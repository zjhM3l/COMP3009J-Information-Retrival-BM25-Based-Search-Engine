Affected Environment 4.6.1 GENERAL GEOLOGY INEEL occupies a relatively flat area on the northwestern edge of the Eastern Snake River Plain.
Figure 4-4 shows important geological features of the INEEL area.
The area consists of a broad plain that has been built up from the eruptions of multiple flows of basaltic lava, which is shown on Figure 4-5.
The flows at the surface range in age from 1.2 million to 2,100 years.
The Plain is bounded on the north and south by the north-to-northwest-trending mountains and valleys of the Basin and Range Provinces, comprised of folded and faulted rocks that are more than 70 million years old.
The Plain is bounded on the northeast by the Yellowstone Plateau.
The seismic characteristics of the Plain and the adjacent Basin and Range Province are different.
Earthquakes and active faulting are associated with Basin and Range tectonic activity.
The Plain, however, has historically experienced infrequent smallmagnitude earthquakes (King et al. 1987; Pelton et al. 1990; Jackson et al. 1993; WCFS 1996).
The major episode of Basin and Range faulting began 20 to 30 million years ago and continues today, most recently with the October 28, 1983 Borah Peak earthquake, which was located approximately 50 miles to the northwest of INEEL.
The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.9 with a ground acceleration of 0.022 to 0.078g at INEEL (Jackson 1985).
No significant damage occurred at the INEEL (Guenzler and Gorman 1985).
4.6 Geology and Soils This section describes the geological, mineral resources, seismic, and volcanic characteristics of INEEL, INTEC, and surrounding areas.

INEEL surficial sediments are derived from rocks from nearby highlands.
In the southern part of INEEL, the sediments are gravelly to rocky and generally shallow.
The northern portion is composed mostly of unconsolidated clay, silt, and sand.
INTEC is situated adjacent to the Big Lost River in relatively flat terrain.
Surface sediments are alluvial deposits of the Big Lost River composed of gravel-sand-silt mixtures 25 to 65 feet thick locally interbedded with silt and clay deposits up to 9.5 feet thick.
The average elevation of INTEC is approximately 4,917 feet above mean sea level.
Detailed stratigraphic information can be found in the Comprehensive RI/FS for the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant OU3-13 at the INEEL - Part A RI/BRA Report (Rodriguez et al. 1997).
As a result of past practices, radioactive and hazardous materials have been released to surface soils at the INTEC.
Best management practices such as monitoring and spill control programs have been implemented to prevent future releases.
Soil sampling including the remedial investigation sampling in 1995, was used to support the Operable Unit 3-13 Remedial Investigation/Baseline Risk Assessment and is documented in the Comprehensive RI/FS for the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant OU3-13 at the INEEL - Part A RI/BRA Report (Rodriguez et al. 1997).
Contaminants found in the soil at INTEC include metals, organic compounds, and radionuclides.
Results from Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act risk assessment investigations at INTEC indicate that radionuclides are the most significant soil contaminants.
Table 4-8 estimates the existing radionuclide activity and mass of non-radionuclide contaminants of concern in soils at INTEC.
4.6.2 NATURAL RESOURCES INEEL mineral resources include sand, gravel, pumice, silt, clay, and aggregate.
These resources are extracted at several quarries or pits at INEEL and used for road construction and maintenance, new facility construction and maintenance, waste burial activities, and ornamental landscaping.
INTEC uses mineral materials extracted from the Test Reactor Area gravel pit 1 mile west of INTEC and the Lincoln Boulevard gravel pit approximately 7 miles north of INTEC.
The geologic history of the Eastern Snake River Plain makes the potential for petroleum production at INEEL very low.
The potential for geothermal energy exists at INEEL; however, a study conducted in 1979 identified no economic geothermal resources (Mitchell et al. 1980).
4.6.3 SEISMIC HAZARDS The Eastern Snake River Plain has a relatively low rate of seismicity, whereas the surrounding Basin and Range has a fairly high rate of seismicity (WCFS 1996).
The primary seismic hazards from earthquakes to INEEL facilities consist of the effects from ground shaking and surface deformation (surface faulting, tilting).
Other potential seismic hazards such as avalanches, landslides, mudslides, and soil liquefaction are not likely to occur at INEEL because the local geologic conditions and terrain are not conducive to these types of hazards.
Based on the seismic history and the geologic conditions, earthquakes greater than moment magnitude of 5.5 and associated strong ground shaking and surface fault rupture are not likely to occur within the Plain, but have been evaluated as part of a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (WCC 1990; WCFS 1996).
However, moderate to strong ground shaking from earthquakes in the Basin and Range could affect INEEL.
Patterns of seismicity and locations of mapped faults are used to assess potential sources of 4-23 DOE/EIS-0287 Affected Environment Table 4-8.

The principal sources of earthquakes that could produce ground motion at INEEL facilities are (WCC 1990; WCFS 1996): Â· Faults The three major range-front faults northwest of INEEL (see Figure 4-4): - - - Â· Beaverhead Fault Lost River Fault Lemhi Fault - Yellowstone 70 miles northeast of INEEL Volcanic Zones The Volcanic Zones on and around INEEL (see Figure 4-4): - - - - - Arco Volcanic Rift Zone Axial Volcanic Zone Great Rift Volcanic Rift Zone Lava Ridge-Hell's Half Acre Volcanic Rift Zone Howe-East Butte Volcanic Rift Zone INEEL seismic design basis events are determined by the INEEL Natural Phenomena Committee and incorporated into the INEEL Architectural and Engineering Standards based on seismic studies (WCC 1990).
New facilities and facility upgrades are designed in accordance with the requirements specified in the DOE-ID Architectural and Engineering Standards (DOE 1998), DOE Order 420.1, and DOE Standard Natural Phenomena Hazards Design and Evaluation Criteria for Department of Energy Facilities (DOE 2002).
The mean peak ground acceleration, determined by the INEEL Natural Phenomena Hazards Committee, has been incorporated into the architectural and engineering standards.
Section 5.2.14, Facility Accidents, presents the potential impacts of postulated seismic events.
Â· Source Zones Other regional source zones that could potentially produce earthquakes affecting INEEL: - - - - - Eastern Snake River Plain background seismicity Northern Intermountain Seismic Belt 15 miles north northeast of INEEL Northern Basin and Range adjacent to and northwest of INEEL Central Basin and Range 50 miles southwest of INEEL Idaho Batholith 50 miles west of INEEL 4-24 4.6.4 VOLCANIC HAZARDS Volcanic hazards include the effects of lava flows, fissures, uplift, subsidence, volcanic earthquakes, and ash flows or airborne ash deposits (Hackett and Smith 1994).
Most of the basalt volcanic activity occurred from 4 million to 2,100 years ago in the INEEL area.
The most recent and closest volcanic eruption occurred at the Craters of the Moon National Monument 26.8 miles southwest of INTEC's main stack (Kuntz et al. 1992).
Based on probability analysis of the volcanic history in and near the south DOE/EIS-0287 Idaho HLW 
The probability is associated primarily with the Axial Volcanic Zone and the Arco Volcanic Rift Zones.
INTEC is located in a lesser lava flow hazard area of INEEL, more than 5 miles from the Axial Volcanic Zone and any volcanic vent younger than 400,000 years.
The probability that basaltic volcanism would affect a south-central INEEL location is less than 2.5Ã—10-5 (once per 40,000 years or longer).
Because of the low probability of volcanic activity during the project duration, volcanism is not discussed further in this section.
monthly extremes of 0 to 5 inches.
The maximum 24-hour precipitation is 1.8 inches.
The greatest short-term precipitation rates are primarily attributable to thunderstorms, which occur approximately 2 or 3 days per month during the summer.
Average annual snowfall at INEEL is 27.6 inches, with extremes of 59.7 inches and 6.8 inches.
Most onsite locations experience the predominant southwest/northeast wind flow of the Eastern Snake River Plain, although terrain features near some locations cause variations from this flow regime.
The wind rose diagrams in Figure 4-6 show annual wind flow.
These diagrams show the frequency of wind direction (i.e., the direction from which the wind blows) and speed at three of the meteorological monitoring sites on INEEL for the period 1988 to 1992.
Multi-year wind roses exhibit little variability and are representative of typical patterns.
INEEL wind rose diagrams reflect the predominance of southwesterly winds that result during 4.7 Air Resources This section describes the air resources of INEEL and the surrounding area.
The discussion includes the climatology and meteorology of the region, a summary of applicable regulations, descriptions of radiological and nonradiological air contaminant emissions, and a characterization of existing levels of air pollutants.
Emphasis is placed on changes in air resource conditions since the characterization performed to support the SNF 
Additional background information is presented in Appendix C.2, Air Resources.
Newly developed information on baseline radiological dose, foreseeable increases in dose, and consumption of Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increment is presented in Sections 4.7.3 and 4.7.4.
4.7.1 CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY The Eastern Snake River Plain climate exhibits low relative humidity, wide daily temperature swings, and large variations in annual precipitation.
Average seasonal temperatures measured onsite range from 18.8Â°F in winter to 64.8Â°F in summer, with an annual average temperature of about 42Â°F (DOE 1995).
Temperature extremes range from a summertime maximum of 103Â°F to a wintertime minimum of -49Â°F.
Annual precipitation is light, averaging 8.7 inches, with 4-25 DOE/EIS-0287 Affected Environment DOE/EIS-0287 4-26 .
Idaho HLW 
Winds from this direction are frequently unstable or neutral, promote effective dispersion, and extend to a considerable depth through the atmosphere.
At night, cool, stable air frequently drains down the valley in a shallow layer from the northeast toward the southwest.
Under these conditions, dispersion is limited until solar heating the following day mixes the plume.
Winds above such stable layers exhibit less variability and provide the transport environment for materials released from INEEL sources.
The highest hourly average near-ground wind speed measured onsite is 51 miles per hour from the west-southwest, with a maximum instantaneous gust of 78 miles per hour (Clawson et al. 1989).
Other than thunderstorms, severe weather is uncommon.
Five funnel clouds and no tornadoes were reported onsite between 1950 and 1997.
Visibility in the region is good because of the low moisture content of the air and minimal sources of visibility-reducing pollutants.
At the Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area, which is approximately 27 miles westsouthwest of INTEC, the annual average visual range is 144 miles (visual range at the time the SNF 
INEEL activities are subject to air quality regulations and standards established under the Clean Air Act and by the State of Idaho (DEQ 2001) as well as to internal policies and requirements of DOE. INEEL occupies portions of five counties (Butte, Jefferson, Bingham, Bonneville, and Clark) in east-central Idaho that are in attainment or are unclassified for all National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
Parts of Bannock County (approximately 30 miles southeast of the INEEL boundary) and Power County (approximately 35 miles south of the INEEL boundary) are designated nonattainment areas for a single criteria pollutant, particulate matter (PM-10).
Air quality standards and programs applicable to INEEL operations are summarized in Appendix C.2.
4.7.3 RADIOLOGICAL AIR QUALITY The population of the Eastern Snake River Plain is exposed to environmental radiation of both natural and human origin.
This section summarizes the sources and amounts of radiation exposure in this region, including sources of airborne radionuclide emissions from INEEL.
4.7.2 STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS Air quality regulations have been established to protect the public from potential harmful effects of air pollution.
These regulations (a) designate acceptable levels of pollution in ambient air, (b) establish limits on radiation doses to members of the public, (c) establish limits on air pollutant emissions and resulting deterioration of air quality due to vehicular and other sources of human origin, (d) require air permits to regulate (control) emissions from stationary (nonvehicular) sources of air pollution, and (e) designate prohibitory rules, such as rules that prohibit open burning.
The Clean Air Act (and amendments) provides the framework to protect the nation's air resources and public health and welfare.
In Idaho, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of Idaho Department of Environmental Quality are jointly 4-27 4.7.3.1 Sources of Radioactivity The major source of radiation exposure in the Eastern Snake River Plain is natural background radiation.
Sources of radioactivity related to INEEL operations contribute a small amount of additional exposure.
Background radiation includes sources such as cosmic rays; radioactivity naturally present in soil, rocks, and the human body; and airborne radionuclides of natural origin (such as radon).
Radioactivity still remaining in the environment as a result of worldwide atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons also contributes to the background radiation level, although in very small amounts.
The natural background dose for residents of the Eastern Snake River Plain is estimated at about 360 millirem per year, with more than half (about 200 millirem per year) caused by the inhalation of radioactive particles formed by the decay of radon (DOE 1997a).
DOE/EIS-0287 Affected Environment INEEL operations can release radioactivity to air either directly (such as through stacks or vents) or indirectly (such as by resuspension of radioactivity from contaminated soils).
Emissions from INEEL facilities include radioisotopes of the noble gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) and iodine; particulate fission products, such as ruthenium, strontium, and cesium; radionuclides formed by neutron activation, such as tritium (hydrogen-3), carbon-14, and cobalt-60; and heavy elements, such as uranium, thorium, and plutonium, and their decay products.
Table 4-9 provides a summary of the principal types of airborne radioactivity emitted during 1995 and 1996 from INEEL facilities.
Releases during this period exclude calciner operations.
Table 4-10 summarizes the airborne radioactivity emitted during 1999 and 2000, which includes calciner operations through May 2000.
4.7.3.2 Existing Radiological Conditions Monitoring and assessment activities are conducted to characterize existing radiological conditions at INEEL and the surrounding environment.
Results of these activities show that exposures resulting from airborne radionuclide emissions are well within applicable standards and are a small fraction of the dose from background sources.
These results are discussed in the following sections for both onsite and offsite environments.
It is important to note that characterizations of existing conditions described in this section do not take into account increases in radionuclide emissions and radiation doses that are projected to occur between the present and the time that the alternatives proposed in this EIS would be implemented.
Projected increases are assessed in combination with existing conditions and impacts associated with the proposed alternatives in Section 5.4, Cumulative Impacts.
Figure 4-7 shows the offsite dosimeter locations, as well as locations where various food products are collected for radioactivity analysis.
Results from onsite and boundary community locations include contributions from background conditions and INEEL emissions.
Distant locations represent background conditions beyond the influence of INEEL emissions.
These data show that over the most recent 5-year period for which results are available (1995 through 1999), average radiation exposure levels for the boundary locations were no different than those at distant stations.
The average annual dose measured by the Environmental Surveillance, Education and Research Program during 1999 was 122 millirem for distant locations and 124 millirem for boundary community locations.
These differences are well within the range of normal variation.
On INEEL, dosimeters around some facilities may show slightly elevated levels, since many are intentionally placed to monitor dose rate in areas adjacent to radioactive material storage areas or areas of known soil contamination (ESERP 2002).
Additional environmental monitoring is also conducted by the State of Idaho's INEEL Oversight Program.
The Oversight Program routinely samples the air, groundwater, soil, and milk on and around INEEL and has also established a network of stations using pressurized ion chambers for real time radiation monitoring around the site.
The Oversight Program also conducts special studies in environmental monitoring as needed.

For purposes of radiological assessment, such a person is referred to as a "noninvolved" worker since the worker is not working directly with the source of the exposure (such as airborne radionuclide releases from adjacent or distant facilities).

However, that projected dose includes contributions from activities (e.g., compacting and sizing activities at the Waste Experimental Reduction Facility) which are not expected to operate over the period covered by this EIS.
An update of the maximum onsite dose is described in Appendix C.2; the revised estimate is 0.27 millirem per year.
This dose is a very small fraction of the DOE-established occupational dose limit (5,000 millirem per year) and below the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants dose limit of 10 millirem per year.
This limit applies to the maximally exposed member of the public (not to workers) but is the most restrictive limit for airborne releases and serves as a useful comparison.
collective dose from background sources of about 43,000 person-rem.
It should be noted that the collective dose depends not only on the types and levels of emissions, but also on the size and distribution pattern of the surrounding population.
Population data were derived from the Census Bureau TIGER/Line files.
When a census tract lay partly with the 50-mile INTEC radius, it was assumed that the fraction of the population within the 50-mile radius was proportional to the area within the radius.
The future baseline population dose could increase even if emission rates do not change.
If emission rates remained constant, the collective dose would increase by an amount that corresponds directly to the population growth rate.
Based on the Census 2000 data, the population within the 50-mile INTEC radius has increased to almost 140,000 (Pruitt 2002).
Offsite Doses The offsite population could receive a radiation dose as a result of radiological conditions directly attributable to INEEL operations.
The dose associated with radiological emissions is assessed annually to demonstrate compliance with the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.
The effective annual dose equivalent to the maximally exposed individual resulting from radionuclide emissions from INEEL facilities during 1995 and 1996 has been estimated at 0.018 millirem and 0.031 millirem, respectively (DOE 1996, 1997b).
These doses are well below both the EPA dose limit (10 millirem per year) and the dose received from background sources (about 360 millirem per year).
The SNF 
The annual collective dose to the surrounding population, based on 1990 U.S. Census Bureau data, was estimated at 0.3 person-rem.
This dose applies to a total population of about 120,000 people (based on 1990 U.S. Census Bureau data), resulting in an average individual dose of less than 3Ã—10-3 millirem.
For comparison, this population receives an annual 4-32 Foreseeable Increases to Baseline DOE also considered the dose contributed by other foreseeable INEEL projects (that is, projects other than those associated with waste processing alternatives or facility disposition).
Estimated annual doses from foreseeable projects are documented in Appendix C.2, (Table C.2-8).
The combined effects of existing and foreseeable sources result in the following annual baseline doses: Â· Â· Â· Noninvolved worker - 0.35 millirem Maximum exposed individual - 0.16 millirem Population - 0.92 person-rem 4.7.3.3 Summary of Radiological Conditions Radioactivity and radiation levels resulting from INEEL air emissions are very low, well within applicable standards, and negligible when compared to doses received from natural background sources.
These levels apply to onsite conditions to which INEEL workers or visitors may be exposed and offsite locations where the general population resides.
Health risks associated with DOE/EIS-0287 Idaho HLW 
4.7.4 NONRADIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS Persons in the Eastern Snake River Plain are exposed to sources of air pollutants, such as agricultural and industrial activities, residential wood burning, wind-blown dust, and automobile exhaust.
Many of the activities at INEEL also emit air pollutants.
The types of pollutants assessed include (a) the criteria pollutants regulated under the National and State Ambient Air Quality Standards and (b) other types of pollutants with potentially toxic properties called toxic (or hazardous) air pollutants.
Criteria pollutants are nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, and respirable particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns in size (particles that are small enough to pass easily into the lower respiratory tract), for which National Ambient Air Quality Standards have been established.
Volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides are assessed as precursors leading to the development of ozone.
Toxic air pollutants include cancer-causing agents, such as arsenic, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, and formaldehyde, as well as substances that pose noncancer health hazards, such as fluorides, ammonia, and hydrochloric and sulfuric acids.
emissions case represented the collective emission rates of nonradiological pollutants experienced by INEEL facilities during 1991 for criteria pollutants and 1989 for toxic air pollutants.
The maximum emissions case represented a scenario in which all permitted sources at INEEL are assumed to operate in such a manner that they emit specific pollutants to the maximum extent allowed by operating permits or applicable regulations.
These emissions were also adjusted to take projected increases (through June 1995) into account.
Actual INEEL-wide emissions for 1996 and 1997 are presented in DOE/ID-10594 and DOE/ID-10646, respectively (DOE 1997c; DOE 1998).
Table 4-11 presents a comparison of actual criteria pollutant emissions during 1996 and 1997 with levels previously assessed in the SNF 
Except for lead, the current (1996 and 1997) critria pollutant emission rates are less than the levels assessed in the SNF 
In the case of lead, the annual average emission rate for 1997 was about eight times the level in the SNF 
For volatile organic compounds, the SNF 
Appendix C.2 (Table C.2-15) describes the ambient air concentrations of criteria air pollutants, including lead, which are associated with actual 1997 INEEL emissions.
It should also be noted that the New Waste Calcining Facility, which historically has been the single largest source of nitrogen dioxide emissions at the INEEL, did not operate during 1996 (DOE 1997a).
In this EIS, DOE analyzes the effects of the New Waste Calcining Facility in conjunction with the specific waste processing alternatives with which this facility is associated.
DOE conducted a screening level risk assessment to evaluate potential adverse human health and environmental effects that could result from the continued operation of the New Waste Calcining Facility.
This evaluation included the operation of the calciner, as well as related systems such as the High-Level Liquid Waste Evaporator and Liquid Effluent Treatment and Disposal Facility.
The results of this evaluation demonstrate that all the potential excess cancer risk, noncarcinogenic health effects, lead expo4-33 DOE/EIS-0287 4.7.4.1 Sources of Air Emissions The types of nonradiological emissions from INEEL facilities and activities are similar to those of other major industrial complexes.
Sources such as thermal treatment processes, boilers, and emergency generators emit both criteria and toxic air pollutants.
Nonthermal chemical processing operations, waste management activities (other than combustion), and research laboratories are potential sources of toxic air pollutants.
Waste management, construction, and related activities (such as excavation) also generate fugitive particulate matter.

One compound (1,3-dinitrobenzene) evaluated in the Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment exceeded its Ecologically-Based Screening Level (EBSL) at its maximum point.
The average soil concentration for this contaminant in the area of major depositional impact was less than the EBSL.
In addition, actual impacts would be significantly less because of conservatism in emissions calculations (Abbott et al. 1999).
The SNF 
(The health hazard associated with toxic air pollutants emitted in lesser quantities is considered low enough by the State of Idaho not to require detailed assessment.)
For a few toxic air pollutants, actual 1996 emissions were greater than the levels assessed in the SNF 
These increases were primarily attributable to decontamination and decommissioning activities.
The specific regulations governing toxic emissions from alternatives analyzed in this EIS are contained in Sections 585 (for non-carcinogenic toxic air pollutants) and 586 (for carcinogens) of Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho DOE/EIS-0287 (IDAPA 58.01.01).
Unlike criteria pollutants, the toxic standards apply only to incremental increases of these pollutants, and not the sum of baseline levels and incremental increases.
4.7.4.2 Existing Conditions The assessment of nonradiological air quality described in the SNF 
The modeling program applied for this purpose utilized computer codes, methods, and assumptions that are considered acceptable by the EPA and the State of Idaho for regulatory compliance purposes.

Onsite Conditions The SNF 
Criteria pollutant levels were assessed only for ambient air locations, (i.e., locations to which the general public has access.)
The onsite levels were compared to occupational exposure limits established to protect workers.
With one exception, the estimated onsite concentrations were estimated at levels well below the occupational standards.
The exception was for the maximum predicted short-term benzene concentration, which slightly exceeded the standard within the INEEL's Central Facilities Area.
Those levels result primarily from gasoline and diesel fuel storage tank emissions at the Central Facilities Area-754; however, those tanks were taken out of service in 1995, and current benzene levels are estimated to be below the occupational standard.
SNF 
Levels at some public road locations, which are closer to emissions sources, are higher than site boundary locations but still well below the reference levels.
Prevention of Significant Deterioration - In the SNF 
These PSD increments are allowable increases over baseline conditions from sources that have become operational after certain baseline dates.
Increments have been established for sulfur dioxide, respirable particulates, and nitrogen dioxide.
Federal land managers (e.g., Bureau of Land Management or National Park Service) are responsible for the protection of air quality values, including visibility, in land areas under their jurisdiction.
The Clean Air Act requires the prevention of any future impairment and the remedying of any existing impairment in Class I federal areas (see Section 4.5, Aesthetic and Scenic Resources for a description of the Visual Resource Management ratings).
Separate PSD increments are established for pristine areas, such as national parks or wilderness areas (Class I areas) and for the nation as a whole (Class II areas).
Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area is the Class I area nearest INEEL, while the site boundary and public roads are the applicable Class II areas.
The amount of increment consumed by existing sources subject to PSD regulation described in this EIS is based on increment consumption analyses recently performed to support a permit application for installation of new oil-fired boilers in the INTEC CPP-606 boiler facility.
For this application, DOE updated source inventory, emission rate, and stack parameter data based on the most recent information, and performed dispersion modeling using both the CALPUFF (Scire et al. 1999) and ISCST3 models.
Offsite Conditions Estimated maximum offsite pollutant concentrations were assessed in the SNF 
The results for baseline criteria pollutant levels (i.e., levels associated with facilities that existed or were projected to operate before mid-1995) are presented in the SNF 
These results, summarized in Table 4-12, indicate that all concentrations are well within the ambient air quality standards.

Assumes all particulate matter emissions are of respirable size (i.e., less than 10 microns).
Particulate matter concentrations do not include fugitive dust from activities such as construction.
Additional standards for smaller sized particles (2.5 microns and less) have been promulgated.
Current air quality levels are well within the proposed standards.
The National Park Service recommends using the CALPUFF model to assess conditions at receptor locations greater than 50 kilometers from the emissions source.
DOE used CALPUFF in the screening mode of operation to estimate maximum increment consumption at Class I area locations at Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area and Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.
For the Class II area on and around INEEL, and for the eastern portion of the Craters of the Moon Class I area, DOE used the ISCST3 model (Version 99155) with the most current three-year set of INEEL meteorological data (1996-1998).
Table 4-13 presents the CALPUFF screening results for distant Class I areas, while Tables 4-14 and 4-15 present the ISCST3 modeling results for the eastern boundary of Craters of the Moon and the Class II area on and around INEEL.
These results represent the estimated amount of PSD increment consumed by the combined effects of emissions from existing INEEL sources subject to PSD regulation including the new INTEC CPP-606 boilers, assuming maximum operational capacity and unrestricted usage (8,760 hours per year).
Except for nitrogen dioxide, these results are generally consistent with those DOE/EIS-0287 presented in the Draft EIS, and the amount of increment consumed at all Class I and Class II areas remains well within allowable levels.
Nitrogen dioxide results are higher because the New Waste Calcining Facility calciner (historically the largest INEEL source of this pollutant) was included in the baseline determination performed to support the INTEC CPP-606 boiler facility permit application, whereas the Draft EIS evaluated this source as part of the Continued Current Operations Alternative and the Planning Basis, Hot Isostatic Pressed Waste, and Direct Cement Waste Options.
Incineration at the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project was included in the Draft EIS baseline but was not included in the CPP-606 permit update; however, projected emissions from that facility are minor and would not add noticeably to increment consumption.
Building on the baseline determination for the CPP-606 permit application, DOE developed a modified baseline for evaluating cumulative impacts for the Final EIS.
This modified baseline excludes the CPP-606 boiler emissions (based on maximum operational capacity), because emissions resulting from fossil fuel consumption in support of the proposed action 4-36 Table 4-13.

4.7.4.3 Summary of Nonradiological Air Quality The air quality on and around INEEL is good and within applicable guidelines.
The area around the INEEL is either in attainment or unclassified for all National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
Portions of Bannock and Power counties in Idaho, near the region of influence, are in a non-attainment area for particulate matter.
For toxic emissions, all INEEL boundary and public road levels have been found to be well below reference levels appropriate for comparison.
Current emission rates for some toxic pollutants are higher than the baseline levels assessed in the SNF 
Similarly, all toxic pollutant levels at onsite locations are expected to remain below occupational limits established for protection of workers.
