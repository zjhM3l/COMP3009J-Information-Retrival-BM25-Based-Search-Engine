Maryland's Tributary Teams Cleaning Up the Chesapeake Bay...One River at a Time
Your River, Your Bay Not everyone lives next to a stream or river, but all of us live in a watershed.
Whether you live right on the water--or, like most Marylanders, within a half mile of your neighborhood stream--your actions on the land can effect water quality in the streams and rivers that feed the Chesapeake Bay.
Maryland's Tributary Teams--comprised of local citizens, farmers, business leaders and government officials appointed by the Governor--are working to keep your local waterways clean and healthy.

By controlling pollution upstream--in the streams and rivers that feed the Chesapeake Bay--Maryland's Tributary Teams are working to make a difference in our neighborhoods, our cities and towns, and the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed.
Water Pollution Begins on the Land Here in Maryland, major cleanup actions are now underway in ten key Bay tributaries, under the guidance of the Tributary Teams.
Using a watershed approach to pollution control, these teams are tackling the nutrients that find their way into our streams and rivers from widely scattered sources on the land.
Excess fertilizers from farm fields and suburban lawns, sewage from old septic systems, and sediment from construction projects all can wash off the land and into our waterways every time it rains.
Even pollution from our own backyards and driveways can find its way into our waterways through the network of storm drains that empty into neighborhood streams and rivers.
Therefore, the way we manage growth in our towns and cities, care for our lawns, run our households, and grow our food can all affect water quality.
What's Being Done
Maryland's Tributary Teams meet regularly in each of the Bay's ten major tributaries to help implement pollution prevention measures needed to address local water quality problems.
These teams are laying the groundwork to ensure clean water and healthy rivers for future generations.
A major focus of their efforts is controlling nutrient pollution from farm fields and horse pastures, wastewater treatment plants, construction and road building activities, and hundreds of thousands of suburban properties.
Developing a pollution control plan unique to each watershed, its population and its land-use patterns is no small task.
Among the pollution control options being implemented in each tributary basin are upgrades to wastewater treatment plants, the planting of stream-side forests to absorb nutrient runoff, best management practices to reduce agricultural runoff and "smart growth" plans aimed at concentrating new development and protecting open spaces and natural habitat.
This coordinated watershed-by-watershed approach brings the Bay cleanup closer to home for the many citizens, businesses and local governments working to protect local waterways and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay
.
The Chesapeake Bay Watershed The Chesapeake Bay Watershed is the land area drained by all the rivers and streams that flow into the Bay.
Home to 14 million people, it extends 64,000 square miles and includes parts of six states and the District of Columbia.
Like all large watersheds, the Bay's watershed is made up of thousands of smaller watersheds that drain into its tributaries.
For example, the Monocacy River Watershed is part of the larger Potomac River Watershed, which, in turn, is part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.
