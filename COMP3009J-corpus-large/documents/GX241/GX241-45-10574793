It is primarily due to the presence of ions of calcium and magnesium, but also to ions of other alkali metals, other metals (e.g. iron), and even hydrogen.
[Glossary of Geology, 4th ed.] TNR: 940 water pH UF: pH (water) BT: water properties RT: hydrology water chemistry DF: Measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution, numerically equal to 7 for neutral solutions, increasing with increasing alkalinity and decreasing with increasing acidity.
The pH scale commonly in use ranges from 0 to 14.
