Nikitas Tsimouris - Tsabounas
by Robert Stone
Nikitas Tsimouris
Shortly after the turn of the century, Greek men began to emigrate to Florida's west coast to work as divers in the state's burgeoning sponge industry.
They established the town of Tarpon Springs, a few miles northwest of Tampa, as one of the world centers for sponge diving.
Today Greek-Americans living in Tarpon Springs continue to practice many elements of traditional culture-foodways, music, dance, religious rituals, crafts and occupational arts-that have been handed down from one generation to the next.
Nikitas Tsimouris was the first Floridian to be awarded the National Heritage Fellowship, the highest honor given by the United States government to traditional artists.
He was recognized for his ability to make an ancient southern Greek bagpipe, known as a tsabouna (pronounced sah-BOO-nah), and for his continued performance on this instrument at weddings, dances and other social functions in Tarpon Springs.
Tsimouris learned to play and make tsabounas from his father, while growing up on Kalymnos, a small Greek island just a few miles west of Turkey.
Most people identify the bagpipe with Scotland.
However, nearly every country in Europe has a bagpipe tradition.
Today playing the tsabouna is a vanishing art, even in Greece.
It is believed that the instrument was developed by herdsmen to pass time while tending sheep and goats.
Tsabouna music is played in rhythmic patterns unlike the two, three, and four beat music to which most Americans are accustomed.
It is dance music and nearly every tune has a song associated with it.
Often the lyrics are improvised spontaneously.
The repertoire of tunes, playing style and melodic ornamentation vary from one Greek island to the next.
Tsimouris makes the tsabouna bag, or touloumi, from a goatskin turned inside out.
First he ties the neck, tail and two leg openings shut.
He then uses string to tightly bind the mouthpiece and chanter of the instrument to the remaining two leg openings.
When he blows the skin full of air and increases the pressure inside the bag by squeezing it with his arms, air forced through the chanter, or marta, vibrates the chanter reeds and produces sound.
The chanter has two cane pipes, one with five finger holes and the other with three.
To tune the chanter, Tsimouris adjusts the gap between each reed and its pipe with a piece of string and reduces the size of the finger holes with pieces of beeswax.
The chanter is mounted in a hollow wooden elbow with a flared opening.
The elbow on Tsimouris's personal instrument was carved from olive wood by his paternal grandfather and passed on to him by his father.
Tsimouris has done his best to ensure that the valued tradition of tsabouna music continues in the community of Tarpon Springs.
He has taught a few young people, most notably his grand-nephew, Nikitas Kavouklis, to make and play the instrument.
