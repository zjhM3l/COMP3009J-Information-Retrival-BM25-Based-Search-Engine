Nature Title Graphic with buttons [birdingtx2.gif] DOCUMENTING RARE BIRDS IN TEXAS Texas Bird Report Form The documentation of rare birds in Texas is an enormous task.
The varieties of habitat within the state and the states proximity to Mexico and the Caribbean Islands make every bird sighting worth a second look.
Written reports on unusual sightings are essential contributions in determining the states species and their range within our boundaries.
A written record that is permanently preserved is a record that can be used by authors, checklist compilers and biologists for many years to come.
A tear-out "special details form" is provided on the last page of this brochure in case you feel you have observed a Texas rarity.
Whenever possible, the submission of photographs should accompany the form.
The value of a photograph cannot be underestimated as a method of confirming a rare species.
A simple sketch, however, can be nearly as valuable (no matter what you may think of its artistic value) as documentation.
Preferably, sketches should be done at the time of the sighting, or as close to it as possible, rather than after.
It is important to note, however, that any documentation, even if it is late and even if you are the fiftieth person who has seen it, is requested and appreciated.
There can never be too much documentation for a rare bird.
After sighting information is submitted, it is then further evaluated by the Texas Bird Records Committee (TBRC), a standing committee of the Texas Ornithological Society.
Your participation in adding to our states growing body of ornithological information is very much encouraged.
WHATS RARE?
Although the word "rare" is a subjective term, there are some species for which documentation is always requested.
The enclosed list of "review species" includes birds that have occurred on an average of four or fewer times per year in Texas on a ten-year average.
Some birds on this list have occurred only one or two times ever in the United States.
Some locally common birds not on this list that are seen far out of their usual range, i.e. Green Kingfisher in north central Texas or Black Skimmer in the Texas Panhandle, should also be documented.
The rule of thumb is "When in doubt, write it out."
This Rare Bird Special Details Form and the list of species which require special details has been provided by Greg Lasley and the Texas Bird Records Committee.
