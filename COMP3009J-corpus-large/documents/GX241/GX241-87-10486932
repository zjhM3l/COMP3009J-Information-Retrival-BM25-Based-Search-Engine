Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project Audits
audits single audit chapter 647
(94-4037-3)
AUGUST 19, 1993 - The OSA found that $23 million was wasted due to the Project's failure to seek community input and approval when constructing a crossing that extended over the Charles River.
As a result, four ramps that had been built now lead to nowhere and will have to be demolished.
(93-4021-3
MAY 23, 2003 - The OSA, in an audit covering the period January 1994 through November 2002, reported today that numerous budgeting and accounting problems have resulted from the Big Dig project management's failure to provide proper oversight of $612 million in project-related work by utility companies and public agencies.(2002-0510-3C4)
JULY 22, 2002 - The OSA reported that over funding of the Project's Management Contingency by $86 million inflates the total cost and will increase state borrowing costs by up to $88 million.
(2002-0510-3C1)
JUNE 26, 2002 - The OSA reported that more than $1 million in unused funds from a Force Account DMB09 was available for use to the CA/T Project.
The unused funds were for a design of a temporary ramp that was instead paid for with funds from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
(2002-0510-3C3)
JUNE 14, 2001 - The OSA reported that it urged the Big Dig to seek reimbursement from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) for $6.9 million in state highway funds that were improperly diverted to the project for design of a rail link between Boston's North and South Stations that may never be built.
Also, failure to resolve a project design issue in a timely manner resulted in increased project costs of $4.5 million.
(99-4074-3)
MARCH 20, 2001 - The OSA reported that Big Dig wrap-up insurance contracts remained unsigned for lengthy periods of time or had never been signed at all.
The OSA noted that operating a multimillion dollar program without comprehensive signed documents was contradictory to sound business practices and demonstrates inadequate internal controls.
(2001-4081-3)
JUNE 14, 2000 - The OSA reported that the Big Dig, after initially resisting recommendations by its office and federal officials, has agreed to use $172 million in unnecessary insurance premiums to offset current and future workers' compensation payments and to pay for other project costs.
This audit is the 12th in a series of interim reports on the Big Dig, which has identified approximately $446 million in unnecessary, excessive and avoidable project costs, as well as available savings opportunities.
(99-4069-3)
FEBRUARY 2, 2000 - OSA audit disclosed that design delays related to construction of the Big Dig's Fort Point Channel crossing resulted in an additional $19 million in costs that could have been avoided .The audit detailed that the timetable was unnecessarily thrown off schedule by the failure of the Massachusetts Highway Department to quickly settle debates surrounding major design issues.
This process was delayed by the reluctance of the Big Dig's management consultant to consider design changes urged by contractors and the federal government.
As a result, the job is already a year behind its original schedule and is unlikely to be finished until late next year.
(98-4061-3)
SEPTEMBER 22, 1999 - The OSA found that although a substantial portion of the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project (Big Dig) budget will be used for project mitigation measures, the project failed to establish a comprehensive system to identify and monitor the activities and related estimated or actual costs associated with the project mitigation.
The audit also disclosed that written policies and procedures governing the approval, record keeping, and monitoring of the project mitigation activities were incomplete.
(97-4059-3)
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 - The Big Dig Project should use $58 million in excess insurance premium payments to cut costs instead of holding onto funds until the year 2017 as currently planned.
The audit reports that this $58 million should be made immediately available to help defray the substantial funding shortfall currently facing the project.
This would also produce the added benefit of reducing project-related debt-servicing costs by approximately $21 million.
(97-4060-3)
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 - The OSA found that $10 million in Big Dig construction expenses could have been avoided if the Massachusetts Highway Department and its management consultant had exercised better controls over design and construction contractors linking the Third Harbor Tunnel with Logan Airport.
(97-4058-3)
JULY 14, 1997 - At least $8.4 million was spent unnecessarily on the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project when the Massachusetts Highway Department took two years to resolve a major design dispute between themselves and the Massachusetts Port Authority.
The dispute centered around the design of the ramps connecting the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport.
(97-4054-3)
MARCH 11, 1996 - At least $32 million was spent unnecessarily due to the project's rush to open the Third Harbor Tunnel in December 1995.
That total is expected to rise to $45 million.
The Massachusetts Highway Department authorized construction to proceed before related design work had been completed and before resolving conflicts with an adjacent contractor's schedule.
(95-4044-3)
SEPTEMBER 13, 1995 - The OSA found that $3 million was wasted when the Massachusetts Highway Department and its management consultant failed to provide adequate oversight over certain design activities associated with the Third Harbor Tunnel tubes.
Specifically, a welding design problem exposed the project to potentially dangerous safety conditions, and added $625,688 in additional costs; a shortfall in over seven feet of tunnel tube length added $504,650 in additional costs to the project; and inadequate controls over a cancelled design change involving a tunnel tube hatch closure created a potentially dangerous situation.
Additionally, a defective tunnel section would not anchor to the harbor floor, causing contractors to weight the section down with heavy machinery, or be faced with the section floating away with the next incoming tide.
Further, money was needlessly spent due to the project's inability to complete a land taking deal on time.
(94-4039-3)
OCTOBER 17, 1994 - OSA auditors found that $64 million in unnecessary costs were added to the project because of a design and construction problem that led to unsupportable walls at the Logan Airport construction site.
(94-4037-3)
AUGUST 10, 1994 - As much as $11 million was wasted because of the Massachusetts Highway Department's failure to coordinate work schedules for contractors doing work at a tunnel entrance at Logan Airport.
The OSA expected that the total amount of unnecessary expenditures related to this portion of the project would jump to $30 million.
(93-4034-3)
APRIL 8, 1994 - OSA identified $7 million needlessly spent when a dispute occurred between environmental officials and the Massachusetts Highway Department concerning the excavation of contaminated materials.
The project was delayed for months because the dispute would not allow for either the storage or the disposal of the dirt.
(93-4027-3)
AUGUST 19, 1993 - The OSA found that $23 million was wasted due to the Project's failure to seek community input and approval when constructing a crossing that extended over the Charles River.
As a result, four ramps that had been built now lead to nowhere and will have to be demolished.
(93-4021-3
) To date, the OSA's Division of Audit Operations has issued three reports related to the CA/T Project that have detailed the following: MASSACHUSETTS HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT'S BRIDGE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (December 9, 1997) This audit disclosed that badly needed repairs of the state's bridges, reported by the federal government to be among the worst in the nation, could be placed in jeopardy by shortages of state and federal highway funds, as well as by the state's financial commitment to the Central Artery project.
As of the date of the release of this audit, 15 percent of Massachusetts' 4,445 state and municipally owned bridges were structurally deficient and another 26 percent were functionally obsolete, meaning they did not meet current roadway design criteria.
While the Highway Department had made some progress in reducing the number of structurally deficient bridges, the number of functionally obsolete bridges increased in the past five years.
In addition, although the Highway Department's maintenance efforts had addressed the most critical structural deficiencies, they had not corrected many other deficiencies which can eventually worsen the condition of bridges to the point where major rehabilitation or replacement is necessary.
Finally, 40 percent of the state's bridges had not been rated to determine their current safe load-carrying capacity.
Furthermore, 11 percent of the bridges that had been rated were not posted for weight limits.
The six audit results contained in the report disclosed a total of $304 million in questionable costs.
MASSACHUSETTS PORT AUTHORITY; JOINT ASSET ASSESSMENT STUDY OF SEGMENTS OF THE METROPOLITAN HIGHWAY SYSTEM
(July 28, 1999) - The OSA reported that a $294 million contribution by the Massachusetts Port Authority to the Central Artery project could lead to a hike in Logan International Airport landing fees that would make the airport less competitive with other airports in the region.
MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE AUTHORITY
(January 28, 1999) -
The OSA uncovered more than $338 million in questionable financing and operating costs, investments, and unreported assets that were related to the CA/T Project.
Specifically, the OSA found unnecessary financing costs of $38 million, questionable and imprudent investments of $227 million, understated road and tunnel net operating costs of $24 million, and unreported assets of $49 million
