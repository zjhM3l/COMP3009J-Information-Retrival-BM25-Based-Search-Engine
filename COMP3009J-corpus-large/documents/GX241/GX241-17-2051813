Sweetwood reviewed the convictions against Mr. Meehan.
Mr. Poepsel stated that he would be focusing on Mr. Meehan's most recent conviction for bookmaking on December 8, 2000.
Mr. Poepsel stated that rule 18.016 states "may be excluded", which, is not an absolute.
He reviewed the case, stating that the December 8 conviction was not for bookmaking on horse races, that the bookmaking was for sporting events.
He also stated that Mr. Meehan is a harmless person at the race track and that he is a visible person as far as security is concerned and not a threat to the integrity of horse racing.
He stated that Mr. Meehan should be allowed to be let back in to Horsemen's Park.
Judge Jack McGrath spoke on behalf of Mr. Meehan.
He stated that he does not know Mr. Meehan on a social basis, but, volunteered to speak today because he has been a big part of the industry and feels as though Mr. Meehan made a mistake.
He believes that Mr. Meehan, who is retired, loves horse racing and loves to be at the track.
Mr. Meehan stated that he enjoys Horsemen's Park and that he doesn't bother anyone and that he is there a lot.
Chm. Lee asked Mr. Meehan if he had ever booked a horse racing bet, to which Mr. Meehan answered not at Horsemen's Park.
Chm. Lee asked Mr. Dick Moore if he had ever received any complaints regarding Mr. Meehan, to which Mr. Moore answered that he had never received any complaints and that Mr. Meehan was very well liked at Horsemen's Park and that he had received a lot of feedback from other patrons in regards to whether or not Mr. Meehan would be returning.
Sweetwood asked the Commission not to remove the exclusion of Mr. Meehan from the Commission grounds based on the conviction and the Commission rules.
Chm. Lee reviewed the Commission's role in regard to the integrity of horse racing.
Lee moved, seconded by Beveridge, to modify Mr. Meehan's suspension of patron privileges from a period of five years to a period of 90 days from the date of the letter of suspension, conditional to any subsequent gambling conviction of any kind, anywhere or if our investigators become aware of Mr. Meehan bookmaking or illegal activity for anything, then the exclusion will return to five years.

GOVERNING HORSE RACING IN NEBRASKA

3.007.05 - Alcoholic beverages banned in the jockey's room 
custodian responsibility
Chm. Lee stated that these were new rules that were being proposed.
He also stated that a letter from Senator Dwite Pedersen had been received, requesting that these rules be placed in the rule book.
Chm. Lee stated that there was a directive that was in effect for the 2001 live race meet that was adopted stating that alcoholic beverages were banned in the jockey's room.
Mr. David Moore, Jockey Guild, questioned why the ban was being implemented for after the races were over.
He agreed with the ban for before and during the races, but after the races some of the jockeys like to have a beer.
Chm. Lee asked if he would approve a rule stating that alcoholic beverages be banned before and during the races.
Mr. Moore stated that he would agree to that.
No action was taken.
9.001.41 - Post positions 
R.E. Lee stated that they needed to work on rule 9.001.41 because it interferes with the preference rules at each track.
He agreed with rule 9.001.42.
Oelschlager stated that rule 41 and 42 were amended and created in response to R.E. Lee's request that the rule needed to be clarified.
He stated that other issues have arisen and that more discussion needed to done.
No action was taken.
11.005.01 - Jockey mount fees 
David Moore, Jockey Guild, stated that he would like to see the wording, `in the absence of a written agreement, the following jockey mount fees apply:'.
He also stated that every other state that he has requested jockey mount fee increases has accepted them and that Nebraska jockey's have not had a raise since 1987 and he feels that Nebraska needs to approve this raise.
He stated that RCI and NAPRA have both accepted this raise.
R.E. Lee stated that every time the Horsemen get a raise (purse money) the jockey's get a raise.
He also stated that they were struggling in Nebraska to keep horsemen and horses in Nebraska and that by the time the horsemen pay all of the fees that have to be taken out of the purse, there really isn't much left.
R.E. Lee stated that as far as 11.005.02 he felt that when they gave them the 10% increase that this was the rule that they agreed upon, but it was alright to delete the language anyway.
Mike Kelley, Atty., stated that economics is the biggest factor for the disapproval of the increase.
He also stated that he did not think that it was legal for the Commission to set a fee.
He wanted the Attorney General to review this rule and give his opinion because Mr. Kelley felt that the Commission did not have the authority to set fees between two parties outside of the Commission.
Perry Compton, Jockey, stated that there expenses were increasing as well and felt like they deserved an increase.
No action was taken.
18.011 - Rights of horsemen 
Chm. Lee requested that a change should be made within rule 18.011 where it states `RCI Drug Testing and Quality Assurance Program' it should read `RCI Drug Testing Standards and Practices Programs' which is the current name of this program.
Chm. Lee reviewed the proposed rules as they were amended and asked for any comments.
Mr. Kelley stated that this amendment was exactly what they had asked for and they agreed with the changes.
No action was taken.
JOCKEY WEIGHT - INCLEMENT CONDITIONS
Chm. Lee stated that the Stewards adopted a directive in regard to Jockey weight during inclement conditions and would be decided if the waiver would be in effect on a day-by-day basis.
Oelschlager reviewed the discussion that had occurred between management, stewards and jockeys.
Haberlan said that the directive was self explanatory.
David Moore stated that sometime extra clothing weighs more than two pounds and thought that the directive should be more lenient.
Chm. Lee stated that the directive gives discretion to the stewards on a day-by-day basis depending on the weather and can adjust the limit to fit the need.
More discussion followed.
