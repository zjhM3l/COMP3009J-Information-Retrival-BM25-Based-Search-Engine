They are also in serious jeopardy, threatened by an increasing array of impacts from overexploitation, pollution, habitat loss, invasive species, diseases, and climate change.
The rapid decline and loss of these valuable marine ecosystems has significant social, economic, and environmental consequences in the U.S. and around the world.
Action is needed on a wide variety of fronts to address the coral reef crisis, especially on issues of global proportions such as the impacts of climate change, increasing coastal development and persistent over- fishing o f reef systems.
This document, A National Coral Reef Action Strategy, was produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in cooperation with the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (Task Force), to fulfill the requirements of the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 (CRCA) (P.L. 106- 562; 16 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) and help track implementation of The National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs (U.S. Coral Reef Task Force 2000).
The Task Force National Action Plan was the first national blueprint for U.S. action to address the loss and degradation of U.S. and international coral reef ecosystems.
Based on extensive input from government and non- government organizations, scientists, resource managers, stakeholders and the public, the Nationa l Action Plan: (1) identified key threats and issues driving the loss and degradation of coral reefs, (2) established thirteen major goals to address these threats, and (3) outlined objectives and priority actions needed to achieve each goal.
The CRCA requires the NOAA Administrator to prepare, periodically review, and revise a national coral reef action strategy to achieve the purposes of the CRCA.
To fulfill the se requirements, NOAA worked closely with the Task Force, Task Force Working Groups and the All Islands Coral Reef Initiative to build on the existing goals, objectives, implementation plans , and other information associated with the National Action Plan.
That information was used as the foundation for this strategy.
The strategy is divided into two fundamental themes and 13 goals essential to addressing and reducing threats to coral reefs worldwide: Ã¯Â¿Â½ THEME 1: Understand Coral Reef Ecosystems Better understanding of complex coral reef ecosystems will improve management and conservation of these valuable resources.
The strategy outlines the following major goals to increase understanding of coral reef ecosystems: Goal 1: Create comprehensive maps of all U.S. coral reef habitats; Goal 2: Conduct long-term monitoring and assessments of reef ecosystem condition; Goal 3: Support strategic research to address the major t hreats to reef ecosystem s; and Goal 4: Increase understanding of the social and economic factors of conserving coral reefs. ______________________________________________________________________ _______ iii National Coral Re ef Action Strategy Executive Summary ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Ã¯Â¿Â½ THEME 2: Reduce The Adverse Impacts Of Human Activities Reducing the impacts of human activities is essential to conserving coral reef ecosystems.
The strategy outlines the following major goals to reduce the adverse impacts of human activities: Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: Improve the use of m arine protected area to reduce threat s; Reduce adverse impacts of fishing and other extractive uses; Reduce impacts of coastal uses; Reduce pollution; Restore damaged reefs; Improve education and outreach; Reduce international threats to coral reef ecosystems; Reduce impacts from international trade in coral reef species; and Improve coordination and accountability.
This initial version of the strategy is designed to help track progress to implement the CRC A and National Action Plan in 2002 2003.
The docume nt provides an assessment of the major threats and needs in each region to help identify and prioritize key areas for management action.
For each of the 13 goal areas outlined in the National Action Plan, the document provides partial summaries of accomplishments in 2001, and partial lists of key actions need ed in 2002- 2003 to help achieve the goals and objectives of the CRCA and National Action Plan.
This document is not intended to be a comprehensive list of a ccomplishments or future needs.
Where possible, the Strategy indicates how to access more comprehensive information from the Task Force (see http://coralreef.gov/ or Appendix B for list of contacts) or other sources involved in coral reef conservation activities.
As required by the CRCA, this document also provides estimates of federal funding available to directly support coral reef conservation activities.
The National Action Strategy is designed to be revisited biennially (or as need) to track progress and help identify future needs and actions in cooperation with the Task Force, the All Islands Coral Reef Initiative, other organizations, constituents and the public.
A comprehensive process for future updates is being developed in cooperation with the Task Force.
Input is encouraged on all aspects of the National Action Strategy (please see contact information listed in the front of the document). ______________________________________________________________________ _______ iv National Coral Reef Action Strategy ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The National Coral Reef Action Strategy was produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce, in cooperation with federal and non- federal (state, t erritory and commonwealth) members and staff of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.

These rainforest s of the sea provide economic and environmental services to millions of people as areas of natural beauty and recreation, sources of food, jobs, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and shoreline protection.
Now under threat from multiple stresses that are overwhe lming their natural resilience, coral reefs are deteriorating worldwide at alarming rates.
The Status of Coral Reefs of the World 2000 report estimates that 27 percent of the world's coral reefs have been effectively lost due to human activities and climate impacts (Wilkinson 2000).
By 1997, an estimated 11 percent of the world's reefs had been lost to a variety of human activities including shoreline development, polluted runoff from agricultural and land - use pract ices, over- harvesting, destructive fishing, and ship groundings.
In 1998, a massive climaterelated coral bleaching event destroyed or degraded an additional 16 percent of the coral reefs of the world.
It is estimated that an additional 32 percent of the world's coral reefs are now seriously threatened.
If urgent manage ment action is not taken to protect these ecosystems , a total of 40 percent of the world 's coral reefs may be lost by 2010, particularly those near human populations.
I f current pressures continue unabated, 58 percent may be lost by 2030.
In many areas, the trend in coral reef health is downward, and these ancient ecosystems are in peril.
In other areas, there is not adequate monitoring and information to assess the reef condition, or determine the effectiveness of management actions .
Recent assessments of U.S. reef ecosystems suggest that many U.S. reefs are under increasing threats and are showing clear signs of serious degradation from human impacts (Bryant et al 1989; Turgeon et al 2002).
In response to this crisis, the U.S. has taken a number of significant actions over the past 5 years to help halt the decline of coral reef ecosystems and sustain the communities and economies that depend on them.
In 1998, the U.S. Cor al Reef Task Force (Task Force) was established by Executive Order 13089 to help lead and coordinate U.S. efforts to address the coral reef crisis.
The Task Force, cochaired by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, includes the heads of eleven federal agencies (Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of the Interior, Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, U.S. Agency for International Development) and the Governors of seven s tates, territories and commonwealths (American Samoa, Florida, Guam, ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 1 National Coral Re ef Action Strategy Introduction ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Hawaii, Northern Marianas Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands) with responsibilities for coral reefs .
In March 2000, the Task Force adopted the National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs (National Action Plan), the first national blueprint for U.S. action to address the loss and degr adation of valuable U.S. and international coral reef ecosystems (U.S. Coral Reef Task Force 2000).
The National Action Plan was produced by the Working Group s of the Task Force in response to its request for a cohesive national strategy to implement the President's 1998 Executive Order 13058 on Coral Reefs .
The National Action Plan also incorporated the coral reef strategies of state and territory members of the Task Force ( U.S. a ll Islands Coral Reef Initiative Strategy 1999 ).
The National Action Plan was developed in consultation with a diverse variety of stakeholders and covered the spectrum of coral reef conservation activities, from mapping, monitoring, management and research, to education and international cooperation.
Based on extensive input from government and non- government organizations, scientists, resource managers, stakeholders and the public, the National Action Plan (1) identified key threats and issues driving the loss and degradation of coral reefs, (2) established thirteen major goals to address these threats, and (3) outlined specific objectives and priority actions needed to achieve each goal.
This document, A National Coral Reef Action Strategy (strategy), was produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in cooperation with the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, to fulfill the requirements of the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 (CRCA) (P.L. 106- 562; 16 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) and implement the National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs.
The CRCA requires the NOAA Administrator to prepare, periodically review, and revise a national coral reef action strategy to achieve the purposes of the CRCA.
The CRCA states that NOAA may consult with the Task Force in developing the strategy.
The strategy is to include a statement of goals and objective s, an implementation plan, and a description of the funds obligated each fiscal year to advance coral reef conservation.
The CRCA also requires NOAA to establish a coral reef conservation grants program to address priorities identified in the national strategy.
The Act states that the strategy shall include a discussion of: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Coastal uses and management; Water and air quality; Mapping and information manageme nt; Research, monitoring, and assessment; International and regional issues; ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 2 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Introduction ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Outreach and education; Local strategies developed by the states and federal agencies, including regional fishery management councils; and Conservation, including how marine protected areas will be developed in a manner consistent with local practices and traditions to serve as replenishment zones.
To fulfill these requirements, NOAA worked closely with the Working Group s and representatives of the Task Force to build on the existing goals, objectives, implementation plans , and other information associated with the National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs.
This information was used as the foundation for this strategy, although, this s trategy does not necessarily represent the views of the Task Force.
Action is needed on a wide variety of fronts to address the coral reef crisis, especially on threats of global proportions such as the impacts of climate change on reef systems (Best et al 2002).
The actions and strategies described in this document depend on a variety of other efforts by governmental and non- governmental entities to successfully address threats and reverse the degradation and loss of coral reef ecosystems.
STRATEGY TO CONSERVE CORAL REEFS The s trategy is designed to track progress and needs to fulfill the purposes of the CRCA and implement the National Action Plan by providing a mechanis m to biennially (or as needed) : (1) provide information on the major threats and needs in each region, (2) track progress to achieve the goals and objectives, and (3) identify priority actions needed to achieve the goals and objectives.
It also provides estimates of federal funding available to support coral reef conservation activities as required by the CRCA.
Based on the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs, this strategy is divided into two fundamental themes and 13 goals crucial to addressing and reducing threats to coral reefs worldwide: Ã¯Â¿Â½ THEME 1: Understand Coral Reef Ecosystems - Better understanding of complex coral reef ecosystems will improve management and conservation of these valuable resources.
The strategy outlines the following major goals to increase understanding of coral reef ecosystems: Goal Goal Goal Goal 1: 2: 3: 4: Create comprehensive maps of all U.S. coral reef habitats; Conduct long-term monitoring and assessments of reef ecosystem condition; Support strategic research to address the major threats to reef ecosystems; and Increase understanding of the social and economic factors of conserving coral reefs.

The strategy outlines the following major goals to reduce the adverse impacts of human activities: Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: Improve the use of marine protected area to reduce threats; Reduce adverse impacts of fishing and other extractive uses; Reduce impacts of coastal uses; Reduce pollution; Restore damaged reefs; Improve education and outreach; Reduce international threats to coral reef ecosystems; Reduce impacts from international trade in coral reef species; and Improve coordination and accountability.
This initial s trategy focuses on track ing and implement ing the CRCA and the National Action Plan in 2001 2003.
It includes partial summaries of accomplishments in 2001 and partial lists of key needs to be addressed by government and non- governmental entities in 2002- 2003 to help achieve the goals and objectives outlined in the CRCA and the National Action Plan.
It is intended to provide brief summaries and access to additional information.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of accomplishments or future needs.
Additional information is available in annual reports from the member organizations and working groups of the Task Force (see http://coralreef.gov/ or Appendix B for list of contacts) or other sources and organizations involved in coral reef conservation activities.
The strategy is designed to be revisited bie nnially (or as need), in cooperation with the Task Force, other organizations, and the public, to track progress and help identify future needs and actions.
A comprehensive process for the development of future reports is being prepared in cooperation with the Task Force.
CONSTRAINTS ON FEDERAL AGENCY ACTION This document identifies goals and objectives set forth in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs, accomplishments towards reaching those goals, and key actions needed in 2002- 2003 to fulf ill the purposes of the CRCA and implement the National Action Plan.
This document is intended to help track progress and guide future actions.
However, all decisions on future actions remain the responsibility and authority of federal or other governmental agencies, subject to appropriate authorities and fiscal constraints as outlined below.
______________________________________________________________________ _______ 4 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Introduction ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Resource Constraints .

______________________________________________________________________ _______ 5 National Coral Reef Action Strategy valuable ecosystems in peril major threats CORAL REEFS -- THREATENED ECOSYSTEMS regional impacts CORAL REEFS ECOSYSTEMS AT RISK A. CORAL REEFS ARE VALUABLE ECOSYSTEMS Coral reefs and their associated sea grass and mangrove habitats are among the most diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth.
These reef systems are storehouses of immense biological wealth and provide economic and environmental services to millions of people as shoreline protection, areas of natural beauty, recreation and tourism, and sources of food, pharmaceuticals, jobs, and revenues.
According to one estimate, these rainforests of the sea may provide good and services valued at $375 billion each year a n amazing figure for an ecosystem that covers less than one percent of the Earth's surface (Costanza et al., 1997).
The U.S. has significant interest s in protecting our Nation's coral reef ecosystems .
U.S. coral reefs cover approximately 17,000 square kilometers of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
Current estimates suggest that approximately ninety percent of U.S. reefs are located in the Western Pacific (i.e. Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands); the remainder is located near Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
In add ition, reef habitats play a central cultural role in many U.S. islands, where community- based management, subsistence fisheries, and protected areas have historically been part of local culture and practice.
The U.S. also has interests in helping to protect coral reef ecosystems internationally.
Healthy marine ecosystems are critical to U.S. efforts to promote economic and food security, social stability, democratic governance, improved human health, disaster and climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation in many countries.
Coral reef ecosystems have great economic, social a nd cultural importance to many Nations and entire regions ( Best et al 2002; Cesar 2000).
These valuable ecosystems constitute the economic and biological foundation for sustainable development in many countries, particularly small island nations.
In addition, the health and value of many U.S. coral reefs depends on the condition of reef ecosystems in other countries.
For example, juvenile corals, fish, and other reef species are carried by currents from the broader Caribbean and Central America to U.S. coral reefs in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Florida.
This "seeding" of U.S. reefs from non- U.S. is important to sustaining healthy U.S. reef systems.
These currents can also carry potentially harmful pollutants and diseases, further emphasizing the need for sound ocean and coastal management internationally.
Similarly, the coral reefs of many of the U.S. Pacific territories are ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 6 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Coral Reefs Ecosystems At Risk ______________________________________________________________________ ________ connected to those of other Indo- Pacific reefs.
Conserving coral reefs is a challenge of global dimensions.
Coral reefs provide a vast array of valuable services to the Nation and the world (Cesar 2000).
For example : TOURISM -- The tourism industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of the global economy.
U.S. coral reefs are a major destination for snorkelers, scuba divers, recreational fishers, boaters and sun seekers.
Diving tours, fishing trips, hotels, restaurants, and other businesses based near reef systems provide millions of jobs and contribut e billions of dollars in tourism- dependent revenue annually in many U.S. regions .
Recent studies show that millions of people visit coral reefs in the Florida Keys every year, and these reefs support significant economic activity through sales, income and employment.
For example, over 3.6 million people participated in a reef- related activity in the Florida Keys coral reefs of Monroe County in 2001.
These reefs supported $363 million in sales, $106 million in income, 8,000 jobs and an asset value of $1.8 billion.
Overall for southeast Florida's coral reefs, 18 million people participated in reef related activities during 2001, and these reefs are estimated to have an asset value of $7.6 billion (Johns et al., 2001).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ FISHING Approximately 50 percent of all federally managed fisheries species depend on coral reefs for part of their life cycle (TASK FORCE Coastal Uses Working Group Summary Report , 1999).
The annual dockside value of commercial U.S. fisheries from coral reefs is over $100 million (NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service).
The annual value of reef- dependent recreational fisheries probably exceeds $100 million per year.
In developing countries, coral reefs contribute about one - quarter of the total fish catch, providing critical food resources for tens of millions of people (Cesar 2000).
COASTAL PROTECTION -- Coral reefs buffer adjacent shorelines from wave action and prevent erosion, property damage and loss of life.
Reefs also protect the highly productive mangrove fisheries and wetlands along the coast, as we ll as ports and harbors and the economies they support.
Globally, half a billion people are estimated to live within 100 kilometers of a coral reef and benefit from its production and protection.
BIODIVERSITY -- Reefs support more species per unit area than any other marine ecosystem, including about 4,000 documented species of fish, 800 species of hard corals and hundreds of other species.
Scientists estimate that there may be another 1 to 8 million undiscovered coral reef species (Reaka- Kudla 1997).
In many ways, coral reefs rival and surpass tropical rainforests in their biological diversity and complexity.
This biodiversity may be a source of natural products derived from reef dwelling organisms.
Many pharmaceuticals are now under development from coral reef animals and plants as possible cures for cancer, arthritis, human bacterial infections, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 7 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Coral Reefs Ecosystems At Risk ______________________________________________________________________ ________ viruses, and other diseases.
Coral reef ecosystems are considered to be a key source of natural compounds for new medicines for the 21st century.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ NATURAL HERITAGE -- Coral reefs are an important part of our natural heritage, rivaling the longevity and complexity of some treasured land - based ecosystems like old growth forests, Joshua trees, Sequoia trees, Saguaro cacti, and other ancient features.
For example, a well- developed reef may be the manifestation of thousands of years of incremental accretion by its resident coral colonies, sometimes growing outwards only millimeters each year.
Many coral species have no known limit on colony size or age and can thus continue growing indefinitely in favorable habitats.
As a result, some of the largest individual coral colonies found on U.S. reefs today were almost surely alive centuries ago, long before modern uses and pressures developed.
The scientific, aesthetic and conservation value s of such ancient animals and their complex biogenic habitats are unparalleled in the world's oceans, and indeed on land as well.
These are truly living museums of the world's marine biological diversity.
B. MAJOR THREATS TO CO RAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS The value of coral reefs to the Nation is matched only by their vulnerability to harmful environmental changes, particularly those resulting from human activities.
In 2000, the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network estimated that 27 percent of all coral reefs were effectively lost; a total of 40 percent of the world's coral reefs may be lost by 2010, particularly those near human populations; and, if current pressures continue unabated, 58 percent may be lost completely by 2030 unless urgent management action is taken to reduce human impacts on reef ecosystems (Wilkinson 2000).
Over the past decade, many expert groups have documented and evaluated t he growing number of anthropogenic threats to coral reefs, and possible management so lutions to reduce these threats (Bryant 1998; Wilkenson 2000; Burke 2002 ; Best et al. 2002; Schuttenberg 2001; Turgeon et al 2002 ).
The U.S. Coral Reef Task Force identified 7 specific and widely accepted threats as being particularly important, and tractable, for immediate action by its member agencies and non- governmental partners: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ POLLUTION, including eutrophication and sedimentation from poor or overly intensive land use, chemical loading, oil and chemical spills, marine debris and invasive alien species.
OVER- FISHING AND OVER- EXPLOITATION of coral reef species for recreational and commercial purposes, and the collateral damage and degradation to habitats and ecosystems from fishing activities.
HABITAT -DESTRUCTION AND HARMFUL FISHING PRACTICES Ã¯Â¿Â½ , including those fishing techniques that have negative impacts on coral reefs and associated habitats.
This can include legal ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 8 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Coral Reefs Ecosystems At Risk ______________________________________________________________________ ________ techniques such as traps and trawls used inappropriately, as well as illegal activities such as cyanide and dynamite fishing.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ DREDGING AND SHORELINE MODIFICATION in connection with coastal navigation or development.
VESSEL GROUNDINGS AND ANCHORING DISEASE OUTBREAKS that directly destroy corals and reef framework.
that are increasing in frequency and geographic range are affecting a greater diversity of coral reef species.
and associated impacts including reduced rates of coral calcification, increased coral bleaching and mortality (associated with variety of stresses including increased sea surface temperatures), increased storm frequency, and sea level rise.
GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE C. RANKING OF MAJOR THREATS TO CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS BY REGION In developing this strategy, NOAA worked closely with representatives from the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, re gional managers, scientists and others to identify the major threats or causes of reef decline and loss in each region as a first step in understanding the key problems to be addressed in each area.
The results of this assessment are shown in Table 1.
Table 1 provides a general summary of the relative impact (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of natural and human- related threats to U.S. and international coral reefs in each region.
The rankings were provided by regio nal scientists and managers, and representatives to the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, for use in this report and the first biennial report on the status of U.S. coral reef ecosystems (Turgeon et al 2002).
Please refer to the Table for specific rankings of threats in each region or jurisdiction.
In general, t he Table illustrate s that: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The relative impact of different threats varied by jurisdiction and region.
Some jurisdictions had a few high impact threats; most indicated 6- 7 of the 13 threats having high impact.
Some threats are consistently ranked as having high to medium impact on reefs across most regions (e.g., coastal development and run- off; coastal pollution; fishing; ships, boats and groundings).

Under these themes, the strategy includes thirteen major goals to guide U.S. action to address the most serious threats to U.S. and international coral reefs.
For each goal, the document outlines (1) the importance of the goal in addressing the major threats to reefs, (2) the s trategy and major objectives, (3) a partial summary of recent accomplishments to address the goal, and (4) a partial summary of actions needed in 2002- 2003 to implement the s trategy and achieve the goal and objectives.
Information for the strategy was produced in cooperation with the Working Group s of the Task Force and state, territory and commonwealth representatives of the All Islands Coral Reef Initiative.
It is intended to provide brief summaries and access to additional information.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of accomplishments or future needs.
More comprehensive information is available from the member organizations and Working Group s of the Task Force (see http://coralreef.gov/ or Appendix B for list of contacts), the All Islands Coral Reef Initiative, and other sources and organizations involved in coral reef conservation activities.
The strategy is designed to be revisited biennially (or as need) to track progress and he lp identify future needs and actions, in cooperation with the Task Force and other organizations, constituents and the public.
A comprehensive process for the development of future reports is being prepared in cooperation with the Task Force.

ASSESSMENT OF PRIORITY ACTIONS TO REDUCE THREATS TO U.S. CORAL REEFS Table 3 is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of actions under the goals and objectives outlined in the strategy, to address key threats to U.S. coral reef ecosystems in each region.
The rankings were provided by official state, territory or commonwealth representatives to the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force in each region for use in this document.
A higher ranking suggests that conducting activities under the goal and objectives are considered more important to addressing current threats to coral reefs in the region.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under the goal or objective may make significant contributions, they are currently less important to address the major threats to coral reefs in the region.
The actual importance of each goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on conditions, location and other factors.
In general, the results illustrate that the priority ranking of actions to address the goals varies among regions, although some goal/action areas consistently ranked as high priority needs across most or all regions to reduce threats to coral reefs.
The following goal or action areas were ranked as high priority needs by all or most U.S. regions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Map all shallow U.S. coral reefs; Monitor and assess reef conditions (living resources); Monitor and assess reef conditions (assess water and substrate quality); Improve use of marine protected areas (strengthen existing marine protected areas); Reduce adverse impacts of fishing (reduce overfishing); Reduce pollution (reduce sedime nt pollution); Improve education and outreach (increase awareness); and Reduce international threats to reefs (increase capability for resource management).
C. ASSESSMENT OF PRIORITY ACTIONS TO REDUCE THREATS TO INTERNATIONAL CORAL REEFS.
Table 4 is a ge neral summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of actions under the goals and objectives (outlined in the strategy) to address key threats to international coral reef ecosystems by region.
The rankings were provided by official r epresentatives to the International working group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force for use in this document.
A higher ranking suggests that conducting activities under the goal and objectives are considered more important to addressing current threats to coral reefs in the region.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under the goal or objective may make significant contributions, they are currently less important to address the ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 13 National Coral Reef Action Strategy National Coral Reef Action Strategy ______________________________________________________________________ ________ major threats to coral reefs in the region.
The actual importance of the goals or objectives in addressing threats to reefs will vary within and between regions depending on conditions, location and other factors.
The results illustrate that (1) actions to address the goals vary in their priority among regions, and (2) there are some actions considered high priority across many regions (e.g., monitor and assess reef conditions, monitor global warming, reduce overfishing, reduce pollution, reduce threats to international reefs, reduce impacts from international trade, and strengthen existing MPAs).
D. ACTION THEME 1: UNDERSTANDING CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS Coral reefs are imperiled throughout many areas (Bryant et al 1998; Wilkenson 2000; Turgeon et al 2002).
Threatened by a growing number suite of natural and anthropogenic stresses, including nutrient over- enrichment, sedimentation, over- fishing, climate change, bleaching, disease and habitat destruction, coral reef ecosystems are deteriorating worldwide at alarming rates.
The origin and impacts of these threats range fr om very localized and potentially manageable events, such as resource extraction or coastal development, to poorly understood global phenomena affecting entire ocean basins (e.g. climate change, bleaching and disease)(Best et al 2002).
The challenge of interpreting, predicting and responding to such stressors on coral reefs is further exacerbated by the complexity and variability of reef ecosystems in space and time.
Adjacent reefs on the same coastline may be inexplicably different, while a single reef ma y cycle through significant changes in composition and health in response to unknown events.
Ultimately, our success or failure in conserving these highly complex and valuable ecosystems will depend on how well we can develop and apply proactive, precautionary management measures.
To do this requires a much more sophisticated level of understanding about their fundamental ecology and response to environmental stressors.
As this knowledge base evolves, it will provide invaluable support for management actions such as the siting of new marine protected areas or the development of more effective pollution standards.
To achieve this level of management will require a coordinated effort to determine the status of coral reefs, the causes of coral reef decline, or the impact of natural and anthropogenic stress on coral reef and associated ecosystems (Best et al 2002).
To meet these needs, this portion of the strategy builds on the same four goals adopted by the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force in its National Act ion Plan to increase understanding coral reef ecosystems to implement long- term conservation measures: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Goal Goal Goal Goal 1: 2: 3: 4: Map All U.S. Coral Reefs; Assess, Monitor and Forecast Coral Reef Health; Conduct Strategic Research; and Understand Social and Economic Factors.

The figure below is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal in reducing the impacts from these threats.
A higher ranking suggests that activities under this goal are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contr ibutions, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.
The actual importance of this goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on location and other factors (see Tables 3 a nd 4 for regional comparisons).
Destructive Fishing Practices Habitat Destruction Global Warming/ Climate Change Coastal Pollution Sedimentation 
This need is particularly acute for coral reef ecosystems where reef- dwelling communities may be very different over s hort distances and where the consequences of misinformed management decisions, such as the placement of potentially harmful human activities, can have devastating and lasting ecological consequences.
Comprehensive maps and habitat assessments form the foundation for a variety of reef conservation measures including: creating accurate baselines for long- term monitoring; identifying and protecting essential fish habitat; illustrating important community- scale trends in coral reef ecosystem cond itions over time; characterizing habitats for place- based conservation measures such as marine protected areas (MPAs); and enabling scientific understanding of the large - scale oceanographic and ecological processes affecting reef ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 15 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Overuse from Tourism Vessel Groundings Vessel Discharges Coastal Development Overfishing THREATS Diseases Goal 1: Map all shallow U.S. reefs ______________________________________________________________________ ________ health.
Habitat maps will also help managers predict the impacts of natural and anthropogenic stresses such as disease outbreaks, hurricanes, harmful algal blooms, oil spills, vessel groundings, and coastal pollution, run- off, and development.
Thus recent, accurate, and carefully designed mapping products are a cornerstone of most coral reef ecosystem conservation and management efforts.
MAPPING STRATEGY: The s trategy to achieve this goal is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Mapping and Information working group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.

This, in turn, depends on monitoring programs that track trends in coral reef ecosystem health and reveal patterns in their condition before irreparable harm occurs.
Monitoring can also play a vital role in guiding and supporting the establishment of complex or potentially controversial management strategies such as no - take ecological reserves, fishing gear restrictions, or habitat restoration, by documenting the impacts of gaps in existing management schemes and illustrating the effectiveness of new measures over time.
Long- term monitoring is also required to determine the effectiveness of various ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 21 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Overuse From Tourism Vessel Groundings Vessel Discharges Coastal Development Overfishing THREATS Diseases Goal 2: Assess, Monitor and Forecast Reef Health ______________________________________________________________________ ________ management strategies to conserve and enhance our coral reef ecosystems.

Assessing and tracking changes in reef communities in response to environmental stressors or specific human activities and uses.
Evaluating the effectiveness of specific management strategies and identify actions for future adaptive responses.
Evaluating the natural recovery and/or restoration of injured or degraded reefs.
Enabling informed decisions about the location of potentially harmful activities by providing baseline data on community composition and predicted ecosystem response.
Providing baselines for assessing catastrophic damage from natural or anthropogenic events such as storms, diseases, climate change, coral bleaching, vessel groundings, and toxic spills.
Serving as an early warning system for identifying declines in coral reef ecosystem health.
The Task Force National Action Plan calls for a coordinated national program to assess, inventory and monitor the health of U.S. coral reef ecosystems.
This monitoring- based goa l is directly linked to the goal to map all U.S. coral reefs as the digital benthic habitat maps aid in designing and implementing local, regional, and national monitoring programs.
Many of the research- based activities also complement or are directly linked to on going monitoring programs within the states, territories, commonwealths, and the Federal Government.
As government and non- governmental partners continue to integrate coral mapping, research, and monitoring studies into a national monitoring effort, the nation's ability to assess coral reef conditions will continue to increase.
ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING STRATEGY The strategy to achieve this goal is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Monitoring subgroup of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more information see http://coralreef.gov/ .
The strategy includes the following three major objectives : Objective 1: Working closely with partners and stakeholders, develop and implement a nationally coordinated, long- term program to inventory, assess and monitor U.S. coral reef ecosystems.
Develop a web- enabled data management and information system for U.S. reef monitoring and mapping data, with user- friendly GIS- based mapping and Objective 2: ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 22 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 2: Assess, Monitor and Forecast Reef Health ______________________________________________________________________ ________ querying capability to present complex information in usable formats to all potential users, while ensuring the security of sensitive place- based biological or cultural resource data.
Objective 3: Develop and produce a biennial report on the State of U.S. Coral Reef Ecosystems.
SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS (2001) In 1999, 50 of the Nation's coral reef managers and scientists drafted a detailed implementation plan for A National Program to Assess and Monitor Coral Reef Ecosystems (National Program) in FY 1999.
In FY2000, NOAA facilitated a workshop for 60 coral reef managers to evaluate the relative importance of environmental threats impacting local reefs and prioritize management needs (e.g., biotic inventories monitoring, research, mapping, and assessments of the sources and extent of reef degradation).

These and other key processes remain only partially understood, and this paucity of knowledge hampers effective management actions needed to conserve and sustainably manage coral reef ecosystems.
For instance, it is clear that new diseases are emerging at an accelerated rate, and mortality from disease has modified the structure and composition of coral reefs across the Caribbean by removing common and locally abundant species.
However, most diseases have not been critically or thoroughly characterized, disease etiologies remain largely unknown, and most cause and effect relationships are not well documented.
______________________________________________________________________ _______ 28 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Overuse from tourism Vessel groundings Vessel discharges Coastal Development Overfishing THREATS Diseases Goal 3: Conduct Strategy Research ______________________________________________________________________ ________ The policy and decision- making processes necessary for effective conservation of reef ecosystems are influenced by equally complex socioeconomic and polit ical systems.
Important decisions such as the establishment of MPAs, implementation of fishery regulations, or regulation of coastal development usually cover large spatial scales and may be in effect for long time periods.
They involve the integration o f a wide range of interlinked considerations, but are often based on limited biophysical and socioeconomic information.
The science in support of these decisions is often conducted on much smaller spatial and temporal scales.
I n many cases the science is highly specialized with results that are difficult to apply directly to policy decisions, or the science may be completely lacking.
The ability to halt and reverse degradation of coral reef ecosystems depends on develop ing a better understanding of the structure and function of coral reef ecosystems, how human activities influence coral reefs, and then using this understanding in making management decisions that sustain and restore coral reef ecosystems .
RESEARCH STRATEGY The s trategy to achieve this goal is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and associated documents of the Ecosystem Science and Conservation working group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
This s trategy relies on coordinating research among agencies, academia, industry, and NGOs to address the priority research and management needs.
The goal is to develop a nationally coordinated research program by fulfilling the following three objectives : Objective 1: Conduct a long- term regional and ecosystem- based research program to improve our understanding of processes that govern the structure, function, and health of coral reef ecosystems.
Build capabilities to address ecosystem- scale threats such as disease, bleaching and other sources of mass mortalities.
Develop and transfer technology for faster and more accurate mapping, assessment, monitoring, and restoration.

Destructive Fishing Practices Habitat Destruction Global Warming/ Climate Change Coastal Pollution Sedimentation 
Coral reef ecosystems in nearshore waters are particularly vulnerable to the effects and impacts of human activities, both through direct exploitation of reef resources, and through the indirect impacts of adjacent land- based activities such as polluted runoff from coastal development.
The converse is also true the livelihoods and prosperity of people living in coastal tropical areas depend on, and influence, the condition of the marine resources.
Therefore, coral reef ecosystem uses, management, and ecology can not be considered in isolation.
Coastal activities and their eventual impacts on reefs, are inextricably woven into the social, cultural, and economic fabric of regional coastal communities.
Consequently, meaningful reductions in human impacts on reefs will require a greater understanding of, and management attention to, the underlying motivations ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 34 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Overuse from Tourism Vessel Groundings Vessel Discharges Coastal Development Overfishing THREATS Diseases Goal 4: Understand Social and Economic Factors ______________________________________________________________________ ________ and beliefs that influence our commitment to conserving healthy coral reef ecosystems.
Understanding the socioeconomic context of the reef stakeholders is essential for assessing, predicting, and managing reef use.
To balance sustainable use and protection, the reef manager needs to know the people that use and affect the reef, including their use patterns, perceptions of reef management, and characteristics.
This human dimension, which is crucial to the long- term success o f management strategies, is often ove rlooked.
It is particularly important among many of the U.S. Islands, in which traditional uses of coral reef resources, including subsistence fishing, have been an integral part of locally managed sustainable use for generations.
SOCIOECONOMIC STRATEGY The s trategy to achieve this goal is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Social and Economic S ubgroup of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more detailed information see http://coralreef.gov/ .
In recognition of the fundamental importance of the human dimension to successful coral reef conservation, the social, economic and cultural dimensions o f coral reef issues are also integrated into other goal areas.
The strategy outlines three objectives to meet the goal of increasing understanding the social and economic factors necessary for effective coral reef conservation: Objective 1: Objective 2: Objective 3: Assess the social and economic uses of coral reef systems, and monitor human communities that use/depend on coral reef ecosystems.
Assess the social and economic impacts of reef management on human communities.
Assess the social, economic and cultural value of reef resources.

(NOAA) Implementation Plan 2002-2003 The Social and Economic subgroup of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, working with many partners, has identified some priority actions in FY 2002 and 2003 to achieve the goal and objectives outlined in this strategy.
Successful implementation of the strategy is contingent on funding and other factors and relies on efforts by a variety of partners.
The following is a partial summary of key actions needed from government and non- governmental entities in 2002- 2003 to help fulfill the objectives.
More detailed information is available from the subgroup and member organizations of the U.S. Coral Reef Ta sk Force (http://coralreef.gov/).
To Address Objective 1: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Incorporate socioeconomic mapping into existing biophysical mapping projects to strengthen coral reef management and ensure effective decision- making.
Evaluate examples of traditional and community- based coral reef conservation efforts on coral reefs, particularly in the U.S. Islands, and transfer the lessons learned to other management programs.

______________________________________________________________________ _______ 37 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 4: Understand Social and Economic Factors ______________________________________________________________________ ________ E. ACTION THEME 2: REDUCING HUMAN IMPAC TS The most severe of the growing number of threats to coral reefs stem directly from human activities.
Human impacts on reefs range from direct exploitation of specific natural resources (e.g. fishing, coral and live rock extraction, and sand mining), to more diffuse degradation of large reef tracts caused by runoff of sediment or polluted waters from urban areas, mangrove deforestation, coastal development or other upland activities.
These impacts a re exacerbated by degradation of the overall marine environment due to global climate change.
While the nature and magnitude of human impacts vary tremendously among reefs domestically and internationally, in the U.S., many of the underlying activities are authorized and regulated under law and therefore can be managed or mitigated using existing federal and state authorities and programs tailored to local needs.
In addition, human impacts stemming from lands under private ownership can be minimized through voluntary implementation of various model conservation measures.
On a broader scale, consumer and life style choices made every day by Americans and others around the world contribute to global warming, pollution, overexploitation and other stresses on coral reefs worldwide.
To a very real extent, the future of U.S. coral reefs depends on our capacity to reduce or eliminate avoidable human impacts, both domestically and internationally.
To that end, this portion of the strategy focuses on reducing human impacts on coral reef ecosystems.
It builds on 9 of the critical conservation goals adopted by the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force in its National Action Plan.
This strategy is designed to reduce or eliminate the most significant and tractable threats to coral reefs through the action towards the following goals : Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Goal 5: Improve the Use of coral reef marine protected areas ; Goal 6: Reduce Impacts of Fishing and Other Extractive Uses; Goal 7: Reduce Impacts of Coastal Uses; Goal 8: Reduce Pollution; Goal 9: Restore Damaged Reefs; Goal 10: Improve Outreach and Education; Goal 11: Reduce Threats To International Coral Reefs; Goal 12: Reduce Impacts From International Trade; and Goal 13: Improve Coordination and Accountability.

The figure below is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal in addressing the impacts from these threats.
A higher ranking suggests that activities under this goal are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rank ings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contributions, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.
The actual importance of this goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on location and other factors (see Tables 3 and 4 for regional comparisons).

Widely accepted in the terrestrial environment, the principle of setting aside fully representative examples of all ecosystem and habitat types to ensure conservation of biodiversity has been adopted only recently for the marine environment.
MPAs constitute a broad spectrum of areas that are afforded some level of protection for the purpose of managing resources for sustainable use, safeguarding ecosystem function and biodiversity, and/or providing a framework for supporting uses of resources and space with a ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 39 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Vessel discharges Diseases Goal 5: Improve Use of Marine Protected Areas ______________________________________________________________________ ________ minimum of conflict.
They can range from small to very large, and may protect a specific resource or habitat type, to extensive areas that integrate the management of many species, habitats, and uses in a single, comprehensive plan.
The level of protection can range from multiple use areas to no - take ecological reserves1 that are closed to all extractive uses.
Like their terrestrial counterparts, today's MPAs can provide for the protection of critical habitats and endangered species, e nhance tourism and recreation, and serve important roles in public education and outreach on the social, economic and ecological benefits of marine ecosystems and their protection.
By employing a framework for the application of "adaptive management," MPAs can establish and maintain feedback loops between science and policy.
Finally, multiple - use MPAs address the differing objective s of a wide variety of stakeholders, thereby providing a framework for resolving conflict marine and coastal ecosystem services users, while providing conservation benefits to coral reef ecosystems.
MPAs in the U.S. are administered at the local, territorial, state, regional and federal levels of government.
This fragmented set of MPAs often results in under- representation of types of reefs and other habitats within biogeographic regions, inadequate protection of reef resources, competing or conflicting resource objective s, and lack of coordination among management agencies.
Under the current system, long- term conservation and sustainable use of coral reef resources are difficult to achieve.
A coordinated network of MPAs encompassing representative coral reef ecosystems could be designated to limit fragmentation and build a robust network for sustainable use and conservation of coral reef ecosystems.
Central to the success of an MPA network is the meaningful and sustained public participation by key stakeholder groups in all phases of the design, implementation and evaluation of this system.
This will help ensure that MPAs, including replenishment zones, will be developed consistent with, and supportive of, local practices and traditions.
Stakeholders include: (a) resource managers from governmental agencies with jurisdiction or expertise relevant to coral reef resources and habitats; (b) commercial and recreational users and stakeholders, including Regional Fishery Management Councils; (c) non- governmental organizations ; and (d) coral reef scientists and other subject matter experts.
Moreover, the development of an integrated network of coral reef MPAs will necessarily take into account appropriate legislative and regulatory authorities at all levels of government, with particular emphasis on involving the island states and territories in the evaluation, design, establishment and implementation of component sites.
1 No -take reserves, also called ecological reserves, harvest refugia, and fully -protected MPAs, are one type of marine protected area where all extractive uses are prohibited.
Many studies have shown that no -take reserves are particularly effective in maintaining biodiversity, productivity and ecological integrity o f coral reefs.
No -take reserves may also serve as fishery "replenishment zones " and help sustain fisheries outside of the protected area.
No -take reserves can complement other fishery management approaches such as gear restrictions and temporary or seasonal closures.
______________________________________________________________________ _______ 40 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 5: Improve Use of Marine Protected Areas ______________________________________________________________________ ________ This issue is of particular importance in the Pacific Islands, where traditional, community- based and subsistence uses of nearshore coral reef habitats, including protected areas, are intimately linked to cultural values and practices.
CORAL REEF MPA STRATEGY The s trategy to achieve this goal is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and associated documents of the Ecosystem Science and Conservation working group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more detailed information see http://coralreef.gov/.
The goal is to build a nationally linked and coordinated network of MPAs, including but not limited to no- take reserves, representing a functionally viable proportion of all coral reefs and associated habitats under the jurisdiction of the U.S..
The U.S. will also encourage steps in this direction in the Freely Associated States (FAS) of the Republic of Palau, Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
An explanation of the scientific basis for the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force's Objective concerning no- take reserves is found in the Task Force Ecosystem Science and Conservation Working Group report "Building a National System of Marine Protected Areas for Coral Reefs" (available at http://coralreef.gov), based on numerous scientific papers (e.g., Lauck et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 1999; Murray et al., 1999; Sladek- Nowlis et al., 1999; Watson et al., 2000), and summarized in Bohnsack et al. entitled "A rationale for minimum 20-30 percent no-take protection" (in press in Coral Reefs).
Bibliographic references are found in both documents.
The goal of 20 percent by 2010 is based on the best available science and is supported from a number of scientific fields including reproductive theory, knowledge about the vulnerability of reef species to exploitation, analysis of fishery failures, and empirical and modeling studies of reserves.
The s trategy outlines five key ob jectives to achieve this goal: Objective 1: Objective 2: Conduct and support nation- wide, state and territory assessments of the effectiveness and gaps in the existing system of U.S. coral reef MPAs.
Develop proposals for establishing new MPAs and enhanc ing effectiveness of existing areas as appropriate through existing authorities and involvement of all constituencies.
Strengthen capabilities of existing MPAs to protect coral reef resources thro ugh review and revision of existing sites, applicable management plans, programs, policies and authorities.
Objective 3: ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 41 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 5: Improve Use of Marine Protected Areas ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Objective 4: Establish additional coral reef MPAs where needed.
This includes establishing additional "no take" ecological rese rves in a balanced suite of representative U.S. coral reefs and associated habitats, with the goal of protect ing at least 5 percent of all coral reefs and associated habitat types in each major island group and Florida as ecological reserves by 2002; at least 10 percent by 2005, and at least 20 percent by 2010.
Strengthen and support cooperation with and among the Freely Associated States and international partners to establish networks of MPAs to protect and conserve reef ecosystems.2 Objective 5: SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS (2001) The following is a partial summary of recent accomplishments by federal and non- federal members of the U.S. Coral Reef Ta sk Force to achieve the goal and objectives.

To Address Objective 5:2 Note: It appears likely that the U.S. overall will not meet the Task Force National Action Plan goal for 2002 of 5 percent of coral reefs in no-take ecological reserves in each major island group and Florida.
Only Guam and the NWHI have reached (and indeed exceeded) this 2002 goal.
Guam has exceeded the 2010 goal of 20 percent of representative habitats in no-take ecological reserves.
A status report on this goal and the area of U.S. coral reefs in protected area status is included in the 2002 State of U.S. Coral Reef Ecosystems report (Turgeon et al 2002).

Develop cooperative agreements between the U.S. and FAS to assist in establishing new MPAs based on needs and priorities assessment and coordinating management strategies for new MPAs through a regional network.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 46 National Coral Reef Action Strategy GOAL 6: REDUCE ADVERSE IMPAC TS OF FISHING AND OTHER EXTRACTIVE USES KEY THREATS ADDRESSED: Reducing the adverse impacts of fishing and other extractive uses is critical to reducing key threats to coral reef ecosystems.
The figure below is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal in addre ssing the impacts from these threats.
A higher ranking suggests that activities under this goal are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contributio ns, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.
The actual importance of this goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on location and other factors (see Tables 3 and 4 for regional comparisons).
Extreme Biotic Events Vessel Groundings Destructive Fishing Practices Habitat Destruction Global Warming/ Climate Change Coastal Pollution Sedimentation 
Fishing plays a central social and cultural role in many island communities.
The rich biodiversity of reefs also supports a valuable marine aquarium industry and promises rich genetic resources for pharmaceuticals or other natural products.
However, these fishery resources and the ecosystems that support them are under increasing threat from overfishing and fishing- associated impacts on habitats and ecosystems.
Potential threats of fishing include: 1) direct over- exploitation of fish, invertebrates and algae for food and the ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 47 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Vessel Discharges Diseases Goal 6: Reduce Impacts of Fishing ______________________________________________________________________ ________ aquarium trade; 2) physical impacts to ree f environments associated with fishing techniques and fishing gear; 3) impacts that occur over a wide range of trophic levels as a result of the removal of a species or group of species; and 4) by- catch of non- target species.
Overfishing of high value species, resources such as groupers, snappers, sharks, and certain crustaceans and mollusks, has been documented on nearly all U.S. inshore reefs near populated islands (Health of U.S. Coral reef Ecosystems 2001).
These species are becoming depleted in more remote offshore reefs and in deep reef environments, and fisheries catches are shifting to smaller and less desirable species.
Giant clams and large groupers have become commercially extinct in several areas.
I n the western Atlantic, four spe cies of groupers are now listed as candidates for protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
Furthermore, the abundance of the top ten aquarium fish in Hawaii decreased by 59 percent over two decades at Honaunau, Hawaii (Clark 
In addition to changes in the abundance, composition and demography of targeted reef fish populations, dramatic changes in the structure of coral reefs have also been documented.
For instance, the removal of predatory fishes may result in accelerated bioerosion of corals by the invertebrate prey that these fishes formerly held in check, while overfishing of herbivorous fishes has resulted in overgrowth of coral reefs by algae.
Certain fishing techniques and gear are causing considerable habitat damage and/or entanglement of benthic reef flora and fauna.
F ish traps and large gill nets are of particular concern in Florida, Puerto Rico, USVI and coral banks in the Gulf of Mexico.
Other impacts associated with fisheries include anchor damage, trawling in deep reef environments, and grounding of fishing vessels.
Fishing pressure and fisheries impacts represent one of the largest, most widespread, and most difficult to address threats to coral reef ecosystems.
Most reef fisheries in U.S. waters are smallscale, multispecies, and inadequately monitored, managed, and enforced.
Improved management of coral reef fisheries requires better scientific information, increased coordination, better enforcement of existing regulations and new management approaches that protect biodiversity and ecosystem functions while regulating fishing and other extractive uses.
STRATEGY TO REDUCE ADVERSE IMPACTS The goal of this strategy is reduce the adverse impacts of coral reef fisheries in order to ensure their sustainable management and the conservation of the ecosystems on which they depend to benefit local communities and the Nation.
The strategy is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Coastal Uses working group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more detailed information see http://coralreef.gov/ .
This strategy outlines seven key objectives to achieve this goal: ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 48 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 6: Reduce Impacts of Fishing ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Objective 1: Identify, monitor and protect critically important U.S. coral reef fisheries habitats and spawning populations through an expanded network of no - take ecological reserves.5 Ensure effective enforcement of existing no - take fishery reserves, monitor reef fish stocks in no - take marine reserves and reference sites to evaluate the effectiveness of reserves, and identify and protect new areas necessary to ensure the integrity of fisheries and ecosystems.
Reduce overfishing by monitoring coral reef fisheries, assessing the adequacy of current fishing regulations, revising regulations as needed ( in the case of Federal regulations this will be conducted utilizing existing statutory processes), and providing enhanced enforcement and education.
Enhance coordination on coral reef fishery issues with the U.S. territories in the Caribbean and Wester n Pacific.
Reduce adverse environmental impacts of fishing 6 by assessing essential fish habitat; identifying effects of fishing and fishing gear, and implementing actions or additional gear and fishing vessel anchoring restrictions to reduce habitat damage; eliminating destructive fishing practices; and assessing and mapping deeper coral reefs, banks and beds, and developing strategies to conserve these deeper ecosystems.
Incorporate ecosys tem- scale considerations into coral reef fishery management.
This will require targeted research, including the development of models, to understand ecosystem effects of fishing and socioeconomic studies on the impacts of different options.
It will requir e work with s tate and territory resource management agencies, Fishery Management Councils and other interested entities Objective 2: Objective 3: Objective 4: Objective 5: 5 No -take reserves are areas protected from all fishing and other extractive use.
As a habitat and ecosystem-based protection measure, such reserves potentially offer a high level of protection for coral reef structure, and ecosystem function and complement other fishery management tools such as gear restrictions or seasonal closures .
An explanation of the scientific basis for the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force's goals for no-take reserves on U.S. coral reef ecosystems is found in the Report of the CRT Working Group on Ecosystem Science and Conservation: "Building a National System of Marine Protected Areas for Coral Reefs" (http://coralreef.gov/) and in Bohnsack et al. (in press).
Work to achieve this objective related to federally managed fisheries will be one through existing statutory processes.
6 The National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs also included removal of derelict fishing gear from this item as well as in "Reduce Pollution."
As the great concentrations of derelict fishing gear found on Pacific reefs come from distant water fisheries rather than coral reef fisheries, this item is dealt with under the "pollution" section.
______________________________________________________________________ _______ 49 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 6: Reduce Impacts of Fishing ______________________________________________________________________ ________ to incorporate this understanding into ecosystem- level local fishery management and Federal Fishery Management Plans for coral reef areas.
Objective 6: Reduce the overexploitation of reef organisms for the aquarium trade 7 by: banning the commercial domestic collection of coral and "live rock" and monitoring the collection of other species; developing new management measures or ecologically sound alternatives to wild collection; evaluating the effectiveness of existing legal authorities and policies governing the collection and importation of coral and other reef- dwelling species; and addressing inconsistencies among federal and state/ territorial regulations on collection and trade of ornamental coral reef species.
Develop a process to evaluate issues and possibly develop guidance related to coral reef aquaculture in conjunction with stakeholders and relevant interagency groups including the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force and the Invasive Species Council.
Objective 7: SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS (2001) The following is a partial summary of recent accomp lishments by federal and non- federal members of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to achieve the goal and objectives.

______________________________________________________________________ _______ 53 National Coral Reef Action Strategy GOAL 7: REDUCE IMPACTS OF CO ASTAL USES KEY THREATS ADDRESSED: Reducing the impacts of vessel groundings, development and other coastal uses is important to reducing threats to coral reef ecosystems.
The figure below is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal in addressing the impacts from these threats.
A higher ranking suggests that activities under this goal are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contributions, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.
The actual importance of this goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on location and other factors (see Tables 3 and 4 for regional comparisons).
Extreme Biotic Events Vessel Groundings Destructive Fishing Practices Habitat Destruction Global Warming/ Climate Change Coastal Pollution Sedimentation 
Coastal activities like dredging for navigation or marinas, constructio n of breakwaters and other hardened shoreline protection measures, beach renourishment, sand mining, pipelines and cable installation, and land - use practices (e.g. road construction, mangrove deforestation, and land reclamation for agricultural and urban development) decrease water quality around reefs.
Increased coastal tourism has led to increased pressure on coral reef resources, either through direct impacts on the reefs or indirectly through increased levels of coastal development, sewage discharge, vessel traffic, etc.
Other activities ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 54 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Vessel Discharges Diseases Goal 7: Reduce Impacts of Coastal Uses ______________________________________________________________________ ________ also ha ve the potential to adversely impact coral reef ecosystems (e.g., security training exercises).
As the number of people using and transiting coral reefs increases annually, so too has the frequency of vessel groundings on reefs.
In the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary alone, an average of 574 small vessel groundings have been reported within the coral reef ecosystem over the last four years, and hundreds more go unreported.
Vessels striking shallow coral reefs can cause profound damage to the habitat by dislodging, crushing and fracturing the benthic community, displacing resident fishes, and eliminating critically important topographic complexity and habitat structure that is the result of hundreds of years of growth.
In addition, propeller scarring, anchoring and other physical impacts are of growing concern in nearshore habitats.
Some impacted habitats cannot recover without direct, and often expensive, human intervention in the form of immediate clean up of debris, emergency triage of injured animals, stabilization of unconsolidated surfaces and reinforcement of the reef framework, and long- term restoration of habitats and benthic communities.
These growing pressures are signs of the rapid growth in coastal populations and tourism over the past few decades, and of current resource limitations in programs responsible for implementation and enforcement of existing conservation authorities.
Many of the adverse habitat impacts of coastal development, shoreline modification and vessel groundings can be prevented through consistent and proactive application of existing federal and state authorities and programs.
While vessel groundings are unlikely to be completely avoided, prompt and careful removal of the vessel and evaluation of the injurie s, followed by a rapid implementation of remedial actions can significantly reduce collateral damage and enhance survivorship of corals and other reef species.
STRATEGY TO REDUCE IMPACTS O F COASTAL USES The goal of this s trategy is to reduce the impact of human coastal activities on coral reef ecosystems.
The strategy is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Coastal Uses Working Group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more detailed information see http://coralreef.gov/ .
The strategy includes six broad objectives to minimize impacts from coastal uses: Objective 1: Develop informal guidance, protocols and technical assistance programs to reduce the risks of damage to coral reefs resulting from activities conducted, funded or approved by federal agencies.
Strengthen, improve, and integrate federal and state permitting and management programs for coastal development activities impacting coral reef habitats by developing technical Objective 2: ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 55 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 7: Reduce Impacts of Coastal Uses ______________________________________________________________________ ________ guidance, impact thresholds, and policy directives that minimize or prevent adverse impacts to coral reef ecosystems.
Objective 3: Initiate actions at the national and international levels to prevent vessel groundings and other vessel- related impacts by improving seamanship, strengthening aids to navigation, enhancing vessel traffic management measures; installing and maintaining mooring buoys in areas where anchor damage is likely.
Develop standard vessel grounding response, enforcement and injury assessment guidance and improve our ability to remove grounded and abandoned vessels and restore damaged habitat by enhancing local and regional emergency response capabilities, strengthening and standard izing enforcement and damage assessment actions, and identifying gaps in existing legal authorities Strengthen existing and develop new resource management programs and protected areas to address the broad range of coastal activities.
This may include developing new programs, policies, and regulations to address resource protection threats.
Develop mitigation guidelines for coastal development projects that are deemed essential by federal state and territory agencies.

The figure below is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal in addressing specific threats to coral reefs.
A higher ranking suggests that activities to reduce pollution are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contributions, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.

Destructive Fishing Practices Habitat Destruction Vessel Groundings Coastal Pollution Invasive Species Sedimentation 
Coral reef ecosystems need clean, clear water and healthy habitats, both of which can be imperiled by pollution.
Many coral reef ecosystems are currently impacted by a variety of pollutants, including sedimentation, nutrients, chemical contaminants, marine debris, and invasive, non- native species (biological pollutants).
Pollution enters reef ecosystems in many ways, ranging from specific point sources such as sewage pipes and vessel discharges, to more diffuse runoff from land based sources such as agriculture, coastal development, road construction, and on- site waste water management systems, to airborne sources such as emissions from automobiles and power ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 60 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Vessel Discharges Diseases Goal 8: Reduce Pollution ______________________________________________________________________ ________ plants.
Reef degradation is even greater in areas where the loss of wetland s or other habitats has reduced nature's ability to filter nutrients and other pollutants before they reach the reefs.
Conserving the Nation's coral reef ecosystems requires reductions in the concentrations and cumulative impacts of pollution from a variety of sources.
Land use practices such as deforestation, coastal infrastructure and road construction, logging, and agriculture in coastal watersheds can produce large amounts of sediment being carried in runoff, streams and rivers to coral reefs .
Sediments smother corals and decrease water clarity, leading to a variety of impacts on the reef ecosystem including reduced coral cover, diversity, and recruitment.
Excess nutrient loading from inadequate treatment and disposal of human and animal waste, and surface runoff from urban and agricultural lands, can also lead to significant changes and damage to the reef community.
Discharges of oil, garbage, and ballast water from vessels can also impact coral reef species.
Marine debris from fishing or other sources also has impacts on some reef ecosystems.
Introductions of invasive species are also of serious concern in some areas, particularly through the discharge of ballast water from visiting vessels that can transport alien species from one region to another.
POLLUTION REDUCTION STRATEGY The goal is to reduce the quantity and impacts of sediment , nutrient , marine debris, and biological pollutants (e.g., invasive species ) on coral reef ecosystems.
The U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Water and Air Quality Working Group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force outline the strategy to achieve this goal.
For more detailed information see http://coralreef.gov/ .
The s trategy has two main parts divided into seven objectives : (1) developing tools to assess the biological, chemical, and physical conditions of coral reef ecosystems, and (2) reducing the major types of pollution impacting coral reef ecosystems.
The first part (development o f tools to assess and reduce the impacts of pollution) is also discussed in the Assessing and Monitoring Reef Health, and Conducting Strategic Research sections of the strategy.
Objective 1 : Reduce sedimentation and other land- based sources of pollution by improving land - use and management practices in coastal watersheds t hrough public- private partnerships, incentive- based measures, technical and financial assistance, habitat restoration and other activities.
Reduce nutrient pollution by establishing comprehensive waste management systems to reduce discharges of harmful pollutants from wastewater treatment facilities, vessels, industrial sources, agricultural sources and air deposition.
Objective 2 : ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 61 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 8: Reduce Pollution ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Objective 3: Objective 4: Objective 5: Objective 6 : Objective 7: Reduce chemical pollution (e.g., oil, toxics, hazardous materials) from land - based sources and vessel discharges.
Reduce the flow of marine debris pollution from land - based sources and vessels, and remove existing marine debris from reef ecosystems .
Prevent and control the spread of invasive (e.g., non- native) species in coral reef ecosystems from ballast water and other mechanisms.
Develop tools to assess and address the impacts of pollutants on coral reefs.
Increase awareness and understanding of the ecological, health and socioeco nomic impacts of land - based and marine pollution on reef ecosystems.

The figure below is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal in addressing the impacts from these threats.
A higher ranking suggests that activities under this goal are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contributions, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.
The actual importance of this goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on location and other factors (see Tables 3 and 4 for regional comparisons).
Extreme Biotic Events Vessel Groundings Destructive Fishing Practices Coastal Pollution Global Warmin g/ Climate Change Sedimentation 
In spite of the longevity and apparent natural resilience of corals and the reefs they construct, both are extremely vulnerable to destruction by human activities either gradually through degraded habitat quality, or suddenly through catastrophic damage from vessel groundings, toxic spills, or habitat destruction.
Damaged coral reef communities recover slowly if at all particularly when the underlying habitat structure is destroyed, or when the prevailing environmental conditions have been chronically degraded over time.
In such cases, full recovery of pre- existing ecological communities, and the full range of services they provide, may require tens to hundreds o r thousands of years.
______________________________________________________________________ _______ 68 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Vessel Discharges Diseases L Goal 9: Restore Damaged Reefs ______________________________________________________________________ ________ While it is clearly preferable to prevent the loss of coral reef habitat through the kinds of proactive conservation measures presented in other sections of this s trategy, sometimes active restoration of coral reefs is needed to help prevent further degradation or possibly advance the natural restoration process in injured or damaged reef habitats.
Executive Order 13058 charges federal agencies with ensuring, to the extent permitted by law, that any actions they authorize, fund, or carry out will not degrade the conditions of coral reef ecosyste ms (with limited exceptions such as in time of war, or when necessary for reasons of national security).
Consequently, coral reef restoration is not usually considered a legitimate means to mitigate federal actions or projects that are expected to adversely impact reef habitats.
The goal of restoration efforts are to help repair damage caused by human impacts and natural disturbances, and restore the normal function, structure and diversity of coral reef ecosystems.
To that end, this restoration strategy describes avenues to strengthen restoration science and methods ranging from eliminating anthropogenic stressors that impede recovery, to more direct restoration of damaged habitats or depleted populations.
RESTORATION STRATEGY The goal of this s trategy is to increase the capability of federal and non- federal managers to efficiently and effectively restore injured or degraded coral reefs where appropriate.
The stra tegy is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Coastal Uses Working Group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more detailed information see http://coralreef.gov/ .
The s trategy includes research, monitoring, pilot studies and technology transfer outlined in six objectives to achieve this goal: Objective 1: Review and evaluate existing reef restoration projects to quantify the benefits gained by the effort and expenditure of the restoration, compared to scenarios in which no restoration efforts were undertaken, and make recommendations for improvements.
Develop and test innovative methods and techniques to expedite reef restoration for all major categories of coral reef injury, using a hypothesis- driven approach that involves rigorous, quantitative evaluation.
Develop regional restoration plans that identify significant restoration alternatives, and weigh the costs and benefits of natural recovery compared with restoration alternatives.
Promote cost- effective restoration projects on selected degraded U.S. reefs, focusing on habitats of high ecological, economic, and social or conservation value.
Objective 2: Objective 3: Objective 4: ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 69 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 9: Restore Damaged Reefs ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Objective 5: Objective 6: Rehabilitate degraded fish habitat through the deployment of artificial structures and rapid inexp ensive transplant methods, where appropriate.
Transfer proven restoration tools, techniques and lessons learned to domestic and international partners.
SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS (2001) Some p rogress has been made in the science and implementation of coral reef restoration, but much remains unknown and coral reef restoration remains a difficult process in many respects.
Progress has been made in the development and implementation of a range of new programs, in the support and training in effective response procedures following damage events, and in techniques for damage assessment and restoration activities to allow the reef sys tem to recover.
Restoration of reef systems can take tens to hundreds of years depending on the conditions.

______________________________________________________________________ _______ 73 National Coral Reef Action Strategy GOAL 10: IMPROVE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION KEY THREATS ADDRESSED: Improving outreach and education is critical to helping people understand the value of coral reef ecosystems and how to avoid damaging them.
Outreach and education are an essential part of fulfilling all the other goals in this strategy, and therefore address a number of key threats to coral reef ecosystems.
The figure below is a genera l summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal area (outreach and education) in addressing the impacts from these threats.
A higher ranking suggests that outreach and education activities are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contributions, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.
The actual importance of this goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on location and other factors (see Tables 3 and 4 for regional comparisons).
Destructive fishing practices Habitat destruction Vessel groundings Coastal pollution Sedimentation 
An informed, engaged public, including policy makers, industry representatives, non- governmental organizations, and other stakeholders, is fundamental to success fully achieving the goals of this strategy.
People will be more likely to alter their actions and support efforts to conserve coral reefs if they are knowledgeable about why coral reefs are important to their lives, understand how their actions affect the condition of the reef, and are aware of what individually and collectively can be done to contribute to coral reef protection.
______________________________________________________________________ _______ 74 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Vessel discharges Diseases Goal 10: Improve Outreach and Education ______________________________________________________________________ ________ By building on existing education efforts and working collaboratively, we can increase awareness of coral reef conservation issues and inform specific target audiences about how they can help protect coral reef ecosystems.
Education efforts will be most effective in addressing overfishing and destructive fishing practices, habitat destruction, coastal development and pollution, overuse from tourism, and vessel groundings.
An informed public will be more likely to understand the need for and abide by fis hing regulations.
Habitat destruction caused by unplanned coastal development, pollution, and sedimentation runoff may decrease as the public becomes informed of the implications of land - based actions on coral reef ecosystems and learn cost- effective ways to mitigate their impacts.
The millions of divers and snorkelers who visit coral reef ecosystems every year physically damage reefs in areas where their activities are heavily concentrated.
The tourism industry has realized the need to insure that visitors use natural resources responsibly and is looking for programs to raise awareness of this problem among divers and snorkelers.
Finally, hundreds of vessel groundings on coral reefs could be avoided if accurate marine maps were distributed to boaters educated in both boat operation and map reading.
OUTREACH AND EDUCATION STRATEGY The goal of this s trategy is to increase awareness and understanding of the ecological, cultural and socio- economic importance o f coral reef ecosystems among the widest possible audience.
The strategy is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the Outreach and Education working group o f the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more detailed information see http://coralreef.gov/ .
The strategy includes the following objectives to achieve the goal: Objective 1: Objective 2: Objective 3: Objective 4: Raise p ublic awareness and appreciation for coral reef ecosystems through targeted and focused communications campaigns.
Incorporate coral reef ecosystem issues in education programs to promote understanding of marine conservation.
Inform the public and policy- makers about accomplishments and recommendations of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
Increase understanding of coral reef ecosystems through conducting comprehensive assessments of monitoring and coral reef habitats.

Healthy marine ecosystems are crit ical to U.S. diplomatic and development strategies to promote economic and food security, social stability, democratic governance, improved human health, disaster and climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation in many countries.
Coral ree f ecosystems have great economic, social and cultural importance to many nations and entire regions.
These extremely valuable ecosystems constitute the economic ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 79 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Vessel Discharges Coastal Pollution Global Warming/ Climate Change Invasive Species Marine Debris Coastal Development Overfishing THREATS Diseases Goal 11: Reduce Threats To International Reefs ______________________________________________________________________ ________ base and future hope for sustained development in many countries, particularly small island Nations.
Coral reefs around the world are seriously threatened by direct and indirect human actions (Best et al 2002).
The 1998 Reefs at Risk study found that almost 60 percent of the world's coral reefs are potentially threatened by human activity - ranging from coastal development and destructive and over- fishing practices to overexploitation of resources, marine pollution, and land - based sources of pollution (Bryant et al 1998).
Runoff from inland deforestation, farming, sewage and municipal discharge decrease coastal water quality and increase sedimentation and excess nutrients on reefs.
Global surveys by Reef Check and other organizations have found that most reefs are severely over- fished, with most organisms of high commercial value missing.
In addition, the recent global impacts of catastrophic events, such as widespread coral bleaching and mortality and increased storm intensity, compound the more localized human impacts that place reefs at risk (Schuttenberg 2001).
Six billion people now inhabit our planet, twice as many as 40 years ago, and an additional 3 billion are expected in the next 40 years.
Population pressures are particularly acute in coastal areas.
Presently, almost half a billion people are estimated to live within 100 kilo meters of a coral reef, deriving great benefits from reef resources while placing increasing demands on these complex and fragile ecosystems that can no longer sustain such pressures.
STRATEGY TO REDUCE INTERNATIONAL THREATS The s trategy to achieve this goal is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the International working group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
To accomplish this goal, the U.S. Government will forge and support strategic partnerships with international organizations and conventions, the International Coral Reef Initiative, other governments, non- governmental groups, and the public and private sectors to address international threats and encourage broad stakeholder involvement.
Collaboration with our domestic and international partners will strive to conserve international coral reefs, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and global biodiversity, while sustaining the human communities that depend on them.
Development and technical assistance efforts will focus on building human and institutional capacity for integrated coastal management, marine park and protected area management, reduction of land - based sources of pollution, sustainable tourism, and sustainable fisheries in coral reef nations.
In many cases, these capacity- building efforts will provide the foundation for a governance system based upon the principles of transparent, participatory governance and ______________________________________________________________________ _______ 80 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 11: Reduce Threats To International Reefs ______________________________________________________________________ ________ adaptive management.
For more detailed information, see www.coralreef.gov.
The strategy includes six broad objective s to reduce threats to international reefs from human a ctivities: Objective 1: Objective 2: Objective 3: Exercise global leadership in the international arena in shaping and developing environmentally sound and comprehensive ocean and coral reef policy.
Build human and institutional capacity to manage and conserve reef ecosystems and coastal watersheds through integrated coastal management.
Promote efforts to prevent, reduce and control land - based sources of pollution and their effects on coral reef ecos ystems, including beaches, lagoons, sea grass beds, mangrove forests, shallow reefs, deep reefs and submerged bank reefs.
Support the creation and effective management of coral reef marine p rotected areas, particularly those that contain substantial ecological ( i.e. no- take) reserves.
Address the impact of global change, coral bleaching, and coral health on reefs and people.
Address unsustainable and destr uctive fishing practices and the U.S. role in and impact on international trade in coral reef species.

______________________________________________________________________ _______ 84 National Coral Reef Action Strategy GOAL 12: REDUCE IMPACTS FROM INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN CORAL REEF RESOURCES KEY THREATS ADDRESSED: Reducing impacts from international trade is important to reducing a number of key threats to coral reef ecosystems.
The figure below is a general summary of the relative importance (H = high, M = medium, L = low) of this goal in addressing the impacts from these threats.
A higher ranking suggests that activities under this goal are considered more important to addressing the threat.
Lower rankings suggest that although activities under this goal may make significant contributions, they may currently be less important to addressing the threat.
The rankings are a summary of input shown in Table 2.
The actual importance of this goal to addressing threats to reefs will depend on location and other factors (see Tables 3 and 4 for regional comparisons).
Destructive fishing practices Habitat destruction Vessel groundings Coastal pollution Hurricanes/ typhoons Extreme biologic events Global warming/ climate change Sediment- ton 
Some of this commercial collection involves destructive fishing practices, such as the use of poisons to capture live reef fish for aquaria and live fish markets.
In many cases, the local and regional intensity of collection appears to be occurring at unsustaina ble levels.
Surveys suggest that almost all reefs have been affected by over- collecting, and that there may be almost no pristine reefs left in the world (Hodgeson 1999).
______________________________________________________________________ _______ 85 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Vessel discharges Diseases Goal 12: Reduce Impacts From International Trade ______________________________________________________________________ ________ Unsustainable and destructive fishing practices are altering the ecosystem functions of reefs and greatly diminishing long- term benefits to local communities, who depend upon reef resources for food, livelihoods, coastal protection and cultural activities (Johannes and Riepen, 1995 ).
Unsafe diving practices associated with collection of some species for trade is also leading to a high incidence of illness, paralysis and death of collectors in some regions .
Executive Order 13089 on coral reef conservation charges the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force with analyzing and address ing the U.S. role in the international trade of coral reef species.
The Task Force International Working Group has taken a number of actions to fulfill this task (see http://coralreef.gov/ for Working Group reports).
A recent symposium on coral trade summarizes many of the findings to date (Best and Bornbusch 2001).
During the 1990's, the U.S. was consistently the world's largest importer of coral.
The U.S. imports 60- 80 percent of the live coral, over 50 percent of the curio coral, and 95 percent of the live rock and reef substrate in international trade each year, and the global trade is increasing annually by 10- 30 percent (Bruckner 2001).
In addition, the U.S. is estimated to import about 8 million of the 14- 30 million marine aquarium fishes in trade.
The aquarium trade includes over 1,000 species, with approximately two - thirds originating in the Indo- Pacific and a large proportion caught using cyanide.
Coral reef fishes are also being overexploited for the live reef food fish trade, which supplies Asian restaurant markets with groupers, large wrasses and other low productivity species that are particularly vulnerable to overfishing.
As the world's largest importer of ornamental coral reef species, the U.S. has a critical responsibility to address degradation of coral reef ecosystems that may arise from destructive collection practices and unsustainable trade.
The U.S. has banned the use of most dest ructive fishing practices, and collection of stony corals and live rock are prohibited in most federal, state and territorial waters.
However, many coral reef products and species continue to be imported into the U.S. that were captured using harmful e xtraction methods or were overexploited.
In the last several years, there have been efforts by the aquarium industry and non- governmental organizations to develop new procedures and guidelines for sustainable collection and transport of coral reef organis ms for the industry (e.g., Marine Aquarium Council Certification Program).
Furthermore, survivorship of animals from reef to consumer is often low due to stresses associated with cyanide fishing and poor handling and transport.
In light of the global decline in coral reef ecosystem health, and because of the prominent role of the U.S. as a consumer of coral reef species, it is in the national interest of the U.S. to e nsure the environmental sustainability of collection and trade as well as the long- term environmental and economic benefits to local communities dependent on coral reef ecosystems.
______________________________________________________________________ _______ 86 National Coral Reef Action Strategy Goal 12: Reduce Impacts From International Trade ______________________________________________________________________ ________ STRATEGY TO REDUCE IMPACTS O F GLOBAL TRADE The goal of this s trategy is to reduce the adverse impacts of collection and trade in coral reef animals, encourage more responsible trade, and encourage the conservation and management of coral reef ecosystems both domestically and internationally.
The strategy is outlined in the U.S. National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs and related documents of the International working group of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.
For more detailed information see http://coralreef.gov/.
The strategy includes two broad objectives to achieve the goal: Objective 1: Objective 2: Assess the nature and extent of the trade in coral reef species, and both positive and negative impacts associated with the trade.

Federal agencies provide funding for a wide variety of activities that directly, or indirectly, advance coral reef conservation.
Federal agencies were asked to provide information on their funding that directly supported coral reef conservation activities in fiscal years 1999- 2002.
The information provided by each agency for use in this report is shown in Tables 5 and 6.
Tables 5 and 6 only include funding directly related to coral reef conservation activities as determined by each agency, and do not include funding for activities indirectly related to coral reef conservation.
Note that these Tables will not include indirect support from federal agencies for activities related to coral reef conservation.
Table 5 shows estimates of federal funding directly related to coral reef conservation by each agency during fiscal years 1999- 2002.
The data suggest that from 1999- 2001, overall federal funding directly related to coral reef conservation activities increased by approximately $30 million to a total of $90 million.
Complete data were not available for 2002 from some agencies.
Table 6 shows estimates of federal funding for coral reef conservation by each of the 13 major goal areas of the strategy during fiscal years 1999- 2001 (values for 2002 were not available).
Table 6 allows comparison and tracking of funding levels for different goal areas over time.
Total funding increased in the period from 1999 to 2001, and funding increased for some goal areas more than others (e.g., mapping, monitoring, research, marine protected areas, reducing fishing impacts).
Funding for other goal areas remained about the same (e.g. understanding social/economic factors, reduce pollution, restoration, education/outreach, international activities, impacts of trade, improve coordination), or declined (reduce impacts of coastal uses ).

These activities take place in watersheds that outlet into estuaries linked to coral reef ecosystems or into waters where coral reefs are directly located.
**** The Department of Justice (DOJ) engages in actions in this area as part of the normal course of its work, but does not specifically allocate funds for coral reef habitats.
