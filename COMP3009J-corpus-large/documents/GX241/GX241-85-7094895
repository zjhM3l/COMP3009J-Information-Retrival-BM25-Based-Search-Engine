Governor Calls For Increased Efforts To Clean Chesapeake Bay ______________________________________________________________ Washington, D.C., OCTOBER 30, 1997 -- In remarks delivered at the annual Executive Council meeting of the Chesapeake Bay Program, Maryland Governor Parris N. Glendening today called for increased efforts to control nutrient pollution on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, warning that never before has the need to do more, and do it faster, been put in such sharp relief.
Referencing the outbreak of pfiesteria in Maryland and Virginia tributaries this summer, the Governor stated, we must recognize that our actions on land have resulted in a very unhealthy reaction in the water, and went on to describe the threat to human health, economic vitality and environmental well-being that excesses of phosphorus and nitrogen pose.
A new concept of Ecosystem Management on all state-owned lands.
This new policy will bring the most up-to-date environmental land management techniques, such as BayScapes, green building, and low-impact development to all state property.
.
Additionally, he cited actions taken after the outbreak of pfiesteria to demonstrate his commitment that We will do whatever is necessary to prevent toxic pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.
During the meeting, held this year at the Smithsonians Museum of Natural History, in Washington, D.C., the Executive Council of the Chesapeake Bay Program today voted to make Maryland Governor Parris N. Glendening leader of the regional Bay cleanup effort for the next twelve months.
Members of the Council, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge; Virginia Governor George Allen; EPA Administrator Carol Browner, the outgoing Chair; Chesapeake Bay Commission Chairman and Virginia legislator Tayloe Murphy; and Mayor Marion Barry, of the District of Columbia, unanimously agreed that Governor Glendening should take the Bay Program into its next phase, as the partnership faces the need for increased efforts to reduce nutrient loadings to the Bay.
One of the Governors underlying themes, which he cited as a critical component to the successful maintenance of the gains made by the restoration, was Ecosystem Management, and the link between non-point pollution, growth management and habitat restoration.
He called for the need to do evaluations of the capacity of a watershed to absorb growth.
He asked, How much load can a watershed take, how many tons of nitrogen or phosphorus can a river or stream absorb, before it crashes and becomes another victim of ignorance, indifference or greed? Without answers to questions like these, the Governor warned that we would not be able to sustain our progress or insure the long-term success of our efforts.
The Executive Council also reviewed the preliminary results of a year-long reevaluation, undertaken to measure the progress of the cleanup; signed three Council Directives; received the annual reports of three advisory committees to the Council; and recognized the contribution of noted researcher Dr. JoAnn Burkholder and physician Dr. Glen Morris for their work during the pfiesteria emergency in Maryland.
In summing up the meeting, Governor Glendening stated, I was gratified to learn that we have made such good progress in our efforts to keep nitrogen and phosphorus from entering our Bay and its tributaries.
He continued, But it is clear to see that there is much, much more that needs to be done.
The Governor outlined seven measures to augment the states basic cleanup blueprint, Marylands Tributary Strategies: 1.
Increased funding for Cover Crops -- this agricultural best management practice, where farmers plant fall grain crops in just-harvested fields, keeps nutrients from entering waterways during winter months.
2.
National action on nonpoint source pollution: +
Introducing the idea of a level playing field, for agriculture in Maryland, through implementation of national standards for nonpoint source discharges, so manufacturers or producers cant simply move to a another location where they can continue to pollute.
Pointing out that the success of the Clean Water Act of 1972 was significantly due to funding that fixed point sources of pollution.
The Governor suggested similar federal funding to control nonpoint sources of nitrogen and phosphorus is needed nationally.
3.
A three-point education initiative + First, a Youth Environmental Summit which will bring the high school leaders of tomorrow from all over Maryland together in May 1998 to discuss environmental issues and solutions from their own unique perspective.
+ Next, a Day on the Bay for every student in Maryland before they graduate from high school.
How can we expect school children to understand the need for strong action, personal responsibility and personal commitment, if the Bay isnt part of their lives? We need to insure every child in Maryland have a personal understanding of the Bays role in our culture, economy and their own life.
+
Finally, a Challenge Grant Fund for habitat restoration on school property, so the lessons taught about the Bay and the environment can be experienced first hand.
New water quality goals for the Bay cleanup established with the aid of the Bay Programss updated Water Quality model.
5.
A new ethic of personal responsibility and community stewardship based on the Resolution passed by the Chesapeake Bay Commission.
6.
Implementati on, and expansion, of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a federal/state cost sharing partnership that will mean many of new buffer and scores of acres of wetlands on agricultural fields and along streams.
A new concept of Ecosystem Management on all state-owned lands.
This new policy will bring the most up-to-date environmental land management techniques, such as BayScapes, green building, and low-impact development to all state property.
The three Directives, signed by the Executive Council members in a public ceremony, are aimed at increasing public and community participation in the cleanup; establishing a goal for wetlands restoration; and setting the stage for the next phase of the Bay restoration and what happens to the Bay beyond the year 2000.
