Tips on Dealing with SPAM ___________________________________________________ Virginia's New Anti-SPAM Statute Why is this law needed? Hardly a day goes by in which the news media do not report new examples of the use of computers and the Internet to commit fraud and economic crimes such as online auction fraud and identity theft.
Equally troublesome is the problem of "spam."
Unsolicited bulk e-mail, sometimes referred to as "spam" or "Unsolicited Commercial Electronic mail", is electronic mail which is unsolicited and sent for the purpose of selling the recipient goods, services, or properties.
Commercial Electronic mail advertisements are most often used for multi-level marketing schemes, get-rich-quick schemes, work-at-home schemes, questionable products or pornography.
Unsolicited e-mail from adult-oriented Web sites has increased 450 percent since June of 2001.
In fact, adult oriented spam comprises 8 percent of all unsolicited messages --- double the percentage from last year.
Not only does SPAM affect consumer and citizen email users but it can cripple businesses and Internet Service Providers.
Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore worked with the Virginia hi-tech community and Internet Service Providers as well as Delegate Jeannemarie Devolites and Senator Ken Stolle to draft and support the new Anti-Spam Legislation passed by the 2003 Virginia General Assembly.
This law is a first of its kind in the United States and is a comprehensive and leading effort to revise the Code of Virginia to address crimes committed via computers or computer networks involving spam and obscenity over the Internet.
What does this new law do? Back to Top
1.
Creates a new Anti-SPAM criminal section, รยง 18.2-152.3:1, that punishes the use of fraudulent means, such as forging headers or changing routing information to send SPAM.
If the sending of SPAM is accompanied by any of the following aggravating factors, the crime will be punishable as a Felony: * Volume of SPAM transmitted exceeds 10,000 in any 24 hour time period, 100,000 in any 30-day time period, or 1 million in any 1 year period;
* Revenue generated from specific SPAM exceeds $1,000, or total revenue generated from all SPAM transmitted to any ISP exceeds $50,000; or
* Where defendant knowingly hires, employs, uses or permits any minor to assist in the transmission of SPAM.
All other SPAM sent with fraudulent use of header or routing information, but without these factors is punishable as a Class 1 Misdemeanor.
2.
Creates a Forfeiture Provision for violations of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act so that any assets/proceeds earned by a Spammer as a result of a violation of the law may be seized and forfeited to the Commonwealth.
3.
Includes "Kingpin SPAMMERS" in the definition "use" of a computer or computer network to allow victims to "reach through" and get to the mastermind behind the spamming activity.
This affords law enforcement the ability to get "Kingpin SPAMMERS."
Kingpin SPAMMERS are those who fund the spamming operations by hiring others to transmit SPAM.
Formerly these Kingpin SPAMMERS could escape prosecution because they were not technically "using" the computer or computer network.
4.
Creates Protections for Privacy Rights of Consumers who complain about SPAM.
Spammers often threaten to depose or otherwise communicate with the complainants to question them about their Internet viewing habits and whether they asked to receive the messages.
5.
Enhances Penalties for Computer Crimes Involving Obscenity.
If a person uses a computer (including the illegal sending of SPAM sent by FRAUDULENT means) in connection with a violation of Virginia's obscenity laws, he is now subject to enhanced penalties.
Keep in mind that this is limited to obscenity.
Not all pornographic or adult-oriented email is obscene and will be punishable under this provision.
I think I may have received illegal SPAM, what should I do?
If the unsolicited bulk e-mail appears to use false headers or routing information or appears to be sent using fraudulent means, you should first inform your Internet Service Provider as the suspected SPAMMER may have violated the terms and conditions of your Internet Service Provider's usage policies.
Criminal SPAM and other computer crimes cases can be prosecuted by local law enforcement.
You should contact your local police department or Commonwealth Attorney's offices.
The Office of the Attorney General's Computer Crimes Unit may also be able to help you or your local law enforcement in the prosecution of a criminal case.
Keep in mind, the Virginia Computer Crimes Act also gives citizens a civil remedy and you can take the SPAMMER to court yourself.
Who investigates and prosecutes SPAM cases?
Local police, the state police, the Attorney General's Office Computer Crimes Unit and Federal Law Enforcement may all investigate and prosecute criminal SPAM cases where unsolicited bulk e-mail is sent using FRAUDULENT means.
Some of the larger Internet Service Providers have fraud and security departments who may conduct their own investigations and assist law enforcement.
What are the penalties? Back to Top
If the SPAM is sent with fraudulent header or routing information and is accompanied by one of the following aggravating factors then it is punishable as a Class 6 Felony.
A Class 6 Felony is punishable by a one to five year prison sentence and up to $2500 fine or both.
* Volume of SPAM transmitted exceeds 10,000 in any 24 hour time period, 100,000 in any 30-day time period, or 1 million in any 1 year period;
* Revenue generated from specific SPAM exceeds $1,000, or total revenue generated from all SPAM transmitted to any ISP exceeds $50,000; or
* Where defendant knowingly hires, employs, uses or permits any minor to assist in the transmission of SPAM.
All other SPAM sent with fraudulent use of heading or routing information, but without these aggravating factors is punishable as a Class 1 Misdemeanor.
A Class 1 Misdemeanor is punishable by up to twelve months in jail, a $2500 fine or both.
SPAM sent with fraudulent use of heading or routing information and containing obscene material is also punishable as a Class 1 Misdemeanor and for a second or subsequent offense it is punishable as a Class 6 Felony.

Tips on Dealing with SPAM
The mission of the Computer Crime Unit of the Office of the Attorney General is to spearhead Virginia's computer related criminal law enforcement in the twenty-first Century and to act as a clearinghouse for information concerning criminal and civil misuses of computers and the Internet.
This unit is part of the Technology Division of the Office of the Attorney General.
1.
NEVER RESPOND TO SPAM
They say they'll take your name off the list.
What they really want to do is confirm that they've got a live address.
Also, if you respond, they'll sell your address to every other spammer meaning you'll soon be flooded with even more spam.
2.
DON'T POST YOUR ADDRESS ON YOUR WEB SITE Back to Top
It seems like a good idea at the time, but posting your email address on your personal home page is just an invitation to spammers.
Spammers and the people who sell spamming as a business have software that "harvests" email addresses from the Net.
This software crawls through the Internet seeking text strings that are -something-@-something-.-something-.
When it finds one, it catalogs it on a database of other email addresses to be used to send spam.
3.
USE A SECOND EMAIL ADDRESS IN NEWS GROUPS
Newsgroups are the great email address gathering ground for spammers.
If you post to a group, you're going to get spam -- it is just a matter of time.
So how are you supposed to participate? Use a different email address than the one you use for talking to friends and relatives.
In other words, have a public address and a private address.
You'll just have to deal with the spam in your public account.
4.
DON'T GIVE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW IT WILL BE USED
If a website is asking for your email address, they want to use it for something.
Be sure you know what.
Read the terms of use and privacy statements of any site before telling them your address.
Ask yourself some simple questions.
Are they going to share or sell my address? Do I want emails from this website? Do I trust them? Is it worth the risk? If you can't answer these questions satisfactorily, if you can't find their privacy statement, don't tell them your address.
5.
USE A "SPAM" FILTER
While there is no such thing as a perfect filter, anti-spam software can help keep spam at manageable level.
Some of it is cumbersome, some works better than others, some even requires that you let your email messages go through another system for storage and cleaning.
But right now, that's the way it works.
6.
NEVER BUY ANYTHING ADVERTISED IN SPAM Back to Top
The reason that people spam is because they can make money.
They make money, like all advertisers, by convincing people to buy a product.
If no one buys the things advertised in spam, companies will quit paying spammers to advertise their products.
7.
ASK YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP) TO BLOCK ALL FUTURE EMAIL FROM THE SENDER
This is an important step that can help you and thousands of other subscribers.
Once an ISP has reason to believe their network is being used to send unlawful unsolicited commercial e-mail, they can block all further e-mail sent to its subscribers from the address or domain name of the sender.
