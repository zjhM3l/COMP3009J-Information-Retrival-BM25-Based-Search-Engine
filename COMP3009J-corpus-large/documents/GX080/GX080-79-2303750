TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ CHROMOSOMAL AND GENIC BARRIERS TO INTROGRESSION IN HELIANTHUS Author(s): RIESEBERG LOREN H LINDER C R SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary:
Cultivated sunflower had its origin from the wild annual species of sunflower.
Through evolutionary time and agronomic selection, the well recognized sunflower plant has evolved.
The use of classical breeding has resulted in the intercrossing of wild and cultivated sunflower.
Since may desirable agronomic and economic traits have been identified in the wild species, especially genes for disease resistance, the movement of these genes into cultivated sunflower has been by interspecific hybridization.
Following classical genetics, it has been assumed that the controlled crosses of wild and cultivated sunflower resulted in a mixture of the genomes from the two parents.
New molecular techniques now allow us to follow the genomes in these crosses and much to our surprise these interspecific crosses are not following the strict genetic rules.
There appears to be much less mixing of the two species than previously though, and less chromosomal rearrangements.
It has been hypothesize that the lack of rearrangement is a mechanism to preserve the species and a prevention mechanism from cross-breeding of the different species of wild sunflowers.
Armed with this knowledge and the development of newer techniques, in the future we should be able to pinpoint the desirable genes and trace their transfer from the wild species to the cultivated sunflower more efficiently.
