This microfilm publication reproduces five series of records received by the Secretary of the Treasury and filed in the "Alaska File" on fur sealing and salmon fishing.
The file includes letters from special agents for the protection of fur seals.
The Secretary of the Treasury was responsible for the duties and records relating to Alaskan fur sealing and salmon fisheries until July 1, 1903, when the functions were transferred to the newly created Department of Commerce and Labor.
The agents supervised the activities of the Alaska Commercial Co. and the North American Commercial Co., which from 1870-90 and 1890-1910, respectively, had leases to exclusive fur seal hunting rights on the Pribilof Islands.
The agents also oversaw the welfare of the Islands' Natives and enforced regulations on the traffic in firearms, ammunition, and liquor.
Letters received relative to salmon fishers, 1889-1903, include those relating to the problems of regulating the importation of liquor, ammunition, and firearms, and a few concerning the Metlakahtla Indians.

MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT RECORDS
The Army's primary responsibility in the West was the protection of white settlers against hostile Indians.
To do this, the Army frequently established camps and forts in hostile territory.
Army garrisons were often established close to Indian agencies.
The respective areas of authority of the agents and the Army commanders were often in dispute, and their viewpoints sometimes conflicted.
There was continual controversy over the respective merits of civilian and military control over the Indians, particularly during the 1870s, when there was a strong movement to transfer the Office of Indian Affairs back to the War Department.
RECORDS OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE, 1780'S-1917 (RECORD GROUP 94)
The Continental Congress on June 17, 1775, appointed an Adjutant General of the Continental Army.
After 1783 no further provision was made for such an officer until an act of March 5, 1792 (1 Stat. 241), provided for an adjutant, who was also to do the work of inspector.
The Adjutant General is charged with matters relating to command, discipline, and administration of the military establishment, and has the duties of recording, authenticating, and communicating the Secretary's orders, instructions, and regulations to troops and individuals in the Army.
He is also responsible for issuing commissions, compiling and issuing the Army Register and the Army List and Directory, consolidating the general returns of the Army and militia, and recruiting.
The Adjutant General's Office chiefly handles Army orders, correspondence, and other records, and it receives final custody of virtually all records concerned with the military establishment, including personnel of the Army and discontinued commands, noncurrent holdings of bureaus of the War Department, and special collections.

Reports and Correspondence Relating to the Army Investigations of the Battle at Wounded Knee and to the Sioux Campaign of 1890-1891.

The Battle at Wounded Knee Creek, South Dakota, took place on December 29, 1890.
A band of Sioux Indians in the custody of the 7th U.S. Cavalry was being disarmed when a fight broke out, resulting in numerous white and Indian casualties.
Many of the Sioux casualties were women and children.
Beyond these basic facts, the course of events at Wounded Knee and the ultimate responsibility for them have always been subjects for debate.
The investigative reports and accompanying papers included in this microfilm publication record much of the earliest phase of that debate.
They represent efforts of the Army to determine the circumstances surrounding the events at Wounded Knee and any possible misconduct on the part of the 7th Cavalry.

The microfilm contains some of the earliest territorial material relating to American Indians held by NARA.
The manuscripts (arranged in 101 consecutively numbered envelopes, or manuscript files) consist of about 500 documents that relate primarily to the pay and supply of state militia organizations mustered into federal service from the close of the American Revolution until the War of 1812.
