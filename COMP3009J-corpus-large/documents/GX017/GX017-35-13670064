Return to list of News Releases News Release: For Immediate Release May 16, 2002 _________________________________________________________________ Department of Fish and Game Reminds Californians that Statewide Coyote Awareness is Needed as Encounters with Humans Are on the Rise _________________________________________________________________ Contacts: Doug Updike, Senior Wildlife Biologist, (916) 445-3652 Steve Martarano, DFG Conservation Education Office, (916) 654-5866 _________________________________________________________________ SACRAMENTO -- Whether it's at a retirement development in Laguna Beach, an elementary school in San Clemente, or a suburban park in Orangevale, human mistakes are resulting in the increase of coyote encounters in California.
The Department of Fish and Game (DFG), while recognizing the benefits of observing and enjoying all wildlife in their native habitat, reminds residents that coyote encounters with humans can be reduced if coyotes remain cautious of people.
"While aggressive displays toward people are not considered normal coyote behavior, it is important to note that coyotes will become comfortable around humans if we let them," said Doug Updike, senior wildlife biologist for DFG.
"We can minimize potential conflicts by being mindful of our own actions."
The coyote (Canis latrans) is native to California.
It closely resembles a small German shepherd dog with the exception of the long snout and bushy, black-tipped tail.
The coyote's high-pitched, yodel-like yapping can frequently be heard at night.
They are extremely adaptable and resourceful (hence the term "wily coyote") and can survive on whatever food is available.
They prey on rabbits, mice, birds and other small animals, as well as young deer and sheep.
In urban areas, coyotes often attack people's small pets - cats and dogs included - and have been known to attack small children as well.
"
Problems occur when people feed coyotes - either deliberately or inadvertently,"
Updike said.
"Coyotes will quickly lose their natural aversion to people and become bold and aggressive."
To avoid problems with coyotes, people should follow these guidelines: *
Never feed a coyote - Deliberately feeding coyotes puts pets and other residents in the neighborhood at risk and it's against the law to feed coyotes or other wildlife.
Also, people can inadvertently feed coyotes by leaving pet food or garbage where they can get it.
Feed pets indoors or promptly remove outdoor dishes, bring bird feeders in at night, store bags of pet food indoors, and use trash cans with lids that clamp shut.
Clear brush and dense weeds from around dwellings - Reduce protective cover for coyotes and make the area less attractive to rodents.
Coyotes, as well as other predators, may be attracted to areas where rodents are concentrated, such as wood piles and seed storage areas.
Protect children - Although rare, coyotes have been known to attack and seriously injure young children.
Never leave small children unattended in areas known to be frequented by coyotes, even in familiar surroundings, such as a backyard.
Protect pets and livestock - Keep small pets such as cats, rabbits, and small dogs indoors, especially at night.
They are easy, favored prey.
Coyotes have been known to be responsible for a large number of cat disappearances in a single residential neighborhood.
Use negative reinforcement - If coyotes are present, make sure they know they're not welcome.
Make loud noises, throw rocks, or spray them with a garden hose.
To keep coyotes wild or to prevent a coyote from becoming habituated to humans, it is important that coyotes retain their natural wariness of humans.
If a coyote is observed acting aggressively or attacking people, immediately contact the nearest DFG office.
After normal business hours (Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.), contact the DFG's 24-hour dispatch center at (916) 445-0045.
While there seems to have been an increase in reported aggressive coyote behavior throughout the state (DFG has investigated 17 attacks on humans, eight resulting in injuries in DFG's South Coast region alone the past year), it is important to note this is not typical coyote behavior and the large number of incidents may not be a reoccurring pattern.
Updike cited two possibilities for the recent unusual behavior, including an increasing number of residential areas encroaching on coyote habitat, resulting in more people contacts; and ongoing drought conditions, particularly in southern California, which reduces the animal's "prey base" of rabbits and rodents.
