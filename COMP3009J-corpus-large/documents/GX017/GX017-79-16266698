NINDS Guide for Investigators Planning to Work with Human Embryonic Stem Cells
The NIH is implementing a policy permitting Federal funding of research on existing human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that meet the President's guidelines.
Research using cell lines from the NIH human ES cell registry (http://escr.nih.gov) may begin on December 7, 2001.
Information on human ES cell research is posted on the NIH website as well as on an NINDS Stem Cell website (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/stemcells); the NINDS contact is listed below.
All NINDS-supported investigators proposing human ES cell research should consider the following steps: * Contact your NINDS program officer for current information regarding research using human ES cells.
* Identify cell line(s) and provider(s) on the NIH Registry.
* Contact the provider.
Providers may request a brief abstract of proposed research.
The provider's material transfer requirements will vary and some providers will be interested in establishing collaborative research projects.
* Contact your institution's technology transfer office regarding the material transfer agreement.
* (MTA) or memorandum of understanding (MOU) including intellectual property issues and the mechanism of payment.
* Federal Government Clearances for Receipt of International Shipment of Human Embryonic Stem Cells. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-013.html
* ES cells are difficult to culture.
Specific training or prior human ES cell culture techniques will probably be required from the cell line provider or another laboratory with experience.
* If the source of the cell line is international, additional permits from the USDA and CDC are required and the link to this information is listed at the NINDS website.
While acquiring human ES cells, investigators can submit a new, competing application, a competing renewal, or a competing supplement to fund research on human ES cells.
Grantees who wish to submit requests to re-budget existing funds or for administrative supplements may submit their requests if the cell line to be used is on the registry and if the proposed work is within the scope of the grant.
Contact your NINDS program officer indicating the human ES cell line(s) selected from the registry and for information regarding re-budgeting or on administrative supplements.
