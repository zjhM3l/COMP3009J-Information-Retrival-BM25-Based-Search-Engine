Definitions
Q.
The Notice of Funds Available and application both state that "Reuse is defined as using a material over again in its current form without any significant processing that alters its materials structure."
What is the definition of "altering" in this statement (e.g., chemically)? Our city would like to utilize the Reuse Assistance Grant to purchase mulching mowers to reuse grass clippings.
A.
For the purpose of the Reuse Assistance Grants, "altering" is defined as changing the form of a material to the extent that the material is not capable of being used again for its original purpose.
This includes, but is not limited to, chemical alteration, composting, recycling, grinding, milling, transformation, etc.
As such, purchasing mulching mowers to reuse grass clipping would be considered an ineligible project.
Q.
I have a question regarding the definition of reuse.
Our nonprofit organization is looking to partner with our City on a project to encourage plastic bag reuse.
The project would entail enlisting community volunteers to crochet plastic bags into usable shopping bags, which would then be redistributed/sold for use in markets.
Additional components would be public outreach education on the environmental dangers posed by excess plastic use, through presentations at community centers, developing informational brochures for consumers, and Public Service Announcements to encourage reusing plastic bags.
As crocheting the bags requires cutting them into strips, does this still fit within the confines of reuse? The cutting will not alter the plastic's material structure; however, it would alter the bags' shape.
I was also wondering more generally if this project ideareusing plastic bagsfits in with the overall criteria, as it seems that larger items such as lumber and electronic appliances are considered preference materials.
A. As described, such a project could be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.

Eligible/Ineligible Applicants
Q.
Are schools and school districts eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. Schools and school districts are eligible to partner with a local public agency (e.g., a city, county, or regional agency that has obligations to implement and develop waste reduction programs pursuant to the requirements set forth in Public Resources Code Â§ 400504 et seq.) for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
The local public agency will be the applicant for the grant, and therefore, if awarded the grant, will be (1) responsible for administering the grant; (2) responsible for disbursing grant funds; and, (3) accountable for how the grant funds are expended.
Q.
Is a project that has been funded from a previous offering of Reuse Assistance Grants eligible for this offering, or is there a restriction of one grant per project?
A. Receipt of a previous Reuse Assistance Grant award(s) from the California Integrated Waste Management Board will not affect an applicant's eligibility.
To remain competitive, the applicant would need to show how these grant funds would complement the previous grant award by expanding the previous project or encompassing a new component.
Q.
I understand that to remain competitive, a previous recipient of a Reuse Assistance Grant award(s) from the California Integrated Waste Management Board who desires to apply for this offering of Reuse Assistance Grants would need to show how these grant funds would complement the previous grant award by expanding the previous project or encompassing a new component.
By "expanding" their previous project, does this mean that they would have to expand their floor space, etc., or does it mean that they could make more efficient use of their current space, etc.?
A. Receipt of a previous grant award(s) from the California Integrated Waste Management Board will not affect an applicant's eligibility.
To remain competitive, the applicant would need to show how these grant funds would complement the previous grant award by expanding (not necessarily physically) the previous project or encompassing a new component.
Q.
If I am a business, do I need to find an agency with which to partner?
A. Nonlocal public agencies (e.g., businesses, nonprofits, etc.) must find a local public agency with which to partner.
Q.
It appears that the Reuse Assistance Grants are available only to municipalities or governments, and we are a private business.
We would like to apply for a grant to increase our wood recycling activities and begin to create landscape mulch.
Are we eligible?
A. Private businesses may partner with a local public agency to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant (with the local public agency as the applicant).
However, only reuse projects are eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grantrecycling projects are ineligible.
Q.
It appears that the Reuse Assistance Grants would require an industrial or commercial zone or development.
Since we have only residential zones in our community, would the Reuse Assistance Grants apply to our community?
A.
The Reuse Assistance Grants are available to all California local public agencies, regardless of how the community is zoned.
Q.
We would like to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant for a project that will be receiving $2,500 from the California Integrated Waste Management Board.
Does this disqualify us from applying for a Reuse Assistance Grant because we are already receiving funds to run a portion of the program?
A. Receiving funds from the California Integrated Waste Management Board or another source for a project would not be a disqualifying factor, provided that the California Integrated Waste Management Board funds are not intended to serve as the matching contribution requirement.
As stated on page 6 of the application, matching contributions may not come from other Board grants, loans, or contracts.
Q.
Is Marin Municipal Water District an eligible agency?
A.
If Marin Municipal Water District falls within the definition of a local public agency (e.g., a city, county, or regional agency that has obligations to implement and develop waste reduction programs pursuant to the requirements set forth in Public Resources Code Â§ 400504-et seq.), then they would be eligible to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
If you are uncertain, check with your legal counsel.
Q.
Could you please list specific municipal programs (and refer to their corresponding PARIS code) that this Reuse Assistance Grant does fund? It will help with justifying to City Council to allocate time and money to the grant process.
A.
A list of the Recycling Coordinators for California cities and counties is available on the Department of Conservation's Web site at http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dor/grants/index.htm.
This list is updated at the beginning of each month, and may be useful in soliciting a partnership with a local public agency.
Information regarding agencies' PARIS codes may be found at www.ciwmb.ca.gov/LGCentral/PARIS/.

Eligible/Ineligible Projects
Q.
Would repairing or refurbishing computer monitors (Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs)) be considered an eligible project?
A. Grant funds and the matching contribution may not be expended on activities related to the management of hazardous materials.
A recent clarification by the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) confirmed that discarded CRTs are considered a hazardous waste which may be managed as a Universal Waste.
(Please see the DTSC fact sheets for more information on this designation.)
In light of this, grant funds may not be used for the repair or refurbishment of CRTs.
Electronic products are, however, a preferred material type for this grant offering.
It is recognized that projects intended to manage electronic products, such as computer CPUs, for reuse will likely encounter CRTs in the course of operation.
If the project proponent wishes to handle, repair, or refurbish CRTs as a component of their project, the Board encourages the applicant to secure necessary funding, such as corporate or business sponsorship, separate from Reuse Assistance Grant funds, recognizing that this would not be eligible as a matching contribution.
Q.
Would the removal of a community hospital laboratory counters and cabinets for reuse qualify for a Reuse Assistance Grant? We received a bid for approximately $20,000 to disconnect electrical, gas, and plumbing for nine high quality laboratory counters and cabinets, and are hoping for removal in the spring of 2003.
A. As described, the removal and reuse of a community hospital laboratory counters and cabinets could be considered an eligible project for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
It is anticipated that the grants will be awarded in the spring of 2003 and grant recipients will start their projects around May 2003.
Q.
While the Reuse Assistance Grant application states only nonhazardous materials may be considered eligible materials for reuse, could an exception be made for tires recycled into rubberized concrete?
A. Recycling tires into rubberized concrete would be considered significantly processing the tires, and therefore would not be considered reuse.
Subsequently, such a project would be considered ineligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
Back to Top
Q.
Would a program set up for the continuous collection of edible foods not sold at restaurants, to then be donated to a nonprofit for redistribution for those in need, be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, it would seem that such a project could be eligible.
Information on a Reuse Assistance Grant project recently funded in Los Angeles County involving food rescue is available at: www.ciwmb.ca.gov/reuse/grants/LGAssist/2ndCycle/Recipients.htm#Lomit a.
Q.
Are examples available of what cities have proposed for past Reuse Assistance Grant offerings, and what would be eligible under this current offering?
A. Yes, information on past grant projects that have been funded may be found at www.ciwmb.ca.gov/reuse/grants/LGAssist/Archives.htm.
Q.
As advised, I looked at the food rescue project that was funded with previous Reuse Assistance Grant funds (www.ciwmb.ca.gov/reuse/grants/LGAssist/2ndCycle/Recipients.htm#Lomita) and have read through the eligible section of the grant application.
We (the City) are considering partnering with a local grocery store to take their food that they are not going to sell, remove the food from the shelves, and redistribute the food to the homeless, etc. via a partnership with a nonprofit organization that is already doing some of this.
Would food not sold from a grocery store qualify for donation and redistribution? Could the value of that donation also count as part of the matching section of the grant?
A. As described, donating and redistributing food not sold from grocery stores, restaurants, etc. could be considered an eligible project for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
The value of the material targeted for reuse through the project may not be considered an eligible contribution towards the project.
Therefore, the value of the food donation would not be eligible as the matching contribution requirement.
Additionally, as stated on page 6 of the application, "'in-kind' contributions, with the exception of staff time, are ineligible".
Q.
I understand that to remain competitive, a previous recipient of a Reuse Assistance Grant award(s) from the California Integrated Waste Management Board who desires to apply for this offering of Reuse Assistance Grants would need to show how these grant funds would complement the previous grant award by expanding the previous project or encompassing a new component.
By "expanding" their previous project, does this mean that they would have to expand their floor space, etc., or does it mean that they could make more efficient use of their current space, etc.?
A. Receipt of a previous grant award(s) from the California Integrated Waste Management Board will not affect an applicant's eligibility.
To remain competitive, the applicant would need to show how these grant funds would complement the previous grant award by expanding (not necessarily physically) the previous project or encompassing a new component.
Q.
Can Reuse Assistance Grant funds be used to divert for reuse paint delivered to a Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) collection center?
A. Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to help finance the establishment of programs and processes that reuse non-hazardous materials.
In California, paint (including latex paint) is considered a hazardous material.
As such, activities that collect and prepare discarded paint for reutilization would not be considered an eligible project or eligible portion of a larger project.
Please see the California Integrated Waste Management Board's fact sheet on latex paint for additional information on the hazards associated with this material: www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Publications/default.asp?pubid=602.
Back to Top
Q.
I understand that the refurbishment of Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) is not an eligible project, because it is considered the management of hazardous (universal) waste.
Is the packaging and distribution of useable latex paint considered an eligible project, or is latex paint considered hazardous, as well? No treatment of the paint will take place.
A. Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to help finance the establishment of programs and processes that reuse non-hazardous materials.
In California, paint (including latex paint) is considered a hazardous material.
As such, activities that collect and prepare discarded paint for reutilization would not be considered an eligible project or eligible portion of a larger project.
Please see the California Integrated Waste Management Board's fact sheet on latex paint for additional information on the hazards associated with this material: www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Publications/default.asp?pubid=602.
Q.
I understand that Reuse Assistance Grant funds cannot be used for hazardous materials, including Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) computer monitors.
Can Reuse Assistance Grant funds be used in connection with a E-waste round-up to separate out working CPUs for reuse, with non-functional units going directly into the separately-funded E-waste recycling project?
A. Reuse Assistance Grant funds and the matching contribution may not be expended on activities related to the management of hazardous materials.
A recent clarification by the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) confirmed that discarded Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) are considered a hazardous waste which may be managed as a Universal Waste.
(Please see the DTSC fact sheets (www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/CRTs/index.html) for more information on this designation.)
In light of this, grant funds may not be used for the repair or refurbishment of CRTs.
Electronic products are, however, a preferred material type for this grant offering.
It is recognized that projects intended to manage electronic products, such as computer CPUs, for reuse will likely encounter CRTs in the course of operation.
If the project proponent wishes to handle, repair, or refurbish CRTs as a component of their project, the Board encourages the applicant to secure necessary funding, such as corporate or business sponsorship, separate from Reuse Assistance Grant funds, recognizing that this would not be eligible as a matching contribution.
Q.
Would taking discarded cell phones and having them reprogrammed to 911 for frail and elderly populations be considered an eligible project for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A.
The Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to fund projects that reuse non-hazardous materials.
Concerns have been raised about the potential toxicity of certain electronic components in cellular phones and other consumer devices; however, it has not yet been determined whether cellular phones as a whole exhibit the characteristics to be considered a hazardous material.
As such, the project as described could be considered an eligible project until it is determined that cellular phones are a hazardous material.
Please note that the greater amount of material that will be reused through the project, the more competitive the proposal will be ranked with other proposals.
Q.
Would a project that takes used tires and converts them into another product with minimal processing be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, the project would not qualify for a Reuse Assistance Grants as the tires would be significantly altered in order to be converted into a new product, and thus would not fall under the Reuse Assistance Grants' narrow definition of reuse.
This is similar in concept to cutting salvaged logs into dimensional lumber; another worthy yet unfortunately ineligible project.
For possible funding for tire-related products, visit the Board's Web site at www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Tires/Grants/Technology/.

Q.
Our company generates several tons per month of scrap rubber from our molding operation.
This scrap is made of 100 percent California derived tire crumb rubber.
Would reusing the material as rubberized asphalt be considered an eligible project for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, the project would not qualify for a Reuse Assistance Grants as the crumb rubber would be significantly processed in order to be converted into rubberized asphalt, and thus would not fall under the Reuse Assistance Grants' narrow definition of reuse.
For possible grant funding opportunities for tire-related products, visit the California Integrated Waste Management Board's Web site at www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Tires/Grants/Technology/ and www.ciwmb.ca.gov/GreenBuilding/Grants/.
Q.
Would a project that constructs a playground that is made entirely of recycled materials, for example, tires, be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, the project would not be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant, as the project is proposing to use recycled materials, rather than reused materials for the construction of a playground.
However, there are a variety of Waste Tire Recycling Grants offered by the California Integrated Waste Management Board that may fund such a project.
These grant offerings can be found at www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Grants/.
Q.
We (the County) are planning on taking fiberglass waste, which is currently being landfilled, grinding it and blending it with a road base material made of ground up asphalt roofing shingles.
This blended product is then used by Hot Mix Asphalt Plants to repair roads.
The waste fiberglass is generated by various local asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers and we have about 2000 tons currently being disposed at local landfills.
Does this fall under the definition of Reuse C
A. As described, the project would not be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant, as the material intended for reuse must be reused in its current form, not recycled.
As stated on page 4 of the application, recycling projects are not eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
Q.
Would collecting food and composting it to create worm castings be considered an eligible project for a Reuse Assistance Grant, or must the food be used only for human consumption? Additionally, would diverting food for use as animal feed be considered an eligible project?
A. Composting projects are not considered eligible projects for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
The Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to foster projects that take a material in its current form and reuse it in that form without any significant processing that would alter its material structure.
A project that recovers food for timely human consumption could be considered an eligible project.
However, a project that recovers food for ultimate use as animal feed would not be considered an eligible project due to the degree of processing that is required by Department of Food and Agriculture regulations.
These requirements (namely re-cooking to ensure feed safety) would be considered significant processing of the material and would not fit within the narrow definition of reuse that is applied to projects eligible through this grant offering.
Q.
Can funding be used to construct a building that is specifically for our waste reduction program? A. Reuse Assistance Grant funds may be used to construct a building that will be used solely for reuse (not recycling) operations.
Q.
Our city is partnering with a private enterprise that reuses textiles (mainly clothing) by providing them to thrift stores.
The business is considering expanding the reuse program to include toys, furniture, and other items.
The program will help thrift stores to lower operating costs and save disposal space at the landfill.
Would this be considered an eligible project?
A. As described, this project could be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
Back to Top
Q.
Can the Reuse Assistance Grants be used to purchase and install a system to substitute a reusable product for a throwaway? For example, to purchase dishes and install a dishwasher for a school that now uses throwaways daily? Or, could the Reuse Assistance Grants be used for a business to substitute reusable packaging for throwaway packaging?
A. As described, purchasing dishes and installing a dishwasher for a school that currently uses disposable products daily, or purchasing reusable packaging to substitute disposable packaging could be considered eligible projects, since they propose to reduce waste through the implementation of a system that practices reuse in its operation and would ultimately reduce the generation of solid waste via reuse.
However, it would need to be demonstrated how the successful operations of the system/project put in place to replace disposables with reusables/durables would remain under the control of the project proponent.
Please note that the primary purpose of this grant offering is to encourage the establishment of systems, infrastructure, programs and/or facilities that recover materials for reuse that are otherwise destined for disposal.
All proposals will be competitively evaluated and scored accordingly to the approved scoring criteria within the application.
Q.
It appears that the Reuse Assistance Grants are available only to municipalities or governments, and we are a private business.
We would like to apply for a grant to increase our wood recycling activities and begin to create landscape mulch.
Are we eligible?
A. Private businesses may partner with a local public agency to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant (with the local public agency as the applicant).
However, only reuse projects are eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grantrecycling projects are ineligible.
Q.
Would the cost of producing a marketing piece for a thrift store (or group of thrift stores) qualify for a Reuse Assistance Grant? By encouraging thrift store purchases we will be encouraging the reuse of many household items.
A. As described, a marketing piece for a thrift store (or group of thrift stores) could be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
However, please note that as this is a competitive grant, all proposed projects will be scored on several criteria including "Need," which is worth 30 points of the total 100 points available for this application, and "Objectives," which is worth 25 points of the total 100 points available for this application (see page 7 of the application).
The definition of "Need" for this grant offering includes the "(d)escription and justification of any targeting of specific commercial sectors based on the potential for waste diversion through reuse."
The definition of "Objectives" for this grant offering includes "(t)he extent to which benefits from the project will continue after the funding has ended."
Proposed projects that accomplish the goal of targeting business sectors and projects that have a propensity for longevity will receive higher "Need" and "Objectives" scores than those that do not.
The California Integrated Waste Management Board cannot predetermine whether a particular proposed project will receive the score necessary to qualify for funding.
Q.
Can these grants be used to facilitate deconstruction activities? We want to deconstruct two buildings at our ski resort to maximize the amount of materials salvaged.
A. As described, the Reuse Assistance Grants could be used to facilitate deconstruction activities provided that the material deconstructed is intended for reuse as defined in the application.
Q.
Would crushing sheet rock be considered processing or too much processing to fall under the definition of reuse and be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant? We are considering a project that uses crushed sheetrock as a soil amendment and would need funds to increase our ability to handle more materials at reduced costs.
A. Crushing sheet rock for use as soil amendment would be considered significantly processing the material, and therefore, would not be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
Q.
Would a food waste diversion project, which produces worm castings as the end product be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, no.
Producing worm castings from composted food would be considered significant processing of the material and would not fit within the narrow definition of reuse that is applied to projects eligible through this grant offering.
For this Reuse Assistance Grant, reuse is defined on page 4 of the application.
Back to Top
Q.
Would a project that diverts drywall for use as a soil amendment be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, no.
Using decomposed drywall as a soil amendment would be considered significantly processing of the drywall and would not fit within the narrow definition of reuse that is applied to projects eligible through this grant offering.
For this Reuse Assistance Grant offering, reuse is defined on page 4 of the application.
Q.
Would a project that takes glass frit and tailings from glass making operations and uses a new burner and molds to make another product from the frit and tailings be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, no.
Using the glass frit and tailings to make another product would be considered significantly processing the material, and therefore, would be considered a recycling project.
Recycling projects are not eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant, as stated on page 4 of the application.
Q.
Our city would like to partner with a company that sells us composters (made of recycled plastic) at cost.
We then partner with the city's Farmers Market and sell them at cost.
Would such a project qualify?
A. As described, such a project would not be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant because composting projects are ineligible projects, even though recycled composters are proposed to be used.
The Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to foster projects that take a material in its current form and reuse it in that form without any significant processing that would alter its material structure.
Q.
My city is interested in a "Clean-up Day" type activity, where reusable items are exchanged or sold by community members to others in the area.
We anticipate that the "Clean-up Day" activity would involve either one city, or a group of cities that rotates the programs through their city.
Would this type of project be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, this project could be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
Please refer to the application for information on priority material types and preference criteria against which such a proposed project will be evaluated.
Q.
Our city has an ordinance about using only rechargeable batteries, and we would like to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant to have the ordinance get through and require the entire city to use only rechargeable batteries.
We realize that batteries are a universal waste; however, reusing batteries would be eliminating waste.
Would such a project be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to help finance the establishment of programs and processes that reuse non-hazardous materials.
In California, batteries are considered a hazardous material.
As such, activities that focus on batteries (whether rechargeable or disposable) would not be considered an eligible project or eligible portion of a larger project.

Q.
We recently redecorated our entire Administration Building and Learning City at our MRF.
We have many chairs that are structurally good, but the tendency is to get rid of them and get new ones.
I wanted to have them reupholstered, giving a local person business and making it known through signs in the Learning Center, etc. that we reupholstered our chairs rather than buying new ones.
Would such a project be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As described, such a project could be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
However, please note all proposals will be competitively evaluated and scored accordingly to the approved scoring criteria within the application.
Additionally, note that as this is a competitive grant, all proposed projects will be scored on several criteria including "Need," which is worth 30 points of the total 100 points available for this application, and "Objectives," which is worth 25 points of the total 100 points available for this application (see page 7 of the application).
The definition of "Need" for this grant offering includes the "(d)escription and justification of any targeting of specific commercial sectors based on the potential for waste diversion through reuse."
The definition of "Objectives" for this grant offering includes "(t)he extent to which benefits from the project will continue after the funding has ended."
Proposed projects that accomplish the goal of targeting business sectors and projects that have a propensity for longevity will receive higher "Need" and "Objectives" scores than those that do not.

The Notice of Funds Available and application both state that "Reuse is defined as using a material over again in its current form without any significant processing that alters its materials structure."
What is the definition of "altering" in this statement (e.g., chemically)? Our city would like to utilize the Reuse Assistance Grant to purchase mulching mowers to reuse grass clippings.
A.
For the purpose of the Reuse Assistance Grants, "altering" is defined as changing the form of a material to the extent that the material is not capable of being used again for its original purpose.
This includes, but is not limited to, chemical alteration, composting, recycling, grinding, milling, transformation, etc.
As such, purchasing mulching mowers to reuse grass clipping would be considered an ineligible project.
Q.
The City has a tool lending library, which makes a variety of hand and power tools available to city residents.
This ranges from simple shovels and ladders to lawnmowers, power saws, and cement mixers.
The library would like to: 1) Purchase more/better tools; 2) Publicize this resource; 3) Write (with the help of a graduate student in economics) a manual to help other cities set up a tool lending library; and 4) Possibly sponsor training in repairing items that would otherwise be discarded and replaced.
Would any of these projects be eligible for grant funding? We recognize that the tool lending library promotes source reduction because it allows people to share tools rather than buy their own and that reuse is a subset of source reduction.
A. 1) As described, purchasing more/better tools would not be considered an eligible project because while a lending library is reusing the tools, the tools are not materials that are normally discarded.
Additionally, the Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to fund projects that reuse materials normally destined for disposal, not to purchase new or additional materials (e.g., tools) for the project.
A. 2) As described, publicizing the tool lending library would not be considered an eligible project as the tools are not materials that are normally discarded.
A. 3) Consequently, writing a manual to help other cities establish a tool lending library would not be considered an eligible project.
A. 4) As described, it would seem that sponsoring training in repairing items that would otherwise be discarded and replaced could be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.

The definition of "Objectives" for this grant offering includes "(t)he extent to which benefits from the project will continue after the funding has ended."
Also note that the primary purpose of the Reuse Assistance Grant Offering is to establish and/or enhance local reuse infrastructure.
As such, the primary focus of any project proposal should be on the benefits to be realized at the local level; however, any ancillary benefits to an existing statewide program would not be considered a negative aspect.
Q.
Our Parks 
It would involve not only the purchase of the mulcher, but an entire reuse program for this item.
Would this be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
A. As described, such a project would not be eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant because mulching and composting projects are ineligible projects.
The Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to foster projects that take a material in its current form and reuse it in that form without any significant processing that would alter its material structure.
Q.
I have a question regarding the definition of reuse.
Our nonprofit organization is looking to partner with our City on a project to encourage plastic bag reuse.
The project would entail enlisting community volunteers to crochet plastic bags into usable shopping bags, which would then be redistributed/sold for use in markets.
Additional components would be public outreach education on the environmental dangers posed by excess plastic use, through presentations at community centers, developing informational brochures for consumers, and Public Service Announcements to encourage reusing plastic bags.
As crocheting the bags requires cutting them into strips, does this still fit within the confines of reuse? The cutting will not alter the plastic's material structure; however, it would alter the bags' shape.
I was also wondering more generally if this project ideareusing plastic bagsfits in with the overall criteria, as it seems that larger items such as lumber and electronic appliances are considered preference materials.
A. As described, such a project could be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
Q.
Our water filtering process yields quantities of sludge.
Our construction activities yield quantities of soil, asphalt, cement, pipe, etc.
May a Reuse Assistance Grant be used for the purpose of performing a study and developing a plan for reuse of these materials?
A. Feasibility studies are not eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant, as the Reuse Assistance Grants are intended for the establishment or expansion of tangible reuse programs.
Q.
We would like to use a Reuse Assistance Grant for our Recycling Market Development Zone (RMDZ) program.
Is this something that could be funded, or would it not be considered eligible because the California Integrated Waste Management Board also offers RMDZ loans?
A. As described, Reuse Assistance Grant funds or the matching contribution may not be used for the California Integrated Waste Management Board's Recycling Market Development Zone (RMDZ) program.
Additionally, only reuse projects are eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant, not recycling projects.

Q.
In reading the guidelines, it is clear that developing a feasibility study is not an eligible project for funding.
However, I am interested in any options for funding that would support this venture.
May grant funding be used for developing the groundwork for a feasibility study and pilot program? If video documentation of this process were submitted, could it be considered?
A. Feasibility studies, or projects related to developing the groundwork for feasibility studies and pilot programs are not eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant, as the Reuse Assistance Grants are intended for the establishment or expansion of tangible reuse programs.
Q. Does the following activity qualify under Reuse Assistance Grant criteria? A C
Reasons: this program needs more use in the San Diego area and more aggressive local networking is needed, especially for C
A. As described, improving/enhancing a local materials exchange program could be considered an eligible project for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
Please note that as this is a competitive grant, all proposed projects will be scored on several criteria including "Need," which is worth 30 points of the total 100 points available for this application, and "Objectives," which is worth 25 points of the total 100 points available for this application (see page 7 of the application).

Q.
Our City College is interested in applying for the Reuse Assistance Grant to create a furniture and equipment exchange for the College.
The establishment of this system would allow for us to substantively reduce the three 20-yard dumpsters we haul away monthly containing unused furniture or equipment.
Does this type of activity fall within the parameters of this grant?
A. As described, the project could be considered eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
However, please note that the City College must partner with a local public agency (with the local public agency as the applicant) in order to apply for a grant.
Q.
Could grant funds be used for cities to actually buy products that they use in the daily application of city business such as park benches made of recycled materials? Or, compost bins (made of recycled plastic content) and other compost products?
A. As described, purchasing products such as park benches or compost bins are not eligible projects, even though recycled benches or bins are proposed to be reused.
As stated in the application, composting projects are ineligible projects, and the Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to foster projects that take a material in its current form and reuse it in that form without any significant processing that would alter its material structure.

Q. Does the "General Checklist of Business Permits, Licenses, and Filings" need to be included regardless of the nature or scope of the project? And is the idea that an applicant would fill all lines with "Not Applicable" if appropriate to the project for which funding is being requested? Would such a submission be acceptable?
A.
The "General Checklist of Business Permits, Licenses, and Filings" must be included with the application, regardless of the nature or scope of the project.
The applicant would enter "Not Applicable", as appropriate.
Q. Will the statement, "printed on Xerox thirty percent (30%) post-consumer content multipurpose recycled paper" added at the bottom of each page suffice for the recycled paper requirement, considering that is the paper that will be used? If not, does the paper have to come with the message formatted by the paper manufacturer?
A.
A statement confirming that the paper on which the application is printed is comprised of a minimum of thirty percent (30%) post-consumer recycled content (e.g., "Printed on Xerox thirty percent (30%) post-consumer content multipurpose recycled paper") is acceptable in place of a recycled logo formatted by the paper manufacturer.

Funding Potential
Q. Due to the State budget crisis, is the California Integrated Waste Management Board still going to be able to fund the Reuse Assistance Grants? I learned of a City who applied for another agency's grant in June 2002, and the agency hasn't even been directed to look at the grants yet due to the budget crisis.
If we submit an application, what is the likelihood of the Reuse Assistance Grants even being available for which to apply?
A. While there is always a possibility that funding for the Reuse Assistance Grants program could diminish, at this time, the California Integrated Waste Management Board has not received any indication that this will happen, and is operating under its grant offering schedule (on page 2 of the application), as planned.
The California Integrated Waste Management Board is special funded, not general funded, which improves the likelihood of such programs as the Reuse Assistance Grants remaining in operation; however, this grant is subject to funding availability and as such we cannot guarantee that it will be awarded.
Q. Considering California's budget debt and expected cuts, what is the reality of funding this grant as of today's date (1/31/03)?
A. While there is always a possibility that funding for the Reuse Assistance Grants program could diminish, at this time, the California Integrated Waste Management Board has not received any indication that this will happen, and is operating under its grant offering schedule (on page 2 of the application), as planned.

Grant Funds
Q. Does the amount granted for the Reuse Assistance Grant have to cover all expenses to complete a project (such as a construction project) or can it simply be the funding that is added to the a larger pot as long as the project is completed in the two year time period?
A.
It is not required that the Reuse Assistance Grant funds and the matching contribution requirement cover all the expenses to complete the project; the grant funds may be added to a larger pot of funding for a project.
While the grant term is approximately two years, and the tasks delineated in the approved budget and work statement must be completed in that timeframe, it is not required that the overall project be completed in the two year time period.
Q. Am I required to pay back the Reuse Assistance Grants, as I would with a loan?
A.
The Reuse Assistance Grants are grants, not loans.
If all the requirements of the grant are met at the end of the grant term, grant funds do not have to be paid back.
Q.
Must awardees spend their own funds first, and then request reimbursement?
A. Grantees may spend their matching contribution and grant funds in any order they choose; however, at the conclusion of the grant term, the required matching contribution must have been spent in accordance with the approved budget, or the Grantee will be required to return the Grant funds that are in excess of the match requirement at a percentage rate equivalent to the percentage rate of the unmet match requirement.
For example, if a Grantee had requested $50,000 in grant funds, their required match amount is at least $25,000.
If, at the end of the grant term, the Grantee has expended $50,000 of the grant funds (and has been reimbursed for the $50,000), but expended only $15,000 of the matching contribution, then the Grantee would be required to return to the California Integrated Waste Management Board the excess $20,000 ($50,000-$30,000 (2x$15,000 (matching contribution))=$20,000) of grant funds.
Letters of Support
Q.
The application indicates that letters of support may come from businesses, organizations, or community members.
May they also come from government employees of neighboring local governments that are interested in supporting the ethic of reuse?
A. Yes, the letters of support may come from government employees of neighboring local governments that are interested in supporting the ethic of reuse.
Q. May the CEO of the partnering private business provide one of the letters of support?
A. Yes, the CEO of the partnering private business may provide one of the letters of support.

Matching Contribution
Q.
Is there a limit to the size (total cost) of the project?
A. While there is a maximum grant funding availability of $50,000, the matching contribution must be equal to or greater than 50 percent of the amount of the requested grant.
Consequently, there is no limit to the size (total cost) of the project.
Q.
We are considering a food rescue project.
Could the value of the donation of food count as part of the matching contribution of the grant?
A.
The value of the material targeted for reuse through the project may not be considered an eligible contribution towards the project.
Therefore, the value of the food donation would not be eligible as the matching contribution requirement.
Additionally, as stated on page 6 of the application, "'in-kind' contributions, with the exception of staff time, are ineligible".
Q. Will donations from individuals that are budgeted by my agency for our Reuse Assistance Program count as part of the matching contribution requirement? A. Yes, such funds can be used as the matching contribution requirement to apply towards eligible project costs.
The matching contribution may come from donations from the public, fundraisers, etc.
However, the matching contribution may not come from other California Integrated Waste Management Board grants, loans, or contracts.
Q.
Would in-kind hours be considered eligible as the matching contribution?
A.
The value of staff time of local public agencies, nonprofits, commercial businesses, private contractors/subcontractors, or volunteers may be used as matching contributions provided the time is dedicated solely to the performance of the grant project.
Q.
Is a donation of land considered an eligible matching contribution? The land donated would be the site of activity for the reuse of a material.
A. As stated on page 6 of the application, "'In-kind' contributions, with the exception of staff time, are ineligible" as the matching contribution.
Q.
According to Section H of the application guidelines, "Matching expenses are subject to the same restrictions and limitations as grant funds."
If the matching contribution includes overhead and indirect expenses for more than five percent (5%) of the matching grant award, is the grant still considered an eligible matching contribution?
A. Overhead and indirect costs above five percent (5%) of the grant award are ineligible costs, whether paid for with grant funds or the required matching contribution.
For example, a project that is requesting $50,000 must provide a minimum matching contribution of $25,000.
The maximum amount that may be used for overhead and indirect costs is five percent (5%) of the grant request ($2,500), whether these costs are paid for with grant funds or the matching contribution.
However, should the matching contribution exceed the minimum fifty percent (50%) of the grant request, the extra matching contribution may be used for overhead and indirect costs, as necessary.

Partnering
Q. May private businesses apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant? If so, would I apply under a local public agency such as the City?
A. Private businesses may partner with a local public agency to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant (with the local public agency as the applicant).
Q.
I am interested in applying for a Reuse Assistance Grant as my company is in the business of reconditioning and remanufacturing industrial electrical infrastructure equipment such as motors, transformers, switchboards, switchgear, motor control, and all of the components used to create electrical systems.
How can I get involved in this program to assist various agencies? All of them use electrical equipment and many of them purchase my company's products when the item needed is obsolete or difficult to find.
If my company was able to expand, more agencies could use my company's products more often and for larger applications.
A. As a local public agency must be the applicant in applying for a Reuse Assistance Grant, your company must seek out a willing local public agency with which to partner.
To partner with a local public agency, the nonprofit or business may contact an appropriate local public agency of their choice and form an agreement with that local public agency detailing the proposed grant project.
The agreement must be formed on the understanding that the local public agency will be the applicant for the grant, and therefore, will be responsible for administering the grant, and accountable for how the grant funds are expended.
If the local public agency is awarded grant funds, the grant funds will be used to implement the approved grant project.
In addition, since the local public agency is the Grantee, the Payment Request form must be submitted by the local public agency and payment will be made to the local public agency.
Q.
I realize that my company is not eligible to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant without partnering with a local public agency.
Can I get a list of grant applicants or agencies who could potentially qualify for such a grant so I could call on them in an attempt to partner with them to apply for a grant?
A.
A list of the Recycling Coordinators for California cities and counties is available on the Department of Conservation's Web site at http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dor/grants/index.htm.
This list is updated at the beginning of each month, and may be useful in soliciting a partnership with a local public agency.
Q.
My nonprofit, reused building materials store is located outside of California, but we wish to offer our nearly decade-long practical experience in the used building materials industry to local governments and other organizations in California.
How can I be put in touch with potential partners to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A.

Back to Top
Q.
My understanding is that since I am a business, I must get local businesses involved to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
How can I determine what cites are involved, as I have not had any success in finding a city willing to partner with me to apply for a grant?
A.
For the purposes of this grant offering, a "local public agency" is a city, county, or regional agency that has obligations to develop and implement waste reduction programs pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Â§ 40900 et seq.
Non-local public agencies (e.g., businesses, nonprofits) must partner with a local public agency, not another business, to apply for a grant.
As the eligible local public agencies have obligations to develop and implement waste reduction programs, many may be willing to partner with a business or nonprofit that will assist them in meeting their obligations.
Often, contacting the Solid Waste Department or similar department of an agency will be more effective.
Q.
I understand that private industry companies may partner with a local public agency (e.g., city or county) to apply for a grant.
However, I can't think of anything that cities or counties would have which we could reuse.
We do recycle many by-products (waste streams) from other industries such as materials containing calcium, silica, iron, or alumina.
These materials are changed into cement compounds and therefore, structurally modified.
Last year we used over 130,000 tons of these materials.
This does not include the over one million waste tires used for energy.
Also, we are using some waste soap for air entraining in the cement.
A. Partnering with a city or county does not require that the city or county have what the partner wishes to reuse; however, the city or county must be willing to support the project as the party responsible for the grant.
Please note that only projects that reuse nonhazardous materials are eligible for a Reuse Assistance Grantrecycling projects or projects that reuse hazardous materials are ineligible for grant funds or for the matching contribution component.
Also, the Reuse Assistance Grants are intended to foster projects that reuse a material over again in its current form without any significant processing that alters its material structure.
Q.
Can you provide me with the name of an agency in our county that would partner with my business on a project for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. Potential applicants may first want to try to contact the city or county in which their business is located.
While business/nonprofits are not limited to partner only with local public agencies near the business/nonprofit, those nearby may be the most convenient.
A list of the Recycling Coordinators for California cities and counties is available on the Department of Conservation's Web site at http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dor/grants/index.htm.
This list is updated at the beginning of each month, and may be useful in soliciting a partnership with a local public agency.
Q. May my nonprofit organization partner with the California Integrated Waste Management Board to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A. As stated in the application, nonprofits must partner with a local public agency to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant.
The California Integrated Waste Management Board is a State Agency, not a local public agency, and therefore would not be an eligible partner.
Q.
What evidence of partnership is needed for my nonprofit organization to partner with a local public agency to apply for a Reuse Assistance Grant?
A.
The applicant (the local public agency) must submit a Resolution with the application package that delineates its proposed partnership with your nonprofit organization.
Q.
If I am a business, do I need to find an agency with which to partner?
A. Nonlocal public agencies (e.g., businesses, nonprofits, etc.) must find a local public agency with which to partner.
Q.
Could you please list specific municipal programs (and refer to their corresponding PARIS code) that this Reuse Assistance Grant does fund? It will help with justifying to City Council to allocate time and money to the grant process.
A.

Recycled-Content Purchasing Policy
Q.
Must an applicant's Recycled Content Purchasing Policy be in effect before submittal or award?
A.
An applicant's Recycled Content Purchasing Policy must be in effect by the application due date (February 28, 2003).
The Recycled-Content Purchasing Policy must have been adopted/modified within the last five (5) years to receive full credit.
Adoption or modification of policy during the application period is acceptable and will receive full credit.
Q.
In the event of a public/private partnership, can the partnering private business's Recycled-Content Purchasing Policy suffice for the requirements set forth by #7 of the General Review Criteria, or does the policy have to be specific to the public agency applicant? If the applicant agency does not have a Recycled-Content Purchasing Policy, will the partnering private business's policy be appropriate to submit with the application, and if so, count for any points in that category?
A.
In the event of a local public agency/private partnership, the local public agency is required to have a current Recycled-Content Purchasing Policy in order to receive full credit.
While it is preferred that the partnering private business also have a current Recycled-Content Purchasing Policy, the partner's policy cannot be used to meet this requirement.
Resolution
Q. Does the California Integrated Waste Management Board need the Resolution authorizing the submittal of the application from the City Council before the February 28, 2003 deadline?
A.
It is preferred that the Resolution be submitted with the application package that is due by 2:00 p.m. on February 28, 2003.
As stated on pages 9 and 26 of the application, the Resolution authorizing the submittal of the application "may be submitted after February 28, 2003 only if the local public agency can show good cause in its application as to why the Resolution was not turned in on time; however, the Resolution must be received by March 12, 2003."
Q.
We have Resolutions from all our jurisdictions (passed in 2000) that cover our grant submittals through 2010.
According to the application requirements, Resolutions are only to cover five year periods.
Please confirm whether or not our existing Resolution (which has been accepted for California Integrated Waste Management Board grants for the past two years) will be acceptable.
A.
If the Resolution was passed in 2000, it would meet the requirement for this Reuse Assistance Grant offering, as the Resolution is only three years old.
The California Integrated Waste Management Board has limited blanket multi-year Resolutions for all grants to a period of no more than five years.
Therefore, on or before its anniversary date in 2005, your jurisdiction should obtain a new Resolution, which may extend up to five years.
