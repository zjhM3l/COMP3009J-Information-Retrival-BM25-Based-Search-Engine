Current Status:
Continuing threats to the squirrel include a possible loss in the quality of its remaining forest habitat due to introduced pest insects, deleterious effects on the squirrel's environment caused by pesticides used to control the insects, and die-offs of spruce and spruce-fir trees associated with acid precipitation and heavy metal pollution.
Achievements:
Numerous captures at various locations show the subspecies to be more abundant than known at the time of listing.
For instance, 17 new sites were discovered in 1992.
The new captures indicated that several occupied habitats once thought to be disjunct are continuous.
Northern flying squirrel habitat occurs primarily on national forests, and protection through the section 7 consultation process has been very effective.
Standards and guidelines to protect the squirrel in the Monongahela National Forest were established by the Forest Service and approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service.
In addition, after evaluating several types of projects, the Forest Service agreed to modify some timber sales.
As a result of section 7 activities, five new squirrel sites were discovered in 1992.
Current Recovery Needs:
Forest Service management prescriptions benefitting the squirrel need to be continued.
The Fish and Wildlife Service is currently considering reclassifying the Virginia northern flying squirrel from endangered to threatened status.
However, monitoring to confirm population stability or growth is needed.
Section 6 Funding and Activities:
The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources received $8,000 in both FY 1991 and FY 1992 to monitor squirrels in the Monongahela National Forest.
Two new sites were discovered in 1992 through activities undertaken with section 6 funds.
Partnerships
Forest Service: In accordance with its Monongahela National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, the Forest Service has made protecting the northern flying squirrel an integral goal in its planning process, which has resulted in significant habitat identification and protection.
West Virginia Division of Natural Resources: This State agency has been instrumental in conducting a major monitoring study on the northern flying squirrel.
Results have shown the squirrel to be more abundant than originally thought.
Recovery Plan Status:
Plan approved 9/24/90.
