Environmental Assessment: Integrated Pest Management Nonnative Plant Management Great Basin National Park Baker, Nevada U.S. Department of the Interior National Park Service
Summary Page
Proposed Actions:
Great Basin National Park (GRBA) has developed four alternatives to develop and implement a Integrated Pest Management plan for controlling and containing the spread of nonnative plants.
The GRBA General Management Plan (GMP) calls for nonnative plants to be eradicated or controlled if they threatened to spread or compete with park resources.
Ten species are concern wherever they occur because of their extremely detrimental effects on native plant communities and native ecosystems and their ability to spread.
These are:
Spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) * Musk thistle (Carduus nutans)* Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare)* Field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis)* Common mullein (Verbascum thapsus) Crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum) Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis ) Common timothy (Phleum pratense) Russian thistle (Salsola iberica)*
Four of these species are of utmost concern and will be the main emphasis for control actions*.
The four alternatives include: 1) No action; 2) treatment by mechanical methods such as pulling and cutting; 3) treatment by mechanical methods such as pulling and cutting and selective spot treatment with chemical herbicides for those species possessing the greatest risk of spread and, 4) treatment by mechanical methods such as pulling and cutting, selective spot treatment with chemical herbicides for those species possessing the greatest risk of spread, and the introduction of host specific biological controls for species covering large contiguous areas.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION: PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION
1.0 PURPOSE
This Environmental Assessment (EA) describes and discloses the environmental consequences of a proposal to prepare and implement an Integrated Pest Management plan for a multi-year program to control and contain the spread of nonnative plants.
The preferred management alternative will be scheduled for implementation in fiscal year 2000.
The preferred alternative will be consistent with the overall management direction provided by the Great Basin National Park (GRBA) General Management Plan (GMP) and the National Park Service (NPS-77) Natural Resources Management Guidelines.
1.
PROPOSED ACTION
GRBA proposes to prepare and implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan for a multi-year program to control and contain the spread of nonnative plants within the parks boundaries.
Exotic plant control programs can be quite complex because each species will probably require a different monitoring and control strategy.
Long-term or even permanent management commitments and consistent follow-up are essential to successful exotic plant control programs.
Persistent seed banks and long-lived seeds often require control efforts over many years to eradicate exotic plants in the park, even with current localized populations of some species.
Systematic approaches utilizing a variety of approaches (mechanical, chemical, and biological) with consistent yearly monitoring are the key to effective control efforts.
There are 42 species of nonnative herbaceous plants known to occur in GRBA.
Ten species are of concern wherever they occur based on their extremely detrimental effects on native plant communities and ecosystems and their ability to spread.
The ten species of greatest concern are:
Spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa)
Musk thistle (Carduus nutans)
Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare)
Field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis)
Common mullein (Verbascum thapsus)
Crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum)
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis )
Common timothy (Phleum pratense)
Russian thistle (Salsola iberica)
1.2 LOCATION
GRBA is located in east central White Pine County, Nevada near the Utah border.
The park encompasses 77,100 acres of the southern Snake Range.
The park was established in 1986 and incorporates two areas formerly managed by the federal government: a 76,460-acre portion of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest (HNF) and the NPSs 640-acre Lehman Caves National Monument.
Wheeler Peak, the 13,063-foot center piece of the park, overlooks two expansive basins, Spring Valley to the west and Snake Valley to the east, but includes only 80 acres of the basin environment as an administrative site.
The park is surrounded by the HNF, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and private lands.
The park is 300 miles north of Las Vegas, 250 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, and 10 miles south of U.S. Highway 50.
The nearest town is Baker, 5 miles from the current park headquarters.
Sixty-five miles to the west, Ely, Nevada, provides major services and a regional airport.
Delta, Utah, is 90 miles to the east.
1.3 NEED FOR ACTION
Nonnative plant species threaten native plant communities and the wildlife that depend on them.
Nonnative plants, particularly invasive ones, are capable of diminishing site productivity, degrading ecosystems, decreasing plant and animal diversity, and damaging the hydrologic function of a watershed.
Nationwide, the problem of invasive nonnative plants is critical.
In various areas of the country leafy spurge, kudzu, tamarisk, purple loosestrife, spotted knapweed, and other invasive exotic plants are wreaking havoc on public lands.
Fortunately, GRBA has the opportunity to work proactively to curtail the problem in the park before it becomes out of hand.
The park has already committed itself to working cooperatively with the HNF, BLM, and the White Pine County Agricultural Extension Service to control and eradicate nonnative plants from the county.
The park is at a critical juncture in nonnative plant control.
With careful treatment and monitoring GRBA can prevent the spread of invasive nonnatives and reestablish native plant communities.
Control of nonnatives is complicated.
A combination of educational, mechanical, chemical, and biological means is often needed to achieve effective management goals.
There are 42 species of nonnative herbaceous plants growing within the parks boundaries.
Thirty of these were compiled or identified by Richard J. Shaw (1995); surveys done in 1998 and 1999 by resource management personnel added another twelve species.
Four of the ten species listed above are considered of utmost concern wherever they occur because of their detrimental effects on native plant communities and native ecosystems and their ability to spread.
The park is at a critical juncture in nonnative plant control.
With careful treatment and monitoring it can prevent the invasion and/or spread of invasive nonnatives and reestablish native plant communities.
Exotic, alien, introduced, nonindigenous, and nonnative are all synonyms for species that humans intentionally or unintentionally introduce into an area outside of a species natural range.
NPS defines nonnative species as any animal or plant species that occurs in a given location as a result of direct, indirect, deliberate, or accidental actions by humans (USDI 1996).
Thus, species native to the North American continent, if present outside their normal range due to the actions of humans, are considered exotics by the NPS.
This definition allows the NPS to recognize and distinguish between changes to park resources caused by natural processes of animals and plants, such as natural range expansions, and those changes caused by animals and plants that are introduced by humans.
Functionally, nonnative means plant species not present in the floristic Great Basin before settlement by European-Americans.
Some nonnative plants are relatively benign.
On the other hand, invasive nonnative plants are able to out compete native plants for resources.
Many are able to quickly invade recently disturbed ground and prevent the establishment of native species.
Some will invade established plant communities through a variety of means.
Spotted knapweed, a species of utmost concern at GRBA, is a successful invader because it not only exploits disturbed ground but invades new areas by secreting biotoxins through its roots that inhibits the growth of other species.
1.4 AUTHORITY FOR ACTION
National Park Service policy and recent legislation (National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998) requires that park managers know the condition of natural resources under their stewardship and monitor long-term trends in those resources in order to fulfill the NPS mission of conserving parks unimpaired.
The following laws and management policies provide the mandate for controlling nonnative plants in national parks:
The mission of the National Park Service is "to promote and regulate the use of the Federal areas known as national parks, monuments, and reservations hereinafter specified by such means and measures as conform to the fundamental purposes of the said parks, monuments, and reservations, which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations" (National Park Service Organic Act, 1916).
"Naturally evolving plant and animal populations, and the human influences on them, will be monitored to detect any significant unnatural changes.
Action will be taken in the case of such changes based on the type and extent of change and the appropriate management policy" (NPS Management Policies).
National Park Service Resource Management Guidelines NPS-77, 4:12 states: "Management of populations of exotic plant and animal species, up to and including eradication, will be undertaken wherever such species threaten park resources or public healthHigh priority will be given to the management of exotic species that have a substantial impact on park resources and that can be reasonably expected to be successfully controlled."
Removal of nonnative plants is acceptable under 516 DM6 App. 7.4 E(7) Removal of park resident individuals of non-threatened/endangered species which pose a danger to visitors, threaten park resources or become a nuisance in areas surrounding the park, when such removal is included in an approved resource management plan.
The General Management Plan, 1993, for GRBA states that "nonnative species will be eradicated or controlled if they threaten to spread or compete with park resources and if control is feasible."
The GRBA Resource Management Plan, 1999, states that the park will:
1) Adopt and utilize IPM approaches to help solve insect and weed pest problems.
The focus would be on prevention and early detection of pest problems, emphasizing mechanical and biological controls whenever possible.
Initiate the use of restricted pesticides.
All control programs should be monitored to evaluate their effectiveness in eliminating the target species and their actual impacts on nontarget organisms.
Continue to provide training for park personnel including the Integrated Pest Management Coordinator.
2) Continue to monitor exotic plant species throughout the park for potential impacts on the parks natural ecosystem.
Prepare an Exotic Plant Management Plan based on IPM that categorizes the threat of each alien species, establishes strategies for control and preventing dispersal, and identifies alien species present in the local area that might pose a threat if they are introduced into the park.
The Exotic Plant Management Plan should be coordinated with identification of cultural landscapes.
Hire a summer crew to conduct mitigation work on exotic plant species.
Authority to use biological controls comes from National Park Service Management Policies (1988); "Nonnative (nonnative) plants and animals will not be introduced into natural zones except in rare cases where they are the nearest living relatives of extirpated native species, where they are improved varieties of native species that cannot survive current environmental conditions, where they may be used to control established nonnative species, or when directed by law or expressed legislative intent."
1.5 PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Based on the issues identified and related NPS management criteria, the selected alternative will meet the following objectives:
1) Contain and control those nonnative plants that are a threat to resources at GRBA.
2) Educate visitors and park employees on invasive nonnative plant issues and identification
3) Assess the presence, distribution, and density of nonnative species in the park.
1.6 DECISION TO BE MADE
The Superintendent of GRBA is the responsible official for deciding the type and level of nonnative plant management that will take place in the park.
The NPS Pacific West Regional Directors has signature authority and his decision will be stated and explained in the Decision Notice that will accompanying this EA upon public review.
This EA is concerned only with the impacts associated with the proposed action.
Other Federal, state, and local jurisdictions have been consulted on the proposed action.
The proposed action has been discussed with the White Pine County Weed Board, Nevada Weed Management Association, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
While no specific recommendations were received, they encouraged GRBA to become partners to assist with the control of nonnative plants in the State of Nevada which are having large scale impacts on public and private lands.
1.7 SCOPING
Scoping is an early and open process to solicit public and internal concerns relating to a proposed action.
Issues are generated from scoping comments that drive the National Environmental Policy Act process and determine the range of actions, alternatives and impacts to be addressed.
Federal Register Notice Vol. 49, No. 99 (516 DM-2-4), dated 12, 1984, and NPS-12 NEPA guidelines require scoping of Federal actions.
* On January 25, 1999, a project proposal newsletter was mailed to all addressees on the GRBA NEPA mailing list.
The newsletter described the proposed development of an IPM plan for the control of nonnative plants and asked for comments to be submitted by March 1, 1999.
* On April 12, 1999, a public meeting was held in Baker, Nevada to discuss proposed GRBA projects and solicit public comments and concerns.
The IPM project was discussed.
* No issues, comments or concerns were received from the newsletter or were raised at the public meeting concerning the proposed IPM plan for the control of nonnative plants at GRBA.
* An interdisciplinary team meet on August 15, 1999 and September 21, 1999 to develop a list of potential issues to drive the NEPA analysis
Consultation with Native Americans
On August 31, 1999 GRBA met with representatives of our Consulting Tribes.
Tribes with members present were the Ely Shoshone Tribe, Kanosh Band of Paiute Tribe, Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, Kaibab Paiute Tribe, and the Paiute Tribe of Utah.
The proposed nonnative plant control proposal was discussed at this meeting.
No concerns were raised by any tribal members.
1.8 ISSUES
1.
Effects on Vegetative Resources
Nonnative plants out compete and replace native plants overtime.
This decreases the diversity of native plant communities.
Nonnative plants, particularly invasive ones, are capable of diminishing site productivity, degrading ecosystems, decreasing plant species diversity, and damaging the hydrologic function of a watershed.
2.
Effects on Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources.
As mandated by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and NPS 77, Natural Resources Management Guidelines, the NPS will identify and promote the conservation of all Federally listed threatened, endangered, or candidate species within park boundaries and their critical habitats.
The National Park Service also will identify all state and locally listed threatened, endangered, rare, declining, sensitive, or candidate species that are native to and present in the parks, and their critical habitats.
All management actions will be assessed for the protection and perpetuation of special status species.
Twenty-two species of rare and/or sensitive plant species occur in or near Great Basin National Park and could be threatened by nonnative species.
3.
Effects on wildlife resources.
A total of 72 mammals are known to occur or potentially occur in the park and on the administrative site in Baker, Nevada.
Two hundred and thirty eight species of birds have been seen and documented in the Snake Range and Snake Valley.
A total of 28 reptiles and 8 amphibians are suspected to occur in the park.
These species are dependent on native plant and animal communities for cover and forage.
Over time, nonnative plants out compete and replace native plants.
This decreases the diversity, quantity, and quality of forage and the habitat carrying capacity is reduced.
This also affects insect populations and the effects can cascade through out the food chain.
As native herbaceous vegetation is lost to nonnative plants ground cover for ground-nesting birds also becomes limited.
Taken together, these can result in a complete loss of wildlife from an area.
4.
Effects on Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive wildlife resources.
As mandated by Endangered Species Act and NPS 77, Natural Resources Management Guidelines, the NPS will identify and promote the conservation of all Federally listed threatened, endangered, or candidate species within park boundaries and their critical habitats.
The National Park Service also will identify all state and locally listed threatened, endangered, rare, declining, sensitive, or candidate species that are native to and present in the parks, and their critical habitats.
All management actions will be assessed for the protection and perpetuation of special status species.
Forty-four species of rare and/or sensitive animal species occur in or near Great Basin National Park and could be threatened by nonnative species.
5.
Effects on water resources.
Nonnative plants are typically invader type species that have less fibrous root systems than native plants.
As nonnative species increase in an area, soil erosion levels can increase.
This increased erosion increases sedimentation in streams and reduces water quality for all aquatic species and animal consumption.
After the streams leave the park, they eventually cross onto private land and are used for irrigation, livestock watering, and drinking purposes by local residents.
Several streams have developed or primitive campsites along them.
Over 90,000 visitors also come to GRBA annually and many enjoy recreating along the parks streams and may use streams for drinking, cooking, and bathing as well as the enjoying the scenic beauty of native riparian areas within the Great Basin.
5.
Effects of visitors.
Seeds, plants and plant parts may be introduced via air or water, domestic and wild animals, earth fill, construction equipment, stock feed and visitors.
Park visitors can unwittingly transport plant parts in the undercarriage or doors of their vehicles, tire treads, pets coats, clothing, and the soles of their shoes.
Established park populations of nonnative plants are able to spread through these same routes.
Preventing the introduction of nonnative plants is the first line of defense in protecting ecosystems from degradation.
It is also the most economical and efficient means of management.
6.
Effects to Health and safety
There are certain amounts of health and safety risk associated with implementation of an IMP program.
The inappropriate application of chemical herbicides has the potential to enter into the human environment adversely affecting human health.
The application process alone if not done according to established standards and using all required protective gear can pose health risks to the applicator.
Treating nonnative plant by any means along roadways and developed sites put the employee at risk from inattentive motor vehicle operators.
1.9 ISSUES DROPPED FROM ANALYSIS
No issues were dropped from further analysis in this EA.
CHAPTER 2
AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
This chapter describes the affected environment within the proposed action area.
This chapter deals with the conditions found based on existing management, resource conditions, and data in relation to those issues found significant from the scoping process.
Natural resource management objectives identified in the GRBA GMP are: Manage the park to maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation.
a.
Eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources.
b. Determine the extant of plant and animal diversity, monitor changes that are occurring and identify the sources of change; eliminate or mitigate any identified adverse impacts, recognizing that native populations fluctuate naturally.
c. Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man. d. Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges.
2.1 NONNATIVE PLANTS
For the most part, nonnative plant control has never been conducted nor budgeted at GRBA following any standardized protocols that targeted species and contained implementation, effectiveness and validation monitoring.
Past efforts involved all employee workdays in which parks staff hand pulled the most visible nonnative plants from areas of visitor use.
Other projects were all dependent on submitting project proposals for funding, few of which were approved.
Between 1998 and 1999 a nonnative plant inventory of eastside drainages was completed to facilitate the development of a scientifically based nonnative plant control program.
The inventory created a GIS compatible database to assist in the control, management and monitoring of nonnative plants.
Mechanical control strategies have been implemented that targeted species of concern from this inventory.
There are 42 species of nonnative herbaceous plants growing within the parks boundaries.
An inventory, review of literature, and ranking analysis facilitated the prioritization of species to be targeted for management actions.
The analyses, thoroughly explained below, found that there are ten species are of concern.
They are:
Spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa)
Musk thistle (Carduus nutans)
Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare)
Field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis)
Common mullein (Verbascum thapsus)
Crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum)
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis )
Common timothy (Phleum pratense)
Russian thistle (Salsola iberica)
Further analyses found that four of these species are of serious concern wherever they occur due to their extremely detrimental effects on native plant communities and native ecosystems, their ability to spread and the potential to control and contain in a cost effective manner.
These four species will be the emphasis for control actions.
They are:
Musk thistle (Carduus nutans)
Spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa)
Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare)
Field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis)
The following nonnative plants occur in GRBA: 1.

42.
Verbascum thapsus L. (common mullein)
Some nonnative plants are relatively benign; others are so widespread as to be virtually uncontrollable (cheatgrass/Kentucky bluegrass).
Other nonnative herbaceous species may soon be of concern.
Salt cedar or tamarisk, a serious nonnative plant issue in most southwestern National Parks, occurs less than one mile from the park in the Baker Creek and Lehman Creek drainages.
Additionally, GRBA must be on the alert for introductions and invasions of nonnatives with expanding ranges, many of which are already found in White Pine County.
These following list of nonnative species are already found in other parts of Nevada.
They have the ability to become established in GRBA.
Monitoring for these species and taking immediate and aggressive control actions can help prevent their establishment.

In accordance with NPS policies, the current and potential ecological impacts of known nonnative plant species in GRBA were examined A ranking system was modified from the Handbook for Ranking Exotic Plants for Management and Control (Hiebert and Stubbendieck 1993).
Nonnative plants known to be present in the park were assigned numerical ratings based on their current impacts on native plant communities, their ability to become pests, and the feasibility of their treatment or management.
Current impacts evaluated the number of populations, maximum percent cover per square meter, areal extent of populations, effect on community composition and wildlife, and threat to riparian areas.
Ability to become a pest evaluated mode, cycle, and frequency of reproduction, number of seeds per plant, modes of seed dispersal, germination requirements, competitive ability, known negative impacts, and alleleopathy.
Feasibility of control evaluated location of populations, ease of treatment, response to restoration procedures, and response to grazing.
Information for the ranking system was obtained from both literature reviews and field inventories
Based on the sum of their numerical ratings, species that were likely to increase in density and/or abundance within one year were considered "high" urgency.
Species likely to increase in density and/or abundance in five years were labeled "medium" urgency.
Species unlikely to increase in density and/or abundance in five years were labeled "low" urgency.
For a review of the ranking criteria process see appendix 1.
Tables 1 and 2 present the results for the high and medium urgency categories.
Watersheds and developed sites were also ranked.
The number of nonnative species present assessed watersheds.
Nineteen of the most commonly encountered nonnative herbaceous species were used in this assessment.
Lehman Creek Watershed ranked first of the seven watersheds inventoried with all of the 19 of the most commonly encountered nonnative herbaceous species present.
Baker Creek ranked second with 15 of the 19 species present, and Snake Creek ranked third with 13 of the 19 species present.
All of the developed sites are located within the three top ranked watersheds.

Characteristics
MUSK THISTLE
Carduus nutans
Musk thistle is an erect (0.5-3 m tall) biennial or winter annual, taprooted forb.
It occurs solitarily or with several stems from one base and is highly branched above (Desrochers, A.M., et.
Al. 1988).
Initial growth is in the form of a well-developed basal rosette.
Musk thistle is a highly competitive, noxious weed.
A native of Eurasia, it was first reported in North America during the period of 1853 to 1866 (Butterfield, C., J. et al 1996).
Both early and later introductions may have been for ornamental uses.
Musk thistle has been found in three locations on the east side of the park.
In Upper Lehman Campground (Lehman Creek Watershed) along the road to sites 17 to 24, and in other places throughout the campground 87 second year plants were located in 1999.
Along Snake Creek Road (Snake Creek Watershed) approximately 20 plants were found between primitive campsites 6 and 7 in 1999.
In Strawberry Creek Watershed a patch of 110 second year plants and 52 rosettes were found in 1999, 100 meters north of the road at around 8500 in elevation on a south-facing slope.
Biological, chemical, and mechanical treatment methods have all been used on musk thistle with varying levels of success.
An important consideration is that the seeds will remain viable in the seed bank for at least 10 years, thus removal of living plants will not totally eradicate the population.
Treatment methods that involve soil disturbance will favor reinvasion by musk thistle or by other nonnative species.
Many native thistles are in the area and should not be subjected to treatment, making proper identification important.
From 1992 through 1996, Youth Conservation Crews (YCC) hand-pulled nonnative plants in GRBA.
Thistles were pulled from Upper Lehman Campground around the Lehman Creek trailhead and from the ditch on the north side of the road to sites 17-24.
This is the exact area of one of the present musk thistle infestations (seeds remain viable for ten years) therefore it is assumed that this is what they pulled.
Thistles were pulled from the side of the road (Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive) between Lower to Upper Lehman Campgrounds.
Bull thistle now grows in this area, it is assumed that this is what they pulled.
No detailed records of the hand pulling were kept, nor was any quantitative monitoring done.
SPOTTED KNAPWEED
Centaurea maculosa
C. maculosa is a biennial or short lived perennial composite with a stout taproot.
It has 1-20 slender, upright stems, 3-10 dm tall, most branching in the upper half.
Seedling leaves form a rosette; stem leaves are canescent, the lower once or twice pinnately divided into linear or lanceolate lobes on each side of center vein, tapered at both ends, the broadest part above the middle to 10 cm long and 3 cm wide; the upper with fewer lobes or entire, becoming smaller up the stem to less than 1 cm long.
A native of Europe, C. maculosa was accidentally introduced to North America in the 1890s in alfalfa seed from Asia Minor (Maddox 1979).
Spotted knapweed was collected in Victoria, B.C. in 1893 (Moore 1972).
It is assumed that soil carried on ships as ballast and unloaded in the port transported knapweed seed to this site at that time.
The competitive superiority of this species suggests preadaptation to disturbance.
The initial invasion of spotted knapweed, like other noxious weeds, is correlated highly to disturbed areas.
Once a plant or colony is established though, it may invade areas that are relatively undisturbed or in good condition with gradual, broad, frontal expansion.
Spotted knapweed is very aggressive.
Treatment of this species is mandated by county and state agencies.
It is listed as noxious in Nevada.
It is encouraged to integrate mechanical, chemical and biological treatments to achieve eradication objective.
Spotted knapweed has been documented in three of nine inventoried east side watersheds.
These are Lehman Creek, Baker Creek, and Strawberry Creek watersheds.
Lehman Creek watershed hosts several C. maculosa populations.
The population with the greatest density and area is the "Route 488" population.
Spotted knapweed extends from 50 meters below (east of) the park boundary up Route 488 toward the Visitor Center.
It is on both sides of the road in swaths ranging from 1 to 6 meters wide.
Cover is up to 100%.
In 1999, 211 spotted knapweed plants (both first- and second-year) were found in the lower orchard, 394 in the upper orchard, 135 throughout the visitor center parking lot and associated areas, 1739 along the road to the visitor center picnic area, 245 by the picnic area restrooms and 294 in the residential area.
Individuals were reported at 10,000 in the parking area at the entrance to the Wheeler Peak Campground in 1997 (Bob Wilson, NV Coop.
Extension, pers. comm.); this has not been confirmed yet by GRBA Resource Management personnel.
In Baker Creek watershed in 1999, 1343 first- and second-year plants made up the "Baker Creek Trailhead" population at 8,000.
Knapweed grows in the moist soil near the outhouse and in the "island" area encircled by the road.
It is most dense in the compacted soil at the edge of the gravel road.
Strawberry Creek watershed has two known roadside populations of spotted knapweed.
The first, consisting of 690 plants, is located above the first stream crossing.
The second population, of four plants, was found between the second and third stream crossings.
Attempts to treat knapweed have taken various forms.
From 1991 through 1996, YCC volunteers, fire crew and resource management and maintenance personnel pulled knapweed wherever it was encountered.
Several hundred hours were spent in these endeavors.
In 1991, the Chief of Interpretation and Resource Management wrote, in a memo dated July 26, that spotted knapweed was present at the Baker Ranger Station, the Baker Creek trailhead, the park entrance, the visitor center picnic area and the visitor center parking lot.
He wrote: "the worst area of infestation continues to be at the visitor center parking lot."
In 1999, the worst of the aforementioned areas, in regards to abundance were (from greatest to least abundance): the road to the visitor center picnic area (1984 plants); Baker Creek trailhead (1343 plants); Park entrance on Route 488 (est. 1000 plants); Visitor Center parking lot PLUS upper and lower orchards PLUS small population on Route 488 near parking lot (838 plants); and, Baker ranger station (unknown).
During some summers, including the summer of 1998, the Route 488 population was mowed.
However, after mowing, plants produced more flowerheads from short, cut stems.
No reported inventorying or monitoring was done prior to 1998.
BULL THISTLE
Cirsium vulgare
Cirsium vulgare is a biennial herb of the sunflower family.
Its root system consists of several primary roots each with several smaller lateral roots.
One of the primary roots is much longer (up to 70 cm) and thicker than the others, forming a taproot (Klinkhamer and de Jong 1993).
This noxious thistle reproduces solely by seed and does not have the capability to reproduce vegetatively.
Cirsium vulgare is a native of Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa and is now established on every continent except Antarctica (Randall 1994).
C. vulgare is reported to have been introduced into the eastern United States during colonial times and also into the western United States several times near the turn of the century (Randall 1994).
Its current distribution in the United States includes all 48 contiguous states as well as both Alaska and Hawaii (Randall 1994, Lym and Zollinger 1995).
It is a problem in disturbed areas as well as in natural areas (Randall 1994) although its association with disturbed areas is more pronounced.
Bull thistle has been found in three of the nine surveyed east side watersheds.
There are three large and distinct populations of bull thistle, as well as numerous small patches and scattered individuals in the surveyed watersheds.
The Water Intake population is located in Lehman Creek watershed at the fenced intake area located below Lower Lehman Campground..
An estimated several thousand individuals sprawled across an area of 200 square meters of moist, disturbed ground.
In some areas a density of five or more individuals per square meter with 100% cover was attained.
In other areas C. vulgare was mixed in with hydric species.
Smaller patches are located outside the fenced area to the north and to the east.
The second largest population is located in Lower Lehman Campground bounded by the campsite loop road and the Scenic Drive.
In 1999, 2885 second year plants were counted and cut at the base of the stalk.
Bull thistle extends from this area downhill for several hundred meters.
Several patches are located across the Scenic Drive from the campground, around the large campground sign and downhill along the road.
The third largest population is the Baker Creek Trailhead population located at the base of the circle at the end of Baker Creek Road, and to the south of the road.
The area affected runs from the edge of the road south toward Baker Creek.
A 40m by 3m swath is covered primarily with bull thistle.
Outside this area, to a width of 20 m, bull thistle is present but in lower density.
Thirty individuals were located in 1998 at 6860, 100 m south of Baker Creek and below the entrance to Model Cave. C. vulgare also was encountered in Lower Lehman campground, on the Scenic Drive, at the water intake area and in the residential area.
Several individuals were seen in the Lower Lehman campground at 7320 at sites 3, 4, 5 and 7 and across the road and south of site 11.
Some individuals were located less than 10 meters from Lehman Creek.
Less than 5 individuals were located in the residential area by the stairs to the middle apartment of the "three-pack" (6800).
From 1992 to 1996 YCC volunteers reported pulling "thistle" from Lower and Upper Lehman Campgrounds and from along the Scenic Drive between the campgrounds.
It is highly probable that much of this thistle was C. vulgare (at least some of the plants in Upper Lehman Campground probably were Carduus nutans).
Apparently the treatment was at least fairly successful along the Scenic Drive.
Reportedly, thistle lined the upper side of the road between Lower and Upper Lehman Campgrounds (Rhea Deardon, pers. comm.).
In 1998, only 100 bull thistle plants were found in this region, although many more were found further down the road.
In 1998 the stems of approximately 850 individual bull thistle plants in the Baker Creek Trailhead population were hand-cut prior to antithesis.
No other known populations were subjected to treatment.
FIELD BINDWEED
Convolvulus arvensis
C. arvensis is a common weed of roadsides, railroads, gardens, fields (especially in dry farming areas).
It is able to grow under most cultivated conditions.
Because of its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions, it may be found at altitudes as high as 10,000'.
Field bindweed is common on more basic soils and those of heavier texture.
It can be found on rich somewhat sandy or gravely dry to moist soils and is capable of surviving periods of drought.
A native of Europe, C. arvensis likely was introduced to North America in 1870 in wheat, from Turkey.
It is widespread throughout the U.S. (except the extreme southern border) and southern Canada.
In Colorado, C. arvensis is found from 4000 to 10,000'.
Field bindweed reproduces by seeds and creeping roots.
Even small root fragments may give rise to new plants.
The root system is extensive and may go down 6-9 meters in the soil (Holm et al. 1977).
It flowers from June to September and occasionally until the first frost in fall.
Plant biotypes appear to be self-incompatible.C. arvensis is a troublesome and difficult species to eradicate due to its very extensive root system and seed longevity.
Nearby agricultural lands can provide a continuous source of reinvasion from seed dispersal.
C. arvensis has been identified in Lehman Creek Watershed.
Field bindweed has been found in both parking islands in the Visitor Center parking lot, in the orchards, and below the orchards, throughout the old alfalfa field.
There are four populations along the Scenic Drive, and one along Route 488.
A patch one square meter in area was located in the Residential Area at the "3-Pack" in 1999.
It is located in several areas in both Upper and Lower Lehman Campgrounds.
In Snake Creek Watershed, field bindweed was found in 1999 along the road below the third stream crossing.
There is no record of past treatment or monitoring.
It was not formally identified in the park until 1998 (although it was present).
COMMON TIMOTHY
Phleum pratense
Timothy is an introduced, cool-season, perennial bunchgrass that grows from 20 to 40 inches (51-102 cm) tall.
Culms emerge from a swollen or bulblike base, and form large clumps.
The flowering heads of timothy are cylindrical and spikelike, and about 6 inches (15 cm) long.
The one-flowered spikelet produces seeds that are small and enclosed in awned, urn-shaped husks.
Leaves of timothy are flat and 3 to 13 inches (7.6-33 cm) long.
Timothy is generally short-lived (4 to 5 years) but can live up to 6 or 7 years.
Timothy has a moderately shallow and fibrous root system; roots can extend to 48 inches (120 cm) in depth.
Timothy is nonrhizomatous.
Timothy plants contain corms at their base which are annual, forming in early summer and dying the next year when the seed matures.
Timothy is of Eurasian origin but was first cultivated in the United States in the 1700s.
In 1747, timothy spread from New England to Canada and westward.
Timothy is found in all 50 states and throughout Canada, except on Prince Edward Island and in Labrador.
Timothy is widely cultivated in the northeastern states south to the Cotton Belt and west to the 100th meridian, in humid regions of Puget Sound, and in mountainous regions.
Because it is widespread within the park, and often growing in dense monospecific patches, the treatment of timothy is difficult.
Prevention of establishment of new populations of timothy is the best strategy.
Timothy was found in six of eleven inventoried watersheds.
These were Baker Creek, Lehman Creek, Strawberry Creek, Mill Creek, Burnt Mill, and Pole Canyon Watersheds.
It was found at seven of 18 developed sites and trails.
Maximum density observed was 270 stalks per square meter.
The highest elevation at which it was found was 8780 (Lehman Creek Trail).
Timothy was mainly observed along creek edges and in wet meadows.
At the end of the Osceola Ditch Trail, timothy was seen growing densely in two wet meadows covering an area of 1500 square meters.
In most of this area timothy provided 100% ground cover and was the only species present.
No treatment or monitoring of timothy has been done in GRBA.
CURLY DOCK
Rumex crispus
Curly dock is a stout perennial with a taproot.
These plants can become 1.6 m high and are relatively unbranched below the flowers.
The leaf margins are curled and wavy.
The basal leaves are 5-36 cm long and 2-12 cm wide.
The flowering portion at the top of the plant has many dense flower clusters.
There are six green sepals (three large and three small).
The flower stalk is at least as long as, or up to 1.5 times longer than, the larger sepals.
There are no petals.
As the flowers mature the innermost sepals develop into three papery wings, each with a swelling or growth.
One of the three growths is larger than the other two.
The three sepals that are approximately 3.5-6 mm long enclose a small dry 3-sided fruit.
Each plant produces 3,000 to 4,000 seeds.
Curly dock is a native of Eurasia.
It is found throughout the U.S. and Canada.
It is found in open sites such as pastures, meadows, waste area and gardens and is especially common in disturbed mesic areas.
It is often associated with cattle grazing.
While R. crispus grows vigorously on moist soils, it is found on most soils including well and poorly drained, clay, loamy clay, fertile, and slightly acid soils.
However, curly dock is seldom found on acidic soils.
Wildlife and domestic livestock readily spread seeds through their droppings and on their coats and provide the disturbance in mesic areas necessary for seed germination.
Curly dock was found in 1998 in five of the seven, inventoried eastside watersheds: Baker Creek, Can Young Canyon, Lehman Creek, Snake Creek and Young Canyon.
R. crispus was found in five of 18 inventoried developed sites.
These sites are: Baker Creek Campground, Upper and Lower Lehman Campgrounds, Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive and the water intake area for the Visitor Center.
In 1999, it was located in Strawberry Creek Watershed.
Numerous patches were encountered, all located in mesic areas, particularly in wet meadows, but also along stream banks and in roadside ditches.
It is estimated that there are hundreds of small patches located in the eastside watersheds alone.
Population size ranges from one or two plants to 100.
Density ranges from negligible to 15 per square meter.
Areal extent of single populations ranged from one to 900 square meters and possibly larger.
There are no records of any previous treatment or monitoring.
COMMON MULLEIN
Verbascum thapsus
Verbascum thapsus is a biennial, perennial or, rarely, an annual with a deep tap root.
In its first year it produces a low vegetative rosette up to 60 cm in diameter which overwinters and is followed in the succeeding growing season by a stout flowering stem 5-18 dm tall.
The basal leaves are oblong-obovate to obovate-lanceolate and 10-40 cm long including the petiole.
The flower stem is longitudinally ridged by the bases of decurrent leaves and is densely woolly with branched hairs.
Cauline leaves are elliptic-lanceolate, decurrent, and gradually reduced up the stem.
Verbascum thapsus is native to Europe and Asia (Semenza et al. 1978).
It was probably introduced into North America several times as a medicinal herb.
It was introduced in the mid-1700s to Virginia as a piscicide (fish poison) and spread rapidly.
It quickly became so well established that an 1818 flora of the East Coast described it as being a native.
By 1839 it had spread as far as Michigan (Gross and Werner 1978).
It was widely naturalized on the Pacific Coast by 1876 (Brewer et al. 1876).
The presence of common mullein is indicative of continual disturbance.
Mullein is common along roadsides or in riparian areas where disturbance can be an annual event.
Seeds can be transported by vehicles spotting on road shoulders.
Mullein was found in six of eight eastside watersheds.
These were: Baker Creek, Lehman Creek, Snake Creek, Kious Basin, Mill Creek and Can Young Canyon Watersheds.
Mullein was observed in seven of 18 developed sites and trails.
One dense patch was found in a wetland, in Baker Creek Watershed near the resurgence from Model Cave.
In 1998 the patch measured 15m by 15m, with 250 plants counted (basal rosettes and flowering stalks).
Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare) was also found in this area.
There are estimated to be more than one hundred separate populations in the eight inventoried watersheds, covering an areal extent of less than one hectare.
During the summers of 1993-95, YCC volunteers in the hand-pulling of mullein plants along the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive and in the field below the Visitors Center.
The field, which is now sagebrush/cheatgrass, was previously an alfalfa field.
No monitoring was done.
There is no mullein now growing in this field, although the seed bank, no doubt, is present.
2.2 Vegetative Resources
Great Basin National Park encompasses a wide variety of plant communities distributed over 8000 vertical feet of relief.
Plant communities found along this elevation gradient range from 1) desert scrub in the lowest valleys, 2) sagebrush-bunchgrass grass steppe, 3) pinyon-juniper woodland, 4) mixed conifer forest (spruce-fir-pine), 5) high-elevation pine forest and woodland, and 6) krummholz forest and alpine tundra.
Other, less extensive, plant communities such as aspen stands, relict ponderosa pine groves, and montane grasslands add to the great spatial heterogeneity of the South Snake Range ecosystem.
The many riparian habitats in the park, whether linear features (streams) or point features (springs, wet meadows), harbor species uncommon in the generally arid Great Basin and are especially important components of landscape diversity.
Over 760 plant species have been documented from the Snake Range and surrounding valleys.
The current isolation, yet ecologically recent connectedness, of the central Basin and Range province from the large montane habitat "mainlands" of the Sierra and the Colorado Cordillera, has resulted in a high degree of population disjunction, rarity, and endemism among plant species here.
The presence of limestone-derived soils at several elevations in the South Snake Range, and the extreme diversity of habitats caused by large topographic variance, also contributes to the locally high plant diversity.
2.3 Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources.
Great Basin National Park lists 22 rare, threatened, or sensitive plant species occurring the Snake Range and surrounding valleys.
Seven of these species are listed as rare, threatened, or sensitive by the Nevada Natural Heritage Program (NNHP) and have been confirmed to occur within park boundaries.
Many of the remaining 15 GRBA-sensitive plant species are likely to occur in the park but have not yet been documented.
No federally listed threatened or endangered plants are known to occur in the South Snake Range.
Rare and sensitive species with the highest potential to be affected by Integrated Pest Management activities (or lack thereof) are:
Mt. Wheeler sandwort (Arenaria congesta var. wheelerensis)
Globally secure intermountain species.
Endemic subspecies wheelerensis is critically rare in Nevada, occurring only in the Snake Range.
Listed on the NNNPS watch-list; listed (G5S1?) by the NNHP.
Presence in park confirmed, although GRBA herbarium collections contain no subspecific taxonomy and only a few locations in GRBA have been documented.
Alpine and subalpine environments.
Threatened by livestock grazing and recreational use of alpine areas.
Tunnel Springs beardtongue (Penstemon concinnus)
Rare and local native species.
In Nevada, occurs only in a few ranges, including the Snake Range.
Listed in Table 1 of the GMP as a sensitive species; region 4 USDA Forest Service sensitive species; USFWS species of concern; designated a Nevada Special Status Species by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM); on the NNNPS watch-list; listed (G3S2) by NNHP.
Presence in park confirmed.
Gravelly, mid-elevation alluvial slopes with sagebrush and pinyon-juniper.
Threats include livestock grazing, development, and competition from exotic plants, e.g. cheat grass, spotted knapweed.

Listed in Table 1 of the GMP as a sensitive species; on the NNNPS watch-list; listed (G3S2) by the NNHP.
Presence in the park confirmed.
Occurs in dry, rocky alpine and subalpine slopes, alpine meadows, and associated with middle and upper elevation aspen stands.
Some location and abundance data exist for GRBA, but the sub-specific taxonomy of GRBA herbarium specimens is questionable.
Threatened by livestock grazing, exotic plant invasion, and the decline of aspen stands park-wide.
Synonymous with P. francisci-pennellii.
Pennells whitlowgrass (Draba pennellii)
Rare, local native species.
Endemic to White Pine County, Nevada, specifically the Schell Creek Range.

In Nevada, limited to Baker area in White Pine County.
Protected as a cactus in Nevada.
Presence in park unconfirmed, but occurs in lower elevations below park boundary.
Rocky flats and hillsides with Atriplex, Artemesia, and pinyon-juniper, generally below 7000 feet.
Potential threats include livestock grazing, development, and illegal harvest by cactus merchants.
Intermountain wavewing (Cymopterus basalticus)
Rare and local native species.
Endemic to western Utah and White Pine County areas.
Listed in Table 1 of the GMP as a sensitive species; on the NNNPS watch-list; listed (G2G3S1) by NNHP.
Presence in the park unconfirmed, but possible.
Low and mid-elevation sagebrush and pinyon-juniper communities.
No information on the status, location, demography or ecology of this species exists for GRBA.
Potential threats include livestock grazing development (construction, road improvements), and competition from exotic plants.

Globally secure native species occurring in region, but relatively rare in west-central Nevada.
De-listed by the NNNPS; on the NNHP watch-list.
Presence in the park confirmed.
Cliffs, rock outcrops, generally dry sites across a wide elevation range.
Some location data exist for GRBA.
Potential threats include livestock grazing.
Synonymous with Haplopappus watsonii.
White checkermallow (Sidalcea candida)
Globally secure species, uncommon in Nevada.
The NNHP de-listed this species after 1991.
It is apparently more common than was once believed.
Presence in park confirmed.
Wet meadows and streambanks, mid-elevations.
GRBA populations threatened by development and competition from exotic plants, e.g. thistles, knapweed.

De-listed by the NNNPS; on the NNHP watch-list.
Presence in the South Snake Range confirmed.
Occurs on dry alkaline soils and with pinyon-juniper at middle elevations.
Potential threats include livestock grazing, development (construction, road improvements) and encroachment of non-native plants into pinyon-juniper communities.
Synonymous with Haplopappus nutallii var. depressus.
2.4 Wildlife Resources
A total of 72 mammals are known to occur or potentially occur in the park and on the administrative site in Baker, Nevada.
Two hundred and thirty eight species of birds have been seen and documented in the Snake Range and Snake Valley.
These species are dependent on native plant and animal communities for cover and forage.
Over time, nonnative plants out compete and replace native plants.
This decreases the diversity, quantity, and quality of forage and the habitat carrying capacity is reduced.
This also affects insect populations and the effects can cascade through out the food chain.
As native herbaceous vegetation is lost to nonnative plants ground cover for ground-nesting birds also becomes limited.
Taken together, these can result in a complete loss of wildlife from an area.
Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis)
Locally rare native species extirpated from GRBA in the early 1900s.
Presence confirmed in park due to reintroduction efforts of Nevada Department of Wildlife before park establishment.
Dependant upon native plant communities but may eat introduced grasses.
Elk (Cervus elaphus)
Locally rare native species in eastern Nevada extirpated by 1900.
Currently reestablishing in the northern portion of the park from introduced herds to the Schell Creek Range, 15 miles west of GRBA.
There are strong social-political concerns from local agricultural communities due to potential depredation and forage competition with livestock.
Also, elk is a popular big game animal for sportsmen who are advocating establishment of a viable herd to provide hunting opportunities adjacent to the park.
Dependant upon native plant communities but may eat introduced grasses.
Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus)
Common native species in Nevada.
Mule deer populations are sensitive to climate and range vegetative conditions making them excellent indicator species of range trends and management.
Mule deer are also important aesthetically to park visitors and as a big game animal for sportsmen adjacent to the park.
Depredation in local agricultural communities is of concern.
Dependant upon native plant communities but may eat introduced grasses.
2.5 Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive wildlife resources
Forty-four species of rare and/or sensitive animal species occur in or near Great Basin National Park and could be threatened by nonnative species.
Large ungulates and those species that are downward trending have the most potential to be impacted by nonnative plant infestation in the near future.
These include:
Spotted Bat (Euderma maculatum)
Locally rare native species; species is endemic to the park or local vicinity, listed in Table 1 of the GMP as a sensitive species; Region 4 USDA Forest Sensitive species; US Fish and Wildlife Service sensitive species; protected under Nevada state law; and listed as critically imperiled by the Nature Conservancy Nevada Natural Heritage Program.
Presence confirmed in park.
This species feeds primarily on moths, which tend to be host plant specific and thus sensitive to nonnative plant competition.
Mexican Free-Tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana)
Locally rare native species; species is considered endemic to the park or local vicinity; and is listed by Nature Conservancy Natural Heritage Program as globally secure.
Presence unconfirmed in park although known to roost in Guano Cave just outside of the park boundary.
Known to fly several miles to feed making most of the northern end of the park critical habitat.
This species feeds primarily on moths, which tend to be host plant specific and thus sensitive to nonnative plant competition.
Fringed Myotis (Myotis thysanodes thysanodes)
Locally rare native species; species is considered endemic to the park or local vicinity, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sensitive species; and is state listed by the Nature Conservancy Nevada Natural Heritage Program as imperiled.
Presence unconfirmed in park but they are insectivorous and depend upon native plant communities.
Long-Eared Myotis (Myotis evotis evotis)
Locally rare native species; species is endemic to the park or local vicinity, US Fish and Wildlife Service sensitive species; and state listed by the Nature Conservancy Nevada Natural Heritage Program as apparently secure.
Presence confirmed in park.
They are insectivorous and depend upon native plant communities.
Long-Legged Myotis (Myotis volans interior)
Locally rare native species; species is endemic to the park or local vicinity; US Fish and Wildlife Service sensitive species; and is state listed by the Nature Conservancy Nevada Natural Heritage Program as apparently secure.
Presence confirmed in park.
They are insectivorous and depend upon native plant communities.
Silver-Haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans)
Locally rare native species; species is endemic to the park or local vicinity and is state listed by the Nature Conservancy Nevada Natural Heritage Program as vulnerable to extinction.
Presence unconfirmed in park.
They are insectivorous and depend upon native plant communities.
Townsends Big-Eared Bat (Corynorhinus townsendii)
Locally uncommon native species; species is endemic to the park or local vicinity; US Fish and Wildlife Service sensitive species, Region 4 USDA Forest sensitive species; and is state listed by the Nature Conservancy Nevada Natural Heritage Program as vulnerable to extinction.

Dependant on native plant communities.
2.4 Water resources
Natural resource management objectives identified in the GMP, 1993, are:
Maintain the pristine quality of the air, water, geologic and scenic resources in the park.
a.
Establish a baseline to determine resource conditions, monitor changes, and identify sources of change; eliminate or mitigate any human-caused caused impacts that threaten biotic and scenic park resources.
b. Restore previously disturbed and abandoned areas (sites of mining activity, undesignated roads and trails, etc.) to natural conditions.
Ten permanent streams originate in the Park between 6,200 and 11,000 feet elevation and are fed by numerous springs along their courses.
The streams average five miles in length.
Five alpine lakes averaging three acres in size also exist, two of which support nonnative introduced salmonid populations.
Five streams flow eastward into Snake Valley, and five drain westward into Spring Valley.
There are thirteen major drainages in the Park..
The largest streams (Snake; Williams; Pine; Ridge; Lehman, Big Wash; and Baker Creek) originate from the Baker/Wheeler/Washington Peak areas.
There are also over 70 significant seeps and springs within the park.
Water from streams is diverted below the park boundary for domestic and agricultural usage.
Human consumption of waters by downstream residents, some without water treatment, are the chief domestic usage.
The remaining water is used for livestock consumption and irrigation purposes.
Five developed park campgrounds are located in the riparian corridors.
The campgrounds do not receive any of the potable water offered from the stream.
Backcountry hikers could use water directly from the stream for consumption, cooking and bathing.
2.5 Visitors
Nonnative plants are continually introduced to our lands and waters.
Preventing the introduction of nonnative plants is the first line of defense in protecting ecosystems from degradation.
It is also the most economical and efficient means of management.
Seeds, plants and plant parts may be introduced via air or water, domestic and wild animals, earth fill, construction equipment, stock feed and visitors.
Park visitors may unwittingly transport plant parts in the undercarriage or doors of their vehicles, in tire treads, pets coats, soles of shoes and clothing.
Established park populations of nonnative plants are able to spread through these same routes.
In 1999 GRBA had over 90,000 visitors.
Many of these visitors stop, park and have a picture taken by the entrance sign.
This area contains one of the largest and most diverse concentrations of nonnative plants at GRBA.
CHAPTER 3
ALTERNATIVES
3.1 ACTIONS COMMON TO ALL BUT THE NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE
Prevention of Invasion into Park
Objectives: 1.
Prevent the spread of existing populations of nonnative plants in the park.
2.
Reduce or eliminate existing populations of nonnative plants in the park 3.
Prevent the invasion of any new species of nonnative plants into the park.
Park Prevention Program
Actions: * Require inspection of contractors equipment and materials to prevent importation of nonnative seeds into the park.
* Ensure all feeds used on parklands are free of invasive nonnative plant material (certified weed-seed-free).
* Develop an early warning system to identify and treat new infestations of nonnative plants in the park.
Train appropriate personnel to identify invasive nonnative plants.
* Implement "Best Management Practices" for ground-disturbing activities.
* Ensure all materials used in revegetation projects on parklands, including organic fertilizers and plant materials, are free of nonnative plant seeds or materials.
* Use locally grown native plant materials where available in all appropriate vegetation projects.
Park Guidelines
Actions: * Incorporate Best Management Practices in all appropriate project proposals, including planning/design, maintenance, fire, construction, and resource management.
* Require park residents to consult with resource management when planning landscaping projects.
Education of Visitors, Park Employees and Contractors
Preventing the invasion of nonnatives depends on an active and informed public and workforce.
A workforce skilled in the principles and techniques of nonnative plant management is a critical component of effective prevention and management.
Contractors and concessionaires must also understand the influence their actions have on park resources.
Objectives: 1.
Educate park employees on invasive nonnative plant issues and identification 2.
Educate visitors on invasive nonnative plant issues and identification 3.
Increase public awareness about the threats of nonnative plants
Actions: * Run a nonnative plant issues and identification training module for seasonal interpretive rangers.
* Include materials on issues and identification in seasonal interpretive ranger handbook.
Set up protocol for reporting newly found nonnative infestations.
* Include an article in the park newspaper discussing invasive nonnative plant issues and the work being done to manage them.
* Encourage interpretive rangers to develop campfire programs that include nonnative issues, and provide support for such programs.
* Develop an information sheet for horseback riders, packers, and others bringing stock into the park about nonnative issues and invasion prevention measures.
Include information on where to obtain certified weed-free hay.
Inventory and Monitoring
Inventories provide baseline information on presence, distribution, and size of nonnative plant populations.
Inventories also provide essential information for planning, budgeting, and setting priorities for treatment of nonnative species.
Regular monitoring will enable personnel to identify nonnative plant encroachments to take effective action.
Monitoring programs also will be used to measure the effectiveness of general and specific management efforts.
Objectives: 1.
Assess the presence, distribution, and density of high and medium urgency nonnative plants.
2.
Assess the presence and distribution of all other nonnative plants.
3.
Rank watersheds in terms of diversity and density of nonnative plant populations.
4.
Obtain and file plant identification reference materials (plant specimens and photos).
Actions: * Establish fixed point transects for assessment of presence and density of nonnatives.
* Inventory nonnatives.
Summarize by watershed and by established site.
* Establish implementation-monitoring protocols for site-specific monitoring during construction, habitat manipulation, and other activities with high risk of increasing nonnative plant infestations.
* Establish effectiveness monitoring protocols to assess the reduction of the targeted plants and the restoration of native plants and animals.
* Establish and continually update a GIS map showing locations of high and medium nonnative plant species, increase or decrease in population size, and type of controls used.
An inventory of nonnative plants in seven watersheds on the east side of the park was completed in 1999.
Fixed point transects were established in these watersheds to assess density of nonnative plants.
The same protocol will be followed to complete future inventory and monitoring.
Management of Nonnative Invasive Plants
All of the developed sites with 10 or more of the target species present are considered important candidates for treatment.
Among these sites, prioritization is based on amount of visitor and employee utilization that could increase the rate of spread into other areas.
1.
Visitor Center 2.
Baker Creek Trailhead 3.
Route 488 (at park entrance) 4.
Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive 5.
Upper Lehman Campground 6.
Lower Lehman Campground 7.
Residential Area 8.
Baker Creek Road 9.
Strawberry Creek Campsites 10.
Baker Creek Campground 11.
Snake Creek Campsites
Priorities for treatment have been divided into three phases that may be implemented according to available funding.
Phase 1 activities are considered extremely urgent.
Adaptive Management
Under the principles of adaptive management, new management techniques should be treated as experimental and evaluated and adjusted accordingly.
Biologists, ecologists, and resource managers should gather sound scientific information, use the information to develop management techniques, monitor the results of the management activities, determine if clearly stated objectives are being met, and modify activities as needed.
Actions: * Test alternative methods of reducing nonnative plant density and of eradicating populations.
Best Management Practices
This section lists best management practices.
Based upon the selected preferred alternative implemented some or all could apply.
1) Vegetate and reseed areas following ground-disturbing activities with a native seed mix
2) Mulch recently disturbed sites to degrade suit suitability for invasion of annual nonnative plant species.
3) Implement standards for equipment cleaning and sterility to prevent unintentional spread of invasive plant propagules.
Require inspection of contractors equipment and materials to prevent importation of nonnative seeds into the park.
4) Carefully research plant community ecology and biology to minimize negative effects of control methods (mowing, hand pulling) on native plants.
5) Develop policy to ensure all feeds used on parklands are free of invasive nonnative plant material (certified weed-seed-free).
6) Develop an early warning system to identify and treat new infestations of nonnative plants in the park.
Train appropriate personnel to identify invasive nonnative plants.
7) Require that all materials used in revegetation projects on parklands, including organic fertilizers and plant materials, are free of nonnative plant seeds or materials.
8) Use locally grown native plant materials where available in all appropriate vegetation projects.
9) Do not use herbicides near populations of sensitive native plants.
Inventory all sites for sensitive plant species prior to chemical controls.
10) Use herbicides that have been label by the EPA to be safe for use near aquatic systems.
Application of herbicides would not occur within 10 yards of live water sources.
11) Chemical control materials should be handled, stored, mixed, applied, and disposed of properly in accordance with Federal law.
All projects involving herbicides should be supervised or performed by Nevada-licensed pesticide applicators.
3.2 Alternative 1 - No action
Under this alternative no IPM plan would be developed and no actions to contain and control the spread of nonnative plants would occur apart from what has been performed in the past as described in the nonnative plant baseline Section 2.1.
3.3 Alternative 2 - Mechanical Control
An essential part of an integrated pest management plan for nonnative plants is treatment of individual plants and populations to reduce or eradicate the infestation.
Under this alternative only mechanical methods would be used.
Mechanical treatments include hand pulling of individual plants, mowing, and cutting and removal of flower-bearing parts.
Mechanical treatment is a viable option for scattered individual plants or in areas where other controls techniques are not recommended.
It can cause soil disturbance and is labor/time intensive.
In some cases, because of the difficulty of removing rootstocks from compact or rocky soil, it can be ineffective.
Objectives: 1. Use mechanical treatment in all areas of nonnatives high and medium urgency nonnative plant infestation to remove individuals and prevent the seed base from expanding.
Multiyear Actions:
Phase I: * Treat and monitor high urgency species in all areas (spotted knapweed, bull thistle, musk thistle, field bindweed, Russian thistle).
* B. Treat and monitor top three ranked sites (Visitor Center, Baker Creek Trailhead Route 488)
Phase II: * A. Continue to treat and monitor high urgency species in all areas.
* B. Continue to treat and monitor top three ranked sites.
* C. Treat and monitor fourth through seventh ranked developed sites (Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, Upper and Lower Lehman campgrounds, and the residential area) * D. Survey more drainages for nonnative plant species
Phase III: * A. Continue to treat and monitor high urgency species in all areas.
* B. Continue to treat and monitor top seven ranked sites.
* C. Treat and monitor eighth through eleventh ranked developed sites (Baker Creek road, Strawberry Creek Campsites, Baker Creek Campground, Snake Creek Campsites)
Treatments for High Urgency Species.
MUSK THISTLE
Carduus nutans
Management Objectives:
1.
Prevent the areal spread of musk thistle from the sides of Snake Creek Road between primitive campsites 6 and 7 by 2005.
2.
Prevent the areal spread of musk thistle from its present locations in Upper Lehman Campground from by 2005.
3.
Reduce the number of stems in the Upper Lehman Campground and Strawberry Creek populations by 50% by 2005.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
All second-year plants found in the Upper Lehman Campground and Snake Creek Road populations will be hand-cut at the base of the stalk on a yearly bases.
Plant parts will be removed and disposed of.
A follow-up will be done in late June to catch and treat any missed plants and to assess the effectiveness of the mechanical treatments.
A second follow up will be done after flowering.
Plants found at this time will be hand-cut, and parts removed and incinerated.
For monitoring purposes, the areal extent of the populations will be mapped, and every second-year plant found will be counted.
All plants found will be counted and mapped using a Trimble GPS unit.
Areal extent will be estimated.
Then these plants will be hand cut; plant parts will be removed and incinerated.
In 2003, plants will be allowed to bolt and then counted and cut prior to anthesis.
Thus, the effect of the treatment will be assessed.
SPOTTED KNAPWEED
Centaurea maculosa
Management Objectives:
1.
To contain the following populations of spotted knapweed in GRBA by 2005: Baker Creek Trailhead, Visitor Center Parking Lot, VC Picnic Area Restrooms, Residential Area, Lower Strawberry, Upper Strawberry.
2.
To decrease the density by at least 50% by 2005 of the following populations of spotted knapweed: Upper Orchard, Lower Orchard, Road to VC Picnic Area and Route 488.
3.
To prevent the areal spread of the Route 488 population of spotted knapweed.
4.
Inventory all sites for sensitive plant species prior to chemical controls.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
All populations of knapweed will be treated with mechanical means such as have pulling, mowing along road shoulders and with weed whackers.
The extent of infestation of the Route 488, Baker Creek Trailhead and Strawberry Creek populations will be measured and monitored annually with permanent photo plots and areal measurements.
Exact plant counts of the Baker Creek Trailhead and Strawberry Creek populations will be accomplished annually.
In the Route 488 population permanent line transects will be established so that stem density can be measured.
Technicians on foot will survey prime potential areas of infestation annually.
These prime areas include: all developed campgrounds, the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, the Visitor Center grounds and parking area, Route 488, the VC picnic area, and Baker Creek Road.
All knapweed populations (one plant or more, "populations" must be separated by 10 m or more) encountered will be mapped using a GPS unit.
Separate stems will be counted, and areal extent estimated.
All new plants found will be hand-pulled.
Maintenance personnel will be encouraged to continue with ad hoc mechanical treatment measures.
Since they patrol most of the high visitor use areas during their various jobs, this is an excellent way to catch flowering plants that were missed during the rosette stage.
In order to monitor the effect of their work, a nonnative plant report form will be distributed (Appendix ***).
Interpretive rangers will be trained in the identification of knapweed and other nonnatives and encouraged to report observations as well.
BULL THISTLE
Cirsium vulgare
Management Objectives:
1.
Decrease the density of the Baker Creek Trailhead, Lower Lehman Campground and Water Intake populations of bull thistle in GRBA by 50% by 2005.
2.
Decrease the density of the Model Cave Upsurge and Lower Lehman Campground populations of bull thistle in GRBA by 2005.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
In 1999, all known populations of bull thistle will be mapped with a GPS unit and hand-cut at the base of the stalk prior to anthesis.
Areal extent and density was calculated.
The primary method of treatment on all populations of bull thistle will be mechanical.
Plants will be hand-cut at the base of the stalk.
Several populations will be monitored annually using frequency plots to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
In 2005, all bull thistle populations will again be mapped using a GPS unit and areal extent determined for trend analyses with 1999 data.
FIELD BINDWEED
Convolvulus arvensis

2.
Prevent the spread and reduce the density of the following six populations of bindweed in GRBA by 2005: Residential Area-3 Pack; Scenic Drive-F071420H (west corner of Scenic Drive and entrance road to Lower Lehman Campground, F071420C (0.8 mi from Rt. 488 junction), F071420C (north corner of Scenic Drive and maintenance area turnoff) and F071421A (downhill side of road between Upper and Lower Lehman Campgrounds).
Alpha-numeric codes refer to differentially corrected GPS location files.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
Treatment will involve hand.
Presence/absence will be ascertained in all developed sites.
And, the areal extent of known populations will be measured annually.
3.4 Alternative 3 - Mechanical/Chemical Control
Under this alternative a combination of mechanical and chemical controls will be used.
Mechanical treatments are described under Alternative 2.
Application of chemical herbicide to individual plants is an efficient and safe way to treat nonnative plants in areas of medium and high density.
Spot application of herbicides by a certified herbicide applicator causes the least disturbance to areas if done correctly.
Herbicide application will consist of individual plant basal treatment to reduce the potential for overspray and drift that would harm native plants.
No application of any herbicide not EPA registered and approved for use near aquatic ecosystems will occur within 10 yards of live waters.
Only EPA registered herbicides, the least toxic products know to be effective for the target species will be used.
All applications will be conducted under the direction of a Nevada State licensed and NPS trained applicator.
All standard protection equipment will be used.
All safety equipment to prevent exposure to applicators will be required.
This will include:
a.
Kleenguard or similar brand of disposable coveralls. b. OSHA/NIOSH/MSHA approved respirators. c. Protective chemical splash goggles d. 22mil Nitrile safety gloves e. 16inch rubber safety boots.
f.
At all times a pesticide decontamination kit will be on-site and readily available.
Objectives: 1. Use mechanical treatment in areas of low density of nonnatives, or where chemical application is not recommended (near live waters) to remove individuals and prevent the seed base from expanding.
1. Use chemical treatment in areas of mid to high density to remove individuals and prevent the seed base from expanding.
3) No application of any herbicide not EPA registered and approved for use near aquatic ecosystems
will occur within 10 yards of live waters.

Treatments for High Urgency Species.
MUSK THISTLE
Carduus nutans
Management Objectives:
1) Prevent the areal spread of musk thistle from the sides of Snake Creek Road between primitive campsites 6 and 7 by 2005.
2) Prevent the areal spread of musk thistle from its present locations in Upper Lehman Campground from by 2005.
3) Reduce the number of stems in the Upper Lehman Campground and Strawberry Creek populations by 50% by 2005.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
All second-year plants found in the Upper Lehman Campground and Snake Creek Road populations will be hand-cut at the base of the stalk.
Plant parts will be removed and disposed.
An EPA approved and registered herbicides will be spot-applied to plants under the supervision of a NPS certified and State of Nevada licensed applicator in both populations while they are still in the rosette stage (May or early June).
A follow-up will be done in late June to catch and treat any missed plants and to assess the effectiveness of the herbicide.
A second follow up will be done after flowering.
Plants found at this time will be hand-cut, and parts removed and incinerated.
For monitoring purposes, the areal extent of the populations will be mapped, and every second-year plant found will be counted.
All plants found will be counted and mapped using a Trimble GPS unit.
Areal extent will be estimated.
Then these plants will be hand cut; plant parts will be removed and incinerated.
In 2003, herbicides will not be applied in the spring; plants will be allowed to bolt and then counted and cut prior to anthesis.
Thus, the effect of the herbicide application will be assessed.
SPOTTED KNAPWEED
Centaurea maculosa
Management Objectives:
1) To contain and or eradicate the following populations of spotted knapweed in GRBA by 2005: Baker Creek Trailhead, Visitor Center Parking Lot, VC Picnic Area Restrooms, Residential Area, Lower Strawberry, Upper Strawberry.
2) To decrease the density by at least 50% by 2005 of the following populations of spotted knapweed: Upper Orchard, Lower Orchard, Road to VC Picnic Area and Route 488.
3) To prevent the areal spread of the Route 488 population of spotted knapweed.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
Spotted knapweed is very aggressive.
Treatment of this species is mandated by county and state agencies.
It is listed as noxious in Nevada and Utah.
Mechanical, chemical and biological treatment will be integrated to achieve the management objective.
All populations of knapweed will be treated with an EPA approved and registered herbicides spot-applied to individual plants under the supervision of a NPS certified and State of Nevada licensed applicator.
Clopyralid (TranslineÂ®) which only affects Asteraceae will be considered for us on Knapweed.
Chemical application will be done when plants are in the rosette stage; those missed will be treated during the flowering stage.
The extent of infestation of the Route 488, Baker Creek Trailhead and Strawberry Creek populations will be measured and monitored annually with permanent photo plots and areal measurements.
Exact plant counts of the Baker Creek Trailhead and Strawberry Creek populations will be accomplished annually.
In the Route 488 population permanent line transects will be established so that stem density can be measured.
Technicians on foot will survey prime potential areas of infestation annually.
These prime areas include: all developed campgrounds, the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, the Visitor Center grounds and parking area, Route 488, the VC picnic area, and Baker Creek Road.
All knapweed populations (one plant or more, "populations" must be separated by 10 m or more) encountered will be mapped using a GPS unit.
Separate stems will be counted, and areal extent estimated.
All new plants found will be hand-pulled or subjected to herbicide application.
Maintenance personnel will be encouraged to continue with ad hoc mechanical treatment measures.
Since they patrol most of the high visitor use areas during their various jobs, this is an excellent way to catch flowering plants that were missed during the rosette stage.
In order to monitor the effect of their work, a nonnative plant report form will be distributed (Appendix ***).
Interpretive rangers will be trained in the identification of knapweed and other nonnatives and encouraged to report observations as well.
BULL THISTLE
Cirsium vulgare
Management Objectives:
1) Decrease the density of the Baker Creek Trailhead, Lower Lehman Campground and Water Intake populations of bull thistle in GRBA by 50% by 2005.
2) Eradicate the Model Cave Upsurge and Lower Lehman Campground populations of bull thistle in GRBA by 2005.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
In 1999, all known populations of bull thistle will be mapped with a GPS unit and hand-cut at the base of the stalk prior to anthesis.
Areal extent and density was calculated.
The primary method of treatment on all populations of bull thistle, except the Water Intake population, will consist of individual spot applications on rosettes of an EPA approved and registered herbicide under the supervision of a NPS certified and State of Nevada licensed applicator.
These areas will be surveyed again later in the season to find flowering plants that were missed while in the rosette stage.
These plants will be hand-cut at the base of the stalk.
Several populations will be monitored annually using frequency plots to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
In 2005, all bull thistle populations will again be mapped using a GPS unit and areal extent determined for trend analyses with 1999 data.
Mechanical treatments will be the primary treat method for the Water Intake population.
FIELD BINDWEED
Convolvulus arvensis
Management Objectives:
1) Prevent/contain the spread of C. arvensis from the parking islands and orchard to other locations around the Visitors Center in GRBA by 2005.
2) Eradicate the following six populations of bindweed in GRBA by 2005: Residential Area-3 Pack; Scenic Drive-F071420H (west corner of Scenic Drive and entrance road to Lower Lehman Campground, F071420C (0.8 mi from Rt. 488 junction), F071420C (north corner of Scenic Drive and maintenance area turnoff) and F071421A (downhill side of road between Upper and Lower Lehman Campgrounds).
Alpha-numeric codes refer to differentially corrected GPS location files.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
C. arvensis is a troublesome and difficult species to eradicate due to its very extensive root system and seed longevity.
Nearby agricultural lands can provide a continuous source of reinvasion from seed dispersal.
Treatment will involve hand-pulling and application of an EPA approved and registered herbicides spot-applied to individual plants under the supervision of a NPS certified and State of Nevada licensed applicator to reduce plant vigor and seed production.
Monitoring will be done in two ways.
Presence/absence will be ascertained in all developed sites.
And, the areal extent of known populations will be measured annually.
Medium Urgency Species
COMMON TIMOTHY
Phleum pratense
Management Objectives:
1) Prevent the establishment of P. pratense after any human-caused ground-disturbing activities in GRBA.
2) Map and measure areal extent of all timothy populations larger than one hundred square meters and with a ground cover greater than 50% in east side watersheds in GRBA.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
The treatment of timothy is difficult.
Prevention of establishment of new populations of timothy is the best strategy.
This will be accomplished by revegetating and reseeding areas following ground-disturbing activities.
These areas will then be monitored for the presence/absence of P. pratense and small patches hand-pulled.
Patches of timothy greater than an estimated one hundred square meters in area and with a ground cover greater than 50% in east side watersheds will be mapped using GPS technology.
The intent is that this information will be used for comparison to similar measurements taken to monitor areal spread.
CURLY DOCK
Rumex crispus
Management Objective:
1) Reduce the number of flowering stalks of R. crispus by 50% in the following four developed sites in GRBA.
Baker Creek, Upper and Lower Lehman Campgrounds; and the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
Seedheads will be removed before plant comes to fruit.
Repeated treatments will be necessary.
Cattle spread seeds through their droppings and on their coats and provide the disturbance in mesic areas necessary for seed germination.
It is expected that the cessation of cattle grazing in the park (scheduled for 2000) will reduce R. crispus.
This species will be monitored to analyze the effects of the removal of cattle from the park.
It is critical that no treatment be done in areas selected for monitoring.
Thus, no treatment will be done outside of developed sites.
Monitoring will be done by counting the number of plants and flowering stalks treated every year, and by assessing the number of locations where curly dock is found in the four aforementioned developed sites.
COMMON MULLEIN
Verbascum thapsus
Management Objectives:
1.
To preserve the "native look" of roadsides by cutting all V. thapsus plants found during annual monitoring of roadsides and developed sites (Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, Baker Creek Road, Route 488, Visitor Center, Residential Area, all campgrounds) from 1999 to 2005.
Of more concern are dense populations of mullein found in mesic areas such as the Model Cave population.
The second objective is: 2.
To reduce the area covered by common mullein in the Model Cave population by 50% from 1999 to 2005.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
Common mullein will be hand-cut at the base of the stalk in July or August during annual monitoring of roadsides and developed sites.
The areal extent of the Model Cave population will be measured annually.
The total number of second year plants will be counted.
This population will not be cut as it is assumed that the cessation of cattle grazing within the park is expected to cause the reduction of common mullein since the annual disturbance necessary for its persistence will be removed.
3.5 Alternative 4 - Mechanical/Chemical/Biological Control
Under this alternative a combination of mechanical, chemical, and biological controls will be used.
Mechanical treatments are described under Alternative 2.
Chemical treatments are described under alternative 3.
Biological treatment involves the release of host-specific predators or pathogens (insects, bacteria, fungi) that are natural enemies of the host plant.
Insects reduce nonnative plant populations in a variety of ways including feeding on the plant and killing it or diminishing its vigor, and planting eggs in seedheads to reduce reproductive potential.
As the nonnative plant population decreases, so does the insect population.
Insects utilized for control are introduced from the host plants area of origin, thus are also nonnatives.
They have been subjected to vigorous study to ascertain that they attack only the nonnative plant of concern.
This option is viable for dense monospecific infestations.
It often takes several years for the insects to establish themselves and have a visible impact on the plant population.
Using biological controls along with chemical and mechanical control is the most effective long term method to reduce and eliminate nonnative plant populations.
Insects utilized for treatment are introduced from the host plants area of origin, thus are also nonnatives.
They have been subjected to vigorous study to ascertain that they attack only the nonnative plant of concern.
This option is viable for dense infestations.
It often takes years for the insects to establish themselves and have a visible impact on the plant population.
Many organizations suggest using biological treatment along with chemical or mechanical treatment to implement an effective IPM plan.
The following insects are recommended for control of spotted knapweed: Larinus minutus, Urophora affinis, and Urophora quadrifasciata.
The following insects are recommended for control of musk thistle: Rhinocyllus conicus, trichosirocalus and Cassida rubiginosa.
Objectives:
1) Use mechanical treatment in areas of low density of nonnatives, or where chemical application is not recommended (near live waters) to remove individuals and prevent the seed base from expanding.
2) Use chemical treatment in areas of mid to high density to remove individuals and prevent the seed base from expanding.
3) Use biological controls in areas of high density to remove individuals, decrease the vigor of plants, and to prevent the seed base from expanding.
Multiyear Actions:

Treatments for High Urgency Species
MUSK THISTLE
Carduus nutans
Management Objectives:
1) Prevent the areal spread of musk thistle from the sides of Snake Creek Road between primitive campsites 6 and 7 by 2005.
2) Prevent the areal spread of musk thistle from its present locations in Upper Lehman Campground by 2005.
3) Reduce the number of stems in the Upper Lehman Campground and Strawberry Creek populations by 50% by 2005.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
All second-year plants found in the Upper Lehman Campground and Snake Creek Road populations will be hand-cut at the base of the stalk.
Plant parts will be removed and disposed.
An EPA approved and registered herbicides will be spot-applied to plants under the supervision of a NPS certified and State of Nevada licensed applicator in both populations while they are still in the rosette stage (May or early June).
A follow-up will be done in late June to catch and treat any missed plants and to assess the effectiveness of the herbicide.
A second follow up will be done after flowering.
Plants found at this time will be hand-cut, and parts removed and incinerated.
For monitoring purposes, the areal extent of the populations will be mapped, and every second-year plant found will be counted.
All plants found will be counted and mapped using a Trimble GPS unit.
Areal extent will be estimated.
Then these plants will be hand cut; plant parts will be removed and incinerated.
In 2003, herbicides will not be applied in the spring; plants will be allowed to bolt and then counted and cut prior to anthesis.
Thus, the effect of the herbicide application will be assessed.
SPOTTED KNAPWEED
Centaurea maculosa
Management Objectives:
1) To contain and or eradicate the following populations of spotted knapweed in GRBA by 2005: Baker Creek Trailhead, Visitor Center Parking Lot, VC Picnic Area Restrooms, Residential Area, Lower Strawberry, Upper Strawberry.
2) To decrease the density by at least 50% by 2005 of the following populations of spotted knapweed: Upper Orchard, Lower Orchard, Road to VC Picnic Area and Route 488.
3) To establish viable populations of the bio control insects Larinus minutus, Urophora affinis, and U. quadrifasciata in the Route 488 population of spotted knapweed in GRBA.
4) To prevent the areal spread of the Route 488 population of spotted knapweed.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
Spotted knapweed is very aggressive.
Treatment of this species is mandated by county and state agencies.
It is listed as noxious in Nevada and Utah.
Mechanical, chemical and biological treatment will be integrated to achieve the management objective.
All populations of knapweed will be treated with an EPA approved and registered herbicides spot-applied to individual plants under the supervision of a NPS certified and State of Nevada licensed applicator.
Clopyralid (TranslineÂ®) which affects only Asteraceae will be considered for us on Knapweed.
Chemical application will be done when plants are in the rosette stage; those missed will be treated during the flowering stage.
The extent of infestation of the Route 488, Baker Creek Trailhead and Strawberry Creek populations will be measured and monitored annually with permanent photo plots and areal measurements.
Exact plant counts of the Baker Creek Trailhead and Strawberry Creek populations will be accomplished annually.
In the Route 488 population permanent line transects will be established so that stem density can be measured.
Technicians on foot will survey prime potential areas of infestation annually.
These prime areas include: all developed campgrounds, the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, the Visitor Center grounds and parking area, Route 488, the VC picnic area, and Baker Creek Road.
All knapweed populations (one plant or more, "populations" must be separated by 10 m or more) encountered will be mapped using a GPS unit.
Separate stems will be counted, and areal extent estimated.
All new plants found will be hand-pulled or subjected to herbicide application.
Biological treatment agents will be released in July 1999.
Two units of a flowerhead weevil, Larinus minutus, will be released in the Route 488 population.
Two species of gall fly that attack seed capitula, Urophora affinis and U. quadrifasciata, also will be released.
They were successfully established by BLM at Sacramento Pass (Bob Wilson, NV Coop.
Ext. pers comm.).
Sticky traps and capitula dissection will be used annually to monitor insect populations, attack rates, and seed losses.
Standards set by Jeff Knight, the Nevada state entomologist, will be used to assess viability of insect populations.
More units of insects will be released annually if deemed necessary.
Maintenance personnel will be encouraged to continue with ad hoc mechanical treatment measures.
Since they patrol most of the high visitor use areas during their various jobs, this is an excellent way to catch flowering plants that were missed during the rosette stage.
In order to monitor the effect of their work, a nonnative plant report form will be distributed (Appendix ***).
Interpretive rangers will be trained in the identification of knapweed and other nonnatives and encouraged to report observations as well.
BULL THISTLE
Cirsium vulgare
Management Objectives:
1) Decrease the density of the Baker Creek Trailhead, Lower Lehman Campground and Water Intake populations of bull thistle in GRBA by 50% by 2005.
2) Establish a viable population of Urophora solstitialus on the Water Intake population of bull thistle from by 2005.
3) Eradicate the Model Cave Upsurge and Lower Lehman Campground populations of bull thistle in GRBA by 2005.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
In 1999, all known populations of bull thistle will be mapped with a GPS unit and hand-cut at the base of the stalk prior to anthesis.
Areal extent and density was calculated.
The primary method of treatment on all populations of bull thistle, except the Water Intake population, will consist of individual spot applications on rosettes of an EPA approved and registered herbicide under the supervision of a NPS certified and State of Nevada licensed applicator.
These areas will be surveyed again later in the season to find flowering plants that were missed while in the rosette stage.
These plants will be hand-cut at the base of the stalk.
Several populations will be monitored annually using frequency plots to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
In 2005, all bull thistle populations will again be mapped using a GPS unit and areal extent determined for trend analyses with 1999 data.
Mechanical treatments will be the primary treat method for the Water Intake population.
Urophora solstitialus, a biocontrol insect, will be released to contain outliers and missed plants, if a distribution source can be located.
FIELD BINDWEED
Convolvulus arvensis
Management Objectives:
1) Prevent/contain the spread of C. arvensis from the parking islands and orchard to other locations around the Visitors Center in GRBA by 2005.
2) Eradicate the following six populations of bindweed in GRBA by 2005: Residential Area-3 Pack; Scenic Drive-F071420H (west corner of Scenic Drive and entrance road to Lower Lehman Campground, F071420C (0.8 mi from Rt. 488 junction), F071420C (north corner of Scenic Drive and maintenance area turnoff) and F071421A (downhill side of road between Upper and Lower Lehman Campgrounds).
Alpha-numeric codes refer to differentially corrected GPS location files.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
C. arvensis is a troublesome and difficult species to eradicate due to its very extensive root system and seed longevity.
Nearby agricultural lands can provide a continuous source of reinvasion from seed dispersal.
Treatment will involve hand-pulling and application of an EPA approved and registered herbicides spot-applied to individual plants under the supervision of a NPS certified and State of Nevada licensed applicator to reduce plant vigor and seed production.
Monitoring will be done in two ways.
Presence/absence will be ascertained in all developed sites.
And, the areal extent of known populations will be measured annually.
Medium Urgency Species
COMMON TIMOTHY
Phleum pratense
Management Objectives:
1) Prevent the establishment of P. pratense after any human-caused ground-disturbing activities in GRBA.
2) Map and measure areal extent of all timothy populations larger than one hundred square meters and with a ground cover greater than 50% in east side watersheds in GRBA.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
The treatment of timothy is difficult.
Prevention of establishment of new populations of timothy is the best strategy.
This will be accomplished by revegetating and reseeding areas following ground-disturbing activities.
These areas will then be monitored for the presence/absence of P. pratense and small patches hand-pulled.
Patches of timothy greater than an estimated one hundred square meters in area and with a ground cover greater than 50% in east side watersheds will be mapped using GPS technology.
The intent is that this information will be used for comparison to similar measurements taken to monitor areal spread.
CURLY DOCK
Rumex crispus
Management Objective:
1) Reduce the number of flowering stalks of R. crispus by 50% in the following four developed sites in GRBA.
Baker Creek, Upper and Lower Lehman Campgrounds; and the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
Seedheads will be removed before plant comes to fruit.
Repeated treatments will be necessary.
Cattle spread seeds through their droppings and on their coats and provide the disturbance in mesic areas necessary for seed germination.
It is expected that the cessation of cattle grazing in the park (scheduled for 2000) will reduce R. crispus.
This species will be monitored to analyze the effects of the removal of cattle from the park.
It is critical that no treatment be done in areas selected for monitoring.
Thus, no treatment will be done outside of developed sites.
Monitoring will be done by counting the number of plants and flowering stalks treated every year, and by assessing the number of locations where curly dock is found in the four aforementioned developed sites.
COMMON MULLEIN
Verbascum thapsus
Management Objectives:
1) To preserve the "native look" of roadsides by cutting all V. thapsus plants found during annual monitoring of roadsides and developed sites (Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, Baker Creek Road, Route 488, Visitor Center, Residential Area, all campgrounds) from 1999 to 2005.
Of more concern are dense populations of mullein found in mesic areas such as the Model Cave population.
The second objective is:
3) To reduce the area covered by common mullein in the Model Cave population by 50% from 1999 to 2005.
Proposed Treatment and Monitoring:
Common mullein will be hand-cut at the base of the stalk in July or August during annual monitoring of roadsides and developed sites.
The areal extent of the Model Cave population will be measured annually.
The total number of second year plants will be counted.
This population will not be cut as it is assumed that the cessation of cattle grazing within the park is expected to cause the reduction of common mullein since the annual disturbance necessary for its persistence will be removed.

Environmental Consequences
4.1 ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action
Issue 1 Vegetative Resources
The consequences of implementing alternative one result in the continued spread of invasive exotic plants into the Great Basin National Park ecosystem.
Invasive, exotic plants are often more competitive than native species and can drive native plant populations to local, and sometimes regional extinction.
Increases in exotic plant abundance at the expense of native flora can result in decreased biodiversity and habitat diversity at both the local and landscape scale.
Plant communities most at risk for invasion and ecological degradation by exotic plants are sagebrush-bunchgrass and pinyon-juniper (being invaded by cheatgrass and knapweed) and riparian meadows (being invaded by thistles and knapweed).
Plant community changes brought about by the invasion and spread of exotic plants can cascade throughout the ecosystem and cause degradation in wildlife habitat and detrimental changes in physical processes instrumental in ecosystem health.
Proliferation of exotic species in the Intermountain West has caused changes in water infiltration and erosion rates leading to lowering of water tables and drying of springs and seeps and loss of critical riparian habitat.
Changes in fire regimes caused by the production of very fine, flashy fuels (cheatgrass) caused historically unprecedented large fires in Nevada in 1999.
The hot, fast nature of these fires favors re-establishment of exotic plants on these sites rather than the native shrubs and bunchgrasses thus perpetuating the unhealthy cycle.
Invasion of spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) into native sagebrush-bunchgrass communities can dramatically decrease native plant biomass and diversity, leading to decreases in wildlife habitat and forage quantity and quality and increased soil erosion.
The allopathic toxicity of knapweed contributes to long-term site degradation, even after knapweed plants have been successfully removed.
Implementation of the No Action alternative could also allow the uninterrupted invasion of new exotic species.
The ecological consequences of future invasions cannot be exactly known, but would most likely add to the negative ecosystem effects described above.
Issue-2 Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources.
Invasion of exotic plants can displace rare species and lead to local extinction.
Several populations of rare plants are threatened by increased expansion of non-native plants, particularly spotted knapweed.
For example the sensitive species Penstemon concinnus is known to inhabit pinyon-juniper habitats near knapweed infestations.
Adoption of the No Action alternative could allow knapweed to spread into these communities resulting in local extinction of this species.
Other rare plants in Great Basin National Park (Penstemon leiophyllus v. fransisci-pennellii, Arenaria congesta v. wheelerensis) are known to occur within several kilometers of current knapweed infestations.
Other species as yet undocumented in Great Basin National Park such as Machaeranthera grindelioides v. depressa and Cymopterus basalticus are sensitive to continued spread of cheatgrass and spotted knapweed.
Issue-2 Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources.
Due to the low probably of success in containing and controlling nonnative plants by taking a no action approach, impacts to Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources would be identical to those disclosed above under environmental consequences of Issue 1.
Issue 3 Wildlife Resources
Nonnative plant abundance would likely increase affecting additional areas and expanding on established sites.
Loss of native vegetation would continue.
Wildlife are dependent on native plant and animal communities for cover and forage.
Over time, nonnative plants out compete and replace native plants.
This decreases the diversity, quantity, and quality of forage and the long term habitat carrying capacity is reduced.
As native herbaceous vegetation is lost to nonnative plants ground cover for ground-nesting birds also becomes limited.
This also affects insect populations and the effects can cascade through out the food chain.
Taken together, these effects can result in a complete loss of wildlife from an area.
Implementation of this alternative would be inconsistent with the GMP to manage the park to: maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation; eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources; Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man; and, Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges.
Issue 4 Water Resources
The consequences of implementing alternative 1 would result in the continued spread of invasive exotic plants into the riparian ecosystems.
Invasive, exotic plants are often more competitive than native riparian species and posses less root mass to maintain streambank stability.
As exotic plant abundance increases at the expense of native flora, loss of streambank stability would increase sedimentation, lowering water quality in and out of the park.
Downstream domestic water users would require addition filtration.
Increased sedimentation and lower water quality would impact park fisheries by silting in spawning gravel and lowering the overall fisheries habitat in the park.
Water quality within park streams would be inconsistent with the natural resource management objective identified in the GMP, 1993, to maintain the pristine quality water resources in the park.
Issues 5 Visitors
Under this alternative, nonnative plants would thrive and increase at the most popular visitor facilities and recreation sites.
Seeds and seedhead would be transported throughout the park via roadways and trails and nonnative species would spread.
This would increase the threat to resources on a larger and larger scale over time.
Nonnative plants establishment at remote trailheads would lead to introduction into the parks backcountry.
Use of non-certified weed-seed-free hay would also contribute to nonnative plant infestation into the backcountry.
Over time, biodiversity would be lost and downward trends with vegetative community and wildlife diversity would occur.
Implementation of this alternative would be inconsistent with the GMP to manage the park to: maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation; eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources; Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man; and, Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges.
Issues 6 Health and Safety
If sporadic project funding is received the treating roadways does put employees at risk due to inattentive drivers.
Under this alternative there are no health impacts to employees and the visiting public as sporadic non systematic mechanical treatments, if funded, utilize no toxins.
Mitigation measures for the No Action alternative.
1.
All employees conducting mechanical treatments are required to wear orange reflective safety vest while working along roadways.
2.
Mechanical treatments along roadways will only be conducted during lower visitor use periods, Mondays through Wednesday.
3.
Gloves and long sleeve shirts will be required during treatments to avoid injury to hands and any potential allergic reactions.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects associated with implementation of the no action alternative are that as more and more acreage within watersheds were impacted by nonnative plant infestations the problem would become one of a landscape and ecosystem scale.
Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources
Irreversible commitments of resources include consumption or destruction of nonrenewable resources such as minerals and archeological remains.
There is no irreversible commitment of resources associated with this alternative.
Irretrievable commitments of resources are uses that may cause them to be lost because the lands providing these resources are allocated for other uses.
Under the no action alternative vegetative, wildlife habitat and water quality would all be lost as more and more acreage becomes allocated to nonnative plant production
Precedent Setting
This action does not establish a precedent for future actions, which are similar in nature but that might have significant effects.
4.2 ALTERNATIVE 2 Mechanical Control
Issue 1 Vegetative Resources
Implementation of the Mechanical Control alternative would mitigate some of the negative ecological effects caused by exotic plants as described in section 4.1 above.
Mechanical treatment, including hand pulling, mowing, and cutting of exotic plants is an effective and practical control method only in the smallest, most localized infestations.
Although, in general, fewer negative ecological consequences will occur with the Mechanical Control alternative (alternative 2) than with the No Action alternative (alternative 1), some actions proposed by the Mechanical Control alternative will, in themselves, have negative ecological consequences.
Hand-pulling exotic plants often results in soil surface disturbance.
Because many exotic plants, including spotted knapweed, are early-successional pioneer species, soil disturbances created by plant removal may favor re-establishment of exotic species.
Although mowing can be used to reduce invasive plant vigor and seed production, mowing in mixed stands of exotic and native grasses can shift the competitive balance towards pest plants and promote site dominance by undesirable exotic plants.
Seeds and other propagules can be spread from infested areas to native plant communities by improperly cleaned or otherwise contaminated mechanical equipment and tools.
Mitigation measures for the Mechanical Control alternative.
1) Carefully research plant community ecology and biology to minimize negative effects of control methods (mowing, hand pulling) on native plants.
2)Implement standards for equipment cleaning and sterility to prevent unintentional spread of invasive plant propagules.
While the spread of small populations of invasive plants could be slowed, large-scale exotic plant control by mechanical means is unlikely.
If the mechanical control alternative is adopted, it is likely that ecosystem degradation would be reduced in severity and extent, but would continue to occur as described in section 4.1 above.
Mechanical control could prevent establishment of new invasive plant populations if the infestations were detected promptly.
Issue-2 Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources.
Due to the low probably of success in containing and controlling nonnative plants by taking a no action approach mechanical controls alone, impacts to Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources would be identical to those disclosed above under environmental consequences of Alternative 1, No Action.
Issue 3 Wildlife Resources
Mechanical control would likely slow the spread of nonnative plants and allow persistence of native plants in lightly infested areas.
However, some forms of mechanical control, mowing for example, have been shown to increase abundance of nonnative plants (Benz et al. 1999).
Mowing also changes community structure and may reduce habitat for small mammals and ground nesting birds.
Habitat carrying capacity for wildlife would likely continue to degrade over the long term.
This is because continued ground disturbance would provide avenues for further establishment of nonnative plants.
Implementation of this alternative would be inconsistent with the GMP to manage the park to: maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation; eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources; Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man; and, Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges
Issue 4 Water Resources
Implementation of the Mechanical Control alternative would mitigate some of the effects caused by exotic plants reducing streambank stability and lowering water quality as described in section 4.1 above.
Mechanical treatment, including hand pulling, mowing, and cutting of exotic plants is an effective and practical control method only in the smallest, most localized infestations.
While the spread of small populations of invasive plants into riparian zones could be slowed, large-scale exotic plant control by mechanical means is unlikely.
If the mechanical control alternative is adopted, it is likely that water quality degradation would continue overtime but at a slower rate then that described in section 4.1 above.
Water quality within park streams would be still be inconsistent with the natural resource management objective identified in the GMP to maintain the pristine quality water resources in the park.
Issues 5 Visitors
Under this alternative, intensive efforts to control nonnative plants would be conducted at the most popular visitor facilities and recreation sites.
This would stem but not prevent the visitor spread of seeds and seeded through transport by vehicle along park roadways.
Not all nonnatives could be treated with this method.
Some transport would still occur with the potential to slowly spread nonnative plants throughout the park but at a lesser rate than under alternative 4.1.
Nonnative plants establishment at remote trailheads would still lead to introduction into the parks backcountry.
Use of certified weed-seed-free hay would contribute to preventing nonnative plant infestation into the backcountry.
Overtime, biodiversity would be lost and downward trends with vegetative community and wildlife diversity would occur but at a lesser rate than described under alternative 4.1.
Implementation of this alternative would be inconsistent with the GMP to manage the park to: maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation; eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources; Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man; and, Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges.
Issues 6 Health and Safety
The treating of roadways does put employees at risk due to inattentive drivers.
Under this alternative there are no health impacts to employees and the visiting public as mechanical treatments alone utilize no toxins.
Mitigation measures for the mechanical treatment alternative.
1.
All employees conducting mechanical treatments are required to wear orange reflective safety vest while working along roadways.
2.
Mechanical treatments along roadways will only be conducted during lower visitor use periods, Mondays through Wednesday.
3.
Gloves and long sleeve shirts will be required during treatments to avoid injury to hands and any potential allergic reactions.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects associated with implementation of the no action alternative are that as more and more acreage within watersheds were impacted by nonnative plant infestations the problem would become one of a landscape and ecosystem scale.
Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources
Irreversible commitments of resources include consumption or destruction of nonrenewable resources such as minerals and archeological remains.
There are no irreversible commitments of resources associated with this alternative.
Irretrievable commitments of resources are uses that may cause them to be lost because the lands providing these resources are allocated for other uses.
Under the alternative 1 vegetative, wildlife habitat and water quality would all be lost as more and more acreage becomes allocated to nonnative plant production
Precedent Setting
This action does not establish a precedent for future actions, which are similar in nature but that might have significant effects.
4.3 ALTERNATIVE.
3 Combination of Mechanical/Chemical Controls
Issue 1 Vegetative Resources
Implementation of the Mechanical/Chemical Control alternative would lead to significant improvements, compared to Alternatives 1 and 2, in plant community diversity, wildlife habitat, sensitive plant population status, and ecosystem function in Great Basin National Park.
Addition of chemical control methods allows efficient spot treatment of exotic plants over larger areas and with less soil disturbance than mechanical methods alone.
Incorrect storage or handling can cause chemical spills that potentially harm native plants, animals (including humans), and can contaminate soil, air, and water.
These potential consequences can be minimized or eliminated by following proper chemical handling procedure as prescribed by federal and state law.
Mitigation measures for the Mechanical/Chemical Control alternative:
1) Apply mitigation measures for all mechanical control activities described in section 4.2 above.
2) Chemical control materials should be handled, stored, mixed, applied, and disposed of properly in accordance with Federal law.
All projects involving herbicides should be supervised or performed by Nevada-licensed pesticide applicators.
While the spread of small populations of invasive plants could be slowed, large-scale exotic plant control by mechanical means is unlikely.
If the mechanical control alternative is adopted, it is likely that ecosystem degradation caused by would be reduced in severity and extent, but would continue to occur as described in section 4.1 above.
Mechanical control could prevent establishment of new invasive plant populations if the infestations were detected promptly
Issue-2 Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources.
Adoption of this alternative could mitigate most of the negative ecological effects described under the No Action alternative (section 4.1 above).
Implementation of the Mechanical/Chemical Control alternative would provide efficient, widespread, and long-term control of invasive exotic plants.
This alternative can prevent the establishment and spread of pest plants into TE
Overspray can kill non-target plants, including listed rare and sensitive species.
Mitigation Measures:
1) Do not use herbicides near populations of sensitive native plants.
Inventory all sites for sensitive plant species prior to chemical controls.
Issue 3 Wildlife Resources
Control of nonnative plants would consist of physical and mechanical means to reduce populations and chemical applications to further reduce nonnative plant abundance.
As stated under Alternative 2, Alternative 3 would likely slow the spread of nonnative plants and allow persistence of native plants in infested areas.
Areas treated with chemical controls have shown marked increases in native vegetation (Rice et al. 1997, Benz et al. 1999).
Thus, habitat carrying capacity would be maintained or increased..
Spot application of chemicals would prevent widespread contamination of other non-target organisms preventing chemical transfer through the food chain.
Implementation of this alternative would be consistent with the GMP to manage the park to: maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation; eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources; Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man; and, Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges.
Issue 4 Water Resources
Implementation of this alternative would mitigate most of the effects caused by exotic plants as described in section 4.1 above.
A combination of mechanical and chemical methods has a good chance of controlling and eliminating nonnative plant populations.
Some hazards are inherent with chemicals.
Drift of chemical herbicides into live water sources could lower water quality.
Spilling or applying herbicides to aquatic areas can potentially disrupt aquatic ecosystems and contaminate public water supplies
Mitigation measures for the Mechanical/Chemical Control alternative:
1) Chemical control materials should be handled, stored, mixed, applied, and disposed of properly in accordance with Federal law.
All projects involving herbicides should be supervised or performed by Nevada-licensed pesticide applicators.
2) Use herbicides that have been label by the EPA to be safe for use near aquatic systems.
Application of herbicides would not occur within 10 yards of live water sources.
Control of nonnative plants by mechanical means combined with individual spot chemical applications to further reduce nonnative plant abundance would allow potential containment and eventual eradication of those species of utmost concern from riparian ecosystems.
Loss of streambank stability would be greatly reduced and native riparian vegetation would to allow re-establishing and competing in nonnative plant infested areas.
As stated under Alternative 2, Alternative 3 would likely slow the spread of nonnative plants and but would still allow persistence of nonnative plants in riparian areas.
Areas treated with chemical controls have shown marked increases in native vegetation (Rice et al. 1997, Benz et al. 1999).
Water quality within park streams would be consistent with the natural resource management objective identified in the General Management Plan, 1993, to maintain the pristine quality water resources in the park.
Issue 5 Visitors
Under this alternative, intensive efforts to control nonnative plants would be conducted at the most popular visitor facilities and recreation sites.
The combination of mechanical and chemical control would allow for containment and eradication from these sites.
Monitoring on an annual bases would be required to prevent re-infestation.
This would greatly reduce visitor spread of seeds and seedhead through transport by vehicle along park roadways.
Not all nonnatives could be treated with this method.
Some transport would still occur with the potential to slowly spread nonnative plants throughout the park but at a lesser rate than under alternative 4.2.
Nonnative plants establishment at remote trailheads would be contained reducing introduction into the parks backcountry at a greater rate than under alternative 4.2. Use of certified weed-seed-free hay would contribute to preventing nonnative plant infestation into the backcountry.
Implementation of this alternative would be consistent with the GMP direction to manage the park to: maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation; Eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources; Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man; and, Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges.
Issues 6 Health and Safety
The treating of roadways does put employees at risk due to inattentive drivers.
Under this alternative there are no health impacts to employees and the visiting public associated with mechanical treatments.
The use of herbicides does pose potential health impacts to employees performing treatments and the visiting public if they enter into sites within a few hours after treatments.
Mitigation measures for the Mechanical/Chemical Control alternative.
1.
All employees conducting mechanical treatments are required to wear orange reflective safety vest while working along roadways.
2.
Mechanical treatments along roadways will only be conducted during lower visitor use periods, Mondays through Wednesday.
3.
Gloves and long sleeve shirts will be required during treatments to avoid injury to hands and any potential allergic reactions.
4.
Chemical treatments along within developed sites will only be conducted during lower visitor use periods, Mondays through Wednesday.
The sites will be posted for three days after treatment to inform the public of the need for treatment, the herbicide used and any precautions.

Only EPA approved herbicides will be applied by licensed and trained applicators and all application rates and techniques will be followed according to labeled directions.
6.
Only basal spot treatments of individual plants will be allowed.
No broadcast spraying will be conducted.
7.
All safety equipment to prevent exposure to applicators will be required.

8) At all times a pesticide decontamination kit will be on-site and readily available.
Cumulative Effects
No cumulative effects are associated with implementation of this alternative, as nonnative plant population would be reduced, contained and eventually eradicated.
Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources
There are no irreversible commitments of resources associated with this alternative.
There are no irretrievable commitments of resources associated with this alternative.
Precedent Setting
This action does not establish a precedent for future actions, which are similar in nature but that might have significant effects.
4.4 ALTERNATIVE 4 Combination of Mechanical/Chemical/Biological Controls
Issue 1 Vegetative Resources
Adoption of this alternative could mitigate most, if not all, of the negative ecological effects described under the No Action alternative (section 4.1 above).
Implementation of the Mechanical/Chemical/ Biological Control alternative would provide the most efficient, widespread, and long-term control of invasive exotic plants.
This alternative can prevent the establishment and spread of pest plants and allow plant communities, and the concomitant ecosystem components, structures, and functions, to return to a state more within the historic, natural range of variability for Great Basin National Park.
Addition of biological control methods to the tools used in controlling exotic plants allows for longer-term and larger-scale rehabilitation of plant communities than would be available with mechanical and chemical methods alone.
Mitigation measures for the Mechanical/Chemical/Biological Control alternative:
1.
Apply mitigation measures for all mechanical and chemical control activities described in section 4.2 and 4.3 above.
Issue-2 Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive plant resources.
Adoption of this alternative could mitigate most of the negative ecological effects described under the No Action alternative (section 4.1 above).
Implementation of the Mechanical/Chemical l/Biological Control alternative would provide the most efficient, widespread, and long-term control of invasive exotic plants.
This alternative can prevent the establishment and spread of pest plants into TE
Implementation of the Mechanical/Chemical l/Biological Control alternative could potentially cause environmental damages associated with the misuse of the chemical control material.
Overspray can kill non-target plants, including listed rare and sensitive species.
Mitigation Measures:
1) Do not use herbicides near populations of sensitive native plants.
Inventory all sites for sensitive plant species prior to chemical controls.
Issue 3 Wildlife Resources
Control of nonnative plants would consist of physical and mechanical means to reduce populations and chemical applications to further reduce nonnative plant abundance.
Biological control agents (i.e., insects) would be introduced to control continued spread.
Alternative 4 would likely slow the spread of nonnative plants and minimize persistence of native plants in infested areas as biological control agents would work on plants missed from other treatments.
Biological agents would provide greater long-term control by suppressing further nonnative plant population development and working on plants missed from other treatments and persistence.
Thus, habitat carrying capacity would be maintained or increased over longer periods.
Spot application of chemicals would prevent widespread contamination of other non-target organisms preventing chemical transfer through the food chain.
Implementation of this alternative may have negative environmental consequences in addition to those of using mechanical and chemical exotic plant control measures (sections 4.2 and 4.3 above).
Although the probability is small, the introduction of non-native biological controls into ecosystems could cause negative effects on native plant and animal communities.
For example, spotted knapweed biological controls could theoretically prey upon native species or displace ecologically similar native insects.
These concerns, however, are mostly unfounded as biological controls are extensively and thoroughly researched and tested.
Mitigation measures for the Mechanical/Chemical/Biological Control alternative:
1) Use only thoroughly researched, tested, and approved biological controls.
2) Monitor populations of biological controls, target plants, and native plants to ensure host specificity
Implementation of this alternative would be consistent with the GMP to manage the park to: maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation; eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources; Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man; and, Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges.
Issue 4 Water Resources
Implementation of this alternative would mitigate most of the effects caused by exotic plants as described in section 4.1 above.
A combination of mechanical, chemical and biological methods has a good chance of controlling and eliminating nonnative plant populations.
Some hazards are inherent with chemicals.
Drift of chemical herbicides into live water sources could lower water quality.
Spilling or applying herbicides to aquatic areas can potentially disrupt aquatic ecosystems and contaminate public water supplies
Mitigation measures for the Mechanical/Chemical/Biological Control alternative:
1) Apply mitigation measures for all mechanical and chemical control activities described in section 4.2 and 4.3 above.
Control of nonnative plants by mechanical means combined with individual spot chemical applications to further reduce nonnative plant abundance would allow potential containment and eventual eradication of those species of utmost concern from riparian ecosystems.
Biological agents would provide greater long-term control by suppressing further nonnative plant population development and working on plants missed from other treatments and persistence.
Loss of streambank stability would be greatly reduced and native riparian vegetation would to allow re-establishing and competing in nonnative plant infested areas.
As stated under Alternative 2, Alternative 4 would likely slow the spread of nonnative plants and but would still allow persistence of nonnative plants in riparian areas.
Areas treated with chemical controls have shown marked increases in native vegetation (Rice et al. 1997, Benz et al. 1999).
Water quality within park streams would be consistent with the natural resource management objective identified in the General Management Plan, 1993, to maintain the pristine quality water resources in the park.
Issue 5 Visitors
Under this alternative, intensive efforts to control nonnative plants would be conducted at the most popular visitor facilities and recreation sites.
The combination of mechanical, chemical and biological control would allow for containment and eradication from these sites.
Biological agents would provide greater long-term control by suppressing further nonnative plant population development and working on plants missed from other treatments and persistence.
Monitoring on an annual bases would be required to prevent re-infestation of these sites.
This would greatly reduce visitor spread of seeds and seedhead through transport by vehicle along park roadways.
Not all nonnatives could be treated with this method.
Some transport would still occur with the potential to slowly spread nonnative plants throughout the park but at a lesser rate than under alternative 4.2.
Nonnative plants establishment at remote trailheads would be contained reducing introduction into the parks backcountry at a greater rate than under alternative 4.2. Use of certified weed-seed-free hay would contribute to preventing nonnative plant infestation into the backcountry.
Implementation of this alternative would be consistent with the GMP to manage the park to: maintain the greatest degree of biological diversity and ecosystem integrity within the provisions of the authorizing legislation; eliminate or mitigate any impacts that threaten biological resources; Monitor and evaluate biological diversity in relation to the influences of major climatic and environmental change, particularly those caused by man; and, Protect threatened, endangered, and endemic species and restore them within their natural ranges.
Issues 6 Health and Safety
The treating of roadways does put employees at risk due to inattentive drivers.
Under this alternative there are no health impacts to employees and the visiting public associated with mechanical and biological treatments.
The use of herbicides does pose potential health impacts to employees performing treatments and the visiting public if they enter into sites within a few hours after treatments.
Mitigation measures for the Mechanical/Chemical/Biological Control alternative.
1) All employees conducting mechanical treatments are required to wear orange reflective safety vest while working along roadways.
2) Mechanical treatments along roadways will only be conducted during lower visitor use periods, Mondays through Wednesday.
3) Gloves and long sleeve shirts will be required during treatments to avoid injury to hands and any potential allergic reactions.
4) Chemical treatments along within developed sites will only be conducted during lower visitor use periods, Mondays through Wednesday.
The sites will be posted for three days after treatment to inform the public of the need for treatment, the herbicide used and any precautions.
5) Only EPA approved herbicides will be applied by licensed and trained applicators and all application rates and techniques will be followed according to labeled directions.
6) Only basal spot treatments of individual plants will be allowed.
No broadcast spraying will be conducted.
7.
All safety equipment to prevent exposure to applicators will be required.
This will include:
a.
Kleenguard or similar brand of disposable coveralls. b. OSHA/NIOSH/MSHA approved respirators. c. Protective chemical splash goggles d. 22mil Nitrile safety gloves e. 16inch rubber safety boots.
8) At all times a pesticide decontamination kit will be on-site and readily available.
