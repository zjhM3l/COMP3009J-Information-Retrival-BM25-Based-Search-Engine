These advertisements contain the following statements:
A. "Bulk E-Mail I[nternet] S[ervice]

The bottom line is that LS Enterprises is offering the full 'Cyber-Bomber' package for only $1,495.
This will be the best investment you will make this year - guaranteed.

Plus 12 Bonuses . . .
All For Only $295!
EARN INSANE PROFITS WITH THE RIGHT FORMULA
. . . .
You can literally make a fortune by just sending out email and the best part is that you will pay nothing to do so.
All you need is an internet connection that you can find for as little as $19 per month.
. . .
LS Enterprises has been in the online marketing business for over 7 years.
We have helped many individuals succeed in marketing their product effectively.
It's very simple to do.
In fact, soon you will have the problem of what to do with all the cash you will make from sending out bulk email.
Here is just one of many true success stories we have seen . . .
We did a mailing of 1 1/2 million emails for one of our customers.
He was selling a home workers manual for $29.95.
His results are very typical and scary.
He took in over 700 orders! 700 x $29.95 = $20,000.
This gentleman was so amazed, that after being skeptical, it had really happened to him, he made it, he found a niche.
That niche was email! He went on to buy our full list and will be set for life in less than a years time.
All this from selling a manual via email.
That was just one of the many success stories we hear everyday.
It may all sound to [sic] good to be true.
Well, we can tell you this.
It really does work.
Why else are there so many individuals doing it? They are not just wasting their time.
They are all making mega bucks."

All recipients are located in the United States and are interested in receiving emails from other businesses.
Recent research reveals that approximately 90% of our recipients are small business owners or opportunity seekers.
The remaining 10% of our list is comprised of medium to large corporations.
. . .
These types of individuals have proven to be most receptive to internet marketing."

D.
"The Truths about Bulk Email

Our Recipient List
Our recipient list is over 27,000,000 and continuously growing.
It is made up of mainly small business owners and individuals that would be categorized as opportunity seekers.
Experience has shown that these types of recipients are the most responsive to this form of marketing."

Through the means described in Paragraph 6, respondents have represented, expressly or by implication, that:
A. Respondents act as an E-Mail Internet Service Provider, maintaining their own proprietary high speed E-Mail relay network through which unsolicited commercial E-mail can be transmitted.
B. Respondents sent out 1.5 million unsolicited commercial E-Mails on behalf of one customer who was selling a home worker's manual for $29.95 each, and this customer took in over 700 orders as a result of this one mailing, earning $20,000.
8.
In truth and in fact:
A. Respondents do not act as an E-Mail Internet Service Provider, and do not maintain their own proprietary high speed E-Mail relay network through which unsolicited commercial E-mail can be transmitted.
Rather, respondents can arrange for purchasers to have their unsolicited commercial E-mail transmitted through actual Internet Service Providers.
B. Respondents did not send out 1.5 million unsolicited commercial E-Mails on behalf of one customer who was selling a home worker's manual for $29.95 each, and who then took in over 700 orders as a result of this one mailing, earning $20,000.
The representation set forth in Paragraph 7(B) does not reflect the actual experience of any customer of respondents.
Therefore, the representations set forth in Paragraph 7 were, and are, false or misleading.
9.
Through the means described in Paragraph 6, respondents have represented, expressly or by implication, that:
A. Purchasers of respondents' unsolicited commercial E-Mail products and services can reasonably expect to achieve a specific level of earnings, income, or sales, such as: sales of 700 products and profits of $20,000 for each one-time sending of bulk unsolicited commercial E-Mail; earnings of millions of dollars per year; or recouping an investment of up to $8,000 within a matter of days.
B. Most or all of the recipients on respondents' E-Mail recipient lists have been identified as small business owners and individuals categorized as opportunity seekers who are interested in receiving unsolicited commercial E-Mail.
10.
In truth and in fact:
A. Few if any purchasers attain the specific level of earnings, income, or sales represented by respondents.
B. Few if any of the recipients on respondents' E-Mail recipient lists have been identified as small business owners and individuals categorized as opportunity seekers who are interested in receiving unsolicited commercial E-Mail.
Therefore, the representations set forth in Paragraph 9 were, and are, false or misleading.
11.
Through the means described in Paragraph 6, respondents have represented, expressly or by implication, that they possessed and relied upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the representations set forth in Paragraph 9, at the time the representations were made.

B. Respondents have actual job openings for "mystery shoppers" all over the country, and consumers who respond to respondents' "mystery shopper" promotion will be given as many "mystery shopper" assignments from respondents as they want or need.
15.
In truth and in fact:
A. Respondents do not act as contractors for major corporations to hire consumers to work as "mystery shoppers," and have not hired thousands of consumers to work as "mystery shoppers."
Rather, respondents do nothing more than sell a manual known as the "Guide to Professional Mystery Shopping."

B. Consumers who respond to respondents' "mystery shopper" promotion will always receive for free all merchandise purchased during "mystery shopper" assignments.
17.
In truth and in fact:
A. Few if any consumers who respond to respondents' "mystery shopper" promotion attain the specific level of earnings represented by respondents.
B. Consumers who respond to respondents' "mystery shopper" promotion may not always receive for free all merchandise purchased during "mystery shopper" assignments.
Whether consumers receive any free merchandise, and the types of merchandise they may receive, depend on the policies of companies who actually hire and use "mystery shoppers."
Therefore, the representations set forth in Paragraph 16 were, and are, false or misleading.

Through the means described in Paragraph 20, respondents have represented, expressly or by implication, that respondents have helped thousands of consumers to find home-based work.
22.
In truth and in fact, respondents have not helped thousands of consumers to find home-based work.
Respondents sell a home workers' manual that contains tips for finding home-based work and a list of companies that may be hiring home workers.
Respondents have sold fewer than 200 of these manuals.

Sale of Distribution Rights to Consumer Manuals
27.
Respondents have disseminated or have caused to be disseminated advertisements for a business opportunity or work-at-home opportunity involving making money through the reproduction and distribution of various consumer manuals, including but not necessarily limited to the attached Exhibit G that was disseminated via unsolicited commercial E-Mail and postings on Internet newsgroups.

. . . .
FOR SALE!
My Multi-Million Dollar Publishing Company - $199.
If you ever wanted 'the easy way out' to make a lot of money with a business of your own.
. .
Here is the easiest way to start!
. . . .
For the past five years or so. . .
I've been running small, inexpensive ads in the back of many large National magazines and the Internet.
These ads were always small and very cheap.
. .
On [sic] these ads I've been selling little manuals.
These manuals sold from $14.95 - $49.95 each.
I always ran a different ad for each manual I was selling.
I have collected the reprint rights to 15 different HOT SELLING manuals on topics that consumers really need.
. . .
[I]t is very cheap to produce HOW-TO manuals.
It usually costs me about 40 cents to produce each manual that I get to sell for as much as $49.95.
That s [sic] one hell of a mark-up.
Anyway, I've been selling these 15 manuals with little, cheap ads in the back of National Magazines and on the Internet for the past five years or so. . .
Each manual brings me about $2000 - $4000 per week - PER AD. . . .
This is big money stuff.
. .
A very lucrative business to be in.
Well this is where the unbelievable offer comes in. . .
I hope your [sic] sitting down for this one. . . because it is a once in a lifetime offer to you.
I do not know of any easier way for you to become financially independent.
. .
In fact THEIR [sic] IS NO EASIER WAY!!! . . .
Since I m [sic] so busy selling my best-selling HOW-TO business books nowadays.
. .
I do not have the time to service these ads. . .
It s [sic] just that I really can t [sic]
. . . .
[L]ike I was saying $2000 to $4000 per week per advertisement.
There are 15 different manuals.
. . and there are several hundreds of magazines to run these little ads in.
. . . .
I m [sic] willing to sell you the entire set of reprint rights to all 15 of these manuals on a 3 1\2 [sic]
I m [sic] also willing to give you the rough drafts of the actual ads that sold these manuals!!! (all you have to do is have them copied.
You can do it yourself - or you can take them all to a local copy shop.
. . this is why I say Push One Button And Start Your Own Million Dollar Publishing Company).
. . . .
Remember these are PROVEN winners.
. . . .
One of the manuals in this kit sold $4,000,000 worth by a Florida man named M. Zboch.
Now, I got the reprint rights.
. . and I ll [sic] sell them to you. . .
If your [sic] wondering how much this will cost you. . .
Think about it for a minute.
There are 15 different manuals that can make you $3000 per week - each manual.
. .
That equals $45,000 per week if you placed an ad in one magazine.
. .
Now there are thousands of magazines and newspapers out there.
. .
You can place these ads in more magazines as you make more money.
. .
You can also sell them through direct mail.
. .
. . . .
[Y]ou get to make a ton of money off these manuals, for as long as you wish.
. . .
All I ask for is this.
. .
$199.00 and I'll include RUSH shipping for free! . . .
But there is only one drawback.
. .
I will only allow 200 sets of my Publishing Company In A Box to be sold.
It won t [sic] make much sense if I sold the kit to 1000 or 2000 people.
. . the market would be saturated with the same manuals.
. . and I don't want that.
To make sure the same people who invest in this offer get the same results I got in the past 5 years.
. .
Only 200 people can have it for $199.00.
. . . .
And anyone who gets their check in to me late.
. .
I ll [sic] simply send it back un-cashed.
. . .
For only $199.00 I m [sic] going to let you in on the easiest money you ll [sic]
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING!! The ads are done.
The manuals are all written.
The printer will print the manuals for about 40 cents.
. .
All you have to do is place the ads and your [sic] set.
. .
Push one button today! Rush me your payment of $199.00 right now. . . and get your very own MILLION-DOLLAR publishing company going!
