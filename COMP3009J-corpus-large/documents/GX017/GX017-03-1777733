We are looking forward to a great broadcast and web chat.
The weather is looking good and we should have calm seas at Conch Reef.
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 2 - 13:22:04 ] Hello everyone! Should be an exciting live broadcast tomorrow as we discuss the Sustainable Seas Expeditions (SSE) and focus on coral reef health and diseases.
Your questions will be answered by Laura Francis, SSE Education Coordinator, Mary Tagliareni, Education Coordinator for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and two coral reef experts, Laurie Maclaughlin and John Halas.
We look forward to hearing from all of you and will do our best to make sure that all of your insightful questions get answered.
[ LauraFrancis/SSEeducation - 4 - 13:44:18 ] Welcome Everyone.
In addition to John Halas and Lauri Maclaughlin, we are also very fortunate to have Joanne Delaney, Research Interpretor from the Key Largo Sanctuary office, join us on the chat!
[ Mary/FKNMSEd - 6 - 05:54:55 ] I would like to extend a special welcome to a few groups joining us today.
Mrs. O'Harra's class from Anchorage, Alaska; Mrs. Meraz's class in Texas; the Special Projects Team in Silver Spring, Maryland; and Mr. Diersing's 4-H club in Key Largo, Florida.
[ John/fknmsresourcemanager - 7 - 08:41:39 ] Hi, My name is John Halas and I am a Resource Manager for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary working on resource management issues out of the upper region office in Key Largo
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 8 - 08:41:42 ] Hello, I'm Lauri MacLaughlin, a resource manager with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
My work involves field surveys of seagrass and coral communities that are injured due to vessel groundings, anchor damage, and of habitats that might be impacted by aquaculture, artificial reefs or scientific permitted projects.
We also work to restore injured seagrass beds and coral colonies.
[ John/fknmsresourcemanager - 9 - 08:44:46 ] RE: [Androsko/BishopVerotHS]
We look forward to your chat! Welcome to you and your students! We are looking forward to an interesting chat session.
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 10 - 08:46:14 ] RE: [Androsko/BishopVerotHS]
We look forward to your chat! Welcome to the Sustainable Seas Chat room.
I will be here to answer questions that you may have relating to resource protection and management of coral reefs, seagrass beds and Florida's coral reef ecosystem.
[ Benz/SussexTechHS - 12 - 09:09:23 ] Unfortunately we will not be having class...
But I will be streaming the webcast in my Environmental LDP Period Looking forward to participating!!
[ unknown - 14 - 09:10:17 ] RE: [MastAcademy]
[ Bryant/FLKeys4HCoordinator - 15 - 09:34:05 ] Hello, Thanks for the warm welcome.
We should have some Monroe County 4H members participating sometime today.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 19 - 10:08:41 ] Hello everyone.
My name is Joanne Delaney, I work for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary as a research interpreter.
I hope to be able to assist with the chat today by answering your questions and explaining some of the exciting research that is happening in the Sanctuary related to corals and coral diseases.
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 22 - 10:31:21 ] RE: [MarkTohulka]
We are looking forward to the event.
If you would like, please feel free to post a few questions in advance of the live broadcast.
[ Nick - 23 - 10:49:21 ] Mary and staff, Good Luck with the tranmission.
As soon as my Parent/Teacher conference is over, I will be watching the video and chat.
[ JBrady/DC - 27 - 11:04:34 ] We participated in your broadcast last year, looking forward to seeing how the research is progressing.
(Hi Laura and Trish)
[ SSE/Expert - 34 - 11:08:06 ] RE: [Joanna/CCHS]
It appears this hurricane season has not been as bad as originally predicted! The Gunter's rudder should be fixed within the next month.
[ mike/bishopverot - 36 - 11:09:22 ] What were your experiences with the numerous cold water seeps located in the gulf of Mexico, especially near the coast of Naples, Fl.
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 42 - 11:11:20 ] RE: [JBrady/DC]
Are you having technical problems, or is it something with my computer? We are currently working with members from the NASA team to get the live Web cast up and running on RealPlayer.
Apparently there has been a flaw in the system that is being worked out as we write.
Please stand by.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 48 - 11:12:22 ] RE: [KellyandCatherine/BishopVerotHS]
Many researchers that come to the Sanctuary fund their own research through grants or university funding.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 49 - 11:13:24 ] RE: [Micah]
The main thing all snorklers can do is make sure you keep you body floating above the reef at all times.
Many reefs are so shallow that you may harm both yourself and the coral if you don't do so .
Thank You U. John

We are at the Montessori Island Charter School in Tavernier and our grade 2-3 class is very excited.
Good luck.
Welcome to Ms. Bridget's class from the Montessori Island Charter School!
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 53 - 11:16:34 ] RE: [Dane/GilksterTeamTunaBVHS]
Depending on where you are in Florida, the water temperatures are 84 degrees or so at present.
It is refreshing and comfortable right now, but it will get cold this winter (70's) and we'll be whereing wetsuits then.
Still this is really warm compared to most locations in the United States.
We're tropical...
[ davidbvhs - 54 - 11:16:36 ] What is the name of the oceanic plate in the Gulf of Mexico?
[ Dane/GilksterTeamTunaBVHS - 56 - 11:16:36 ] We have been following your research the past couple of weeks.
You guys are doing amazing work.
How has the Deep Worker 2000 contributed to your study of the continental shelf?
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 57 - 11:16:57 ] RE: [Ryan/AlysonTeamTunaBVHS]
They eat detritus and other items, keeping the sea floor clean.
Lobstering has some impacts because the lobster traps can damage coral reef areas and lobster trap line may entangle certain other organisms.
[ LauraFrancis/SSEeducation - 58 - 11:17:15 ] The broadcast has started.

[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 68 - 11:24:23 ] RE: [Bethany]
Have you seen any? Hi Bethany, Glad to hear you are learning such things in your home school.
Yes that is very true.
Since we don't get to see things down deep very often, compared to shallow water, they can appear very strange.
The low light levels found at those depths are a major factor in adaptation and animal form.
While participating on the SSE in the Tortugas we got to see on video footage that Sylvia Earle shot on a 1600 ft dive.
See you later.
Say Hi to Mom and Grandma.
Thanks, U. John
[ chelseabvhs - 71 - 11:24:23 ] just wondering what effect the sponging industry has had on coral reef survival.
[ Dane/GilksterTeamTunaBVHS - 72 - 11:24:23 ] I am currently trying to graph your progress on a chart, could you give me your current coordinates?
[ Tina - 74 - 11:24:24 ] Hi Mary! What would you say was the most important thing that you learned from this mission? We are anxiously awaiting your return home :)
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 75 - 11:24:29 ] RE: [Kimberly/CCHS]
Here in the Florida Keys, a scientist by the name of Dr. Drew Harvell has identified a fungus responsible for a disease affecting sea fans.
She is at Cornell University, and I'm not sure I will spell this right but the disease is call "Aspergillosus."
You might check the coral disease website by Esther Peters and McCarthy.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 76 - 11:26:08 ] RE: [JuliaandAshley/BVHS]
Not all causes of diseases have been identified.
Many corals are also affected by coral bleaching, which is not exactly a disease but a stress response that appears to be due to high temperature water, among other things.
[ Dane/Gilkster/TeamTuna/BVHS - 81 - 11:28:56 ] What was it like doing research off the Southwest Florida coast?
[ ryan/alyson/teamtunabvhs - 82 - 11:28:56 ] What are the differences between the ocean floors of the Gulf off Naples and where you are now off the keys?
[ Dane/Gilkster/TeamTuna/BVHS - 83 - 11:28:56 ] Do you ever have to leave the submarine and venture into the unkown merky waters? Are there any dangers abroad?
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 84 - 11:28:56 ] RE: [JuliaandAshley/BVHS]
The SSE cruise planning team is working on next year's expeditions with the DeepWorker 2000 submersible, keep posted on the SSE Web site for more information on next year's mission.

[ Kimberly/CCHS - 87 - 11:31:06 ] is there a relationship between changes in temperature and the increase of coral diseases?
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 88 - 11:31:25 ] RE: [chelseabvhs]
Sponges play a role in providing habitat for many small organisms.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 92 - 11:33:56 ]
I'm not sure exactly, but I've seen ones as large as several feet across ("wing span")!
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 93 - 11:34:20 ] RE: [Dane/Gilkster/TeamTuna/BVHS]
The Sustainable Seas Expeditions has come to a close for the second field season.
We look forward to the Expeditions next year and may be back in the Florida Keys area.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 94 - 11:35:20 ] RE: [Matt/Jenn/BVHS]
There are also some other beautiful invertebrates, such as nudibranchs, which look like delicate and flowery worms.
[ chelseabvhs - 100 - 11:35:44 ] is it possible to seed the water with zooanthellae in order to stimulate the growth of the coral?
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 101 - 11:35:55 ] RE: [Matt/Jenn/BVHS]
Sylvia Earle saw them at 1600 feet and interestingly I have seen them as shallow as 30 ft. on a dark night in the Philippines.
A very wide range for a single fish.

[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 104 - 11:38:13 ] RE: [Kimberly/CCHS]
do you recommend that we do this? what is the chance that we will introduce some fungus/disease when the pieces are restored? Coral transplantation is a pretty tricky matter given the fragility of some branching corals.
If you live somewhere where corals have broken, perhaps you could contact a local reef expert to see if they have experience in transplanting methods.
[ Matt/Jenn/BVHS - 107 - 11:38:17 ] Thanks for your time!!!
[ Mekka/CCHS - 108 - 11:38:17 ] how did the fish counts go? is there a difference in the numbers/species from the counts done durnig last year's count?
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 109 - 11:39:27 ] RE: [Williams/GeyerBVHS]
Individual coral colonies, say 8-10 feet in diameter can be hundreds of years old, say 500-700 years.
Different species of corals grow at different rates, for instance star corals may grow 1 cm per year whereas branching corals such as elkhorn or staghorn may grow 5-10 cm per year.
Your averge basketball sized boulder coral may be perhaps 50 years old.
Hope this answers many of your questions.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 110 - 11:40:26 ] RE: [Julia/SEAHORSESbvhs]
I heard about artificial reefs being created with plastic cubes.
Is this project pending? What is the success rate of such reefs? Is this occurring any where else? There are many artificial reef projects in the Florida Keys, Florida east coast, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
The placement of artificial reefs is controversial to some, as it is not quite clear what benefits they provide.
Ultimately, our priorities should lie in protecting and preserving natural reefs!
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 111 - 11:41:57 ] RE: [Julia/SEAHORSESbvhs]
If we are unable to get to your questions during the live broadcast, we apologize and look for responses to all of your great questions later.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 112 - 11:42:39 ] RE: [MsBridgetsclass]
Look for a diversity of organisms and coral that has nice, uniform polyps.
Lots of algae may indicate signs of imbalance, but may also be a temporary phenomenon caused by nutrient-rich upwelling events.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 116 - 11:43:55 ] RE: [Williams/GeyerBVHS]
The living large coral heads that can be found today can be 300 to 400 years old and attaining a height of 2 to 3 meters growing at a rate of approx.
1 cm. per yr.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 117 - 11:44:26 ] RE: [TEAMTALLYWAKERBVHS]
Some frequenty seen corals are sea fans, star corals, brain corals, and branching corals such as elkhorn and staghorn coral.

Just Mother Nature's way of saying "don't touch!"
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 126 - 11:47:34 ] RE: [Mellie]
However, would like to ask a question.
Two summers ago Jewfish were spotted off the bow of the Duane and in deep water (90 ft.) off the bow of the Benwood.
This past summer, in checking both locations the fish were not there.
Have you seen any evidence of Jewfish this summer? Thanks.
Yes, Although you did not see them again at those locations they seem to be on the rise and efforts to better understand them are underway through a strong tagging effort in the Keys
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 127 - 11:47:38 ] RE: [Julia/SEAHORSESbvhs]
Thanks.
Be sure to contact Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in Massachusetts when you are in the New England area.
Stellwagen Bank is an offshore underwater feature that supports a rich diversity of marine life, including many whale species.
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 129 - 11:48:47 ] RE: [Mekka/CCHS]
Off course holidays would be our busiest time with over 100 boats a day visiting the site.
Now with the new Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, we don't have this luxury.
Some visitor use studies have been done by aerial photography.
The one tool that we can use to limit visitor use is the mooring buoy program.
Although we don't do this at present, we may someday want to limit one boat to a buoy with no anchoring, even in the sand.
This would be one way to establish a carrying capacity for a particular reef, such as Looe.
We don't have any plans to do so at this time.
[ KimberlyMeraz - 133 - 11:51:52 ] My students ask: Can coral grow in controlled environments so that we may restore lost reefs?
[ Mellie - 134 - 11:51:52 ] John, Thanks so much for responding to Jewfish question.
I'm so glad to know they've been seen and appear to perhaps be on the rise.
So good to learn there is a tagging effort in place in the Keys.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 135 - 11:53:50 ] RE: [KellyandCatherine/BishopVerotHS]
Every time I went to the beach, I found myself looking in the tide pools and searching underwater for neat critters.
What I didn't know was what my career would eventually wind up being! My advice to anyone interested in coral reefs and marine biology is to study hard and take advantage of neat opportunities such as volunteer programs, internships, and shadowing to get some practical experience in marine careers.
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 136 - 11:53:59 ] RE: [Mekka/CCHS]
Dr. Deborah Santavy of the EPA Gulf Ecology Division, Gulf Breeze Florida is leading up these efforts.
There is research being done by Dr. Laurie Richardson at FL International University that indicates it may be caused by a bacteria, however what causes the infection by this or any other pathogen remains to be determined.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 137 - 11:54:36 ] RE: [Bekah/CCHS]
Certainly artificial reefs provide good alternate dive sites that can be equally as interesting as natural reefs.
A question to be answered is if artificial reefs bring a greater number of divers that will also dive the natural reefs on a second dive thereby increasing the pressure on natural reefs rather than reducing it.
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 139 - 11:56:43 ] RE: [MastAcademy]
Is someone currently studying the fungus, Aspergillus? The research is being done by Dr. Drew Harvell at Cornell University, with Kiho Kim.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 141 - 11:58:35 ] RE: [KellyandCatherine/BishopVerotHS]
Some of the greatest threats that shipping poses are pollution and damage to reefs by groundings.
Since the industrial revolution, many other changes have occurred in our environment which have stressed natural environments.
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 142 - 11:58:42 ] Thank you for all of your terrific questions, we take a few more, and in the meantime we will try to get all of the questions answered that have already been posted!
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 143 - 11:59:44 ] RE: [Kimberly/CCHS]
Scientists have documented a higher incidence of coral disease during the very hot summer months in the Florida Keys.
If the threshold of approximately 87.5 degrees F. water temperature is reached and maintained over several weeks of calm weather we also begin experiencing coral bleaching whereby the commensial zooxanthellae algae are expelled from the coral polyps leaving the coral weakened and more susceptible to disease.
However, temperature is not the only cause of coral diseases and studies are on-going.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 145 - 12:02:00 ] RE: [Bekah/CCHS]
Siltation is caused, as you suggested, by dredging and filling activities in nearshore areas.
It can also result from terrestrial runoff in areas that have been deforested for farming or development.
Silt affects the coral reef by smothering coral polyps and obstructing sunlight from reaching the coral's symbiotic algae.
[ Billy/CCHS - 146 - 12:02:06 ] thanks for these wonderful adventures!
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 148 - 12:02:38 ] RE: [Bekah/CCHS]
Other scientists have described the these same diseases and observed them since the 1970's.
The increase in incidence of disease is certainly something new within the past 4-5 years, and if we can correlate it to global warming affects - perhaps this is the canary in the coal mine.
Whether this is a normal, geologic time flux is still the big question to be answered.
There does seem to be a seasonality of diseases here in the Lower Keys as we see them disappear in the summer time, so that's possibly the only phase I can explain.
[ LauraFrancis/SSEeducation - 150 - 12:05:29 ] Thanks everyone for participating in the chat.
You have asked some excellent questions and we will make every attempt to get them all answered.
If you were not able to watch the video, please send an email to laura.francis@noaa.gov and we'll try to get you set up so you can see the archive when we post it in the next couple of weeks.
Also, we need your feedback on this chat, please fill out the survey form or send any comments to laura.francis@noaa.gov Thanks!
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 151 - 12:05:36 ] RE: [MsBridgetsclass]
Did this help with the disease? What was the disease? What was the paste made from? This disease is appropriately called "Black Band Disease" and can occur upon several species of head corals (usually during the warm summer months).
Harold Hudson/FKNMS biologist developed an underwater aspirator to remove the black band (cyano bacteria algae infection) and infected coral tissue.
The paste you see is actually modeling clay (a grey-green color) that is placed down after the band is removed to help heal and protect the diseased area from further infection.
If successful, which is most of the time, the infection is arrested and no further deterioration of the coral will occur.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 153 - 12:06:42 ] RE: [ryan/alyson/teamtunabvhs]
Why do sharks attack people? some one told it is b/c they look like seals? What is ur opinion? I suppose a giant squid could attack a submarine, but I suspect it would not try! Most ocean animals are pretty wary of human beings.
Sharks do occasionally attack people, and the best reason I have heard is that they do mistake us for seals.
But did you know that the chances of getting attacked by a shark are less than the chances of getting hit by lightning? In other words, sharks are just one of many fascinating components of the marine environment, and don't purposefully harm humans.
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 154 - 12:10:39 ] RE: [KimberlyMeraz]
Several years ago (1996?), when the Mississippi floods occurred, we had brown water with weird (not local)critters floating through the Florida Keys.
This water affected our area for about a week, perhaps two.
I cannot say what the direct affects on the reef have been, but this is about the same time that we had begun seeing an increase in the incidence of coral diseases Keyswide.
So, yes - even events or inputs into the oceans from hundreds of miles away can have some effect downstream and offshore.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 155 - 12:11:27 ] RE: [KimberlyMeraz]
Some public aquariums have also had success in this venture.
Elsewhere in the world, some folks are trying to raise coral for this reason.
I am not aware of any large scale coral "farming" in the US at this time, however, due to the relative difficulty of this task and the space and expense involved to raise one colony.
Perhaps we'll see innovations in this field in the future!
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 156 - 12:11:44 ] RE: [ryan/alyson/teamtunabvhs]
Maybe we could take a field trip to watch and learn:) The Sustainable Seas Expeditions (SSE) are complete for this year.
Browse the SSE Web site for an archive of mission logs and fancinating images from this year's expeditions with the NOAA ship Gordon Gunter in the Florida Keys and Florida Middle Grounds.
Hopefully we will see you next year!
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 157 - 12:15:27 ] RE: [Bekah/CCHS]
The "live rock" not only provides habitats for all sorts of marine invertebrates, plants, and fish, but also serves as an attachment place for newly settled corals (coral "recruits").
Suitable habitat is a key component of any healthy ecosystem, whether it be terrestrial, aquatic, or marine.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 158 - 12:18:11 ] RE: [ryan/alyson/teamtunabvhs]
These can be grouped into the officers and crew of the NOAA vessel Gunter to sustain 24-hour operations for extended days at sea, the submarine technical crew responsible for safe operations of the two onboard one-person submarines, scientists and scientist-pilots conducting research, other technical support people.
Altogether this could number to as many as 50 people at any one time.
A regular day begins at 6:30 am with breakfast.
At 7 submarine preparations begin for the morning dive.
If things go well, the sub could be in the water as early as 8:30 - 9 am.
The length of a dive averages 3 to 4 hours.
Then post-dive operations and preparation for the second dive begin after surfacing from the first morning dive.
Depending on the site for the afternoon dive, the second sub dive may begin around 2 to 3 pm. for another 3 or 4 hour dive.
Sometimes, two subs may be deployed depending on the mission or either by design or unforeseen delays, the afternoon dive may easily terminate as a night dive and recovery.
The swimmer (which I participated as from time to time in the Dry Tortugas) must attach the sub for pickup at whatever time the dive ends.
More than once, this has been as late as 10pm.
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 159 - 12:22:06 ] RE: [DanaMontessoireschool]
Pollution, warm water, alge, etc.
The obvious answer is temperature being the most visible cause, as summer seems to be our peak time of the year.
However, we do not know enough about the water pollution input and radiation (Ultraviolet light) inputs to answer your question.
It would be very difficult to place percetages on these causes.
A blue green alga is responsible to for black band disease but what factor contributes to it's presence and, which corals are infected while others are not, are not well understood.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 160 - 12:23:43 ] RE: [Bekah/CCHS]
Not quite! More species have been documented to spawn simultaneously in the Flower Gardens NMS as opposed to here in the FKNMS.
Perhaps as many as four species at the same time.
However, interestingly, the timing for spawning in these two locations occurs (when adjusted for time zone changes) at the very same time (usually during a three to four day period about 8 days after the full moon in August for the "head" corals.)
In the Florida Keys, we have also documented spawning of the branching (Elkhorn and Staghorn corals) which do not occur in the Flower Gardens approximately a week before the head corals.
[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 164 - 12:25:04 ] RE: [KellyandCatherine/BishopVerotHS]
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 165 - 12:25:15 ]
Limited permits are available for camping, riding a mule in etc.
Generally, national marine sanctuaries work to preserve special habitats and species while still allowing "compatible use" of the marine resources of the area.
Recall that the marine sanctuary program is administered under NOAA, which is part of the US Dept. of Commerce.
Our legislation specifically instructs that marine sanctuaries not limit use just for the sake of doing so.
However, your point is an excellent one in that many areas, marine areas included, suffer from overuse such that "carrying capacity" limits should be considered.
Any changes to visitor use of the FKNMS would have to be considered as other regulatory changes would, through the management plan review process every 5 years (we're due for ours in 2002).
Please continue to stay involved in your local marine community by making such suggestions to local officials.
Together we can ensure the protection of important marine ecosystems.

[ Lauri/ResourceManager - 168 - 12:31:44 ] RE: [Kimberly/CCHS]
Outbreaks of blackband disease seem to be most productive and prominent during this season.
It may be a combination of factors including warm water temperatures, clear water that allows high penetration of Ultra-violet light, and doldrum sea conditions that does not provide for good mixing of the water column.
We also suspect that low dissolved oxygen levels during these doldrum conditions may also be a contributor.
There is much we still need to study and discover....

what can they do? Students can do many things to preserve coral reefs.
Mostly, any thing you can do around your home, no matter where you live, to protect the environment will eventually help the coral reef.
Reducing pesticide use and chemical fertilizers in yards prevents contaminated runoff from reaching sewers and streams (which eventually reach the ocean).
Recycling reduces waste in landfills and trash overall.
If you are on the ocean or a lake, you can pick up trash you see floating and bring it ashore for proper disposal.
Encourage your friends and family to fish responsibly by obeying size limits, not taking more fish than they plan on eating that day, or by practicing "C
When you visit beaches and other nearshore areas, be sensitive to the multitudes of plants, insects, invertebrates, and other animals that live there.
All organisms are part of complex, interconnected systems that we oftentimes know little about.
Remember to take only pictures and leave only footprints (or bubbles!), and this will go a long way toward protecting coral reefs and marine species everywhere.

Run-off, nutrients, sediments, chemicals and other man-produced contaminants would or could affect reefs in both locations.

How do i take care of them? Well, I'm afraid I don't have much practical advice to offer on caring for seahorses in captivity.
Perhaps your best resource would be a local aquarium or pet shop? There may be information on line as well, if you do an internet search for "seahorse".
Seahorses are interesting fish that are unique in their reproductive strategy.
See if you can find out which seahorse, the male or female, cares for the seahorse eggs and how.

[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 174 - 12:45:41 ] RE: [KellyandCatherine/BishopVerotHS]
Excess nutrients in the coral reef environment can cause algal blooms, macro-algae overgrowth, and stress in the corals which can lead to a weakened state and allow them to be more susceptible to disease.
Preventing the run-off from storm water, effluents, and nutrients from agricultural activities would help.
Also, people on land can help educate others about the importance of coral reefs and caution reef-goers about proper activities to protect reefs like not touching living organisms and anchoring boats properly.

What an interesting question! I'm not sure I can quantify the rate of mitotic division in corals.
You may be able to find some information from a coral expert such as Dr. Erich Mueller or Dr. Steven Miller, who participated in the live video broadcast.
There are several researchers studying coral physiology and reproduction in Florida through the University of Miami and Univ. of North Carolina at Wilmington.
Perhaps each of these University websites has information specific to their coral research programs.
Another option to find the answer to this question is to do an internet or library literature search on the topic of coral reproduction and cell division.
Good luck!

Depending on the types of organisms you are looking for, someone with local knowledge of the area should be able to advise you on where to go.
Be sure that you check collecting rules with the agencies in your local region and with the State of Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many invertebrates are regulated species.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 177 - 12:53:57 ] RE: [Dane/GilksterTeamTunaBVHS]
How do i take care of them? Hi Dane - Good for you to take on the responsibility of your sea horses.
I have kept many species of fish in aquariums but never sea horses but I do know that you will have to provide the proper habitat as sea horses are fond of using their tails to hold themselves in place.
They will need to be fed with either natural or artificial food - often artemia (live brine shrimp) may a good meal.
As with all aquarium organisms, water quality should always be kept to a high standard through normal filtering practices.
Salinity and temperature should be checked regularly.
In the Florida Keys, we don't find sea horses out on the reef but they are often seen near shore on the Gulf side in Florida Bay.
Good luck!

Greetings, Cindy Hi Cindy - Glad to hear the island of Bonaire with its beautiful southern Caribbean reefs is tuned in.
Thanks for the response.
Hope to see you back up here one of these days.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 179 - 13:03:55 ] RE: [Mike/BishopVerotHS]
Some areas and species are protected so be sure to check any regulations that may be in effect before you collect specimens.
North of you, in Sarasota, you may enjoy visiting Mote Marine Lab where you can learn more about the marine life on the west coast of Florida.
Also, the University of South Florida in Tampa/St.
Petersburg is a good source of information and may have a satellite location in or near Ft. Myers.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 180 - 13:14:53 ] RE: [Dane/GilksterTeamTunaBVHS]
Be sure to feed them artemia (brine shrimp) or other small plankton regularly.
If your aquarium uses fresh seawater (not recirculated or artificial seawater such as "Instant Ocean") then the tunicates might be able to fend for themselves without addition of artemia.

Zooxanthellae, the symbiotic algae that live within individual coral polyps, aren't exactly what cause coral recruits (new corals) to settle.
The coral animals pretty much do that on their own if they find the proper substrate.
A few researchers are looking into what it might take to enhance coral settlement, and have created a sort of coral "fly paper" that is supposed to encourage corals to settle on it.
Other researchers are trying similar experiments to see if they can increase the rate at which corals settle by altering water chemistry with electric currents.
This is a very innovative field of coral science, and I encourage you to search for more answers through the internet and library research.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 183 - 13:31:48 ] RE: [Williams/GeyerBVHS]
Halimeda actually contributes a significant amount of substrate to reef areas because it is one of only a few algae that calcify, like corals.
Some areas are overgrown by Halimeda if coral colonies die, but the Halimeda itself is only being opportunistic, taking advantage of new space to grow.
Halimeda itself rarely, if ever, out competes coral animals for space on the reef.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 184 - 13:37:35 ] RE: [JBrady]
I'm curious to what hypotheses you have . . .
Maybe there is a misunderstanding since we usually see an increase in stresses on corals and reef organisms during or after the warmest weather of the year.
So it looks like you are on the right track to question this.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 185 - 13:38:35 ] RE: [KimberlyMeraz]
I'm not sure about the status of coral diseases on the Flower Garden Banks.
However, you are fortunate to have many coral reef experts in your backyard, at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary.
Contact their headquarters in College Station, TX (or see them on the internet) to find out the latest in coral diseases and coral reef research in your area.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 186 - 13:42:03 ] RE: [Bekah/CCHS]
The loss of coral tissue and healthy living coral colonies can result in decreased habitat and food for other species, and an imbalance in food webs.
We can best prevent the spread of coral diseases by not handling or touching corals that are diseased, but more importantly, we can work to improve water quality, reduce pollution, and reduce overfishing.
All of these other pressures cumulatively can affect the health of individual coral colonies, and therefore make them more susceptible to diseases in the long run.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 187 - 13:46:01 ] RE: [JBrady]
I'm curious to what hypotheses you have . . .
Yours is an interesting observation.
I am not aware of a decrease in coral diseases in the summer months, in fact, we generally see increases in disease incidence that time of year (see response #169 from resource manager Lauri MacLaughlin, also).
Many scientists hypothesize that these increases in the warmer summer months are due to increased sea temperatures, which would be exacerbated by global warming.
Some great coral disease literature and links can be found through the CHAMP website at www.coral.noaa.gov.

Check out the Aquarius website at www.uncwil.edu/nurc/aquarius for more neat Aquarius facts.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 189 - 13:49:19 ] RE: [joanna]
Divers who are living underwater in the habitat need to be able to find their way back from their excursions and that bright yellow is much easier to see at a distance.
Of course, divers have other means of reference to return to the habitat as well such as their compasses and travel lines which help guide aquanauts back from their distant research sites.
[ Joanne/FKNMSresearchinterpreter - 190 - 13:51:04 ] RE: [Joanna]
Not all of these hit the Florida Keys, however, and some years more storms progress into hurricanes.
Those of us that live in the Keys are very thankful for the accurate predictions and watchful eye of the National Weather Service's hurricane center in Miami, FL. See our FKNMS website's "links" page for more weather links: www.fknms.nos.noaa.gov
[ Claire/SSEChatHost - 191 - 13:51:43 ] Thanks yet again to the coral reef experts and research specialists, Lauri Maclaughlin, John Halas, and Joanne Delaney.
You have all done a wonderful job answering questions that have come in over the Internet!
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 192 - 14:08:54 ] RE: [Mekka/CCHS]
Dives in this area had not been conducted before and we found along a ridge, particularly at the 300 ft. depth, a great number of grouper, primarily yellow mouth grouper and scamp.
Also, several schools of large amberjack were documented as well as a variety of deepwater tropical fish including the Bank Butterfly fish which is only found in deeper waters and never on the shallow coral reefs.
Dr. Sylvia Earle, on her 1600 ft. dive, video-recorded a variety of deepwater fish (adapted to the dark environment) in addition to a very large isopod and other crustaceans including a deepwater golden crab which is being sought as a commercial sea food product.
The inclusion of this deepwater habitat as an ecological no-take zone will help ensure the preservation of this unique environment.
[ John/fknmsResourceManager - 193 - 14:21:42 ] RE: [mike/bishopverot]
However, your question will probably be forwarded to Dr. John Ogden of FIO/St.
Petersburg or Walter Jaap/FMRI who were on the Middle Ground and West Florida Shelf portion of the expedition cruise.
I am sure they will be able to provide some answers for you.
Interestingly, we do have fresh water "seeps" in shallow waters offshore along the Florida Keys (probably artesian flow from deep aquifers under the seabed).
