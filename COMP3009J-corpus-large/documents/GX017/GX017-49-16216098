NUCLEAR SAFETY ASSISTANCE: THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S ROLE The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) nuclear safety efforts in the former Soviet Union began in 1988.
Today, those efforts are based on U.S. commitments made in 1993 in support of an international agreement to provide immediate assistance for short-term improvements at older Soviet-designed power plants, including the Chernobyl (Chornobyl) reactors.
The overall objective of the program is to provide support to host countries in their efforts to improve the level of safety of their Soviet-design reactors.
To achieve this objective, activities focus on strengthening the operation and physical condition of the plants, enhancing the safety culture among designers, constructors and operators of the Soviet-designed nuclear power plants and supporting the development of an indigenous nuclear safety infrastructure for sustaining satisfactory safety levels.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is responsible for training regulators and assisting them in developing independent regulatory agencies with the legal basis to enforce safety standards and procedures.
DOE will receive $30 million in fiscal year 1996 for its nuclear safety assistance programs, down from $45 million in fiscal year 1995.
DOE had requested $83.8 million in funding for its nuclear safety assistance programs for fiscal year 1996.
Efforts in Russia
Twenty-nine nuclear power plants operate in Russia, comprising four types of reactor designs.
To date, the Soviet-Designed Reactor Safety Program has focused on the RBMK and VVER reactor designs, which make up 97 percent of the installed nuclear generating capacity in Russia.
Management and Operational Safety Programs
The objective of the Management and Operational Safety program is to improve safety of day-to-day operations of Russian nuclear power plants.
Activities are grouped into six categories: * Conduct of operations, * Operator exchanges, * Training/simulators, * Emergency operating instructions, * Emergency management and planning, and * Maintenance technology and training.
Key accomplishments through December 1995 * Twenty Russian engineers and scientists representing four of Russia's nuclear power plants visited the United States to observe the development and implementation of operating procedures at U.S. nuclear power plants.
* All 16 standard guidelines for procedure development for Soviet-designed nuclear power plant operations have been drafted by a working group of representatives from the nuclear power plants, U.S. industry, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) and DOE.
The guidelines are based on INPO's "Good Practices" and have been modified for use at the soviet-designed plants.
The guidelines will be finalized when plant-specific procedures have been tested at the pilot nuclear power plants.
* Eight improved plant operating procedures have been implemented at the Balakovo nuclear power plant.
The procedures were developed based on the guidelines developed by working groups addressing conduct of operations issues.
* Three training courses for the Balakovo Training Center were completed.
* Design specifications were completed for simulators at Balakovo, Kalinin, Kola and Novovoronezh nuclear power plants.
Contracts have been placed for simulators for the Balakovo, Kalinin and Kola plants.
* Operators at Russian Novovoronezh nuclear power plant are set to use new emergency operating instructions adopted by their facility.
* A three-year, $8 million maintenance improvement project aimed at enhancing the safety of day-to-day maintenance operations has been put in place at five RBMK sites: Kursk, Leningrad and Smolensk in Russia; Ignalina in Lithuania; and Chernobyl (Chornobyl) in Ukraine.
Work in progress * Planning for operator exchanges in 1996 is under way.
In early 1996, representatives from the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant will visit the Vermont Yankee plant where they will study the U.S. approach to developing and implementing emergency operating procedures and associated training requirements.
Specific schedules for other visits have not yet been established.
* Work continues on developing pilot training courses for key plant staffing positions.
Specific programs are under way for reactor operators and shift supervisors involved in refueling operations.
Additional specialized courses are being developed, including instructor training, procedure development, and supervisory skills.
* Options for the Balakovo analytical simulator still are being evaluated.
Work is continuing on the design of the Kola Unit 4 control room mockup for the full-scope simulator.
* Contract negotiations for completing the development of symptom-based emergency operating instructions are under way for the Kola VVER-440 Model V213 units and the Balakovo VVER-1000 units.
The associated computer and office equipment is being purchased for the Kola and Balakovo reactor units.
* The Kalinin nuclear power plant is expected to provide its existing emergency response plan.
Once this plan is received and reviewed, agreement can be reached on proceeding with emergency response work for that plant.
Draft work plans for the maintenance technology program element are being prepared, based on the draft agreement and the identified generic plant issues, and prioritized on the basis of safety importance.
The draft implementation plan and a proposed maintenance advisory board charter will be sent to each RBMK plant and REA (Smolensk Training Center owners) for review in January 1996.
These documents will be submitted for ratification and concurrence at the first RBMK maintenance advisory board meeting to be held in February 1996 at the Electric Power Research Institute in Charlotte, North Carolina.
This advisory board will include representatives from the maintenance staff of each RBMK nuclear power plant as well as a representative from REA and the United States.
Engineering and Technology Programs
Activities in this area focus on upgrading fire safety systems, confinement systems and engineered systems.
The programs are designed to provide Russia's nuclear power plant operators with the techniques, tools and equipment, and practices and procedures needed to improve plant safety.
Key accomplishments through December 1995 * The fire hazards analysis working group (with members from U.S. commercial firms, national laboratories and DOE) began developing procedures for fire hazard analyses for Soviet-designed nuclear power plants.
The procedures identify ways to prevent fires and reduce the risk of radioactive releases from fire-initiated accidents.
* Samples of fire-protection equipment were shipped to a facility in Moscow for testing and certification to Russian fire standards, before installation.
* Fire protection equipment has been delivered to the Smolensk nuclear power plant.
* Ultrasonic test equipment for the Kursk nuclear power plant is in Helsinki awaiting Russian customs clearance.
* Batteries for emergency power systems and confinement isolation valves for the Kola nuclear power plant have been shipped to Russia and await customs clearance.
* Fire protection equipment for the Leningrad nuclear power plant has been shipped to Russia and awaits customs clearance.
Plant Safety Evaluations
Activities to support enhanced plant-safety evaluations include: * Transfer of safety computer codes, * Validation of codes, * Training in the use of new codes, and * Performance of plant-specific safety evaluations.
Key accomplishments through December 1995 * The first phase of the VVER reactor design description "redbook" (Overall Plant Design for VVER Water Cooled, Water Moderated Energy Reactor) was completed by the Nuclear Safety Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The document provides a generic description of VVER reactor designs found in Russia and the former Soviet Union.
* Agreement was reached with Sweden and the United Kingdom to sponsor a joint in-depth safety assessment of Unit 2 at the Leningrad nuclear power plant site.
This is the pilot project of the RBMK plant-specific safety assessments planned under the Plant Safety Evaluation activities.
The technical work for this assessment is to be performed by the Leningrad plant and Russian design and scientific institutes, with technical assistance from British, Swedish and U.S. experts.
* DOE, IVO International of Finland and the Kola nuclear power plant are working together to perform an in-depth safety analysis of the Kola plant.
* Planning is well under way by DOE and the Russian Science and Engineering Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety to perform a detailed safety analysis of the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant.
Work in progress * A project was initiated to provide support in development, verification, and validation of the transient thermal-hydraulic and neutronic analysis computer codes at RDIPE, the primary designer of RBMK reactors.
These codes will provide capabilities for the analysis of events such as loss of cooling.
The project also will provide the appropriate tools for analyzing overpressure scenarios in the reactor confinement structure.
Arrangements have been made to supply RDIPE with an updated computer capability to perform these calculations.
* Two projects are being planned with the Nuclear Safety Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The objective of the first is to develop a technique to provide prioritized lists of safety upgrades proposed for representative RBMK power plants.
In this project, the analysis will be based on the consideration of the dominant accident sequences at the Kursk nuclear power plant.
The second project will develop recommendations to improve the operational safety of pre-stressed reinforced containment.
This will be done by conducting a strength analysis of the reinforced containment and its pre-stress system under operational and design accident conditions.
This work began in July 1995.
Fuel Cycle Safety
The Department of Energy and the Federal Nuclear and Radiation Safety Authority (Gosatomnadzor) of the Russian Federation completed a cooperative agreement to help enhance safety of Russian nuclear fuel cycle facilities and research reactors.
Work conducted under the agreement will focus on fuel cycle facilities and research reactors of the type not regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The agreement provides for: * Exchanges of expertise and views on general approaches to licensing activities associated with operating fuel cycle facilities and research reactors.
* Systematic approaches for assessing the safety of fuel cycle facilities and research reactors.
* Analysis of deviations from normal operation at these facilities and reactors.
Nuclear Safety Legislative and Regulatory Framework
This element of the program is designed to support development of basic nuclear laws and regulations in countries with Soviet-designed nuclear power plants.
The legal framework promotes: * Adherence to international nuclear safety and liability conventions or treaties, which should help ensure the effective exchange of information and technology between Western and Eastern nuclear programs, consistent with internationally recognized safety, environmental and health standards.
* Domestic indemnification for nuclear liability.
Such laws will enable Western safety technology to be used to a greater extent than under the DOE program to increase the safety of Soviet-designed nuclear power plants.
* Establishment of strong, independent regulatory bodies.
In April 1995, U.S. and Russian experts reviewed draft Russian nuclear liability legislation.
The Russians plan to revise the draft legislation, then resubmit it to the experts for a second round of comments.
A final draft of the legislation will then be submitted to the Russian parliament.
Efforts in Ukraine
Ukraine operates 14 Soviet-designed nuclear reactors at five sites, including two RBMK-1000s, two VVER-440 Model V213s and 10 VVER-1000s.
The plants account for 32.9 percent of Ukraine's electricity.
A unique feature of the DOE effort in Ukraine is the establishment of two major initiatives associated with the Chernobyl (Chornobyl) nuclear power plant.
