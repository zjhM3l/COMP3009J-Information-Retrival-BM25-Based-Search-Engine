[Untitled-1.GIF] STATEMENT of the Honorable Nydia M. VelÃ¯Â¿Â½zquez, Ranking Democratic Member, House Committee on Small Business Hearing on Service Sector Outsourcing June 18, 2003
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As the tech industry grows, tourism flourishes and the global market expands - it is apparent that our world is shrinking.
Today, people travel between nations as easily as they do between states.
Globalization, which allows economic, political and cultural systems to cross national borders freely, has caused a shift in the economic base of our nation.
We witnessed the effects of the first wave of globalization when U.S. manufacturing moved production - and American jobs - overseas.
Now we are experiencing a second wave of globalization, which is impacting the strong and profitable service sector here in the U.S.
It is by far the largest component of our economy, accounting for 81 percent of private sector output and providing roughly 95 million jobs.
In fact, the majority of companies within the services industry are small businesses.
As this sector braces for the effect this new reality will have on the economy just as the manufacturing sector did a decade ago, analysts foresee the flight of white-collar jobs abroad.
It has been predicted that the United States service industry should expect to lose at least 3.3 million white-collar jobs while $136 billion in wages will shift from the U.S. to low-cost countries by the year 2015.
For many businesses - both large and small - the global marketplace offers an array of opportunities, especially for growth.
Yet it also presents one major drawback - job outsourcing.
Companies in the service sector are able to find skilled labor abroad at lower wages.
High-end service work such as writing software code, and processing credit card receipts, is being moved to developing countries like India, China, Russia and Eastern Europe.
This has the potential to worsen our nation's already suffering economy, which has lost an estimated 3.1 million jobs since the start of the Bush administration.
There are a number of policies linked to this trend that have caused the shift in service sector jobs away from American workers.
One is immigration policy, as non-immigration programs are being used - and abused - to obtain cheap labor.
It also doesn't help that the rising costs of benefits in the U.S. make cheap labor overseas and lax worker protections more attractive.
After all, U.S. companies are trying to cut costs and make a profit in this economic downturn.
In addition, a strong dollar has led to a trade imbalance that favors importing foreign-produced goods and services because it is more cost-effective.
The technological ease with which companies now do business creates an atmosphere where overseeing workers, assessing production, and managing transactions in Jakarta is, say, just as easy - and probably cheaper - than here in the U.S.
As globalization now permeates the service sector, it is still too soon to know exactly how small businesses will be affected.
Since small businesses dominate the service sector, it is critical to factor them into the equation, making sure that policies - like immigration - help, instead of hurt, them.
In working to protect the small business service sector, we can better ensure that it doesn't meet the same fate as the manufacturing sector.
This would be another serious blow for the American economy, possibly making the current downturn longer and even more severe.
Thank you.
