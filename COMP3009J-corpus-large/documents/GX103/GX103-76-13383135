Ten Reasons to Fall in Love in Michigan _________________________________________________________________
1.
Maple syrup
Let's start the Month of Love by talking about Michigan's oldest sweet -- maple syrup.
Each year in Michigan maple syrup is the first farm crop to be harvested.
When February comes to southern Michigan, the tapping of maple trees for syrup starts.
The sugaring season may last into April on the Upper Peninsula.
Maple candy, Michigan's most historic treat, dates back to the Native Americans.
2.
Mackinac Island Fudge
Fudge also has a traditional and delicious place in the hearts and mouths of Michiganians.
Over a hundred years ago, on Mackinac Island, Murdick's Candy Kitchen started making fudge.
Since that time fudge has sprung into a huge industry on that beautiful island, beloved to honeymooners and other romantics in the warmer weather.
Now fudge is available year-round all over the state.

3.
Flowers
It's too early to plant any of the bedding/garden plants Michigan grows, but it's just the right time for a flowering potted plant or cut flowers -- all grown in Michigan.
Consider the cyclamen, traditionally sold in winter as a florist's plant, most cyclamen will burst into bloom from mid-November to spring.
With their heart-shaped leaves and blossoms in a bevy of colors -- red, purple, pink, white -- cyclamen are a perfect Valentine's Day gift.
With a little bit of extra care, your loved one's Cyclamen can last well beyond the romantic festivities.

4.
Michigan Wine
Michigan wineries produce more than 200,000 cases of wine a year.
That makes for a lot of romantic evenings.
According to the Wine Market Council, wine is the first choice for beverage for "special occasions" by both regular and less regular consumers of wine, and women prefer wine to either candy or flowers.
Wines are awash in the colors of love -- white, red and (so fitting for romance) blush.
5.
Romantic Getaways
What better place to enjoy the elixir of love than at a winery that puts their heart and soul into making it for you.
The wineries and vineyards of Michigan are nestled in the most scenic areas of the state.
Plan a weekend or a day trip touring these lovely sites and discover the diversity of Michigan wines by visiting winery tasting rooms around the state.

6.
Music
Whatever your taste in music, Michigan probably has someone to satisfy your yearning -- from Motown to Madonna.
For those of tiring of winter and looking forward to the spring and growing season, may we suggest Motown's own Temptations ...
"I've got sunshine on a cloudy day/When it's cold outside I've got the month of May/I guess you'll say/ What can make me feel this way?/My girl, my girl/Talkin' 'bout my girl."
7.
Cherries
Here's a winning love affair ... chocolate and Michigan cherries magically become delicious chocolate-covered cherries.
February is National Cherry Month, and Michigan grows about 75 percent of the red tart cherries in the nation.
Usually tart cherries aren't sold fresh but are made into an amazing array of products including chocolate-covered cherries, cherry pie filling, dried cherries and cherry juice.
8.
Presidential Romance
Gerald Ford is the only president to come from Michigan.
February 17 is President's Day, and romantics may recall Ford's moving tribute to his wife Bette in the early lines of his 1974 inaugural speech: "I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman -- my dear wife -- as I begin this very difficult job."
9.
Romantic Meals
Ignore the snow and ice.
Stay at home and whip up an absolutely delicious meal made from ingredients from your own state.

10.
Climate Michigan's climate may not be Hawaii's, but the diverse climate and the unique effects of the Great Lakes create an amazing profusion of agricultural products -- more than 125 of them.
When you bite into that delicious chocolate-covered cherry, find a flowering cyclamen delivered to you at the doorstep, or open a chilled bottle of Michigan wine ... you'll be glad you're here.
Besides that, the state's blustery February cold makes for good snuggling weather.
