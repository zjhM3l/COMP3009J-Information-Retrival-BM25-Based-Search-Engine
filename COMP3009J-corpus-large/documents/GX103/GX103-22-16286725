Thursday's Witness List

Bush Administration's Proposed FY 2003 Budget
The Bush Administration has requested $7.1 billion for fiscal year 2003 for Coast Guard activities that are subject to appropriation.
This request is $1.6 billion (28 percent) more than the amount appropriated for the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2002.
This request places specific emphasis on the Coast Guard's search and rescue and homeland security focused missions.
Approximately $700 million of the increase is provided for new military entitlement programs and to enhance Coast Guard operations.
The remaining increase of $900 million is due to an accounting change which fully accrues the Coast Guard's retirements and health care costs.
Both of these accounting initiatives would require the enactment of legislation to become effective.
$4.6 Billion Proposed For Operating Expenses
The budget request for Coast Guard operating expenses in fiscal year 2003 is $4.6 billion, an increase of $733 million, or nineteen percent, over the fiscal year 2002 appropriated level (these figures include the retirement and health care accruals for fiscal years 2002 and 2003).
Operating expenses account for about two-thirds of the Coast Guard's budget and fund Coast Guard search and rescue, port security, aids to navigation, marine safety, marine environmental protection, and law enforcement operations.
This includes funding for 37,249 military and 6,390 civilian personnel.
The Coast Guard's operating expense request includes an additional $266 million to continue maritime homeland security projects originally funded in the fiscal year 2002 supplemental appropriation and to continue the operation of other assets acquired in 2002.
The President also requests an additional $213 million to further improve Coast Guard maritime homeland security systems as well as the Coast Guard's search and rescue and maritime safety operations.
The President's announced pay raises in fiscal year 2003 for Coast Guard military personnel, 4.1percent, and civilian personnel, 2.6percent, would cost the Coast Guard $98 million.
In addition, this request increases Coast Guard military personnel by 1,978 and civilians by 220.
Acquisition, Construction 
The Administration requests $736 million in acquisitions funding for fiscal year 2003, a $92 million, or 14 percent, increase over the amount appropriated in fiscal year 2002 (these figures include the retirement and health care accruals for fiscal years 2002 and 2003).
This request places specific emphasis on the Coast Guard search and rescue and homeland security missions.
These activities include the acquisition, construction, renovation, and improvement of vessels, aircraft, other equipment, and shore facilities.
This account also funds the Coast Guard's Deepwater Capability Replacement Project and the Coast Guard personnel responsible for acquisition.
