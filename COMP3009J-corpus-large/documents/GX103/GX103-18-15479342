The sunflower beetle is the major defoliating pest of cultivated sunflower in the United States.
Adults and larvae feed on sunflower foliage and when populations are high, yield loss can occur.
Although the beetle can be controlled with insecticides, there are inherent problems associated with long-term pesticide use including natural enemy destruction, high input costs, and insecticide resistance.
The best way to control the sunflower beetle is with an integrated pest management (IPM) approach that uses a variety of tactics, relying on pesticides only as a last resort.
The discovery of successful IPM techniques is important in the development of sustainable agriculture and will offer additional choices in managing sunflower beetle populations to prevent yield reductions.
Studies were initiated to increase our knowledge about the beetle, its natural enemies, and to determine the impact of cultivation, seed treatment, and planting date as management tactics to reduce producer losses.
These studies added to our understanding of the beetle's life history and its overwintering habits.
Insecticides were effective when used as a foliar treatment but not when incorporated onto the seed.
Although cultivation was not effective in reducing beetle numbers, delayed planting was successful as a management tool.
Natural enemies are significant mortality factors for this sunflower pest and should be conserved when possible.
The long-term goal for beetle control should be the use of a variety of IPM strategies.
while effective, chemical control should remain as a last resort, utilized only when the economic threshold has been reached.
