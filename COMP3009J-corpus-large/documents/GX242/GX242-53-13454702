Domestic Wastewater Wetland Sites in Florida
There are essentially two general types of domestic wastewater wetlands - natural and man-made (constructed) wetlands.
Chapter 62-611, FAC, wastewater to wetlands rule, breaks natural wetlands into receiving and treatment wetlands.
The difference between the two is explained below.
For permitted purposes the wastewater to wetlands rule further classifies natural wetlands as hydrologically-altered or not.
The intent of classifying certain wastewater wetlands as hydrologically-altered is to restore or prevent a previous or potential loss of wetland acreage.
The use of hydrologically-altered wetland as well as creating wetlands for effluent polishing are both considered reuse of reclaimed water activities, according to Chapter 62-610, FAC.
Some domestic wastewater facilities utilize a combination of more than one of these types, typically man-made wetlands and natural wetlands.
There are 16 natural (both treatment and receiving) wastewater wetlands comprising roughly 6,200 acres and a total of 19 constructed wetland sites comprising roughly 4,000 acres across Florida.
Of those, 4 facilities use a combination of both natural and constructed wetland systems, making that a total of 31 permitted domestic wastewater wetland sites in the state of Florida.
A complete list of these wastewater wetlands sites is provided below according to their classification.
Natural Receiving Wetlands
Receiving wetlands receive the highest level of treatment - advanced waste treatment (AWT) standards.
This is equivalent to not more than, on an annual average basis, 5 mg/L of CBOD, 5 mg/L of TSS, 3 mg/L of TN and 1 mg/L of TP, along with basic disinfection.

Back to top Natural Treatment Wetlands
Treatment wetlands must receive effluent that has been treated to at least secondary standards (20 mg/L of CBOD and 20 mg/L of TSS) with nitrification and basic disinfection.
Monitoring standards within a treatment wetland are more extensive and frequent to ensure that the type, nature and function of the wetland is being protected.
1.
Boot Wetland Treatment System, Poinciana Utilities (since 1985) Permitted for 0.35 MGD to approx.
115 acres of cypress-gum wetlands 2.

Back to top Man-Made (Constructed) Wetlands
Constructed wetlands are engineered systems created from uplands that have been designed to utilize the natural processes of wetlands to assist in the polishing wastewater effluent.
Some of these systems are operated with the sole purpose of treating effluent, while others are also being used as a water source for the creation of wetland habitat for wildlife use, environmental enhancement and public recreation.
