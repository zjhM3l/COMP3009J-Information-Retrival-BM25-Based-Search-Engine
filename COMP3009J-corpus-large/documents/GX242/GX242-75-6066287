Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum Signs Clean Marina Pledge ______________________________________________________________ ANNAPOLIS, MD (January 29, 2001) Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels is the first museum in the state to support the Clean Marina Initiative.
Executive Director John Valliant and Manager Robin Newberg have committed to educate museum patrons about steps they can take to"keep Maryland's waterways free of harmful chemicals, excess nutrients and debris."
Signing the Clean Marina Pledge is the first step toward receiving recognition as a Clean Marina Partner.
The Clean Marina Partner designation was created to recognize boating facilitiesother than marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubsthat are implementing pollution prevention measures.
To achieve full standing as a Clean Marina Partner, managers must minimize their own pollution and educate boaters about what they can do to protect our natural resources.
The Department of Natural Resources' Maryland Clean Marina Initiative promotes and celebrates voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution from recreational boating.
Operators of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs qualify for Clean Marina certification by adopting measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff; and facilities management.
The goal of the Clean Marina Initiative is to certify 25 percent of Maryland's 600 boating facilities as Clean Marinas or Clean Marina Partners by 2004.
To date, 110 boating facilities have taken the first step and signed the Clean Marina Pledge.
Of these, 25 marinas have been certified as Clean Marinas and one public boat ramp has been certified as a Clean Marina Partner.
Boaters are encouraged to patronize Maryland Clean Marinas and Clean Marina Partners.
