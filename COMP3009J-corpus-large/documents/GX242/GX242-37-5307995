Description of Lessons While more than two hundred thousand Hoosier men went to war, the men, women and children who stayed behind played a vital role in running farms and households, maintaining the economy, and supporting their loved ones who fought for the Union.
This set of lessons will introduce students to the ways in which those who remained in the Hoosier state assumed a greater work load, made sacrifices, pitched in to help others and provided significant contributions in the service of their country.

HANDOUT 1a INDIANA AT THE TIME OF THE CIVIL WAR Who were these Hoosiers in 1860, and from where had they come? The earliest settlers had come from the east, usually from Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Later settlers had come from the south, some starting from North Carolina and moving through Tennessee, Kentucky and then north into Indiana.
Some had settled in the southern states but felt the need to get away from the plantation economy, seeking better jobs in northern states.
By 1860 in Indiana, there were more people who could claim southern ancestry than any other state in the North.
There were also African Americans who had made their way to Indiana.
Some had escaped slavery via the Underground Railroad.
Others had gained their freedom and had moved to Indiana to begin a new life.
German, Irish, English and French immigrants had also come north and west, and they made up ten percent of the population.
When the Civil War started, where did Hoosiers live and how did they get there? Indiana experienced great growth in the mid-nineteenth century.
The population had grown from 990,000 in 1850 to 1,350,000 in 1860.
While this might not appear to be a huge increase in 10 years' time, consider that it averages out to an increase in population of 3,000 people per month! Indianapolis also experienced considerable growth.
In 1850, the census recorded 8,000 people living in the capital city.
During the fifties the population rose to more than eighteen thousand, and by the end of the 1860s, Indianapolis' population had reached 45,000.
While there are many reasons for this growth, one of the main factors was the development of the rail system.
Indianapolis was situated on the White River, but this was not a major water route.

Handout 1a continued
Madison and Indianapolis Railroad was completed, and this linked Indianapolis directly to the Ohio River.
The National Road (Highway 40) linked Indianapolis to Terre Haute, which was situated on the Wabash River.
However, the Wabash River was never reliable for navigation.
Indianapolis was connected to Terre Haute by rail in the 1850s, and this rail system continued on to Vincennes and Evansville on the Ohio River.
The Vincennes line ran east to Lawrence County, and from there could be taken north on the Chicago and New Albany Railroad, or south on the Louisville Railroad to Louisville.
The largest counties at the time of the Civil War were Dearborn, Jefferson, Marion and Wayne.
In 1850, most African Americans in Indiana lived in southeastern Indiana along the Ohio River in counties such as Floyd and Clark.
Two prominent African American settlements included Lyles Station and Roberts Settlement.
In Wayne County and Randolph County, African Americans had settled, in part, due to the presence of Quakers, a group that worked for the abolition of slavery and which was active in the Underground Railroad.
The counties with the largest foreign-born population were Marion, La Porte, Vanderberg, and Allen.
Towns and cities had developed along rivers such as the Ohio and Wabash Rivers.
With the development of the railroad system, towns were also springing up along the train routes.

HANDOUT 2 DAILY LIFE AND THE EFFECTS OF THE WAR What were Hoosiers' lives like when the war started? How did they make a living? How did the war change their lives? In Indiana in 1860, the majority of people lived on farms, and most rural people still lived in log cabins.
When heads of households and sons departed to fight the war, this left the women, children and older men to tend to the farms.
During the war, rural children who otherwise would have been able attend to school would now be needed to stay home and help with the household and farm work.
The women of Indiana felt the effects of the war at home.
Those who lived on farms were now responsible for the farm in addition to their regular, full-time duties of household work and child rearing.
Before the war, the daily lives of women included tasks such as sewing garments for the family, tending gardens, canning food, cleaning and maintaining the house, and preparing and cleaning up after three meals a day.
Doing laundry for a family could take an entire day.
With their husbands off to war, rural women were charged with the tasks of overseeing or tending the farm animals such as hogs and cows, plowing and harvesting crops, and managing the finances of the home.
High prices for cash crops during wartime enabled some women to hire laborers to take care of farm work.
However, the overseeing of such business was new to all but a few of the women.
Children, relatives, neighbors, and townspeople pitched in to help the families of soldiers.
Whole communities would work together to gather, chop and deliver firewood for the families of soldiers.
Decisions and tasks that had always been the responsibility of the husbands were now upon the shoulders of the wives.
At times, soldiers would try to do what they could in advising their wives in the matters of managing the farm.

Handout 2 continued Samuel H. Mattox of the 85th Indiana Volunteers wrote regularly to his wife Ann, advising her on care of the farm and household.
The following are excerpts from his letters: October 21, 1862 "If you possibly can, I think you had better sell all the horses.
If you have to, sell them on 12 or 15 or 20 months credit, as feed is so hard to get and I would like for you to keep the cows if you possibly can."
November 23, 1862 "You can sell or trade the old wagon for whatever you can get...You had better try to trade the colt for corn and wheat."
December 5, 1862 "When you write again tell me how you are getting along at fattening the hogs and how many you are fattening."
January 14, 1863 "I am glad you have the tax paid."
March 17, 1863 "I am sorry your relief money has given out for I don't know now when I will get any more money to send to you...I am glad you have your start of geese, but I fear they will be more plague than profit."
June 6, 1863 "I was surprised to hear that our mare has a colt...Tell me in your next letter whether you have her at home or not and how our filly looks."
October 20, 1863 "Did the frost kill all the corn in our neighborhood?...How do you think you can do in regard to having bread and meat through the winter?" November 10, 1863 "I want you to hang on to the cows and white calf if you can, so you can have plenty of milk and butter for the children."

Handout 2 continued
February, 1864 "I am sorry, truly sorry that it has turned out so that you have to freeze in a cold house again this winter...If you can't get anything done to the house soon I don't know but you had better make a sale and sell off all the stock and rent a house in town and move into it for I really dread the consequences of this winter on you and the children's account."

From the Fairbanks Library, Terre Haute, Indiana.
Soldiers would send home their pay when they could.
Instead of sending cash through the mail, they would give the money to agents to carry back home for them.
This could be a risky procedure, however, and it is not unusual to read soldiers' letters to their families, asking if the money made it home.
At times, soldiers needed to use their money for extra clothing or other necessities, and sometimes pay was simply slow in coming.
In the case of the 28th United States Colored Troops (USCT) who were raised predominantly in Indiana, the pay they were promised turned out to be much less than what they had expected.
From Camp Fremont in Indianapolis, one African American soldier wrote that when the first payday came, they were offered only $7.50 a month.
When they enlisted, they assumed they would get the same pay as all soldiers, which was $13.00 per month.
These men refused any pay until they received a more reasonable amount.
It took an act of Congress to make the pay equal for all soldiers.
In addition to shouldering new responsibilities at home, women also worked to supply the soldiers' needs.
Even before a soldier was mustered in, wives, sisters and sweethearts would work to outfit their "Billie Yank."
They would knit socks, sew shirts, pants, coats and drawers, and supply "housewives" (sewing kits).
Women's clubs would gather to sew battle flags which they would present to regiments.
After the men left for service, church groups and community groups would organize sewing circles for continuing to supply the men.

LESSON 3 HOOSIER CONTRIBUTIONS Activities 1.
Hoosiers worked diligently together to support their troops.
Assign Handout 3 as background reading, and use the following questions for a guided discussion.
a.
Almost 75% of Hoosier men enlisted.
Why were Hoosiers of this time so committed to serving in the Union Army? b.
What might have been economic reasons for enlisting? c. Many of these Hoosiers were relatively "new arrivals" to the state, many being first or second generation in their family to live in Indiana.
Why would they be so eager to fight for the Union? Consider their different backgrounds and reasons for coming to Indiana in the first place.
In what ways might this have affected their support for the preservation of the Union? 2.
Invite an army recruiter as a guest speaker to discuss the benefits provided to soldiers' families today.
3.
Write a Valentine to a veteran or a letter of thanks.
Obtain the address of a local Veterans' Administration Hospital and guide students in writing letters of appreciation to veterans.
4.
If you were to put together a "care package" for a soldier stationed overseas today, what might you include in your list?

HANDOUT 3 HOOSIER CONTRIBUTIONS What were some of Indiana's contributions to the war effort? More than 203,000 men (almost 75% of Hoosier men of military age) served in the Civil War.
At the end of the war, it was determined that Indiana ranked second only to Delaware in the percentage of men who had served in the war.
Indiana also made great contributions in providing supplies for the Union soldiers.
Hoosier agricultural products helped feed Union soldiers as well as citizens in other Union states.
In 1860, Indiana produced 16,848,000 bushels of wheat, 71,588,000 bushels of corn, and had 3,099,000 hogs.
Hoosiers were not only capable of feeding their own population of 1,350,000, they had plenty of crops and livestock to sell outside the state.
Those who remained at home, men and women and children, helped to keep the economy of Indiana going, and they helped to supply the Union forces.
Support for the war effort took many forms.
The people of Indiana paid out more than fifteen million dollars in local bounties, which were disbursed to the soldiers as a bonus for enlisting.
A relief fund totaling nearly five million dollars was raised for the families of soldiers.
Ministers throughout the state volunteered to visit the troops in the field to preach to them.
The Indiana Sanitary Commission collected contributions of money from individuals, Ladies Aid Societies, churches, towns, and groups of children.
These monies were used to purchase and deliver needed items to Indiana soldiers and others in need.

Handout 3 continued How did Indiana's citizens care for those in the state and on the field? Throughout the war, Indianapolis remained the hub for soldiers moving to and from the front.
There was a need to be able to care for them while they were in the city, and in some cases medical care was also required.
Governor Oliver P. Morton obtained financial support from the federal government and from the Indiana Sanitary Commission to build and equip several buildings which would become the Soldiers' Home.
These facilities included a dining hall, sleeping quarters and a hospital.
When completed, the Soldiers' Home could house 1,800 men and feed 8,000 a day.
In addition to this, a Ladies Home was situated near the railroad station to house and feed travelling or visiting wives, children or mothers of soldiers.
Governor Morton took charge of an unprofitable bakery at Camp Morton and caused it to turn a profit.
Under Morton's management, the bakery increased its production from 7,000 to 12,000 loaves of bread per day.
In addition to supplying the army, the bakery also donated bread to the families of the soldiers who were living in or around the city.
The citizens of Indiana also rallied to send their support for the ill and wounded soldiers in the field.
The Indiana Sanitary Commission was created to raise money and collect and distribute supplies to soldiers.
Fairs were held as fundraisers, churches appealed to members for donations, and clubs and individuals made monetary contributions to aid the sick and wounded soldiers.
The Sisters of Providence of St. Mary-of-the-Woods were asked to take charge of the Military Hospital (the Old City Hospital) at Indianapolis.
Initially, they found the hospital to be "in a miserable state of filth and disorder, and the sick in a wretched condition."
The Sisters soon made the hospital clean and comfortable for the soldiers.
The Indianapolis Daily Journal of June 18, 1861 had this to say about their efforts: "...Drs. Jameson and Kitchen, speedily prepared for use (of the hospital), and the supervision of the Sisters of Providence of Terre Haute (St. Mary-of-the-Woods) who gave their invaluable services, as those associations always do, without pay, purely in discharge of a high Christian duty.
An appeal to our ladies of the city supplied it with an abundance of excellent bed-clothing, towels, and other necessary articles.
The Sisters took charge of the cooking, cleaning, washing and general house-keeping of the establishment, and most admirably have they performed their unpleasant but noble duty.
Now it is as complete in its arrangement, clean, well-ventilated, well-provided, and comfortable as any hospital in the country."

Handout 3 continued As a result of the war, many women served in the field as nurses.
Catherine Merrill, Bettie Bates, Caroline Coburn, Mrs. Calvin Fletcher, and Mrs. J. L. Ketcham are a few examples.
Elizabeth E. George, who was known to Indiana soldiers as "Mother George", followed Hoosier soldiers into Rebel territory.
Even though she was 54 years old when she began her journey, for nearly two and a half years she cared for the ill, the wounded, and the dying.
Often she was found at the front dressing the soldiers' wounds, giving them water and working to the limit of her endurance.
Mother George herself finally fell victim to typhoid fever at Wilmington, North Carolina.
Upon receiving the news that Mother George was gravely ill, the Indiana Sanitary Commission quickly dispatched Dr. William H. Wishard to her assistance, but it was too late.
Mother George's remains were sent to Fort Wayne and given full military honors as she was laid to rest in the Lindenwood Cemetery.
