Major Uses or Sources
Benzene has been widely used as a multipurpose organic solvent.
This use is now discouraged due to its high toxicity, including carcinogenicity.
Present uses include use as a raw material in the synthesis of styrene, phenol, cyclohexane, aniline, and alkyl benzenes in the manufacture of various plastics, resins, and detergents.
Syntheses of many pesticides and pharmaceuticals also involve benzene as a chemical intermediate (HSDB, 1994).
The tire industry and shoe factories use benzene extensively in their manufacturing processes.
Annual demand in the U.S. was estimated to be 6 million tons in 1990 (HSDB, 1994).
Benzene exposure also occurs as a result of gasoline and diesel fuel use and combustion (Holmberg and Lundberg, 1985).
In 1996, the latest year tabulated, the statewide mean outdoor monitored concentration of benzene was approximately 0.7 ppb (CARB, 1999a).
Annual statewide industrial emissions from facilities reporting under the Air Toxics Hot Spots Act in California based on the most recent inventory were estimated to be 750,364 pounds of benzene (CARB, 1999b).
(This does not include the large amount of benzene emitted by mobile sources.)

Effects of Human Exposure
The primary toxicological effects of chronic benzene exposure are on the hematopoeitic system.
Neurological and reproductive/developmental toxic effects are also of concern at slightly higher concentrations.
Impairment of immune function and/or various anemias may result from the hematotoxicity.
The hematologic lesions in the bone marrow can lead to peripheral lymphocytopenia and/or pancytopenia following chronic exposure.
Severe benzene exposures can also lead to life-threatening aplastic anemia.
These lesions may lead to the development of leukemia years after apparent recovery from the hematologic damage (DeGowin, 1963).
Kipen et al. (1988) performed a retrospective longitudinal study on a cohort of 459 rubber workers, examining the correlation of average benzene exposure with total white blood cell counts taken from the workers.
These researchers found a significant (p 
A reanalysis of these data by Cody et al. (1993) showed significant decreases in RBC and WBC counts among a group of 161 workers during the 1946-1949 period compared with their pre-exposure blood cell counts.
The decline in blood counts was measured over the course of 12 months following start of exposure.
During the course of employment, workers who had low monthly blood cell counts were transferred to other areas with lower benzene exposures, thus potentially creating a bias towards non-significance or removing sensitive subjects from the study population.
Since there was a reported 75% rate of job change within the first year of employment, this bias could be highly significant.
In addition, there was some indication of blood transfusions used to treat some "anemic" workers, which would cause serious problems in interpreting the RBC data, since RBCs have a long lifespan in the bloodstream.
The exposure analysis in this study was performed by Crump and Allen (1984).
The range of monthly median exposures was 30-54 ppm throughout the 12-month segment examined.
Despite the above-mentioned potential biases, workers exposed above the median concentrations displayed significantly decreased WBC and RBC counts compared with workers exposed to the lower concentrations using a repeated measures analysis of variance.
Tsai et al. (1983) examined the mortality from all cancers and leukemia, in addition to hematologic parameters in male workers exposed to benzene for 1-21 years in a refinery from 1952-1978.
The cohort of 454 included maintenance workers and utility men and laborers assigned to benzene units on a "regular basis".
Exposures to benzene were determined using personal monitors; the median air concentration was 0.53 ppm in the work areas of greatest exposure to benzene.
The average length of employment in the cohort was 7.4 years.
The analysis of overall mortality in this population revealed no significant excesses.
Mortality from all causes and from diseases of the circulatory system was significantly below expected values based on comparable groups of U.S. males.
The authors concluded the presence of a healthy worker effect.
An internal comparison group of 823 people, including 10% of the workers who were employed in the same plant in operations not related to benzene, showed relative risks for 0.90 and 1.31 for all causes and cancer at all sites, respectively (p 
A subset of 303 workers was followed for medical surveillance.
Up to four hematological tests per year were conducted on these workers.
Total and differential white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, A-7 Benzene
hematocrit, red blood cells, platelets and clotting times were found to be within normal (between 5% and 95% percentile) limits in this group.
Collins et al. (1997) used routine data from Monsanto's medical/industrial hygiene system to study 387 workers with daily 8-hour time-weighted exposures (TWA) averaging 0.55 ppm benzene (range = 0.01 Â­ 87.69 ppm; based on 4213 personal monitoring samples, less than 5% of which exceeded 2 ppm).
Controls were 553 unexposed workers.
There was no increase in the prevalence of lymphopenia, an early, sensitive indicator of benzene toxicity, among exposed workers (odds ratio = 0.6; 95% confidence interval = 0.2 to 1.8), taking into account smoking, age, and sex.
There also was no increase in risk among workers exposed 5 or more years (odds ratio = 0.6; 95% confidence interval = 0.2 to 1.9).
There were no differences between exposed and unexposed workers for other measures of hematotoxicity, including mean corpuscular volume and counts of total white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets.
Rothman et al. (1996) compared hematologic outcomes in a cross-sectional study of 44 male and female workers heavily exposed to benzene (median = 31 ppm as an 8-hr TWA) and 44 age and gender-matched unexposed controls from China.
Hematologic parameters (total WBC, absolute lymphocyte count, platelets, red blood cells, and hematocrit) were decreased among exposed workers compared to controls; an exception was the red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which was higher among exposed subjects.
In a subgroup of 11 workers with a median 8 hr TWA of 7.6 ppm (range = 1-20 ppm) and not exposed to more than 31 ppm on any of 5 sampling days, only the absolute lymphocyte count was significantly different between exposed workers and controls (p = 0.03).
Among exposed subjects, a dose response relationship with various measures of current benzene exposure (i.e., personal air monitoring, benzene metabolites in urine) was present only for the total WBC count, the absolute lymphocyte count, and the MCV.
Their results support the use of the absolute lymphocyte count as the most sensitive indicator of benzene-induced hematotoxicity.
An examination of 32 patients, who were chronically exposed to benzene vapors ranging from 150 to 650 ppm for 4 months to 15 years, showed that pancytopenia occurred in 28 cases.
Bone marrow punctures revealed variable hematopoeitic lesions, ranging from acellularity to hypercellularity (Aksoy et al., 1972).
Central nervous system disorders have been reported in individuals with pancytopenia following chronic occupational benzene exposure to unknown concentrations for an average length of time of 6 years (Baslo and Aksoy, 1982).
Runion and Scott (1985) estimated a composite geometric mean benzene concentration in various workplaces containing benzene to be 0.1 ppm (0.32 mg/m3) (geometric standard deviation = 7.2 ppm, 23.3 mg/m3).
This estimate was based on samples collected by industrial hygienists between the years 1978 and 1983.

Effects of Animal Exposure
A number of animal studies have demonstrated that benzene exposure can induce bone marrow damage, changes in circulating blood cells, developmental and reproductive effects, alterations of the immune response, and cancer.
With respect to chronic toxicity, hematological changes appear to be the most sensitive indicator.
Wolf et al. (1956) studied the effects of repeated exposure to benzene in rabbits (80 ppm, 175 total exposures), rats (88 ppm, 136 total exposures) and guinea pigs (88 ppm, 193 total exposures).
The observed effects included leukopenia, increased spleen weight, and histological changes to the bone marrow.
Hematologic effects, including leukopenia, were observed in rats exposed to mean concentrations of 44 ppm (143 mg/m3) or greater for 5-8 weeks (Deichmann et al., 1963).
Exposure to 31 ppm (100 mg/m3) benzene or less did not result in leukopenia after 34 months of exposure.
Snyder et al. (1978) exposed Sprague-Dawley rats and AKR/J mice to 300 ppm benzene, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for life.
Lymphocytopenia, anemia and decreased survival time were observed in both species.
Cronkite et al. (1982) exposed male mice to 400 ppm benzene, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 9.5 weeks and observed depressed bone marrow cellularity, decreased stem cell count, and altered morphology in spleen colony-forming cells.
Mice have been shown to be more sensitive than rats or rabbits to the hematologic and leukemic effects of benzene (Sabourin et al., 1989; IARC, 1982).
Sabourin et al. (1988) showed that metabolism of benzene to the toxic hydroquinone, muconic acid, and hydroquinone glucuronide was much more prevalent in the mouse than in rats, whereas the detoxification pathways were approximately equivalent between the two species.
A study on the chronic hematological effects of benzene exposure in C57 Bl/6 male mice (5-6 per group) showed that peripheral lymphocytes, red blood cells and colony-forming units (CFUs) in the bone marrow and spleen were significantly decreased in number after treatment with 10 ppm (32.4 mg/m3) benzene for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 178 days (Baarson et al., 1984).
Inhalation of 0, 10, 31, 100, or 301 ppm (0, 32.4, 100.4, 324, or 975 mg/m3) benzene for 6 hours/day for 6 days resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocytes, and a reduced proliferative response of B- and T-lymphocytes to mitogenic agents in mice (Rozen et al., 1984).
In this study, total peripheral lymphocyte numbers and B-lymphocyte proliferation to lipopolysaccharide were significantly reduced at a concentration of 10 ppm (32.4 mg/m3).
The proliferation of T-lymphocytes was significantly reduced at a concentration of 31 ppm (100.4 mg/m3).
Male and female mice (9-10 per group) exposed to 100 ppm (324 mg/m3) benzene or greater for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks showed decreased bone marrow cellularity and a reduction of pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow (Cronkite et al., 1985).
The decrease in marrow cellularity continued for up to 25 weeks following a 16-week exposure to 300 ppm (972 mg/m3) benzene.
Peripheral blood lymphocytes were dose-dependently decreased with benzene exposures of greater than 25 ppm (81 mg/m3) for 16 weeks, but recovered to normal levels following a 16-week recovery period.
A-9 Benzene
Ward et al. (1985) exposed 50 Sprague-Dawley rats and 150 CD-1 mice of both sexes to 0, 1, 10, 30, or 300 ppm benzene, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks.
Serial sacrifices were conducted at 7, 14, 28, 56, and 91 days.
No hematological changes were found for mice and rats at 1, 10, or 30 ppm in this study.
Significant increases in mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin values and decreases in hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocyte percentages, and decreases in red cell, leukocyte and platelet counts were observed in male and female mice at 300 ppm.
The changes were first observed after 14 days of exposure.
Histological changes in mice included myeloid hypoplasia of the bone marrow, lymphoid depletion in the mesenteric lymph node, increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, and periarteriolar lymphoid sheath depletion.
Effects were less severe in the rats.
Aoyama (1986) showed that a 14-day exposure of mice to 50 ppm (162 mg/m3) benzene resulted in a significantly reduced blood leukocyte count.
The NTP (1986) conducted a bioassay in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice of benzene by corn oil gavage.
Doses were 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg-day for females and 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kgday for males.
Dose-related lymphocytopenia and leukocytopenia were observed in both species in all dosed groups but not controls.
Mice exhibited lymphoid depletion of the thymus and spleen and hyperplasia of the bone marrow.
Cronkite et al. (1989) exposed CBA/Ca mice to 10, 25, 100, 300, 400 and 3000 ppm benzene 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for up to 16 weeks.
No effects were observed at the 10 ppm level.
Lymphopenia was observed in the 25 ppm exposure group.
Higher concentrations of benzene produced dose-dependent decreases in blood lymphocytes, bone marrow cellularity, spleen colony-forming units, and an increased percentage of CFU-S in S-phase synthesis.
Farris et al. (1997) exposed B6C3F1 mice to 1, 5, 10, 100, and 200 ppm benzene for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks.
In addition some animals were allowed to recover from the exposure.
There were no significant effects on hematopoietic parameters from exposure to 10 ppm benzene or less.
Exposure to higher levels reduced the number of total bone marrow cells, progenitor cells, differentiating hematopoietic cells, and most blood parameters.
The replication of primitive progenitor cells was increased.
The authors suggested that this last effect, in concert with the genotoxicity of benzene, could account for the carcinogenicity of benzene at high concentrations.
Reproductive and developmental effects have been reported following benzene exposure.
Coate et al. (1984) exposed groups of 40 female rats to 0, 1, 10, 40, and 100 ppm (0, 3.24, 32.4, 129.6, or 324 mg/m3) benzene for 6 hours/day during days 6-15 of gestation.
In this study, teratologic evaluations and fetotoxic measurements were done on the fetuses.
A significant decrease was noted in the body weights of fetuses from dams exposed to 100 ppm (324 mg/m3).
No effects were observed at a concentration of 40 ppm (129.6 mg/m3).
Keller and Snyder (1986) reported that exposure of pregnant mice to concentrations as low as 5 ppm (16 mg/m3) benzene on days 6-15 of gestation (6 hr/day) resulted in bone-marrow hematopoietic changes in the offspring that persisted into adulthood.
However, the hematopoietic effects (e.g. bimodal changes in erythroid colony-forming cells) in the above study were of uncertain biological significance.
In a similar later study, Keller and Snyder (1988) found that exposure of mice in utero to 20 ppm (64 mg/m3) benzene on days 6-15 of A - 10 Benzene
gestation resulted in neonatal suppression of erythropoietic precursor cells and persistent, enhanced granulopoiesis.
This effect was considered significant bone-marrow toxicity by the authors.
No hematotoxicity was seen in this study at 10 ppm (32 mg/m3).
An exposure of 500 ppm (1,600 mg/m3) benzene through days 6-15 gestation was teratogenic in rats while 50 ppm (160 mg/m3) resulted in reduced fetal weights on day 20 of gestation.
No fetal effects were noted at an exposure of 10 ppm (Kuna and Kapp, 1981).
An earlier study by Murray et al. (1979) showed that inhalation of 500 ppm benzene for 7 hours/day on days 6-15 and days 6-18 of gestation in mice and rabbits, respectively, induced minor skeletal variations in the absence of maternal toxicity.
Red and white blood cell counts in the adults of either species were measured by Murray et al. (1979) but were not significantly different from control animals.
However, fetal mouse hematological effects were not measured.
Tatrai et al. (1980) demonstrated decreased fetal body weights and elevated liver weights in rats exposed throughout gestation to 150 mg/m3 (47 ppm).
VI. Derivation of Chronic Reference Exposure Level (REL) Study Study population Exposure method Critical effects LOAEL NOAEL Exposure continuity Exposure duration Average occupational exposure Human equivalent concentration LOAEL uncertainty factor Subchronic uncertainty factor Interspecies uncertainty factor Intraspecies uncertainty factor Cumulative uncertainty factor Inhalation reference exposure level Tsai et al. (1983) 303 Male refinery workers Occupational exposures for 1-21 years Hematological effects Not observed 0.53 ppm 8 hr/day (10 m3 per 20 m3 day), 5 days/week 7.4 years average (for the full cohort of 454); 32% of the workers were exposed for more than 10 years 0.19 ppm 0.19 ppm 1 1 1 10 10 0.02 ppm (20 ppb; 0.06 mg/m3; 60 Âµg/m3)
Staff identified Tsai et al. (1983) as the most appropriate study for a chronic REL derivation.
The authors examined hematologic parameters in 303 male workers exposed to benzene for 1-21 years in a refinery from 1952-1978.
Follow-up success was 99.3% in the entire cohort of 359.
A total of approximately 1400 samples for hematological tests and 900 for blood chemistry tests were taken between 1959 and 1979.
Exposures to benzene were determined using personal monitors.
Data consisting of 1394 personal samples indicated that 84% of all benzene samples were less than 1 ppm; the median air concentration of benzene was 0.53 ppm in the work areas A - 11 Benzene
of greatest exposure to benzene ("benzene related areas", for example, production of benzene and cyclohexane and also of cumene).
The average length of employment in the cohort was 7.4 years.
Mortality from all causes and from diseases of the circulatory system was significantly below expected values based on comparable groups of U.S. males.
The authors concluded the presence of a healthy worker effect.
An analysis using an internal comparison group of 823 people, including 10% of the workers who were employed in the same plant in operations not related to benzene, showed relative risks for 0.90 and 1.31 for all causes and cancer at all sites, respectively (p 
Total and differential white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, platelets and clotting times were found to be within normal (between 5% and 95% percentile) limits in this group.
Although the exposure duration averaged only 7.4 years, the study was considered to be chronic since 32% of the workers had been exposed for more than 10 years.
VII.
Data Strengths and Limitations for Development of the REL
Both the animal and human databases for benzene are excellent.
Although the study by Tsai et al. (1983) is a free-standing NOAEL, the endpoint examined is a known sensitive measure of benzene toxicity in humans.
In addition, the LOAEL for the same endpoint in workers reported by Cody et al. (1993) help form a dose-response relationship and also yield an REL which is consistent with that derived from Tsai et al. (1983).
The study by Cody et al. (1993), since it failed to identify a NOAEL and was only for a period of 1 year, contained a greater degree of uncertainty in extrapolation to a chronic community Reference Exposure Level.
The recent results of Collins et al. (1997) that included a NOAEL of 0.55 ppm and of Rothman et al. (1996) that included a LOAEL of 7.6 ppm are consistent with those of Tsai et al.
Therefore the study by Tsai et al. (1983) was used as the basis for the chronic REL for benzene.
In the Cody et al. (1993) study, significant hematological effects, including reduced RBC and WBC counts, were observed in 161 male rubber workers exposed to median peak concentrations (i.e., only the peak concentrations for any given exposure time were reported) of 30-54 ppm or more for a 12-month period during 1948.
The 30 ppm value was considered a 1-year LOAEL for hematological effects.
In this rubber plant, workers who had blood dyscrasias were excluded from working in the high benzene units.
Furthermore, individual workers having more than a 25% decrease in WBC counts from their pre-employment background count were removed from the high benzene units and placed in other units with lower benzene concentrations.
Sensitive individuals therefore could have been excluded from the analysis.
The 30 ppm value is the low end of the range of median values (30-54 ppm) reported by Crump and used in the Kipen et al. (1988) and Cody et al. (1993) studies.
An equivalent continuous exposure of 10.7 ppm can be calculated by assuming that workers inhaled 10 m3 of their total 20 m3 of air per day during their work-shift, and by adjusting for a normal 5 day work week.
Application of uncertainty factors for subchronic exposures, estimation of a NOAEL, and for protection of sensitive subpopulations (10 for each) results in an REL of 0.01 ppm (10 ppb; 30 Âµg/m3).
This is comparable to the REL based on Tsai et al. (1983).
Ward et al. (1996) determined a relationship between occupational exposures to benzene and decreased red and white cell counts.
A modeled dose-response relationship indicated a possibility for hematologic effects at concentrations below 5 ppm.
However, no specific A - 12 Benzene
measures of the actual effects at concentrations below 2 ppm were taken, and the Tsai et al. (1983) data were not considered in their analysis.
The purpose of this study was to characterize the trend for effects at low concentrations of benzene.
A NOAEL or LOAEL was not identified in the study.
The selection of a NOAEL of 0.53 ppm is therefore not inconsistent with the results of the Ward et al. (1996) study.
The human data presented by Tsai and associates were selected over animal studies because the collective human data were considered adequate in terms of sample size, exposure duration, and health effects evaluation.
For comparison with the REL of 20 ppb based on human data, we estimated a REL based on the chronic inhalation study in mice by Baarson et al. (1984), which showed that bone-marrow progenitor cells were markedly suppressed after intermittent exposures (6 hr/day, 5 days/week) to 10 ppm benzene for 6 months.
An extrapolation of this value to an equivalent continuous exposure resulted in a concentration of 1.8 ppm.
Application of an RGDR of 1 for a systemic effect and uncertainty factors of 3 and 10 for inter- and intraspecies variability, and 10 for estimation of a NOAEL from the LOAEL would result in an REL of 6 ppb (20 Âµg/m3).
The Farris et al. (1997) 8 week study indicated a LOAEL of 100 ppm and a NOAEL of 10 ppm for hematological effects.
Application of an RGDR of 1 and UFs of 10 for subchronic, 3 for interspecies and 10 for intraspecies extrapolation (total UF = 300) also resulted in an estimated REL of 6 ppb, in reasonable agreement with the proposed REL of 20 ppb.
One could also crudely approximate an inhalation REL from the oral NTP bioassay where a dose of 25 mg/kgday was associated with hematological effects.
The concentration approximately equivalent to a 25 mg/kg dose for a 70 kg human breathing 20 cubic meters per day is 27 ppm.
Assuming this is a LOAEL and applying an RGDR of 1 for systemic effects, a 3 fold UF for extrapolation to humans, a 10-fold UF for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolation and a 10-fold UF for intraspecies extrapolation yields a REL of 90 ppb.
There are a number of uncertainties to this approach, yet it comes within a factor of 5 of the proposed REL based on human studies.
