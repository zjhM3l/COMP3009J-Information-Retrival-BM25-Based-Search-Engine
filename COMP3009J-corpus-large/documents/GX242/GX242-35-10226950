Millions of pages are added each month filled with all manner of information.
But, if you are visually impaired, the Internet has limited usefulness.
The valuable information contained in charts and graphs can't be understood unless that data is converted from graphics into text form.
We are pleased to be the first company to provide this valuable functionality so that the visually impaired can have the same opportunity to utilize the potential of the Internet."

Corda Technologies Provides Accessibility There are an estimated 800,000 visually impaired persons currently using the Web.
It is projected that there are 6.5 million Americans age 55 or older that experience severe vision loss; by 2030 this number will double.
There is now a law requiring that access be made available to these citizens so that they may use the Internet more effectively.
The implementation date for this law is June 21, 2001.
On August 7, 1998, the President signed into law the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, Public Law 105-220.
Title IV of the Act is the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998.
Subsection 408 (b) amended section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d).
Subsection 508 (a)(1) requires that when Federal departments or agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), they shall ensure that the EIT allows Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other Federal employees.
Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities.

CO R D A PopChart 4.0
Charts and graphs are employed to portray data because they do so in an efficient and concise manner for sighted individuals.
This advantage is lost to those with impaired vision.
The challenge is to make the data dense information contained in charts and graphs accessible to the visually impaired in a usable and informative manner.
PopChart generates and delivers dynamic charts/graphs and descriptive text compliant with the accessibility standards of section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.
Using patented technology, PopChart automatically generates text describing the charts/graphs as they are requested from the database.
The charts and graphs appear "normal" to the sighted user, but also have the generated descriptive text available by clicking on the D -link that can be read using a screen reader.
As the database is updated, the charts/graphs and the text are automatically updated as a function of PopChart.
There is no requirement for additional text input.
508 Compliant
Works with all screen readers
PopChart works with all major screen readers, including JAWS, Window-Eyes, and Home Page Reader.
Platform Independent
PopChart provides a truly dynamic solution.
Once you set up a graph or chart, the descriptive text is automatically generated along with the chart.
Both the chart and the descriptive text are generated from the data in your database.
If your data changes, the chart and the descriptive text automatically change.
You never have to manually create descriptive text and your charts and graphs will always be 508 compliant.
Interactive
Based 100% on Java, PopChart is operating system independent and can run with all major Web application servers.
This greatly simplifies Web developer 's tasks of creating and deploying fast serving, 508 compliant charts and graphs.
PopChart is an HTTP server with a direct API that can generate millions of dynamic, interactive, descriptive charts and graphs.
Corda also offers PopChart Builder, a design tool that enables Web developers to easily build templates used by PopChart to create the interactive descriptive charts.
Support of Industry Standards
PopChart supports industry Internet standards including JAVA and COM interfaces and image generation support of Flash, GIF, PNG, WBMP (wireless), and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)-- the World Wide Web Consortium's standard for vector graphics.
PopChart allows you to use many basic graph types such as pie, bar, line, area, etc.
Corda provides the following services : Â· Custom Development Â· Implementation Â· Training Â· Hosting
PopChart provides interactive descriptive graphs that enable users to drill down to more in-depth information.
Sighted users receive information through pop-up text and drilling down to another chart.
Non-sighted users are able to go from one descriptive link to another, providing the same in-depth information.
