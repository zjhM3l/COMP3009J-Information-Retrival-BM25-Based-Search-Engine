T HE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF NORTH CAROLINA This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Division of Land Resources, North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources, for collecting information all nonfuel minerals.
In 1995, for the fourth year in a row, North Carolina ranked 17th nationally in total nonfuel mineral production value,1 according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The estimated value for 1995 was $742 million, a 5% increase from that of 1994.
This followed a gain of almost 15% from 1993 to 1994 (based on final data).
The State accounted for 2% of the U.S. total nonfuel mineral production value.
The increased values of crushed stone and phosphate rock had the most impact on the changing values of the past 2 years.
The value of crushed stone was up more than 8% in 1995, following an almost 18% gain in 1994.
Phosphate rock value increased 11% in 1995, following an increase of more than 26% in 1994.
Compared with 1994, the other mineral commodity values that increased in 1995 were as follows: feldspar, dimension stone, gemstones, and talc and pyrophyllite.
Decreases occurred in lithium minerals, construction and industrial sand and gravel, common clays, crude mica, and olivine.
In 1994, all TABLE 1 commodities increased in value except for construction sand and gravel, which had a small decrease.
Compared with USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the other 49 States, North Carolina remained first in feldspar and crude mica; first of two States that produced lithium minerals and olivine; third in phosphate rock; fifth in talc and pyrophyllite; and seventh in industrial sand and gravel.
While the State ranked sixth in peat production, it climbed from eighth to sixth in kaolin and dropped from first to fifth in common clays.
North Carolina mines have been producers of industrial minerals exclusively since the early 1970's, particularly since the 1971 closing of the Tungsten Queen Mine, an underground tungsten mine in Vance County.
However, significant exploration for gold has occurred during the past several years.
1 The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products.
