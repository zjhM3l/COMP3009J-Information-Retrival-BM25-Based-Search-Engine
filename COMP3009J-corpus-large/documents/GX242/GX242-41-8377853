SECTION C2 LATTS STRATEGIC AIRPORT SYSTEM Within the Southeastern Transportation Alliance Region, there are approximately 126 airports that currently have scheduled commercial passenger and/or freight operations, and/or chartered services.
There also are proposals to build several major new airport facilities.
The objectives of LATTS did not warrant analyses of all of these facilities because many of them are not relevant to the study's emphasis on trade with Latin America.
Therefore, the airports involved in the LATTS Strategic Airports System were, in large measure, airports which either serve, or have the potential to serve, as a major gateway for Latin American trade.
To ensure equable treatment of each Alliance member, at least one facility in each state was included in the LATTS Strategic Airport System.
The LATTS Steering Committee, working through the LATTS Working Committee representatives, approved a series of criteria to select strategic airports for the LATTS analysis.
The LATTS Strategic Airport System is the result of applying these criteria in a systematic process.
AIRPORTS IDENTIFICATION PROCESS AND CRITERIA The criteria used to identify airports which were included in the LATTS Strategic Airport System were as follows: 1.
Include all airports that currently have non-stop flights to/from Latin America (passenger and/or cargo).
2.
Include all existing airports that have physical features capable of serving long-stage flights by planes with heavy loads (fuel and cargo).
This criterion was further defined to include airports which have a runway with a minimum length of 10,000 feet plus a secondary runway which is at least 80 percent of the primary runway length, plus have adequate open area, cargo handling facilities, is designated as a port of entry with U.S. Customs on-site, have a Foreign Trade Zone associated with it and/or have available land for industrial activities.
3.
Include any proposed airports that the respective state/commonwealth believed (a) would meet the above criteria and (b) was a realistic proposal within the next 10-15 years.
To be considered a realistic proposal, either state legislation should have been introduced which provides project funding or a detailed implementation schedule or equivalent should have been adopted by a state/commonwealth agency.
4.
Include all airports that meet most of the criteria and only marginally fail to meet criteria for one or two others.

LATTS STRATEGIC AIRPORT SYSTEM
5.
Include one airport for any state which does not have an airport that meets the above "major gateway airport criteria."
6.
Include those airports deemed to be of particular interest to each Alliance member (with each Alliance member being entitled to designate up to 5 facilities in whatever combination of transportation mode as the Alliance member felt best served their particular interest).
Data were compiled from a number of sources concerning existing and proposed airports within the Region.
These were the airports which were deemed to be particularly important in their respective state/commonwealth.
However, not all of airports necessarily do or will play a major role regarding trade with Latin America, at least in the foreseeable future.
The large number of airports in the database ensured that any reasonable candidate for inclusion in the LATTS Strategic Airport System would be addressed.
Satisfaction of Criteria Using available information, an assessment was conducted in which each airport was compared with of the adopted criteria.
The criteria used in this assessment focused on physical facilities, intermodal characteristics, and the existence of direct air services to Latin America.
Presented in Exhibit C2-1 is a matrix which contains the results of this assessment.
Fourteen airports currently have direct air service to/from Latin America.
Based upon the adopted criteria, all of these airports were included in the LATTS Strategic Airport System.
Of the Alliance Region airports which do not have direct service to Latin America, 12 have runways of at least 10,000 feet.
The 10,000 feet criterion was considered to be appropriate for study purposes because of aircraft characteristics, fuel and cargo loads, and the long stage lengths associated with flights to/from Latin America.
All 26 of the airports which either had direct service to Latin America or which had a primary runway length of at least 10,000 feet were included in the LATTS Strategic Airport System.
In addition, seven airports were found to have features which nearly met study criteria.
These airports also were included in the Strategic Airport System.
A further 15 airports also were included in recognition of their particular importance to the respective Alliance member.
Two of these airports are proposed two new facilities.
Altogether, the LATTS Strategic Airport System includes 48 airports of which 46 are existing facilities.
