Attorney General header side menu Missing Children Clearinghouse Attorney General Jim Petro Proposes Help for Victims of Identity Theft September 30, 2003 COLUMBUS - Attorney General Jim Petro today announced a proposal to give victims of identity theft a tool to help them regain control of their personal information and also vowed to make identity theft against seniors a more serious crime.
The Identity Passport is a proposed card that the Attorney General's Office would issue to victims of identity theft.
Victims could show the card to creditors, law-enforcement officers and others who question their credit-worthiness or innocence.
"When identity-theft victims are challenged to prove their innocence or explain their poor credit, the Identity Passport will serve as an indicator that they are telling the truth," Petro said.
Petro also said he will push to create a more serious "aggravated identity theft" offense when an ID theft victim is 65 or older.
Such an offense would carry a stiffer penalty than existing laws against identity theft.
Petro is working with the General Assembly to strengthen the law and to create the Identity Passport.
A recent survey by the Federal Trade Commission suggests that nearly 10 million people - nearly 5 percent of the population - were victims of identity theft last year.
That translates to an estimated $50 billion loss for businesses that unknowingly provided goods and services to identity thieves and a $5 billion loss for individual victims.
Those surveyed reported spending an average of 30 hours each trying to clear their records.
Ohioans can protect themselves from identity theft by shredding personal documents before throwing them out, not writing their Social Security and phone numbers on checks, canceling unused credit cards, mailing bills and other personal documents from secure mailboxes and checking bank statements regularly.
The Identity Passport should allow victims of identity theft to avoid the time-consuming process of explaining irregularities in their records every time they are questioned.
Simply displaying the Identity Passport should help prove that they are victims and should be given fair treatment.
In the meantime, victims of identity theft should report the crimes to the fraud divisions of their local police departments.
In addition, they should contact major creditors and inform the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration when the information is used for employment purposes.
They also can call 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338) for more information.
