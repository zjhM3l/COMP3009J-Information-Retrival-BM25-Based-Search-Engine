Strategic Plan for Managing Alien Invasive Vegetation: Colonial National Historical Park Yorktown, Virginia Submitted by: James Ã¯Â¿Â½kerson, Forest Ecologist Virginia Invasive Vegetation Management Team 
The 1916 National Park Service Organic Act gives guidance for land management that is helpful in describing the task of resource protection.
The service thus established shall promote and regulate the use of the Federal areas known as national parks, monuments, and reservations ... by such means and measures as conform to the fundamental purpose of the said parks, monuments, and reservations, which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."
The charge to leave natural and historic resources unimpaired for future generations is a high calling.
It is one made the stronger through a series of federal court decisions and subsequent congressional acts that interpret our "conservation" mission as truly to "preserve and protect."
This implicates non-native invasive species as clear threats to native natural resources and healthy functioning ecosystems.
Further, invasive species are well known for their negative impacts upon cultural landscapes and structures.
Congress authorized Colonial National [Monument] Historical Park, July 3, 1930.
As stated in that legislation: "[It] shall be established and set apart...for the preservation of the historical structures and remains thereon....
[Expenses shall go toward the establishment] and the protection and maintenance of lands and of buildings....The administration, protection, and development...shall be [in accordance]
[From Sections 1, 4 
Protection of the landscape and specific vegetation must be an integral part of such preservation planning and maintenance.
The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) requires Executive agencies and their bureaus to formulate and update strategic plans for program activities.
The National Park Service completed such a document, September 30, 19971.
Several 1 National Park Service Strategic Plan: 1997.
3 mission and long-term goals were established which directly require activities and planning for alien invasive vegetation management.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ NPS Mission Goal Ia: Natural and cultural resources and associated values are protected, restored, and maintained in good condition and managed within their broader ecosystem and cultural context.
NPS Long-term Goals to be Achieved by September 30, 2002: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ia1.
Disturbed Lands / Exotic Species -- 5% of targeted disturbed park lands, as of 1997, are restored, and 5% of priority targeted disturbances are contained.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ia2.
Threatened and Endangered Species -- 25% of the 1997 identified park populations of federally listed threatened and endangered species with critical habitat on park lands or requiring NPS recovery actions have an improved status, and an additional 25% have stable populations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ia7.
Cultural Landscapes -- 50% of the cultural landscapes on the Cultural Landscapes Inventory are in good condition.
Colonial's own GPRA document, the Strategic Plan outlines actions for a five-year period through 2002.
Segments that shed light on alien invasive control and means to accomplish it are included below.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mission Goal 4: The park's natural resources are protected and managed based on adequate scholarly and scientific information and in a manner consistent with applicable policies and regulations, while supporting cultural resource objectives.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Long Term Goal 4.3: By 2002, action has been taken to control invasive, exotic plant species on at least 50 acres of park lands.
[Emphasis added.]
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Long Term Goal 4.2: By 2002, the identified park populations (as of 1997) of federally listed threatened and endangered species with critical habitat on park lands or requiring NPS recovery actions have stable populations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Long Term Goal 4.1: By 2002, current strong partnerships with other federal, state and local agencies and academic institutions [aid I
In summary then, COLO resources shall be proactively protected, restored and maintained within a larger context that addresses ecosystem and cultural needs through the use of federal funding and staffing, as well as other means of individual and corporate partnerships.
Executive Order #13112 on Invasive Species of February 3, 1999, among other things, calls on federal agencies to prevent new invasive introductions, detect, monitor and control current infestations, and educate the public about invasive impacts and control methods.
Federal Agency Duties.
(a) Each Federal agency whose actions may affect the status of invasive species shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, (1) identify such actions; (2) ... (i) prevent the introduction of invasive species; (ii) detect and respond rapidly to and control populations of such species in a cost-effective and 4 environmentally sound manner; (iii) monitor invasive species populations accurately and reliably; (iv) provide for restoration of native species and habitat conditions in ecosystems that have been invaded; (v) conduct research on invasive species and develop technologies to prevent introduction and provide for environmentally sound control of invasive species; and (vi) promote public education on invasive species and the means to address them; and (3) not authorize, fund, or carry out actions that it believes are likely to cause or promote the introduction or spread of invasive species...

Illustrating the hierarchy of law and policy that indicates invasive species management.
Finally, the park's Resource Management Plan describes the need and intent to monitor and treat alien invasives in the context of native species and cultural resource protection.
Notable statements implicating alien invasive management include the following.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Preserve colonial-period resources and make them accessible in a manner that is sage and enjoyable for visitors.
[Emphasis added.]
Protect, enhance and interpret natural resources in a manner consistent with applicable policies and regulations while supporting cultural resource objectives.
[Emphasis added.]
5 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop and implement a comprehensive program to inventory, research, and monitor cultural and natural resources.
Restore, protect and preserve natural watershed(s) conditions and processes, and native plant and animal communities that are characteristics of the Coastal Plain.
Additionally, the RMP includes several project proposals to hire an exotic management team, survey and rank the invasive species found within the park, and begin vegetation management and controls against invasives.
Invasive Plants 
Invasives have biological characteristics that allow them to rapidly invade and out-compete others for moisture, light, and nutrients.
They do this through one or more of the following traits: Ã¯Â¿Â½ High rates of photosynthesis Ã¯Â¿Â½ Able to withstand high microsite temperatures Ã¯Â¿Â½ Prolific reproductive capacity (short maturation to create seed; great seed producers, rapid vegetative spread rates, etc.)
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Rapid early growth and maturity (overshadowing others or expanding roots quickly) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Highly successful seed germination, seed dispersal, and colonization Ã¯Â¿Â½ Long lived seeds or reproductive structures in the soil Ã¯Â¿Â½ Roots or rhizomes with large food reserve (resisting site impacts such as grazing, fire, insects, drought, etc.)
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Production of biological toxins that suppress the growth of other plants Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ability to use other plants, natural features, or structures to overcome natives (shading out other plants) and Ã¯Â¿Â½ Relatively free of natural controls! Implications 
Alien invasives thrive in areas of recent site disturbance.
That is characteristic of pioneer species as they colonize lands opened up due to natural/man-caused events.
Typically, after filling an early niche, native pioneers are later shaded out (or otherwise replaced) by shadetolerant species as the stand develops through time.
Unlike native pioneer species, however, many alien invasives2, once established, are able to create space for themselves by out-competing or overcoming natives.
Thus, many have biological power to capture a position on the landscape from pioneer-to-climax.
That is not natural either here nor in their native ranges.
Typical actions or land disturbances that encourage invasives include: 2 Even those alien invasives that resemble native pioneers, and are phased out by shade-tolerant species, pose environmental risk by taking the place of natives during their land tenure.
6 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Highway or road projects (infested fill dirt, soil exposure, or soil compaction3) Utility projects (soil exposure or compaction) Natural erosion along streams or roads (soil exposure or invasive seed transport) Natural disaster such as windthrow, hail, wildfire, insect/disease epidemics (opening forest stands, harming natives, or transporting invasive seed) Open plowing of fields rather than chisel plowing (soil exposure or subsequent erosion) Pedestrian trampling (soil compaction) Timing of prescribed fire or grazing that disfavors native plant growth or reproduction Herbicide uses that either disfavors natives or opens the site to invaders.
Establishing a Program of Invasive Controls.
Based on the biological and vectoring factors at play, as well as integrated pest management methodologies, the key elements of alien invasive control includes the following.
(1) Identify and rank the pest species.
Since eliminating all non-natives is virtually impossible, the Park must distinguish the most aggressive (invasive) and choose which should be dealt with on a priority basis.
(Typically, non-native invasives cannot be tolerated at even low levels due to their ability to quickly expand and dominate sites.)
(2) Identify natural and cultural areas that need special or early protection due to their significance or sensitivity.
Meld these geographic inputs into the overall priority system.
(3) Identify vectors of potential invasive introductions (as the subsection above) and minimize those potentials.
(4) Set up monitoring plans where site disturbance will or has already taken place for early detection.
(5) Treat prioritized invasives promptly as they appear.
(6) Follow up with monitoring and subsequent treatment (a) to assure eradication or control at the lowest levels possible and (b) learn from practices for increasing effectiveness and efficiency.
Appropriate Field Controls.
Current benchmark, species-specific controls are described in the appendix for the identified invasives to date.
Those descriptions are gathered from such sources as the Virginia Native Plant Society and the Southeastern Exotic Pest Plant Council -- both organizations of high repute.
Several broad categories of action are appropriate when treating alien invasives.
One or a combination of approaches may be involved to effectively match the invasive challenge with effective suppression.
General suppression/eradication approaches include the following.
3 Soil compaction disfavors most species, not allowing root expansion.
Only a hand full of species is well adapted to compacted ground, many of them alien.
7 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mechanical Control -- Involves such treatments as hand pulling or hand cutting of specific plants, or mechanical mowing, harrowing or other treatments of plants en mass.
Prescribed Fire -- Involves the use of ground fire for the purpose of killing or stressing invasive plants, killing seed on the ground, or as a preparation to open better access in areas choked with vines.
Biological Control -- Includes the use of specific and nationally approved insects, diseases or animals to predate upon alien invasive vegetation.
Silvicultural/Agricultural Application -- Includes the use of fast growing native vegetation to capture sites immediately after other suppressive methods have dealt with the primary invasive presence.
Chemical Application -- Involves herbicide or fungicide applications to directly treat individual plants or groups en mass.
Many species when caught in the early stages of infestation may be successfully treated using mechanical methods.
Common mullein (aka flannel mullein) can be treated in this way.
Unfortunately, as invasives expand their presence, the feasibility of handwork diminishes because of the sheer magnitude of the problem.
However, when focusing on specific sites, hand pulling/cutting can still be a valuable tool in combination with other approaches.
Indeed, many invasives are best treated with a combination of approaches.
Reconnaissance Summary Kristen Gounaris, Matt Patterson and James Ã¯Â¿Â½kerson conducted field reconnaissance for this project September 29, 1999, to gain an overall understanding of the alien invasives problem at the Yorktown and parkway units.
Kristen's fieldwork beginning with fiscal year 1999 provides excellent survey information about the invasive species presence and preponderance in specific areas.
Kristen has also provided insight into Jamestown unit through her knowledge of past fieldwork and documentation at the site.
Additional operations-reconnaissance of Jamestown and certain islands should be conducted in the spring to supplement what is known and expand the treatment plan.
The following notes briefly summarize our knowledge and findings to date.
Though many additional aliens are present in the park, the following includes the highly to moderately invasive species.
Bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea).
There are approximately five stands of bamboo within Yorktown and Jamestown.
Though not an extensive problem, where it exists it creates dense stands that shade out other vegetation.
Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon).
This is typically a field and roadside problem within the mown management zone of Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and to some extent Jamestown.
Chinese lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata).
Typically a field and roadside species of Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown, this 2-3' plant creates widening stands that 8 shade out other vegetation.
There is one known patch within an old field (reverting to forest status) which is slowing natural succession.
Chinese privet (Ligustrum spp.).
This shrubby species is present within Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown.
It was a favorite shrub of early settlers and has some level of cultural value.
Chinese wisteria (Wisteria sinensis).
This vine is found in three stands within Yorktown.
It is known elsewhere to shade out other vegetation and strangle tree species.
Common chickweed (Stellaria media).
This low plant is a widespread problem throughout the Park.
It tends to be found adjacent to old home sites, but has also been sited in natural areas.
English ivy (Hedera helix).
This vine is present within Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown.
It is typically found near old and existing home sites.
Several escaped stands are present within forest settings of the Park.
Gill-over-the-ground (Glechoma hederacea).
This low plant is not an extensive problem.
It is found in waste areas, such as adjacent to the Park maintenance yard, and old fields that are returning to forest status.
Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica).
This vine species is all pervasive within Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown.
It is the most widespread of all park invasives.
Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum).
This 4-6' plant is only known to be in a few epicenters of Yorktown.
It is typically a roadside species, but is capable of creating its own monoculture at the expense of other vegetation.
Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum).
This low and rangy grass is a widespread problem in Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown.
Though typically beginning as a meadow species, it is capable of invading shaded natural areas.
Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense).
This 6-8' tall grass is found in many fields of Yorktown and along the Colonial Parkway.
It is especially difficult to eradicate due to its rhizome spreading roots.
Early control is essential.
Kudzu (Pueraria lobata).
Only one patch of this vine is known to exist within Colonial Parkway.
It has a well-earned reputation for overwhelming fields and forests.
Early control is essential.
Oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus).
This vine is not a widespread problem to date.
It is found in two locations: along Colonial Parkway and along a roadside in Yorktown.
Like a scaled down kudzu threat, it should be controlled early on to avoid natural area impacts.
9 Mimosa (Albizia julibrissin).
This tree is found as scattered individuals throughout the roadsides of Yorktown, Colonial Parkway, and to a lesser extent in Jamestown.
It has not created stands to date.
Morning glory (Ipomoea spp.).
This is scattered within the Colonial Parkway and a few stands in Yorktown.
It is not a widespread problem to date.
Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora).
This pernicious rose is found adjacent to old home sites and fields of Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown.
It is known to invade natural areas and roadsides but is not a widespread problem to date.
Periwinkle (Vinca minor 
This low ground cover is found near old home sites and graveyards.
Though perhaps not the most invasive, it nonetheless effectively keeps out natives where it forms dense mats.
It is in a few locations within Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown.
Phragmites or common reed (Phragmites australis).
This Colonial Parkway and Jamestown along watersides and wet extensively throughout the surrounding wetlands as well.
It especially difficult to eradicate due to its rhizome spreading is found in Yorktown, areas.
It has been found is a 6-8' tall grass that is roots.
Princess or empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa).
Though not covering much acreage, this tree is found throughout Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown.
It tends to be shade intolerant and thrives along field edges and roadsides, not entering into forest settings.
Red sorrel (Rumex acetosella).
This low herb was confirmed in one field in Yorktown.
Thorny elaeagnus (Elaeagnus pungens).
This shrubby plant is currently sited only in Yorktown.
Tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima).
Present in Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown, this tree is typically found along forest edge such as forest/roads and forest/fields.
Though it does not create its own openings, but certainly flourishes and expands its range where natural and human-caused openings occur.
Velvet grass (Holcus lanatus).
This low grass is present in Yorktown, Colonial Parkway and Jamestown and has a rather extensive coverage.
It is typically found in fields and old fields.
White poplar (Populus alba).
This tree is found in Yorktown in a few clumps within the forest setting.
Mature individuals are acting as nursing sites for localized regeneration.
White 
This low herb has been sited in one field along the Colonial Parkway.
10 Analysis of Alien Threats Current Infestations.
The current alien invasives at COLO were prioritized using a system outlined in the Handbook for Ranking Exotic Plants for Management and Control by Hiebert and Stubbendieck (1993).
The method assesses each species according to its environmental threat potential and its current control/eradication potential.
The resulting plot of species values on a four-quadrant grid allows easy comparison.
The first priority for treatment are those invasives which have a high environmental threat but which are easily controlled.
The second priority includes high threats but lesser control potentials.
The third have lesser threats and easier control potentials, while the lowest priority has lesser threats coupled with lesser control potentials.
Plotting Alien Invasive Threat 
Ranking invasive vegetation at Colonial National Historical Park.
The ranking of known invasive vegetation is as follows: Priority 1 Kudzu Johnson grass Periwinkle Paulownia 11 Priority 2 Japanese knotweed Bamboo Chinese wisteria Chinese lespedeza Phragmites Tree of heaven Japanese stiltgrass Oriental bittersweet English ivy Chinese privet Bermuda grass Multiflora rose Japanese honeysuckle Priority 3 Mimosa Priority 4 Gill-over-the-ground Table 1.

Though dozens of invasives could potentially infest the park, the following species are known to be in the coast plain/tidewater region and are particularly worrisome due to their environmental impacts.
Both formal and informal monitoring should be done to detect their entry followed by early suppression actions.
Common Name Purple loosestrife Mile-a-minute Latin Name Lythrum salicaria Polygonum perfoliatum Appearance Comments Herbaceous perennial of 4-10' found in wetlands.

See Peterson, p. 302.
Invasive Monitoring A set of field and forest monitoring plots shall be established and remeasured over time to determine current and trending alien invasive species levels.
The focus shall not be to accommodate research, but rather to gather operations information on both infestationspecific and parkwide levels to assist suppression planning.
To accomplish this, the parkwide monitoring effort will focus on (1) forest/field edges, (2) fields, (3) streamsides, and (4) deep forest settings.
Survey/monitoring will be established in each of those stratifications as well as major infestation treatment sites.
Photographic points will be created at each treatment site to supplement the field data.
While annual monitoring is appropriate for treatment sites, the parkwide plots may be on a 5-year cycle unless other factors indicate increased need for remeasurement.
Refer to the appendix for the monitoring protocols.
Program Implementation Once approved, this Plan will guide the approach and implementation of invasive vegetation control in the Park.
The primary responsibility for directing and coordinating the program lies with the Division of Resource Management.
The Virginia Invasive 14 Vegetation Management Team (VIVMT)4 will provide early technical expertise and labor during its period of NRPP support.
However, since the VIVMT program is not permanently funded at this time, COLO will continue the program under available parkbase and grant-based funding using the protocols and the treatment schedule established herein with amendments as appropriate.
Consolidated Treatment Schedule Refer to "Appendix-A Treatment Schedule" for the prioritized listing of intended treatments.
The schedule melds together the zonal and species considerations discussed above.
It is placed in the appendix to facilitate easy updating as work is accomplished and new information is gathered.
New project sites will be added to the list within the guidance of this Plan as added field information is gathered and appropriately evaluated.
Site Restoration As described in the "Appropriate Field Controls" subsection, it may be necessary to plant fast growing native vegetation at control sites to ensure that non-native invasives do not recapture the area.
In general, where affected areas are smaller than Ã¯Â¿Â½-acre, narrow as opposed to exposed, and not involving soil compaction, native plantings are not needed.
Resident or adjacent natives are well able to hold such sites without intervention.
On the other hand, larger sites with impacted soils may well need soil treatments and native plantings to minimize future problems with non-natives.
The need for site restoration subsequent to alien, invasive controls will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine appropriate follow-up treatments.
COLO will fund and execute those plans as needed.
In the end, the goal of alien invasive management is not solely to control non-natives, but it is to create conditions that allow for healthy functioning ecosystems.
With the combination of field monitoring, vegetation management based on priority ranking, site restoration (as needed), and on-going monitoring vigilance, COLO can maintain a landscape that both accurately reflects its historical base and encourages healthy ecosystem functioning.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- The Losing Battle Against Bermuda Grass By Dennis Hinkamp In the Midwest and South, Bermuda grass was thought to be the perfect lawn, it needed little water and because it grew close to the ground it required little cutting.
For most Westerners, though, it is considered an invading weed.
"One of the more common questions I'm asked is how to control Bermuda grass in the lawn.
My standard reply is 'asphalt'," says Jerry Goodspeed, Utah State University Extension horticulturist.
Unfortunately, Bermuda grass can grow through asphalt and really thrive.
"Bermuda grass is a warm season grass planted for lawns in the south.
Warm season grasses thrive in the heat when cool season grasses tend to go dormant or brown out.
These grasses are not recommended for northern areas because they require hot temperatures to look green and attractive.
In our Northern area, warm season grasses look brown and unattractive most of the year, only greening up during the extreme heat in June, July, and August," Goodspeed explains.
On the other hand, he says, cool season grasses such as bluegrass, fescue, and rye look green and lush from March through November.
They relish in our cool climate and are recommended for most lawns in our area.
Bermuda grass out competes all cool season grasses during hot summer weather, but during spring and fall it will sit dormant or grow very little.
One of the obstacles in the war against Bermuda grass is that it reproduces by seed, rhizome and stolons, Goodspeed says.
The seeds are small and can move through watering systems.
The stolons are above-ground stems that creep along the surface looking for new places to root, then start a new batch of plants.
As they creep along the surface they shade and crowd out other grasses, forming a tough dense mat.
It is not a pretty sight.
"The rhizomes are underground stems (that look like roots) that bury themselves up to two feet into the soil.
If broken or chopped they form new plants.
This makes hand pulling almost impossible because pieces left in the soil begin new growth starting the process all over again."
Bermuda grass control requires completely killing the whole plant--roots and all, he says.
This means the plant must be growing and as healthy as possible at the time, which is usually during July and August.
Unfortunately, eliminating Bermuda grass also requires killing the desirable cool season grasses it has invaded.
"No product will selectively remove Bermuda grass out of What does this mean to the homeowner ready to wage war to get warm and the Bermuda grass to get fat, healthy, and about the end of July through early August.
Apply the first Appendix B other grasses," Goodspeed emphasizes.
on Bermuda grass? Wait for the weather sassy, Goodspeed says.
This happens application of a non-selective herbicide 3 such as glyphosate (sold under such names as Round-up, Knockout, or Kleen-up).
This normally kills all the cool season grasses and makes the Bermuda grass good and mad.
Next, water, fertilize, and spend the next two weeks trying to get the Bermuda grass happy and healthy again.
Then, launch a surprise attack on it one morning and apply another dose of glyphosate.
Repeat the process a third time, he says, trying to keep the Bermuda grass healthy and strong.
Then hit it a final time with the herbicide.
This third application will hopefully kill the tough plants that survived the first two applications.
By the end of August or first of September, most of the grass should be dead.
Now is the time to rework the soil and replant the area with an appropriate cool season grass blend.
One slight problem with this "theory" becomes evident when the neighbors do not control their patch of Bermuda grass.
It only takes a year or two before it has moved back into your yard.

Though a bit earthy, it contains valuable information.]
---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- BAMBOO In the proper setting, ornamental bamboo is useful as a specimen plant, screen or windbreak.
Unfortunately, some bamboos SHOULD NEVER be planted this side of Hell!!! But some species of bamboo are aggressive creepers and become a real nuisance when spreading to areas where they are not wanted.
From this uncontrollable, rampant growth pattern comes the common name for bamboo in this area -- Damn-boo.
The aggressive bamboo can indiscriminately emerge through concrete walks, home foundations and even in darkened garages! There is more than one way to control bamboo.
The choice of a method or the combination of methods depends on the circumstances under which it is growing.
A large clump of bamboo looks as though it would be hard to dig out -- but it really is not.
Its many horizontal rootstocks are close to the surface.
All pieces of the shoots and rootstocks should be removed or regrowth will occur.
Cutting bamboo shoots close to the ground, then removing the regrowth each time it reaches 20 to 24 inches in height will eventually kill established plants.
Success with this method depends on exhausting the food reserves stored in the roots.
The prompt removal of the shoots as they reach 20 to 24 inches is essential.
It will have to be performed many times over a period of a year or more.
The length of time required for eradication can be considerably reduced by using the right chemical in the right way.
There are several types from which to choose: --Sprays that kill only the foliage they contact, such as cacodylic acid, should be applied each time the regrowth reaches 20 to 24 inches in height.
These chemicals substitute for the cutting of the shoots; their application must be repeated to starve the root.
-- Sprays that are taken up by the leaves, such as dalapon, MSMA, DSMA and glyphosate, and carried down to kill roots.
Dalapon is available as Dowpon and glyphosate is available as Roundup, Klean-up and Weed-andGrass Killer.
Spray the actively growing leaves to wet and allow a six hour drying period.
Even with these herbicides and mixing a double strength solution, repeated treatments will be necessary to completely eradicate established plants.
To prevent these chemicals from injuring roots of trees and shrubs in the area, irrigate thoroughly before treating.
Then do not irrigate again for 7-10 days.
The bamboo should ONLY be planted in an enclosed, "containable" area from which this devil-plant can escape.
The majority of "problem" bamboo originates from a neighbor's planting.
So BE CAREFUL and BE Appendix B 5 CONSIDERATE when planting bamboo or better yet, NEVER plant BAMBOO! | PLANTanswers Home | Aggie Horticulture | 6 Appendix B [Text taken from the Native Plant Conservation Alliance website, Alien Plant Working Group, dated August 26, 1999.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Exotic Wisterias Chinese Wisteria Wisteria sinensis (Sims) DC.
Japanese Wisteria Wisteria floribunda (Willd.)
DC.
NATIVE RANGE: China and Japan DESCRIPTION: Chinese and Japanese wisteria are exotic, showy, woody ornamental vines in the pea family, or Fabaceae.
These vigorous vines can climb trees, apparently limited only by the height of the tree, and have been observed to reach 65 feet.
Unlike American wisteria (Wisteria frutescens), native to the southeastern U.S., which flowers June through August, and produces a non-hairy seed pod 2-4 inches long, both exotic wisterias flower in the springtime (April-May) and produce a velvety seed pod.
The fuzzy brown seed pods are 4-6 inches long, narrowed toward the base, with constrictions between the seeds.
Stems of the exotic wisterias can grow to 15 inches in diameter in older plants.
White-barked Japanese wisteria vines twine clockwise around the host plant and Chinese wisteria twines counterclockwise.
The compound leaves, consisting of 7-13 (Chinese) or 13-19 (Japanese) smaller leaf units, called leaflets, are about 1 foot long and alternate along the stem.
Fragrant, violet to blue-violet flowers, 1/2 to 1 inch long, occur in showy, pendulous clusters that hang gracefully from the twining stems.
ECOLOGICAL THREAT: Exotic wisterias impair and overtake native shrubs and trees through strangling or shading.
Climbing wisteria vines can kill sizable trees, opening the forest canopy and increasing sunlight to the forest floor, which in turn favors its aggressive growth.
Chinese and Japanese wisterias are hardy and aggressive, capable of forming thickets so dense that little else grows.
DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES: Japanese and Chinese wisteria are found extensively throughout the eastern states.
Click here to see a distribution map.
HABITAT IN THE UNITED STATES: The ideal habitat for exotic wisterias is in full sun, but established vines will persist and reproduce in partial shade.
Vines often climb surrounding vegetation and structures toward sunlight.
W isteria tolerates a variety of soil and moisture regimes but prefers loamy, deep, well drained soils.
Infestations are commonly found along forest edges, roadsides, ditches, and rights-of-way.
BACKGROUND: Chinese wisteria was brought to the U.S. from China in 1816 and Japanese wisteria was introduced from Japan around 1830.
Both were brought in as ornamentals.
They have been grown extensively in the southern U.S. as decorative additions to porches, gazebos, walls, and gardens.
Most infestations in natural areas are a result of escapes from landscape plantings.
METHODS OF REPRODUCTION 
Vegetative reproduction is their primary means of expansion.
Numerous stolons, or above-ground stems, develop roots and shoots at short intervals.
Abundant seeds may also be produced if conditions are favorable, but flower buds are susceptible to winter kill.
In riparian habitats, seeds may be carried downstream in water for great Appendix B 7 distances.
CURRENT MANAGEMENT APPROACHES: The only practical methods currently available for control of exotic wisterias are mechanical and chemical.
Cut climbing or trailing vines as close to the root collar as possible.
This technique, while labor intensive, is feasible for small populations, as a pretreatment for large impenetrable infestations, or for areas where herbicide use is not desirable.
W isteria will continue to resprout after cutting until its root stores are exhausted.
For this reason, cutting should begin early in the growing season and, if possible, sprouts cut every few weeks until autumn.
Cutting will stop the growth of existing vines and prevent seed production.
However, cut vines left coiled around trunks may eventually girdle trees and shrubs as they continue to grow and increase in girth.
For this reason, the vines should be removed entirely or at least cut periodically along their length.
Grubbing, removal of entire plants from the roots up, is appropriate for small initial populations or environmentally sensitive areas where herbicides cannot be used.
Using a pulaski, weed wrench or similar digging tool, remove the entire plant, including all roots and runners.
Juvenile plants can be hand pulled depending on soil conditions and root development.
Any portions of the root system not removed may resprout.
All plant parts (including mature fruit) should be bagged and disposed of in a trash dumpster to prevent reestablishment.
Cut stump treatment, using a systemic herbicide, is effective in areas where vines are established within or around desirable native plants or where they have grown into the canopy.
This treatment is effective as long as the ground is not frozen.
Cut the stem as close to ground level as possible.
Immediately apply a 25% solution of glyphosate (e.g., Roundup) or triclopyr (e.g., Garlon) and water to the cross section of the stem.
Retreatment with a foliar application of glyphosate may be necessary for any sprouts.
Use foliar spray herbicide treatments to control large infestations of exotic wisterias.
It may be necessary to precede foliar applications with stump treatments to reduce the risk of damaging non-target species.
Apply a 2% concentration of glyphosate (e.g. Round Up) or triclopyr (e.g. Garlon) and water, plus a 0.5% non-ionic surfactant to thoroughly wet all foliage.
Chlorpyralid (e.g. Transline) is effective at a concentration of 0.5% and is selective to plants in the aster, buckwheat, and pea families.
Caution should be taken with chlorpyralid as groundwater pollution through leaching can be a problem with certain soil types.
Do not apply spray so heavily that herbicide drips off the leaves.
Glyphosate is a non-selective systemic herbicide that may kill non-target plants that are only partially contacted by spray.
Triclopyr is selective to broadleaved species and is a better choice if native grasses are present.
Ambient air temperature should be above 65[degrees]F for all foliar treatments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Chinese Lespedeza Lespedeza cuneata (Dumont) G. Don NATIVE RANGE: Eastern Asia DESCRIPTION: Chinese lespedeza is a warm season, perennial herb in the pea family, or Fabaceae.
It has an erect growth form, ranging from about 3 to 5Ã¯Â¿Â½ feet in height, and leaves that alternate along the stem.
Each leaf is divided into three smaller leaflets, about Ã¯Â¿Â½ to 1 inch long, which are narrowly oblong and pointed, with awl-shaped spines.
Leaflets are covered with densely flattened hairs, giving a grayish-green or silvery appearance.
Mature stems are somewhat woody and fibrous with sharp, stiff, flattened bristles.
Violet to purple flowers emerge either singly or in clusters of 2-4, from the axils of the upper and median leaves.
ECOLOGICAL THREAT: Chinese lespedeza, sometimes called sericea lespedeza, is primarily a threat to open areas such as meadows, prairies, open woodlands, wetland borders and fields.
Once it gains a foothold, it can crowd out native plants and develop an extensive seed bank in the soil, ensuring its long residence at a site.
Established dense stands of lespedeza suppress native flora and its high tannin content makes it unpalatable to native wildlife as well as livestock.
DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES: Chinese lespedeza is now found throughout the U.S. HABITAT IN THE UNITED STATES: Chinese lespedeza can grow in a variety of habitats including severely eroded sterile soils.
It will invade open woodlands, fields, prairies, borders of ponds and swamps, meadows, and open disturbed ground, but is intolerant of shade.
BACKGROUND: Chinese lespedeza is native to eastern Asia and was first introduced to the southern United States.
W idespread use of lespedeza by federal and state agencies for bank stabilization, soil improvement, wildlife and forage and cover, and hay facilitated its spread throughout the eastern United States.
METHODS OF REPRODUCTION 
The flowers begin to develop in late July and continue through October.
W ithin the Lespedeza genus there are no specialized structures for seed dispersal.
Dispersal is aided by animals consuming the fruits and passing the seeds.
A study on natural populations found that several species of Lespedeza comprise 1.5% to 86.8% of the annual diet of bobwhite quail in the southeastern U.S. Autumn dispersal is aided by the haying of infested fields.
Scarification is necessary for the germination of lespedeza seeds.
Mature seeds of this genus remain viable for up to twenty years; one study found a germination rate of 60% after cold storage for 55 years.
Seedlings may represent only 1% of the seeds actually available in the soil.
Appendix B 11 CURRENT MANAGEMENT APPROACHES: Mechanical and chemical methods are the most effective options currently available for Chinese lespedeza.
Hand pulling is impractical due to lespedeza's extensive perennial root system.
Mowing plants in the flower bud stage for two or three consecutive years may reduce the vigor of lespedeza stands and control further spread.
Plants should be cut as low to the ground as possible and impact to adjacent native plants should be minimized as much as possible.
Since root reserves increase up to the flower bud stage, all herbicide treatments should be completed in early to mid summer.
The addition of a non-ionic surfactant at a concentration of 0.5% improves the effectiveness of foliar treatments.
Triclopyr and clopyralid have been shown to be effective in controlling Chinese lespedeza.
A 2% solution Triclopyr or 0.5% solution of clopyralid thoroughly mixed with water is effective during the vegetative stage prior to branching or during flowering.
Treatments should cover the leaves and stems of plants to the point of runoff.
These herbicides are not labeled for use in wet areas or adjacent to streams.
On wet sites a 2% solution of glyphosate is effective from last June until seed set.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Cogon Grass Imperata cylindrica (L.) Palisot NATIVE RANGE: Southeast Asia, Philippines, China, and Japan DESCRIPTION: Cogon grass is a perennial, rhizomatous grass that grows from 2 to over 4 feet in height.
The leaves are about an inch wide, have a prominent white midrib, and end in a sharp point.
Leaf margins are finely toothed and are embedded with silica crystals.
The upper surface of the leaf blade is hairy near the base; the undersurface is usually hairless.
The flowers are arranged in a silvery, cylindrical, branching structure, or panicle, about 311 inches long and 1Ã¯Â¿Â½ inches wide.
ECOLOGICAL THREAT: Cogon grass can invade and overtake disturbed ecosystems, forming a dense mat of thatch and leaves that makes it nearly impossible for other plants to coexist.
Large infestations of cogon grass can alter the normal fire regime of a fire-driven ecosystem by causing more frequent and intense fires that injure or destroy native plants.
Cogon grass displaces a large variety of native plant species used by native animals (e.g., insects, mammals, and birds) as forage, host plants and shelter.
Some ground-nesting species have also been known to be displaced due to the dense cover that cogon grass creates.
DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES: Cogon grass is distributed throughout the south and southeastern United States as far west as eastern Texas.
There have been reports of cogon grass surviving as far north as Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland.
HABITAT IN THE UNITED STATES: Cogon grass is a hardy species, tolerant of shade, high salinity and drought.
It can be found in virtually any ecosystem, especially those experiencing disturbance.
Cogon grass has been found growing on sand dunes in the southeast, along roadsides, forests, open fields, and up to the edge of standing water.
BACKGROUND: Cogon grass was introduced to the United States both accidentally and intentionally.
Cogon grass was first introduced to the U.S. at Mobile, Alabama, via shipping crates that contained cogon grass as a packing material.
It was also brought in and distributed by the U.S.D.A. for use as a forage grass and for soil erosion control.
Cogon grass is also sold by the nursery trade as an ornamental grass, valued for its attractive foliage and hardiness.
METHODS OF REPRODUCTION 
A single plant can produce several thousand very small seeds that may be carried great distances by the wind.
Vegetative spread of cogon grass is aided its tough and massive rhizomes that may remain dormant for extended periods of time before sprouting.
Rhizomes of cogon grass may be transported to new sites in contaminated fill dirt or by equipment used in infested areas.
CURRENT MANAGEMENT APPROACHES: An integrated approach to cogon grass management, including chemical, mechanical and cultural methods, is necessary to achieve successful, long lasting control.
Effective management of cogon grass has been achieved by the following combined Appendix B 15 mechanical-chemical protocol.
First, the infested area is mowed in late spring to remove last year's growth and the accumulated thatch layer.
About six to eight weeks later, when about eighty percent of the cogon grass has resprouted to a height of 6-12 inches, the site needs to be disced as deeply as possible.
[Discing may not be possible in all areas, due to the sensitive nature of some ecosystems].
When adequate regrowth of the cogon grass has occurred, systemic herbicides (chemicals are carried through the plant tissues to the roots) are applied.
The best time to apply herbicides is in the early fall before first frost.
A 2% solution of glyphosate (e.g., Roundup) is recommended in areas that will be immediately revegetated, because glyphosate has no residual soil activity.
In areas where immediate revegetation is not planned, and non-target plant damage is not a concern, application of a 1-1.5% solution of imazapyr (e.g., Arsenal) may be considered.
IMPORTANT: Because imazapyr is highly active in soil, it has a high potential for leaching into groundwater, so should only be used when groundwater impacts can be eliminated or minimized.
Additionally, nearby trees or other plants may be damaged by improper application of this herbicide.
Revegetation may be necessary following herbicide treatment, to prevent soil erosion and to help reduce reinfestation by cogon grass.
For roadside areas, revegetation with bahia grass and bermuda grass have been used successfully for these purposes.
In natural areas, the choice of which species to use for revegetation becomes more difficult.
For some areas, assisting the process of natural revegetation succession may be the best choice.
Once decisions are made regarding the ultimate goal of the restoration project, revegetation plans should be made accordingly.
Regardless of the goal, the area should be revegetated quickly to allow a stable plant community to be established.
Lastly, it is important to exercise diligence, as it will be necessary to scout areas that have been treated for cogon grass and spot treat new plants with herbicides.
It may not be possible to use all of the methods prescribed above in every situation, but most effective control will be gained by using as many of the steps outlined above as possible.
In areas where burning, mowing, or discing, are not possible, spot treatment with herbicides will help to control cogon grass.
Revisit treated areas frequently and retreat with herbicides as necessary.
The best time to begin a control program is late spring to midsummer when cogon grass is experiencing peak growth.
Some control measures, such as mowing and spot spraying with herbicides, can be implemented year round.
Burning has also been used successfully in controlling cogon grass.
As with mowing, burning stimulates the growth and spread of cogon grass, making followup control a necessity.
If you are interested in attempting this technique, contact management specialists listed below for more specific information.
Also, be sure to obtain all required permits before attempting a burn even on small infestations.
USE PESTICIDES WISELY: ALWAYS READ THE ENTIRE PESTICIDE LABEL CAREFULLY, FOLLOW ALL MIXING AND APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND WEAR ALL RECOMMENDED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE GEAR AND CLOTHING.
CONTACT YOUR STATE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL PESTICIDE USE REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS.

Along roadsides, bahia grass (Paspalum notatum) is a possible choice.
Each scenario will require a different approach to return an area previously infested with cogon grass to a healthy ecosystem.
Specialists in cogon grass management should be contacted for assistance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Common Mullein Verbascum thapsus L. NATIVE RANGE: Europe and Asia DESCRIPTION: Common mullein, also known as wooly mullein, is a erect herb in the figwort family, or Scrophulariaceae.
First year mullein plants are low-growing rosettes of bluish gray-green, feltlike leaves that range from 412 inches in length and 1-5 inches in width.
Mature flowering plants are produced the second year, and grow to 5 to 10 feet in height, including the conspicuous flowering stalk.
The five-petaled yellow flowers are arranged in a leafy spike and bloom a few at a time from June-August.
Leaves alternate along the flowering stalks and are much larger toward the base of the plant.
The tiny seeds are pitted and rough with wavy ridges and deep grooves and can germinate after lying dormant in the soil for several decades.
ECOLOGICAL THREAT: Common mullein threatens natural meadows and forest openings, where it adapts easily to a wide variety of site conditions.
Once established, it grows more vigorously than many native herbs and shrubs, and its growth can overtake a site in fairly short order.
Common mullein is a prolific seeder and its seeds last a very long time in the soil.
An established population of common mullein can be extremely difficult to eradicate.
DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES: Common mullein was first introduced into the U.S. in the mid-1700's, where it was used as a piscicide, or fish poison, in Virginia.
It quickly spread throughout the U.S. and is well established throughout the eastern states.
Records show that it was first described in Michigan in 1839 and on the Pacific coast in 1876, probably due to multiple introductions as a medicinal herb.
HABITAT IN THE UNITED STATES: Common mullein can be found where mean annual precipitation is greater than 3-6 inches and the growing season lasts for a minimum of 140 days.
Intolerant of shade, mullein will grow in almost any open area including natural meadows and forest openings as well as neglected pastures, road cuts, industrial areas.
Common mullein prefers, but is not limited to, dry sandy soils.
BACKGROUND: Common mullein is a monocarpic perennial (i.e., takes two or more years to flower and die).
Brought over from Europe by settlers, it was used as a medicinal herb, as a remedy for coughs and diarrhea and a respiratory stimulant for the lungs when smoked.
A methanol extract from common mullein has been used as an insecticide for mosquito larvae.
METHODS OF REPRODUCTION 
During this vegetative stage, the rosette increases in size during the growing season until low temperatures arrest growth sometime during the autumn and winter.
Beginning the next spring, second year plants bolt into maturity, flower, produce seed during the summer, and then die, completing the plant's normal life cycle.
Flowers mature from the base to the tip of the stalk.
The length of the flowering period is a function of stalk height; longer stalks can continue to Appendix B 19 flower into early October.
It is estimated that a single plant can produce 100,000-180,000 seeds which may remain viable for more than 100 years.
The seeds are dispersed mechanically near the parent plant during the autumn and winter.
Seeds at or near the surface are more likely to germinate.
CURRENT MANAGEMENT APPROACHES: Although common mullein can be very difficult to eradicate, there are a variety of management methods available, depending on the particular situation.
Because mullein seedling emergence is dependent on the presence of bare ground, sowing sites with early successional native grasses or other plants may decrease seed germination and the chance of successful emergence of mullein seedlings.
Mullein plants are easily hand pulled on loose soils due to relatively shallow tap roots.
This is an extremely effective method of reducing populations and seed productivity, especially if plant is pulled before seed set.
If blooms or seed capsules are present, reproductive structures should be removed, bagged, and properly disposed of in a sanitary landfill.
Care should be taken, however, to minimize soil disturbance since loose soil will facilitate mullein seed germination.
There are two insects that have possible biological control implications for mullein.
A European curculionid weevil (Gymnaetron tetrum), determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to be specific to mullein, has been introduced to North America.
The weevil larvae matures in the seed capsules and can destroy up to 50% of the seeds.
Another agent, the mullein moth (Cucullia verbasci) has been tested in the U.S. and is considered to be a relatively safe control agent because of its consistent feeding and development on mullein species.
Although tests showed limited feeding on other native species, the larvae did not survive significantly longer than those individuals tested in the absence of food.
Release of biological controls into natural environments is always experimental and should be entered into only after full and careful consideration of potential non-target species impacts.
Once released into nature, biological control agents are difficult if not impossible to control.
For situations where hand-pulling of plants is not practical or safe, for example, on very steep slopes where hand pulling is dangerous or would cause significant soil disturbance, herbicidal control is an effective option.
Apply a 2% solution of glyphosate (e.g., Roundup) or triclopyr (Garlon) and water plus a non-ionic surfactant, using a tank or backpack sprayer to thoroughly cover all leaves.
Do not apply so heavily that the herbicide drips off the leaf surface.
Use caution as glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide that may kill desirable plants even if partially contacted by spray.
Triclopyr is selective to broadleaf plants and is a better choice if native or other desirable grasses are present.
For some sites, applications can be made during the early spring when most other non-target vegetation is dormant.
Refer to the pesticide manufacturers' label for specific information and restrictions regarding herbicide use.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Japanese Grass or Eulalia Microstegium vimineum (Trin.)
A. Camus.
Microstegium is an annual colonial grass that spreads rapidly into disturbed lowland areas.
Inconspicuous at first, populations may go unnoticed until they have displaced native communities.
It is a C-4 shade tolerant plant that can survive and reproduce under a closed forest canopy.
Height: Microstegium is a decumbent and branched annual grass reaching a height of 60-100 cm (24-39 in).
Stem: Culms are 1.5 m (59 in) long with glabrous nodes and internodes.
Leaves: Cauline leaves are alternate, lanceolate, 10 cm (4 in) long, 2-15 mm (0.08-0.6 in) wide, and sparsely pubescent on both surfaces with ciliate margins.
Flowers: Racemes are terminal and may be solitary or in a set of two or three.
Spikelets are in pairs, one sessile and one pedicellate, and 4.5-5mm (0.17-0.2 in) long.
Blooms August-September.
Seeds: Grain is yellow to red, ellipsoid, 2.8-3.0 mm (0.1-0.12 in) long.
Seeds mature over a period of about two weeks in September-October.
Microstegium is an annual C-4 shade tolerant grass in the Poaceae family.
It is colonial in nature, rooting from the nodes, and may form dense monotypic stands.
Reproduction is exclusively from seed.
Each plant may produce from 100-1,000 seeds that remain viable in the soil for five or more years.
Seed dispersal is primarily by animals, flooding, and deposition with fill dirt.
This plant spreads rapidly into disturbed areas but can invade undisturbed areas by forming satellite populations brought in by animals or flooding.
On fertile mesic sites Japanese grass can replace competing ground vegetation within 3-5 years.
Microstegium is adapted to low light conditions.
At 18% of full sunlight dry matter production is not significantly reduced from production in full sunlight.
It will grow and produce seed in light levels as low as 5% of full sunlight.
Microstegium is native to Japan, Korea, China, Malaysia, and India.
It was first identified in the U.S. at Knoxville, Tennessee in 1919, and in 1933 was collected in western North Carolina.
By 1964, the grass had spread to 35 counties in North Carolina.
By 1972, it had been identified in 14 eastern states, and in 1978, it was collected in Arkansas.
Microstegium can be found throughout the state of Tennessee, primarily in previously disturbed mesic areas.
Microstegium may be confused with cutgrass (Leersia virginica Willd.) or knotweed (Polygonum persicaria L.).
Cutgrass has distinctly longer leaves (1.5 dm [6.0 in]) and shorter spikelets (2.5-3 cm [1.0-1.2 in]
Knotweed is distinguished from microstegium by pale to dark pink calyx and glossy black nutlets.
Alluvial soil found in flood plains and stream sides is ideal habitat for microstegium.
Other typical habitats include damp fields, lawns, mesic woodland edges, roadsides, and ditches.
It is commonly found in areas of natural (e.g., flood scouring) or artificial (e.g., mowing, tilling) disturbance, but can invade undisturbed areas.
Microstegium has been observed growing at an elevation of 1,200 m (3,840 ft), but typically is not found on upland sites.
Deer avoid microstegium, which allows it a competitive advantage in over browsed areas.
Mechanical Control Mow plants as close to the ground as possible using a weedeater or similar grass cutting tool.
Treatments should be made when plants are in flower and before seeds are produced.
Treatments made earlier may result in plants producing new 23 Life History Origin and Distribution Similar Species Habitat Management Recommendations Appendix B seed heads in the axils of lower leaves.
Herbicidal Control Herbicide treatments should be made late in the growing season but, before the plants set seed.
Treatments made earlier in the growing season may allow a second cohort of plants to produce seeds.
Glyphosate: Apply a 2% solution of glyphosate and water plus a 0.5% non-ionic surfactant to thoroughly wet all foliage.
Do not spray to the point of runoff.
Ambient air temperature should be above 65Ã¯Â¿Â½F to ensure translocation of the herbicide to the roots.
Do not apply if rainfall is expected within two hours following application.
Sethoxydin: Apply a 1.5% solution of sethoxydin and water plus a 1% nonphytotoxic vegetable-based oil to all foliage on a spray-to-wet basis.
Do not spray to the point of runoff.
Ambient air temperature should be above 65Ã¯Â¿Â½F.
Do not apply if rainfall is expected within one hour following application.

Exotic Plant Management Manual | Home 24 Appendix B [Taken from the VA-Native Plant Society fact sheet on Japanese honeysuckle found on the web at http://www.state.va.us/~dcr/dnh/invloni.htm] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Japanese Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunberg) Description Japanese Honeysuckle is a trailing or twining woody vine that can grow to more than 30 feet in length.
Young stems are often hairy; older stems are hollow with brownish bark that may peel off in shreds.
The simple, opposite leaves are oval to oblong in shape and range from 1.5 to 3 inches in length.
In much of Virginia, leaves of Japanese honeysuckle are semi-evergreen and may persist on vines yearround.
The extremely fragrant, two-lipped flowers are borne in pairs in the axils of young branches and are produced throughout the summer.
Flowers range from 1 to 2 inches in length and are white with a slight purple or pink tinge when young, changing to white or yellow with age.
The fruit is a many-seeded, black, pulpy berry that matures in early autumn.
Japanese honeysuckle is distinct from our two native honeysuckles, the trumpet honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervirens), and wild honeysuckle (Lonicera dioica).
These natives both bear red to orange-red berries, and their uppermost pair of leaves is joined together.
Habitat Japanese honeysuckle occurs primarily in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, trails, fence rows, abandoned fields and forest edges.
It often invades native plant communities after natural or human induced disturbance such as logging, road building, floods, glaze and windstorms, or pest and disease outbreaks.
Distribution Japanese honeysuckle is native to eastern Asia.
Introduced to cultivation in 1862 on Long Island, Japanese honeysuckle is now widely naturalized in the eastern and central United States.
Japanese honeysuckle was, and in some areas still is, planted as an ornamental ground cover, for erosion control, and for wildlife food and habitat.
In Virginia, Japanese honeysuckle is naturalized state wide, being most abundant in piedmont and coastal plain forests.
Threats Where light levels are optimal, such as in forest edges, canopy gaps or under sparse, open forest, newly established Japanese honeysuckle vines grow and spread rapidly.
Suppressed vines growing in dense shade, however, are capable of rapid growth and spread when light levels in a habitat are increased by disturbance.
In forests, Japanese honeysuckle vines spread both vertically and horizontally by climbing up tree trunks and/or by trailing or clambering over the forest floor and associated vegetation.
Appendix B 25 Trailing vines produce stolons that root when they contact soil, aiding the vegetative spread and persistence of the species.
Dense, strangling growths of Japanese honeysuckle can impact desirable vegetation by decreasing light availability within the habitat, depleting soil moisture and nutrients, or by toppling upright stems through the sheer weight of accumulated vines.
Negative effects of Japanese honeysuckle invasion include development of malformed trunks in trees, suppression of plant growth, inhibition of regeneration in woody and herbaceous plants, and alteration of habitats used by native wildlife.
Control Small populations can be controlled by careful hand-pulling, grubbing with a hoe or a shovel, and removal of trailing vines.
In old fields and roadsides, twice yearly mowing can slow vegetative spread; however, due to vigorous resprouting, stem density may increase.
In pine plantations or in fire-dependent natural communities, Japanese honeysuckle can be controlled by prescribed burning.
Burning can greatly decrease the abundance of Japanese honeysuckle within a habitat and limit its spread for one or two growing seasons.
Where prescribed burning or mowing are difficult or undesirable, Japanese honeysuckle may be treated with a glyphosate herbicide.
Glyphosate is recommended because it is biodegradable and will begin to break down into harmless components on contact with the soil.
However, it is nonselective and can affect all green vegetation.
Therefore, it is best applied to the semi-evergreen leaves with a spray or wick applicator in late autumn when other vegetation is dormant but Japanese honeysuckle is still physiologically active.
Reapplication may be necessary to treat plants missed during the initial treatment.
To be safe and effective, herbicide use requires careful knowledge of the chemicals, appropriate concentrations, and the effective method and timing of their application.
Consult a natural resource specialist for more information on herbicide use and prescribed burning techniques.
Suggested Alternatives Some native alternatives to Japanese honeysuckle for use in home landscaping include trumpet creeper (Campsis radicans), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), and trumpet honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervirens).
Wild ginger (Asarum canadensis) makes an excellent ground cover in shady areas.
All these species are easy to cultivate, have wildlife and aesthetic value, and can generally be obtained from commercial sources or propagated by wild-collected seeds or cuttings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- - Johnson Grass (Sorghum halepense (L.) Persoon) Description Johnson grass forms dense clumps and grows to eight feet tall.
Before the flowers appear, its long, smooth leaves with a white mid-vein are characteristic.
The stems may be pink to rusty red near the base.
Its inflorescence is large and loosely branched.
It produces reddish-brown seeds which are approximately 1/8th of an inch long.
Johnson grass is similar in appearance to eastern grama grass (Tripsacum dactyloides), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans).
Consult an agricultural extension agent or a natural resource specialist if your identification of the plant is in doubt.
Habitat Johnson grass occurs in cultivated and abandoned fields, forest edges, stream banks, roadsides, vacant lots or any disturbed ground.
Distribution This plant is found in virtually every county and city in Virginia.
the United States from its native range around the Mediterranean grass has spread to most warm-temperate regions of the world.
It Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumers Services as a Threats Johnson grass is regarded as a major agricultural weed, especially in corn fields where it forms tall, dense stands.
The dead stems and leaves of this perennial herb cover the ground all winter.
It aggressively crowds out native species, most often along riverbanks.
Along forest edges it can slow the natural succession of fields to woodlands.
Control When cut the underground stems (rhizomes) of Johnson grass resprout forming new plants.
The plant is resistant to many common herbicides as well.
These factors make Johnson grass a pernicious weed.
Small stands may be controlled by hand pulling the plants when the soil is moist.
Severe infestations can be controlled by repeated winter tilling to expose and kill root material.
Spring burning may encourage re growth therefore it is not recommended as a control method for this species.
Appendix B 27 It was introduced to Sea.
In fact, Johnson is listed by the noxious weed.
The application of an herbicide is also an effective control method.
Glyphosate herbicides are recommended because they are biodegradable.
A glyphosate herbicide may be applied to the leaves or freshly cut stems late in the growing season.
Timing is important to insure effectiveness.
Application near the end of the growing season when the plant is transporting nutrients to its roots will result in the highest rate of kill.
Treatments must be repeated over a period of several years to eradicate the seed bank.
Consult a natural resource specialist or an agricultural extension agent for more information on these control methods.

Ohwi) Description Kudzu is a perennial, trailing or climbing vine of the legume family.
Dark green leaves, starchy fibrous roots, and elongated purple flowers with a fragrance reminiscent of grapes readily identify this aggressive vine.
A dense stand of identically colored plants growing on and around everything in its path is also a familiar field mark.
Rarely flowering, kudzu stems and roots spread out in all directions from root crowns, with new plants beginning at stem nodes every one to two feet.
This dense packing of kudzu can result in tens of thousands of plants occupying a single acre of land.
Kudzu leaves are hairy beneath, often tri-lobed, and in groups of three on the vine.
The 1/2 to 3/4 inch purple flowers are pea-like in shape and are produced on plants exposed to direct sunlight.
Kudzu fruits, present in October and November, are hairy, bean-like pods that produce only a few viable seeds in each pod cluster.
It is thought that some seeds can remain dormant for several years before they germinate.
During peak growing season in early summer, this prolific vine can grow at a rate of a foot a day, easily covering and choking trees and understory vegetation.
Habitat A hardy opportunist, kudzu grows in a variety of habitats and environmental conditions but does best on deep, well-drained, loamy soils.
Almost any disturbed area is suitable habitat for this vine.
Roadsides, old fields, vacant lots and abandoned yards are all prime spots for new kudzu growth.
Distribution
A native of Japan, kudzu was brought to the southeastern United States at the turn of the century for use as a soil stabilizer, animal food, and ornamental vine.
Due to its prolific nature and lack of natural insect or disease controls, kudzu quickly became a pest.
In 1970 it was listed as a common weed in the south by the Soil Conservation Service.
Today, kudzu is spread along the Atlantic coast, north to Illinois and Massachusetts, west to Texas and Oklahoma, and south to Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi where the heaviest infestations occur.
It has also recently been found in Florida where it has begun to invade the Everglades.
Throughout Virginia, kudzu stands are a common sight along roadways and bordering agricultural fields.
Threats
Where is grows, kudzu has the ability to out-compete and eliminate native plant species and upset the natural diversity of plant and animal communities
.
Its extremely Appendix B 29 rapid growth rate and habit of growing over objects threatens natural areas by killing native vegetation through crowding and shading.
It can also stifle agricultural and timber production.
In addition, though edible to many grazing animals, its viney nature makes it difficult to cut and bale, making it undesirable as a hay crop.
Repeated defoliation by grazing livestock will eliminate kudzu fields in just a few years, which further reduces its value as fodder.
Control Control of well established kudzu stands can take up to 10 years.
Persistent eradication of all root material is the key to the control of this pest, keeping in mind that a single kudzu patch may extend past landowner boundaries.
The most effective method of control will depend on several factors: size of infested area, proximity to sensitive species or other desirable vegetation, and accessibility of the patch.
Small patches of kudzu that are not well established (usually ones less that ten years old) can be eliminated by persistent weeding, mowing, or grazing during the growing season over a period of three to four years.
Unfortunately, with root systems that can be up to 12 feet deep, eradication by direct root removal is not practical.
Long-term treatment of heavily infested sites usually requires the application of herbicides over a period of up to five years to inhibit the growth of new shoots.
Biodegradable glyphosate herbicides are recommended for control of kudzu in natural areas.
Because glyphosate is a systemic, nonselective herbicide that affects all green vegetation, treatments should be carefully timed and applied by trained applicators.
The best time for application of these herbicides is at the end of the growing season when the plants are actively transporting nutrients from the leaves and stems to root systems.
When applied at the proper time, herbicides are transported to the roots where they kill the entire plant.
In some areas, prescribed burning may be used as a follow-up treatment after herbicide application.
Although it should be carefully and professionally handled, this two step process is effective in clearing out leaf litter and speeding re colonization of an area by desirable native plant species.
Consult with an agricultural extension agent or a natural resource specialist for assistance in designing and implementing a kudzu control program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Mimosa Albizia julibrissin Durazz Albizia julibrissin is commonly known as mimosa, silk tree, or silky acacia.
This hardy tree is a popular ornamental because of its fragrant and showy flowers.
The tree seeds prolifically and resprouts quickly when cut.
It inhabits many of the cutand-fill slopes along roads as well as disturbed areas and stream banks throughout Tennessee Height: Mimosa can reach heights of 6-12 m (20-40 ft).
Sprouts can grow over one meter (3 ft) in a season.
Trunks may be single or multiple stems.
Bark: The thin, light bark is nearly smooth.
Twigs: Moderately slender to stout twigs are somewhat fluted below nodes, and have many light-colored lenticels.
Buds are superimposed and a terminal bud is absent.
Leaves: Feathery, fernlike deciduous leaves are 12.5-20.0 cm (5-8 in) long.
Leaves are bipinnately compound with 10-25 pinnae and 40-60 leaflets per pinnae.
Leaflets are aymmetric, with the midrib near one margin and parallel to it.
Flowers: Showy pink blossoms are 3.8-5.0 cm (1.5-2 in) long and are arranged in paniculate heads at the ends of branches.
They are composed of 15-25 sessile flowers with numerous, conspicous stamen filaments.
Their fragrance is storng and sweet.
Blooms May-August.
Fruit: Flat, light brown, oval seeds are about 1.2 cm (0.5 in) long.
they are borne in flat, linear, straw-colored pods about 15 cm (6 in) long that form large clusters.
The pods ripen August-September and begin to disintegrate soon after, but remain on the trees into winter.
Mimosa seeds have impermeable seed coats that allow them to remain dormant for years.
One study showed 90% viability after five years; another Albizia species had 33% germination of seeds after 50 years in opend storage.
The trees grow rapidly under good conditions but have weak, brittle wood and are short-lived.
They resprout quickly if cut or top-killed.
There are about 50 species of the genus in subtropical and tropical Asia, Africa, and Australia.
Mimosa is native to Asia, from Iran to China and was introduced to the U.S. in 1745.
It is established from Virginia to Louisiana, and in California Mimosa can be confused with other bipinnately compound legumes, especially in the smaller seedlings stages.
Sensitive brier, Shrankia microphylla (Dry. ex Sm.) J.F. Machr., is a weakly arching perennial vine with prickly stems.
Partridge pea, Chamaecrista fasciculata (Michx.)
Green, is a non-woody, evenly pinnate annual herb.
Mimosa takes advantage of disturbed areas, often spreading by seed from ornamentals nearby or from seed brought in on fill dirt.
It prefers full sun and is often seen along roadsides and open vacant lots in urban/suburban areas.
Mimosa can tolerate partial shade but is seldom found in forests with full canopy cover, or at higher elevations (above 900 m or 3,000 ft), where cold-hardiness is a limiting factor.
It can, however, become a serious problem along riparian areas, where it becomes established along scoured shores and its seeds are easily transported in water.
Like many successful exotics, it is capable of growing in a wide range of soil conditions.
Mechanical Controls Cutting: Cut trees at ground level with power or manual saws.
Cutting is most effective when trees have begun to flower to prevent seed production.
Because 31 Life History Origin and Distribution Similar Species Habitat Management Recommendations Appendix B mimosa spreads by suckering, resprouts are common after treatment.
Cutting is an initial control measure and will require either an herbicidal control or repeated cutting for resprouts.
Girdling: Use this method on large trees where the use of herbicides is impractical.
Using a hatchet, make a cut through the bark encircling the base of the tree, approximately 15 cm (6 in) above the ground.
Be sure that the cut goes well into or below the cambium layer.
This method will kill the top of the tree but resprouts are common and may require follow-up treatments for several years until roots are exhausted.
Hand Pulling: Mimosa is effectively controlled by manual removal of young seedlings.
Plants should be pulled as soon as they are large enough to grasp, but before they produce seeds.
Seedlings are best pulled after a rain when the soil is loose.
The entire root must be removed since broken fragments may resprout.
Biological Controls Mimosa Wilt: Fusarium oxysporum f. perniciosum is a fungus that attacks mimosa in the U.S. and is transferred through the soil.
It infects its host through the root system and may be fatal to the tree.
It is not used at present and further research is needed.
Herbicidal Controls Foliar Spray Method: This method should be considered for large thickets of mimosa seedlings where risk to non-target species is minimal.
Air temperature should be above 65Ã¯Â¿Â½F to ensure absorption of herbicides.
Glyphosate: Apply a 2% solution of glyphosate and water plus a 0.5% non-ionic surfactant to thoroughly wet all leaves.
Use a low pressure and coarse spray pattern to reduce spray drift damage to non-target species.
Glyphosate is a non-selective systemic herbicide that may kill non-target partially-sprayed plants.
Triclopyr: Apply a 2% solution of triclopyr and water plus a 0.5% non-ionic surfactant to thoroughly wet all leaves.
Use a low pressure and coarse spray pattern to reduce spray drift damage to non-target species.
Triclopyr is a selective herbicide for broadleaf species.
In areas where desirable grasses are growing under or around mimosa, triclopyr can be used without non-target damage.
Cut Stump Method: This control method should be considered when treating individual trees or where the presence of desirable species preclude foliar application.
Stump treatments can be used as long as the ground is not frozen.
Glyphosate: Horizontally cut stems at or near ground level.
Immediately apply a 50% solution of glyphosate and water to the cut stump, covering the outer 20% of the stump.
Triclopyr: Horizontally cut stems at or near ground level.
Immediately apply a 50% solution of triclopyr and water to the cut stump, covering the outer 20% of the stump.
Basal Bark Method: This method is effective throughout the year as long as the ground is not frozen.
Apply a mixture of 25% triclopyr and 75% horticultural oil to the basal parts of the tree to a height of 30-38 cm (12-15 in) from the ground.
Thorough wetting is necessary for good control; spray until run-off is noticeable at the ground line.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Multiflora Rose (Rosa multiflora Thunberg) Description Multiflora rose is a perennial, thorny shrub of medium height.
Its arching or trailing stems can root at the tip, forming dense thickets.
The compound leaves alternate along the stem; each leaf has 5-11 oval leaflets, the edges of which are toothed.
In late spring, multiflora rose blooms in tapering clusters of white flowers.
As in other rose species, the fruits are small, red hips.
The seeds found in the hips are sought after by many different bird species during winter.
Habitat Usually found in fields, pastures and along roadsides, multifold rose can also appear in dense forest where fallen trees have opened a gap in the forest canopy.
It is adaptable to a wide range of environments but is not found in standing water or in extremely dry habitats.
Distribution Multiflora rose is native to Asia and was brought to the United States from Japan in the 1880's by horticulturists.
Later, wildlife managers planted it for wildlife food and cover.
Its was also used for control of soil erosion and on highway medians to reduce headlight glare.
Multiflora rose is now found throughout most of the United States.
It has established itself in all but a dozen counties of Virginia.
The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has listed this plant as a noxious weed.
Threats Multiflora rose forms dense thickets which can choke out native plant species.
These thickets act as living fences, impenetrable by man or large animals.
Results form studies done on multiflora rose suggest it is highly competitive for soil nutrients and has lowered crop yields on adjacent fields.
Control Lightly infested areas may be cleared with a shovel or grubbing hoe provided the entire root is removed.
Severe infestations of multiflora rose are effectively controlled by mowing or cutting.
This treatment must be repeated 3-6 times a year for 2-4 years.
Applying a glyphosate herbicide directly to freshly cut stumps helps insure kill of the entire root system.
This method is most effective if done late in the growing season.
Foliar application of a glyphosate herbicide will also kill multiflora rose.
Glyphosate Appendix B 35 herbicides are recommended because they are biodegradable.
However, glyphosate is a nonselective, systemic herbicide and will affect all green vegetation with which it comes into contact.
To be safe and effective, herbicide use requires knowledge of the chemicals and their appropriate concentrations as well as understanding of the method and timing of their application.
Consult an agricultural extension agent or a natural resource specialist for more information on these control methods.
In some situations, a prescribed burn during the early growing season may be an appropriate method of control.
As with mechanical control methods, follow-up burn treatments may be necessary for several years to remove plants sprouting from stems or seed.
Seek the advice of a natural resource specialist before implementing this control method.
Suggested Alternative Plants Some native shrubs with attractive flowers and/or fruit production useful to wildlife include Carolina rose (Rosa carolina), high-bush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), black haw (Viburnum prunifolium), and deciduous holly (Ilex decidua).

Authors of this Abstract: Caitlin Bean, Mary J. Russo (Revision) Ã¯Â¿Â½ THE NATURE CONSERVANCY 1815 North Lynn Street, Arlington, Virginia 22209 (703) 841 5300 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- The Nature Conservancy Element Stewardship Abstract For Vinca major I. IDENTIFIERS Common Name: Periwinkle General Description: The following description of Vinca major is adapted from Munz and Keck (1973).
Vinca major, a member of the Dogbane Family (Apocynaceae), is a perennial, evergreen herb with erect flowering stems (0.25-0.5 m long) and trailing non-flowering stems (1 m long), which root at the nodes (Gilkey 1957).
The stems contain a milky latex.
The shiny, dark green leaves are 2-3 cm long, opposite, round-ovate, and pinnately veined.
The entire margins are ciliate with hairs 0.1-0.4 mm long, and there are usually numerous hairs along the midribs on the upper surface (Stearn Global Rank: Appendix B 37 1973).
The blades have a cordate base and are acute to obtuse at the apex.
The almost glabrous petioles are 0.5-2 cm long.
The flowers, which are regular and solitary, are borne in the axil of every other leaf.
The slender pedicels are 3-5 cm long.
The calyx is five-parted with essentially equal lobes of about 1 cm long.
The violet or blue corolla (2.5-3 cm long) is salverform, equally five-parted, and with the tube pubescent within.
The five stamens alternate with the corolla lobes and are inserted at the summit of the corolla tube.
Above the insertion of the stamens is a zone of hairs (Stearn 1973).
The two slender cylindric follicles are somewhat torulous, about 4-5 cm long, and bear 3-5 seeds.
The seeds are without coma.
The features of this species are comparatively larger throughout than those of V. minor, its closest living relative.
Although both species are grown in cultivation, only V. major has established itself as a weed.
The characteristics of V. major that distinguish it from other California species are its milky latex, dark green leaves, and periwinkle-colored flowers.
Since it does not reproduce by seed in California, seedling characteristics are not reported here.
II.
STEWARDSHIP SUMMARY III.
NATURAL HISTORY Habitat: Vinca major is a native from southern Switzerland southward around much of the Mediterranean basin, from Portugal to Turkey, and across much of north Africa (Lawrence 1959).
It has been introduced on many continents as a medicinal herb and subsequently as an ornamental ground cover (Schittler 1973).
It has been cultivated in areas of the U.S. with mild or temperate climates where it has since naturalized.
In California, it is known to occur in 12 counties (McClintock 1985).
Vinca major grows most vigorously in moist soil with only partial sun, "but it will grow in the deepest shade, even in poor soil" (Bailey 1914).
It is liable to cold damage during hard winters (Stearn 1973).
Hot, dry weather will cause Vinca to die back as well.
It is most frequently found as an escape in, "moist rich soils bordering gardens, lawns, roadsides, cemeteries, and shaded waste places, in localities where it has been planted extensively as ground cover" (Muenscher 1955).
Ecology: V. major presumably evolved directly from a V. minor-like ancestor with a doubling of chromosomes.
In V. major 2n=92 and in V. minor 2n=46 (Stearn 1973).
Apparently such polyploidy is frequently associated with rampant vegetative growth and poor reproduction by seed (Salisbury 1961).
Horticulturists interested in Vinca major for ornamental purposes have long been aware that the best means of propagating is by division or by cuttings, as the seeds rarely mature (Bailey 1914).
Reproduction: 38 Appendix B In California, Vinca major does not reproduce by seed in the wild.
Quantitative data on the rate of spread of Vinca are not available from the literature.
It is most often seen spreading from old home sites.
As a result of its shade requirement it often grows in patches around the bases of trees or spreads up and down drainages where the cover is dense.
In ideal growth conditions, Vinca major can spread with great rapidity by means of its arching stolons, which root at the tips (Salisbury 1961).
IV.
CONDITION V. MANAGEMENT/MONITORING Threats: Once established, "it forms a dense carpet to the exclusion of other herbs" (Bailey 1914).
This creates a problem where it is competing in areas with native flora (McClintock 1985).
It appears to be quite stable in the environment; dry or cold weather may temporarily set growth back, but Vinca quickly resprouts and regains lost ground coverage.
Rate of spread is not known from the literature, but usually it spreads only from the point of planting along shady corridors.
Management Requirements: Former preserve managers at TNC's Santa Rosa Plateau and Ring preserves in California indicated that the extent of V. major properties has been increasing.
However, monitoring is still determine rate of spread and to compare management practices implemented.
Mountain on those required to if Detailed observations focused on the vegetational change of the affected area over time will help determine what method of control would be most efficient.
This element does require active management to control and/or eliminate it.
Researched methods of control are listed below.
MECHANICAL CONTROL Muenscher (1955) suggests manual removal of Vinca.
He advocates raising the runners with a rake and mowing them close or digging them out by hand.
CHEMICAL CONTROL Hilgendorf (1952) simply recommends, "spraying with the oil-based esters of 2,4-D and kerosene 1 part in 20."
Matthews (1962), the principal scientific officer of the Department of Agriculture in Wellington, wrote, "On this plant (V. major), 2,3,6 trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) has been more effective than other materials such as 2,4-D and diesel fuel.
(2,3,6-TBA is an amine salt preparation containing 2.4 pounds acid equivalent per gallon.
It is sold under the proprietary name of "Trysben 200.")
The material must be applied in early spring so that it is washed into the soil, as little or no penetration occurs through the leaf.
A rate of 30 lb per acre is recommended.
Fenuron (discontinued; formerly Appendix B 39 manufactured by DuPont) at similar rates is equally effective when applied in the absence of mulch and sufficient moisture."
R. Schonholz, an environmental consultant for Larry Seeman and Associates, Berkeley, CA, explained that environmentally benign herbicides are not effective on Vinca due to the waxy cuticle of the leaves that make chemical penetration difficult.
Even the makers of Roundup, an herbicide that biodegrades within a week, advise against its use on Vinca.
However, Tom Griggs, Preserve Manager at TNC's Cosumnes River Preserve in California, and Geoffrey Babb, former manager of two TNC preserves in Arizona, have had some success in eradicating Vinca by using Roundup (see MGMT-PROGRAMS below).
The most caustic chemicals, including paraquat (made by Chevron) and "Goal," which contains the active ingredient oxyflurfen, may be considered strong enough to eradicate Vinca due to their persistence.
Monterey County farm advisor Harry Agamalen suggested trying a soil fumigant on affected areas.
He recommended clearing the surface growth, laying down a plastic tarp, and fumigating with carbon disulfide, an organic fumigant.
Much of the information available on Vinca major was on how to suppress the weeds that could establish amongst its web-like growth, for in many areas it is still propagated for distribution to nurseries.
In one such article, "Effect of trifluralin and melordogyne-hapler chitwood on growth of Vinca major L." (Fuchigami and MacDonald 1968), it was discovered that soil applications of one or more pounds per acre of trifluralin severely stunted plant growth and caused galls to be produced on the root tips that were macroscopically similar to those produced by the northern rootknot nematodes.
Similar difficulties were encountered by Minnesota growers.
BIOLOGICAL CONTROL No biological controls are known.
At present, methods suggested for controlling the spread and/or eradication of V. major are scanty.
Mechanical means for control include raising the runners and mowing or complete removal by hand.
Herbicides proven successful on V. major are 2,4-D, 2,3,6-TBA, and Fenuron, among others.
Control programs are currently underway at TNC's Santa Rosa Plateau and Ring Mountain preserves, California, and Mile-Hi/Ramsey Canyon Preserve, Arizona.
VI. RESEARCH Management Research Programs: Tom Griggs, Preserve Manager at TNC's Cosumnes River Preserve, has experimented with herbicide methods of control on Vinca around the perimeters of a few buildings at TNC's Santa Rosa Plateau Preserve.
In January 1985 he applied a 1% solution of Roundup to the infested area.
At the time, Vinca had new growth approximately 5 cm in length.
However, most of the plants' biomass had been produced during the past growing season.
After two weeks, the Vinca appeared to have stopped growing and all associated grasses were turning yellow.
Two months after this 40 Appendix B treatment, 80% of what was sprayed was dying or dead.
The new growth had stopped growing, yellowed and then dropped from the stem.
In some areas within the treated acreage, new growth continued, attaining a height of one foot in two months.
This was attributed to incomplete spray coverage.
Untreated growth of Vinca in the area had also produced one foot of new growth by March 1985.
Griggs (1985) planned to apply Roundup solution on actively growing Vinca again in the near future.
Greg Wolley, former Preserve Manager at TNC's Ring Mountain Preserve, CA, planned to treat V. major in 1985 by applying a 2% solution of Roundup at the beginning of a 7-day forecast of dry weather.
Geoffrey Babb has conducted spray tests of Roundup to eradicate Vinca at TNC's Mile-Hi/Ramsey Canyon Preserve in Arizona.
He tested nine eradication regimes.
Three groups were simply sprayed with Roundup but in various concentrations: 3%, 4%, or 5% solutions.
Another three groups were first cut with a scythe and then sprayed with the three different concentrations of Roundup.
The last three groups were sprayed in the same way but afterwards covered with clear plastic.
The greatest success occurred in the groups that were first cut, then sprayed.
Wounding the plant appears to allow sufficient absorption of the herbicide, which is usually prevented by Vinca's thick waxy cuticle.
Although Babb had the greatest eradication success (nearly 100%) using the cut/spray method with a 5% solution of Roundup, he recommends cutting then spraying with a 3% solution (which resulted in a 70-75% success rate in his tests), and then spot treating where necessary.
Treatment should be done after a rain in early or late spring when soil moisture and air temperatures (at least 70 F, preferably 80 F) are best for active plant growth.
Continued warm, moist conditions, as with the monsoon season, encourage active growth, quickly translocating the herbicide, helping to kill the plant.
Uniform medium to heavy spraying should be done within 5-10 minutes of cutting.
The initial spraying is most efficiently done using a back-pack sprayer, with Wickwiper applicators working well for spot treatments and those near a creek.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Privet Ligustrum spp. L. Several species of privet have been widely planted in Tennessee, primarily as a hedge in landscaping.
They are difficult to distinguish and include common privet (L. vulgare L.), Chinese privet (L. sinense Lour.), and Japanese privet (L. japonicum Thunb.).
All belong to the Oleaceae (Olive) family and easily escape cultivation to invade adjacent areas and form dense monocultural thickets.
Height: Privet can grow up to 5 m (16 ft) tall and to a diameter of 2.5-25 cm (110 in).
Bark: Privet bark is whitish-tan to gray in color and smooth in texture.
Young branches are minutely hairy.
Twigs: Slender twigs are straight, rounded or four-angled below the nodes, and gray-green in color.
Terminal buds are present.
Leaves: These deciduous or half-evergreen plants hold foliage into winter, but drop it before spring.
Leaves are elliptic to ovate in shape.
They are oppositely arranged on slender twigs and have 4-5 pairs of indistinct veins.
Privet leaves are less than 6 cm (2.5 in) long, glabrous, leathery and thick, with a glossy cuticle on upper surface.
Flowers: The perfect flowers are small and white.
Bloom time is June-July.
Fruit: The black, berrylike fruits contain 1-4 seeds and are borne in terminal clusters.
Fruits are subglobose or ovoid and are 6-8 mm (0.25 in) long.
The fruit clusters ripen during September and October and persist through the winter.
Mature specimens can produce hundreds of fruit.
Privet is a perennial shrub that readily grows from seed or from root and stump sprouts.
Privet escapes cultivation by movement of seed, which is eaten and subsequently transported by wildlife, particularly birds.
The seeds are reported to have a low germination rate: 5%-27% in two tests.
The privets are native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia.
This ornamental landscape plant has been cultivated since ancient times and has been developed into several horticultural varieties.
Date of introduction to the United States is unknown as is any record of introduction to Tennessee.
Current range maps show L. vulgare (L.) in four central and six eastern Tennessee counties and L. sinense (Lour.) in three central and two eastern Tennessee counties; however both species are suspected to have wider distributions.
The leaves of the native shrub coralberry, Symphoricarpos orbiculatus (Moench.), are similar in shape to common privet.
Coralberry is distinguished by its very slender twigs, deciduous leaves, red berries borne in axillary clusters, and the lack of a terminal bud.
Privet is often seen along roadsides and other areas of disturbed soil at elevations less than 915 m (3000 ft).
Privet also becomes established in old fields and landscapes that have abundant sunlight.
Blunt-leaved privet, L. obtusifolium (Sieb. and Zucc.), was found invading an old field succession site in Illinois.
The field had an average of more than 6,082 plants per ha (2.5 acres).
Privet can also spread into forests, though it does not produce fruit in low light.
Mechanical Controls Mowing/Cutting: This method is appropriate for small initial populations or environmentally sensitive areas where herbicides cannot be used.
Repeated mowing or cutting will control the spread of privet, but will not eradicate it.
Stems should be cut at least once per growing season as close to ground level as 43 Life History Origin and Distribution Similar Species Habitat Management Recommendations Appendix B possible.
Hand Pulling: Privet is effectively controlled by manual removal of young seedlings.
Plants should be pulled as soon as they are large enough to grasp but before they produce seeds.
Seedlings are best pulled after a rain when the soil is loose.
Larger stems, up to 6 cm (2.5 in), can be removed using a Weed Wrench or similar uprooting tools.
The entire root must be removed since broken fragments may resprout.
Biological Controls Privet has no known biological controls.
A foliage-feeding insect native to Europe, Macrophya punctumalbum, is a known pest.
Privet is also susceptible to a fungal leaf spot, Pseudocercospora ligustri, and a common root crown bacteria, Agrobacterium tume-faciens.
Herbicidal Controls Foliar Spray Method: This method should be considered for large thickets of privet where risk to non-target species is minimal.
Air temperature should be above 65Ã¯Â¿Â½F to ensure absorption of herbicides.
The ideal time to treat is in late fall or early spring when many native species are dormant.
Glyphosate: Apply a 2% solution of glyphosate and water plus a 0.5% non-ionic surfactant to thoroughly wet all leaves.
Use a low pressure and coarse spray pattern to reduce spraydrift damage to non-target species.
Glyphosate is a nonselective systemic herbicide that may kill non-target partially-sprayed plants.
Triclopyr: Apply a 2% solution of triclopyr and water plus a 0.5% non-ionic surfactant, to thoroughly wet all leaves.
Use a low pressure and coarse spray pattern to reduce spray-drift damage to non-target species.
Triclopyr is a selective herbicide for broadleaf species.
In areas where desirable grasses are growing under or around privet triclopyr can be used without non-target damage.
Cut Stump Method: This control method should be considered when treating individual bushes or where the presence of desirable species preclude foliar application.
This treatment is effective as long as the ground is not frozen.
Glyphosate: Horizontally cut privet stems at or near ground level.
Immediately apply a 25% solution of glyphosate and water to the cut stump making sure to cover the entire surface.
Triclopyr: Horizontally cut privet stems at or near ground level.
Immediately apply a 25% solution of triclopyr and water to the cut stump making sure the entire surface is covered.
Basal Bark Method: This method is effective throughout the year as long as the ground is not frozen.
Apply a mixture of 25% triclopyr and 75% horticultural oil to the basal parts of the shrub to a height of 30-38 cm (12-15 in) from the ground.
Thorough wetting is necessary for good control; spray until run-off is noticeable at the ground line.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- Tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Miller) Swingle) Description Tree-of-heaven is a small to medium-sized tree in the mostly tropical Quassia family.
It has smooth gray bark.
Leaves are compound, alternate, odd-pinnate, with 11-25 lanceolate leaflets.
Most leaflets have one to three coarse teeth near their base.
Tree-of-heaven leaves may be confused with those of sumac or black walnut.
Flowers occur in panicles at the ends of branches; male flowers produce a strong odor which has been described as "the smell of burnt peanut butter."
The leaves when crushed also produce this distinctive, offensive odor.
Seeds are centered in a papery sheath called a samara.
The samaras are slightly twisted or curled, and twirl as they fall to the ground.
They can be borne on the wind great distances from the parent plant.
Ailanthus altissima stump with multiple resprouts Habitat Tree-of-heaven establishes itself readily on disturbed sites.
These include vacant lots of the inner city, railroad embankments, highway medians, fence rows and roadsides.
In naturally forested areas, disturbance created by severe storms or insect infestations can open the way for tree-of-heaven infestation.
Distribution Tree-of-heaven is native to a region extending from China south to Australia.
It was imported into the United States in 1784 by a Philadelphian gardener.
In the western states it was brought over by Chinese immigrants who use it for medicinal purposes.
Due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production, it quickly escaped from cultivation.
Threats One tree-of-heaven can produce up to 350,000 seeds in a year.
Seedlings establish a taproot three months from germination.
Thus, they quickly outrace many native plant species in competition for sunlight and space.
Tree-of-heaven also produces a toxin in its bark and leaves.
As these accumulate in the soil, the toxin inhibits the growth of other plants.
This toxin is so effective it is currently being studied as a possible source for a natural herbicide.
These factors combine to make tree-of-heaven a very aggressive invasive plant able to displace native tree and herb species.
Furthermore, the root system is capable of doing damage to sewers and foundations.
Appendix B 47 Control Tree-of-heaven is very difficult to remove once it has established a taproot.
It has persisted in certain areas despite cutting, burning and herbiciding.
Therefore, seedlings should be removed by hand as early as possible, preferably when the soil is moist to insure removal of the entire taproot.
Larger plants should be cut; two cuttings a year may be necessary, once in the early growing season and once in the late growing season.
Initially, this will not kill the plant; it will vigorously resprout from the roots, but seed production will be prevented and the plants will be lowered in stature.
If continued over a period of several years, cutting during the growing season stresses the plants and may eventually kill them.
A glyphosate herbicide, either sprayed onto the leaves or painted onto a freshly cut stump will kill the plant.
However, to insure the herbicide gets into the root system, it is best to apply this herbicide in the late growing season while the plant is translocating nutrients to its roots.
Glyphosate herbicides are recommended because they are biodegradable, breaking down into harmless components on contact with the soil.
However, glyphosate is nonselective, systemic and will affect all green vegetation.
To be safe and effective, herbicide use requires careful knowledge of the chemicals, appropriate concentrations, and the effective method and timing of their application.
Consult a natural resource specialist or agricultural extension agent for more information before attempting herbicide control of tree-of-heaven.

Portions of treatment areas are adjacent to neighboring properties; the park may chose to cooperate with those landowners to jointly address invasive species.
However, treatments without a larger context are appropriate and will not impact those lands.
Ron Stouffer, Engineer with the Northern Virginia Field Office, U.S. Corps of Engineers, advised us by phone on February 9, 2000, that wetland/streamside invasive vegetation treatments without excavation do not need permits from that agency.

Describe the category used to exclude action from further NEPA analysis and indicate the number of the category (see Section 3-4 of NPS-12): Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Restoration of non-controversial native species into suitable habitats within their historic range, and elimination of exotic species (516 DM2 App. 7.4 E(6)).
Stabilization by planting native plant species in disturbed areas (516 DM2 App. 7.4 E(4)).
Non-destructive data collection, inventory, study, research, and monitoring activities (516 DM2 App. 2, 1.6).
Day-to-day resource management and research activities (516 DM2 App. 7.4 E(2)).
Describe any public or agency involvement effort conducted (reference the attached ESF): This is a cooperative effort of national parks within the Virginia Subcluster, ChesapeakeAllegheny Cluster, Northeast Region.
Technical expertise has been drawn upon from Shenandoah National Park, the Philadelphia Support Office, and several regional exotic pest plant councils.
On the basis of the environmental impact information in the statutory compliance file, with which I am familiar, I am categorically excluding the described project from further NEPA analysis.
No exceptional circumstances (e.g., all boxes in the ESF are marked "No") or conditions in section 3-6 apply, and the action is fully described in section 3-4 of NPS-12.
