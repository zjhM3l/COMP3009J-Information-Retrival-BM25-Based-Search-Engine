Abstract Farmworkers frequently encounter toxic substances as part of their jobs.
Training is essential for preventing exposure and avoiding health problems associated with pesticides.
Federal Worker Protection Standards (WPS) establish standards for protecting farmworkers from exposure to pesticides, emergency aid procedures, and training for wokers who enter areas treated with pesticides.
Employers are responsible for ensuring that training and information is provided in language that is understandable to workers.
This cartoon book follows the experiences of Cati, a new farmworker, as she begins her new job and learns about safety precautions and the potential for accidents when working with pesticides.
The book is intended to be used as a supplement to WPS-required farmworker training.

COEP University of California, Davis Subjects Household products, Accident prevention, Safety measures, Migrant farmworkers Abstract California's farmworkers come from a variety of ethnic and educational backgrounds, yet safety messages concerning most chemical products (including agricultural and household chemicals) are conveyed in writing, and often in English.
This pilot study examined safety literacy, specifically if and how migrant families seek and use safety information provided on the labels of three common household chemical products.
Thirty migrant farmworkers, predominantly Spanish-speaking, were interviewed using a questionnaire.
The majority of participants use these household products yet did not or could not read the product labels for safety information.
Few participants were aware of the proper steps to take in the event of a medical emergency involving the product.
These results indicate an important safety information gap.

Abstract The "ag/urban" frontier is represented by gentrified inner cities and urban ghettos located in geographic proximity to agricultural areas, a phenomenon that is common in northern California as well as many other places in the United States and abroad.
The Center for Environmental Health Sciences at University of California at Davis convened a town hall meeting to discuss local environmental health issues related to this phenomenon, including concerns about air and water quality, land use and agricultural practices, and environmental management.
These minutes cover selected parts of the discussion: 1) an introduction by Dr. Richard Vulliet; 2) comments from Dr. Kenneth Olden, NIEHS Director, about "breakthrough environmental health issues at the national level," as well as the role of town meetings in setting research priorities; 3) comments from California State Senator Byron Sher about "creating policy for the ag/urban interface" and legal methods for dealing with conflicts between farmers and neighboring non-farming communities and for preservation of farm land; and 4) a panel discussion including all speakers, with questions from the audience.

Abstract Within the United States, asthma morbidity and mortality has increased disproportionately among poor, minority children living in the inner city.
Poverty, ethnicity, and residence in the inner city are closely related in the United States, and considerable effort has been directed at dissecting these factors.
There seems to be definite racial differences in prevalence that cannot be accounted for by socioeconomic status.
From National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II data the rate of asthma among children aged 6 months to 11 years was 3.0% in whites and 7.2% in AfricanAmericans.
Although the rate of asthma was related to age, gender, and residence in the inner city, even when adjusted for these factors, the ethnic differences were significant.
Similarly, in the Six Cities Study the unadjusted prevalence in whites 7 to 14 years was 4.8% and in blacks was 6.7%, and the differences were statistically significant after adjustment for confounding variables.
Hispanic children also have a higher prevalence of asthma.
Morbidity from asthma is also higher in minorities, but poverty seems to largely explain these differences.
Mortality from asthma is as much as three times higher in minorities, and the relation of mortality to black and Hispanic ethnicity has been found by some but not all investigators to be explained by poverty.
Taken together, these studies suggest that the three components of ethnicity, poverty, and residence cannot be dissected easily, and should be viewed together when trying to understand risk factors for asthma.A number of factors have been proposed as responsible for the increased prevalence and severity of asthma among inner city children.
These include large categories: access to medical care, patterns of medical care, psychosocial stress, and environmental exposures.

Abstract While indoor air quality is a concern in schools because of the potential aggravation of children's asthma and allergies, standard methods for measuring indoor air pollutant concentrations (stationary air samplers) may not accurately reflect children's exposure.
This pilot study collected baseline data on indoor air pollutant concentration in an elementary school and compared measurements by two methods: stationary air samplers located in various parts of the building and personal monitors worn by students.
During two-day sampling periods, fifth-grade students who had been trained in indoor air issues, lung physiology, and the science of sampling kept time-activity diaries while carrying backpacks that contained two personal air samplers, one for particulates and one for volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Stationary air samplers collected samples concurrently.
Investigators also collected and tested carpet dust samples for common allergens.
Results show that VOC concentrations in the school were low and that particulate concentrations were generally higher in personal samples than in area samples.
The latter phenomenon has been found in previous exposure studies.
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using student monitors in air quality studies, clarifies the relationship between area sampling and personal exposure to air pollutants, and establishes a baseline level of pollutant exposure for a school with a strong commitment to clean air.

http://www.aicr.org/form1.htm Johns Hopkins University Diet, Nutrition, Cancer prevention, Life style, Fruits, Vegetables, Nutrition education While cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, 60 to 70 percent of cancers are preventable.
Healthy changes in diet could have a dramatic effect on cancer incidence and mortality.
This booklet summarizes the recommendations of the American Institute for Cancer Research resulting from studies that supported the development of its 1997 report on global cancer prevention.
The 15 specific recommendations encourage a greater reliance on plant-based foods; eating more fruits and vegetables; minimizing consumption of alcohol, fat, and salt; maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active; and avoiding tobacco.

Abstract Through the media and elsewhere, students encounter many issues related to the effects of environmental chemicals and pollutants on their health.
This classroom program helps students develop the scientific and health literacy required to evaluate information and make educated decisions about such issues.
The program analyzes environmental health and water pollution problems through the voices of a group of high school students.
It contains four sections: a drama and three "documentaries."
The drama concerns a cholera outbreak in a small coastal town.
A group of concerned students works with the local health department to collect and evaluate evidence to determine the cause of the outbreak.
The three documentaries, each led by one of the students from the drama, address different water-related environmental issues, including waterborne illness, water purification, the hydrologic cycle, and mercury poisoning.
The supplemental Teacher's Guide provides a synopsis of each of the four sections of the video, as well as related activities, experiments, and discussion questions.
It also contains instructions for a critical thinking activity that builds on the concepts and skills learned throughout the program.
