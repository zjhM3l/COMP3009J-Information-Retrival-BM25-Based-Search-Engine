Cases 31Â­CAÂ­18378, 31Â­ CAÂ­18468, 31Â­CAÂ­18526, 31Â­CAÂ­18582, 31Â­ CAÂ­18602, 31Â­CAÂ­18701, 31Â­CAÂ­18802, 31Â­ CAÂ­18939, 31Â­CAÂ­19113, 31Â­CAÂ­19152, and 31Â­CAÂ­19195 December 16, 1992 DECISION AND ORDER BY CHAIRMAN STEPHENS AND M DEVANEY AND OVIATT EMBERS
On September 14, 1992, following issuance of the consolidated complaint but prior to the scheduled unfair labor practice hearing in the above cases, the Respondent and the General Counsel entered into a formal settlement stipulation, subject to the Board's approval, providing for the entry of a consent order by the Board and a consent judgment by any appropriate United States court of appeals.
The parties to the settlement waived all further and other proceedings before the Board to which they may be entitled under the National Labor Relations Act and the Board's Rules and Regulations, and Respondent waived all defenses to the entry of judgment or to receive further notice of the application therefor.
Thereafter, on September 29, 1992, the Charging Party Union filed a statement in support of objections to stipulation with the Board.
The Union's statement incorporated the objections the Union had previously made to the Regional Director and the General Counsel regarding the settlement stipulation, and raised an additional reason one of its prior objections to the settlement should be sustained.
In essence, the Union's objections to the settlement are as follows: (1) The stipulated order fails to contain broad ceaseand-desist language.
The Union asserts that such language is warranted given the pervasiveness of Respondent's violations.
(2) The order provides for only the ``minimal'' 60day posting period.
Given the number of the Respondent's violations (52 over a 2-year period), the Union asserts that a 1-year posting period as in J. P. Stevens 
(3) The settlement contains a nonadmission clause.
(4) The settlement's reservations clause fails to clearly preserve the General Counsel's right to proceed on all other pending unfair labor practice charges not specifically covered by the settlement.
(5) The settlement fails to include a provision dismissing the decertification petition that was filed on October 12, 1990 (Case 31Â­RDÂ­1218).
The Union asserts that the petition was clearly tainted by the Respondent's actions; that unlike in Nu-Aimco, Inc., 306 NLRB 978 (1992), the case cited by the Regional Director, there is evidence in the instant case that Re309 NLRB No. 136
spondent assisted in the initiation of the petition and the gathering of signatures; that the Union filed a charge in April 1991 alleging such Employer involvement; and that, although the Regional Director subsequently dismissed the charge, he did so not on its merits, but because the charge was barred by the 10(b) limitations period.
The Union asserts that evidence of Respondent's involvement is contained in the Region's files.
Finally, the Union requests, and contends that it has a right to, an evidentiary hearing on its objections to the settlement, citing Food 
For the reasons set forth below, we overrule the Union's objections to the settlement, deny its request for an evidentiary hearing on its objections, and approve the settlement.
No broad cease-and-desist language.
The stipulated order does contain broad cease-and-desist language.
Whether this was added after the Union's initial objection to the Regional Director or the General Counsel is unclear; but in any event such language clearly is included in the executed settlement that was forwarded to the Board for approval, and has therefore also been included in the consent order set forth below.
See paragraph 1(aa).
No extraordinary 1-year posting period.
The 60-day posting period provided in the settlement is the traditional posting period required by the Board.
Further, the J. P. Stevens case is distinguishable.
Although the two cases are similar in that both involve numerous alleged 8(a)(1) and (5) violations over a several-year period, unlike here, there were also a number of 8(a)(3) violations in J. P. Stevens.
In any event, even assuming arguendo that J. P. Stevens is not distinguishable on that basis, this is a settlement rather than a final adjudication on the merits as in J. P. Stevens.
Thus, although J. P. Stevens may be relevant, it is not controlling.
Inclusion of nonadmission clause.
As indicated in the General Counsel's letter to the Union, inclusion of a nonadmission clause is not inappropriate where, as here, the settlement provides for a consent court judgment.
Further, the Board in the past has consistently approved formal settlements containing such a clause where the settlement would otherwise effectuate the policies of the Act.
Ambiguous reservations clause.
The settlement's reservations clause states as follows: This stipulation is intended to settle cases set forth in paragraph 1 above only, and does not affect any pending cases, or cases hereafter filed, including Cases 31Â­CAÂ­19385, 31Â­CAÂ­19407, and 31Â­CAÂ­19409.
Further, it is understood that the General Counsel reserves the right to use any

DECISIONS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
evidence developed during the investigation and prosecution of the cases set forth in paragraph 1 for any relevant purpose in subsequent proceedings.
As indicated in the General Counsel's letter, the foregoing provision clearly indicates that any pending ULP charges not set forth in paragraph 1 of the settlement are preserved for litigation.
Although it is true that the first sentence only specifically cites three cases, the sentence as a whole clearly indicates that all other cases are also preserved.
There is no ambiguity.
No provision dismissing decertification petition.
As indicated in the General Counsel's letter, the General Counsel determined that it would effectuate the Act to accept a nonadmission formal settlement in the unfair labor practice proceeding notwithstanding the absence of a provision dismissing the decertification petition in the representation proceeding inasmuch as there was no allegation in the complaint that the Respondent had initiated or aided the petition, and the complaint's 8(a)(1) and (5) allegations, while numerous, occurred over a 2-year period ending January 3, 1992, and appeared to be of a kind that could be remedied by a cease-and-desist order and posting of a notice.
This determination is within the General Counsel's remedial discretion.
See Nu-Aimco, supra.
Although the Union argues that it did in fact file a charge alleging unlawful employer assistance to the petition, as the Union acknowledges that charge was dismissed as untimely under Section 10(b), and the Board is without statutory authority to review that dismissal.
Moreover, the mere fact that the instant unfair labor practice settlement does not provide for dismissal of the decertification petition does not necessarily mean that the petition will not ultimately be dismissed.
Nothing in the instant settlement precludes the Regional Director from hereafter conducting an investigation in the representation case of the petition's showing of interest, or from dismissing the petition should that investigation reveal that the showing of interest was in fact tainted by the Employer's direct involvement in the decertification effort.1 The Regional Director retains the authority to do so, subject of course to a request for Board review under Section 102.71 of the Board's Rules and Regulations.
Finally, we note that nothing in the settlement record indicates whether the decertification petitioner 1 See Nu-Aimco, supra.
The Board's historical policy has been that a Regional Director may only dismiss a petition as tainted on the basis of his or her administrative investigation of the petition's showing of interest where that investigation has revealed direct employer involvement with the petition, e.g., supervisors circulating the petition, or supervisors threatening individual employees with discharge if they failed to sign the petition.
In this regard, we note that, as indicated above, the Union's unfair labor practice charge alleging unlawful assistance in initiating the petition and gathering signatures was dismissed as untimely, rather than on the merits.
would have been willing to join in a settlement which dismissed the petition.
As the Board recently held in Jefferson Hotel, 309 NLRB No. 103 (Nov. 30, 1992), absent such agreement by the decertification petitioner, any settlement provision that provided for the petition's dismissal would be without effect.
Right to hearing on objections.
The Third Circuit's view as expressed in Food 
Circuit.
See, e.g., NLRB v. Electrical Workers IBEW Local 357, 445 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir. 1971) (adopting Fifth Circuit view that a charging party need only be provided a hearing on any material issues of disputed fact presented by its objections); and Textile Workers v. NLRB, 294 F.2d 738 (D.C.
Cir. 1961), order enforced after remand 315 F.2d 41 (D.C.
Cir. 1963) (holding that regard must be had to the particular circumstances).
See also Ladies' Garment Workers Local 415Â­475 v. NLRB, 501 F.2d 823 (D.C.
Cir. 1974).
Here, the Union does not specifically contend that the first four of its objections raise any disputed issues of material fact, nor do those objections appear to do so on their face.
As for the Union's fifth objection regarding the settlement's failure to provide for dismissal of the allegedly tainted decertification petition, we find the Union's objection misplaced.
Even assuming that there are disputed issues of fact with respect to that objection, we find that a hearing on such an objection is unwarranted.
As indicated above, a Regional Director has discretion regarding whether to fully litigate unfair labor practice cases or to seek a settlement.
In the former instance, the litigation may result in a finding of unfair labor practices sufficient to ``taint'' the decertification petition and require its dismissal.
But absent such a finding--or admission of such unfair labor practices by the Respondent Employer--the petition should be processed unless the petitioner voluntarily agrees to dismissal of the petition as part of the settlement.
That is because the Board does not require that the petitioner be bound to a settlement by others that has the effect of waiving the petitioner's right under the Act to have the petition processed.
See Jefferson Hotel, supra.
This does not, however, extinguish the Regional Director's authority in the representation proceeding itself to investigate the showing of interest, or to dismiss the petition if the investigation reveals that the showing of interest was tainted by the Employer's direct involvement in the decertification effort.
Id., and footnote 1, supra.
In these circumstances, and given that the Board would not afford the Union a hearing in the representation proceeding itself on its al-
CANTER'S FAIRFAX RESTAURANT
885
legations of employer assistance to the petition,2 we find that a hearing in the instant proceeding on its similar objection to the settlement is unwarranted.
The settlement here fully remedies the allegations of the complaint, provides for the entry of a consent court judgment enforceable through contempt proceedings, and has been recommended for approval by the General Counsel.
In these circumstances, for the reasons set forth above we find that it would effectuate the purposes and policies of the Act to approve the settlement.
Accordingly, the settlement stipulation is approved and made a part of the record and the proceeding is transferred to and continued before the Board in Washington, D.C., for the entry of a Decision and Order pursuant to the provisions of the settlement stipulation.
On the basis of the settlement stipulation and on the entire record, the Board makes the following F INDINGS OF
INCLUDED: All cooks, dining room employees, bartenders and miscellaneous kitchen employees employed by Respondent at the facility located at 419 Fairfax Avenue, Los Angeles, California.
EXCLUDED: All bakery employees, office clerical employees, guards and supervisors as defined in the Act.

(2) Refusing to discuss with the Union discharges of unit employees.

(4) Failing and refusing to furnish the Union with information requested by the Union regarding the home addresses and telephone numbers of unit employees and the names of employees who had been tardy or had check mistakes during the previous 2 years, and the disciplinary action taken against these employees.
(5) Bypassing the Union and dealing directly with unit employees regarding health benefits or regarding any other term or condition of employment.
(b) Conditioning employment or reemployment or reinstatement of employees on their waiver of their right to engage in a lawful strike or other protected concerted activities.
(c) Interfering with employees' union activity by interrupting their conversations with members of the public during union demonstrations.
(d) Discriminatorily promulgating or applying a rule prohibiting unit employees from speaking to customers in a manner critical of the Respondent concerning the Respondent's labor dispute with the Union.
(e) Threatening to, or placing under citizen's arrest without justification, union representatives in the presence of employees.
(f) Telling employees the Respondent would never sign a contract with the Union.
(g) Falsely accusing a union representative of being a thief, and of having been fired for stealing, in the presence of employees.

(i) Threatening to have a union representative arrested, in front of customers and employees.
(j) Threatening a union representative with physical harm in front of employees.
(k) Implicitly or explicitly threatening picketing employees with physical harm. (l) Making grossly vulgar, obscene, or racist comments or gestures to picketing employees and/or to union representatives in the presence of employees.
