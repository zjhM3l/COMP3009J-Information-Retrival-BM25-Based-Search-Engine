A Hudson woman was arraigned on charges she allegedly left messages on a company website that threatened lives with the use of anthrax
, Attorney General Tom Reilly announced today.
Nancy McDonald, 52, of Hudson, was arraigned in Cambridge District Court.
McDonald is charged with one count of threatening to commit a crime and one count of assault.
She was ordered held on $10,000 cash bail.
"Anthrax pranksters out there need to know we will not take these incidents lightly," AG Reilly said.
"Making false threats and fostering an environment of fear in the workplace is not acceptable."
State Police assigned to AG Reilly's High Technology and Computer Crimes Division, assisted by police departments in Hudson and Berlin, executed a court-ordered search of McDonald's home in Hudson on Friday where a computer, among other items, was seized.
The investigation began October 19, when Cambridge-based Endeca Corp., a software solutions company, contacted AG Reilly's Office after a concerned employee reported that threatening messages had been left on a comment board found on the company website.
A total of four messages were allegedly left by McDonald on the comment board on three different days in October.
In the first message left on October 2, McDonald allegedly listed under the comment field "I need a million dollars of your software to repair the world trade center."
The same day, McDonald allegedly left another message, giving a false name of another Endeca employee and leaving profanity under the "job title" category.
Under comments, McDonald allegedly threatened a co-worker with a knife.
McDonald did not leave a message again until October 14 when she allegedly left a message using another Endeca employee's name, allegedly listing profanity as the "job title."
McDonald allegedly also listed "recipe for killing" under the heading "Interested for" and under comments she allegedly said an employee "is next on the antrax (sic) trail."
In the final message left October 17, McDonald allegedly listed "Taliban" under the company name and under the "Interested For:" The messages escalated in a threatening manner to the point McDonald allegedly made her reference to anthrax, threatening that the company's chief operating officer would be the next "on the anthrax trail."
Five days later, she allegedly left a message warning the company to watch their mail.
McDonald was employed at Endeca as a sales representative from March until July 2001.
Last week, AG Reilly warned that anthrax hoaxes would be investigated and prosecuted vigorously by his office.
He also called on the House to immediately pass his terroristic threats legislation.
In November 1999, AG Reilly first proposed the terroristic threats bill after a Missouri teen used online threats to terrorize the community of Townsend.
The bill passed the Senate September 25.
Senate Bill 174 would make it a crime to communicate a hijacking threat or threat to use a gun, bomb, chemical or biological agent or any other dangerous item if the threat causes the evacuation or disruption of a school, building, public transportation facility, airplane or other places of assembly, or leads to serious inconvenience or harm.
The bill covers threats that are communicated by any means.
The penalty for this new crime would be imprisonment for a maximum term of 20 years in state prison or six months to 2 Ã¯Â¿Â½ years in jail, by a maximum $50,000 fine, or both.
In cases, where a hoax substance did not affect a large number of people or result in an evacuation, AG Reilly will seek an amendment to the Chapter 266, Section 102A Ã¯Â¿Â½, to broaden it to cover "hoax devices" or "hoax substance."
This statute, which was enacted in April 2001, covers "Possession, Transportation, Use or Placement of Hoax Devices."
It carries a 5-year maximum state prison term.
AG Reilly has also proposed a change to another statute to address the actual use of biological or chemical weapons in the future.
The amendment would create a 20-year felony for the possession or use of harmful substances intended to injure, kill or destroy property.
All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.
Assistant Attorney General Ursula Knight is prosecuting the case, which was investigated by Massachusetts State Police assigned to AG Reilly's Office, with the assistance of the Hudson and Berlin Police Departments.
