He also called on the House to immediately pass his terroristic threats legislation and proposed amendments to existing statutes to cover the full range of threats, real and fake, as well as the possible future use of biological or chemical weapons.
The terroristic threats bill, which AG Reilly first proposed in November 1999 after a Missouri teen used online threats to terrorize the community of Townsend, passed the Senate September 25.
"With the anthrax hoaxes that we have seen in Massachusetts in the past few days, we want the public to know that we will not take these incidents lightly," AG Reilly said.
"We will prosecute under existing laws but we need stronger statutes to make sure that prosecutors have the tools they need to send this message."
Senate Bill 174 would make it a crime to communicate a hijacking threat or threat to use a gun, bomb, chemical or biological agent or any other dangerous item if the threat causes the evacuation or disruption of a school, building, public transportation facility, airplane or other places of assembly, or leads to serious inconvenience or harm.
The bill covers threats that are communicated by any means.
The penalty for this new crime would be imprisonment for a a maximum term of 20 years in state prison or six months to 2 Ã¯Â¿Â½ years in jail, by a maximum $50,000 fine, or both.
In cases where a hoax substance did not affect a large number of people or result in an evacuation, AG Reilly today said he would seek an amendment to the Chapter 266, Section 102A Ã¯Â¿Â½, to broaden it to cover "hoax devices" or "hoax substance."
This statute, which was enacted in April 2001, covers "Possession, Transportation, Use or Placement of Hoax Devices."
It carries a 5-year maximum state prison term.
AG Reilly also proposes a change to another statute to address the actual use of biological or chemical weapons in the future.
The amendment would create a 20-year felony for the possession or use of harmful substances intended to injure, kill or destroy property.
