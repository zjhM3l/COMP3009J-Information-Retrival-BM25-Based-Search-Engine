Colorado's Wildlife Company Winter 2003 __________________________________________________________________ Two roosting bald eagles The Eyes Have It: Why wildlife watching is good, for you and for the neighbors by Mary Taylor Young Do you have the winter doldrums? Christmas is over; the New Year has passed; the Super Bowl has come and gone.
Maybe youve spent the cold months indoors, playing video games, cruising the Internet, cooking, cleaning out the closets.
Youre tired of being cooped up indoors.
Aw, Mom, theres nothing to do! But Mom always knew the solutiongo outdoors and playand shes right.
As winter winds down and spring approaches, there are a host of events happening in nature that offer a different version of spectator sports.
These events have happened every spring for thousands of years, so its time you got out there and watched! Imagine a field filled with birdsnot small sparrows but birds that stand higher than your waist.
They bow and pirouette, prance and dance.
Above it all rises a rolling music of croaks and trills.
Theyre sandhill cranes and you can see them, playing this March in Colorado's own San Luis Valley.
bull moose Or how about visiting a secret spot on the prairie? As the sun comes up, prairie-chickens make their way onto a traditional courting ground.
This spot has been used by the birds for generations, and this year youre invited too.
Soon the prairie will be alive with wild chickens dancing and spinning.
Orange pouches on their necks swell up like balloons, then deflate, filling the morning with wheezing pops that sound like a bagpipe band warming up.
Its all happening in northeastern Colorado near the town of Wray.
Far across the state, theres another fellow to watch for.
He wont be dancing or singing, but a 1,000-pound bull moose doesnt have to do more than stand there to make your jaw drop.
The starting place for moose discovery is at the Moose Visitor Center in North Park, near Walden.
Are you interested yet? Wildlife watching is fun.
Its a wholesome activity ideal for family outings.
It doesnt cost a lot of money and it doesnt require any equipment, though binoculars will improve the view.
In this era when we all complain about too much stress, getting outdoors in nature to look at animals is one of the best ways to relax and de-stress.
Doe and twin fawns Were fortunate to live in a state with abundant wildlife, much of it fairly easy to see, if you go at the right times and to the right places.
Some knowledge of the animals habits will help too.
A good way to start wildlife viewing is to participate in an organized event, such as a festival with organized tours, lectures and workshops that teach about the animals and skills for enjoying them.
Inside this issue, youll find a guide to Colorado-wide spring festivals dedicated to wildlife.
Does wildlife watching make dollars and sense? Wildlife have always had economic value.
When Colorado was first settled, wildlife were harvested for food and to be sold to the market.
Animal pelts and skins were valuable commodities.
In the 20th century, recreational hunting and fishing grew in importance.
Today they generate millions of dollars annually for the state economy.
In recent decades, wildlife watching has grown to make a significant economic contribution, particularly in the communities watchers visit to see wildlife.
A PERSPECTIVE FROM 50 YEARS AGO WE NEED WILDLIFESome of us would wither spiritually if we could not occasionally get away from the artificiality of modern life and regain perspective through watching the ways of our wild neighbors.
But what about the average man; does he need this tonic? Is wildlife really important? . . .
Plainly wildlife is a resource of the first magnitude . . .
But how can we really put a dollar sign on anything as all-encompassing as nature? A monetary symbol can never express the beauty of a forest, the delicacy of a flower or the wonder of a thrushs song . . .
Each animal that exists today is the end result of hundreds of millions of years of evolution.
As the inheritors of the earth, it is our responsibility to see that our wild neighbors have living space and that no species is pushed out of existence.
from the National Wildlife Federation Wildlife Conservation Stamp Album, 1957
According to a 1996 US Fish and Wildlife Service survey, 62.9 million Americans fed, observed or photographed wildlife around their homes and on trips away from home in 1996.
They spent $29.2 billion on these activities, including $9.4 billion on trip-related costs, $16.7 billion for equipment, and $3.1 billion on dues and contributions to wildlife-related organizations, and magazines.
In Colorado in that year, wildlife watchers spent over $786 million on their hobby, which generated $23.6 million in sales tax revenue and $13.9 million in state income tax revenue.
It also accounted for 19,784 jobs.
These dollars have particular impact in small and rural communities such as Wray, Walden, Monte Vista and Hayden.
As opportunities emerge for local communities to realize the economic value to wildlife beyond directly harvesting the animals, the citizens whose land and neighborhoods are home to wildlife will have more incentives to support wildlife conservation.
So, how does watching wildlife help me and my neighbors? When you watch wildlife, particularly if you travel to different parts of the state, you not only de-stress and have fun, you benefit and support your fellow Coloradans.
Thats how wildlife watching is good, for you and for the neighborsboth human and animal!
