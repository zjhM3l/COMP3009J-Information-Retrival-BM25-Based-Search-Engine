12/07/2001 Sheep, several combined articles
There are no known cases of the BSE in the United States due to the active surveillance and import measures taken by the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the past ten years.
These and other federal and state agencies and industry groups have taken a series of actions to prevent the introduction of BSE into the US food supply.
For example, to prevent BSE from entering the United States, firm restrictions were placed on the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products including meat, meat-and-bone meal, offals, glands, etc., from countries where BSE was known to exist.
These restrictions were later extended to include importation of ruminants and certain ruminant products not only from BSE- positive countries, but also countries thought to be at high risk for BSE, even if the disease hadn't been identified in those countries.
In addition, FDA prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminants because this kind of feeding practice is believed to have initiated and amplified the outbreak of BSE in the United Kingdom.
Is the disease, BSE, affecting cattle in Europe the same as the disease, CWD, affecting elk and deer in the US? BSE is a disease of cattle.
However, a related disease, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), does occur in a small number of American elk and deer in certain parts of the country, particularly Colorado and Wyoming.
FDA is working closely with other government agencies and the public health community to address CWD in wild and domesticated herds.
Wildlife officials in Colorado and Wyoming have advised individuals not to harvest, handle, or consume any wild deer or elk, especially in those states, that appear to be sick, regardless of the cause.
CJD (New Var.), Tonsillitis and Transmission Speculation on the Role of Tonsillitis in Prion Transmission - ------------------------------------------------------------ Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) [previously abbreviated as CJD new var.] is the human form of mad cow disease.
The victims of vCJD may have succumbed to the disease because they ate contaminated beef when they were suffering from a bout of tonsillitis or a simple sore throat.
This theory has been advanced by a leading American scientist, Professor Stephen DeArmond, of the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF).
He said it could explain why relatively few people had been struck down with the illness so far and why so many of those who had were under the age of 35.
Scientists still know very little about why the vCJD seems to strike some people and not others.
To date, it has killed 94 people in the UK.
Another 8 are suspected sufferers and are still alive.
Researchers believe the illness is caused [when] infectious proteins called prions [are]
But the exact route remains a mystery.
Now, Professor DeArmond, one of the world's leading prion experts, has told the BBC that inflammation in the throat area of victims could be the key factor.
"All I am trying to do is search for something that would get the protein into the lymphoreticular system, particularly into the tonsils, and certainly some irritation there, injury or inflammation, might have been one way that these 90-odd people were unlucky," he said.
The tonsils are an important focus for research because they are known to be a reservoir for prions.
It is this fact that has prompted British hospitals to dispose of all surgical implements used in tonsillectomies, to counter the very slight risk that the equipment could pass vCJD from one patient to another.
But Professor DeArmond said serious consideration was now being given to the idea that the tonsils were the route through which the primary infection from cattle to humans occurred.
"Why does it [the infection] get into the tonsils for instance and it doesn't happen in sporadic CJD or any other forms of CJD that we know of.
"Could it be that these patients had a sore throat and they were just unlucky that they ate a sausage or a meat pie that had a lot of BSE brain associated with it? "Again, I'm trying to think of any other factor that would explain why a relatively small number of individuals would get the disease."
With perhaps 30 to 40 percent of the British population having the genetic make-up susceptible to vCJD infection, and so many contaminated meals eaten over the years, Professor DeArmond said one could have expected many more victims to have emerged by now.
However, if sore throats had acted as a contributory, but limiting, factor, it might also explain the age profile of vCJD victims.
"Young people go through a lot of colds and sore throats that you become immune to later in life," Professor DeArmond said.
"As you get older, you experience more viruses and you reach a stage where you become less susceptible to these problems."
Researchers in the UK said the ideas expressed by Professor DeArmond were plausible but nothing had been proven.
"The truth is we don't know what the reason is for the particular age distribution of the vCJD cases that have been observed so far," said Professor Peter Smith, the Acting Chairman of the government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC).
"There are a lot of changes that take place around adolescence.
Other people have suggested for example that it may be related to the sort of changes in teeth that take place at around that age - with some dental procedures there may be a risk.
"These are all possible hypotheses but we really don't know."
The UCSF professor is a colleague of Stanley Prusiner, the scientist honoured with a Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on prions.
Californian researchers are now developing a therapy that will block the action of infectious prions.
The therapy, which has shown promise in the lab, will go into animal trials in the next 12 months.
If these experiments are successful, they could lead to an effective treatment for spongiform diseases in humans within 10 years, Professor DeArmond said.
AIDS and Mad Cow Disease: Two Epidemics That Are Alike Feb. 4 2001 N.Y.
Times Donald G. McNeil Jr. http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/04/weekinreview/04MCNE.html?pagewanted= all Paris -- Strictly speaking, according to this story, there is no connection between AIDS and mad cow disease.
The first is caused by a retrovirus, which overpowers the genetic material of cells, forcing them to create duplicates.
The second is caused by a prion, an infectious protein that seems to "persuade" other proteins to imitate its abnormal folds.
Whales and mosquitoes have more in common.
So why even discuss it? Because, the story cites scientists as saying, the dissimilarities end there, and there may be some lessons for politicians and public health officials in considering how the two epidemics are alike.
For one, the story says, both seem to have originated in a fairly obvious species transfer that seems to have involved a not-very-obvious trip to the dinner table: AIDS is believed to be a mutation of a virus from chimpanzees, which are butchered and eaten in central Africa.
Scientists believe that new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome, the human form of mad cow disease, comes, obviously, from cattle.
The story says that cattle, which are not normally carnivores, probably were first infected by eating meal containing the ground-up carcasses of sheep who died of scrapie, another prion disease.
We play with the food chain at our epidemiological peril.
Also, both diseases had gone global before anyone realized it.
AIDS started in Africa, but it wasn't described until perhaps 30 years later, when it decimated the clienteles of gay bars in San Francisco and New York.
It took another decade for the world to realize that African "slim" was the same disease and that it was far more widespread in Africa than in America.
Dr. Max Essex, chairman of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health, was cited as saying that part of that primal fear is that neither disease is well understood.
And, when scientists can't easily translate a disease into populist terms, the public gets nervous.
The analogy some biologists use to explain prions is ice-nine, a conceit of the Kurt Vonnegut novel "Cat's Cradle," a crystal that "teaches" water to stack and crystallize in the same pattern.
The fictional result is not reassuring:it touches the ocean, and the world freezes.
The story says that mot surprisingly, in the early days of epidemics, scientists flail around.
Now, fearing mad cow, the United States has banned blood donations from anyone who lived in Britain for six months in the 1980's.
But there may be no point, since prions are found in the brain, spine and gut, not in blood, and may not be transmitted that way.
Dr. David L. Heymann, the executive director in charge of communicable diseases for the World Health Organization, was quoted as saying, "We have to make recommendations based on limited information, but it's better to be on the conservative side and change the rules later."
The story adds that official reassurances also played an embarrassing role in mad cow disease.
The epidemic's most enduring image is Britain's agriculture minister, John Gummer, feeding his 4-year-old daughter a hamburger on TV in 1990 to prove that British beef was safe.
The story notes that in the 1500's, with the appearance of syphilis in Europe, sailors were rightly suspected, but the English called it the French pox and the French called it the Genoese pox.
In fact, it seems to have come from American Indians, who gave it to Columbus's men, some of whom fought at the siege of Genoa.
(The Old World's thank-you gift was smallpox, which did far more damage.)
Mad cow disease has followed a similar pattern of jingoistic blame.
British beef was banned in 1989 by other Europeans, who hooted at the "rosbifs."
But after cases turned up in France, Italian protesters closed the border to French beef last year.
Until November, Germany's agriculture minister claimed the country was "immune."
Now he is abashed.
Besides blaming other countries, some blame human sinfulness.
Religious conservatives called AIDS divine revenge on homosexuals, forgetting that it first killed a lot of hemophiliac children.
Animal rights groups say omnivorous humans are getting what they deserve for raising cattle in so beastly a fashion.
Throughout the Middle Ages, plague outbreaks inspired flagellants to walk from town to town whipping themselves to atone for the sins of others.
Lastly, there is one other similarity between the two diseases: catching them usually involves a certain amount of fun, which makes them dangerous.
And, the story goes on to say, that opens the door to politics, which rarely interferes with containment schemes for flu or Ebola.
Dr. David Nabarro, a W.H.O. official, was cited as recalling disagreeing long ago with an epidemiologist who had published an article suggesting that AIDS was going to kill vast numbers of Europeans, adding, "Aren't you overstating the risk?" he asked.
The answer he got was: "It doesn't matter, does it? UK Watchdogs Want Stricter Tests on Foreign Beef Feb. 4 2001 Reuters/ Agence France Presse English London -- The UK Food Safety Agency (FSA) was cited as saying on Saturday it was investigating deliveries to Eastbourne, southern England, and Northern Ireland that contained spinal cord, banned under Europe-wide measures to contain BSE and its human equivalent vCJD.
Professor Mac Johnston of the Scientific and Veterinary Committee for Public Health was quoted as telling BBC radio that, "We have got to treat this very, very seriously so that we can continue to assure the British consumer that our meat is safe,".
The story says that the banned material discovered in Eastbourne on Friday had been imported from Germany, marked "fit for human consumption."
The same meat cutting plant received a German consignment of beef last Monday which was found to contain two inches of spinal cord.
The Gulf Arab state of Qatar was cited as banning imports of beef products from European Union countries on Sunday because of fears over mad cow disease.
"The move is a precautionary measure, although no trace of the disease have been found in Qatar so far," Ahmed Kamal Naji, a senior official at the Ministry of Public Health, told reporters.
Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany was quoted as saying in an interview with the French newspaper L'Humanite to be published on Tuesday that since the EU took the decision that all cows over 30 months must be screened for BSE, "it has become extremely difficult to sell animals who have passed that age.
The best way to revive the market is to begin the (screening) process as quickly as possible."
He added screening was "the only way to beat the crisis and to restore the confidence of consumers."
The screening process is likely to add to the consumer cost of beef -- testing will cost 500 francs (76 euros, 72 dollars), of which 100 francs will be paid by the state.
Should an animal test positive, its carcass and by-products would be destroyed.
If the result was later confirmed by the French food safety agency, the entire herd would have to be slaughtered.
Should it test negative, it would be allowed to re-enter the human food chain.
Beijing has issued a ban on imports of European Union meat-and-bone feeds in an effort to prevent mad cow disease spreading to China, according to official press reports.
The move, announced Saturday in an agriculture ministry notice, comes into force today, the China Daily reported.
UK processed meat products containing beef imported from the European Union should present a lower risk to consumers thanks to a new EU-wide testing programme being instituted today.
Professor Peter Smith, the Government's leading adviser on the issue, said the new programme, introduced following BSE cases in France Germany and Spain, will involve tests on all cattle aged over 30 months which are destined for human consumption.
Prof Smith, acting chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, said that the tests would reduce the risk of eating infected beef, but did not guarantee that food was 100% safe.
The European Union renewed its attack on German handling of the mad cow crisis Sunday, with a top official saying the union warned Germany nine months ago that its cattle were probably infected, a newspaper reported.
David Byrne, the group's health and consumer affairs commissioner, told Welt am Sonntag that the European Union sent German Agriculture Minister Karl-Heinz Funke a study in March predicting that German cows were carrying the disease.
Byrne said he was puzzled when Funke continued insisting that German beef was safe, the newspaper said.
Beefing Down? Not in America, Where Mad-Cow Concerns Don't Amount to Much Dec. 31 2000 Denver Rocky Mountain News Debra Melani According to this story, while stories of nvCJD and BSE have alarmed Europe, they seem to be having little effect in Colorado and the rest of the country.
Sara O'Hagan, spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association was quoted as saying, "Our beef demand is up for the first time in 20 years."
Likewise, buyers for Colorado grocers report no slack in sales or any particular concern among customers.
Linda Detwiler, senior staff veterinarian with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in New Jersey was quoted as saying, "There has never been a (mad cow) case in the United States.
We've looked now at about 12,000 (cow) brains with no evidence."
Phil Seng, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Meat Export Federation was cited as saying on Wednesday that U.S. beef sales to Japan, the largest overseas buyer of U.S. beef, have dropped by about half since a single case of mad cow disease was confirmed there last month, and losses in U.S. beef exports could reach $1 billion if the drop continues, adding, "What we are looking at at this point in time is probably a 50 percent reduction in U.S. (beef) exports to that market."
The story says that last year, the U.S. shipped about $1.8 billion worth of beef and beef products to Japan, or about a third of all U.S. beef exports.
Seng was further cited as saying that the Japanese economy was struggling prior to September, and the loss of business because of the BSE will add to the country's problems, adding, "To me the BSE issue is such a major issue that I would have to say it is probably the largest peacetime catastrophe that they have ever had in Japan since World War Two."
New Finding May Identify Unknown Agents of Mad-Cow Disease
July 27, 2001
>
The researchers also devised a screening test that can be used to pinpoint unidentified prions, making it the first such genetic assay for these mysterious biological agents.
The findings are reported in the July 27 issue of the journal Cell by UIC biology professor Susan Liebman and three co-workers.
A prion, the causative agent of "mad cow" disease and human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, is an improperly folded protein molecule that clumps together and corrupts other, healthy molecules of the same protein to do likewise, in domino fashion.
When the cell divides, the corrupt protein is contained in both daughter cells, where it seeds the process again.
Prions are thus infective and heritable without containing DNA or RNA as viruses do.
According to Liebman, the finding that one prion can help start the chain reaction in another, totally different protein is important, because much more is known about how prions propagate than about how they first appear--which also bears on public health concerns.
Most cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a neurodegenerative disease in humans, have no known origin, she said.
"It's a great concern that humans can acquire CJD from infected cattle, but far, far more cases arise spontaneously," Liebman said.
Liebman's team devised a genetic screen for a trait in yeast that sparked the appearance of a known yeast prion.
Their test identified the protein responsible for this trait and also pointed to nine other yeast prion-like proteins causing the same trait.
These new prion candidates were found to contain prion-like regions in their protein chains.
"We think what we have is a general test for new prions," Liebman said.
Liebman thinks it is likely that humans have more than just the one prion, though no others are yet known, and that these prions may be related to the appearance of CJD.
"It seems unlikely that yeast would have several prions and mammals only one," she said.
"It would also seem possible that the sudden, unexplained appearance of the CJD prion may depend on other, 'non-toxic' prions."
The triggering of the CJD prion by another, hidden prion may explain why CJD strikes more often in older people, Liebman said.
They would have had more time to acquire silent prions.
"These findings make all prions, even supposedly benign ones, more important," she said.
Liebman's co-authors on the Cell paper are research assistant professor Irina Derkatch, graduate student Michael Bradley and research specialist Joo Hong, all of UIC.
The research was funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, one of the National Institutes of Health.
Auburn University "Peak of Excellence" to Unveil Mad-Cow Disease Detection Technology
July 27, 2001
Auburn University Release
Auburn University, Alabama The Auburn University Detection and Food Safety Center (AUDFS), named an Auburn University Peak of Excellence in 1999, will present to industrial representatives technology designed to prevent mad-cow disease.
The center has invited representatives of the food processing, food packaging, agricultural feed, diagnostic equipment development, and diagnostic testing industries to its inaugural technology conference.
At this conference, the 14 core center researchers and their associates all Auburn University faculty, staff and students will unveil patented and patent-pending technology for the identification of pathogens in food and feed products.
One of these technologies is key to preventing the entrance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad-cow disease, into the U.S. food chain.
The major source of BSE transmission is through the ingestion of livestock feed contaminated with tainted meat-and-bone meal ruminants.
The remains of dead animals are often ground and mixed in agricultural feed as a source of protein.
The remains, or ruminants, can carry the mad-cow disease to other animals.
The Food and Drug Administration has recently mandated strict requirements on the content of livestock feed to prevent the spread of BSE to the United States.
However, diagnostic methods to ascertain these contents, a component necessary to enforce the ban, are currently lacking.
To date, all blind samples of livestock feed submitted to Auburn University for contaminated meat-and-bone meal testing have been correctly identified using the universitys patent-pending technology.
This technology is one of several inventions that will be available for immediate commercial licensing following the conference.
AUDFS is working to combine advances in the identification of foodborne illnesses and contaminants with the latest in biosensor technology.
This research will one-day lead to a system of monitoring food products from production to consumption, thereby eliminating or significantly reducing the threat of foodborne bacterial pathogens and toxins reaching our dinner tables and restaurants.
The conference will include over 20 technical posters outlining research into the detection of E. coli, Salmonella and Legionella.
The posters will summarize work toward other supportive components of food safety research, including education and outreach efforts, and biosensor development.
The conference is scheduled for Aug. 1 and 2.
Events are scheduled for both the Auburn University Hotel and Dixon Conference Center, and various locations on the Auburn University campus.
Because of the technical and research nature of the information being presented, participants are required to sign nondisclosure agreements with Auburn University before attending.
The Auburn University Detection and Food Safety Center is one of seven university Peaks of Excellence.
The research center, based in the Materials Research and Education Center, is a multi-disciplinary effort involving, at its core, five Auburn University colleges: Sam Ginn College of Engineering, College of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agriculture, College of Sciences and Mathematics and the College of Human Sciences.
Faculty from other campus colleges and departments collaborate with core faculty members on research funded by federal agencies and private industry.
The center is under the direction of Dr. Bryan A. Chin, professor and chair of the Materials Research and Education Center.
The AUDFS web site http://audfs.eng.auburn.edu presents an overview of the centers research objectives, industrial partnership program and technology advancements to date.
For more information about the center or its upcoming conference, contact Michael J. Tullier, AUDFS industrial relations coordinator, at (334) 844-3419, or mtullier@eng.auburn.edu.

CVM UPDATE "FDA-DIV.
OF FED-STATE RELATIONS" DFSR@ORA.FDA.GOV We are providing advance information pertaining to a "CVM Update/CVM Provides Information about ruminant Feed (BSE) Inspections" which is scheduled for issue the afternoon of April 20.
More detailed information is scheduled to be posted on FDA/Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM) Home Page at http://www.fda.gov/cvm/efoi/efoi.html.
Listed below for your information is the ANNOUNCEMENT advising of the posting of state-wide BSE inspection data in spreadsheet format from CVM's database of inspectional information.
CVM Update April 19, 2001 CVM Provide Information About Ruminant Feed (BSE) Inspections A spreadsheet containing information about inspections conducted under the FDA's ruminant feed (BSE) rule has been posted on FDA/Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM's) Home Page at: http://www.fda.gov/cvm/efoi/efoi.html.
This feed rule, that prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in feeds for ruminant animals, was implemented to prevent the establishment and amplification of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) through feed in the United States.
The rule became effective on August 4, 1997.
Inspections of over 10,000 renderers, feed mills, ruminant feeders, and others (such as protein blenders) have been conducted to determine compliance with the BSE feed regulations.
CVM has assembled information from the inspections that have been conducted, and this information is included in the spreadsheet.
The name, city, State, and type of facility are included for each firm that has been inspected.
The dates of the inspections and the violations for each inspection are also included.
The listing is organized alphabetically by the State in which the inspected facility is located.
The information presented in the spreadsheet is from CVM's database of inspectional information.
This database is dynamic and changing frequently as additional inspectional information is received by CVM and entered into its database.
Each entry represents an individual inspection.
The information being presented may include some duplicates and differences in addresses and firm names.
As CVM reviews the information, in addition to eliminating duplicates and assuring addresses are entered the same, any errors in the firm type and spellings will be corrected as discovered.
CVM hopes to be able to update the information posted on its Home Page on a monthly basis.
From: "FDA-Division of Federal-State Relations" 
There is no evidence to date of BSE affecting American cattle.
Does BSE affect humans?
BSE is a disease that affects cattle.
However, there is a disease similar to BSE called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), or vCJD, which is found in humans.
There have been a small number of cases of vCJD reported, primarily in the United Kingdom, occurring in people who consumed beef contaminated with an infective agent
.
[(As
of February 2001, there have been a total of 92 cases of vCJD worldwide-including 88 in the U.K., three in France and one in Ireland.)
There is strong scientific evidence (epidemiological and laboratory) that the agent that causes BSE in cattle is the agent that causes vCJD in people.
There are no reported cases of vCJD in the United States.
The disease, vCJD, which primarily affects younger persons, is very hard to diagnose until the disease has nearly run its course.
In its early stages, the disease may manifest itself through neurologic symptoms but it is not until the latter stages of the disease that brain abnormalities detectable by xray or MRI can be seen.
Is it possible to get vCJD from eating food purchased in the United States? The disease, vCJD, has been associated with the consumption of foods produced from BSE infected animals.
Because BSE has never been found in the U.S., it is unlikely that food purchased in the US such as at a grocery store or restaurant would be contaminated.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has restricted the importation of live ruminants, such as cows and sheep, and food products from these animals from BSE countries since 1989, and from all European countries since 1997.
Thus it is highly unlikely that a person would contract vCJD today by eating food purchased in the United States.
It is important for consumers to know that:
* No meat products from the 31 countries identified as having BSE or at risk for having BSE are allowed in the U.S.
This includes meat products used in human, animal, and pet foods.
Milk and milk products continue to be imported into the US from these countries because milk and milk products are not believed to pose any risk for transmitting BSE to humans.
Experiments have shown that milk from BSE-infected cows has not caused infections in the same species or in other test animals.
* FDA requires that gelatin-containing products such as candy or capsules imported from the 31 countries identified as having BSE or at risk for having BSE be manufactured under specific guidance and certified as such to ensure they are safe for American consumers.
FDA guidelines require gelatin to be made from non-BSE herds and use only specific parts of BSE-free animals in the rendering process.
* Dietary supplements and certain cosmetic ingredients containing bovine materials from animals originating in the 31 countries where BSE has been found or is at risk for being found, are excluded from the US.
* What is being done to determine whether the newly recognized vCJD is occurring in the United States? With heightened concern about vCJD in Europe, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have enhanced their vCJD surveillance in the U.S.
To date, there have been no cases of vCJD identified in the United States.
What is the current risk to American consumers traveling to Europe of acquiring vCJD? In the United Kingdom, the current risk appears to be extremely small, perhaps about 1 case per 10 billion servings of beef.
In the other countries of Europe, the current risk, if it exists at all, would not likely be any higher than that in the United Kingdom, except possibly in Portugal.
In the 12-month period ending June 15, 2000, Portugal had about half the reported incidence of BSE cases per 1 million adult cattle as that reported in the United Kingdom; however, Portugal has only recently implemented BSE-related public health control measures.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the current risk of acquiring vCJD from any specific country cannot be precisely determined because cattle products from one country might be distributed and consumed in others.
For travelers concerned about reducing their possible risk of acquiring vCJD from food, CDC suggests:
(1) when traveling in Europe, avoid eating beef and beef products or (2) when traveling in Europe, eat only select beef or beef products, such as solid pieces of muscle meat (versus ground beef products such as burgers and sausages that contain meat from various parts of the animal).
Solid pieces of muscle meat may have less opportunity for contamination with tissues such as the brain or spinal cord that might harbor the BSE agent.
Milk and milk products from cows are not believed to pose any risk for transmitting the BSE agent because experiments have shown that milk from BSE-infected cows has not caused BSE in cows or other test animals.
When and how did BSE in cattle occur?
BSE has been of great concern since 1986, when it was first reported among cattle in the United Kingdom.
At its peak, in January 1993, almost 1,000 new cases per week were identified.
The outbreak in the United Kingdom may have started from the feeding of scrapie-contaminated sheep meat-and-bone meal to cattle.
Scrapie is a disease of sheep that is related to BSE in cattle.
There is strong evidence that the outbreak in cattle was amplified in the United Kingdom by feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.
The nature of the transmissible agent in BSE is not known.
Currently, the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified form of a normal cell surface component known as a prion protein, which is a pathogenic form of the protein.
Why or how this substance changes to become disease-producing is still unknown.
Prions are resistant to common treatments, such as heat, to reduce or eliminate its infectivity or presence.
What countries have reported cases of BSE or are considered to have a substantial risk associated with BSE? These countries are: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia, The Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom (Great Britain including Northern Ireland and the Falkland Islands).
Is BSE Affecting Cattle in the United States?
There are no known cases of the BSE in the United States due to the active surveillance and import measures taken by the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the past ten years.
These and other federal and state agencies and industry groups have taken a series of actions to prevent the introduction of BSE into the US food supply.
For example, to prevent BSE from entering the United States, firm restrictions were placed on the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products including meat, meat-and-bone meal, offals, glands, etc., from countries where BSE was known to exist.
These restrictions were later extended to include importation of ruminants and certain ruminant products not only from BSE- positive countries, but also countries thought to be at high risk for BSE, even if the disease hadn't been identified in those countries.
In addition, FDA prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminants because this kind of feeding practice is believed to have initiated and amplified the outbreak of BSE in the United Kingdom.
Is the disease, BSE, affecting cattle in Europe the same as the disease, CWD, affecting elk and deer in the US? BSE is a disease of cattle.
However, a related disease, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), does occur in a small number of American elk and deer in certain parts of the country, particularly Colorado and Wyoming.
FDA is working closely with other government agencies and the public health community to address CWD in wild and domesticated herds.
Wildlife officials in Colorado and Wyoming have advised individuals not to harvest, handle, or consume any wild deer or elk, especially in those states, that appear to be sick, regardless of the cause.
CJD (New Var.), Tonsillitis and Transmission Speculation on the Role of Tonsillitis in Prion Transmission - ------------------------------------------------------------ Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) [previously abbreviated as CJD new var.] is the human form of mad cow disease.
The victims of vCJD may have succumbed to the disease because they ate contaminated beef when they were suffering from a bout of tonsillitis or a simple sore throat.
This theory has been advanced by a leading American scientist, Professor Stephen DeArmond, of the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF).
He said it could explain why relatively few people had been struck down with the illness so far and why so many of those who had were under the age of 35.
Scientists still know very little about why the vCJD seems to strike some people and not others.
To date, it has killed 94 people in the UK.
Another 8 are suspected sufferers and are still alive.
Researchers believe the illness is caused [when] infectious proteins called prions [are]
But the exact route remains a mystery.
Now, Professor DeArmond, one of the world's leading prion experts, has told the BBC that inflammation in the throat area of victims could be the key factor.
"All I am trying to do is search for something that would get the protein into the lymphoreticular system, particularly into the tonsils, and certainly some irritation there, injury or inflammation, might have been one way that these 90-odd people were unlucky," he said.
The tonsils are an important focus for research because they are known to be a reservoir for prions.
It is this fact that has prompted British hospitals to dispose of all surgical implements used in tonsillectomies, to counter the very slight risk that the equipment could pass vCJD from one patient to another.
But Professor DeArmond said serious consideration was now being given to the idea that the tonsils were the route through which the primary infection from cattle to humans occurred.
"Why does it [the infection] get into the tonsils for instance and it doesn't happen in sporadic CJD or any other forms of CJD that we know of.
"Could it be that these patients had a sore throat and they were just unlucky that they ate a sausage or a meat pie that had a lot of BSE brain associated with it? "Again, I'm trying to think of any other factor that would explain why a relatively small number of individuals would get the disease."
With perhaps 30 to 40 percent of the British population having the genetic make-up susceptible to vCJD infection, and so many contaminated meals eaten over the years, Professor DeArmond said one could have expected many more victims to have emerged by now.
However, if sore throats had acted as a contributory, but limiting, factor, it might also explain the age profile of vCJD victims.
"Young people go through a lot of colds and sore throats that you become immune to later in life," Professor DeArmond said.
"As you get older, you experience more viruses and you reach a stage where you become less susceptible to these problems."
Researchers in the UK said the ideas expressed by Professor DeArmond were plausible but nothing had been proven.
"The truth is we don't know what the reason is for the particular age distribution of the vCJD cases that have been observed so far," said Professor Peter Smith, the Acting Chairman of the government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC).
"There are a lot of changes that take place around adolescence.
Other people have suggested for example that it may be related to the sort of changes in teeth that take place at around that age - with some dental procedures there may be a risk.
"These are all possible hypotheses but we really don't know."
The UCSF professor is a colleague of Stanley Prusiner, the scientist honoured with a Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on prions.
Californian researchers are now developing a therapy that will block the action of infectious prions.
The therapy, which has shown promise in the lab, will go into animal trials in the next 12 months.
If these experiments are successful, they could lead to an effective treatment for spongiform diseases in humans within 10 years, Professor DeArmond said.
AIDS and Mad Cow Disease: Two Epidemics That Are Alike Feb. 4 2001 N.Y.
Times Donald G. McNeil Jr. http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/04/weekinreview/04MCNE.html?pagewanted= all Paris -- Strictly speaking, according to this story, there is no connection between AIDS and mad cow disease.
The first is caused by a retrovirus, which overpowers the genetic material of cells, forcing them to create duplicates.
The second is caused by a prion, an infectious protein that seems to "persuade" other proteins to imitate its abnormal folds.
Whales and mosquitoes have more in common.
So why even discuss it? Because, the story cites scientists as saying, the dissimilarities end there, and there may be some lessons for politicians and public health officials in considering how the two epidemics are alike.
For one, the story says, both seem to have originated in a fairly obvious species transfer that seems to have involved a not-very-obvious trip to the dinner table: AIDS is believed to be a mutation of a virus from chimpanzees, which are butchered and eaten in central Africa.
Scientists believe that new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome, the human form of mad cow disease, comes, obviously, from cattle.
The story says that cattle, which are not normally carnivores, probably were first infected by eating meal containing the ground-up carcasses of sheep who died of scrapie, another prion disease.
We play with the food chain at our epidemiological peril.
Also, both diseases had gone global before anyone realized it.
AIDS started in Africa, but it wasn't described until perhaps 30 years later, when it decimated the clienteles of gay bars in San Francisco and New York.
It took another decade for the world to realize that African "slim" was the same disease and that it was far more widespread in Africa than in America.
Dr. Max Essex, chairman of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health, was cited as saying that part of that primal fear is that neither disease is well understood.
And, when scientists can't easily translate a disease into populist terms, the public gets nervous.
The analogy some biologists use to explain prions is ice-nine, a conceit of the Kurt Vonnegut novel "Cat's Cradle," a crystal that "teaches" water to stack and crystallize in the same pattern.
The fictional result is not reassuring:it touches the ocean, and the world freezes.
The story says that mot surprisingly, in the early days of epidemics, scientists flail around.
Now, fearing mad cow, the United States has banned blood donations from anyone who lived in Britain for six months in the 1980's.
But there may be no point, since prions are found in the brain, spine and gut, not in blood, and may not be transmitted that way.
Dr. David L. Heymann, the executive director in charge of communicable diseases for the World Health Organization, was quoted as saying, "We have to make recommendations based on limited information, but it's better to be on the conservative side and change the rules later."
The story adds that official reassurances also played an embarrassing role in mad cow disease.
The epidemic's most enduring image is Britain's agriculture minister, John Gummer, feeding his 4-year-old daughter a hamburger on TV in 1990 to prove that British beef was safe.
The story notes that in the 1500's, with the appearance of syphilis in Europe, sailors were rightly suspected, but the English called it the French pox and the French called it the Genoese pox.
In fact, it seems to have come from American Indians, who gave it to Columbus's men, some of whom fought at the siege of Genoa.
(The Old World's thank-you gift was smallpox, which did far more damage.)
Mad cow disease has followed a similar pattern of jingoistic blame.
British beef was banned in 1989 by other Europeans, who hooted at the "rosbifs."
But after cases turned up in France, Italian protesters closed the border to French beef last year.
Until November, Germany's agriculture minister claimed the country was "immune."
Now he is abashed.
Besides blaming other countries, some blame human sinfulness.
Religious conservatives called AIDS divine revenge on homosexuals, forgetting that it first killed a lot of hemophiliac children.
Animal rights groups say omnivorous humans are getting what they deserve for raising cattle in so beastly a fashion.
Throughout the Middle Ages, plague outbreaks inspired flagellants to walk from town to town whipping themselves to atone for the sins of others.
Lastly, there is one other similarity between the two diseases: catching them usually involves a certain amount of fun, which makes them dangerous.
And, the story goes on to say, that opens the door to politics, which rarely interferes with containment schemes for flu or Ebola.
Dr. David Nabarro, a W.H.O. official, was cited as recalling disagreeing long ago with an epidemiologist who had published an article suggesting that AIDS was going to kill vast numbers of Europeans, adding, "Aren't you overstating the risk?" he asked.
The answer he got was: "It doesn't matter, does it? UK Watchdogs Want Stricter Tests on Foreign Beef Feb. 4 2001 Reuters/ Agence France Presse English London -- The UK Food Safety Agency (FSA) was cited as saying on Saturday it was investigating deliveries to Eastbourne, southern England, and Northern Ireland that contained spinal cord, banned under Europe-wide measures to contain BSE and its human equivalent vCJD.
Professor Mac Johnston of the Scientific and Veterinary Committee for Public Health was quoted as telling BBC radio that, "We have got to treat this very, very seriously so that we can continue to assure the British consumer that our meat is safe,".
The story says that the banned material discovered in Eastbourne on Friday had been imported from Germany, marked "fit for human consumption."
The same meat cutting plant received a German consignment of beef last Monday which was found to contain two inches of spinal cord.
The Gulf Arab state of Qatar was cited as banning imports of beef products from European Union countries on Sunday because of fears over mad cow disease.
"The move is a precautionary measure, although no trace of the disease have been found in Qatar so far," Ahmed Kamal Naji, a senior official at the Ministry of Public Health, told reporters.
A sign reading "Danger Zone" lies at the entrance to a memorial dedicated to the guinea pigs that died here in the name of science.
Soon cows will be sent to this island -- their mission, to incubate mad cow disease under the watchful eye of the researchers.
Four cows have been sent to this 24 hectare (60 acre) island near Ruegen in the Baltic Sea and they are being held in a sealed stable.
Raffi, Manfred, Otto and Luzie are the healthy relatives of cattle that contracted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease.
Other cattle will probably arrive in the summer says Professor Thomas Mettenleiter, the president of the federal office for research on transmissible animal diseases.
That, he says, is when the animals will be injected with the disease.
Thirty to 50 cows will be studied over the next four to six years before being slaughtered, dissected and analysed.
These sorts of programmes already exist in Britain, France and Switzerland, "but this will be a first for Germany," says Professor Mettenleiter.
"Now that we have mad cows in Germany, we are going to push our research to the limit in this sector," he says.
Federal funding has been earmarked for the project.
Riems will receive additional personnel and around 102 million euros (96 million dollars) over the next five years, with more than five million going to a special research unit known locally as the "BSE Institute," which was inaugurated on January 1.
Around 1,000 people protested on Saturday in this northern French town against a decision to stock banned animal meal in a requisitioned depot.
The demonstrators, which police said numbered 800 but organisers claimed were as many as 1,300, said the site chosen was ill-suited to hold feed which is banned because of fears it may cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or madcow disease.
"We are tired of being rolled around," said one banner, while a second displayed in front of the town hall read: "Village for sale."
Subject: Brazil Update All media inquiries must go to Kevin Herglotz (202) 720-9326 and/or Jerry Redding (202) 720-6959 USDA Temporarily Suspends Brazilian Beef Imports into the U.S.
Washington, Feb. 2, 2001 Following close consultations with Brazilian government officials, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) today announced that it is temporarily suspending the import of processed beef and associated products from Brazil.
This decision is a temporary action pending the release of requested data to complete a bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk assessment.
USDA is working with Brazilian agriculture officials to expeditiously complete a risk assessment regarding this matter.
Once this data has been received and USDA is assured that Brazil has taken sound measures to prevent BSE, the suspension will be lifted.
There is no evidence of BSE in Brazil.
USDA, along with appropriate federal health agencies, will continue to monitor and assess this situation and take any additional actions that may be necessary or appropriate.
USDA's BSE policy has been to be proactive and preventative.
USDA has taken stringent measures in surveillance, prevention, education and response.
Import restrictions in countries known to have BSE have been in place since 1989 and active surveillance efforts began in 1990.
News Release Texas Animal Health Commission Box l2966 *Austin, Texas 78711 *(800) 550-8242* FAX (512) 719-0719 Linda Logan, DVM, PhD* Executive Director For info, contact Carla Everett, information officer, at 1-800-550-8242, ext. 710,or ceverett@tahc.state.tx.us For Immediate Release-- Feed Contamination Issue Resolved by FDA Although many of you may have heard the latest regarding the resolution of the cattle feed contamination situation in Texas, I wanted to ensure that you received this statement issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency in charge of regulating feed components.
The FDA has said the cattle involved are to be rendered and the material will not enter ruminant or human food channels.
The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) will provided assistance to the FDA as requested and needed.
For Immediate Release Print Media: 301-827-6242 P01-05 Broadcast Media: 301-827-3434 January 30, 2001 Consumer Inquiries: 888-Info-FDA FDA Announces Test Results From Texas Feed Lot Today the Food and Drug Administration announced the results of tests taken on feed used at a Texas feedlot that was suspected of containing meat and bone meal from other domestic cattle -- a violation of FDA's 1997 prohibition on using ruminant material in feed for other ruminants.
Results indicate that a very low level of prohibited material was found in the feed fed to cattle.
FDA has determined that each animal could have consumed, at most and in total, five-and-one-half grams - approximately a quarter ounce -- of prohibited material.
These animals weigh approximately 600 pounds.
It is important to note that the prohibited material was domestic in origin (therefore not likely to contain infected material because there is no evidence of BSE in U.S. cattle), fed at a very low level, and fed only once.
The potential risk of BSE to such cattle is therefore exceedingly low, even if the feed were contaminated.
According to Dr. Bernard Schwetz, FDA's Acting Principal Deputy Commissioner, "The challenge to regulators and industry is to keep this disease out of the United States.
One important defense is to prohibit the use of any ruminant animal materials in feed for other ruminant animals.
Combined with other steps, like U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) ban on the importation of live ruminant animals from affected countries, these steps represent a series of protections, to keep American cattle free of BSE."
Despite this negligible risk, Purina Mills, Inc., is nonetheless announcing that it is voluntarily purchasing all 1,222 of the animals held in Texas and mistakenly fed the animal feed containing the prohibited material.
Therefore, meat from those animals will not enter the human food supply.
FDA believes any cattle that did not consume feed containing the prohibited material are unaffected by this incident, and should be handled in the beef supply clearance process as usual.
FDA believes that Purina Mills has behaved responsibly by first reporting the human error that resulted in the misformulation of the animal feed supplement and then by working closely with State and Federal authorities.
This episode indicates that the multi-layered safeguard system put into place is essential for protecting the food supply and that continued vigilance needs to be taken, by all concerned, to ensure these rules are followed routinely.
FDA will continue working with USDA as well as State and local officials to ensure that companies and individuals comply with all laws and regulations designed to protect the U.S. food supply.
# # # # Texas Feedlot is Ground Zero in BSE Feb 1/01 Reuters By Bob Burgdorfer Floresville, Texas - At the Vaqueros of Texas Cattlefeeders feedlot, huge trucks, according to this story, rumble slowly beside pens containing some 5,000 cattle, placing specially mixed grain rations into troughs.
The story says that the smell of fresh manure hangs in the air as the cattle rush up to eat.
There is not a whiff of the fact that this place has become ground zero in the fight to keep the deadly mad cow disease ravaging Europe out of the United States.
The story explains that last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration quarantined 1,222 head of cattle at Vaqueros because they had accidentally been fed ground-up parts of other ruminant animals, called meat and bone meal.
That ingredient has been banned from being fed back to cattle since 1997 because of fears it transmits mad cow disease.
Ruminant animals are cud-chewers such as cattle and sheep.
The story goes on to explain that Texas has a proud heritage of 19th century cowboys driving lanky longhorn cattle from their home on the range to market at major railroad stops such as the "Wild West" town of Dodge City, Kansas.
At Vaqueros, the head of a longhorn steer complete with horns that span at least 5 feet (1.5 metres), is mounted above a doorway.
Nearby are pictures of Hollywood's most famous cowboy, John Wayne.
The story adds that although efficient, the safety of the modern beef production system has been questioned because of fears that raising so many cattle in such close quarters could help spread disease.
The Vaqueros cattle are fed a blend of corn, rice meal, molasses, byproducts from cotton gins and breweries, and vitamin supplements, Esparza said.
All of the ingredients are produced in Texas, which is another safeguard.
No foreign material, which could possibly bring mad cow here, was used.
An ingredient called premix is about 4 percent of the feed ration.
It was in the premix where the meat and bone meal was accidentally added by Purina Mills, Esparza said.
Purina Mills has said it will discontinue using meat and bone meal in any feed.
France to Begin Screening All Cattle Over 30 Months Old Jan. 1/00 Agence France Presse English/AP/PA News Paris Officials were cited as saying that the French government will from Tuesday begin a major screening programme to test all the country's cattle over 30 months old for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.
Under the programme, 13 French laboratories will conduct a total of some 20,000 tests each week on cattle across the country.
The programme stems from a decision in November by the European Union to order extensive screening of cattle in its 15 member countries to determine the prevalence of BSE among cattle deemed to be most at risk.
At least 153 cases of mad cow disease were discovered in France last year during testing of sick animals, around five times the number detected in 1999.
Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany was quoted as saying in an interview with the French newspaper L'Humanite to be published on Tuesday that since the EU took the decision that all cows over 30 months must be screened for BSE, "it has become extremely difficult to sell animals who have passed that age.
The best way to revive the market is to begin the (screening) process as quickly as possible."
He added screening was "the only way to beat the crisis and to restore the confidence of consumers."
The screening process is likely to add to the consumer cost of beef -- testing will cost 500 francs (76 euros, 72 dollars), of which 100 francs will be paid by the state.
Should an animal test positive, its carcass and by-products would be destroyed.
If the result was later confirmed by the French food safety agency, the entire herd would have to be slaughtered.
Should it test negative, it would be allowed to re-enter the human food chain.
Beijing has issued a ban on imports of European Union meat-and-bone feeds in an effort to prevent mad cow disease spreading to China, according to official press reports.
The move, announced Saturday in an agriculture ministry notice, comes into force today, the China Daily reported.
UK processed meat products containing beef imported from the European Union should present a lower risk to consumers thanks to a new EU-wide testing programme being instituted today.
Professor Peter Smith, the Government's leading adviser on the issue, said the new programme, introduced following BSE cases in France Germany and Spain, will involve tests on all cattle aged over 30 months which are destined for human consumption.
Prof Smith, acting chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, said that the tests would reduce the risk of eating infected beef, but did not guarantee that food was 100% safe.
The European Union renewed its attack on German handling of the mad cow crisis Sunday, with a top official saying the union warned Germany nine months ago that its cattle were probably infected, a newspaper reported.
David Byrne, the group's health and consumer affairs commissioner, told Welt am Sonntag that the European Union sent German Agriculture Minister Karl-Heinz Funke a study in March predicting that German cows were carrying the disease.
Byrne said he was puzzled when Funke continued insisting that German beef was safe, the newspaper said.
Beefing Down? Not in America, Where Mad-Cow Concerns Don't Amount to Much Dec. 31 2000 Denver Rocky Mountain News Debra Melani According to this story, while stories of nvCJD and BSE have alarmed Europe, they seem to be having little effect in Colorado and the rest of the country.
Sara O'Hagan, spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association was quoted as saying, "Our beef demand is up for the first time in 20 years."
Likewise, buyers for Colorado grocers report no slack in sales or any particular concern among customers.
Linda Detwiler, senior staff veterinarian with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in New Jersey was quoted as saying, "There has never been a (mad cow) case in the United States.
We've looked now at about 12,000 (cow) brains with no evidence."
The story explains that U.S. surveillance of cattle began after the disease was first identified in Britain in the late 1980s.
Mad cow disease peaked in that country in 1993, when nearly 1,000 new cases a week were identified.
It has killed or forced the destruction of more than 180,000 head of cattle in Europe.
Early on, the United States halted beef and some feed trade with countries considered high-risk for BSE, Detwiler said.
Later, it extended the ban to include all European countries.
Jim Voss, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, was cited as saying it's unlikely the disease will spread to U.S. cattle and make the jump to humans, adding, "But unlikely isn't a guarantee.
Prion diseases are so new, and they are so difficult to study because there is a very long incubation period."
Jeff Stroh, spokesman for Safeway Food and Drug, was cited as saying that the store surveys customers routinely, adding, "This has in no way showed up on their radar screen."
While Stroh said he couldn't say specifically what the government is doing to keep the beef supply safe, he's confident that it will.
12/26/2000: The below "Import Bulletin" issued today to Import Program Managers.
Pertinent text from FDA's Division of Import Operations and Policy is listed for your information as follows: Import Bulletin 71-B02, "Animal Feed Ingredients From BSE Countries" On December 7, 2000, USDA/APHIS enacted an immediate prohibition on the importation of all meat and bone meal (MBM), meat meal, bone meal, blood meal, tankage, offal or any product containing such, which originates directly from Europe or was rendered/processed in European plants processing animal materials, regardless of species of origin, including poultry and fish meal.
This prohibition was deemed necessary by APHIS because of the possibility of cross contamination with the BSE agent.
Further, on December 14, 2000, APHIS/PPQ/Veterinary Services received information that brokers/importers were beginning to use creative terms to identify shipments of such animal products.
A shipment identified as fertilizer, adhesive, supplement, nutritional supplement, additive, feed/food additive may, in fact, be some type of rendered product for which the entry is prohibited.
APHIS/PPQ personnel were instructed to contact the importer if there are questions concerning the ingredients in the shipment.
Review of OASIS data entries for the above identified products from December 1999 through December 2000 indicated fish meal being exported from Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
Poultry meal shipments were made from Italy and United Kingdom.
Bone meal was shipped from the Netherlands.
Appropriate OASIS screening criteria has been set for all products cited below.
If districts encounter entries of any of these products they should consider the following procedure: 1.
Contact the filer/importer, request paper entry documents, and remind the firm of their obligation to hold the shipment intact pending FDA release; 2.
Request that the filer/importer document the intended use of the product, the ingredients, and the name and address of the ultimate consignee; 3.
If the filer/importer does not agree to hold the product intact pending FDA release, contact the local office of US Customs and ask that they detain the product; 4.
Contact the local office of Plant Protection and Quarantine, USDA and alert them of the entry if they are not already aware of it.
(The location of the local PPQ office can be determined by calling USDA's Veterinary Medical Office at (301) 734-7633); 5.
Contact DIOP for further instructions; 6.
Maintain the product in import status until directed otherwise.

/s/ Joseph L. McCallion Statement of Craig Reed, Administrator, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service December 19, 2000 "As of December 7, 2000, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has prohibited all imports of rendered animal protein products, regardless of species, from Europe.
This decision followed the recent determination by the European Union that feed of non-ruminant origin was potentially cross-contaminated with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent.
The restriction applies to products originating, rendered, processed or otherwise associated with European products.
USDA is taking this emergency action to prevent potentially cross-contaminated products entering the United States.
The same type of rendered product from ruminant origin has been prohibited from BSE infected countries since 1989 and the entirety of Europe since 1997.
"USDA bases all decisions regarding imports on sound science and extensive research.
Although no case of BSE has ever been diagnosed in this country, we continue to take aggressive measures to protect the United States from BSE introduction and to ensure the security of U.S. export markets.
These measures include active surveillance, testing, prevention, education, and emergency preparation.
Since 1989, the United States has banned the import of live ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) and most ruminant products from countries where BSE has been reported.
In 1998, USDA entered into a cooperative agreement with Harvard University's School of Public Health to analyze and evaluate the Department's efforts to prevent BSE.
A report is expected to be issued early next year."
