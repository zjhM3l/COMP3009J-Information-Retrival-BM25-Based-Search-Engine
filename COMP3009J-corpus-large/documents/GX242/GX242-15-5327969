A Message From Dr. Henry Falk, ATSDR Assistant Administrator This Month: Children's Environmental Health Welcome to the first issue of Public Health and the Environment, the newsletter of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).
This inaugural issue of the newsletter, formerly called Hazardous Substances and Public Health, focuses on children's environmental health.
Because their nervous and other organ systems are undergoing rapid development and change, children are uniquely vulnerable to a variety of exposures to hazardous substances from the air, water, and soil.
I hope that you will find this issue helpful in learning more about the growing understanding of the linkages between exposures to toxic substances and disease and developmental disorders in children.
I also hope this issue and future issues in which children will be featured will help readers understand how this expanding science base supports efforts by ATSDR, its partner organizations, state and local health and environmental agencies, and others to protect children from harmful environmental exposures and promote environments in which children can be healthy.
Children's Exposures Children are at higher risk than adults of being exposed to hazardous substances and of suffering adverse health effects as a result of their exposure.
Children's activities put them at higher risk of exposure to hazardous substances that might be in water or soil.
Their height puts them at a level where they are more likely to breathe dust and vapors close to the ground.
Small children often put their hands in their mouths, which can allow contaminants into their bodies.
Children's smaller body size and developing systems also place them at greater health risk than adults.
Because they are smaller, children receive higher doses of toxicants per pound of body weight.
Pound for pound, children drink more water, eat more food, and breathe more air than adults do.
Many organ systems in young children, such as the nervous system and the lungs, undergo rapid growth and development in the first years of life.
During these periods of development, children's organ systems are especially vulnerable to injury.
Of special concern is exposure of the fetus, whose organ Continued on page 2

and body systems are still developing.
Environmental toxicants are a growing cause of preventable illness in children.
Exposure to the following toxicants can cause a variety of health and learning disorders.
Benzene causes leukemia and possibly other cancers.
Environmental tobacco smoke can raise children's risk of ear infections and breathing problems and trigger asthma attacks.
Lead causes learning and behavioral problems.
Mercury can lead to cerebral palsy, severe mental retardation, neurodevelopmental delays, and seizures.
Nitrates and nitrites cause methemoglobinemia (the decreasing capacity of the blood to transport oxygen).
Pesticides can cause cancer, birth defects, and nerve damage.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) might lead to lower intelligence quotients (IQs) in children.
Trichloroethylene (TCE) is associated with hearing loss and delays in speech development.
In addition, environmental triggers of asthma are also a concern.
Environmental pollutants are major contributors to asthma, the most common admission diagnosis in many children's hospitals.
Some of these environmental toxicants are addressed in this issue; others will be discussed in the Children's Environmental Health section in future issues.

ATSDR's Special Emphasis ATSDR has placed special emphasis on children in conducting its health studies and other activities.
The agency has conducted or funded large studies to assess whether the infants of mothers who live near hazardous waste sites are at higher risk for various birth defects or other adverse health outcomes (e.g., small for gestational age).
Some of these studies found an increased risk for neural tube defects.
Several studies also showed an increased risk for musculoskeletal and heart defects.
Since 1998, ATSDR has been producing Toxicological Profiles that highlight the scientific issues relating to children and hazardous wastes.
The profiles now have four sections and two subsections specifically addressing child health issues.
Other sections also include an additional focus on issues relevant to children.
Health care providers treating patients potentially exposed to hazardous substances will find useful information in the Toxicological Profiles; these comprehensive, peerreviewed reference documents are also used by other health professionals, private-sector groups, and members of the public.
The Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) Program The ATSDR PEHSU Program promotes children's health by linking medical specialists who have environmental expertise with pediatricians, parents, and communities.
PEHSU physicians at 11 units in academic medical centers throughout the United States offer community education, training, consultations, and clinical referrals (see PEHSU map on page 6 and listing on pages 6Â­7).
In the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks, the PEHSU in New York City responded in several ways.
PEHSU responses included press interviews; public presentations; and consultation with government agencies, parents, and physicians to answer questions over the telephone and in person.
The PEHSU also provided practical advice, such as practicing prudent avoidance of visible hazards, limiting time outdoors near the World Trade Center site,
limiting outdoor exercise and vigorous play, using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuums or damp mops and rags, cleaning air-handling systems properly, keeping windows closed, and taking shoes off at the door.
The PEHSUs increase access to (a) information, (b) clinical referrals, and (c) training in pediatric environmental health and medicine for physicians and other health care providers.
The PEHSUs link environmental medicine and pediatric specialists to improve environmental health services for children exposed to hazardous substances.
PEHSU Program partners are ATSDR, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its regional offices, and the Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics (AOEC).

Child Health Workgroup The ATSDR Child Health Workgroup is a multidisciplinary panel of experts appointed by ATSDR's Board of Scientific Counselors.
The workgroup makes recommendations to the agency regarding research and policy directions for pediatric environmental health practice.
The most recent Child Health Workgroup meeting in April 2002 addressed children's environmental health response to bioterrorism and diseases, urban sprawl and brownfields, and characteristics of schools located near hazardous waste sites.
The Children's Trust: The Community's Legacy of a Healthy Environment ATSDR is developing a community action plan to help communities deal proactively with children's exposure to toxic substances.
The
ATSDR's Child Health Program (www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ child) emphasizes ongoing focus on relevant child health issues in all of the agency's activities.
action plan will create safe environments for children in communities at risk.
The program will provide a comprehensive framework for communities to understand children's risk for exposure to toxic substances, educate residents of all ages about risks and prevention, and enlist and educate agencies and organizations in these communities to do their part to create safe environments for children.
A key component of the project will be the development of a database of information about educational, policy, and programmatic resources available for community use.
This database will
include products from government, medical, and educational organizations.
The plan will include the roles of and suggested activities for segments of the community that have an impact on environmental health and children, including health care and public health, government, education, media, and business and industry.
This plan will be developed with experts in the field and state and community representatives.
Conclusion ATSDR recognizes that children today face an array of exposures to potentially toxic environmental hazards.
These exposures can have a significant impact on their health and well-being.
Children are at risk for learning disabilities, chronic and acute respiratory diseases, cancers, and illnesses caused by damage to the nervous system from hazardous substances.
The incidences of chronic childhood diseases are increasing.
It is essential that every effort be made to better understand children's unique susceptibilities to environmental hazards.
"In 1998, 7% of children ages 5 to 17 were limited in their activities because of one or more chronic health conditions, compared with 3% of children younger than 5."
Children's Environmental Health: Interagency Collaboration To Promote Children's Health was held in January 2002 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
Attendees included staff from the 11 PEHSUs in the United States, 12 Centers for Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research (see page 8 for more information about the centers), ATSDR, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), EPA, and PEHSUs in Canada and Mexico.
The meeting focused on opportunities for collaboration among and between the centers and the PEHSUs.

ATSDR Chief Medical Officer Dr. Robert Amler is an epidemiologist and emergency room physician.
He has worked in public health for 25 years and at ATSDR for 15 years.
He administers the Child Health Program and heads the Office of Children's Health (OCH), created in 1998.
The office coordinates ATSDR's program activities in children's health.
He says he chose public health because "I believe that public service is the highest calling, and the most important mission in medicine is to protect the health of all people, especially those with the least access to health care."
OCH works closely with the divisions to focus on children's issues.
In the future, OCH plans to examine ways to expand the effectiveness of the PEHSUs, increase the distribution of toxicological reference materials, and work with professional organizations and other federal agencies to develop professional training and practice standards for children's environmental health.
Dr. Amler also practices emergency medicine at Children's Health Care of Atlanta because "I enjoy helping people during emergencies," he says, "and because it keeps me current in the latest techniques and methods in handling medical and surgical emergencies."
Moderate Lead Poisoning: Spotlight on Region 1 PEHSU Three children were referred by their pediatrician to the Region 1 Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) for evaluation and management of moderate lead poisoning.
All three children (2, 3, and 4 years old) had lead levels of 21Â­26 micrograms per deciliter (Âµg/dL) with corresponding elevations in blood concentration of zinc protoporphyrin.
(Elevated blood lead levels are defined as greater than or equal to 10 Âµg/dL.)
The children's mother reported that her home had been completely renovated, and she believed it was lead free.
(The state childhood lead poisoning prevention program inspected the home and found no accessible lead hazards.)
When asked about other potential environmental sources of lead, the mother said that the children often played outside in the home's unfinished driveway.
An environmental inspection of the driveway found that the soil lead concentration was greater than 25,000 parts per million (ppm), far above the 400 ppm considered acceptable by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The mother was later told that the driveway had been used by previous residents for car repair Continued on page 7

that included sanding, painting, and soldering.
Despite the availability of state funds for residential lead abatement, funds were not available to clean up soil.
However, with the PEHSU serving in an advocacy role, funds were secured and the driveway soil was completely cleaned up.
In less than 6 months, the children's blood lead levels dropped to less than 20 Âµg/dL as a result of the combination of abatement, close monitoring, and a brief course of chelation therapy.
"This unusual case showed us that outdoor lead sources are occasionally significant.
We also learned that resources for the abatement of out-of-home lead hazards are insufficient.
Additional infrastructure and support are needed to help families such as this one," said Dr. Michael W. Shannon, MD, MPH, Co-Director of the Pediatric Environmental Health Center.
The Pediatric Environmental Health Center at Children's Hospital Boston is Region 1's PEHSU.
The center offers multidisciplinary consultation, evaluation, and management of children with known or suspected exposure to environmental toxicants.
The center provides medical management for illnesses or intoxications resulting from exposures to heavy metals, indoor air pollutants, outdoor pollutants, and adolescent occupational hazards.
The center coordinates the care of children and adolescents exposed to a wide range of poisons.
In addition to providing clinical services, the staff and affiliated staff are doing research to answer important questions in pediatric environmental health, including How do lead and mercury affect children of different ages? What is the best way to treat children who have lead and mercury poisoning? When should chelation be used? What types of exposures to hazardous substances do adolescents who work have, and how can harmful exposures be prevented? What do other health professionals, such as pediatric primary care providers, need to know about pediatric environmental health? What are the best ways to promote education about pediatric environmental health issues?

Meet Elizabeth (Libby) H. Howze Elizabeth (Libby) H. Howze, ScD, CHES, is the new Director of the Division of Health Education and Promotion at ATSDR in Atlanta, Georgia.
Dr. Howze worked in family planning in the Peace Corps in Sri Lanka during 1967Â­1969.
She graduated from the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1985 with a doctorate in public health education.
Dr. Howze moved to Atlanta in 1994 to serve as Chief of the Health Interventions and Translation Branch in the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Her branch was instrumental in helping redirect public health research and practice in nutrition and physical activity from a focus on individual behavior change to a public health ecologic framework that emphasized policy and environmental change.
As
branch chief--and later as the Associate Director for Health Promotion in the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity at CDC--she provided leadership in the development, release, and dissemination of the first Surgeon General's report on physical activity and health.
Dr. Howze also directed the nutrition and physical activity communications team, one of the first social marketing initiatives at CDC.
About her work as a division director at ATSDR, Dr. Howze says, "I've spent most of my public health career working on the prevention and control of chronic diseases.
Coming to work in environmental health promotion at ATSDR presents a whole new set of challenges for me.
First, how can we most effectively assist communities that have been impacted by hazardous chemicals? And second, what public health actions can be taken to prevent similar harm from occurring to other communities? The growing science base linking environmental exposures to chronic diseases makes the work that ATSDR does all the more important.
I'm excited to be part of it."

Childhood Lead Poisoning in Missouri and Kansas Lead poisoning in children remains a problem in many areas with older homes and poor families.
ATSDR has conducted screening programs to detect lead poisoning in children and provided funds for its state public health partners to develop community screening programs.
A Closer Look Initial lead exposure studies in Jasper County, Missouri (1), and Galena, Kansas (2), led to followup health studies to determine whether blood lead levels in children decreased in response to soil remediation and a health education campaign for the community and health professionals.
ATSDR funded follow-up health studies for these areas through an interagency agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

smelting of lead and zinc ore began in 1850 and continued in the district until the 1970s.
In 1991, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services conducted a health study of people exposed to lead and cadmium and living in areas affected by past mining activities at the Jasper County Superfund site (1).
The study, completed in May 1994, indicated that 14% of children aged 6 to 71 months and living in the study area had blood lead levels 10 micrograms per deciliter (Âµg/dL).
The study also showed that the primary cause of elevated blood lead was exposure to lead-contaminated soils.
Subsequently, EPA released a plan to set priorities for and remediate areas with elevated levels of soil lead.
The plan called for Follow-up study activities include
Galena, Kansas, is in the southeast corner of Cherokee County, Kansas.
The Galena Superfund site is one of six former smelter subsites in Cherokee County.
In the Tri-State area of Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, mining and smelting operations for lead ore recovery began in 1876 and ended in 1979.
Mining and smelting for zinc ore recovery began in the 1890s and ended in the 1960s.
In July 1990, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment conducted a human exposure study of lead and urine cadmium in children between 6 months and 6 years of age living near the Galena, Kansas, Mine Tailings Continued on page 11

Superfund site (2).
The study concluded that children younger than 6 years had higher blood lead levels than did a control group of same-aged children.
Lead levels in six (10.5%) of 57 children in Galena exceeded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lead guideline of 10 Âµg/dL (3).
No children in the control community had elevated blood lead levels (n=128).
Since the initial health study, EPA has completed residential cleanups at 664 properties in Galena, where more than 1,500 properties were tested.
Follow-Up Studies Near the end of the soil remediation activities, ATSDR entered into grants with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services and Kansas Department of Health and Environment to conduct a follow-up health study in each state.
Each study is an EPA initiative and fully funded by EPA.
The goal of the follow-up health studies is to evaluate the effects of major interventions in each area (soil remediation plus an extensive community and professional health education campaign) and determine their effectiveness in reducing the mean blood lead levels of all children, thereby reducing the proportion of children with elevated blood lead levels.
Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services study participants included 215 participants from the original study area and 72 participants from an expanded area.
Participants were children from 6 months to 6 years of age.
Study activities in Missouri include environmental and biologic sampling (completed), soil exposure questionnaires (completed), statistical analysis of all data, and comparison of follow-up study results with those of the initial study.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment study included analysis of blood samples from 100 children between 6 months and 6 years of age, parent or guardian responses to questions about behavioral risk factors associated with blood lead levels, dust wipe samples of window sills and floors from three rooms in each of the 72 houses in the expanded study area, and composite soil samples from the general yard areas, play areas, and drip line of each house.

ATSDR: Public Health Detective ATSDR had to play detective when it undertook the Camp Lejeune survey on birth outcomes in children who were exposed in the womb to trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE).
ATSDR's challenge was to find and survey an estimated 16,500 children who might have been conceived or carried in utero during 1968Â­1985 at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, while their mothers lived in on-base housing at U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Base Camp Lejeune.
Birth certificates were available for 12,493 of these children, but no locating information (such as social security numbers [SSNs]) was listed on the birth certificates.
TCE and PCE contamination was found in the wells used at the onbase housing areas at Camp Lejeune.
The sources of these contaminants were improper chemical disposal at an on-base motor pool area and an off-base dry-cleaning business.
The contamination was discovered during routine tap water sampling, as required for compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.
No drinking water standards existed for TCE and PCE until 1991 (see box).
Early exposure to these contaminants in drinking water has been associated with hearing loss, delays in speech development, and impaired fetal development.
Challenges Faced in This Survey We sought women who conceived or were pregnant when they lived on the base between 17 and 34 years ago (1968Â­1985), as well as the children of those women.
Most of these women or their spouses had already left the USMC, and the women's last names could now be different.
Many of the children are now adults; some of them could now be deceased.
Initially, we were unable to use files or databases managed under the Department of Defense (DOD) because of concerns about protection of privacy.
TCE and PCE are solvents that were used as degreasers and as dry cleaning agents.
TCE and PCE levels were 1,400 parts per billion (ppb) and 215 ppb, respectively, at the tap.
The maximum contaminant level (MCL) (passed in 1991) for both TCE and PCE is 5 ppb. MCLs are standards used to define levels above which water is unsafe for drinking.
Successes In medical files at the Camp Lejeune Naval Hospital, we found contact information for almost onethird of the 12,493 children for whom we had birth certificates.
Additional information was found by reviewing old birth announcements from files of the local newspaper (the Jacksonville Daily News).
In addition, the DOD privacy officer agreed that the USMC could try to match names from the 12,493 birth certificates with the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC).
A USMC staff person was assigned to find databases within the USMC system that could help ATSDR.
If a database was found, USMC personnel searched it for ATSDR to see if it contained current addresses, telephone numbers, or SSN information for those persons who had not yet completed the Continued on page 13

telephone survey.
Only exact matches were released to ATSDR.
Much information was obtained through this process, and it has been extremely helpful.
What Has Our Investigation Revealed to Date? The data collection phase of the survey ended on January 26, 2002; 12,598 surveys were completed.
A summary report will be available in fall 2002.
The report will give the rates of birth defects and childhood cancers in children who participated in the project.
If the rates in children conceived or carried at Camp Lejeune are elevated compared with the national rates for these same conditions, further study will attempt to determine potential factors that might have attributed to these increased rates.--MARIE L. SOCHA, DRPH, MS, MSPH
The National Children's Study In 1998, the Developmental Disabilities Work Group of the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children recommended the commission of a longitudinal cohort study of environmental impacts on children.
The purpose of the study is to identify subtle, but important, effects of low-level environmental exposures, as well as other biological and social factors on children's health.
In addition, the study will become a valuable resource to answer other questions of scientific interest.
Under the auspices of the task force, several federal agencies, including ATSDR, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the National Center for Environmental Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have

Case Studies in Environmental Medicine Case Studies in Environmental Medicine: Pediatric Environmental Health is ATSDR's newest case study.
It has been accredited and will soon be online on the case study home page (www.atsdr.cdc.
gov/HEC/CSEM).
Continuing medical education (CME) credits, continuing nursing education (CNE) credits, continuing health education specialist (CHES) credits, and continuing education unit (CEU) credits are available.
Following is an excerpt from the case study.
A mother brings her 2Â½-year-old son to you for consultation.
She explains that her family moved to your community about 7 months ago when her husband changed jobs.
Over the past month and a half, the boy has developed progressive loss of appetite and weight loss.
He has also suffered from an increasingly severe and itchy rash.
Although usually very active and pleasant, he has become ill-tempered and, for the past couple of days, he refuses to walk around, preferring to lie in bed or be carried.
He rubs his knees and cries periodically throughout the day.
Neither the parents nor the child's grandmother, who lives with them, has been ill.
The boy's medical history has been unremarkable.
His height and weight have been consistently in the
After completion of this educational activity, the reader should be able to describe how and why children differ from adults in their susceptibility to environmental hazards, incorporate knowledge of environmental medicine in the evaluation of well and sick children, consider parental occupation and hobbies as a part of the environmental history, and identify additional sources of environmental health information.
25th percentile for his age.
He is on a regular toddler diet, and all developmental milestones have been appropriately met.
He is not taking any medications.
The mother denies any family use of dietary supplements or herbal medicines.
The family history is negative for blood transfusions and use of illicit drugs, human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection, and metabolic or genetic diseases.
A review of systems and a brief assessment of how the family functions are negative.
No one in the family has been traveling in a foreign country.
During the day, the child stays at home with his mother or grandmother.
The mother works parttime as a bookkeeper-clerk in a local dry-cleaning facility.
The father works as a production manager in a thermometer factory.
The mother states that both parents are concerned about environmental contaminants, specifically those that might be associated with their workplaces, and whether or not
these contaminants can put their family at risk.
The parents have heard neighbors' and co-workers' comments about ailments associated with mercury exposures.
The parents also mention reports of teenagers in the community taking mercury from the local high school chemistry lab over the past several months.
These incidents resulted in an ongoing investigation by the environmental division of the state health department.

on or within 1 mile of two or more NPL sites.
Many of these 55,956 students were very young children--more than one-third were in prekindergarten through third grade.
Proportionately more minority and poor children attended these schools than would be expected.
This initial analysis suggests that, across the country, a substantial number of students attend schools near or built on top of an NPL site.
However, proximity is not equivalent to exposure.
A schoolspecific exposure assessment must be done to determine whether any chemical hazards from nearby NPL sites have affected the school population (see pilot exposure assessment section).--ROBIN WAGNER, PHD, MS Pilot Exposure Assessment of Schools Sited On or Near Hazardous Waste Sites in Brownfields Communities Because it is possible that site conditions or the availability of information on exposures might have changed since the date of release of a public health assessment (PHA) on a National Priorities List (NPL) site, ATSDR initiated a pilot field project in summer/fall 2001 to evaluate whether specific exposure pathways exist for school populations near these sites.
ATSDR selected a subset of NPL sites in the United States for follow-up Continued on page 18
1,550 National Priorities List (NPL) or Superfund hazardous waste sites in the United States.
In an initial analysis using 1999 school data, we found that 438 schools were built on or within 1 mile of 61 NPL sites in 16 brownfields showcase communities designated by EPA.
One hundred thirty-eight of these schools (with a total enrollment of more than 92,000 students) had been built directly on an NPL site.
Seventy-six percent of these onsite schools were built above contaminated groundwater plumes.
Because of remediation efforts, none of the schools above the plumes are currently exposed to contaminated groundwater.
An additional 189,366 children attended schools within 1 mile of an NPL site.
Although most of these students attended schools that were close to only one NPL site, one-fifth of the children (N=55,956) attended schools built
School Locations Characteristics of Schools Sited On or Near Hazardous Waste Sites in Brownfields Communities Healthy schools are an essential part of healthy communities.
The physical location and siting of schools are important issues in many communities, especially in population-dense areas in the Northeast and in major cities where land for schools is scarce.
ATSDR is using geographic information systems (GIS), a spatial analysis approach, to estimate the number and sociodemographic characteristics of public and private elementary and secondary schools located on or near the approximately

The sites selected were in Florida, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington.
More than 50 schools are located on or within 1 mile of these 13 sites.
Findings from this pilot study indicate that no current pathways of exposure exist for schoolchildren in relation to the sites evaluated.
We found that any school-related exposure concerns are being addressed by the PHA process, which includes a review of new environmental data and pathway issues by ATSDR and our state partners.
We also found that a
Key findings of the field project No current pathways of exposure exist for schoolchildren in relation to the sites evaluated.
A 1-mile radius may be too far away to assess potential exposure pathways associated with a given site.
This is particularly true for older, inactive NPL sites.
Public health assessment (PHA) categories Indeterminate public health hazard: Term used in a PHA when a professional judgment on the level of health hazard cannot be made because information critical to such a decision is lacking.
Public health hazard: Term used in a PHA for sites that pose a public health hazard because of long-term exposures (longer than 1 year) to sufficiently high levels of hazardous substances that could result in harmful health effects.
1-mile radius seems to be too far away to assess potential exposure pathways related to a given site.
ATSDR should continue to prepare geographic information system (GIS) databases related to NPL site boundaries and school locations.
The school location data, based on Department of Education databases, will be useful to ATSDR and state partners as new
sites are identified.
A careful review of the site-specific environmental data is needed before any public health conclusions can be made on (a) the presence of exposures to school populations and (b) further evaluation of any potential adverse health effects related to the population.--LESLIE C. CAMPBELL, MS

The Impact of ADHD May Be Underestimated The public health impact of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be greatly underestimated by school and public health officials, say scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).
In a recently published study, the NIEHS scientists and their colleagues at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill reported that when they queried parents in a "typical" county of rural and suburban homes (Johnston County, North Carolina), the parents reported more than 15% of boys in grades one through five had been diagnosed with ADHD and about 10% (or two-thirds of those diagnosed) were taking medication for the condition.
Asking the parents was a key to the higher figures, the researchers thought, because school nurses might not be aware of children who were receiving medication treatment entirely at home.
"Treatment rates are usually viewed as abnormally high if they exceed the 3% to 5% prevalence estimate for ADHD cited in an American Psychiatric Association manual in 1994," the authors said.
"Therefore, the national public health impact of ADHD may be
greatly underestimated by both educators and public health officials."
The study used parental and teacher reports of 6,099 children in 17 public elementary schools in the semirural county.
Because Johnston County has a racial/ethnic and educational profile similar to North Carolina as a whole, the authors of the study said they thought that medication treatment rates are probably similar in many other counties in North Carolina and elsewhere.
The researchers said similar data need to be collected nationally to better understand ADHD medication treatment patterns.
The research appears online in the February issue of the American Journal of Public Health, a publication of the American Public Health Association.
The journal is accessible at www.apha.org.

A Pledge to Protect Children The Bangkok Statement More than 300 participants from 35 countries attended the World Health Organization's international conference on "Environmental Threats to the Health of Children" in Bangkok on March 3Â­7, 2002.
A full report of the meeting can be requested from Dr. Peter Van den Hazel (P.J.van.den.Hazel@ inter.NL.net).
At the meeting, participants pledged to promote the protection of children's environmental health.
An excerpt from the Pledge To Promote the Protection of Children's Environmental Health follows: "We affirm That the principle `children are not little adults' requires full recognition and a preventive approach.
Children are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of chemical, biological, and physical agents.
Every child should be protected from injury, poisoning, and hazards in the different environments where they are born, live, learn, play, develop, and grow to become the adults of tomorrow and citizens in their own right.
That every child with no exception should have the right to safe, clean, and supportive environments that ensure his/ her survival, growth, development, healthy life, and well being.
The recognition of this right is especially important as the world moves forward towards adopting sustainable development practices.
That it is the responsibility of professionals, community workers, local and national authorities and policy-makers, and organizations dealing with health, environment, and education issues to ensure that actions are initiated, developed, and sustained in all countries to promote the recognition, assessment, and mitigation of physical, chemical, and biological hazards that threaten children's health and quality of life."
