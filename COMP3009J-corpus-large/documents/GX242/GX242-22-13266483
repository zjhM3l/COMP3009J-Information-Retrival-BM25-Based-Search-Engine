The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) recently issued a general permit to address discharges from swimming pools and spas.
"This permit authorizes the discharge of pool or spa overflows, drainage, cleaning wastewater and filter backwash," said Robert Summers, director of MDE's Water Management Administration.
"These effluents often have the potential to cause localized problems in the receiving waters.
The permit requires quality control of wastewater by the best available treatment or pollution prevention technology."
Pool owners are required to obtain permits for discharges from all "public" pools (including private marinas) to surface water, ground water or storm sewers.
Pool owners discharging only to sanitary sewers are not required to register under this permit.
They must receive permission to discharge from the operator of the sanitary sewer and meet any conditions that operator imposes, however.
Pool owners must submit a Notice of Intent to MDE along with the required filing fee of $100.

UNDERW SUMMER 2002 Maryland Clean Marinas AY "Bay Game" Promotes Clean Boating Every year, 300,000 Maryland Bay Games are distributed to motorists traveling over the William Preston Lane, Jr.
Memorial Bridge (Bay Bridge) on their way to the ocean.
Designed for children ages 3 and up, the Bay Game helps increase awareness of how our surroundings relate to the Chesapeake Bay.
The 24 page booklet chronicles the adventures of two water droplets as they travel through the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
The booklet includes a word search, crossword puzzle, math quiz, secret code message, a stump-the-grownups game, and a full page of color stickers.
It also encourages children to locate 14 sites which are marked with "Bay Game Site" highway signs on the way to the beach.
One of these signs overlooks Lippincott Marine in Grasonville.
The corresponding text in the Maryland Bay Game describes how certified Clean Marinas safeguard Maryland's air and water and help boaters do the same.
For example, "One partner in protection, Lippincott Marine, uses vacuum sanders to remove paint from boat bottoms, keeping toxic dust off the ground and out of the Bay."
The text further encourages kids and their parents to follow clean boating tips and directs them to DNR's web site for a complete list of certified Clean Marinas.
Requests for copies of the Bay Game should be sent to mdbaygameorder@dnr.state.md.us or to: A.V. Grant, Bay Game Manager Maryland Department of Natural Resources 580 Taylor Ave., D4 Annapolis, MD 21401 Please include your organization's name, mailing address, phone number and the number of games requested.
BMP Spotlight: Environmental Precautions at the Fuel Dock The height of the boating season is here and with it is the potential for accidental spills at fuel docks.
While most spills are smalla matter of ouncesthe cumulative result can be devastating .
A recent report from the National Research Council indicates that toxic compounds found in petroleum may have adverse effects on marine species even at very low concentrations.* To protect our waterways and to help your customers avoid hefty fines, follow these guidelines for environmentallyresponsible fuel dock operations: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Always have a trained employee at the fuel dock to oversee fueling .
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ask the employee to clarify the product the customer has asked for.
For example, "Here is gasoline, Captain.
You asked for gasoline."
Also, ask the employee to note that the customer is using the proper intake: not the access port to the holding tank or a fishing rod holder! Ã¯Â¿Â½ Have the employee hand each customer an oil absorbent pad and/or a no-spill jug to capture backsplash and vent line overflow.
Keep separate pads for diesel and gasoline.
Store them in plastic buckets at the fuel dock.
Once diesel pads are saturated, double bag them and place in your regular trash.
Allow gasoline pads to air dry and reuse indefinitely.
Fuel captured in a no-spill jug can be offered to the next customer or used in marina equipment such as lawn mowers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Remove holding clips from fuel nozzles.
They are illegal at marina fuel docks (COMAR 26.10.01.20E and 26.10.03.07).
Also, remind boaters that soda cans or other devices may not be used to hold nozzles open.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Instruct fuel dock personnel and boaters to listen to fill pipes to anticipate when tanks are nearly full.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Instruct boaters to slow down at the beginning and end of fueling .
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage boaters to fill their tanks just before leaving on a trip to reduce spillage due to thermal expansion and rocking , i.e., if fuel is used before it warms up, it cannot spill overboard.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ If boaters prefer to refuel upon their return to port, encourage them to fill their tanks to no more than 90 percent of capacity.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Suggest to customers who routinely vent fuel overboard that they install fuel/air separators along their vent lines to prevent such overflows.

Your Input Needed on State Boating Expenditures 2 Funding Available to control SAV at Public Facilities 2 Congressional Staffers Tour Shipwright Harbor Marina 2 Three New Clean Marinas 3 New Flags Accentuate Clean Marinas 3 New Pool Permit Affects Marinas 4 1 I NPUT N EEDED ON W ATERWAY I MPROVEMENT F UND F INANCIAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO CONTROL NUISANCE The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is undertaking a study to 1) assess the condition and use of existing boating infrastructure, e.g ., ramps, marinas, channels, 2) assess environmental and other constraints on new development, and 3) recommend procedures for linking funding decisions to identified needs while being mindful of environmental constraints and linkages to broad policy goals such as the Chesapeake Bay Agreement.
The first stage of the study is a survey of public and private marina and boat launch operators.
The surveys will be mailed in mid-June.
Later in the summer, 1,500 registered boaters will be surveyed to gather information about their boating habits and their perceptions of where infrastructure needs to be improved or, conversely, pristine areas that should not be developed.
Ultimately, the results will be used to refine how Waterway Improvement Funds (WIF) are distributed.
The WIF was established in 1966 to benefit the general boating public by funding projects to improve and promote recreational and commercial capabilities, conditions, and safety of Maryland's waterways.
Revenues for the fund are obtained primarily from the one time excise tax that is paid to the State when a boat is purchased and titled in the State.
The fund also receives a small percentage of the state motor fuel tax.
Depending upon Congressional reauthorization of the Boating Infrastructure Grant program, the study results will also guide allocation of Maryland's share of these federal funds.
Every boating facility operator in Maryland should receive a copy of the survey.
The time it takes to complete the survey will be well worth the effort.
Don't miss this opportunity to help define State policy with regard to publicly-funded waterway improvements.

SAV AT PUBLIC FACILITIES Three New Certified Clean facilities have Marinas Three In many tidal areas of the Chesapeake Bay, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) populations are increasing .
As distribution grows, conflicts between boaters and nuisance aquatic plants can be expected to increase.
In areas where SAV is abundant, boat ramps can become clogged with plants to the point where it is difficult or even impossible to reach open water from launching and docking areas.
Navigational impediments have been a persistent problem in the Potomac River since hydrilla appeared in the early 1980s, which resulted in the formation of the MD/VA/DC Council of Governments Hydrilla Control Program.
As hydrilla continues to spread throughout the Chesapeake, the group anticipates user conflicts on a broader scale.
To minimize conflicts and maintain open channels, the Department of Natural Resources plans to establish a mechanism for control of nuisance aquatic plants throughout the tidal waters of Maryland wherever water access from public facilities is restricted.
Efforts will seek both to open channels from point-to-point and to completely eradicate species at low abundance that pose great threats (e.g ., water chestnut).
For the summer of 2002, DNR has set up a program to provide financial assistance to public boating facilities that experience problems with water access due to SAV growth.
This summer, a permitting system will be established similar to what exists for dredging projects, wherein public facility operators will submit written requests to the Department for SAV control.
Control efforts will involve physically cutting SAV beds above the sediment and removing plant materials to an off-site location.
To better anticipate the scale of problems to be expected this summer, anyone who has had problems in the past is asked to call or e-mail Mike Naylor of MD DNR at mnaylor@dnr.state.md.us or 410-260-8652.
more familiar with how NOAA funds are used in states' Coastal Programs (the Clean Marina Initiative is part of Maryland's Coastal Program).
Other stops included a discussion of sea level rise and shore erosion issues in Shadyside and SAV planting in the Patuxent River.
The tour was designed to stress the importance of continued NOAA funding to state Coastal Programs and to try to redress a cap on current funding levels.

The newest additions to the list of premier marinas in Maryland are Bay Boat Works in North East, Gratitude Marina in Rock Hall, and Skipjack Landing Marine Center in Chester.
"Everybody, staff and customers, worked so hard to achieve this award," said Bay Boat Works vice president Mary Green.
"We are so proud that an older facility like ours has been recognized for upholding high environmental standards related to our operations which include vessel maintenance, a fuel dock, a sewage pumpout system, slip rentals, and winter storage."
Ms. Green runs the marina along with her husband Donald Green whose grandfather started the business in 1928.
The marina is located on 31.7 acres of property, more than 20 acres of which is undeveloped marsh land.
The facility Don and Mary Green, Bay Boat is distinguished by a collection of outbuildings that span the marina's history.
For instance, the carpentry Works, with their Clean Marina shop was used to build munition boxes during World War II.
Award.
Gratitude Marina is a working boat yard with 80 wet slips and room to store 225 boats on land in the winter.
While marina staff use the usual precautions of vacuum sanders and tenting vessels that are to be sand- or soda-blasted, general manager Jon Wright insists that educating customers to use pollution prevention measures can have a large impact on the quality of Bay waters as well.
"Boatyards can lead by example, setting good practices for customers to see and imitate.
In this way, we can all help to reverse the effects of past practices that put the Bay in jeopardy."
Skipjack Landing Marine Center is a working boat yard with about 60 slips and an emphasis on engine repair and maintenance.
Owner Ralph Kirchner collects and recycles used oil, John Diver (L) and Jon Wright (R), Gratitude antifreeze and gasoline.
Additionally, all used solvents are collected by a hazardous waste Marina, with their Clean Marina Award. hauler.
"We protect our waterways by maintaining a neat shop," said Mr. Kirchner.
His wife, Karen Kirchner, added, "We also require customers who perform their own vessel maintenance to abide by our pollution prevention policies.
For instance, any hull sanding must be conducted over filter fabric or with a vacuum sander."
There are now a total of 41 certified Clean Marinas in Maryland and 8 Clean Marina Partners.
An additional 97 facilities have pledged to meet the Clean Marina criteria.
As reported in the last issue of Under way , Mark and Kim Kahan, Fairview Marina, recently earned the Clean Marina Award.
Clean Marinas now enjoy even greater visibility.
Each certified Clean Marina has been presented with a 3' x 5' flag in the State colors emblazoned with the Clean Marina logo and the slogan, "Partners in Protection" (see picture on page 4 of this newsletter).
The eye-catching flags make it easier for boaters to identify certified Clean Marinas.
Certified facility operators may order additional flags for $37 each by sending a check made out to the Department of Natural Resources to the Clean Marina office.
NEW FLAGS A CCENTUATE CERTIFIED CLEAN MARINAS Congressional Staffers Tour Shipwright Harbor Marina John Meneely, owner of Shipwright Harbor Marina in Deale, led a tour of his certified Clean Marina for federal representatives on May 29, 2002.
The group included staff from the Coastal States Organization and the offices of U.S. Congressional Representatives Loretta Sanches (D -CA), Frank Pallone (D-NJ), and Sam Farr (D - CA).
Mr. Meneely highlighted pollution prevention measures, including a grant-funded wash water recycling system and oil and antifreeze recycling tanks.
Managers of neighboring Clean Marinas, Herrington Harbor North and Rockhold Creek Marina, also joined the tour to offer their impressions of the Clean Marina Initiative and their customers' positive reactions to this voluntary program to protect Maryland's waterways.
The stop at Shipwright Harbor was part of a day-long tour for members of the "U.S. Coastal Caucus," NOAA appropriations subcommittee, and natural resources subcommittee to become C Ã¯Â¿Â½ Post signs summarizing your fuel dock rules.
A sign will lend credibility to the dock hand who is trying , for example, to get a reluctant boater to use an oil absorbent pad.
A sign allows a dock hand to respectfully and authoritatively request that the customer follow the marina rules.
