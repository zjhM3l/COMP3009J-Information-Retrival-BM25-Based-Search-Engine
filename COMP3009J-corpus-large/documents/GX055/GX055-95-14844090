About your treatment
Your doctor has ordered the drug filgrastim to help treat your illness.
The drug will be infused into a vein or injected under your skin.
This medication is used to: * decrease the chance of infection in patients with nonmyeloid cancers who receive anticancer therapy that lowers white blood cell counts.
* reduce the amount of time the white blood cell counts are low and prevent the consequences of low white blood cell counts in patients with nonmyeloid cancer who receive chemotherapy that destroys bone marrow in preparation for bone marrow transplant.
* mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells into peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis. * decrease the chance and the duration of problems due to low white blood cell counts in patients with congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia (low white blood cell counts).
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
Filgrastim is in a class of drugs known as growth factors; it promotes the growth of white blood cells which help to fight infections.
The length of treatment depends on the types of drugs you are taking, how well your body responds to them, and the type of cancer you have.
Other uses for this medicine
Filgrastim also is used to increase white blood cell counts in adults with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and to treat low white blood cell counts in adults with acute leukemia who have received chemotherapy.
In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, filgrastim is used to increase white blood cell counts or to prevent the further lowering of white blood cell counts due to the virus and/or to medication.
Filgrastim has been used to increase white blood cell counts in people who do not have cancer but take medications that lower white blood cell counts.
