Osceola was one of the leaders of the Seminole Indians during the Second Seminole War with the United States in the 1830s.
Although originally from Alabama, Osceola and his Creek Indian mother moved to Florida, which was the homeland of the Seminole Indians.
When white settlers began moving into the state, they wanted the Seminoles to move to Indian territories west of the Mississippi River.
Osceola led a group of Seminoles opposed to relocation.
Other Seminoles, however, chose to move rather than fight.
By using tactics unfamiliar to the white settlers and by hiding in the Everglades, Osceola and some of the Seminoles were successfully able to resist the United States government's attempts to remove them from Florida for a time.
It was not until the capture of Osceola and his death in 1838 at Fort Moultrie in South Carolina that the Seminoles were forced from their homeland
