The job of reconstructing Afghanistan and thereby creating an environment that allows Afghan women to participate fully in the political, economic and social life of liberated Afghanistan is far from over, but the 2003 Report to Congress shows that progress is well underway and that life is better now than it was a year ago for many Afghans.

The task force report argues that to prevent a return to anarchy, Washington needs to bolster the Karzai government's ability to bring security and economic hope to the people of Afghanistan.
The report makes three principal recommendations to achieve these goals: 1) Improve security by extending peacekeeping efforts beyond Kabul and accelerating development of the Afghan National Army (ANA); 2) Increase pressure on neighboring countries not to undercut the Karzai government by backing warlords or failing to curb pro-Taliban remnants; and 3) Provide at least $1 billion in reconstruction assistance for each of the next five years.

According to Human Rights Watch, this report provides evidence that combatants in the Ituri region of northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have slaughtered some five thousand civilians in the last year because of their ethnic affiliation.
But the combatants are armed and often directed by the governments of the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda.
A number of treaties and ceasefires, the most recent signed in Burundi on June 19, have supposedly ended the conflict between the governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and the DRC, as well as Congolese rebel movements set to share power with the Kinshasa government.

THE AFRICA MALARIA REPORT 2003
Source: World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, April 25, 2003 Non-USG Publication
This report - the first of its kind - takes stock of the malaria situation and of continuing efforts to tackle the disease in Africa; it is based on a review of the best information available to WHO and UNICEF, from sample surveys and routine reports, at the end of 2002.
Malaria continues to be a major impediment to health in Africa south of the Sahara, where it frequently takes its greatest toll on very young children and pregnant women.
Because malaria is such a common disease and well known to the people it affects most, and because many of those who become sick with malaria do not visit health care facilities, assessing the size of the problem, and how it is changing over time, is an enormous challenge.
New analyses confirm that malaria is a principal cause of at least one-fifth of all young child deaths in Africa.
The latest available data on outpatient visits and on hospital admissions and deaths due to malaria confirm that this disease makes substantial demands on Africa's fragile health infrastructure.
In endemic countries, as many as one-third of all clinic visits and at least a quarter of all hospital admissions are for malaria.
In some countries, these data suggest that illness due to malaria has increased over the past decade; in others, the size of the problem has remained constant.
No country in Africa south of the Sahara for which data are available shows a substantial decline.

Arms Control/Non-Proliferation
PREVENTING THE MISUSE OF PATHOGENS: THE NEED FOR GLOBAL BIOSECURITY STANDARDS
Source: Arms Control Association, Jonathan B. Tucker, June 2003 Non-USG Publication
Negotiating global standards that restrict access to dangerous pathogens would reduce the threat of bioterrorism, while reinforcing the legal prohibitions on the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons contained in the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).
Since its inception, the credibility of the BWC has been undermined by its lack of formal mechanisms for monitoring and verification, and efforts over the past decade to strengthen the treaty have been largely unsuccessful.
Since international terrorist organizations are likely to seek biowarfare materials from the most accessible source, international biosecurity standards would reduce the risk that terrorists could obtain dangerous pathogens from foreign laboratories and culture collections.
Harmonized guidelines for transferring pathogens would also facilitate collaborative research and development on biodefense vaccines and drugs.
Joint U.S.-Russian research projects on defenses against anthrax and smallpox, for example, have been hampered by incompatible national regulations on the export of dangerous pathogens.

Despite some convergence of positions within the allied camp, significant differences remain, limiting the effectiveness of policies adopted by each.
Washington favors a policy of isolation while Seoul pursues one of engagement.
American friends and allies in the region part ways with the United States over how to manage the nuclear crisis and ultimately induce change in the North.
Regional partners fear that the United States will attack North Korean nuclear facilities and unleash war on the peninsula.
All of these states, particularly South Korea and China, tend to oppose anything resembling comprehensive sanctions for fear that an embargo would lead to war as North Korea has threatened.

Why has the United States taken two different approaches to thwarting the weapons programs of Iraq and North Korea? What military optionsif anydoes the United States have in North Korea?

North Koreas Nuclear Weapons Program
Source:CRS Report for Congress, Larry A. Niksch, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, updated Jan. 7, 2003 USG: Official Publications
"North Koreas decision in December 2002 to restart nuclear installations at Yongbyon that were shut down under the U.S.- North Korean Agreed Framework of 1994 creates an acute foreign policy problem for the United States.
North Koreas major motive appears to be to escalate pressure on the Bush Administration to negotiate over Pyongyangs proposed non-aggression pact and/or a new nuclear agreement that would provide new U.S. benefits to North Korea.
However, restarting the Yongbyon facilities opens up a possible North Korean intent to stage a nuclear breakout of its nuclear program and openly produce nuclear weapons within six months.
North Koreas actions follow the disclosure in October 2002 that North Korea is operating a secret nuclear program based on uranium enrichment and the decision by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in November 2002 to suspend shipments of heavy oil to North Korea."
Options for Dealing with North Korea

"Various options have been presented for how the U.S. might deal with the threat of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
According to the author, Washington should consider another approach.
It should inform North Korea that, unless it abandons its nuclear program, the United States will encourage South Korea and Japan to make their own decisions about also going nuclear.
That prospect might well cause the North to reconsider and keep the region nonnuclear.
Even if it does not do so, a nuclear balance of power in northeast Asia might emerge instead of a North Korean nuclear monopoly."

This fact sheet is, in fact, a hypertexted goldmine of information on federal and state legislative activity on genetically modified organisms and other aspects of agricultural biotechnology.
It reveals that states continue to be active in addressing emerging issues raised by agricultural biotechnology.
During the 2001-2002 legislative session, 158 pieces of legislation related to agricultural biotechnology were introduced in 39 states.
Twenty-eight percent of introduced legislation addressed concerns about violent protest against agricultural biotechnology; eighteen percent of introduced legislation addressed rights and responsibilities of farmers and biotech seed producers by establishing liability for damages caused by misuse of genetically modified (GM) crops or by regulating agricultural contracts.
There is also a related Legislation Tracker database at: http://pewagbiotech.org/resources/factsheets/legislation, which is quite useful and easy to use.

Chinas efforts to accomplish its security goals involve an integrated strategy that seeks to apply diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of national power.
Chinas leaders believe that national unity and stability are critical if China is to survive and develop as a nation.
Chinese leaders also believe they must maintain conditions of state sovereignty and territorial integrity.
While seeing opportunity and benefit in interactions with the United States -- primarily in terms of trade and technology -- Beijing apparently believes that the United States poses a significant long-term challenge.

This report examines options for designing a domestic greenhouse gas reduction program.
In addition to cap-and-trade programs, this report evaluates greenhouse gas taxes and a sectoral hybrid program that combines efficiency standards for automobiles and consumer products with a cap-and-trade program applicable to large sources of greenhouse gases.
Each option is evaluated according to the following criteria: environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, administrative feasibility, distributional equity, and political acceptability.
The reports analysis suggests that the comprehensive, upstream cap-and-trade (or similar) approach and the sectoral hybrid approach are the most viable alternatives for a domestic program.
EMISSIONS TRADING IN THE U.S.: EXPERIENCE, LESSONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR GREENHOUSE GASES (zipped version)
Source: Pew Center on Global Climate Change, A. Denny Ellerman, Paul L. Joskow and David Harrison, Jr., May 15, 2003 Non-USG Publication
In recent years, emissions trading has become an important element of programs to control air pollution.
Experience indicates that an emissions trading program, if designed and implemented effectively, can achieve environmental goals faster and at lower costs than traditional command-and-control alternatives.
Under such a program, emissions are capped but sources have the flexibility to find and apply the lowest-cost methods for reducing pollution.
A cap-and-trade program is especially attractive for controlling global pollutants such as greenhouse gases because their warming effects are the same regardless of where they are emitted, the costs of reducing emissions vary widely by source, and the cap ensures that the environmental goal is attained.
Emissions trading has achieved prominence beyond the United States largely in the context of discussions regarding implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, a proposed international agreement to control emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases.
The Kyoto Protocol provides for the use of various emissions trading mechanisms at the international level.
Some countries already are developing emissions trading programs while the process of ratifying the Protocol moves forward.
Both the United Kingdom and Denmark have instituted greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading programs, and, in December 2002, the European environment ministers agreed on the ground rules for a European Union trading program that would begin in 2005 for large sources of CO2 emissions (and later for other GHG emissions).
Proposals to control GHG emissions in the United States also include the use of emissions trading.

The Pew Center report, Forests and Global Climate Change: Potential Impacts on U.S. Forest Resources, explores the challenges climate change will pose to forest ecosystems and related economic enterprises over the next century.
One-third of U.S. lands are covered by forests, making forest ecosystems one of the nations most prominent natural resources.
In addition to their contribution to biodiversity, water quality, and recreation, forests also play a significant role in the U.S. economy, and forestry or forestry-related enterprises are the dominant industries in many U.S. communities.
According to a new study by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, the U.S. forestry sector will face a number of challenges in the next century due to the impacts of climate change.

A CATALOGUE OF FAILURES: G8 ARMS EXPORTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
Source: Amnesty International, May 19, 2003 Non-USG Publication
At least two thirds of all global arms transfers in the years 1997-2001 came from five members of the G8.
The top supplier of weapons to the world was the United States, accounting for 28 per cent of global arms transfers.
Second in line was Russia, with seventeen per cent.
Third was France at 10 per cent, followed by Britain at 7 per cent and then Germany with 5 per cent.
For 25 years, US law has stipulated that weapons should be kept out of the hands of governments that will use them to abuse human rights.
Yet US commercial arms sales have frequently had the opposite effect.
US arms sales directed to developing countries have quadrupled from 2000 to 2001, many of them with forces that persistently abuse human rights.
In addition, US military aid is currently furnished to more than 30 countries identified by the US itself as having a "poor" human rights record, or worse.
Almost ten years ago, the USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United Kingdom (UK) signed up, with other participating states of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), to the Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers.
These Principles commit participating states to "avoid transfers which would be likely to be used for the violation or suppression of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
However, an examination of the practices of these seven powerful states falls short of their agreed benchmark.

Addressing poverty requires understanding its causes.
This Report adds to that understanding by analyzing the root causes of failed development.
During the 1990s debates about development focused on three sets of issues.
The first was the need for economic reforms to establish macroeconomic stability.
The second was the need for strong institutions and governanceto enforce the rule of law and control corruption.
The third was the need for social justice and involving people in decisions that affect them and their communities and countriesan issue that this Report continues to champion.
These issues are all crucial for sustainable human development, and they continue to deserve priority attention in policy-making.
But they overlook a fourth factor, explored here: the structural constraints that impede economic growth and human development.
The Millennium Development Compact presented in this Report proposes a policy approach to achieving the Millennium Development Goals that starts by addressing these constraints.

Among the nearly 3 billion people living on less than USD$2 a day, the report says some 1 billion - or about 23 per cent of the developing world's population - struggle along on USD$1 a day or less.
Regionally, poverty trends vary.
On the positive side, declining poverty in China and other East Asian countries in the 1990s significantly reduced the number of persons living on very low incomes, from 1.1 billion to about 900 million.
In South Asia, the number of people living in poverty remains more or less stable at about 1.1 billion, although population growth now makes this a smaller share of the population.
The situation elsewhere is another story, the report says.
Slow growth in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s elevated the number of people living in poverty by 25 per cent, to nearly 500 million.
During the same period, the number of people living in poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean increased from 121 million to 132 million, with a quarter of the population still subsisting on USD$2 a day or less.
In the Middle East and North Africa, the number of people living at or below that line rose from 50 million to nearly 70 million, while in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the number increased three-fold to 97 million.

Terrorism and Development: Using Social and Economic Development to Inhibit a Resurgence of Terrorism
Source: RAND, Kim Cragin, Peter Chalk, 2003 Non-USG Publication
Abstract: This report examines the social and economic development policies enacted by three countries--Israel, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom--to inhibit a resurgence of terrorism within their jurisdictions.
Drawing on a broad research base, including numerous first-hand interviews, the authors outline the initiatives implemented by each country then assess their effectiveness, with the aim of informing U.S. decisionmakers of the benefits and pitfalls of such initiatives as they develop policy to counter terrorism.
Among their conclusions are the following: Social and economic development policies can weaken local support for terrorist activities and discourage terrorist recruits, and such policies can be used as a "stick" to discourage terrorism.
They caution, however, that the ability of these policies to inhibit terrorism depends on their implementation, and inadequately funded such policies are likely to renew support for terrorism.

Since the late 1990s, a fundamental shift has occurred in the pattern of private sector financial flows to developing countries.
Debt flows have fallen sharply, while equity flowsmainly in the form of foreign direct investmenthave remained comparatively robust.
This shift from debt to equity should diminish the volatility of developing countries external finance and improve their access to technology, markets, and management expertise.
But much more needs to be done to put development finance on a stable basis.The decline in debt flows, coupled with weak export revenues, has placed enormous pressure on the middle-income, highly indebted countries.
Many low-income countries face the triple burden of low commodity prices, unsustainable debt, and declining levels of aid.
Growth remains well short of what is necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

In contrast with the weak performance of several key developed and developing economies in recent months and the difficulties experienced by the information technology (IT) sector, Internet use and particularly electronic commerce have continued to grow at a fast pace since the publication of the E-Commerce and Development Report 2001.
The number of Internet users worldwide is expected to reach 655 million by the end of 2002.
Developing countries accounted for almost one third of new Internet users worldwide in 2001.
In most of them, however, Internet penetration rates remain very low.
As for e-commerce, the report presents three estimates of global online sales.
In the most optimistic forecast, e-commerce would represent about 18 per cent of worldwide business-to-business and retail transactions in 2006.
The effects of Internet-induced changes in the global economy and their implications for developing countries will depend to a significant extent on factors that policy-makers, business players and other stakeholders can influence.
Policies must be designed, articulated in coherent e-strategies and implemented in partnership with all the relevant players to ensure that the new opportunities for creating, transforming, applying and exchange information and value are used to improve the productivity of developing economies and their enterprises.

But the large size of the agricultural sector, the severe constraints on workers and households, the lack of public funds for adjustment, as well as the deficient laws and weak enforcement systems all demand that CAFTA be constructed with extraordinary care.
Otherwise, the positive opportunity could instead produce a major development setback.
To achieve progress and avoid peril, the United States will have to make proposals and take steps it has never undertaken.
U.S. negotiators have long recognized that a cookie-cutter approach to trade pacts does not produce good results.
CAFTA will be the most demanding test of their ability to break new ground.
RECIPROCITY IN FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS
Source: World Bank, Caroline Freund, May 20, 2003 Non-USG Publication
The results of this data analysis offer strong evidence of reciprocity in North-North and South-South free trade agreements, but there is little empirical support for reciprocity in North-South trade agreements.
In particular, after controlling for other determinants of trade preferences, the results suggest that a one percent increase in preferences offered leads to about a one-half of a percent increase in preferences received in North-North and South-South trade agreements.
Freund also finds evidence that large countries extract greater trade concessions from small countries.
This leads to a modified form of reciprocity in North-South agreements.
ADJUSTING TO TRADE LIBERALIZATION - THE ROLE OF POLICY, INSTITUTIONS AND WTO DISCIPLINES
Source: World Trade Organization, Marc Bacchetta and Marion Jansen, Web-posted May 23, 2003 Non-USG Publication
This study seeks to identify tools at the disposal of governments to smooth adjustment to liberalized trade regimes, to minimize an economy's adjustment costs and to alleviate the burden of those who suffer most.
Some of the salient conclusions from the study are: Trade liberalization is an agent of economic change, but evidence shows that it does not lead to drastic changes in a country's overall production structure; Adjustment costs are typically smaller, sometimes much smaller, than the gains from trade; Governments can identify individuals and groups that may suffer from the adjustment process and they can also develop policies to alleviate the burden falling on those adversely affected; Governments can adopt policies that influence the size of adjustment costs faced by the economy; Adjustment costs can be reduced if trade policy reforms are underpinned by international commitments; The pace of trade reforms can have a beneficial impact on adjustment costs; The implementation of trade reforms can have a beneficial impact on adjustment costs; The implementation of trade reforms at a gradual pace may lessen political opposition to change, but the risk of undermining reforms by adopting them too slowly must also be borne in mind; In many cases effective adjustment to trade liberalization will require the expansion of a country's export sector and this may be an argument for pro-export policies; WTO agreements seek to provide space for governments to tackle adjustment problems.
ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CHINAS ACCESSION TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
Source: World Bank, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3053, Elena Ianchovichina and William Martin, May 2003 Non-USG Publication
This paper presents estimates of the impact of accession by China and Chinese Taipei to the WTO.
China is estimated to be the biggest beneficiary, followed by Chinese Taipei and their major trading partners.
Accession will boost the labor-intensive manufacturing sectors in China and especially the textiles and apparel sector that will benefit directly from the removal of quotas on textiles and apparel exports to North America and Western Europe.
Consequently, developing economies competing with China in third markets may suffer relatively small losses.
China has already benefited from the reforms undertaken between 1995 and 2001 (US$31 billion) and trade reforms after accession will lead to additional gains of around $US10 billion.
Accession will have important distributional consequences for China, with wages of skilled workers and unskilled non-farm workers rising in real terms and relative to farm incomes.
Reduction in agricultural protection may hurt some farmers.
RESTORING G-8 LEADERSHIP OF THE WORLD ECONOMY: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE EVIAN SUMMIT FROM THE SHADOW G-8
Source: Institute for International Economics, May 2003 Non-USG Publication
The sharp disruption of relations among leading G-8 countries, due to the Iraq war and elements of the postwar planning, dramatically emphasizes the need for a successful G-8 summit at Evian in early June.
The summit in France will be the first meeting of Heads of State and Government, including those who have clashed sharply over the war, since its conclusion.
It is imperative that these leaders convincingly demonstrate their desire to achieve prompt reconciliation among their nations and to resist any temptations toward recrimination.
They can do so only by launching new initiatives that demonstrate both their will and their capacity to cooperate effectively.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: GROWTH AND INSTITUTIONS
Source: International Monetary Fund, April 2003 Non-USG Publication
For the past three months, concerns over conflict in the Middle East have weighed heavily on the global economy, through oil prices, through confidence effects and through financial markets.
As near-term uncertainties over the conflict recede, the question of the hour is whether present sputtering global growth will suddenly lunge ahead into an immediate strong recovery.
Perhaps, but our baseline here is for subnormal growth of 3.2 percent (1.1 trillion dollars) in 2003, rising to 4.1 percent in 2004.
This baseline assumes a tepid global recovery with normal growth only resuming sometime during the first half of 2004.
Across the major regions, the United States, which accounts for just over 1/5 of global GDP, is projected to have 2.2 percent growth in 2003 -- not yet enough to make a meaningful dent in unemployment -- and 3.6 percent growth in 2004.
Growth in the euro area (roughly 1/6th of global GDP) is again lackluster at 1.1 percent in 2003 and 2.3 percent in 2004.
Japan remains mired in a slump at 0.8 percent growth for 2003 and 1.0 percent for 2004.
Emerging Asia is in fact the strongest growing region of the world at 6.0 percent for 2003 and 6.3 percent for 2004, though we do not view this recovery as self-sustaining if the rest of the world slumps.
Moreover, the effects of the incipient SARS epidemic are likely to have an adverse impact (of perhaps about 0.4 percent if the epidemic lasts for one quarter).
The report has four main chapters, separately accessible:
Â· Economic Prospects and Policy Issues, with analyses of major regions, plus tables of output projections Â· When Bubbles Burst, which has two essays on the macroeconomic and financial aftereffects of the bursting of an asset price bubble Â· Growth and Institutions, including issues of history, geography, development levels and governance Â· Unemployment and Labor Market Institutions: Why Reforms Pay Off, examining differences between structural and transitional unemployment and some data on OECD and Euro zone nations

A key achievement this past year was the renewal of the Executive-Congressional partnership embodied in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA).
With that authority restored after a lapse of eight years, the Administration has begun to fulfill the vision of open markets and development articulated at the launch of new global trade negotiations in Doha, Qatar, in 2001.
The United States has submitted far-reaching proposals to the World Trade Organization (WTO), including plans to remove all tariffs on manufactured goods, open agriculture and services markets, and address the special needs of poorer developing countries.
Working closely with the Congress, the Administration capped the year by completing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with Chile and Singapore, which, when implemented, will open new markets for American exporters while expanding choice and value for American consumers.
By lowering prices through imports and increasing incomes through trade, Americas newest trade agreements will build on the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round.
The Bush Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress in 2003 to lay a firm foundation for a more prosperous America by passing the free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore; building upon administration proposals to open markets in global trade talks; advancing negotiations on the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA); negotiating new FTAs with the five countries of the Central American Common Market, Australia, Morocco, and the five countries of the Southern African Customs Union; enforcing U.S. trade laws; and monitoring and pressing Chinas and Taiwans compliance with their WTO obligations.

Securing economic freedom, governing justly and investing in people are key principles for promoting world economic growth, the White House says in a recent report.
"The economy is recovering from the effects of the slowdown that began in the middle of 2000 and led to the subsequent recession.
The American economy has been hit hard by the events of the past three years, most tragically by the effects of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
Our economy and investor confidence were hurt when we learned that some corporate leaders were not playing by the rules.
The combined impact of these events, along with the three-year decline in stock values that impacted business investment, slowed growth in 2002.
Despite these challenges, the economys underlying fundamentals remain solidincluding low inflation, low interest rates, and strong productivity gains.
Yet the pace of the expansion has not been satisfactory; there are still too many Americans looking for jobs.
We will not be satisfied until every part of our economy is vigorous and every person who wants a job can find one."

Resolution of disputes over steel, the U.S. export tax subsidy, and the EU ban on imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are at the top of the list of bilateral challenges.
In response to the Bush Administrations March 5, 2002 decision to impose temporary tariffs of up to 30% on approximately $8 billion in steel imports, the EU threatened to counter with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports throughout the spring and summer of this year.
But subsequent decisions by the Bush Administration to exempt about 50% of European steel from the tariffs helped persuade the EU not to retaliate against the United States without authorization from the WTO.
Similarly, both sides are working to avoid implementation of a August 30, 2002 WTO ruling that authorizes $4 billion in EU retaliation in the dispute over the U.S. export tax subsidy.
And the Bush Administration is under increased pressure from several farm organizations to request the creation of a special WTO panel to adjudicate the dispute involving the EUs ban on imports of food products containing GMOs.

The last comprehensive national water availability and use assessment, completed 25 years ago, identified critical problems, such as shortages and conflicts among users.
Future water availability and use is difficult to predict.
For example, while USDAs 1999 forecast of future water usenot availabilityprojects a rise in total withdrawals of only 7 percent by 2040, it also warns of the tenuous nature of such projections.
If the most important and uncertain assumptions used in USDAs projection, such as a decrease in irrigated acreage, fail to materialize, water use may be substantially above the estimate.
Current trends indicate that demands on the nations water resources are growing.
While the nations capacity for storing surface-water is limited and ground-water is being depleted, demands for freshwater are growing as the population increases, and pressures increase to keep water instream for fisheries, wildlife habitat, recreation, and scenic enjoyment.
For example, ground-water supplies have been significantly depleted in many parts of the country, most notably in the High Plains aquifer underlying eight western states, which in some areas now holds less than half of the water held prior to commencement of ground-water pumping.
Meanwhile, according to Bureau of the Census projections, the southwestern states of California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada, states that are already taxing their current water supplies, are each expected to see their population increase by more than 50 percent from 1995 to 2025.
Furthermore, the potential effects of climate change create additional uncertainty about future water availability and use.
For example, less snow pack as a result of climate change could harm states that rely extensively on melted snow runoff for their freshwater supply.
State water managers expect freshwater shortages in the near future, and their consequences could be severe.
According to the results of GAOs survey, even under normal water conditions, water managers in 36 states anticipate water shortages in localities, regions, or statewide within the next 10 years.
Under drought conditions, 46 managers expect shortages in the next 10 years.
Such shortages may be accompanied by severe economic, environmental, and social impacts.

The question of how U.S. energy supply and use which account for over 80 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will evolve over the next several decades is critical to developing sound U.S. climate policy.
To answer this question, the Pew Center convened two workshops with members of its Business Environmental Leadership Council and experts from the academic and NGO sectors to envision possible future energy scenarios and to draw policy-relevant conclusions from them.
This report includes discussion of these three scenarios, as well as assessments of key energy technologies for the future.
Three significant insights emerged: * Without a mandatory carbon constraint, the absolute level of U.S. emissions rises in the range of 15 to 50 percent over the year 2000 level in each of the Pew Center scenarios, despite the fact that the carbon intensity of the economy declines considerably.
This result points to a key conclusion of this report - policy is necessary to stem these increases and to address climate change; * A second conclusion of the report is that no matter which direction the future takes there are technologieswith supporting policies and investmentsthat could address climate change, accelerate capital stock turnover, and enhance energy security.
If U.S. decision-makers can implement the necessary policies and encourage appropriate investments during the next thirty years, the United States would be better positioned to achieve multiple public policy goals.
* Finally, the scenarios indicate that energy policy and investment decisions made today affect the difficulty of implementing a climate policy tomorrow.

The World Bank's new Environment Strategy focuses on environmental programs that will improve the well-being of poor people in developing countries.
The strategy advocates cost-effective reduction of air and water pollutants that are most harmful to human health.
In addition, it addresses threats to the livelihood of over one billion people who live on fragile lands (i.e., lands that are steeply sloped, arid, or covered by natural forests).
The new approach will require accurate information about environmental threats to health and livelihood, as well as an appropriate resource-allocation strategy.
Drawing on recent research at the World Bank and elsewhere, this paper attempts to contribute in three ways.
First, the authors develop a rule for optimal cross-country resource allocation that reflects the Bank's investment policy.
Using this rule, they estimate optimal country shares of Bank environmental investments from two sets of variables: threats from outdoor air pollution, water pollution and fragile lands; and estimates of the likelihood that Bank projects will succeed.
They combine the country shares with Bank investment data to estimate optimal country allocations.
Finally, we aggregate our country results to allocations for the major regions in which the Bank operates.
The authors find that the largest share of total optimal investment goes to East Asia (44%), followed by South Asia (21%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (19%).
Other regions get significantly lower shares (respectively 6%, 5% and 5% for Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and North Africa and the Middle East).
Within sectors, optimal investment patterns vary significantly.
Sub-Saharan Africa gets a large allocation for safe water (34%), exceeded only by East Asia (38%), while South Asia gets 15%.
Africa's allocation for cleaner air is strikingly lower (6%), in the same range as the lowest-investment regions, while East Asia (largely China) commands 50% and South Asia 24%.
The allocation for natural resource management is close to the overall allocation, with East Asia receiving 44%, South Asia 24%, Sub-Saharan Africa 15%, and the other regions much lower shares.

Communicating Europe

Democracy relies on communication between citizens and those in power.
However, at the European level, too often the strategy is to focus on sending out pro-European messages, rather than presenting the EU as a political system with room for disagreement, discussion and debate.
Unless the Convention takes account of how the newly constitutionalised EU links to its citizens via the media, it will produce solutions that fail to engage its stakeholders, and will reinforce the 'democratic deficit'.
Based on a unique study of the broadcast media across the EU, de Vreese defines how the media actually covers European issues, and lays out some concrete recommendations about how the EU must change.
The EU must redesign its communication strategies to take account of the methods broadcast journalists actually use to produce European stories; to use all the advantages the EU has to give the institutions a 'human face'; and to develop strong links between the European level of policymaking and the national media marketplaces.

LESSONS FROM THE PAST: THE AMERICAN RECORD IN NATION-BUILDING
Source: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Minxin Pei and Sara Kasper, April 11, 2003 Non-USG Publication
The record shows that democratic nation-building is among the most ambitious and difficult of foreign policy undertakings for the United States.
Of the 16 over the past century, democracy was sustained in only 4 countries ten years after the departure of American forces.
Two of these followed total defeat and surrender (in World War II) and two were in tiny countries (Grenada and Panama).
The record also reveals that unilateral nation-building by the United States has an even lower success rate perhaps because unilateralism has led to the creation of surrogate regimes and direct American administration during the interim post-conflict period.
The use of interim surrogate regimes has produced a record of complete failure.
No American-supported surrogate regime made the transition to democracy and only one case of direct American administration (in Japan) succeeded in ushering in democracy.
To heed the lessons of experience, the Bush administration should support a multilateral reconstruction strategy centered on bolstering political legitimacy and economic burden-sharing under the auspices of the United Nations.

The 13-member board, which on August 26 released its 248-page final report on the causes of the shuttle accident, also concluded that while the present space shuttle system of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is not "inherently unsafe," a number of mechanical fixes are required to make the shuttle safer in the short-term.
GLOBALIZATIONS SECURITY IMPLICATIONS

Globalization can promote prosperity, eradicate disease, and advance political freedom.
It can also promote transnational threats, including weapons of mass destruction.
This paper raises the broader issues arising from different aspects of globalization, focusing both on the threats and the opportunities, with the goal of suggesting very briefly a new way of approaching security in the coming decades.
Just as important, the paper tries to make the case that the national security and international economic policymaking communities each has a critical stake in what traditionally have been the responsibilities of the other.

REPORT OF THE JOINT WHO/FAO EXPERT CONSULTATION ON DIET, NUTRITION AND THE PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES
Source: World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Web-posted March 2003 Non-USG Publication
The WHO/FAO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases met in Geneva from 28 January to 1 February 2002 to examine the science base of the relationship between diet and physical activity patterns, and the major nutrition-related chronic diseases.
Recommendations were made to help prevent death and disability from major nutrition-related chronic diseases.
These population nutrient intake and physical activity goals should contribute in the development of regional strategies and national guidelines to reduce the burden of disease related to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, several forms of cancer, osteoporosis and dental disease.
The Expert Report urges national governments to aim for dietary guidelines that are simple, realistic and food-based.
Finland and Japan, countries that have actively intervened in the diet and nutritional behavior of their populations, have witnessed dramatic decreases in risk factors and plunging rates of chronic disease.
Recognizing that chronic diseases are preventable, addressing the issues and creating an environment which supports health, the Report says, is the key to reducing rates of deaths and disability from chronic diseases.
The process should establish working relationships between communities and governments, encourage local initiatives affecting schools and the workplace and also involve the food industry.
NEGOTIATING HEALTH SERVICES IN TRADE AND INTEGRATION AGREEMENTS IN THE AMERICAS
Source: Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Debra J. Lipson, with Ross Duncan and Soledad Salvador, January 2003 Non-USG Publication
The purpose of this document is to advance understanding of how trade and integration agreements can affect the health care system, and support capacity-building in the health sector to participate in negotiating trade and integration agreements.
It explains the rules concerning trade in services of major trade agreements at the global and regional level, explores how they could affect health care and policy, and provides a framework and options for managing trade in health services.
By educating health officials about services trade negotiations, it supports PAHO's objective in its 2003-2007 Strategic Plan for technical cooperation that results in an: "increase the number of countries able to demonstrate inclusion of health priorities in . . .the negotiation and implementation of trade and integration agreements at global, regional, sub-regional, and national levels."
Because many trade and integration agreements are broadly inclusive of all service sectors, they may inadvertently permit greater entry by foreign nationals into health service markets than country health officials want or are prepared to deal with.
On the other hand, if a country wants to expand foreign markets for their health service suppliers or allow greater foreign entry into their own health service markets, trade and integration agreements constitute a key policy lever.

Advances in information technology are heavily influencing ways in which business, society, and government work and function throughout the globe, bringing many changes to everyday life, in a process commonly termed the "information revolution."
This book paints a picture of the state of the information revolution today and how it will likely progress in the near- to mid-term future (10 to 15 years), focusing separately on different regions of the worldNorth America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa.
The ability to acquire and use knowledge will be critical for success in the information society, as knowledge work constitutes an increasing proportion of all work in the long-term future.
Accordingly, developing human capital appropriately is key.
A quality education for all will be one of the keys to a nations success in the information age.
This presents different challenges in different parts of the world.
Globalization, boosted by the information revolution, will continue to have multivalenced social and cultural effects.
While its economic effects are widely recognized, knowledgeable observers also give considerable weight to its societal implicationsboth positive and negative.
These include further widening of the gap between the political/intellectual/economic elites and others in developing nations, and the globalization of entertainment and, consequently, styles (or at least fads), which leads those in some countries to feel that their own national cultures are being vitiated.

Intensified education efforts are critical to shrinking the piracy problem further, BSA said.
According to this report, global software piracy rate declined to 39% in 2002, below its 1994 all-time high of 49%.
Worldwide, every country except Zimbabwe has reduced its rate of piracy since 1994, the year in which the study was first commissioned.

REGULATION AND INTERNET USE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
Source: AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, Scott Wallsten, May 2003 Non-USG Publication
Concerns about a worsening digital divide between rich and poor countries parallel the hope that information and computing technologies (ICTs) could increase economic growth in developing countries.
Little research, however, has explored ICT growth beyond noting that it is correlated with standard development indicators, and no empirical research has explored the role of regulation.
In this paper, Scott Wallsten uses data from a unique new survey of telecommunications regulators and other sources to measure the effects of regulation on Internet development.
Controlling for factors such as income, telecommunications infrastructure development, ubiquity of personal computers, and time trends, Mr. Wallsten finds that countries requiring formal regulatory approval for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to operate have fewer Internet users and hosts than countries that do not require such approval.
Moreover, countries that regulate ISP final-user prices have higher Internet access prices than countries without such regulations.
These results suggest that developing countries own regulatory policies can have large impacts on the digital divide.
BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS: BACKGROUND AND ISSUES
Source: CRS Report, Angele A. Gilroy and Lennard G. Kruger, Library of Congress, updated May 5, 2003 USG: Official Publications
Broadband or high-speed Internet access is provided by a series of technologies that give users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds far greater than current Internet access over traditional telephone lines.
Currently, a number of telecommunications companies are developing, installing, and marketing specific technologies and services to provide broadband access to the home.
Meanwhile, the federal government - through Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) - is seeking to ensure fair competition among the players so that broadband will be available and affordable in a timely manner to all Americans who want it.
Broadband access, along with the content and services it might enable, has the potential to transform the Internet - both what it offers and how it is used.
For example, a two-way high speed connection could be used for interactive applications such as online classrooms, showrooms, or health clinics, where teacher and student (or customer and salesperson, doctor and patient) can see and hear each other through their computers.
An always on connection could be used to monitor home security, home automation, or even patient health remotely through the Web.
The high speed and high volume that broadband offers could also be used for bundled service where, for example, cable television, video on demand, voice, data, and other services are all offered over a single line.
In truth, it is possible that many of the applications that will best exploit the technological capabilities of broadband, while also capturing the imagination of consumers, have yet to be developed.

In contrast with the weak performance of several key developed and developing economies in recent months and the difficulties experienced by the information technology (IT) sector, Internet use and particularly electronic commerce have continued to grow at a fast pace since the publication of the E-Commerce and Development Report 2001.
The number of Internet users worldwide is expected to reach 655 million by the end of 2002.
Developing countries accounted for almost one third of new Internet users worldwide in 2001.
In most of them, however, Internet penetration rates remain very low.
As for e-commerce, the report presents three estimates of global online sales.
In the most optimistic forecast, e-commerce would represent about 18 per cent of worldwide business-to-business and retail transactions in 2006.
The effects of Internet-induced changes in the global economy and their implications for developing countries will depend to a significant extent on factors that policy-makers, business players and other stakeholders can influence.
Policies must be designed, articulated in coherent e-strategies and implemented in partnership with all the relevant players to ensure that the new opportunities for creating, transforming, applying and exchange information and value are used to improve the productivity of developing economies and their enterprises.

August 2003 Non-USG Publication
This report makes one major assumption: with the end of Baathist repression and new political openings there are no grounds for believing that newly emerging Iraqi politics will dramatically depart from the many familiar patterns of general politics in the Arab world.
To be sure, every country is unique, and Iraq has had its own quite special experience over the past five decades.
History, geography, and geopolitics furthermore put their distinctive stamp on any country.
Nonetheless, there are some general patterns of politics and aspirations across the Arab world to which a freer Iraq will not likely be a stranger.
One of these major characteristics is that in most of the Arab world Islamist movements constitute the most important, if not the sole, segment of opposition to existing regimes.
Political Islam will thus strongly emerge in post-Hussein Iraqindeed, there are clear indications that they already have.
But an important qualification is essential here: Islamist parties also benefit immensely from the absence of other rivalsas repressive states close down all opposition groups.
In today's Iraq, some degree of political competition will be present that will set some limits to any Islamist monopoly on politics.
But what forms will these trends take and how will they interact with other forces in the country? This report examines three major Islamist trends that operate within Iraq's three major sectarian/ethnic communities: the majority Shia Arabs, the Sunni Arabs, and the Kurds.

It has come to be recognized as a key player in covering issues of central importance to U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East: the conflict in Iraq, the war on terrorism, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Al-Jazeera has become so publicly influential that U.S. officials now regularly appear on the network.
Although Al-Jazeera has received praise for its uncensored format and for airing interviews with U.S. and Israeli officials, as well as Arab critics of the policies of Arab governments, it has drawn criticism from many observers in the United States and elsewhere for a perceived lack of objectivity in covering these conflicts, including the activities of Al Qaeda.
For their part, officials from Al-Jazeera have claimed that theymerely reflect Arab popular resentment of U.S. policy in the Middle East.

Pro-Western Arab regimes fear the backlash from their populations who are angered by the harsh Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the failure of the United States to compel Israel to create a viable Palestinian state.
This monograph explores the interplay of the national interests of the United States, Israel, and the Arab world.
It analyzes the challenges to current American policies in the Middle East created by the interrelationships of radical Arab regimes, Israel, and the moderate Arab states.
According to the author, the current U.S. administration, with its focus on combating radical Islamic terrorism and stabilizing Iraq, has tilted the balance towards Israel.
This has serious consequences for Americas relations with Egypt, Jordan, and the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Although these moderate Arab states all depend on the United States for their security from external threats, they all confront internal challenges to the legitimacy of their regimes.
Saudi Arabia in particular faces intense criticism from radical Islamists who resent Americas support of Israel and have demanded the complete expulsion of infidel forces, as well as facing the calls for more political participation from sectors in the Saudi elite.
Moreover, Washington has downplayed the Saudi peace plan in favor of a peace process described by the road map to peace.
AFTER VICTORY: TOWARD A NEW MILITARY POSTURE IN THE PERSIAN GULF
Source: Cato Institute, Christopher Preble, June 10, 2003 Non-USG Publication
The author advocates an ever-decreasing permanent U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf region.
In addition to the removal of troops from Saudi Arabia, he states that U.S. forces should be withdrawn from other Gulf states, including Qatar, Kuwait, and Iraq, and the U.S. Navy should terminate its long-standing policy of deploying a carrier battle group in the Persian Gulf.
The United States need not have troops stationed in the Persian Gulf in order to remain engaged in the region.
The Gulf's energy resources are important to the global economy, but goods and services flow on the world market absent explicit "protection" by military forces.
Further, the United States will continue to exert a stabilizing influence from a distance by drawing on its economic assets and its political standing.
In the highly unlikely event that regional conditions threaten vital U.S. security interests, the United States can draw on the military's capacity for projecting force over great distances.
IS GRADUALISM POSSIBLE? CHOOSING A STRATEGY FOR PROMOTING DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST

As part of the changed U.S. geostrategic outlook arising from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, the Bush administration is giving greatly heightened attention to the issue of promoting democracy in the Middle East.
Although a policy of coercive regime change has been applied in Iraq, the administration has pursued a more gradualist model of political change in most of the region.
There is still little consensus among U.S. policy makers regarding the best approach for implementing democracy.
This working paper assesses three competing strategies that have emerged within the growing domain of gradualist pro-democratic policies and programs.

The Road Ahead Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq

With the war in Iraq has come the responsibility to win the peace.
Military planners have demonstrated that rapid deployment of special operations personnel and judicious use of traditional military assets designed to contend with every reasonable contingency are appropriate for modern wars with countries such as Iraq.
A similar doctrine is also appropriate in the wake of such wars, especially during the critical eighteen-month window that begins with the first day of the peace, when postwar environments are most vulnerable to instability and a relapse into violence.
Germany, Japan, and Afghanistan offer several positive and negative lessons on appropriate policy and behavior during a period of military governance in Iraq.
IRAQI MOBILE BIOLOGICAL WARFARE AGENT PRODUCTION PLANTS

From the Overview section of this report: Coalition forces have uncovered the strongest evidence to date that Iraq was hiding a biological warfare program.
* Kurdish forces in late April 2003 took into custody a specialized tractor-trailer near Mosul and subsequently turned it over to US military control.
* The US military discovered a second mobile facility equipped to produce BW agent in early May at the al-Kindi Research, Testing, Development, and Engineering facility in Mosul.
Although this second trailer appears to have been looted, the remaining equipment, including the fermentor, is in a configuration similar to the first plant.
* US forces in late April also discovered a mobile laboratory truck in Baghdad.
The truck is a toxicology laboratory from the 1980s that could be used to support BW or legitimate research.
The design, equipment, and layout of the trailer found in late April is strikingly similar to descriptions provided by a source who was a chemical engineer that managed one of the mobile plants.

LIBERALIZATION VERSUS DEMOCRACY: UNDERSTANDING ARAB POLITICAL REFORM
Source: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Daniel Brumberg, May 2003 Non-USG Publication
According to the author, no administration has talked more about democracy in the Middle East than the Bush administration.
The president and his advisors have spoken optimistically about a post-Saddam democracy in Iraq, one that might eventually become a veritable light to other Arab nations.
This grand vision assumes that sooner or later, advocates of democracy throughout the Middle East will demand the same freedoms and rights that Iraqis are now claiming.
Yet, however inspiring this vision appears, the actual reform plan that the administration has thus far set out is unlikely to produce radical changes in the Arab world.
As Secretary of State Colin Powell suggested in his November 2002 Middle East Partnership Initiative, and in the subsequent statement he gave to the Arab press, the United States will work with Arab leaders to carefully and slowly reform their autocracies.
Regardless how dramatic the change in Baghdad is, when it comes to our friends in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, and Yemen, the administrations reform plan points to evolution rather than revolution.

Executive Summary #1646, April 21, 2003 Non-USG Publication
The U.N. is slowly dying as a force on the world stage and will go the way of the League of Nations unless it is radically reformed and restructured.
It failed spectacularly to deal with the growing threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and its influence may well diminish further in the coming years.
Indeed, what happens to the U.N. in the future very much depends upon how it behaves here and now.
President Bush should make it clear that no further discussions on the Iraq issue are needed at the U.N.
Indeed, the role of the United Nations in a post-war Iraq should be limited to purely humanitarian involvement.
The United States and the United Kingdom should take the lead in administering a post-war Iraqi transition government, with the U.N. playing only a subordinate role.

International law on belligerent occupation does not address the question of the legality of occupation.
Its rules apply to any occupying power for the sole fact that it is in control of a foreign territory, whatever the reason for this situation.
Recognizing the applicability of such a law to a given situation does not constitute a judgment on the legal status of the territory concerned.
The provisions of the law on belligerent occupation are found in international humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war or the laws on armed conflict.
As such, they take into account the military and security concerns of the occupying power, balancing them against the rights of those who find themselves under its authority.

DOES THE CONSTITUTION FOLLOW THE FLAG?: IRAQ, THE WAR ON TERROR, AND THE REACH OF THE LAW
Source: Kal Raustiala, FindLaws Legal Commentary, April 9, 2003 Non-USG Publication
A bedrock principle of American democracy is that the Constitution defines and limits our government.
Yet does the Constitution constrain the exercise of government power abroad? For instance, would it constrain the U.S. if we occupy Iraq after the war ends? Moreover, the question of the Constitution's extraterritorial reach itself is perhaps misleading.
The Constitution certainly applies globally.
The real question is how it applies, and whether specific rights guaranteed by the Constitution are somehow territorially-limited.
Existing precedents suggest that they are.
Even when the U.S. annexes territory, inhabitants of the territory do not necessarily enjoy the full protection of the Constitution.
Meanwhile, when the U.S. occupies foreign territory, pursuant to military action, or leases territory, pursuant to a treaty, the constitutional constraints are even weaker--some would say non-existent.

Source: CRS Report for Congress, by Steve Bowman, Specialist in National Defense, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, updated April 7, 2003 USG: Official Publications
Iraqs chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons programs, together with Iraqi long-range missile development and support for terrorism, are the primary justifications put forward by the Bush Administration for military action.
Since Iraq originally ended cooperation with U.N. inspectors in 1998, there has been little information on the state of Iraqs weapons of mass destruction (WMD) arsenal; however, Administration officials are convinced that Iraq has reconstituted significant capabilities.
On March 17, 2003 President Bush issued an ultimatum demanding that Saddam Hussein and his sons depart from Iraq within 48 hours.
On March 19, offensive operations began with air strikes against Iraqi leadership positions.
Iraq: U.S. Regime Change Efforts and the Iraqi Opposition
Source: CRS Report for Congress, by Kenneth Katzman, Specialist in Middle Eastern Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, updated April 7, 2003 USG: Official Publications
In his 2002 and 2003 State of the Union messages, President Bush characterized Iraq as a grave potential threat to the United States because of its refusal to abandon its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs as required by U.N. Security Council resolutions and the potential for it to transfer WMD to terrorist groups.
Since September 2002, the President has said that unless Iraq fully disarms in cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors, the United States would lead a coalition to achieve that disarmament militarily.
U.S. officials have made clear that this would include the ouster of Iraqs President Saddam Husseins regime.
On March 17, 2003, the United States launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, a war effort to disarm Iraq and change its regime.

POLITICAL RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ: A REALITY CHECK
Source: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Marina Ottaway and Judith Yaphe, March 27, 2003 USG: Official Publications
Plans for the political reconstruction of Iraq are bound to fail if they do not take into consideration that Iraq is not a political blank slate to be transformed at American will into a democratic, secular, pluralist, and federal state.
It is a difficult country with multiple social groups and power centers with conflicting agendas.
The United States must not try to impose a system of its own devising on these groups.
Loose talk about bringing democracy to Iraq confuses what external actors can do and what Iraqis alone can accomplish.
The United States should also not underestimate the extent to which broader U.S. policies toward the Middle East and its handling of Iraq's oil will affect the willingness of parties within and outside Iraq to cooperate in its peaceful reconstruction.
Washington's next steps in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in relations with Iran, and in shaping a new regional security system will determine whether the Iraq war is the beginning or the end of regional crisis and bloodshed.
POST-WAR IRAQ: ARE WE READY
Source: Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Bathsheba N. Crocker, March 25, 2003 USG: Official Publications
The Bush Administration has done considerable planning for the postwar phase in Iraq, and comprehensive preparations on many fronts have been made in advance.
Nonetheless, significant gaps remain.
This document sets forth a scorecard of the Administrations preparations for the post-conflict reconstruction phase thus far, drawing on all available information the Administration has chosen to make public.
The issues addressed below draw and build upon the recommendations in A Wiser Peace: An Action Strategy for a Post-Conflict Iraq, published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in mid-January 2003.
Overall, this scorecard gives the Administration a mixed grade on its planning and preparations, which have been significant in certain areas but are still seriously lagging in others.
War Powers Resolution: Presidential Compliance
Source: CRS Report for Congress, Richard F. Grimmett, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, updated March 24, 2003 USG: Official Publications
Two separate but closely related issues confront Congress each time the President introduces armed forces into a situation abroad that conceivably could lead to their involvement in hostilities.
One issue concerns the division of war powers between the President and Congress, whether the use of armed forces falls within the purview of the congressional power to declare war and the War Powers Resolution.
The other issue is whether Congress concurs in the wisdom of the action.
This issue brief does not deal with the substantive merits of using armed forces in specific cases, but rather with the congressional authorization for the action and the application and effectiveness of the War Powers.

A VIEW FROM THE ARAB WORLD: A SURVEY IN FIVE COUNTRIES
Source: Brookings Institution, Shibley Telhami, March 13, 2003 Non-USG Publication
Under the sponsorship of the Sadat Chair for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, Shibley Telhami prepared a public opinion survey for Zogby International, which interviewed 2,620 men and women in Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Jordan.
The survey was conducted between February 19 and March 11.
It focuses on perceptions of the United States in specific political scenarios and on views of United States policy abroad.
Previous polls done by Shibley Telhami and by Zogby International in the Middle East showed that neither United States policy nor the United States was viewed favorably.
Very few people in the survey countries have a favorable opinion of the United States: Only 4% in Saudi Arabia, 6% in Morocco and Jordan, 13% in Egypt, and 32% in Lebanon.
Most people say that their attitudes toward the U.S. are based on American policies, not on American values.
Despite the U.S. claim that it intends to spread democratic values and ideals throughout the world, war with Iraq will bring less democracy in the view of 95% of Saudis, 66% of Moroccans, 60% of Egyptians, 58% of Jordanians, and 74% of Lebanese.
DISARMING IRAQ BY FORCE: WMD STAKES AND SCENARIOS
Source: Monterey Institute of International Studies, Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), Michael Barletta, March 7, 2003 Non-USG Publication
Anticipating the consequences of the coming conflict is not a simple matter.
The stakes in the coming clash include a wide range of possible positive and negative consequences.
Of these, we can at best estimate which will most likely happen, which may ensue, and which are unlikely to occur.
However, systematically estimating the likelihood of costs and benefits can aid in anticipating events, and offer a pragmatic basis for favoring or opposing war, as compared to alternative courses of action to address WMD threats posed by Iraq.
International Law and the Preemptive Use of Force Against Iraq
Source: CRS Report for Congress, David M. Ackerman, Legislative Attorney, American Law Division, updated March 17, 2003 USG: Official Publications
In his speech to the United Nations on September 12, 2002, President Bush described the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq as a grave and gathering danger, detailed that regimes persistent efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and its persistent defiance of numerous Security Council resolutions requiring Iraq to disarm, and raised the specter of an outlaw regime providing such weapons to terrorists.
The President left little doubt that, with or without UN support, the United States would act to force Iraq to disarm and otherwise abide by its past commitments, and that military force might well be used to accomplish that objective.
One issue raised by that policy is the legality of the preemptive use of force under international law.
This report examines that issue as developed in customary international law and under the United Nations Charter.
It will be updated as events warrant.

The President should "make clear to the Congress, to the American people, and to the people of Iraq that the United States will stay the course" after a war in Iraq, concludes the Council-sponsored Independent Task Force, Iraq: the Day After.
Post-war stabilization and reconstruction could cost up to $20 billion a year for several years, and American public support is critical to sustaining that commitment.
Promoting Democracy in the Middle East: The Problem of U.S. Credibility
Source: Working Paper No. 35, Marina Ottaway, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, March 2003 Non-USG Publication
After decades of giving relatively little attention to the possibility and problems of democracy in the Middle East, the U.S. foreign policy community has in the past year elevated the issue to a position of central importance.
In this working paper, Marina Ottaway highlights a problem of fundamental significancethe lack of credibility that the United States has in the Arab world when it presents itself as a pro-democratic actor.
Although many Americans may feel that America's bona fides as a pro-democratic actor are unquestionable, the stubborn fact remains that many people in other parts of the world, especially the Middle East, have a different opinion.
If left unaddressed, this credibility gap will undermine even the most well-intentioned efforts by the United States to promote positive political change in the region.
While recognizing that there are no instant solutions to this problem, the paper identifies ways the United States can begin to alleviate the gap and in so doing pave the way for a genuine, lasting democratic engagement with the Middle East.

In past confrontations with the West, Iraqi President Saddam Husayn has used thousands of foreign and Iraqi civilians as human shields in bids to manipulate domestic and international opinion and deter military action against his regime.
This tactic has produced clear costs and only marginal gains for Saddam, yet he repeatedly has enacted variations of it since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

Iraq War? Current Situation and Issues for Congress
Source: CRS Report for Congress, Raymond W. Copson (Coordinator), Specialist in International Relations Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, Feb. 20, 2003 USG: Official Publications
On November 8, 2002, the United Nations Security Council, acting at U.S. urging, adopted Resolution 1441, giving Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its the disarmament obligations or face serious consequences.
During January 2003, the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf continued, amid reports that U.S. forces would be ready to launch a war by mid-February or early March.
President Bush, other top U.S. officials, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have indicated that Iraq has little time left to offer full cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
However, the inspectors themselves, with leaders of France, Germany, and other countries, are urging that the inspections process be allowed more time.
The Administration asserts that Iraq is in defiance of 16 Security Council resolutions requiring that it fully declare and eliminate its weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
Skeptics, including many foreign critics, maintain that the Administration is exaggerating the Iraqi WMD threat.
Iraq: Weapons Threat, Compliance, Sanctions, and U.S. Policy

The United States is currently attempting to maintain an international consensus for strict enforcement of all applicable U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iraq, and is threatening and preparing for military action against Iraq if Iraq does not soon disarm.
In the wake of the September 11 attacks, there has been heightened U.S. concern about the potential threat posed by Iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs and alleged ties to terrorist groups.
However, many governments say they would only support U.S. military action to disarm Iraq and, in the process, change Iraqs regime, if the action is taken with U.N. authorization.

Would an Invasion of Iraq Be a "Just War"?
Source: USIP, January 2003 Non-USG Publication
A new Institute report examines whether an American attack on Iraq would satisfy Christian just war criteria.
During the months leading up to the Gulf War in 1991, there was considerable discussion of whether an American attack to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait would satisfy Christian just war criteria.
Much less discussion of this question has occurred in recent months during which the United States and its allies have considered an invasion of Iraq.
In order to focus attention on this issue, the U.S. Institute of Peace organized a symposium on December 17, 2002 in which four presenters were asked to answer the question, "Would an invasion of Iraq be a "just war"?
IRAQ: WHAT NEXT?
Source: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Joseph Cirincione, Jessica T. Mathews and George Perkovich, with Miriam Rajkumar, Marshall Breit and Dipali Mukhopadhyay, January 2003 Non-USG Publication
The authors of this report conclude that, far from being exhausted, the inspections process has just begun.
Inspections should be pursued without ruling out future use of force.
Iraq's lack of full cooperation is a material breach, but not a casus belli.
As the report argues, "Disarmament achieved without a war would be an enormous-and enormously popular-achievement."
In the meantime, "Saddam Hussein is effectively incarcerated and under watch by a force that could respond immediately and devastatingly to his aggression."
However, if the aim is not, in fact, disarmament but regime change as a matter of principle, "then the inspection and disarmament processes now underway are largely irrelevant."

Israel is not economically self-sufficient, and relies on foreign assistance and borrowing to maintain its economy.
Since 1985, the United States has provided $3 billion in grants annually to Israel.
Since 1976, Israel has been the largest annual recipient of U.S. foreign assistance, and is the largest cumulative recipient since World War II.
In addition to U.S. assistance, it is estimated that Israel receives about $1 billion annually through philanthropy, an equal amount through short- and long- term commercial loans, and around $1 billion in Israel Bonds proceeds.

FACING SADDAM'S CHILD SOLDIERS
Source: Brookings Institution, Iraq Memo #8, Peter W. Singer, Jan. 14, 2003 Non-USG Publication
Among the litany of human rights violations committed by Saddam Husayn [sic] is that his regime deliberately recruits children into its armed forces, in violation of both international law and widely accepted moral norms.
As a result, U.S. and allied forces must prepare for the fact that they will likely face child soldiers in a potential war with Iraq.
They must consider the costs and tough choices now, so that they do not later find themselves ill-equipped or untrained for the unique challenges that child soldiers present.
Iraq's employment of child soldiers will present a considerable challenge for U.S. public diplomacy, especially in the Arab world (but also at home), where images of coalition forces fighting Iraqi children could have profound consequences.

ARF was created in 1994 by the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to "foster constructive dialogue and consultation on political and security issues of common interest and concern...and to make significant contributions to efforts towards confidence-building and preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region."
The authors suggest that Secretary Powell should do the following: Encourage greater cooperation on terrorism; Insist on military reform in Indonesia; Encourage peace talks between Manila and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF); Warn about the threat of maritime terrorism and encourage countries in the region to take action to protect their ports and territorial waters.
Meet with North Korea in a multilateral meeting that also includes South Korea, Japan, and China; Urge ARF to adopt measures to curtail North Korean proliferation activities; Ask China to address the North Korean refugee problem; Offer China refugee assistance and seek cooperation on refugees from other countries in the region; Restate America's commitment to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea; Support ASEAN's efforts to create a code of conduct that protects the security and economic well-being of countries littoral to the South China Sea; Seek an accord on the South China Sea, with or without China; and Recommend that ARF include defense ministers in its next annual meeting.

This paper presents various advisory groups major recommendations on strategic and substantive policy issues, which have not yet been adopted by the Bush Administration but that we feel warrant additional examination.
This paper uses as its framework the six critical mission areas and four foundations of homeland security, as defined in President Bushs National Strategy for Homeland Security.
The critical mission areas are intelligence and warning, border and transportation security, domestic counterterrorism emergency preparedness and response, protecting critical infrastructures and key assets, defending against catastrophic threats, and emergency preparedness and response (the authors address all but the last mission area in this paper).
The four foundations are the law, science and technology, information sharing and systems, and international cooperation (again, the authors address all but the last foundation).

Terrorism and Development: Using Social and Economic Development to Inhibit a Resurgence of Terrorism
Source: RAND, Kim Cragin, Peter Chalk, 2003 Non-USG Publication
Abstract: This report examines the social and economic development policies enacted by three countries--Israel, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom--to inhibit a resurgence of terrorism within their jurisdictions.
Drawing on a broad research base, including numerous first-hand interviews, the authors outline the initiatives implemented by each country then assess their effectiveness, with the aim of informing U.S. decisionmakers of the benefits and pitfalls of such initiatives as they develop policy to counter terrorism.
Among their conclusions are the following: Social and economic development policies can weaken local support for terrorist activities and discourage terrorist recruits, and such policies can be used as a "stick" to discourage terrorism.
They caution, however, that the ability of these policies to inhibit terrorism depends on their implementation, and inadequately funded such policies are likely to renew support for terrorism.
