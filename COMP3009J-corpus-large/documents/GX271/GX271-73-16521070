Where did the Moon come from? Here's a Native American story that gives an explanation.
Read the story and then answer questions 5 through 14.
Snowballll Moon 1 Once far to the north, the winter nights were long and cold and dark.
They were so dark that the little woodland animals could barely gather enough food to survive the winter.
No matter how fast they scurried about for nuts and seeds, the darkness came quickly.
Finally, Squirrel decided that something must be done.
First she visited the field mice.
"Oh, it's a terrible problem," said Father Mouse.
"We have so many children to feed, and the winter nights are so dark."
"Don't worry," said Squirrel.
"I will help you."
So Squirrel went to see Porcupine and asked him if he had trouble finding food during the long dark winter.
"Oh, yes," said Porcupine.
"But it has always been this way.
There is nothing to be done."
"I don't agree," said Squirrel.
"There is always something to be done."
"It's best to leave things as they are," said Porcupine.
With a shake of his quills, he waddled off through the snow.
So Squirrel decided to ask Owl.
Owl rested by day and sailed through the woods at night, with eyes bigger than all the other animals'.
Maybe Owl knew a way to bring light to the winter forest.
Squirrel climbed high in Owl's maple tree and waited for Owl to wake up.
"What is it Squirrel?" asked Owl.
"We small woodland animals need to hunt by darkness as well as day.
The northern winter nights are far too dark for us.
It would only take a little light to help us see."
Owl hunched his feathery head into his shoulders to think.
He thought all day long, while Squirrel shivered on the windy branch.
Finally, he said in his owly, hooting voice, "I will talk to the Sky Father and see if he can bring the stars closer in the winter."
Happily, Squirrel twitched her tail and raced down the tree to her burrow.
Several days later, Owl stopped at Squirrel's doorstep.
"Tell your small friends that the Sky Father will bring the stars closer.
But first, he must clear all the clouds from the sky.
Prepare for a terrible blizzard."
And Owl flew off.
So the animals gathered all the nuts and berries and seeds they could.
Then they huddled in a hollow log and watched the huge storm clouds gather overhead.
For three days, the Sky Father piled storm clouds in the sky, stacking them in huge towers.
The animals shivered below, waiting.
On the third day, the storm broke.
A blizzard howled through the woods.
The animals were frightened, all except Squirrel.

5 NH Â­ Grade 3 Released Items Â­ 2001Â­02
When the storm died away, a huge snowdrift blocked the hollow log.
The animals could see nothing but gray shadows.
They were disappointed, thinking more hunger and darkness awaited them.
"Wait here," said Squirrel.
"I will tunnel out and see if the stars are closer."
Squirrel scrabbled up and up.
Finally, she reached the top and her head popped out.
She gasped in surprise.
The winter stars hung so low in the evening sky, it seemed she could almost touch them.
A large, antlered moose stepped forward and bowed his head.
"I have been sent to help you," he said.
"If you little animals will gather all the snow you can and push it into a giant snowball, I will carry the snowball in my antlers across the highest mountain ridges, where it will shed light on even the darkest winter nights."
And so, with the help of the moose and the Sky Father, the little animals made the first moon.
And, despite the cold, the animals are happy in the winter when the stars come close and the moon shines bright like snow in the sky.

"Les Billes" will tell you about a game enjoyed by children in France.
Read the article to find out how it is played and then answer questions 22 through 26.
LES BILLES France If you lived in France, your school day would be long.
French schoolchildren usually go to school from 8:30 in the morning until 4:30 or 5:00 in the afternoon.
But your lunch period would be two hours! On Saturday morning you might attend school, but on Wednesday you might only go until noon--or not at all.
At recess and after school, many French children play les billes (pronounced lay beey), the French word for marbles.
Children play les billes many ways in France.
Here's one way to play it.
Les Billes Number of players: What you'll need: 2 to 6 chalk large and small marbles
How to play: 1.
Draw a circle 10 to 12 feet (about 3 meters) in diameter.
2.
Each player decides to place either one or two large marbles inside the circle.
3.
The first player attempts to hit the marbles by flicking them with a smaller marble.
The object is to hit one or both marbles outside of the circle in just one hard flick.
4.
If any of the hit marbles roll outside the circle, the person flicking collects them.
They then belong to that player.
Whatever marbles remain in the circle, including the one that was used to flick, remain as a target for the next player.
5.
The next player attempts to flick the marbles remaining in the circle out of the circle.
The game has no specific ending time.
When no marbles remain in the circle, players put one or two marbles in the circle again.
The player who collects the most marbles wins.

Where does a river come from? Where does it go? The author of "River to the Sea" tells you all about the West River.
Read the article and then answer questions 32 through 40.
River to the Sea by Stephen K. Swinburne you have a river for a neighbor, you can't help but get wet.
I live beside the West River in Vermont.
It's deep enough to swim in and as wide as a two-lane road.
I've fished and skimmed stones on the West River.
I've even fallen in.
But for all the time I've spent playing in the river, I didn't know where it began or where it ended.
I decided to find out.
Rivers often start in the mountains with no more than a trickle.
Rain, melting snow, and water from springs have nowhere to go but down.
As trickles follow the easiest paths down, they combine to form brooks.
Brooks join to become streams, and streams meet to become rivers.
As more and more water joins a river, it gets wider and deeper and faster.
That's what happens to the West River.
I followed a map to learn this.
I drove, then hiked, into the wooded hills about fifteen miles north of my house.
I saw that the West River begins as a dribble, skinny as a pencil.
By the time it reaches my town, it has become a river.
Rivers work hard.
They're great diggers.
The swift current of a river is a watery shovel digging up pebbles, silt, and sand.
Rivers are also carriers.
They carry lots of rocks and sand downstream.
In most large rivers, the current is strongest in the deepest part.
Most rivers eventually empty into the sea.
Once again, I got into my car with a map, this time to see where the West River goes.
I followed it through the countryside of southern Vermont to find that it merges with the wide Connecticut River.
The Connecticut River flows out of Vermont, south into Massachusetts, then into Connecticut.
It finally joins Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean.
The river outside my door is connected to faraway places.
It's neat to know that if I launched a sturdy boat into the river by my house, someday it might reach the open sea.
That's the best thing about a river.
It's water on the move, and it knows just where to go.
