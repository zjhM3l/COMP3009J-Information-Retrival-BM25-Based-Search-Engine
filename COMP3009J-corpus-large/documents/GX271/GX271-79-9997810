In 2000, the difference between the lowest and highest median earnings by age group was $1,110, ranging from $16,820 for women age 25 to 34 years to $17,930 for women age 65 years and over.
Median earnings of full-time, year-round women workers with a bachelor 's degree were lowest for women in the younger (age 25 to 34 years) and older (age 65 years and over) age groups.
Median earnings of full-time, year-round women workers 35 to 44 years, although women in the age groups of 45 to For women full-time, year-round workers with a bachelor median earnings by age group was $10,759, ranging from women age 35 to 44 years.

The earnings gap was greatest for women high school graduates in the 55 to 64 years age group.
Women full-time, year-round workers in this group had median earnings that were less than three-fifths (58.7%) of the earnings of men in the same age and educational attainment group in 2000.
The earnings gap between men and women full-time, year-round workers with a bachelor 's degree was smallest (78.3%) for women in the 25 to 34 years age group in 2000.

WORK-LIFE EARNINGS
BY
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT
AND SEX
Synthetic work-life earnings (formerly referred to as life-time earnings) are estimates of the total average earnings adults are likely to accumulate over the course of their working lives based on a hypothetical 40-year working life from ages 25 through 64 years.
Work-life estimates are created by using the working population's one-year annual average earnings and summing their age-specific average earnings for people ages 25 to 64 years.
The earnings presented in the following charts are illustrative and do not predict actual future earnings.
All estimates are based on average or mean earnings and are in 1999 dollars.
The estimates reflect earnings at different levels of educational attainment but do not account for differences in the earning potential of various fields of study within the levels, an individual's work history, or the motivation and effort put in at work by an individual.
ALL WORKERS The chart below contains work-life estimates for all workers (which includes workers who work part-time or for part of the year).
Historically, women's labor force attachment has been more variable than men's due mostly to competing family caregiving responsibilities.
Earnings estimates based on all workers include some of this variability in work experience.

Educational attainment has a major impact on earnings over a work-life as earnings differences compound over time.
In general, each increasing level of attainment has higher earnings than the one below it for both men and women.
The exception is workers with professional degrees (e.g., physicians, lawyers, veterinarians) who have the highest earnings.
Men's work-life earnings were higher than women's work-life earnings for workers at all levels of educational attainment.
Work-life earnings ranged from just over one-half million dollars for women workers with no high school diploma (or GED) to $2.5 million for women workers with a professional degree.
Women workers with an associate's degree are estimated to earn $1.1 million, nearly double the work-life earnings of a women who is not a high school graduate.
Women full-time, year-round workers with a bachelor 's degree are estimated to earn $1.3 million, nearly 1.7 times the work-life earnings of a high school graduate.

The chart below contains synthetic work-life estimates for full-time, year-round workers (which include people who work 35 and more hours a week for at least 50 weeks in a year) assuming full employment throughout one's work-life.
These estimates do not account for an individual's past partial employment or unemployment, which may reduce current full-time earnings.
Earnings estimates based on full-time, year-round workers provide a more comparable view of potential earnings.

Work experience influences earnings.
The work-life earnings of full-time, year-round workers were higher than the work-life earnings of all workers at all levels of educational attainment.
On average, women full-time, year-round workers with a high school education will earn less than $1 million from ages 25 to 64 years.
This compares to work-life earnings of $1.3 million for women with an associate's degree and $1.6 million for women with a bachelor 's degree The educational payoff is most noticeable at the highest educational levels.
Women full-time, year-round workers with a professional degree have the highest work-life earnings and may earn $2.9 million from ages 25 to 64 years.
Women full-time, year-round workers with a doctoral degree have estimated work-life earnings of $2.5 million.
Men earn more than women at each education level.
The earnings gap between the work-life earnings of women and men full-time, year-round workers is substantial.
Disparities in work-life earnings are greatest among workers with higher degrees.
Women full-time, year-round workers with a professional degree may expect to earn $1.9 million less from ages 25 to 64 years than men with the same level of educational attainment.
