Nick Choy Sentinel Managing Editor, State Public Affairs Office Oregon Army National Guard aircrews practice Ã¯Â¿Â½water dropsÃ¯Â¿Â½ in preparation for the upcoming Oregon fire season.
Pictured is a CH-47 Ã¯Â¿Â½ChinookÃ¯Â¿Â½ helicopter.
Throughout history, fire has both served mankind as a resource, and plagued him with destruction.
In Oregon, the wildfire season starts in earnest as the days grow long and temperatures rise.
Fighting on the front lines of the battle to protect both lives and property are the men and women of the Oregon Air and Army National Guard.
The two Army National Guard Aviation units; the 1042nd, based in Salem, and Detachment 1-Delta 113th based in Pendleton; work alongside other National Guard units, the Bureau of Land Management, US Forest Service,Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Oregon Department of Forestry, as well as other state and federal agencies in order to protect lives and property from wild fires.
The Det. 1-113th utilizes CH-47 Ã¯Â¿Â½ChinooksÃ¯Â¿Â½ while the 1042nd uses UH-60 Ã¯Â¿Â½Blackhawk helicoptersÃ¯Â¿Â½, and one UH-60 Ã¯Â¿Â½FirehawkÃ¯Â¿Â½, a speciallymodified Blackhawk designed specifically to help fight fires.
According to aircrews, the work is challenging, and sometimes dangerous.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ You have an 18,000-pound bucket of water under a 30,000-pound helicopter, Ã¯Â¿Â½ says 113th helicopter instructor pilot Chief Warrant Officer Michael Bennett.
Ã¯Â¿Â½YouÃ¯Â¿Â½re doing all this and youÃ¯Â¿Â½re fighting crosswinds... itÃ¯Â¿Â½s risky business.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Typically, after a forest fire has been detected, the Emergency Operations Center in Salem contacts the State Aviation Officer, who in turn calls the National Guard units on rotation.
Air crews, who are on call throughout the fire season, always have their gear packed for field duty, and can report to the fire base within 24 hours after receiving the call.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We are normally the second call after the civilian agencies,Ã¯Â¿Â½ says Bennett.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We provide quick response and fillin.
They call us because they need the support immediately, and since we are a local asset, a lot of the time weÃ¯Â¿Â½re the first ones there.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Once on scene, Aircrews are met by support personnel, aviation mechanics, and refueling personnel from their unit.
Pre-flight briefings inform crews what part they will play in the mission, and to whom they will report.
All ground operations are overseen by an Aviation See "Firefighting: A Real-World Mission" on Pg. 15 Letters From the Desert;
Bravo Co. 52 Engineers and 82 ROC in Iraq Citizen Soldiers Write of Challenges and Accomplishments Members of the Oregon National Guard were mobilized in early 2002 -- along with their full-time counterparts -- and forward deployed to theaters of operations throught Iraq.
While accounts of the campaign reported back to an eager population in the states were facilitated by "embedded journalists" working for Associated Press, United Press International, CNN, and other news agencies, some information came through less-formal, and indeed more basic avenues -- letters and e-mail to family and friends sent from military troops on the ground in Iraq.
The Oregon Sentinel would like to share with you some of these poignant and touching letters from our citizen soldiers.
Please see page 14 for the photo montage and text.

Spring 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 2 Command Focus As we go to press with the first edition of the Oregon Sentinel, the major combat operations have officially ended in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but both theaters of operations are very dangerous environments for our military members and the civilians who are serving our nationÃ¯Â¿Â½s interests.
Currently, the Oregon National Guard is represented in Southwest Asia by the soldiers in the 82 nd Rear Operations Center; B Company, 52 nd Engineers; and 1 st Battalion, 162nd Infantry.
They are doing an outstanding job while performing very demanding missions.
Please keep these soldiers and their families in your thoughts and prayers until they can return home safely.
If you hear of any special concerns from the families or employers of our deployed soldiers, do not hesitate to let the Military Department know.
Since the commencement of hostilities with Iraq, we have been heavily involved in the missions that have been directed by our National Command Authority.
We have Air Guard personnel from the 173rd and 142nd Fighter Wings all over the world.
In addition, the 641st Medical Battalion is assigned to Ft. Bragg, and the 1249 th Engineer Battalion is preparing to perform force protection missions at numerous locations in the Northwest.
May they all come home safely when their missions are complete.
We are proud of each and every one of them.
On another note, the training requirements for the remainder of our units must still be accomplished.
The annual training cycle is upon us again.
I urge each of you to get as much completed to standard as you can.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ our future depends on maintaining a welltrained force.
But always remember safety must be first and foremost in your minds at all times.
I look forward to visiting as many training sites as possible.
In the next few years, you will see and hear about the many events designed to commemorate the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
As the bicentennial of their Oregon explorations approach, we will be directly involved in educating the public on the accomplishments of their journey.
The future holds many challenges for our Armed Forces as a whole.
The concept of Homeland Security will dictate a somewhat different approach to defending our nation than we have witnessed in the past.
We may see a few new organizations formed, but the basic missions of the National Guard will not change.
We will train to Air Force and Army standards in order to effectively respond to any contingency.
At the state level, we are on a course to develop a true joint headquarters.
The long-term vision includes a From the Editor Welcome to the premiere issue of The Oregon Sentinel.
We have instituted several design changes, as well as unveil a brand new masthead.
As always, we strive to bring you the most up-todate news, stories, and feature articles from your National Guard units across the state, nation, and world.

Transformation is an overused word in our daily lexicon as members of the 21st century fighting force that is todayÃ¯Â¿Â½s A i r National Guard, but in Oregon, we are seeing a transformation in our daily lives.
At the recent Adjutant GeneralÃ¯Â¿Â½s Conference, Oregon, like all Chief Master Sgt. J. Wayne Stuart, other states and Command Chief Master Sergant U.S. territories, received initial guidance from our new Director of the National Guard Bureau, Army Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum, to begin transforming into a joint posture no later than the first day of fiscal year 2004 (Oct. 1st).
In order to streamline operational excess while preserving our focus and maintaining unity of command, the plan is to create joint forces headquarters out of the Air, Army and Adjutant General Staffs that exist in most National Guard organizations.
Oregon is once again ahead of the curve as we were already deep into this transition, with many Air and Army roles already mutually supportive.
At the command staff in Salem, the Air Guard has received a new voice of leadership with the promotion of Brigadier General Wayne Green to the position of Joint Chief of Staff, Oregon Joint Forces Command.
Green is a troop-focused leader with experience and competence that is well known throughout the Pacific Northwest.
His addition to the senior staff will prove invaluable to the citizen airmen and soldiers of the Oregon National Guard.
On another note, the 142nd Wing was just recognized for its excellence in flying over 60,000 hours incident-free.
This extraordinary accomplishment is the first time that any National Guard wing has reached this milestone.
Not only was Oregon Air National Guard the first wing to be 100% stood up on September 11th, 2001, we continue to set the example in our unmatched safety record.
Way to go, Redhawks! I t Ã¯Â¿Â½s Summer, and already weÃ¯Â¿Â½ve received tragic news of citizensoldiers allowing their standards of safety to slacken.
Two soldiers were killed recently in a single-vehicle traffic accident just outside an armory in North Portland Meanwhile in the Persian Gulf, a member of Bravo Company, 52nd Engineers was Command Sgt. Maj. Donald F. seriously injured in Newman, State Command Sergant a traffic incident Major while the convoy tried to avoid deadly sniper fire.
Regardless of the location or circumstances, safety must be our number one concern.
It is not a matter of adding a Ã¯Â¿Â½SafetyÃ¯Â¿Â½ paragraph to our orders process, nor is it an issue that can be summarized in a column of this paper.
It is a process that must be integrated into the way we view our roles as citizen-soldiers and airmen of the Oregon National Guard and as the fighting arm of the National Command Authority.
Think and plan before you get behind the wheel so that we all might avoid making a terrible mistake.
Not since the Second World War have we seen this kind of military operations tempo.
Oregon National Guard members are securing the ports of Kuwait, escorting convoys in and out of Baghdad, maintaining the flow of logistical support into the Iraqi theater, rebuilding infrastructure in a war-torn land, and managing and executing medical evacuation tasking at Fort Bragg.
Closer to home, we are keeping the skies and bases of the Pacific Northwest secure by supporting the Homeland Security mission, Noble Eagle II, and weÃ¯Â¿Â½re preparing for another potentially brutal fire season with fire-suppression training for our helicopter crews and fire fighter training for our soldiers on the ground.
The new State Readiness Center is now open for business unifying our assets in order to provide the Governor a centralized control platform for directing emergency operations.
Oregon has met the call to serve and is performing far beyond expectations.
We are living up to our motto, "When we are needed, we are there."
LetÃ¯Â¿Â½s continue to do so through a mindset of safety.

Most of the time, rescue cr ews ar rive on scene to find injur ed or missing persons, and at times, worse.
So it's no surprise that when a distress call or missing persons report ends on a happy note, there comes a feeling of celebration and gratitude.
But like many rescuers, Oregon's Search And Rescue teams remain unsung heroes, knowing that a job well-done is thanks enough.
Recently, a 1042nd sear ch and rescue cr ew were dispatched to locate an overdue boating party on the Illinois River in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness ar ea of the Siskiyou Mountains located in Southwest Oregon.
What follows is a letter of appreciation from a member of that group.
A 1042nd Air Ambulance flight medic is winched back onboard after checking on the boaters.
"We were safe and well when the Blackhawk crew found us at approximately 1300 hours just downstream of the mouth of the Collier Creek on the Curry County side of the Illinois River.
We were scheduled to reach the Oak Flat take-out on Friday, April 25, but several days of rain had raised the river levels.
Because of high water combined with cold weather, we elected to remain camped at Deadman Bar about four miles above the Green Wall section of the Illinois River until the weather improved or the river level d ropped.
The Del Norte County (California) Search and Rescue was notifed that we were overdue on Saturday, and initiated the search that eventually brought the Oregon Guard helicopter.
The Green Wall is the largest rapid on the Illinois River and has the potential to flip a raft.
Below the Green Wall are several other rapids that are also difficult to negotiate when the river is flowing heavily.
Although we had six kayakers in the party in addition to the single raft, the success of the trip depends on the ability to get all members in the party safely through all the rapids.
Even though the water level on Monday was as high or slightly higher than on Friday, the weather was considerably better, which improved our ability to get the raft down the Green Wall.
We were fairly sure someone would be dispatched to look for us after we were several days late.
We were essentially out of food, and would have An Army National Guard UH-60 Blackhawk prepares to drop off a crewmember to check on an overdue boating party in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness Area of Southwest Oregon.
been in real need of supplies had we not been able to travel out on Monday.
We would like to thank the National Guard for their efforts.
It was truly a wonderful sight to watch the skilled pilot and crew perform their jobs.
When we asked the sergant who dropped down to us where they had come from, he said Salem, but that they had been in Afganistan on Friday.
We were astounded and honored to be able to talk to someone who had been in harm's way so recently and who had come home safely.
He assured us there was no place in Afganistan as beautiful as an Oregon river in springtime.
We did not get the name of the sergeant with whom we spoke, nor the names of the rest of the crew but we hope you will express our deepest gratitude to them and our pride in the Oregon National Guard."
Sincerely, Aida Parkinson McKinleyville, California Copies of this letter were also sent by Ms. Parkinson to the State Public Affairs Officer, Maj. Arnold Strong, State Rep. Mike Thompson (D), 1st District, Calif., and Congressman Peter DeFazio, (D), 4th District, Ore.
Members of the rescue crew that day included; Chief Wa r rant Officers 3rd Class Bill Wilkins and Earl Poole as the pilot and co-pilot team, Crew Chief Sgt.
Mark Carter, and flight medic Sgt. Troy Waddell on the hoist.
I am sure that I speak for the pilots and crew in telling you that the honor was theirs as they are men and women that truly love doing their jobs.
And although we know that `getting the job done' is always thanks enough, when someone writes a heart-felt letter like this, it's like... well, icing on the cake.
Awesome job guys... keep up the great work.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ed. "Singing Patriot" Answers Important Call to Society and Country By Spc. Luke Elliot 115th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment Lake Oswego, Ore.--Serving the community is not a new concept for Sgt. Daniel I. Johnson, of the 82nd Rear Operation Cell (ROC).
During the normal workweek, Johnson serves as a state trooper for the Oregon State Police.
Each evening he goes home and devotes time to his wife and eight children.
On Sundays, he is active in his church, and also attends drills as a Sgt. Daniel I. Johnson sings the StarSpangled Banner at 82nd ROC Activation Ceremony. soldier in the Oregon National Guard.
Nearly every aspect of JohnsonÃ¯Â¿Â½s life involves service to others, but in February, Johnson began a new era of service; marked by his voice, and the singing of the national anthem at the activation ceremony of the 82nd ROC.
Like many others in the National Guard, Johnson has been called to serve in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
Singing the Star Spangled Banner was just the beginning of what could be up to a one year tour for Johnson and the rest of his peers from the ROC.
He doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t take his duty lightly and he knows the freedoms echoed in Francis Scott KeyÃ¯Â¿Â½s words donÃ¯Â¿Â½t come without sacrifice.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s not a light thing when youÃ¯Â¿Â½re asked to render the Star Spangled Banner to your peers,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Johnson.
Ã¯Â¿Â½So, I took it seriously, like raising the flag or saluting a senior officer Ã¯Â¿Â½ it was a service for the families and the troops to encourage and motivate them to do their jobs to the best of their ability while reminding us all, including myself, that we have a great nation and should never abuse our freedoms, because they didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t come without sacrifice.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Johnson, an advocate of homeland defense, views Operation Enduring Freedom as a civic responsibility he wants to live up to.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ WeÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been attacked at home, and I believe that our families, friends and coworkers deserve protection,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Johnson.
Ã¯Â¿Â½They deserve to be represented well in the effort to dealwith an aggressive force of terrorism.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Johnson and the 82nd ROC, left Oregon in February for Ft. Lewis, Washington.
Despite future uncertainties, Johnson maintains a positive attitude and finds comfort in the knowledge that heÃ¯Â¿Â½ll be in good company.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ WeÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been called and activated,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Johnson.
Ã¯Â¿Â½IÃ¯Â¿Â½m honored to go wherever IÃ¯Â¿Â½m needed Ã¯Â¿Â½ especially with the troops IÃ¯Â¿Â½m with.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Johnson, like many other soldiers, was transferred from a different unit to join the 82nd ROC for the deployment.
The adjustment wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t as difficult as he first envisioned; many of the soldiers in the 82nd ROC, already knew him.
Capt. Scott D. Farish, a planning officer for the 82ndROC, felt Johnson and his Ã¯Â¿Â½can- doÃ¯Â¿Â½ attitude was a positive addition to the unit.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s his nature to serve Ã¯Â¿Â½ he is the type of person who is always trying to help people,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Farish said.
Though service and caring for people are at the forefront of JohnsonÃ¯Â¿Â½s core values, he doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t feel they conflict with the idea of defense or his involvement with the National Guard.
Instead, he believes they are analogous to each other.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Just because youÃ¯Â¿Â½re a peaceful and caring person, doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t mean you canÃ¯Â¿Â½t defend against forces that would or could disrupt that peace,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Johnson said.
Johnson likens the desire for peace and his warrior spirit to the definition of meekness.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Some people think the word meekness means weakness, but meekness means something different Ã¯Â¿Â½ meekness is to have your mind and physical ability ready and waiting for a lawful order,Ã¯Â¿Â½ says Johnson.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ThatÃ¯Â¿Â½s what being in the National Guard is all aboutÃ¯Â¿Â½ being well-trained, prepared and willing to act when the lawful order comes.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The lawful order came for Johnson just as it has for many other citizensoldiers throughout Oregon.
With the United States involved in conflict in the Middle East, soldiers continue to step up to the plate, putting on a uniform that represents social responsibility Ã¯Â¿Â½ a responsibility Johnson and his peers take seriously.
Ã¯Â¿Â½This is our Country.
This is our backyard.
Somebody comes in my backyard thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s not welcome, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m gonna have to ask them to leave,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Johnson.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ThatÃ¯Â¿Â½s essentially what weÃ¯Â¿Â½re doing here.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Spring 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 4 Oregonians Support Troops During Iraqi Campaign .
Oregon citizens, including retired military personnel, gather at the State Capital in Salem, Ore. last March to show their support for American troops fighting for freedom and democracy in Iraq.
Community Joins Forces to Rally Support for Troops and Families Photos and story by Staff Sgt. Rebekah-mae N. Bruns 41st Brigade Public Affairs Salem, Ore.
Masses swarmed the streets of the Capitol last March with jutting placards as shouts and poignant cries filled the cool Oregon air.
No, it was not an anti-war protest.
Instead, people from around the state gathered for a growing movement known as Ã¯Â¿Â½Support Our Troops.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In a rally that assembled nearly 2,000 citizens, shouts of Ã¯Â¿Â½Support our TroopsÃ¯Â¿Â½ and Ã¯Â¿Â½Liberate Iraq,Ã¯Â¿Â½ were An unidentified woman supports US military by wrapping herself in a US flag. heard throughout an infectious and colossal crowd of people on the steps of the StateÃ¯Â¿Â½s capitol in Salem, Ore. just following the start of the Iraq campaign in March.
The movement, intended to avert a possible backlash similar to the ones experienced during the Vietnam era, was created to show troops that American citizens stand behind them during their campaign in Iraq.
The movement swept across the country just before the onset of the war, as committed supporters showed servicemen and women they were anxious to offer their assistance in any way they can.
Despite the overall success and popular support of the rally, there were other citizens who showed up to voice their dissent of war and U.S. policy.
Gathering outside the robust crowd of supporters, anti-war protesters brought signs with proclamations such as, Ã¯Â¿Â½Not in my name,Ã¯Â¿Â½ and Ã¯Â¿Â½Peace is patriotic.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Confrontations arose between the two crowds but ended in small groups of general discussions with both sides giving argument for their choices.
Ã¯Â¿Â½They have a right to their opinion , but they need to realize they are putting soldiers at risk,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Phillip Ramsdell, an organizer of the Salem event.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Anti-war protests make Saddam feel that if he holds out, they will change policy instead of complying with disarmament.Ã¯Â¿Â½ When Ramsdell personnel discovered the 1249th Engineer Battalion, an Oregon Army National Guard battalion approximately 450 strong headquartered in Salem, Ore., was being activated and deployed to an undisclosed location in support of the Global War on Terror, he made it his mission to ensure the unitÃ¯Â¿Â½s well-being.
He plans to help the community support the deployment in a meaningful way.
Ã¯Â¿Â½A lot of people say they support our troops but supporting our troops does not mean just waving the flag,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Ramsdell.
Ã¯Â¿Â½It means supporting them financially, supporting them with our hearts and supporting them with our prayers.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Realizing there can sometimes be a large disparity between a service member Ã¯Â¿Â½s income from the civilian sector and their military pay, citizens donated over $2,800 in an effort to help soldiers and their families with possible looming financial problems.
The money, which is intended to ease financial burdens for deployed service members so they can focus their attention on the war effort without distraction, will become part of an emergency relief fund and will be administered by the 1249 th Engineer Battalion Family Program.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We have not Supporters wave established a limit to ployed to Iraq.
what the family can get out of this fund,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Ramsdell.
Ã¯Â¿Â½It is based on need and there is flexibility unlike the state fund cap of $150.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½When they hear their families are being taken care of, they are going to know thereÃ¯Â¿Â½s real commitment and sacrifice behind this and that itÃ¯Â¿Â½s not just the flag going up.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Oregon citizens have offered other types of assistance as well.
Child care, home repairs, telephone cards and letters are just of few of the ways our citizens are helping.

Shots rang out across Camp Rilea as the Adjutant Generals Match began its annual competition Ã¯Â¿Â½ and what has become a nerve cell for the National GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s finest shooters.
Master Sgt. Jeff Arnst, an organizer of the event, sees the little-publicized match as a gold mine for fast paced, combat oriented training.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ YouÃ¯Â¿Â½re doing the type of firing that you would do in combat,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Arnst.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s snap exposure where an individual needs to fire a few quick shots.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The competition is comprised of three main categories, the machine gun, 9mm pistol and the rifle.
Subsequently, each Battalion in the state is allotted a group consisting of four members each for the pistol and rifle competitions, and two members for the machine gun team.
Fifty- percent of the aforementioned elements must be new attendees to the AdjutantÃ¯Â¿Â½s Match.
Ã¯Â¿Â½This is how we keep new shooters coming to the match,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Arnst.
The annual state competition is just the beginning for some.
Top shooters are asked to advance to the national level to compete at the Winston P. Wilson match held in Little Rock, Arkansas, and may move on to the international level to compete on the All Guard Team.
As the United States continues to carry out its mission on the Global War on Terror, marksman skills for soldiers like Staff Sgt. Kevin Maries, carry even greater importance.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ You are introduced to new shooting techniques and positions that are not practiced for the yearly qualification,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Maries.
Ã¯Â¿Â½If I were activated I would hope the guy next to me would possess the type of advanced Staff Sgt, Alan Ezelle takes aim in the 9mm catagory at the Adjutant Generals Match.

marksmanship skills that this competition teaches.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some of those techniques include shooting at varying distances with different types of multiple targets, targets that are realistic interpretations of enemy soldiers.
Moreover, shooters get the opportunity to fire at moving targets from the kneeling, sitting and prone positions, all of which are meant to create a more realistic setting for the soldier.
In a world of advanced technology, Arnst recognizes that not all battle can be conducted by computers or high tech systems of weaponry.
In the end, Arnst feels battle still comes down to the service member and his or her markmanship skills.
Ã¯Â¿Â½A skilled marksman would have a higher probability of a firts time hit,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Arnst.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The final element of any decisive engagement is the ability of soliders to put accurate and deadly small arms fire on target.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Shooters line up on the 9mm course.

You grab a copy of the Oregon Sentinel, and you see a story, complete with photos and cutlines, on something you recently took part in, or better yet Ã¯Â¿Â½ something your unit recently completed.
As public affairs personnel, we strive to tell the soldiersÃ¯Â¿Â½ stories, but the fact of the matter is there are too many events and guardmembers for us to cover.
With just a handful of public affairs personnel and nearly 9,000 soldiers and airmen living across the state, we are in need of assistance from the units.
The adjutant general is endorsing a program to encourage each unit to pick a responsible, dedicated guardmember to represent each unit.
Some mistakenly believe the roles and responsibilities of a public affairs representative in their unit, or UPAR, would be too much work on top of an already full lists of duties.
A fully operating UPAR position can be very demanding, but the plan is to start training and encouraging UPARs to write internal stories about their units and the soldiers and airmen within them.
As the program develops across the state, UPARs can seek additional training to enhance other missions.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The UPARÃ¯Â¿Â½s primary responsibility is to feed content and issues up to the public affairs office at the state headquarters,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Maj. Arnold Strong, state public affairs officer.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The key is that we in the state public affairs office receive so little input from the units that our publication often comes across looking like a Ã¯Â¿Â½FlagpoleÃ¯Â¿Â½ edition, focusing too much on issues affecting the command and headquarters while not accurtately reflecting the hard work of soldiers in the field.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Other skills UPAR personnel will learn about in the future are crafting press releases for the units, communicating the successes of commands and interacting with the media, according to the National Guard UPAR Handbook.
Enlisted soldiers are exactly what the command needs for the UPAR program, according to an Oregon training video, Ã¯Â¿Â½Unit PA Training: Setting up a PA ProgramÃ¯Â¿Â½.
Other suggestions for picking a UPAR are to choose someone willing to dedicate two to three years to the program and pick someone who is mature and responsible.
Perhaps some feel that having a public affairs representative would not benefit their unit.
Over time the benefits will become clear as you realize you canÃ¯Â¿Â½t avoid public affairs.
Whether dealing with members of your unit or the community, public affairs is all around you.
ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s an all-encompassing effort with a principle goal of ensuring your unit is well accepted and supported in the community, according to the handbook.
Having an effective UPAR program will help establish and maintain good will and public acceptance Ã¯Â¿Â½ essential for your unit to be combat ready and successful.
Having a UPAR in a unit also provides the unit some internal benefits.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Unit Public Affairs representatives make a vital difference to the units they serve by enabling their commanders to highlight the success of their organiza- tions while remaining operationally focused,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Strong.
The UPAR also serves as a link between the command and the community.
Every guardmember should understand the importance of handling internal and external information and the importance of getting this information out to our audiences.
This is the reason public affairs is organizing the UPAR program and is requesting at least one person per unit to attend training to become their unitÃ¯Â¿Â½s public affairs representative.
This representative could be you.
It has been said that the pen is mightier than sword.
However, as long as youÃ¯Â¿Â½re uniform, you will never permanently turn in this proverbial sword for pen, but if you join the UPAR program, you might experience the power of wielding both.

By Maj. Mike Allegre Public Affairs Officer, HQ, ORANG PORTLAND, Ore.Ã¯Â¿Â½ It was the first promotion of its kind in the Oregon Air National Guard.
On March 6, 2003, Deborah C. Messecar became the first female promoted to the rank of colonel in the history of the Oregon Air National Guard.
Messecar, commander of the 142nd Medical Group, has been an ORANG member and assigned to the unit since October 1982 when she joined as a nurse.
She later became the unitÃ¯Â¿Â½s chief nurse.
She accepted command in June 2002, overseeing over 70 members including four fulltime personnel.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Accepting the command of the 142 Medical Group has been the biggest challenge I have ever accepted in my professional life.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Said Col. Messecar.
The 142nd Fighter Wing is among only 29 Air National Guard units named to receive the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (AFOUA).
The award period covers October 1, 2000 - September 30, 2002.
The last time the Wing was awarded the AFOUA was 1991.
Current Guardmembers assigned during the period covered will be eligible to wear the award.
In Fiscal Year 2001 the unit flew 2921 sorties for 4113 hours, far exceeding all other ANG F-15 units.
The unit responded to the September 11th terrorist attacks by generating 14 fully combat-configured aircraft in 20 hours, setting a timeline never before seen by the National Guard Bureau.
Elements conducted 46 deployments involving 1,125 personnel to 15 exercises and operations within the United States and nine foreign countries.
The Wing continued to support Operation Noble Eagle exceeding all mission capability rate standards.
Total Force Found Effective Korean Wa r Remembered Airmen Work Together to Complete Mission By Airman 1st Class David Jackson 40th Air Expeditionary Wing, Public Affairs Office Pilots Reminisce War, Catch up on History By Capt. Misti Mazzia 142nd Fighter Wing, Public Affairs Officer The six-person 40th Expeditionary Civil Engineer SquadronÃ¯Â¿Â½s (CES) Explosive Ordnance Disposal team proves every day that the Air ForcesÃ¯Â¿Â½ Total Force Concept does work.
Comprised of two Air Force Reservists, two active-duty members and two Air National Guardsmen, the team has been working since May 28 at an operating location in support of the U.S. Central Command execution of Operation Enduring Freedom.
However, having worked together at Holloman AFB, N.M. before the deployment, they werenÃ¯Â¿Â½t strangers to each other.
Staff Sgts.
Tod Peterson and Ralph Godfrey, both members of the Oregon Air National GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s 142nd Fighter Wing, arrived at Holloman to help the understaffed 49th Civil Engineer SquadronÃ¯Â¿Â½s EOD flight.
And with an upcoming unit compliance inspection, the two staff sergeants had to do it quick.
Ã¯Â¿Â½When Staff Sgt. Peterson and I arrived at Holloman, they were down to a skeleton crew of people,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Godfrey.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Peterson and I went to work right away, fitting ourselves into their operations.
There was very little time to figure out what was different about them and us.
We had a job to do and we did it.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Staff Sgts.
Guy Heard and Luana Krueger, 944th Civil Engineer Squadron, Luke AFB, Ariz., arrived later to provide even more help.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The reservists had even less time and were huge assets at inspection time,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Godfrey continued.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We did great, especially considering we had a crew that had worked together for less than three weeks.Ã¯Â¿Â½ After assisting at Holloman, the reservists, guardsmen, and Master Sgt. Kenney Wessels and Staff Sgt. Ronald Wilson, both members of the 49th CES, deployed overseas.
Since their arrival, the EOD team has responded to several munitions calls, demonstrating how the Total Force concept works.
Ã¯Â¿Â½This proves that guardsmen, reservists and active duty people can come together and support the mission,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Peterson.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The Air Force built this concept a long time ago and we are proof it can work,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Godfrey said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We are doing the same job, to the same standards that every EOD unit around the world is doing.Ã¯Â¿Â½ PORTLAND, Ore.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The Portland Air National Guard honored Korean War Veterans on May 24th, commemorating the 50th anniversary and dedication ceremony at the Memorial Garden.
The ceremony opened with an invocation by Father Alfred Williams and was hosted by Col. Garry Dean, 142nd Fighter Wing commander.
Maj. Gen. Alexander Burgin spoke about the history of the Korean War and the lessons learned.
He then introduced Ernie Wakehouse, a former Redhawk and one of only nine pilots from the Portland Air Base deployed to Korea.
Wakehouse spoke about his combat missions, and related how he narrowly cheated death several times.
Wakehouse flew 100 sorties in the P-51 Mustang providing close air support for ground forces from September to December 1951, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and six Air Medals for his courage and skill.
Chief Master Sgt.
Jack Klein, formerly with the 142nd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron deployed to Alaska during the Korean Conflict, referenced some of the conditions and challenges of being deployed there.

Dignitaries and veterans helped unveil and dedicate a memorial stone weighing almost 3 tons.
The Camas gray basalt stands 4 feet tall, and is 4 feet wide at the base.
The memorial stone resembles the contour of Mt. Hood and was shaped and polished by local artist Mark McLean.
A four-ship F-15 flyover salute was a fitting conclusion to the service.
A reunion and luncheon following the ceremony was held at the Columbia Pointe Club, where Korean War veterans and their families had an opportunity to reminisce and catch up with each other.
Spring 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 7 142nd FW Flies 60,000 Mishap-Free Hours; Achieves Milestone Through Teamwork By Capt. Misti Mazzi Public Affairs Officer, 142nd Fighter Wing POR TLAND, Or e.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The 142 nd Fighter Wing, also known as OregonÃ¯Â¿Â½s Red Hawks, recently attained an impressive safety milestone of 60,000 mishap-free flying hours.
The unit has been flying F-15s for 14 years and has the oldest fleet in the Air ForceÃ¯Â¿Â½s inventory.
Ã¯Â¿Â½This (safety) milestone is a testament to the amount of flying we do,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Col. Garry Dean, 142 FW commander.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s also a tribute to the professionalism and passion our people have for their military mission, here and abroad.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Each year, fighter pilots from the 142 FW fly 3000+ training sorties and log more than 4200 flight hours.
Many of these same pilots and jets have also flown patrol missions in support of Operations Northern and Southern Watch, both of which are NATO-based military campaigns used to provide aerial surveillance and defense of the no-fly zones in Iraq
.
According to 142 FW Safety Officer Lt. Col. Kyle Hook, an impeccable safety record like the one set by the 142 FW doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t just happen.
It takes a strong work ethic and many people working toward the same goal to achieve this degree of success.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Every individual here, since day one, has been doing the right thing everyday, the right way, Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Hook.
Ã¯Â¿Â½This achievement is a team effortÃ¯Â¿Â½.
This team, he added, consists not only of first-rate fighter pilots, but also of aircraft maintainers and a host of support personnel throughout the organization.
Given the age of the F-15 fleet at the Portland Air Base (the oldest aircraft is 30 years old), itÃ¯Â¿Â½s no doubt aircraft maintenance personnel have their daily work cut out for them.
But, according to Lt. Col. Gary Eckert (142 FW logistics group commander), itÃ¯Â¿Â½s a challenge the maintainers have lived up to with overwhelming success.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Our logistics group is home to over 525 talented professionals achieving monumental results in maintenance,Ã¯Â¿Â½ commented Eckert.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Our Ã¯Â¿Â½fully mission capable rateÃ¯Â¿Â½ is over 80% while the ANG standard is 66%.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Without a doubt, itÃ¯Â¿Â½s a record the 142 FW can be proud of.Ã¯Â¿Â½ He added.

Strong, State Public Affairs Officer, Sentinel Editor-in-Chief Photos by members of the 1042nd Medical Company Kandahar, Afghanistan and Salem, Ore. - They came from almost the exact opposite side of the planet and represented all walks of American life: students, paramedics, civil servants, postal workers, but when the citizen soldiers of the 1042d Medical Company (Air Ambulance) received the order to deploy to Operation Enduring Freedom in April of 2002, the unit deployed at 100% strength and immediately into harmÃ¯Â¿Â½s way in Afghanistan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
April 25th, 2003, the first elements of the 1042d to return from the combatant theater touched down at their home base of Salem, Ore., to the cheers, hugs and jubilation of an ecstatic audience offamily members, friends, and community leaders.
They were finally home.
Their journey was hardly a swift one.
After serving in Bosnia for almost a year of continuous operation involving routine medical evacuation and search and rescue missions, the unit was again activated less than 18 months later to reinforce the efforts of the 44th Medical Command from Fort Bragg, NC.

Once certified for combatant operations, the crews of the 1042nd took up their positions in Kandahar Air Field, and Bagram Air Base, Afghani stan.
Additional crews flew to Camp Doha, Kuwait, and Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia.
The Headquarters Detachment, responsible to track all logistical support for the deployed elements while supporting Fort Bragg air ambulance requirements, remained there throughout the deployment.
Ã¯Â¿Â½So I think the hardest thing IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve had to InAfghanistan, the they served in numerous locations but were based out of Bagram and Kandahar.
Between the two major cities of the country, the unit forward deployed two UH-60L Black Hawks to Forward Operating Base Salerno (FOB).
During the time the unit was stationed at Salerno, the 18th Airborne Corps Commander, Lt. Gen. McNeil, deployed a Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne to the area.
At the time of deployment, there was little left of the former academic center than Ã¯Â¿Â½thugs with guns ruling the streets,Ã¯Â¿Â½ according to McNeil.
Within a month of their deployment, the 82nd had confiscated all weapons in the Kowst Bowl Region and helped to reopen two elementary schools.
Within two months, commerce had returned to the streets and women and children were allowed free passage without harassment.
By the third month, the unit had helped to initiate the re-opening of two centers of higher learning, trade was there was an almost drop cessation of crime in the streets.
During this same period o 1042nd performed more than 90 missions saving in excess of 130 patients to include civilians.

Like its civilian counterparts, the TRICARE Management Activity implemented the privacy portion of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by th April 14 complaince deadline.
The act, which Congress passed in 1994 and became public law 04-131m was designed to Ã¯Â¿Â½combat waste, fraud and abuse, improve portability of health insurance coveragem and simplify administration of health care,Ã¯Â¿Â½ according to a TRICARE brochure issued in January.
Laws that were already on the books, such as the Privacy Act, have always protected patientsÃ¯Â¿Â½ medical information, but HIPAA informs individuals of wha their rights are and TRICAREÃ¯Â¿Â½s responsibilities to protect health information, which hasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t been done in the past.
TRICARE mailed more than five million notices to beneficiaries homes between December 2002 and March 2003.
The notices are also available at military treatment facilities.
Besides explaining the patients rights under HIPPA and TRICAREÃ¯Â¿Â½s responsibilities, the notice tells beneficiaries how to file a complaint if they feel their health information has been inappropriately used.
Patients should contact the military treatment facility privacy officers or the TRICARE privacy officer.
They can also go directly to the Department of Health and Human Services office of Civil Rights Website and follow the complaint and inquiry process at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hippa/ Log onto http://www.military.com/ for general information on TRICARE.

Due to the weather, finish times were slower than normal for the elite runners.
Even though Dudley won the race with a very respectable time he was well off his personal record of 2:14:37.
The weather coupled with the fact he missed eight weeks of training during January and February due to a stress fracture to his foot, prevented this elite runner from Batttalion crosses performing at peak level.
Dudley, who has been a member of the Guard since 1999 trained and ran with the ArmyÃ¯Â¿Â½s World Class Athlete Program.
He commented that Ã¯Â¿Â½for the first couple of miles I was cold because they delayed the start, but at about mile five I got into a rhythm and felt more comfortable.Ã¯Â¿Â½ This was quit evident as he beat the second place finisher by more than five minutes.

We worked hard and performed well, maybe next year we can beat Oregon.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Other states have been fielding faster teams and each year the competition gets stronger.
OregonÃ¯Â¿Â½s Max White stated Ã¯Â¿Â½our performance was great today.
We defended our team title and I think we can do it again next year.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Oregon runners earned individual honors as well as the National Guard team championship.
As the overall race winner Dudley was also the National Guard Champion and named to the 2003 National Guard Marathon Team.

Spring 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 12 Oregon Air Guard Teams With Evergreen Aviation to Transport SR-71 By Maj. Donna Prigmore HQ, ORANG, Public Affairs Officer Almost 30 years ago, LockheedÃ¯Â¿Â½s SR-71 Ã¯Â¿Â½BlackbirdÃ¯Â¿Â½ set the world air speed record, flying from New York to London Ã¯Â¿Â½ a distance of almost 3,500 miles Ã¯Â¿Â½ in just under two hours.
Recently, an SR-71 made a 950 mile trip from Southern California to McMinnville, Oregon in 96 hours.
But this time, it wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t flying, and it wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t all in one piece.
In late May, seven members from the Oregon Air National Guard (ORANG) headed to Edwards Air Force Base to load and haul the final segments (mainly the fuselage) of an SR-71 that is now officially on loan to Del SmithÃ¯Â¿Â½s EvergreenAviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon.
The fuselage, which arrived at the museum on May 4 after a four-night driving excursion led by ORANG volunteers, California Highway Patrol, and Oregon Incident Response personnel, met up with its original wings and engines, both of which were transported via the I-5 corridor last fall.
According to CMSgt.
John Rasmussen, a member of the ORANGÃ¯Â¿Â½s 142nd Logistics Group (LG), the SR-71 logistical feat was an all-volunteer project involving members from the 142 LG and 142nd Communications Flight and heavy equipment donations from local businesses.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The trucks were donated by the Diesel Service Unit and the trailers were donated by Extra Lease, both Portlandbased companies,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Rasmussen said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We work with both of these companies in our military jobs so we asked them to be involved,Ã¯Â¿Â½ he continued.
Over the past few months, four trips were made (involving six truckloads) from Southern California to Oregon in order to move the SR-71 to McMinnville.
The latest trip involved a tractor-trailer load that was 124 feet long (from the front of the truck to the end of the trailer), 23 feet wide, and weighing 22,000 pounds.
According to Rasmussen, this aviation-related logistics project was the fourth of its kind to be undertaken by volunteers of the 142 LG.
He quickly admits, however, that this one was the longest load theyÃ¯Â¿Â½ve ever transported and the most complex to plan.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The coordination was the hardest part since we were considered a Ã¯Â¿Â½superloadÃ¯Â¿Â½,Ã¯Â¿Â½ he explained.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We had to get permits in two states detailing when we would travel, where we would fuel, when and where we would pullover to sleep, etcÃ¯Â¿Â½.
Due to the size of the load, travel was only permitted along the I-5 corridor overnight; from 10 p.m. - 6 a.m.
To expedite the journey, the haul was transported at an average speed of 60 mph.
Ã¯Â¿Â½This was indeed a team project,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Rasmussen said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Everyone who participated brought something to it.Ã¯Â¿Â½ No one could have been happier with the ORANGÃ¯Â¿Â½s involvement than the people at Evergreen Aviation and their supporters, all of whom were onhand to witness the tractor-trailer load as it participated in a special parade the day the SR-71 fuselage arrived in Photo by SRA Ricky Best, 142CF/Multi-Media Tech.
Sgt. Leonard Pilger of the 142nd FW gives work crews a Ã¯Â¿Â½thumbs-upÃ¯Â¿Â½ as the SR71 fuselage is prepared for transport from Edwards AFB, Calif. to McMinnville, Ore.
McMinnville.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We canÃ¯Â¿Â½t say thank you enough to the Air Guard,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Nicole Wahlberg, director of marketing and public relations at Evergreen Aviation.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The SR71 is the 45th airplane in our inventory and weÃ¯Â¿Â½re very excited.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The museum houses the worldÃ¯Â¿Â½s largest aircraft, the Spruce Goose.
Made famous by Howard Hughes, the balsa wood behemoth has a wingspan the length of a football field including the end zones.
The World War II-vintage aircraft was designed to transport troops and tanks overseas but only officially flew one time in November 1947.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ With the SR-71 soon to be unveiled, our museum will be home to the biggest and the fastest aircraft ever made in the world,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Wahlberg.
A special fundraiser was held on June 6, where the fully assembled SR-71 was unveiled.
The airplane is now open to viewing by the general public.

Spring 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 13 Normandy Paratroopers Speak at Combat Engineers'Validation Ceremony Photo and story by Staff Sgt.
John Driscoll Unit Public Affairs Representative Ã¯Â¿Â½These paratroopers are great men not for what they did for themselves but for what they did for each other, Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Capt. Shaun P. Martin, following an address given by 1st Lt. Buck Compton and Sgt.
Donald Malarkey.
The deeds done by Compton and Malarkey when they parachuted into Normandy on June 6, 1944 and during the months that followed are described in Stephen AmbroseÃ¯Â¿Â½s Ã¯Â¿Â½Band Of BrothersÃ¯Â¿Â½ and are portrayed in an HBO miniseries of the same name.
Compton and Malarkey were keynote speakers at the ceremony the 1249th Engineer Battalion conducted three days prior to Memorial Day to commemorate the completion of its validation for deployment.
The ceremony was organized by Lt. Col. William Schutz, commander of the 1249th engineer battalion.
Ã¯Â¿Â½It is a very special day for our soldiers to be able to complete validation for combat and to meet with (L to R): Sgt.
Donald Malarkey (Ret.), Capt. Shaun P. Martin, 1st Lt. Buck Compton (Ret.). two American heroes of the Second World War,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Schutz.
The soldiers of the 1249th sat transfixed while transfixed while Compton and Malarkey described their experiences.
They spoke of the formation and training of Easy Company as well as its preparations in England prior to D-Day.
After parachuting into Normandy, Easy Company fought across France, participated in the Battle of the Bulge, and then advanced into Germany where they took HitlerÃ¯Â¿Â½s EagleÃ¯Â¿Â½s Nest Lair.
By the warÃ¯Â¿Â½s end 72% of Easy Company had been severely wounded.
All but four percent of the companyÃ¯Â¿Â½s members were awarded purple hearts.
Malarkey has ties to Fort Lewis and the Pacific Northwest.
He grew up in, and is still a resident of Astoria, Oregon.
He reported to Fort Lewis after being inducted into the Army and prior to reporting for parachute training.
Compton described Malarkey as the quintessential noncommissioned officer.
He said that he fought the war by proxy through Malarkey and his other NCOs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½They did what NCOs are supposed to do Ã¯Â¿Â½ they took chargeÃ¯Â¿Â½they never let me downÃ¯Â¿Â½they were tough,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Compton.
When the war ended Malarkey held Easy CompanyÃ¯Â¿Â½s record for the most consecutive days in combat.
Malarkey was awarded a Bronze Star for his service alongside Compton on June 6, 1944 at Brecourt Manor.
Compton also has ties to the West Coast.
Prior to World War II he was attending UCLA, where he competed in a Rose Bowl game and was also a member of the universityÃ¯Â¿Â½s baseball Sgt.

team.
Marley described Compton as an outstanding officer.
The assault lead by Compton on the guns at Brecourt Manor is still studied by military historians and professors.
Compton led 13 soldiers who took out a four-gun battery of 105mm howitzers.
The guns Compton destroyed were significantly interfering with the landing forces moving off Utah Beach on Causeway Number Two.
ComptonÃ¯Â¿Â½s 13-member team defeated 80 soldiers who were well dug in.
His actions at Brecourt Manor were the subject of a recently delivered series of seven lectures at West Point on the assault.
Compton said he had no recollections of his combat experience.
For his deeds at Brecourt Manor, Compton was awarded a Silver Star.
When Martin met Compton and Malarkey two generations of airborne combat experience came together.
Martin parachuted into Grenada with the 82nd Airborne, served in Panama, and in Desert Storm with the 82nd Airborne.
The soldiers of the 1249th were deeply moved by Malarkey and ComptonÃ¯Â¿Â½s low-key account of their experiences while serving with Easy Company.
Ã¯Â¿Â½It was fantastic to see living history.
It gave me a direct connection to events I had only read aboutÃ¯Â¿Â½for some of our soldiers were dipping across two generations,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Maj. Alan W. Boaz, 1249th EN BN Chaplain.
Ã¯Â¿Â½What they did was extraordinaryÃ¯Â¿Â½they were so low key about it,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Sgt. Calvin Nickell, a mechanic assigned to the 1249th EN BNÃ¯Â¿Â½s headquarters company.
The 1249th Engineer Battalion, was called to federal service on March 15th, mobilized for Operation Enduring Freedom.
Other Oregon Guard units are currently serving in Iraq.
Last month the 1249th EN BN was reassigned to a homeland security missions as part of Operation Noble Eagle III.
Oregon Guardmembers Help Festival Attendees Envision New Heights Photos and Story by Spec.
Luke Elliott, 115th Mobile Public Affairs Attachment As an estimated two million people gathered over an 11-day period at PortlandÃ¯Â¿Â½s Tom McCall Waterfront Park for the 2003 Portland Rose Festival, members of the Oregon National Guard spent that time helping people reach new heights on a Guard-sponsored rock climbing wall.
The mobile 25-foot wall in Downtown Portland, where climbers are protected by an automatic air-pressure belay, may not seem as exhilarating as free climbing the granite-faced playgrounds of Yosemite National Park, but for some this may be the first step to a new career and lifestyle with the Oregon National Guard.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s important for todayÃ¯Â¿Â½s young adults to learn about the many benefits the Guard has to offer,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Sgt. 1st Class Gregory N. Perez, recruiter and career counselor from the Oregon City Recruiting Office.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s not just about tanks and infantrymen, the Guard has a variety of other career fields that help people gain important knowledge and skills that will help them throughout life.Ã¯Â¿Â½ At least one career counselor was onsite every day at the festival to educate people interested in the Guard about the many educational and training benefits the organization offers.
They spoke with interested parties, and offered assistance in designing programs that meet individualsÃ¯Â¿Â½ career goals and lifestyles.
Moreover, Guardmembers like Perez can point out important benefits, be they education or training.
Ã¯Â¿Â½What weÃ¯Â¿Â½re doing out here isnÃ¯Â¿Â½t just about getting new recruits, itÃ¯Â¿Â½s about introducing the Guard and what we have to offer to the community.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Each weekday during the festival, about 300 people took the opportunity to meet the soldiers and test their own strength on the rock wall.
On the weekend, these numbers jumped to about 500 people per day.
Ã¯Â¿Â½While only some of the climbers are interested in joining the Guard, we are helping the community get to know us and see we are people-friendly,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Perez.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s important for people to learn that Guard members are a part of their communities.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sgt. Karl O. Wickstrom, cannon gunner for the 2nd Battalion, assists on the rock wall at PortlandÃ¯Â¿Â½s 2003 Rose Festival in Tom McCall Waterfront Park.
According to Perez, most of these soldiers donÃ¯Â¿Â½t work fulltime for the Guard.
Instead, they work in civilian jobs throughout the community.
ThatÃ¯Â¿Â½s how they get the name Ã¯Â¿Â½Citizen Soldiers.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Pfc. Jenne R. Wagner, who attended the festival, is a member of the 241st Military Intelligence Company.
Wagner, who works during the week as a waitress in the Portland area, is an example of this Ã¯Â¿Â½Citizen Soldier.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½I think itÃ¯Â¿Â½s important to have the Guard out here at Rose Festival,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Wagner.
Ã¯Â¿Â½If we donÃ¯Â¿Â½t make a conscious effort to show the public that we exist, then they will never know the sacrifices we make to protect our state and country.

According to Fetters, his entire chain of supervisors and many employees at UPSAT have gone to great lengths to demonstrate their support and have shown an overwhelmingly positive and understanding attitude toward his military commitments.
Ã¯Â¿Â½UPS Aviation Technologies has maintained my health insurance at no charge, offered financial assistance and extended offers of support and help to my family as circumstances have arisen,Ã¯Â¿Â½ explained Fetters.
Ã¯Â¿Â½I have received care packages during the holidays and Christmas cards signed by all the employees.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fetters, who is UPSAT Ã¯Â¿Â½s only employee in the ORANG admits having his employerÃ¯Â¿Â½s full support is extremely important to him as it helps ease the Ã¯Â¿Â½worry factor Ã¯Â¿Â½.
According to Fetters, he has been assured time and time again that he is missed and his job will be waiting for him when he returns from active duty.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We are very anxious to get him (Fetters) back but we are also very patient,Ã¯Â¿Â½ admitted Steve VanArsdale of UPSAT.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We all have things to do that we donÃ¯Â¿Â½t have control over, so we try to be as supportive as we can of him and his family.

Public Affairs Officer, 2nd Battery, 218th Field Artillery The mail seems to be the biggst concern to the soldiers.
They know the families are sending lots of letters and packages but they are very slow getting to the soldiers.
This is a theaterwide issue, not just Bravo Company.
Capt. Marcus Williams Commander, B-52 Engineers The Fire Support Ã¯Â¿Â½REDLEGSÃ¯Â¿Â½ of the 2-218th Field Artillery Battalion (2218th FA) are training with the artilleryÃ¯Â¿Â½s new fire support system, the M707 Knight System.
The Battalion Commander of the 2-218th FA, Lt. Col. DonnÃ¯Â¿Â½llA.
McBride noted Ã¯Â¿Â½This is a tremendous combat vehicle and the fire support soldiers are very excited about working with the new equipment.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Recently the 2-218th FA fielded the Knight System, one of the most modern targeting vehicles to support the combined arms commander of the 41st Separate Infantry Brigade (Enhanced).
According to the National Guard Association of the US legislative fact sheet dated April 19, 2002; Ã¯Â¿Â½The KNIGHT is a HMMWV-based targeting platform that acquires targets out to 10km with sufficient accuracy for Artillery fire missions; and designates moving targets to 3km and stationary targets to 5km for laser guided munitions.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The 2-218th field artillery 13F soldiers assigned to the teams are refining their fire support skills and getting used to the new Mission Training Plans (MTPs).

Don Ryan and Andrew Philpott have been spending their free time working out the bugs in the new system.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We are working hard to ensure this system will do what Brigade Commander needs it to do.Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Philpott.
All members of the Fire Support Teams (FIST) will have the opportunity to get to work with and understand how the equipment works.
The Mission of the Knight System is to perform 24-hour surveillance, target acquisition and location, mission execution to support brigade operations, designate targets for Laser Guided Ordnance, coordinate and execute timely, accurate fires for units in contact.
Several technological upgrades to this formidable targeting system will insure that the KNIGHT system has the mobility, survivability and signature equal or superior to the maneuver units it will support.

That is except when the air base is in desolate Afghanistan, where even simple tasks can be fraught with unwanted adventure.
Take laying cable in the ground, for example.
Both said that they found bones from the Soviet-Afghan war every time they dug a hole or a trench.
Such was life at Bagram Air Base in March, where a one-week mission can take a month.
But if not for the skills and ingenuity ofAnderson and Schmuhl, communications might have taken longer to establish.
The two are from the 224th Combat Communications Squadron.
They were with the 74th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron at another deployed location in March when the 74th and its A-10 Thunderbolt IIs were sent to Bagram to provide close air support.
Anderson and Schmuhl were responsible for networking, phones and ground radio at the departing base.
They were hand picked to set up communications for A-10s at Bagram but had no real picture of conditions there.
However, the adventure began before they even set foot in Afghanistan.
Since their departing base couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t support further forward deployment, especially communications support, Anderson and Schmuhl were forced to quickly improvise.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We had to beg, borrow and steal the networking and tactical phone equipment from other locations,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Schmuhl, the ground radio technician.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We had to take one radio from another location, scrounge the antennas, and repair another.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ They expected the original set-up would take just three to five days, but the mission lasted a month when delays and requests piled up.
Their first week included noncommunications work, such as leveling ground, building wooden platforms for tents and setting up tents.
Communications equipment then arrived six days late because pallets Tech.

Additional requests for radios, computer drops and phone lines for several other locations then added to the workload.
Once communications equipment arrived, however, they filled initial requests within 48 hours.
Anderson and Schmuhl mapped-out a detailed communications plan for the compound and used every bit of the equipment they brought with them.
Other communications personnel from the 74th now maintain the equipment on a two-week rotational basis.
Two-thirds of the communications unit includes Air Guardsmen from California, Illinois, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania., South Carolina, Utah and Washington.
Firefighting: A Real-World Misson Continued from Pg. 1 Manager, while air operations are directed by an Ã¯Â¿Â½Air AttackÃ¯Â¿Â½ Manager, who is normally a civilian.
This person gives coordinates for Ã¯Â¿Â½dip sitesÃ¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ where aircrews will fill their buckets Ã¯Â¿Â½ and Ã¯Â¿Â½drop sitesÃ¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ where the water will be dumped.
Ground crews can also direct aircraft to drop sites.
The helicopters shuttle back and forth between the dip and drop sites until directed to change locations, or until fuel runs low.
All refueling is done at the heli-base, where ground crews stand by to check the aircraft and do any needed maintenance.
Aircrews take a short break, and fill up on some much needed drinking water, which is essential in the hot, dry climate.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We normally go out early in the morning,Ã¯Â¿Â½ adds Bennett.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Then we take a break mid-day, and go out again from 3 in the afternoon till around 8 at night.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Since flight operations only take place during the day, all aerial fire containment must happen before nightfall.
Post-flight briefings are held at the end of every day, where crews can voice concerns or feedback about the dayÃ¯Â¿Â½s operations.
Aircrews then get a hot meal, a shower (if theyÃ¯Â¿Â½re lucky), and some much needed rest.
The following morning, an aviation briefing covers the previous daysÃ¯Â¿Â½ events, along with feedback on any issues brought up during the previous day.
Crews then report to their aircraft for another day of fighting fires.

However, all crews on rotation remain in a constant state of readiness throughout the entire fire season.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s a real-world mission,Ã¯Â¿Â½ says Bennett.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s something that leaves you with a feeling of accomplishment.
ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s very exciting, and it leads to some pretty good camaraderie among the crews.Ã¯Â¿Â½ But the toughest question to answer, according to Bennett? Ã¯Â¿Â½When will the fires end?Ã¯Â¿Â½ He says chuckling.
