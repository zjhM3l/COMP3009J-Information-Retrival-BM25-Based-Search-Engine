Council for Women and Domestic Violence Commission The House: A Woman's Place n a historic move, on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2002, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California was elected as the first woman ever to lead a major party in the U.S. Congress.
By secret vote, Pelosi, a 62-year-old Democrat from San Francisco, was elected by Democrats to the position of House minority leader.
As she said, she has waited 200 years for this.
From a political family in Baltimore, the mother of five had overwhelming support from her party.
Her election is a significant gain for women in the political arena.

Condolences The North Carolina Council for Women/Domestic Violence Commission would like to acknowledge the loss of a number of strong advocates for women's issues.
U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and his wife, Sheila, were strong advocates for women.
Recognized as humanitarians, the Wellstones advocated for justice and human rights, affordable and accessible health care and mental health parity.
Among their efforts was his co-sponsorship of the Family Violence Option, which created important protections for victims of domestic violence under 1996 welfare reform.
Wellstone had strong North Carolina connections, having received his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
U.S. Rep. Patsy Mink of Hawaii died in late September of this year.
She served as the first AsianAmerican woman elected to Congress.
A champion of women's rights, civil rights, education and poverty, she was perhaps best known for her co-authorship of Title IX, prohibiting discrimination against women and girls in federally funded education programs, including athletics.

Making Work Pay The welfare system has been reformed often over the past three decades with the objective of moving recipients off public assistance and into the labor force.
Until recently, the reforms did little to change a reality that keeps low-income families from becoming self-sufficient.
Many welfare recipients who find jobs remain poor because they either work only part time or at low wages or both.
In order to address this problem, pilot welfare initiatives were created in the 1990s adopting the "make work pay" approach, in which public funds are used to boost the income of welfare recipients who work.
This was the strategy of the Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP), a large-scale demonstration program operated in Canada and targeted at single parents receiving cash assistance.
SSP offered monthly earnings supplements to long-term recipients who left welfare for full-time work.
This project and its results are detailed in a study recently released by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC).
The study, Making Work Pay: Final Report on the Self-Sufficiency Project for Long-Term Welfare Recipients is available through MDRC at www.mdrc.org.

Women's Draft Agenda 2002-2003 N.C.
Women United, a consensus-based coalition of organizations committed to achieving full equality for, and empowerment of, women and individuals, has presented the 2002-2003 Women's Agenda Assembly Project.
Its purpose is to increase the collective voice of women in North Carolina by creating an opportunity for them to come together to discuss recommendations for changing public policies to better meet their needs and the needs of their communities.
These assemblies take place every other year in the fall preceding a new N.C. legislative session.
The agenda assemblies are held across the state and culminate in Advocacy Day, which is held at the opening of the long session of the N.C.
General Assembly.
This year, Advocacy Day is scheduled for March 4, 2003.
The following list contains issues under discussion at Agenda Assemblies being held across the state.
Issues for Consideration for the Women's Agenda 2003-2004 Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Access to Health Care Adolescent Pregnancy Aging Child Care Civil Rights Clean Elections Domestic Violence Economic Self-Sufficiency Educational Opportunity Housing Mental Health Pay Equity and Living Wage Sexual Assault

"Dignity Regardless of Age or Income" The Buncombe County Advisory Committee is separated into a Nursing Home Advisory Committee and an Adult Care Home (ACH) Advisory Committee due to the fact that Buncombe County has the largest number of ACHs in the state (100+).
This committee has been working on prioritizing action initiatives to ensure the rights and safety of residents in these homes.
The proposed initiatives have been generated after many months of dialogue as a committee, with DSS, and with the regional ombudsman.
The issues raised here are based on observation by committee members as well as feedback from ACH owners, supervisors in charge, and ACH residents.
The Live Oak Project defines an elder in the following way: An elder is a person who is still growing, still a learner, still with potential and whose life continues to have within it promise for, and connection to the future.
An elder is still in pursuit of happiness, joy, and pleasure and her or his birthright to these remain intact.
Moreover, an elder is a person who deserves respect and honor and whose work it is to synthesize wisdom from long life experience and formulate this into a legacy for future generations.
Adult care homes are residential care facilities providing personal care and supervision.
These homes serve a tremendously varied population in terms of the individual needs represented.
Young adults as well as elderly persons, having quite varied preferences and tastes, and persons with wide variations in their capability for independent living are all served in ACH.
In North Carolina, there are three types of licensed adult care homes: Family care homes (FCH) provide care for two to six unrelated adults who are in need of care; homes for the aged and disabled provide care for seven or more unrelated adults who are in need of care (ACH),;and group homes for developmentally disabled adults provide care for two to nine unrelated adults.
These three types of homes fall under different regulatory statutes depending upon their size and population.
The Social Services Commission, Division of Facility Services and county departments of social services have responsibility for licensure and regulation of these homes.
Every N.C. county also has community advisory committees that work closely with their regional ombudsman to ensure that the residents of these homes receive quality care.
Following is a summary of the Buncombe County Advisory Committee's draft work in this area.
Please remember that this is a work in progress; the wording may change, but the intent will remain.
Action Priorities 1.
Mandatory criminal background checks must be conducted on anyone having recurring resident contact in a family care home or an adult care home.
This includes outside relief staff, regular staff and domestic partners living in the home.
Anyone with a conviction for abuse, neglect, violent crime or child abuse may not be hired or live in the home.

"Dignity Regardless of Age or Income"
Continued from previous page
Reasons to consider this: The current regulation states that an ACH must perform a criminal background check on staff.
There is an assumption that the home would not hire anyone with a criminal history, but this is not always the case.
There is no language that prohibits the hiring of an individual after determining they have a criminal record.
There also is no provision to do background checks on other non-staff residents.
Often a husband/wife, boy/girlfriend will live in the home and there are many documented cases of abuse/violence in front of or including the residents.
The state should establish categories of convictions that would make someone ineligible to work in an ACH (i.e., drug abuse, violent crimes).
The Health Care Registry check is already in place and could be utilized by ACHs/FCHs.
2.
Minimum qualifications and training standards for SICs (supervisor in charge) should be increased from current level.
A minimum increase would include full first aid training (in addition to CPR) and personal safety training to be completed within the first or second week of hire.
SICs in FCHs need to be 21 and either a CNA or have already passed the 25 hour competency.
Reasons to consider this: At present the only application requirement for an SIC position is a high school diploma, a GED, or to pass a test.
There is no language which states that the diploma must be shown.
There are cases where employees have said they have a diploma but it was never verified.
First aid and safety training are barely mentioned in the current regs. 3.
The minimum level of personal spending money residents receive ($56 a month at present) from their monthly support checks should be increased immediately and thereafter be tied to the cost of living.
Reasons to consider this: Residents now are required to pay a $1 to $3 co-pay for prescriptions (many have more than one to fill each month), co-payments on doctor visits (at least once a month for most residents usually $10), all personal care items (toothpaste, hair care, etc.), clothes, and any other items (such as cigarettes) out of the $56 a month.
4.
Staff that cannot communicate using the English language should not work alone in providing ACH resident care.
They would need to partner with an English-speaking staff member while caring for residents.
Reasons to consider this: Many homes are hiring staff who speak little to no English.

WORK! To End Domestic Violence Day On Oct. 2, the Domestic Violence Commission's Workplace Policy and Public Awareness Committee hosted WORK! to End Domestic Violence Day at the Velvet Cloak Inn in Raleigh.
The event, supported by a grant from Philip Morris USA, was designed to invite private employers to show their support for developing policies and practices for addressing domestic violence in the workplace, and served as the kick-off event for the committee's efforts to highlight employers as a critical part of responding to domestic violence.
The committee is co-chaired by Johnny Lee, workplace violence prevention specialist with the N.C.
Office of State Personnel, and by Will Polk, section chief for Victim and Citizen Services at the Attorney General's Office.
The event, moderated by Will Polk, included remarks from a variety of speakers.
Among the most riveting and courageous was Coleen M., a member of the Workplace Committee whose personal story was featured in a nationally released video on domestic violence in the workplace.
Coleen described how she suffered from chronic harassment and threats from her ex-boyfriend and how this affected her employer, Software Completions.
She described the steps her employer took to not only protect her personal safety but also to assure her continued employment, a critical step to a victim's ability to extricate herself from an abusive relationship.
Stan Dilley, CEO for Software Completions, told the crowd that he never gave the incredible efforts he put into place to protect his employee a second thought.
"She was under attack," he said, and how could he justify assuring his customers the best of care without making McKinley Wooten (above photo, right) presents Leslie Starsoneck and Will Polk with Governor Easley's the same commitment to his employees? proclamation commemorating October as Domestic Lisa Angel, an attorney who represented Violence Awareness Month and Work to End Domestic Coleen and a member of the Domestic Violence Day.

commendable.
Dr. David Compton, director of occupational services for Philip Morris USA, challenged employers in attendance to take the steps necessary to respond to domestic violence not only because it's the right thing to do but because it clearly will improve their bottom lines.

2002 Legislative Session: Final Decisions and Their Impact This past legislative session was one filled with anxiety, cautious optimism, jarring reality, and finally resolution.
Although other important items were debated during this session including redistricting, the session revolved, for many people, around the significant cuts that were made to state spending in order to respond to the budget crisis.
The cuts resulted in the elimination of entire programs and lay offs of hundreds of state employees.
When the session concluded, there were still millions to be identified in order to balance the budget.
Advocates across the state are intensely concerned for the well-being of our most vulnerable citizens and the cuts are far from over as we enter a new fiscal year.
This summary is by no means a celebration of these cuts -- North Carolina families will feel the impact of reductions to programs for years to come.
Having said that, the programs over which this agency is responsible fared well in comparison to some other agencies and departments.
In addition, a number of important pieces of legislation, unrelated to budget matters, passed at a time when much legislation was lost amid budget discussions.
Budget Decisions There were no cuts in state-appropriated dollars to the three programs the agency administers.
The Governor, the Secretary of the Department of Administration, and members of the General Assembly did not recommend any cuts to the displaced homemaker, sexual assault or domestic violence grant programs.
One has only to browse the cuts made to many state departments to appreciate the significance of maintaining the level of grant funding.
As a result of the budget situation, the agency saw three staff positions eliminated including the abuser treatment program coordinator (a vacant position), the Displaced Homemaker Program coordinator, and the director of community education.
In addition, there was a reduction in the amount of agency operating funds.
Other Legislation The Domestic Violence Commission saw three bills on its legislative agenda enacted into law.
First, the General Assembly passed legislation that assured that North Carolina is in compliance with the federal Violence Against Women Act by a) prohibiting the charging of plaintiffs for costs associated with a domestic violence protective order and b) prohibiting the charging of victims of sexual assault for costs associated with forensic medical exams.
Second, the General Assembly passed legislation that created an Address Confidentiality Program in the Attorney General's Office for victims of sexual assault, stalking and domestic violence.
And third, the General Assembly passed legislation that grants rule-making authority to the Domestic Violence Commission to adopt rules to govern abuser treatment programs.
[A more thorough description of these bills can be found on the agency's Web site at www.doa.state.nc.us/cfw/cfw].

New Poverty Statistics Show that Poverty is Still a Women's Issue The recently released 2001 poverty statistics confirm that poverty is still an important women's issue: Many women still are poor, and women still are much more likely to be poor than men.
Poverty is measured by comparing annual income with the poverty standard which the federal government created in the 1960s and updates annually for inflation.
In 2001, the poverty standard was $9,039 for an individual, $11,569 for a family of two, $14,128 for a family of three, and $18,104 for a family of four.
Overall Poverty.
Some 60 percent of adults (i.e., age 18 or above) who were poor in 2001 were women.
Women were over 40 percent more likely to be poor than men, with a poverty rate of 11.8 percent compared to 8.3 percent for men.
Almost one of every eight women was poor, compared to about one of every 12 men.
Work Experience.
Work outside the home reduced the likelihood of being poor for both men and women.
However, women who worked outside the home in 2001 were almost 40 percent more likely to be poor than men who worked outside the home.
Education.
Education reduces the likelihood of being poor for both men and women.
However, women are much more likely to be poor than men with the same level of education, with a notable exception.
In 2001, women (age 25 or more) without a high school diploma were almost 50 percent more likely to be poor than men without a high school diploma.
Similarly, women with a high school diploma were 40 percent more likely to be poor than men with a high school diploma.
By contrast, the poverty rate for women with a bachelor's degree (or more) was only slightly higher than the rate for men with a bachelor's degree (or more).
Single Household Heads.
Families headed by a single women were twice as likely to be poor as families headed by a single man.
Child Care Costs.
In 1997, the most recent year for which this Census Bureau data is available, child care expenditures for those with child care costs averaged $288 a month, 32 percent of the monthly poverty line in that year for a family of two, and 27 percent of the monthly poverty line in that year for a family of three.
Hardship.
Poverty is strongly associated with real hardship.
A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) found that in a given year about 30 percent of the poor experienced critical hardship, defined as being evicted, having utilities disconnected, doubling up in others' housing due to lack of funds, or not having enough food to eat.
International Comparisons.
Many studies have concluded that poverty rates in the United States tend to be much higher than in other rich countries.
One recent study concluded that the United States had the highest poverty rate for female-headed households among the 22 countries studied, 30.9 percent compared to the 10.5 percent average for the group.
