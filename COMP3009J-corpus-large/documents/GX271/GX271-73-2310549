REVIEW OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS Pursuant to S.B. 1391, 76th Texas Legislature
INTRODUCTION
Legislative Charge to the Texas Workforce Commission During the 1999 session, the Texas Legislature enacted S.B. 1391 directing the Texas Workforce Commission to conduct a review of the child care allocation formulas in 40 T.A.C.
Section 800.58 to compare the Commission's current child care funding methodology with one that emphasizes providing funding to areas with the greatest need for child care services.
1 Background Information on Child Care Funding Funding for child care services in Texas is provided through a collection of federal and state sources.
These funding sources are designed to provide services to low-income families who are working or attending school or training.
The Texas Labor Code, Section 302, provides the basis and guidance for the Commission's allocation of major block grant programs to local workforce development areas (workforce areas).
In the case of funds that are allocated to the state through the application of established federal formulas, statute directs the Commission to allocate amounts across the state using the formula factors outlined in federal statute or regulations.2 Statute provides that, in the case of funds that are not allotted by formula to the state, the Commission shall develop a need-based formula that will equitably allocate funds among all workforce areas.3 With respect to job training, employment services, and child care to eligible persons, the Commission may establish need-based formulas to allocate to workforce areas the funds available under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA)4 in order to ensure compliance with federal participation rates and requirements for full utilization of the funding.
At least 80 percent of the funds available for workforce training and services must be allocated to workforce areas.5 Funds allocated include those for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Choices, Food Stamps Employment 
Employment Services moneys represent the only federal funding source allocated to workforce areas without utilizing income- or poverty-based need indicators, as these federal funds provide services to individuals regardless of income.6 The complete text of S.B. 1391 is found in Appendix A. Â§ 302.062(b), Texas Labor Code.
3 Â§ 302.062(c), Texas Labor Code.
4 P.L. 104-193.
5 Â§ 302.061, Texas Labor Code.
6 Federal Employment Services funds are authorized under the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 USC Chapter 4B).
Texas Labor Code Â§ 302.062(b) directs the Commission to provide Employment Services funds to 1 2
REVIEW OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS
For child care, the Commission complies with federal and state laws and regulations while assisting the greatest number of low income families who are working or transitioning into the workforce through participation in education or training activities, by providing affordable, accessible, and quality child care services.
The Commission's current child care allocation rules became effective beginning with FY 2000 allocations.7 These rules reflect the need indicators established in the federal Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) block grant to the state and include: 1.
a workforce area's relative proportion of the statewide total number of people whose income does not exceed 100% of the poverty level (mandatory funds) 2.
a workforce area's relative proportion of the statewide total number of children under the age of 13 years in families whose income does not exceed 150% of the poverty level (discretionary funds) 3.
a workforce area's relative proportion of the statewide total number of children under the age of 5 (mandatory funds) 4.
a workforce area's relative proportion of the statewide total number of children under the age of 13 years (matching funds) Similarly, FSE
Of that amount, $142.8 million10 is financed from state General Revenue and $621 million11, or 81% of the total, from CCDF.
A portion of the CCDF funds is contingent on the availability of state and/or local funds.
Through FY 2000, the Agency and the Boards have obtained all federal matching funds set aside for Texas.
Approximately 97 percent of appropriated child care funds are allocated by the Commission to workforce areas for management and expenditure by Texas' 28 local workforce development boards (Boards).12
workforce areas under a block grant process for administration of these services by the Boards.
The U.S. Department of Labor, however, has prohibited Texas from implementing state law, requiring that Employment Services be delivered by state employees [20 CFR Part 651-658].
7 40 T.A.C. 40 Â§800.58 - see Appendix B for compete text of allocation rules.
8 7 CFR Part 273, which directs that parents of children under age 6 are exempt from federal FSE
9 Excludes $25.6 million appropriated for Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services (PRS) child care, which is not allocated to workforce areas by the Commission.
10 Required state maintenance of effort (MOE) and match.
11 Includes $79.1 million of TANF converted to CCDF and $2 million in TANF converted to Title XX. 12 See Appendix C for a map of Boards and the workforce areas they serve.

REVIEW OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS
ANALYSIS OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATIONS Data on Need Criteria Outlined in S.B. 1391 We began our analysis by looking at data items for specific need identification criteria outlined in S.B.1391.
These need indicator data items include: ! ! ! ! ! !
Number of children under age 13 living at or below 100% of poverty level Number of children in Head Start program Number of children in the school lunch program Number of children in families "eligible" for TANF Number of children in families "eligible" for Food Stamps Number of children in families "eligible" for Medicaid
17
Using county level data aggregated by workforce area, we charted each need indicator data item by area, showing the bimodal distribution of workforce area data around the statewide mean.
A bimodal distribution shows the difference between the value of the data item for each workforce area in relation to the statewide mean.
Some area values are above the mean and other area values are below the mean.
Data points can also be described in terms of their relation to a "standard deviation" from the mean.
The standard deviation is calculated by averaging the difference between all data points and the mean.
With the data displayed in this fashion, several details are apparent.
First, the Gulf Coast workforce area is consistently a positive "outlier" case, meaning that the values of the data for this area are consistently more than two standard deviations above the statewide mean.
Because the Gulf Coast workforce area has the largest population, this result is expected.
Second, other large population workforce areas also tend to show data point values above, rather than below, the statewide mean.
17
S.B. 1391 requested using the criterion children under age 14 living below 100% of poverty level.
However, federal law restricts the use of CCDF to child care services for children under age 13 (unless the child is disabled), and data are available only for children under age 13 [29 CFR Part 0-99].

REVIEW OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS
Comparison of Need Indicator Data Items with Actual Allocations Next, we compared the aforementioned data to the Commission's actual allocations of child care funding for FY 2001.
Additionally, we added for comparison two data items that are not need criteria as outlined in S.B. 1391: total population meeting federal poverty guidelines19 and number of children under 5 years of age in the total population.20 These need indicator items are consistent with those used in the federal CCDF methodology for allotting funds to the state.
The first data item provides the broad background parameter of the population from which those families needing child care are drawn.
The second data item is a good indicator of possible need for child care services.
Children under 5 years of age consume the largest portion of child care services.
These young children need full-time care all year.
Charts 7a and 7b illustrate the close correspondence between all need indicator data items and FY 2001 child care allocations to workforce areas.
This correspondence is particularly close for those workforce areas whose data values are at least one standard deviation from the mean.
These workforce areas tend to be consistently above or below the statewide average on all data items.
Workforce areas consistently above the statewide average on all data items include, in order from highest to lowest, Gulf Coast, Dallas, Alamo, Tarrant County, Upper Rio Grande, and Lower Rio Grande.
Workforce areas consistently below the statewide average on all data items include, in order from lowest to highest, Texoma, Concho Valley, Golden Crescent, North Texas, Brazos Valley, North East, Heart of Texas, West Central, Deep East Texas, Middle Rio Grande, South East Texas, Panhandle, Rural Capital, South Plains, Permian Basin, and South Texas.
Those workforce areas having values closest to the statewide mean are less consistent.
Values for these workforce areas may be slightly above the statewide mean on some data items and below the statewide mean on other data items.
These workforce areas include Cameron County, East Texas, Capital Area, Coastal Bend, and North Central.
Note that the Commission's allocations (green area) have fewer sharp ups and downs across workforce areas in the mid-section of the chart, showing that the Commission's allocation methodology tends to "average out" the slightly higher and slightly lower variations around the statewide mean on these differing data items.

REVIEW OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS
Visual comparison of the data shows the close correspondence between the need indicators identified by S.B. 1391 and the Commission's child care allocations for FY 2001.
To analyze that correspondence more precisely, we constructed a correlation matrix of all data items.
The matrix gives correlation coefficients for data items compared in sets of two.
Correlation coefficients measure the relationship between two data sets.
The calculation is the covariance of the two data sets divided by the product of their standard deviations.
Correlation analysis helps to determine whether two sets of data "move" together-that is, whether large values of one set are associated with large values of the other (positive correlation), whether small values of one set are associated with large values of the other (negative correlation), or whether values in both sets are unrelated (correlation near zero).
A correlation coefficient equal to one indicates a perfect correlation.
The closer a correlation coefficient value is to one, the more closely the two sets of data are correlated-that is, the more closely the data "move" together.
Chart 8 shows the correlation matrix for all data items, each item compared to all other items one at a time.
Note that the correlation coefficient values are all positive and all are above .90, indicating very strong correlations between all data items.

REVIEW OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS
Correlation of S.B. 1391 Need Indicator Data Items with Need Indicators in the Commission's Current Rule The Commission currently utilizes poverty-based need indicator data in its child care allocation methodology.
Next, the correspondence between the need indicator data items outlined in S.B. 1391 and those outlined in current child care allocation rules was more closely examined.
Correlation analysis again reveals that the coefficient values are all positive and most are highly correlated.
This indicates that both sets of need indicator data items are measuring the same "construct"-that is, all of the need indicator data items are measurements of poverty.
This correlation matrix is shown in Chart 9.
The correlation coefficient values in Chart 9 that are below .90 are those that would be expected to be lower due to differing populations reflected in the data.
In other words, the population in one set is a small subset of or only marginally intersects with the population in the other data set.
For example, coefficients for children age 6-12 of Food Stamp Employment and Training (FSE
The lowest value coefficient is the correlation between that data item and children in poverty under age 5.
This result obtains because work registration is not mandatory for parents with children under age 6.
Thus, the only families represented in both populations would be those FSE
Because those families do have a child under age 6, the parent or parents would not be subject to mandatory work registration.
Please note, however, that the Commission only uses this need indicator in its methodology for allocating federal FSE
Thus, this data item is a good indicator for that particular funding source since it is consistent with federal regulations regarding the usage of those dollars.

REVIEW OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS
Additional Need Indicator Information and Analysis Survey of Other States The Agency surveyed seven states (Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin) about their methods for allocating child care funds.23 One state, Ohio, did not answer how the funds were allocated other than to indicate that counties are reimbursed for the cost of their child-care programs.
Ohio counties decide eligibility and authorize care for a 12-month period.
Of the other 6 states, 5 use some poverty measure as an indicator of need in their allocation process, including the number of TANF recipients, number of families living in poverty, and number of children under age 6 living in poverty.
Three states use historical funding numbers in their allocation.
Two states use the total number of working women with children under 6 years old in their calculations, and two use market studies to vary funding by cost of child care in different regions.
Consultation with Boards The Commission has frequently conferred with Boards and others in establishing child care funding practices, including determining allocation methods.
All child care allocation rules were published in the Texas Register and subject to public comment.24 Of the comments received, none were critical of the need indicators set out in the proposed rules.
Moreover, the Commission has held public hearings in diverse locations across the state on the allocation formulas, pursuant to the federal planning requirements.
These hearings were attended by Board representatives, child care contractors, care providers, parents, and other child care stakeholders such as Head Start, public and private schools and preschools, and early childhood education experts.
The Agency has also conducted periodic workshops for Board members and staff on federal and state appropriations, allocation rules, and formulas, gathering comments through these forums.
Additionally, weekly conference calls are held during which Agency staff confer with Board representatives on child care funding and funds management and a variety of other topics concerning provision of local workforce services, including child care services.
Board representatives frequently commented on their particular workforce area's needs and the Commission's allocation methods during the period in which proposed rules were under review.
The Commission's current child care formulas and allocation rules reflect these consultations with Boards.
CONCLUSIONS In compliance with S.B. 1391, this review of the Commission's child care allocation formulas and methods outlined in 40 T.A.C. Â§ 800.58 compared data items for specific need identification criteria outlined in S.B.1391 with FY 2001 allocations to Boards.
These need indicator data items include:

Number of children under age 13 living at or below 100% of poverty level Number of children in Head Start program Number of children in the school lunch program Number of children in families "eligible" for TANF Number of children in families "eligible" for Food Stamps Number of children in families "eligible" for Medicaid
Workforce areas consistently above the statewide average on all data items include, in order from highest to lowest, Gulf Coast, Dallas, Alamo, Tarrant County, Upper Rio Grande, and Lower Rio Grande.
Workforce areas consistently below the statewide average on all need indicator data items include, in order from lowest to highest, Texoma, Concho Valley, Golden Crescent, North Texas, Brazos Valley, North East, Heart of Texas, West Central, Deep East Texas, Middle Rio Grande, South East Texas, Panhandle, Rural Capital, South Plains, Permian Basin, and South Texas.
Those workforce areas that have values closest to the statewide mean are less consistent.
Values for these workforce areas may be slightly above the statewide mean on some data items and below the statewide mean on other data items.
These workforce areas include Cameron County, East Texas, Capital Area, Coastal Bend, and North Central.
The Commission uses need indicators in the current allocation method developed in consultation with Boards.
The need indicators used are similar to those used to allocate federal child care funds to the state.
We find that the need indicator items currently used in determining allocations are consistent with the need indicator data items outlined in S.B. 1391.
In fact, correlation coefficients indicate that both sets of need indicator data items are measuring the same "construct"-that is, all data items are measuring poverty.
Comparison of the allocation methodology used in Texas with that of other states shows that the Commission's method is consistent with at least 5 other, similar states.
After thorough analyses of the data, the Commission concludes that the current child care funds allocation method is consistent with need in the state.
Therefore, the Commission recommends continued use of the current allocation methodology.
In most cases, the indicators used by the Commission are specific to a federal funding source and are the preferred indicators to use in allocating funds to serve the specific populations mandated under federal statutes or regulations.

APPENDIX A Text of S.B. 1391
AN ACT [S.B. 1391] 1-1 relating to the review by the Texas Workforce Commission of the 1-2 allocation of certain funds for child care.
1-3 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS: 1-4 SECTION 1.
REVIEW OF CHILD CARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS.
1-5 (a) The Texas Workforce Commission, in consultation with local 1-6 workforce development boards, shall conduct a review of the child 1-7 care allocation formulas in 40 T.A.C.
Section 800.58 to compare the 1-8 commission's current child care funding system with a system that 1-9 emphasizes providing funding to areas with the greatest need for 1-10 child care services.
1-11 (b) In conducting the review required by this Act, an area's 1-12 need for child care services shall be evaluated according to the 1-13 number of children in the area who: 1-14 (1) are under the age of 14 and who live in poverty, 1-15 as defined by federal law; 1-16 (2) participate in poverty-based programs, including 1-17 Head Start and school lunch programs; and 1-18 (3) are members of families eligible for Temporary 1-19 Assistance to Needy Families, food stamps, or Medicaid.
1-20 (c) After consideration of the criteria established under 1-21 Subsection (b) of this section and other relevant factors, the 1-22 Texas Workforce Commission shall determine: 1-23 (1) which local workforce development areas have the 1-24 greatest need for child care services; and 2-1 (2) how child care resources are currently distributed 2-2 to those areas.
2-3 (d) In conducting the review under this section, the Texas 2-4 Workforce Commission shall propose alternative methods of 2-5 allocating child care funds that address any allocation inequities 2-6 identified by the review.
The commission shall identify other 2-7 programs and formulas under the commission's jurisdiction that 2-8 allocate money to local workforce development areas and that do not 2-9 take poverty-based measures into consideration.
2-10 (e) The Texas Workforce Commission shall report the findings 2-11 and recommendations required by this Act not later than November 1, 2-12 2000, to the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the house of 2-13 representatives, and to both houses of the legislature.
The 2-14 recommendations shall include proposals for any necessary 2-15 legislation to address child care allocation formulas, taking into 2-16 consideration which local workforce development areas have the 2-17 greatest need for child care services.
2-18 SECTION 2.
EMERGENCY.
The importance of this legislation 2-19 and the crowded condition of the calendars in both houses create an 2-20 emergency and an imperative public necessity that the 2-21 constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several 2-22 days in each house be suspended, and this rule is hereby suspended, 2-23 and that this Act take effect and be in force from and after its 2-24 passage, and it is so enacted.
APPENDIX B TWC Child Care Allocation Rules
40 T.A.C. Â§800.58.
Child Care Allocations (a) Funds available to the Commission for child care services will be allocated to the workforce areas using need-based formulas, as set forth in this section.

APPENDIX D Texas Health and Human Services Commission Methodological Notes 
PROJECTION OF SEVERAL COUNTY-LEVEL POPULATIONS OF INTEREST TO TWC Methodological Notes Prepared By: Research Department Texas Health and Human Services Commission February 9, 2000 Following is an account of the methodological steps taken to develop county-level projections of several populations of interest to the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC).
I. Projections of the Number of Children Ages 0 - 12 At/Below 100% of Poverty in the Year 2000 These projections were done following a 4-step method.
1.
A first set of projections was developed by extrapolating county-level poverty rates taken from the 1990 U.S. Census covering the population of children ages 0 - 11 (the closest age cohort for which this kind of information was available from the 1990 U.S. Census).
These rates were applied to year 2000 projections of the population ages 0 - 12 in Texas, by county.
The population projections for the year 2000 were obtained from the Texas State Data Center (SDC) at Texas A
2.
A second set of projections was developed by applying the projected county-level poverty rates for 1999 for children under the age of 18 to year 2000 county-level projections of the population ages 0 12 in Texas.
The population projections were obtained from the SDC.
The 1999 poverty rates were obtained from the poverty projections model developed by staff from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission in the Spring of 1999.
3.
A third set of projections, or set of preliminary final projections, was developed by averaging, on a county basis, the data on projected number of children at/below 100% of poverty developed in steps 1 and 2.
4.
Last, the county-level final preliminary projections developed in step 3 were then ratio-adjusted so that their sum, across all counties, would match a separately developed statewide projection of the number of children ages 0 - 12 at/below 100% of poverty in the year 2000.
The statewide projection was developed by applying, or extrapolating, statewide poverty rate data for Texas children ages 0 12, obtained from the March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS) for Texas, to a statewide projection of the total number of children ages 0 - 12 in the year 2000 obtained from the SDC.
II.
Projections of the Number of Children Ages 0 - 12 At/Below 150% of Poverty in the Year 2000 (Population Potentially Eligible for State-Subsidized Child Care) These projections were done following a 2-step method.
1.
A first set of projections was developed by extrapolating county-level data on the percent of children ages 0 - 11 living at/below 150% of poverty taken from the 1990 U.S. Census.
The data for the age 0
-11 cohort was the closest to our cohort of interest (ages 0 - 12) for which this kind of information could be developed based on results from the 1990 U.S. Census.
These county-specific percents, or rates, were applied to county-level year 2000 projections of the population ages 0 - 12 in Texas.
The population projections statistics were obtained from the SDC. 2.
The county-level projections developed in step 1 were ratio-adjusted so that their sum, across all counties, would match a separately developed statewide projection of the number of children ages 0 12 at/below 150% of poverty in the year 2000.
The statewide projection was developed by applying, or extrapolating, data on the percentage of Texas children ages 0 - 12 living at/below 150% of poverty, obtained from the March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS), to a statewide projection of the total number of children ages 0 - 12 in the year 2000 obtained from the SDC. III.
Projections of the Number of Children Ages 0 - 12 At/Below 130% of Poverty in the Year 2000 (Population Potentially Eligible for Food Stamps) These projections were done following a 2-step method.
1.
A first set of projections was developed by extrapolating county-level data on the percent of children ages 0 - 11 living at/below 130% of poverty taken from the 1990 U.S. Census.
The age 0 -11 cohort was the closest to our cohort of interest (ages 0 - 12) for which this kind of information could be estimated based on results from the 1990 U.S. Census.
These county-specific percents, or rates, were applied to county-level year 2000 projections of the Texas population ages 0 - 12 obtained from the SDC. 2.
The county-level projections developed in step 1 were ratio-adjusted so that their sum, across all counties, would match a separately developed statewide projection of the number of children ages 0 12 at/below 130% of poverty in the year 2000.
The statewide projection was developed by applying, or extrapolating, data on the percentage of Texas children ages 0 - 12 living at/below 130% of poverty, obtained from the March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS), to a statewide projection of the total number of children ages 0 - 12 in the year 2000 obtained from the SDC. IV.
Projections of the Number of Children Ages 0 - 12 Potentially Eligible for TANF in Year 2000 These projections were done following a 4-step method.
1.
A first set of projections was developed by estimating the number of children ages 0-12 potentially eligible for TANF, by county, from statewide data reflecting the rate of participation in TANF among potentially eligible children ages 0 - 12.
Data taken from the March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS) for Texas was used to project the percent of Texas children ages 0 - 12 in the year 2000 potentially eligible for TANF.
Data taken from Texas Department of Human Services' files was used to establish the number of TANF enrollees ages 0 -12, by county, as of the most recent point in time available (December of 1999).
The first set of projections of potential eligibles was obtained by multiplying the estimated statewide rate of participation among TANF potentially eligible children ages 0-12 by the county-specific TANF enrollment level (for children ages 0-12) as of the most recent time period available (in this portion of the model, equal participation rates among TANF potential eligibles across all counties are assumed).
2.
A second set of projections was developed by applying statewide percents, which reflect the rate at which children ages 0 - 12, by race/ethnicity, appear to be potentially eligible for TANF, to countylevel projections of the number of Texas children ages 0 - 12, by race/ethnicity, for the year 2000.
The data reflecting the percent of children ages 0 - 12 potentially eligible for TANF was obtained
from the March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS) for Texas.
The county level projections of the number of Texas children ages 0 - 12, by race/ethnicity, were obtained from the SDC. 3.
A third set of projections, in this case a set of preliminary final projections, was developed by averaging, on a county basis, the 2 separate sets of projections of number of children ages 0-12 potentially eligible for TANF obtained in steps 1 and 2.
4.
Last, the county-level preliminary final projections developed in step 3 were ratio-adjusted so that their sum, across all counties, would match a separately developed statewide projection of the number of children ages 0 - 12 potentially eligible for TANF in the year 2000.
This separate statewide projection was developed by applying, or extrapolating, the statewide percent of Texas children potentially eligible for TANF, based on March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS) data, to projections of the population of children ages 0 - 12 for the year 2000 obtained from the SDC. V. Projections of the Number of Children Ages 0 - 12 Potentially Eligible for Medicaid in Year 2000 These projections were done following a 4-step method.
1.
A first set of projections was developed by estimating the number of children ages 0-12 potentially eligible for Medicaid, by county, from statewide data reflecting the rate of participation in Medicaid among potentially eligible children ages 0 - 12.
Data taken from the March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS) for Texas was used to project the percent of Texas children ages 0 - 12 in the year 2000 likely to be potentially eligible for Medicaid.
Data taken from Texas Department of Human Services' files was used to establish the number of Medicaid enrollees ages 0 -12, by county, as of the most recent point in time available (December of 1999).
This first set of projections of potential eligibles was then obtained by multiplying the estimated statewide rate of participation -among potentially eligible children ages 0-12 for Medicaid -- by the county-specific Medicaid actual enrollment level for children ages 0-12 as of the most recent time period available (in this portion of the model, equal participation rates among Medicaid potential eligibles across all counties are assumed).
2.
A second set of projections was developed by applying statewide percents reflecting the percent of children ages 0 - 12 who are projected to be potentially eligible for Medicaid in the year 2000, according to race/ethnicity, to county-level projections of the number of Texas children ages 0 - 12, according to race/ethnicity, for the year 2000.
The data reflecting the percent of children ages 0 - 12 potentially eligible for Medicaid were obtained from the March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS) for Texas.
The county level projections of the number of Texas children ages 0 - 12, by race/ethnicity, were obtained from the SDC. 3.
A third set of projections, or set of preliminary final projections, was developed by averaging, on a county basis, the 2 separate sets of projections of number of children ages 0-12 potentially eligible for Medicaid developed in steps 1 and 2.
4.
Finally, the county-level projections developed in step 3 were ratio-adjusted so that their sum, across all counties, would match a separately developed statewide projection of the number of children ages 0 - 12 potentially eligible for Medicaid in the year 2000.
This separate statewide projection was developed by applying, or extrapolating, the statewide percent of Texas children potentially eligible for Medicaid, based on March of 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS), to projections of the population of children ages 0 - 12 for the year 2000.
The population projections of children 0-12 for the year 2000 were obtained from the SDC.

RESPONSE FROM STATES Wisconsin Contact: Dave Edie Edieda@dwd.state.wi.us
Methodology: Wisconsin disburses child care subsidy funds at the central level.
When Wisconsin previously provided allocations to 72 counties, they used the following equal weighting factors: 1.
The number of AFDC recipients in each county, and 2.
The number of women in each county who work and have children under the age of 6.
Counties were held harmless at their most recent allocation level and used the formula only for new funds.
Montana Contact: Linda Fillinger Lfillinger@state.mt.us
Methodology: Formerly, Montana allocated subsidy and administrative funds to our Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR
Our CCR
Presently, we have a formula for allocating our administrative funds to our CCR
Minnesota Contact: Elizabeth Roe Elizabeth.Roe@state.mn.us
Methodology: Minnesota distributes funds to counties for our Basic Sliding Fee Child Care Assistance Program.
Families who are participating in MFIP (TANF program) or Transition Year are fully funded, and so funds are not truly allocated.
Minnesota shifted from an allocation based on demographic information to one based on demand information because our demographic information did not reflect self-identified need.
The 1999 legislature modified he formula used by the Department of Children, Families and Learning to allocate Basic Sliding Fee funds to counties.
The change removes the demographic elements used in the current allocation formula and instead allocates funds on the basis of unmet need and projected demand.
The funds are distributed based on the following formula:
Minnesota Statutes 119B.03, subd. 6 and 8
1.
2.
3.
4.
One-fourth of the funds shall be allocated in proportion to each county's total expenditures for the basic sliding fee child care program reported during the most recent fiscal year completed at the time of the notice of allocation.
One fourth of the funds shall be allocated based on the number of families participating in the transition year child care program as reported during the most recent quarter completed at the time of the notice of allocation.
One fourth of the funds shall be allocated in proportion to each county's most recently reported first, second and third priority groups on the waiting list as defined in M.S. 119B.03 subd.2.
One fourth of the funds must be allocated in proportion to each county's most recently reported waiting list as defined in M.S. 119B.03 subd. 2.
County reports and other sources used to determine greatest need for child care Services
This formula applies to the funds remaining after funds have been allocated in amounts equal to each county's guaranteed floor.
When funding increases are implemented within a calendar year, a county's guaranteed floor is equal to 100% of its original allocation for the same calendar year.
County reports reveal which areas have the greatest need for child care services: 1.

Methodology: County allocations are based on a formula that takes into account the following:
County Allocations
All counties were assured to receive an amount that equaled the total of: 1.
2.
Federal and State child care spending across all eligibility categories (TANF-related, low income, transitional, at-risk, etc) in the base year (1995) Cash value of dependent care income disregard
3.
Moneys in excess of this base are allocated by a formula that takes into account : - % of State's income eligible kids that live in that county; - relative cost of care in that county; and - number of additional kids that could require child care in that county in the coming year due to the difference in the required TANF work participation rates for the upcoming year versus the work participation rates that county achieved in the previous period.
Sources of data for determining areas having the greatest need for child care
We have been using this approach for the last 3 years.
The only difference is that in the 2nd and 3rd years Â­ the base accelerated ONLY to show increased spending on behalf of clients in TANF work activities.

Methodology: State of Ohio supervises the county administered child care system through a reimbursement process.
The state receives all child care funds (TANF, CCDF, Title XX, General Revenue) and combines all funding.
Each county houses a County Department of Human Services with county offices that administer the child care programs.
County offices perform eligibility process.
If the child is eligible for care, the county authorizes care for a 12-month period.
Eligibility
Â· Â· Â· Â·
Eligibility is based on family size and income.
If income is 
Parents pay copay to the provider; the balance of the cost of care is paid by the county to the provider.
No fee can exceed 10% of income.
Residency Providers
The county must be the family's "permanent" residency; eligible through residency as soon as they move into the county.
All providers are certified.
There are 2 levels of certification for providers.
1.
Limited certification (relative care), and 2.
Professional certification (licensed and group homes).

Ohio only had to freeze enrollment twice since 1990, because budget was exceeded.
At present, child care funds are being underutilized and the state is considering allowing the limits to be increased to

Methodology: For purposes of the distribution of child care services dollars, there are two varieties of funds to be allocated; categorical and non-categorical funds.
Categorical funds are dollars that have been designated for a specific purpose.
For instance in SFY 99-00, North Carolina set aside an amount of funds to help our state meet federal TANF maintenance of effort requirements.
These funds were distributed in a way to best serve the purpose of meeting this goal.
In this case, funds were allocated to counties with higher populations of families receiving TANF services.
Allocation of categorical funds is variant depending upon the funding source and specific goals set for the dollars to be allocated.
Allocation Formula Criteria The vast majority of funds that are allocated each year however are of the non-categorical variety.
These funds are distributed by a formula that is defined in state legislation.
Each county receives their share of funding based upon three criteria.
These criteria are: 1.
Total county population, 2.
County population of children under 6 living in poverty, and 3.
County population of working mothers with children under 6.
For each of these measures 1/3 of all available non-categorical funds are distributed on a prorated basis to each county.
In addition there is a provision in the funding formula to guarantee that each county receives a minimum amount of funding.
This minimum is currently set at the amount that each county spent for child care services in SFY 1995-96.
Each county may use up to 4% or $60,000 of their total allocation (whichever is greater) for administration and services support activities.
The data for total county population, county population of children under 6 living in poverty and county population of working mothers are census based.
The North Carolina Office of State Planning also provides projections for total county population and county population by age for non-census years that are used to update these figures.
The initial allocation of funds to counties are distributed by a set formula.
However, state legislation includes a provision for the reallocation of subsidized child care funds.
One way that the state determines the need for services is by monitoring county spending patterns throughout the SFY.
Whenever necessary, funds may be moved from counties that are not anticipated to use all of their funds to counties where additional funds may be required.
If necessary, the reallocation of funds is typically completed on a quarterly basis.
