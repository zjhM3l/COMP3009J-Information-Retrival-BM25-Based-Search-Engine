Special thanks to Bob Murzyn who has done an excellent job managing the frog database.
Much appreciation goes to Dave Christopherson for his help with data analysis.
ABSTRACT Since the discovery of malformed frogs at a rural farm pond in 1995, it appears that the problem of malformed frogs will not disappear any time soon.
The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has partnered with many nationally recognized researchers to investigate this problem.
With the help of citizen's interest and funding from the Governor's Initiative, the MPCA was able to pull these experts together as well as document and uncover the many types and frequencies of malformed frogs across Minnesota.
This report summarizes field data collected during the 1997, 1998 and 1999 field seasons.
The MPCA's frog surveys show malformation frequencies and types vary at each site throughout the field season and from year to year.
The larval survey data set is limited but shows differential growth rates between sites.
The NEY pond has evidence of developmental delay evidenced by larvae in the pond on 9/16/98 and recently metamorphosed frogs (evidenced by incomplete resorption of tail) as late as 10/13/98.
There was no evidence of additional reproduction, measured by no additional calling, no additional egg masses and lack of gravid females later in the season.
During this three-year period, MPCA field crews caught and examined 16,903 frogs, visiting over 167 different sites.
Seven of these sites (3 affected sites and 4 reference sites) were selected for ongoing studies each year.
During these years, two of the three affected study sites (CWB and ROI) had malformation rates in juvenile northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) as high as 20%.
At CWB, the mink frog (Rana septentrionalis) was more severely affected than the leopard frog with malformation rates as high as 75%.
Malformations occur almost exclusively in juvenile frogs.
Adults rarely exhibit malformations.
This indicates lowered fitness in malformed frogs resulting in low survivability through their first winter.
These affected frogs are either more susceptible to predation due to their abnormality, or their overall health is weakened, making them unfit to endure harsh winter conditions.

(1998).MPCA biologists continued the Granite Falls investigation during the spring and summer of 1994.
Frog surveys were conducted at several wetlands and soil and wetland sediment samples were collected for chemical analysis.
No abnormal frogs were found in 1994.
More detailed information on the Granite Falls frog investigation is found in Gernes (1997) and Helgen (1997).
In August of 1995, MDNR staff referred Cindy Reinitz, a teacher at the Minnesota New Country School, to the MPCA for help investigating malformed frogs at the NEY pond.
Her students found several malformed frogs while on a nature hike and became immediately concerned.
MPCA biologists responded immediately to survey, photograph, and document the abnormalities.
Biologists surveyed the NEY pond four times that fall and a few additional sites in the local area.
Media coverage of the findings began with a write-up from the Henderson Independent newspaper and extended to other areas of the state.
A student from Meeker County reported another site, where the MPCA conducted a follow-up survey in late September.
Only a few other reports came into the agency during 1995.
In 1996, the MPCA received 180 reports of abnormal frogs and 14 reports of normal frogs (i.e., no abnormal frogs found) around the state from students, citizens and field biologists.
Field surveys and limited chemical analyses were conducted at some of these sites.
Media coverage intensified by fall.
As the scope of the problem increased, the MPCA joined forces with other agencies and researchers.
Cooperative agreements were developed to explore the possible causes and effects displayed in the frogs (listed below).

In 1996, Judy Helgen and Mark Gernes from the MPCA joined forces with Jim Burkhart at NIEHS.
The MPCA collected field data on frogs at selected sites throughout Minnesota to determine the extent of the problem, while Burkhart analyzed environmental samples from these sites.
Burkhart focused his efforts on the bio-activity of the samples collected.
Carol Meteyer from the USGS NWHC was contracted through NIEHS to conduct histopathological examinations of abnormal frogs collected from study sites.
Another major researcher was Perry Jones from the USGS in Moundsview, Minnesota.
He, along with Joe Magner from the MPCA, determined hydrologic flowpaths at each study site.
They also conducted environmental sampling to determine if any contaminants (pesticides, herbicides, cations, anions, metals, etc.) were present at these sites, as well as coordinating efforts of other USGS specialists.
Contracts were formed with other experts from a variety of disciplines to study hypotheses involving parasites, ultra-violet radiation and genetic variation.
A great deal of research and cooperation has gone and continues to go into this investigation.
Many of these researchers meet regularly to combine efforts and plan upcoming research.
It is our hope that by conducting this interdisciplinary research we will begin to understand the broad picture of these malformations.
The MPCA collected all frog specimens for cooperating researchers.
Since the MPCA was also responsible for the overall coordination, specimens were used by more than one researcher when ever possible.
This sharing of samples reduced the number of specimens removed from the study sites.
3 1997, 1998 and 1999 Field Seasons This investigation is an expansion of the work conducted in 1996.
Three pair of research sites consisting of normal (reference) and abnormal (affected) sites were the primary focus of this investigation.
These sites were located in LeSueur, Sibley, Meeker and Crow Wing counties in Minnesota (see Figure 1).
Each county contained an affected site and a reference site (the reference site in Sibley County was paired with the LeSueur County affected site) which were surveyed intensively from early spring through fall all three years.
Affected sites were classified as having an unusually high frequency of abnormalities (i.e. 
Reference sites were classified as having abnormality frequencies less than one percent, the general consensus among herpetologists as a natural rate for frog abnormalities.
Hoppe (1999) examined the archived samples of leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) at the University of Minnesota's Bell Museum of Natural History, which were collected from 1958 to 1963.
This examination showed an historical background level of abnormalities of 0.2%, considerably less than the 1% expected rate the MPCA set for reference sites.
This paired site design proved challenging as the proposed reference sites had malformation frequencies greater than the 1% expected natural rate.
The affected sites in this study remained the same from 1997 to 1999; however, the reference sites varied between years due to small population size or elevated malformation rates.
At reference sites with elevated malformation frequencies, there were significantly fewer malformed frogs than at the affected sites so site comparisons were still worthwhile.
Reference sites near the three affected sites were surveyed intensively all three years.
However, the paired reference site to the LeSueur County affected site (NEY) was different in 1998.
Due to low numbers of frogs found at this site (BUR) in LeSueur County in 1998, the 1999 surveys were conducted at the 1997 reference site (BOE) once more.
The Meeker county reference site (LMS) had to be dropped in late spring of 1999 due to wetland drainage for fisheries management reasons.
Therefore, although reference sites were surveyed all three years, comparisons are problematic.
In addition to fieldwork conducted from 1997 to 1999, citizen reports of malformed frogs from around the state of Minnesota were compiled into a database.
In 1997, MPCA field staff documented the citizen reports.
In 1998 and 1999, reports were documented by Hamline University's Thousand Friends of Frogs program in cooperation with the MPCA.
General water-quality measures were also taken during all years, but at different frequencies.
During this three-year period, sediments and tissues from field sites were analyzed for metals and organic chemicals by the MPCA and cooperating USGS researchers.
These results will be presented in separate reports.
Numerous other sites were surveyed apart from the paired study sites.
In 1997, 112 sites were visited in addition to the six paired sites, followed by 19 extra sites in 1998 and 25 additional sites in 1999.
A total of 132 additional surveys were conducted in 1997, 29 extra surveys in 4 1998 and 53 additional surveys in 1999.
Data from these additional surveys conducted outside the 3 paired sites are summarized in Appendix C. Figure 1.

5 Site Descriptions Le Sueur County NEY- affected site (1997 - 1999) The NEY pond is a shallow excavated wetland created to improve wildlife habitat.
This particular piece of land was subsequently transferred to the county to become a natural area for educational purposes as part of the NEY Environmental Learning Center.
The pond is set in a depressional area on the landscape.
Historically, this area had wet soils unsuitable for crop production.
Pond construction began in 1992.
A dike was built on the south side of the wetland between the pond and the ravine to the south to help prevent the pond from "blowing out" on that side (see Figure 2).
The ravine to the south of the pond runs down to a creek, which, in turn, flows into a nearby river.
A standpipe on the northeast corner of the wetland allows some water to flow out to the north.
When the pond was excavated, dredge material was deposited in the center of the pond creating two islands.
The sediments remaining in the pond are very firm, consisting primarily of clay and runoff sediment.
There are two farm access roads down to the pond, one on the north side and one on the south side.
The wetland sits on an eighty-acre plot of land surrounded entirely by agricultural fields, separated from them by a large grass buffer strip.
The fields have been on a corn-soybean rotation.
There are four tile lines entering the wetland, draining the agricultural fields located up-gradient of the pond.
As part of the restoration project, the landowner put in native prairie plantings on the southwest area and on the east peninsula.
The shoreline of the pond is comprised primarily of reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and rice-cut grass (Leersia oryzoides).
The pond has a large growth of leafy pond weed (Potamogeton foliosus) with sporadic patches of coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum) throughout the pond except for two areas near the islands.
There is no emergent aquatic vegetation.
Duckweed (Lemna minor) covered a small bay on the south side of the pond.
The abundant aquatic vegetation provides an excellent food source for resting migratory birds in the spring and fall.
Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) are present.
The NEY pond is fairly large (9.8 acres) with a maximum depth of 4 feet and an average depth of 1.5 feet.
The deepest locations are found in the middle of the pond.
The South end has a shallow bay-like area where the majority of leopard frog eggs were found.
Toward the end of July water levels usually dropped leaving 6-10 feet of exposed sediment around the perimeter.
Most juvenile frogs were caught along the southwest, south and southeast shorelines.
Several juveniles were caught along the grass driveway on the south side of the pond.
Surveys were also conducted on the northwest and northeast shorelines to determine if malformation rates were consistent around the pond.

NEY Site Diagram Water and sediment sampling stations are labeled on the diagram.
N Station #4 1997 
Station #1 was located in the small bay on the south side of the wetland.
Station #2 was located along the south shore about 40 yards to the west of station #1.
Station #3 was located where a tile line runs in by the island on the southwest shoreline.
Station #4 was located on the northwest corner of the wetland directly out from a large tree.
In 1998 and 1999 one round of sampling took place at the stations described above.
However, the majority of samples taken in 1998 and 1999 took place in the small bay at the south end of the pond as shown in Figure 2.
BUR- reference site to NEY (1998) The BUR pond is located approximately two miles from the NEY pond on the same side of the Minnesota River.
This constructed pond is fairly small.
It has a maximum depth of 12 feet, with an average depth of about 4 feet (see Figure 3).
A culvert drains into the pond on the 7 southeast side from an agricultural field to the east.
There is an out-flow drain on the west side of the pond.
The northeast and east side of the pond has a steep gradient, which continues into the water.
Two feet from the shoreline the pond-bottom slope drops off rapidly.
No vegetation is apparent at that point.
The west, southwest and south shoreline slopes are more gradual and drop off gradually 3 feet from shore.
The sediments have a thin layer of organic material over dense gray glacial till.
Planted warm season tall grasses and a few small sandbar willows (Salix exigua) surround the pond.
The edges have submergent and emergent vegetation.
Fathead minnows and bullheads (Pimephales promelas and Ictalurus) are present in the pond.
Leopard frogs and American toads both used this site as a breeding location, and eggs were primarily deposited in the shallow south-southwest area.
Most of the frogs were captured along the south shoreline, however, a few were caught on the remainder of the shore.
Although many egg masses were found at this pond only a small number of juveniles were observed.
This was most likely due to fish predation.
Figure 3.
BUR Site Diagram Water and sediment sampling stations are labeled on the diagram.
N S tati on #3 S tati on #2 S tati on #4 St a t i o n #1 Water samples were taken at four locations around the entire pond in 1998.
Station #1 was located on the shallow southern shoreline where many of the leopard frog eggs were laid.
The second station was on the northwest shoreline across from station #3, which was on the steep northeast shore.
The final station was located near the inflow of the culvert on the east shoreline.
8 Sibley County BOE- reference site to NEY (1997 and 1999) The BOE site is approximately two miles from the NEY site, however, it is located on the opposite side of the Minnesota River.
This is an excavated wetland located near a Minnesota River Valley terrace just south of a school.
It was constructed during the late 1970s.
The wetland sits in a cow pasture upon which several cows roam during the summer months.
The cows have direct access to the wetland.
The sedge/grassy area to the south of the wetland (see Figure 4) has been trampled extensively by these cows.
Agricultural fields sit to the east and west of the wetland.
The east field is 5-1/2 acres while the field on the west is 13 acres.
These fields are on a corn/soybean/alfalfa rotation.
The pond is primarily controlled by ground water from the upper glacial till plains.
The sediments consist of loose silts and organic material over stratified glacio-fluvial silts and sands.
Water flows through this wetland from the south and exits along the north side of the pond via a culvert.
The maximum depth of the pond is about 4 feet.
The school and campus border the north end of the wetland.
A small creek-like flowage drains the pond on the north end.
Figure 4.
BOE Site Diagram Water sampling stations are labeled on the diagram.
N Station #4 Station #3 Station #2 Station #1 There are two islands in the middle of the wetland that support large trees.
The west and north edges of the wetland consist of short grass.
The east and south edges of the wetland are primarily longer sedges, grasses and forbs.
About five large oak trees grow on the NW side of the wetland.
The wetland contained leafy pond weed (Potamogeton sp.) in 1997 and 1999.
No other aquatic vegetation was identified.
Frogs were caught in the short grass and along the edge of the entire wetland.
During both years, only small populations of leopard frogs and American toads were observed.
While 9 conducting larval surveys, bullheads, fathead minnows and a sunfish were captured (Ictalurus sp., P. promelas and Lepomis sp.).
Sample stations for this site were located around the entire wetland.
Station #1 was located on the southeast corner of the wetland at the water inflow.
Station #2 was located on the southwest corner of the wetland by the cow entrance.
Station #3 was located on the northwest corner of the wetland.
Station #4 was located on the northeast corner of the wetland in front of a culvert.
Meeker County ROI- affected site (1997-1999) The ROI pond is a natural depression that fills in wet years.
It is a very small pond (about 0.4 acres) surrounded by temporary lake homes to the south, one permanent house to the west and one permanent home on the southeast (see Figure 5).
The surrounding land, to the north and east, is undeveloped and supports maple, ash and oak trees.
The pond sits on a down-gradient slope between two lakes, one to the north and one to the south.
Along this gradient other temporary ponds are nestled in the woods up-gradient of ROI.
During a dry fall these ponds dry up, if shallow water remains it will freeze solid during the winter making them inhospitable for fish.
The ROI pond is surrounded by a one to three-meter buffer strip of grasses and forbs.
The landowners on the southwest shoreline constructed a two-foot wall with a stack of creosote railroad ties adjacent to the wetland.
Maximum depth is 3-1/2 feet in the middle, but average pond depth is about two feet (in early summer).
This pond is completely covered with very thick duckweed (Lemna minor) capable of supporting the weight of the leopard frogs.
Due to this thick growth, there was essentially no other submergent or emergent aquatic vegetation.
The top two to five centimeters of water were extremely warm compared to the cool water below.
This temperature differential varies quite a bit throughout the summer since the water level fluctuates drastically.
It was common to see a six-inch change in the water level during a two-week period.
There is a high organic load due to the leaf litter from the large number of trees around the edges of the wetland and the high concentration of duckweed.
All of this organic material built a very tight organic sediment layer over a fine sand layer which lies over a coarse grained sand.
Refuse observed throughout the pond included glass bottles, beer cans and other miscellaneous containers.
Frogs caught for surveys were collected around the entire pond.
The small size of the pond allowed field workers to cover the entire area in a short period of time.
The frogs would rest on exposed logs and branches especially on warm sunny days.
On cloudy, cooler days, a partner system was used where one person would coax frogs from the shoreline vegetation into the pond where the second person was waiting to capture the escaping frogs.
10 Figure 5.
ROI Site Diagram Water and sediment sampling stations are labeled on the diagram.
N Station #3 Station #4 Station #2 Station #1 The sampling stations were located around the entire wetland.
Station #1 was located on the south side about 10 feet out from the creosote wall.
Station #2 was located at the little dock on the west side of the pond.
Station #3 was located at the large fallen tree on the north side.
Station #4 was located on the northeast side of the wetland.
LMS- reference site to ROI (1997-1999) LMS is approximately four miles from the ROI site.
The wetland is located on the south side of a lake (see Figure 6).
Maximum water depth was 4 feet in the middle with an average depth of 2.5 feet.
It is a large wetland periodically used by the MDNR as a northern pike (Esox lucius) rearing pond.
It has not been used for this purpose the past five years.
When fish are to be reared in the pond, it is first drained to kill off vegetation before the fish are introduced.
Wood lots are located on the south and west sides (oak, ash, maple, aspen).
Cabins are located to the north of the wetland, lined along the lake, while a county road borders the eastern edge of the wetland.
Agricultural fields lie further to the east.
The south shore has a fairly steep gradient 11 flowing towards the pond.
The main agricultural influence is the field up-gradient to the south.
About one-fourth of the field drains by a ditch into the southwest corner of the wetland.
This field was on a corn/soybean rotation.
There is an outflow (connected to the lake) on the northwest corner of the wetland used to control the water level in the pond.
The wetland was filled with giant bur-reed (Sparganium eurycarpum), reed-canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), cattail (Typha sp.) and several sedges (Carex sp.).
Coontail (Ceratophyllum sp.) was the predominant submergent vegetation mostly located along the north shoreline of the site.
The sediment consists of a thick organic layer formed from decayed grasses over lacustrine silts and sand.
Egg masses were found along the south shoreline, near a small growth of willows (Salix sp.).
Strangely enough, in 1998 egg masses were found in the middle of the wetland attached to vegetation.
The depth at this location was 4 feet; however, the eggs were suspended a few inches from the surface of the water and about three inches above the floating vegetation mats.
Water above the mats was noticeably warmer than the water below.
Figure 6.
LMS Site Diagram Water sampling stations are labeled on the diagram.
N Station #2 Station #3 Station #4 Station #1 12 The wetland was drained in the fall of 1998.
However, about one foot of water remained until it completely dried up during the summer of 1999.
Eggs were laid in the shallow water in 1999 and their development was monitored.
The leopard frog population in the wetland was dramatically lower in 1999 than in 1998 due to this drainage.
Most of the metamorphs were captured along the south shore where there is a small flat grassy point jutting out into the wetland.
Several were found on the southeast and north edges.
Water sampling stations were located on the eastern half of the wetland.
Station #1 was located in the southeast corner of the wetland.
Station #2 was located in the northeast corner of the wetland.
Station #3 was located along the edge of the north side, out from a telephone pole located halfway along the north side.
Station #4 was directly south of station #3, in the middle of the wetland.
Crow Wing County CWB- affected site (1997-1999) The CWB site is an approximately 25-acre permanent pond/lake located within an isolated, round depression.
There is a steep down-gradient slope along the entire perimeter of the pond.
The maximum depth is eight feet, with smooth sloped edges and an average depth of about 41/2 feet.
Deciduous and coniferous trees surround the site, although approximately 1/10 of the shoreline is pasture where dairy cattle have access to the water.
A small portion of the shoreline is cut lawn with a dock (see Figure 7).
There are a few agricultural fields up-gradient on the west and northwest sides of the lake.
Both fields have been planted in corn the past few years with a few prior plantings of alfalfa.
The pond has several large but narrow stands of cattails (Typha latifolia), primarily along the west shore.
There are large stands of several sedges (Carex), bullrushes (Scirpus) and grasses along the entire shoreline.
Scattered white water-lily (Nymphaea odorata) are abundant along the shoreline.
The sediments are very loose and composed of organic material over sand with the littoral areas comprised mostly of coarse sand and gravel.
Several sandy bottom patches are intermixed among the mostly loose organic bottom.
Fathead and stickleback minnows (Pimephales promelas and Culaea inconstans) were present, and residents said bluegills (Lepomis) were present in past years, but not seen in the last 3 years.
The MPCA did not survey frogs at this site in 1997.
Instead, the MPCA contracted with Dr. David Hoppe, a professor at the University of Minnesota, who had already been surveying frogs at this site.
Surveys in 1997 were conducted along the western shoreline.
During 1998 and 1999, MPCA staff conducted juvenile surveys along the north shore to check for consistency of malformations around the entire pond.
Similar results were found at all sampled locations at this site, indicating that abnormalities were not a localized phenomenon.
13 Figure 7.
CWB Site Diagram Water sampling stations are labeled on the diagram.
N Station #4 N- 1998 
Station #1 was the northern-most station, located right near the cow pasture along the fence-line.
Station #2 was located about 30 yards north of the dock.
Station #3 was located at the dock.
Station #4 was located approximately 30 yards south of the dock.
During 1998 and 1999 water samples were collected at the above stations as well as at stations on the north and southeast shorelines as shown in Figure7.
MHL- reference site to CWB (1997- 1999) MHL is located approximately 3 miles from CWB.
This lake covers about 35 acres with a maximum depth of 25 feet and average depth of 10 to 12 feet.
Mature forest surrounds this lake except along the north and east shoreline where there are a few cabins (see Figure 8).
The forest is primarily maple and birch with a few pines.
The north and northeast shoreline has a steep grade, whereas the south and southwest areas have a shallow gradient.
There are 3 large boggy areas in the northwest, southeast and southwest portions of the lake.
14 Figure 8.
MHL Site Diagram Water sampling stations are labeled on the diagram.
Station #4- 1997 NW Station #1- 1997 NW N Station #3- 1997 NW Station #2- 1997 NW Station #1- 1998 
The lakeshore along the boggy areas has several sedges (Carex), bullrushes (Scirpus), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacae), lily pads, and arrowhead (Saggitaria).
Submergent vegetation was abundant along the lakeshore.
Several sunfish, northern pike (Lepomis, Esox lucius) and minnows were observed along the lakeshore.
The lake was treated extensively by the MDNR in the past with herbicides (Aquatholl K and Granular 2,4-D) to control the aquatic vegetation (Radomski, 1995).
15 Metamorph surveys were conducted on the northwest side in 1997 and on the southeast shoreline of the lake in 1998 and 1999.
The change in survey locations was made in order to obtain survey data on northern leopard frogs observed only on the southeast shoreline.
Surveys in 1997 and 1999 contained information on only mink and green frogs, while surveys in 1998 contained information on mink, green and leopard frogs.
Although surveys were conducted on the southeast shoreline in 1999, no leopard frogs were captured.
One survey was conducted on the north side in 1999 to determine if the leopard frogs had moved, but none were found.
In 1997 several collections of water were taken from four sampling stations along the northwest shoreline.
Station #1 was located at the most northwest dock.
The remaining three stations were located 10 yards west of the previous station.
During 1998 and 1999 only one set of samples was collected from the northwest shoreline.
The remaining samples were collected on the southeast shoreline where frog surveys were conducted.
One set of stations on the southeast shoreline started at the southernmost dock, were evenly spaced along the shoreline and ended near the south bog adjacent to the small trench.
The second set of stations was evenly spaced within the trench as illustrated in Figure 8.
16 LARVAL FIELDWORK Fieldwork began in early spring in 1997, 1998 and 1999.
Field staff visited sites in early-mid April looking for signs of breeding (mating chorus, frog presence and egg masses).
After locating egg masses, field staff documented the physical location using a global positioning system (GPS), depth and total number of egg masses.
Locating eggs at the northern sites proved to be more challenging due to timing, travel time and access to the site.
During the spring of 1999, frog reproductive activity was variable due to varying weather patterns.
Eggs were difficult to find and were not laid as close in time or location as in previous years.
Methodology The larval survey goal in 1997 was to collect 100 leopard frog (Rana pipiens) larvae at each of the intensive sites.
Funnel traps proved to be time-consuming and inefficient.
Dip netting (12" butterfly nets with a 36" aluminum handle) was a fast and easy method for larvae collection.
In order to prevent contamination between sites, dedicated dip nets were allocated to each site.
Thick vegetation and other substrate hampered larval searches.
Size data (body length and total length) and abnormalities were recorded for each animal (Appendix D).
Different survey methodologies were established in 1998 and 1999.
The focus was to monitor larval development from egg to metamorph.
Dedicated dip nets were used to collect 30 leopard frog larvae.
Larval surveys started once free swimming larvae were observed, about 3 to 4 weeks after egg-laying, and continued on a bi-weekly basis until all larvae metamorphosed.
Larval development was monitored to compare growth rates between sites.
Measurements collected during larval surveys included body length (from oral sucker to posterior end of visceral mass), total length (oral sucker to end of tail) and developmental stage as described by Taylor and Kollros, 1940 (used in 1998) and Gosner, 1960 (used in 1999).
To determine growth rates for each site, all 1998 developmental-stage data were translated into the corresponding stage in Gosner, 1960.
Researchers attempted to seine and use funnel traps but these methods proved inefficient and difficult in wetland systems.
Results The following is a description of larval surveys conducted at each site.
Although larval surveys were attempted at all 7 sites, only 3 sites produced full data sets.
These data from LMS, NEY and ROI can be found in Table 3.
Summary data for all other sites are found under the descriptive paragraph for each site.
NEY - This pond contains a large breeding population of leopard frogs.
Due to different field methods during the three years discussed in this report, data may not coincide completely.
However, at NEY, data was collected all three years.
The larvae at NEY exhibited a peculiar behavior.
Larvae would periodically pop their bodies out of the water gulping for air.
Larvae behave in this way to increase oxygen consumption.
However, dissolved oxygen levels in this pond were relatively high so this behavior seemed out of the ordinary (Appendix A- Table 1).
Perhaps this coincided with the internal transformation from external gills to lungs.
17 In 1998, the larvae seemed to be developing at a much slower rate than at the other sites, evidenced by larval presence on September 16.
During the 1999 field season the latest date larvae were captured was August 30.
There was no evidence of late breeding frogs that could account for these late-developing individuals.
Breeding calls, egg masses and large, adult females were observed only in the early spring, never on subsequent site visits.
BUR - Several egg masses were found at this site.
However, leopard frog larval collections were unsuccessful.
Only American toad (Bufo americanus) larvae were found with four hours of search effort.
The third and last survey (6/25/98) was successful with respect to getting data on leopard frog larvae.
However, it was already late in the season and the first metamorphs were also found at this time.
During this survey 17 larvae were caught with an average body length of 2.67 centimeters.
BOE In 1997 and 1999, larvae were found in only one survey each year.
Ironically, they were both conducted during the same calendar week.
In 1997, the survey was conducted on 6/26/97 and resulted in 45 leopard frog larvae with an average body length of 2.49 centimeters.
The 1999 survey was conducted on 6/28/99 with only 20 leopard frog larvae captured and an average body length of 2.89 centimeters.
Although these surveys were conducted during the same time period, comparisons cannot be drawn due to the limited data set ROI - This site had an abundant leopard frog population.
At least three larval surveys were conducted in 1998 and 1999 before metamorphosis.
As with the NEY site, larvae exhibited "breaching" behavior in all three years, periodically popping their heads out of the water gasping for air.
However, the dissolved oxygen levels were very low at this site so the behavior was probably a behavioral response to increase oxygen consumption (Appendix A- Table 1).
LMS - This wetland supported an abundant leopard frog population.
The larvae at this site also exhibited the gulping behavior in 1997 and 1998.
Dissolved oxygen levels were fairly high (~6mg/L).
This once again raises questions as to why these larvae need to increase oxygen consumption.
In 1998 only three surveys were conducted before metamorphosis.
LMS had the fastest developing larvae in addition to being the largest.
LMS was the first site to produce metamorphs on June 23, 1998.
CWB- Egg masses were not found all three years and very few larvae were actually captured.
Not all larvae found were leopard frog larvae.
Other species included mink and green frog larvae (R. septentrionalis and R. clamitans).
For these two reasons there is limited data on leopard frog larvae.
The following is summary data on the leopard frog larvae from three surveys in 1999: June 3, N= 4, average body length of 1.07 centimeters; on June10, N= 3, average body length of 1.30 centimeters; and on June 30, N= 12, average body length of 2.40 centimeters.
MHL- Larval surveys were initially conducted in the trench-like area where leopard frog eggs were originally thought to have been laid.
Once larvae were identified as wood frog larvae, surveys were conducted in the lake itself.
Mink, green, and leopard frog larvae were all 18 collected while conducting surveys in the lake.
The only survey that produced data on leopard frog larvae was on July 14, 1998.
This data consisted of six larvae with an average body length of 3.25 centimeters.
The most complete sets of larval data were obtained from NEY, LMS and ROI. LMS had the greatest average body length (see Tables 3 
Growth rates were calculated at these sites (Figure 10) for 1998 by subtracting the average length at the peak of larval growth by the average length at the start of the measuring season.
This resulted in the average increase in length over the time surveyed.
This length was then divided by the number of days to the peak of larval growth, resulting in a growth rate of cm/day.
The average larval body lengths from the 1998 surveys are located in Table 5.
LMS had the fastest growth rate at 0.08 cm/day, ROI was at 0.04 cm/day and NEY was at 0.02 cm/day.
Since LMS had the largest average body length and the fastest growth rate, these frogs were the first to metamorphose.
Metamorphs were found at LMS on 6/25/98, at NEY on 7/8/98 and at ROI 7/7/98.

6 5 4 3 2 1 0 NEY ROI LMS Dates A more accurate measure of variability in larval development over time is to compare average body lengths at each developmental stage (Gosner, 1960).
These data are shown in Figure 11.
Abnormalities in early stages of development are difficult to detect.
Therefore, the data in this table represent both normal and abnormal larvae surveyed from a given site.
T-tests compared the means between paired sites.
The NEY site 20 has an overall longer body length than the two reference sites (BOE 
LMS larvae had significantly longer body lengths than ROI at stages 39, 40 and 41 (p: 0.000, 0.000 and 0.000 respectively).
Comparing all affected site R. pipiens lengths to the reference site R. pipiens lengths showed significant differences at stage 37 (p: 0.011- affected sites longer), stage 41 (p: 0.000- reference sites longer), stage 42 (p: 0.040- affected sites longer) and stage 43 (p: 0.003-reference sites longer).
These data are found in Table 6.
There was insufficient data from CWB and MHL for statistical comparison.
Figure 11.
Graph comparing stage of development (Gosner, 1960) with average log body lengths of R. pipiens at two affected sites (ROI 
From this data set, this takes place in later developmental stages (ie- stage 38).
However, data from all stages is required to accurately analyze growth rates throughout the life cycle.
The significance between affected sites and reference sites is attributed to the huge larvae from LMS.

Discussion This study shows significant differences in growth and overall size in larvae between sites.
Many factors influence amphibian development.
For example, a higher growth rate at one site compared to another might implicate food as a limiting factor.
Competition from other larvae, egg-laying success rates and predation pressures are examples of natural causes that might affect the food supply.
Or perhaps there is some agent (natural or human made) at the site causing a delay in growth rates.
Larvae at the NEY site were observed as late as September 16, 1998.
With no evidence of late reproduction, the question is raised about the cause of this possible developmental delay.
For these reasons it is important to try to understand why there are differences in growth rates between sites.
This data set is far from complete due to difficulties in surveying larvae each season.
This is primarily due to site characteristics and availability of field staff.
Surveys in 1997 started later and sample sizes were smaller.
In 1999, the LMS site was nearly dry so the overall population was depressed.
The only sites with consistent data (30 larvae per visit) were NEY and ROI.
Enclosure studies would improve collection efficiency by making recapture easier and allowing development to be monitored more closely.
However, there are many complexities related to enclosures and a large time investment.
The developmental stage length data covers a small portion of larval development (stages 3745).
At sites where larvae metamorphose simultaneously (within ~2 weeks), obtaining a large, representative sample size for each stage requires weekly visits to each site and a large catch of larvae (
Several stages (usually 5 or more) were present in each survey attempt.
Larval development through the stages occurs at a rate of ~2 stages per week.
A more detailed study involving 2 site visits per week at each site would provide a clear picture of larval stage differences between sites.
22 JUVENILE FIELDWORK Methodology Two types of juvenile surveys were conducted in 1997, intensive surveys and global surveys.
Intensive surveys were conducted at sites surveyed in the past where there were plans for more focused research efforts (chemical analysis, specimen collections and hydrological characterization).
Global surveys were designed to determine the frequency of malformations at sites where citizens reported abnormal frogs.
Intensive survey goals were to capture 100 juvenile leopard frogs by search and seize methods.
Frogs were placed in either pillow sacks or buckets for measuring.
Each frog was measured for a snout-vent length (cm), weight (g) and checked for malformations.
In 1998, MPCA field staff modified the protocol to standardize effort at each site.
Search effort involved catching 100 juvenile frogs (leopard frogs or other species depending on the site) or four hours of surveyor effort (two individuals for two hours each), whichever came first.
Global surveys consisted of capturing and examining 50 frogs.
If less than five abnormal frogs were seen within a collection of 50 frogs, then all frogs were released with no measurements recorded.
If five or more frogs were abnormal an additional 50 frogs were captured.
All 100 frogs were then measured, weighed and documented for malformations (Appendix D).
This design allowed MPCA staff to make a quick assessment of amphibian populations to focus in on a few sites with higher malformation frequencies.
This sampling methodology does not provide an adequate assessment on the extent of the problem (i.e., whether or not hot spots are localized or common around the state).
An additional study should be developed to assess the distribution of this problem using a statistically randomized design.
In 1997, 1998 and 1999, surveys were focused at three paired sites (CWB 
Thus, juvenile survey effort at the three paired sites remained consistent between years.
Field staff attempted surveys on a bi-weekly rotation.
Frog weights were measured using two different methodologies.
In 1997, weights were group averages calculated by placing five metamorphs in a plastic bag attached to a spring scale (Pesola Micro-Line 60 g Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0.3%).
The weight of the bag was subtracted from the total weight and divided by the number of frogs placed in the bag, giving an average weight.
Frogs were grouped together based on normal vs. abnormal to compare abnormal and normal weights.
In 1998 and 1999, individual weights were recorded using a digital balance (ACCULAB V-600, 0.1 600g, Ã¯Â¿Â½0.1g).
If adults were captured, age class was estimated and the frogs were examined and recorded in the same manner as juveniles.
In all three years, juveniles were collected and sent to cooperating researchers with a variety of expertises.
Most frogs were sent live via next day express delivery while others were preserved at the request of the researcher (Table 1).
23 List of Species Although this research was designed and focused on the northern leopard frog, other species observed during fieldwork were documented.
Table 7 lists all species noted during visits to the study sites.
Each species was either heard calling or captured in any developmental stagelarvae, metamorph or adult.
This is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of species present at these sites.

Malformation frequencies varied from year to year and from survey to survey (Appendix C-Table 1).
Frequencies at the NEY site were fairly consistent, only changing three percentage points over the three year span (6-9%).
The three reference sites were also fairly consistent between years, only ranging from 0% to 7%.
The ROI site had the largest difference in percent malformations by year ranging from 5% to 23%.
At this site there was no increase in percent malformed over the years, nor was there a decrease in sample size over time.
CWB showed the next largest difference in percent malformations by year ranging from 4% to 21%.
However, the low end of this range (4%) was observed in 1999 when the sample size was considerably smaller than previous years.
This site had a significant decrease in the frog population as measured by an increased unit of effort per caught frog.

First, sites were compared averaging data across years.
This resulted in a significant difference (p:0.000) in the percent malformations between sites.
Second, the percent malformations at all sites were added together by year.
Chi squared analysis comparing total malformed frogs observed by year showed significant differences between years (p:0.000).
Although both of these analyses showed significant differences between sites and years, these results may be misleading.
Since there were an uneven number of reference sites compared to affected sites, and not all sites have the same number of years of data, it is not telling the true story.
Therefore another Chi 25 squared analysis was conducted on the three affected sites which had data for all three years.
Here again we see a significant difference between sites (p:0.000).
Percent malformations from the NEY site are significantly different than ROI and CWB.
The percent malformation at CWB and ROI are not significantly different from each other.
Leopard frogs were the most abundant species at the southern sites (NEY, BOE, BUR, ROI and LMS).
However, mink and green frogs (Rana septentrionalis and Rana clamitans) were more abundant at the northern sites (MHL and CWB).
Mink and green frogs have aquatic lifestyles and are usually found in lakes and streams.
The larvae of these frogs usually overwinter and metamorphose during the second summer after egg-laying (Viparina 
These sites are attractive habitat as they are large, permanent bodies of water.
MHL is a 35-acre dimictic lake.
CWB is a monomictic body of water hydrologically similar to a large pond.
Since these two sites support populations of mink and green frogs it is important to show the frequencies of malformations in these species.
Table 9 contains the number and percent malformed juvenile frogs of each species caught by year.
The MPCA does not have data for these species at CWB in 1997 because our contract with Dr. David Hoppe was to conduct leopard frog field surveys at this site and time.

CWB had a high frequency of malformations in the mink frogs, from 60-75%.
The green frog frequencies were similar to the leopard frog frequencies but the sample size was too small to analyze statistically.
There was a large difference in malformation frequencies when comparing the mink and leopard frogs (green frogs were excluded due to inadequate sample size) at CWB.
There appears to be a correlation between the amount of time spent in the water as larvae and malformation frequency, mink frogs having the longer developmental period.
26 CWB experienced large die-off events in each of the three years studied.
These die-offs happened around the same time each year (late June-early July), affecting both amphibians and fish (Pimephales promelas and Culaea inconstans).
There are concerns about population declines at this site due to these die-off events in combination with the high malformation rates.
Population numbers appear to be declining when looking at total number of frogs caught each year.
Survey effort remained the same over the three years, but catch success was greatly reduced (success determined by survey time per caught frog).
Catch success dropped from 17.6 frogs/hour in 1998 to 9.2 frogs/hour in 1999.
This die-off event could be a result of something natural (virus/parasite), a chemical (natural or synthesized), lethal internal malformations, or a combination of these.
To investigate this mortality, deceased frogs and larvae were sent to Dr. David Green at the USGS-BRD NWHC in Madison, Wisconsin for viral and other epidemiological analyses.
Viruses were isolated from three species of frogs (Rana pipiens, Rana septentrionalis and Rana clamitans).
In each of the three years, a virus was isolated from at least one frog species at CWB.
The only other site with a confirmed isolated ranavirus from leopard frogs was at CLE (Chisago County) in 1997.
A possible virus-infected leopard frog was collected from MHL in Crow Wing County in 1998.
However, this was determined by a histological examination of the organs and not by cell culture.
The histological examination of the organs was consistent with other reports of this virus, but the virus itself was not isolated.
This ranavirus is a likely causative agent for these die-offs, but it is yet to be determined if other causes are at work.
Looking at malformation rate trends over time might give some insight into differences between sites.
Perhaps different insults or the timing of the insults affect the amphibians at each site by influencing the time in which malformed frogs emerge.
Figures 12-14 illustrate the three main affected sites and the percent of malformations by survey date from 1997-1999.
Frogs were not marked so individuals may have been caught more than once.
Figure 12 (below) illustrates a general trend of increasing malformation rates over time at the NEY pond in 1997 and 1999.
However, 1998 frequencies hit a peak in late August and then decreased.

The pattern of percent malformations compared by years resulted in a significant difference (p: 0.02).
Pairwise comparisons of the years showed a significant difference only between 1998 and 1999 (p: 0.009).
It is Time Period 27 unknown whether or not this increasing frequency trend is a result of a concentrating effect (the normal frogs disperse after metamorphosis to feed in the fields) or if there truly is a delayed development where the abnormal frogs metamorphose later in the field season.
ROI frequencies peaked in early August in 1997 and 1998 with a gradual decline the rest of the season (Figure 13).
However, 1999 surveys revealed low malformation rates throughout the season.

There is a steady positive trend in the percent malformed frogs over time in 1997 and 1998 (Figure 14).
However, the sample size of leopard frogs was very small in 1999 (n=28 from 5 survey dates).
Unfortunately, juvenile leopard frog survey data is less complete than the Time Period 28 other affected sites.
No statistical analyses could be run with such a small set of data.
This does not mean that surveys were a waste of time.
In fact, it is exactly the opposite.
Amount of survey time per caught frog increased over the two seasons MPCA surveyed this site, indicating a decrease in the population size.
CWB is a unique study site for three reasons: 1) it had a large percentage of malformed frogs, 2) the types of malformations were severe and unlike other sites, and 3) it also had a dramatic decrease in population size over the study period.
In addition to these leopard frog characteristics, it is even more disheartening that these same three points are true in other frog species, mink and green frogs.
Data from the three-paired sites on the number of juvenile leopard frogs caught per survey date and the number of malformed frogs can be found in APPENDIX C, Table 1.
Malformation Types As shown above, malformation frequencies vary between sites.
Therefore, it is important to take a closer look at the types of malformations displayed at each site.
Table 10 breaks down the number of each type of malformation observed in juvenile leopard frogs by site and year.
The table also illustrates the total number of malformations at each site by year.
Frogs may have more than one type of malformation, so the total number of malformations may not be the same as the total number of malformed frogs.
Definitions for the types of malformations can be found in APPENDIX B (Wise 1997 and Meteyer 1999).
Table 11 represents malformation types at CWB and MHL for mink and green frogs.
Figure 15 (below) shows the number of malformations (averaged across years) for each site.
Although these sites show some similarity in the types of malformations, closer examination shows that each site varies uniquely.
For example, comparing the malformation types with five or more occurrences, NEY represents the broadest effect with 11 types of malformations in this range, followed by ROI with seven and CWB with five.
ROI's malformations consist of ectromelia of the femur, tibiafibula and tarsals, ectrodactyly/brachydactyly and muscle atrophy, which are all types of missing or partial limbs.
The majority of malformations at CWB consist of skin webbing, polymelia, ectrodactyly/brachydactyly and abnormal spine (also see Gardiner 
NEY malformations include cranio-facial abnormalities in addition to those seen at CWB and ROI with the exception of skin webbing.
It is unknown whether these differences in malformation types between sites result from a common insult occurring at different times during larval development or a completely different set of insults altogether.

Chi square analysis showed that the malformation types were significantly different between sites (p
These differences between sites are attributed to four types of malformations: skin webbing, polymelia, ectrodactyly/brachydactyly and jaw abnormalities.
Larval surveys (as described in larval section) at the NEY pond documented leopard frog larvae as late as 9/16/98.
This is not an unnatural occurrence, as some leopard frog larvae will overwinter in a larval state under certain environmental situations.
However, this investigation documented perimetamorph leopard frogs (frogs in metamorphic climax as evidenced by tails not yet completely resorbed) as late as 10/13/98.
Late metamorphosing frogs did not appear fit enough to migrate to their over-wintering site due to the small body size and lack of muscle in the limbs (field observation).
Along with this observation, more severe malformation types (extra legs, cranio-facial abnormalities, partial or missing hind limbs) appeared later in the season at this site (field observations).
This may be in part due to a concentrating effect on the population when normal individuals disperse into the field to feed and begin migration back to the over-wintering site or if these more severe malformations appear in frogs that metamorphose later in the season.
If the latter is true, this seasonal variation in the types of 33 malformations represented may result from increased exposure to a given insult while in the larval state.
Comparisons of malformation types throughout the season at NEY in perimetamorphs were not possible due to the small sample size.
So, average lengths for all perimetamorphs and frogs caught and measured in the first full intensive survey (3.2 cm) as a rough cutoff point for discerning newly metamorphosed frogs throughout the entire season.
These malformation types were divided into early metamorphs (July 1- Aug. 16) or late metamorphs (Aug. 17- Oct. 31).
These data are found in Table 12.
There are more malformation types and a higher incidence within each malformation type in the late metamorphs vs. early metamorphs.
More severe malformation types are displayed in the late metamorphosing leopard frogs such as abnormal jaws, ectromelia of hind limb and amelia.
The sample number is inadequate for a statistical analysis of this data set, but it is important to look at these general observations when determining the likelihood of a given insult.

Table 13 displays the seasonal variation in the malformation types found in all abnormal leopard frogs from ROI.
These data are separated by months due to the adequate sample size.
The data suggests there is no difference in malformation types throughout the season.
This could be a result of the site characteristics.
The last perimetamorphs recorded were from the 3rd week in July all three years.
There is no additional input to the total number of malformations from this site after July.
Malformation frequencies reach a peak near the end of July into the beginning of August and gradually taper.
This could be a result of the removal of abnormal frogs for cooperating researchers.

Weight Comparison MPCA field staff documented weights of juvenile frogs to look at differences between sites and between normal and abnormal frogs.
Six of the seven sites have an overall difference between normal juveniles' weights and abnormal juveniles' weights, with abnormal frogs having an overall lower weight than normal frogs (Table 14).
However, abnormal newly metamorphosed frogs have an overall greater weight than the normal newly metamorphosed frogs at CWB.
This difference at the CWB site is significant only at a 90% confidence level.
This is probably due to the higher incidence of the types of malformations found at this site: multiple limbs and skin webbing.
These malformations have additional mass due to extra appendages or ectodermal tissue.
ROI, is the only site with significant differences in average weight between normal juveniles and abnormal juveniles (p: 0.00).
There are two or more reasons for weight differences at this site.
First, most of the malformations at this site are missing or partial hind limbs.
This in itself accounts for a loss of mass.
In addition, these malformed frogs most likely have a more difficult time feeding and are less successful capturing prey, reducing their potential to gain weight at the same rate as healthy frogs.

38 Discussion Amphibian population dynamics of normal and abnormal frogs are interesting in this research project.
This study shows significant differences in the malformation frequencies between sites and also between the affected and reference sites.
There are insults at the affected sites (CWB, NEY and ROI) that are either not present in the reference sites, are considerably elevated or appear at a critical time in frog development.
Malformation frequencies vary widely within seasons and between seasons.
The NEY pond varies from 1% in early July to 18% in early October.
Comparing the data between years shows the overall rate ranging from 6% to 9%.
Further work needs to define the population dynamics to determine if there is a concentrating effect at the end of the season due to dispersion of normal frogs.
Conversely, there could be developmental delay at this site where more severe abnormalities appear later in the season.
Mark and recapture studies were used in the 2000 fields season to determine if frogs were captured more than once in a given season.
The ROI site shows similar variance where the seasonal variation ranges from 5% to 45% and the yearly variation from 5% to 23%.
However, a different trend was observed from the NEY site.
All frogs metamorphose out of this site in mid to late July.
The highest abnormality frequencies were observed at this time with a gradual taper through the rest of the season.
This is a very small pond visited by several birds, raccoons and snakes.
The frequency decline may be explained by increased predation on the abnormal frogs from reduced mobility.
The differences in malformation types displayed vary by site.
CWB has a high percentage of skin webbings and extra appendages, ROI has a high percentage of ectromelic limbs and NEY has a wide range of abnormalities including cranio-facial abnormalities.
Site differences in malformation types undoubtedly are caused either by the timing of an insult or different combinations of insults.
The next step in this process is to incorporate laboratory work defining the teratogenicity of synthetic and natural chemicals.
Once these activities are defined, the next step would be to figure out the effects under natural settings.
There are many compounding interactions in natural landscapes compared with the laboratory so experiments should take into account both general water quality (ionic strength, pH, DOC, etc.) and additional influences such as parasites and ultraviolet radiation.
Further work needs to define the characteristics of each site and combine those results with lab tests to determine the likelihood of a given insult.
39 Citizen Reports The MPCA first responded to a report of malformed frogs in 1993 in Western Minnesota near Granite Falls.
MPCA staff Judy Helgen and Mark Gernes and staff from the MDNR investigated the report.
Surveys of frog populations in the area turned up three malformed frogs in 1993.
The PCA followed up on this report in 1994, surveying several wetlands near the reported site, but found no malformed frogs.
Then, in August of 1995, a group of middle-school students from Henderson found a high number of malformed frogs at the NEY pond while on a nature hike.
Once again, MPCA staff responded by conducting surveys at this pond.
They confirmed a high frequency of malformations at this site, thrusting the MPCA into a full-scale investigation.
As news of this finding spread, the MPCA began receiving calls from citizens, and staff began documenting each report for possible future studies.
In 1995, the MPCA received 14 citizen reports of abnormal frogs, representing 12 counties.
MPCA field workers visited a handful of these reported sites, confirming the malformations at each.
There was also one case where a citizen reported all frogs observed were normal.
Public awareness of this phenomenon reached a peak in 1996 due to an enormous amount of media coverage.
Once the frogs began to metamorphose in early to mid-July, the number of reports increased dramatically.
In 1996 alone, there were 180 citizen reports of abnormal frogs representing 53 counties.
MPCA field workers visited several of these sites in 1996 to confirm the malformations and found several sites with very high rates of malformation.
There were also 14 reports, representing 11 counties, where all observed frogs appeared normal.
During 1997, the MPCA continued documenting citizen reports.
Citizen awareness of the problem remained high, as evidenced by the continual reports of malformed frog locations flooding in to the MPCA.
Tracking them became an overwhelming task, with a total of 185 calls representing 48 counties.
There were four additional abnormal reports from 1997 in which a county was not identified.
Staff continued to document these calls while a field crew of biologists traveled to a number of these sites to confirm the reports.
In addition to these reports, there were two reports of all-normal frogs from two different counties.
In 1998 and 1999 the citizen reports were processed by Hamline University's "Thousand Friends of Frogs" program, which works in partnership with the MPCA.
In 1998, a total of 88 abnormal frog reports representing 44 counties were received.
In addition, there were 24 reports of normal frogs representing 15 counties.
(The increased number of "normal" reports is most likely due to the spread of the messaged that reports of all-normal frogs are valuable as well.)
In 1999, the MPCA received only 31 abnormal frog reports representing 20 counties, and normal frog report.
Since the MPCA was observing no decrease of malformation rates at study sites, the drop in the number of citizen reports was believed to be due to a decrease media coverage of the story, or to people assuming if they had called once they shouldn't one its in call 40 again.
Information about where to report malformations was provided in periodic update letters sent to involved and concerned citizens and county water planners, and was also posted on the MPCA's web site.
Overall from 1995 through 1999, the MPCA received 544 reports representing 68 Minnesota counties.
This data is located in table 18 below.
The MPCA will continue to document these reports in 2000 as they are called in throughout the season.

These data can be found in Table 1, in Appendix A.
During all three years water samples were collected and sent to the Minnesota Department of Health to be analyzed.
Results on total ammonia nitrogen, total chloride, chlorophyll a, color, total kjeldahl nitrogen, total nitrite, pheophytin a, total phosphorus, suspended solids, sv solids, total alkalinity and total dissolved organic carbon can be found in Table 2, in Appendix A. 46 NEW COUNTRY SCHOOL PARTICIPATION The students from the LeSueur-based New Country School who discovered the malformed frogs at the NEY pond in 1995 are still working with the MPCA Malformed Frog Investigation field staff.
In the fall of 1999, the school kids took part in a joint effort with the MPCA field staff to document the migration of leopard frogs from a study site to the frogs over-wintering location.
The combined effort of the MPCA field staff and the New County School students installed drift fences and funnel traps adjacent to one of the study ponds in September of 1999.
The goal was to document the direction of migration and to also see if any abnormal juvenile leopard frogs were attempting the migration to the over-wintering location.
The students took on the responsibility of monitoring the traps on a two-day rotation.
When frogs were captured the students documented the snout-vent length, weight, description of any malformations observed and then released the frogs on the opposite side of the fence.
Working together has proven to be a success.
With the students being so close to the sites they were able to monitor and observe events that the MPCA staff could not because of the distance and other duties.
Plans are under way to continue this joint endeavor in the spring of 2000 to see how many frogs return to the pond, and to see if any malformed frogs survived the winter.

Polymelia: Supernumerary limbs.
Polydactyly/Polyphalangy: Supernumerary digits or digital elements.
Phocomelia: Reduced or absence of proximal portion of limb, with the paws being attached to the trunk of the body.
Ectromelia of Femur: Absence of limb beyond the femur.
The femur is incomplete.
Ectromelia of Tibiafibula: Absence of limb beyond the tibiafibula.
The tibiafibula is incomplete.
Ectromelia of Tarsals (tibiale and fibulare): Absence of foot beyond the tibiale fibulare bones typically with shortening of the tibiale and fibulare.
Ectrodactyly/Brachydactyly: Absence of one or more digits or digital elements.
Rotation: Distally complete but malformed limb, limb at unusual angle due to long bone rotation.
Bone Bridge/Triangles: Distally complete but malformed limb, long bones are bent forming a triangle.
Skin Web: Distally complete but malformed limb, skin fussing proximal and distal portion of leg crossing a joint.
Micromelia: Distally complete but malformed limb, bones all present, but shortened Muscle atrophy: Bone structure complete but muscle mass reduced.
