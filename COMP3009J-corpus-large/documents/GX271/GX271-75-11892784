North I-25 Front Range EIS Denver Union Station to S.H. 14 (Fort Collins) PART I --- PROJECT INFORMATION (GENERAL) The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) are the lead agencies for the EIS/Basic Engineering study in cooperation with CDOT.
Work programs, procedures, and products are subject to FHWA and FTA review and approval.
Nothing in this Scope shall preclude federal agencies or federal officials from fulfilling their responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) or any of NEPA's implementing regulations.
Section A PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS
1.01 Planned Improvement This scope of work has been prepared to define work to be conducted for preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and a Record of Decision (ROD), under the terms of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.
Section 4321, et seq., and its implementing regulations, for transportation improvements in the North I-25 Front Range Corridor.
The Consultant's activities will examine all alternatives for improvements, including the no-action alternative.
A sufficient level of design engineering will be required to provide clear definition of the project, to identify and compare the likely positive and negative impacts and mitigation measures of various alternatives, and to ensure accurate cost estimates of each alternative.
However, in this task order contract, no task order for work beyond an approved DEIS will be issued until approval has been obtained from FHWA and, if appropriate, FTA in accordance with the NEW Starts regulations.
This project's study area includes portions of the counties of Denver, Adams, Boulder, Broomfield, Weld and Larimer.
Key aspects include but are not limited to access to jobs, goods and services, multimodal transportation alternatives, environmental justice, ROW, traffic congestion, air quality, noise, hazardous material, cumulative impacts with other projects, and public/community involvement.
5
1.02 Project Goals This project is intended to address the following items: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Corridor optimization (as defined by the State Transportation Commission) Improving safety Accommodating existing or providing new/expanded multi-modal forms of transportation, including consideration of transit-dependent travelers or others who cannot rely on single occupant vehicles Improving regional transportation mobility and connectivity between Northern Colorado communities and metropolitan Denver.
Increasing system quality
This Scope of Work has been carefully reviewed by the Department and reflects a plan of approach based on the known goals.
The Consultant must demonstrate at all times a clear understanding of and a sensitivity to the key issues listed in Section 1.01, above, and as more particularly detailed elsewhere in this Scope.
The Consultant must be flexible and cooperative in its activities, and must be willing and able to incorporate into its work plans any Work elements that CDOT may decide to have CDOT personnel perform.
The Consultant's analysis of the Project goals, its evaluation of the Work elements, and its formulation of the Work plan, coupled with its understanding of and sensitivity to the key issues listed in section 1.01, may produce new approaches or modifications to the Project's Work elements.
Because of that, the Final Scope of Work for the Project will likely incorporate input from the Consultant.
1.03 Project Location Scoping activities required by the NEPA will be conducted by the Consultant and will clarify the logical termini for this study effort.
a.
Roadway The study area is located along the existing I-25 and surrounding areas, from the Denver metropolitan area to northern Colorado communities including Fort Collins and Greely.
The study area also includes the interchanges and the associated approaches to the project.
US 287 and US 85 transportation corridors will also be included in the analysis of potential alternative route locations.
Scoping activities may also identify other route alternatives that commend evaluation and comparison with the preceding ones.
Elements included in the roadway prism may be High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, express toll/High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lanes and regular vehicle lanes.
6
b. Passenger Rail The potential passenger rail alignments and station locations from Denver Union Station (DUS) to Fort Collins and/or Greeley will be evaluated.
The North Front Range Transportation Alternatives Feasibility Study, which was a Major Investment Study (MIS) completed in 2000, set out several rail-alignment alternatives that linked surrounding cities and towns within the study area, with reference to two types of commuter rail technology: push-pull locomotives with standard passenger cars, and self-propelled "regional rail" using diesel multiple unit (DMU).
This MIS examined the following linkages to cities and towns: Â· Â· Â· Â· Fort Collins to Denver Loveland and Greeley Fort Collins to Denver Fort Collins to Denver corridor Fort Collins to Denver Boulder Union Station with optional extensions to Union Station via Greeley and Brighton Union Station, generally following the I-25 Union Station via Loveland, Longmont and
The above list is not intended to be an exclusive list of all alignments that the consultant may need to consider in the study, but merely illustrates some significant alignment possibilities that prior work efforts have highlighted.
(Note: in examining these potential routes, the Consultant must also coordinate with CDOT's Region 6, DRCOG, FTA, FRA, the railroad companies and RTD, particularly for the railroad corridor between DUS and Longmont) which is being considered in the US 36 Environmental Impact Statement.
1.04 Project Cost The estimated construction cost of this project is $1,900,000,000 (2001 dollars) for highway improvement and transit.
Additional features or alternative improvements may be identified during the EIS phase that may increase the overall cost of improvements and mitigation measures.

Section C PROJECT DESCRIPTION 3.01 General Description Proposed work covered under this contract will consist of defining, developing and evaluating alternatives of transportation improvements, including the No Action Alternative.
The alternatives of transportation improvements include highway interchange modification, reconstruction, realignment, increased capacity, accommodation of multi-modal forms of transportation including transit technologies (e.g., Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)).
Additionally, the evaluation of alternatives will include all local transportation planning organizations evaluating the US 287 and US 85 corridor improvements.
The long-term goal of this project is the examination of intra-regional transportation needs along this transportation corridor, and the generation of an EIS to identify a preferred alternative that best meets those needs, prepared in coordination with CDOT, FTA, RTD, FHWA and FRA, utilizing all necessary and appropriate NEPA documentation in the corridor, and its vicinity, that is applicable and relevant to this work.
3.02 Project Limits The project is located along the Front Range corridor of northern Colorado including the I-25 route and surrounding areas from approximately Denver Union Station to central Fort Collins or Greeley.
The consultant shall note that the southern logical termini for this study effort will be finalized through a coordinated effort involving CDOT Regions 4 and 6, RTD (and other local transit agencies) the FHWA, the FTA, and the FRA.
This will require the consideration of pending study efforts for the North I25 corridor (Denver Union Station to SH 7), the "vision plan" from the North Front Range Transportation Alternatives study, and the Finding of No Significant impact from the Environmental Assessment for I25: SH 7 to SH 66.
The consultant shall recognize that different termini may result for various alternatives as a result of the timing of the planned study activities, differing regional transportation funding formulas, and multi-modal transportation considerations.
3.03 Phases and Work Elements This project is divided into four phases: Â· Â· Scoping/Overview to compose a Purpose and Need Statement for the EIS. Highway Improvements and Passenger Rail alternative analysis and associated impacts Â­ including Basic and Preliminary Engineering.
(Note: The Consultant will not be allowed to proceed to preliminary engineering for transit until authorization from FTA is granted.)

Â· Â·
Environmental Assessment and/or Documented Categorical Exclusions Â­ for FHWA approval requirements for any immediate interchange modifications I-25 Right-of-Way Preservation Study Â­ to enable the avoidance of severe relocation costs and impacts that would otherwise result from future construction.
Action Required The goal of the EIS is to evaluate the alternatives and their associated impacts in this project location area that address the purpose and need in accordance with NEPA guidelines.
Additional aspects of a multi-modal and maximum capacity corridor build-out alternative may be considered within the EIS based on input received during the agency and public involvement processes and the reasonableness for future funding.
This will ensure that the final preferred alternative in the EIS is designed to avoid reconstruction if additional, longer-term improvements are to be completed at some future date.
Members of the consultant team shall make themselves available to meet with interested community groups and organizations.
Public information meetings and/or workshops shall be held during the development of the EIS.
Following approval on the DEIS and FEIS by CDOT, RTD, FTA, and FHWA, Public Hearings shall be held at least once in each major locality.
Major work elements for this project include: aerial photographic and ground surveys, environmental analysis and graphics for public display and distribution purposes; analysis of present and projected traffic volumes and patterns; evaluation of all types of social, economic and environmental impacts, roadway, bus transit, high occupancy vehicle (HOV) systems, express tolling lanes/high occupancy toll lanes (HOT Lanes), rail design and supporting engineering studies.
The work elements will be done with sufficient detail to support the recommendation of a preferred alternative in the EIS and to assemble a reliable cost estimate for the project implementation.
Investigations and evaluations of social, environmental and economic impacts shall be addressed in the EIS on items such as, but not limited to: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Noise/Vibration Historic Preservation Paleontological resources Land use Environmental Justice Residential and/or business relocations Transportation Impacts (highway, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian) Relocation and right-of-way Energy Social (including public safety and security) Wetlands and Aquatic Resources 14

A preliminary version of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) document will be distributed to cooperating agencies for review and comments.
Following any necessary revision of the preliminary draft the cooperating agencies will review and approve the DEIS and findings.
Upon completion, the Consultant shall provide a notice for newspaper publication of the time and location of all Public Hearings.
Sufficient copies of the DEIS document shall be prepared by the Consultant for distribution to agencies and organizations having jurisdiction in the study corridor and for being made available to the general public for its inspection and review upon advertisement of the Public Hearings.
Following the Public Hearings, preliminary and final versions of the FEIS document will be distributed, reviewed, and approved in a process identical to that previously described for the DEIS.
A Public Hearing will be held and a preliminary and final ROD will be prepared.
Project Management Plan (PMP) In anticipation of a Full-Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA), the Project may be subject to the Project Management Oversight regulation codified at 49 C.F.R. Part 15
633.
Subpart C of this regulation at Section 633.21 requires the submission of a PMP as a condition of Federal (i.e. FTA) financial assistance and contemplates that review and approval of the PMP will be part of the Grant review process.
A PMP will be prepared by the Consultant and assistance provided in preparing the Grant application.
The minimum requirements of the PMP are specified in the regulation 49 C.F.R.

Such a Study is not intended to and will not supplant or contradict any of the results of the NEPA analysis.
Â· Alternatives Analysis The following conceptual development shall be completed by the Consultant and will involve both rail and roadway alternatives: 1.)
Develop Alternatives Develop all reasonable alternatives that will satisfy the operational requirements of the project.
When required, conceptual layouts will be developed for major structures for each alternate that shows satisfaction of the required span arrangement and the horizontal and vertical clearances.
Examples of items to consider while developing alternatives are alternate routes, accident history, congestion, effects of the interchange on the existing highway system, effects on adjacent interchanges, economic development impact, local commitment to improving local roadways and construction feasibility under existing traffic.
These alternatives must respond to projected base 36
(and/or "current") year and design year traffic volumes as developed for this scope.
Evaluate the impacts of these alternative concepts and the degree to which they accomplish the objectives.
These concepts will be described schematically and narratively, and reviewed by CDOT. 2.)
Screen Alternatives A preliminary screening process will be used on the universe of alternatives to identify feasible and significantly different alternatives, which will be subject to more detailed evaluation.
The purpose of this screening is to eliminate the obviously unfeasible alternatives or concepts, or alternatives that do not meet the Purpose and Need.
The no-action alternative must be carried through the entire evaluation and assessment process.
The criteria used in the preliminary screening should include items identified in "Gather Data, Analysis, and Mitigation."
Examples of concerns used in the screening process are environmental (air, noise, water quality, and open space), historic and archaeological impacts, cost and engineering feasibility, construction staging options, transportation impacts, design year level of service and other performance measures, socioeconomic impacts and community acceptability, consistency with adopted plans, and urban design issues and opportunities.
All reasonable design alternatives will be described in a final design alternatives memorandum.
For this set of alternatives, horizontal and vertical alignment studies at a scale of 1:1000 will be examined.
3.)
Initial Design Completion Complete an initial design of the designated elements of the preferred alternative.
General profile and cross section studies will be developed for critical areas.
This information shall be sufficient to determine general cut and fill limits, right-of-way and easement requirements, and earthwork and structural requirements.
Design parameters such as design speeds, maximum grades, typical sections, intersection designs, and pedestrian routing will be determined at the beginning of the study.
The conceptual design for the roadway alignments, detours, and major structures will be completed sufficiently so that preliminary cost estimates can be developed and the satisfaction of pertinent design criteria can be demonstrated.
Necessary variances will be 37
identified.
The following shall be available following the design: a.
Typical sections and plan and profile of roadway alignment and detours b. Preliminary hydraulic recommendations c. Preliminary right-of-way requirement d. Recommended construction sequence 4.)
Financial Analysis Perform a financial analysis on the alternatives.
A capital/operating/ maintenance cost estimate will be developed.
Preliminary engineering, construction engineering, construction, and operating/maintenance for the design life will be analyzed.
Traditional funding packages identifying the funding sources necessary to construct and maintain the project will be developed, along with identifying new sources.
5.)
Additional Alternatives (Additional Analysis Requirements) Additional analysis may be added to upgrade the entire corridor to current standards as well as reviewing impacts related to the ultimate reconstruction as required to ensure maximum multimodal capacity.
Design options are anticipated to be developed for the following situations: a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. Highway widening Interchange reconfiguration Public transit station location and design Public transit maintenance facility location New interchanges Alternative alignments Demand Management Options Park-n-ride improvements and pedestrian crossings
Documentation of alternatives considered shall be done according to NEPA guidelines, and documented in the EIS.
Â· Final Alternatives Reports Complete the documentation of the alternatives.
A "Final Alternatives Report" will be submitted documenting the analysis process.
This shall include the final staging plan, socioeconomic and environmental concerns, utility conflicts, drainage, right of way requirements, and total cost for the preferred alternative.

Identify Permit Requirements 1.)
401 PERMIT A Section 401 Water Quality Certification is required in conjunction with an Individual 404 Permit (dredge and fill permit) 56
Â·
Â·
Â·
for any transportation construction project or maintenance activity where work occurs below ordinary high-water line or adjacent to wetlands.
Section 401 requires an application to obtain certification for any activity on a project that may result in a discharge of any pollutants.
2.)
402 PERMIT The 402 permitting process was established by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System to regulate the discharge of pollutants from point sources (Section 402 of the Clean Water Act).
A point discharge into state water results from discharge from sources such as dewatering operations.
Precipitation induced roadway drainage from culverts or storm drains is not considered a point source discharge.
The need for a 402 Permit should be addressed and identified in the DEIS prepared for the project.
The environmental document should address the potential adverse affects caused by point source discharges.
For Categorical Exclusion (Minor) projects, documentation in the project file is required using the Form 128, Categorical Exclusion Determination.
The Final EIS should include every reasonable effort to resolve any issues raised by other agencies regarding 402 Permits.
The CDOT Region Planning/Environmental Manager will also coordinate the Permits for Categorical Exclusion projects with all responsible offices.
The following activities will require the acquisition of a 402 Permit: a.
Construction dewatering operations associated with activities such as utility excavation, bridge pier installation, foundation or trench digging, or other subsurface activities.
b.
If discharge is expected to occur from a point source discharge from mechanical wastewater treatment plants, vehicle washing, or industrial discharges.
3.)
404 PERMIT The Section 404 Permit is used to obtain compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
57
A 404 Permit is required whenever construction projects or maintenance activities requiring dredging or filling occurs below the ordinary high-water line in any body of water considered a water of the United States (navigable waters of the United States and adjacent wetlands; all tributaries to navigable waters and adjacent wetlands; interstate waters and their tributaries and adjacent wetlands; and other waters of the United States such as isolated wetlands and lakes, intermittent streams, and prairie potholes.)
Ordinary high-water line is defined as the line of the shore established by the fluctuations of water indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank; shelving; changes in the character of the soil; destruction of terrestrial vegetation; the presence of litter and debris; or other appropriate means which consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.
The CDOT Region Planning/Environmental Manager is responsible for preparing and submitting 404 Permit applications in coordination with the Corps of Engineers.
The Region Planning/Environmental Manager will transmit the permit application and any permit stipulations required by the Corps of Engineers to affected Region and Staff offices.
Maintenance activities are also regulated.
Permits obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
There are three levels of permits, generally based on the amount and type of impact.
a.
Individual Permit: A Corps of Engineers authorization that is issued following a case-by-case evaluation of a specific project involving the proposed discharge and a determination that the proposed discharge is in the public interest.
The greater the wetland impacts on a project, the more likely that an Individual Permit will be required.
If an application for a permit cannot be addressed with a Nationwide or Regional permit, then a detailed application must be submitted requesting an Individual Permit.
A 30day public review is required.
c. Regional Permit: Permits for activities authorized by the Corps of Engineers on a regional basis.
A 15-day public review is required.
Examples of activities include minor excavations in wetlands and stream habit improvement projects.

d. Nationwide Permit: General permits that cover common design elements and/or construction activities.
Specific requirements are attached to each Nationwide Permit.
If certain conditions are met, the specified activities can take place without the need for an Individual or Regional permit.
Each Nationwide Permit contains a description of the permit and may include the size of the area that can be impacted, the quantity of allowable fill, and other relevant information.
A written pre-discharge notification of the Corps of Engineers may be required before work can begin.
The approval process for a Nationwide Permit is fairly easy; however it can take up to 45 days to receive the permit.
The Environmental study prepared for the project should identify by alternative the general location of each dredge or fill activity, and determine the impacts and proposed mitigation measures.
Construction cannot start without a signed 404 Permit.
The 404 Permit is a legally binding agreement between CDOT and the U.S. Army Corps.
This means that changes in design or changes made in the field that alter impacts cannot be made until all parties have agreed to the changes and those changes have been documented.

Hazardous substances, components, and operations shall be isolated from other activities, areas, personnel, and incompatible materials.
Equipment shall be located so that access during operations, servicing, maintenance, repair, or adjustment minimizes personnel exposure to hazards (e.g. hazardous chemicals, high voltage, electromagnetic radiation, cutting edges, or sharp points).
Risk resulting from excessive environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, noise, toxicity, acceleration, or vibration) shall be minimized.
Risk resulting from human error in system operation and support shall be minimized as part of the design effort.
In the case of risk from hazards that cannot be eliminated, alternatives that will minimize such risk shall be considered (e.g. interlocks, redundancy, fail safe design, system protection, fire suppression, and other protective measures, such as clothing, equipment, devices, and procedures).
Power sources, controls, and critical components of redundant subsystems shall be protected by physical separation or shielding, or by other suitable methods mutually agreeable to the design, RTD and NFRT
When alternate design approaches cannot eliminate the hazard, safety and warning devices and warning and cautionary notes shall be provided in assembly, operations, maintenance and repair instructions, and distinctive markings shall be provided on hazardous components, equipment, and facilities to ensure personnel and equipment protection.
These shall be standardized in accordance with commonly accepted commercial practice or, if none exists, normal procedures.
Where no such common practice exists, the design shall propose the method or methods to be used to RTD and NFR for review and approval.
The design shall provide all warnings, cautions, and distinctive markings proposed to RTD and NFR for review and comment.

b. Definition of Safety Conditions 1) Unacceptable Conditions The following safety critical conditions are considered unacceptable.
Positive action and implementation verification is required to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
Â· Single component failure, common mode failure, human error, or design features, which could cause a mishap of catastrophic or critical severity.
Â· Dual independent component failures, dual human errors, or a combination of a component failure and a human error involving safety critical command and control functions, which could cause a mishap of catastrophic or critical severity.
96
Â· Â· Â·
Generation of hazardous ionizing/non-ionizing radiation or energy when no provisions have been made to protect personnel or sensitive subsystems from damage or adverse effects.
Packaging or handling procedures and characteristics that could cause a mishap for which no controls have been provided to protect personnel or sensitive equipment.
Hazard level categories that are specified as unacceptable.
Unacceptable hazardous conditions will be identified according to the hazard resolution matrix.
Hazard classification at this level is a formal process for determining which hazards are acceptable, acceptable with review by management staff, undesirable, or unacceptable.
Hazard severity is a subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies, and/or procedural efficiencies for system, subsystem, or component failure or malfunction.
Hazard probability is defined as the probability that a specific hazard will occur during the planned life expectancy of the system element, subsystem, or component.
The categories of hazard severity, hazard probability, and their definitions follow.
Hazard Severity Definition Â· Catastrophic Â­ Death or system loss.
Â· Critical Â­ Severe injury, severe occupational illness, or major system damage.
Â· Marginal Â­ Minor injury, minor occupational illness, or minor system damage.
Â· Negligible Â­ Less then minor injury, occupational illness, or system damage Hazard Probability Definition Â· Frequent - Likely to occur frequently; continuously experienced.
Â· Probable - Will occur several times in the life of an item; will occur frequently in fleet/inventory Â· Occasional - Likely to occur sometime in the life of an item; will occur several times in fleet inventory.
Â· Remote - Unlikely but possible to occur in the life of an item; unlikely but can be expected to occur in fleet/inventory.
Â· Improbable - So unlikely, it can be assumed occurrence may not be experienced; unlikely to occur, but possible in fleet.
The following table (of the RTD System Safety Program Plan) demonstrates the relationship between severity and probability to define an unacceptable hazardous condition.
HAZARD RESOLUTION MATRIX Catastrophic (I) Frequent (A) Unacceptable Probable (B) Unacceptable Critical (II) Unacceptable Unacceptable Marginal (III) Unacceptable Undesirable Negligible (IV) Acceptable/WR Acceptable/WR
97
HAZARD RESOLUTION MATRIX Catastrophic (I) Occasional (C) Unacceptable Remote (D) Undesirable Improbable (E) Acceptable/WR Acceptable/WR means acceptable with manage
Critical (II) Undesirable Undesirable Acceptable/WR ment review.
Marginal (III) Undesirable Acceptable/WR Acceptable/WR
Negligible (IV) Acceptable Acceptable Acceptable
2) Acceptable Conditions The following approaches are considered acceptable for correcting unacceptable conditions and will require no further analysis once controlling actions are implemented and verified.
Â· For non-safety critical command and control functions; a system design that requires two or more independent human errors, or that requires two or more independent failures, or a combination of independent failure and human error.
For safety critical command and control functions; a system design that requires at least three independent failures, or three human errors, or a combination of three independent failures and human errors.
System designs which positively prevent errors in assembly, installation, or connections which could result in a mishap.
System designs, which positively prevent damage propagation from one component to another or prevent sufficient energy propagation to cause a mishap.
System design limitations on operation, interaction, or sequencing that preclude occurrence of a mishap.
System designs that provide an approved safety factor, or fixed design allowance which limit, to an acceptable level, possibilities of structural failure or release of energy sufficient to cause a mishap.
System designs that control energy build-up which could potentially cause a mishap (fuses, relief valves, electrical explosion proofing, etc.).
System designs in which component failure can be temporarily tolerated because of residual strength or alternate operating paths so that operations can continue with a reduced but acceptable safety margin.
System designs that positively alert the controlling personnel to a hazardous situation for which the capability for operator reaction has been provided.
System designs which limit/control the use of hazardous materials.

In applying resolution to identified hazards, the Consultant shall utilize the following system safety precedence: Â· Â· Â· Â· design for minimum risk, incorporate safety devices, provide warning devices, and Develop procedures and training.
d. Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) The Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) activity is the engineering function, which is performed to identify the hazards and their preliminary casual factors of the system in development.
The hazards are formally documented to include information regarding the description of the hazard, casual factors, the effects of the hazard, and preliminary design considerations for hazard control by mitigating each cause.
Performing the analysis includes assessing hazardous components, safety-related interfaces between subsystems, environmental constraints, operation, test and support activities, emergency procedures, test and support facilities, and safety-related equipment and safeguards.
The analysis also provides an initial assessment of hazard severity and probability of occurrence.
The probability assessment at this point is usually subjective and qualitative.
To support the tasks and activities of a safety effort, the "causes" of the root hazard must be assessed and analyzed.
These causes should be separated in four separate categories: Â· Hardware initiated causes 99
Â· Â· Â·
Software initiated causes Human error initiated causes Human error causes that were influenced by software input to the user/operator
The Consultant shall conduct a PHA process for the Project.
