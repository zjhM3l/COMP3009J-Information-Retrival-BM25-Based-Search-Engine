Delaware Duck Stamp Program 2003 Delaware Duck Stamp The Ring-Necked Duck by Jeffrey Klinefelter of Etna Green, Indiana
Beginning with black ducks painted by Ned Mayne in 1980, the first year of Delaware's waterfowl art competition, 24 of the State's waterfowl species have adorned the annual stamp that is required of waterfowl hunters and prints that are collected by conservationists.
Those species are the black duck, snow goose, blue goose, atlantic brant, lesser scaup, redhead, Canada goose, canvasback, mallard, gadwall, pintail, baldpate, wood duck, bufflehead, green-winged teal, hooded merganser, shoveler , American goldeneye, white-winged scoter, whistling swan, blue-wing teal, long-tailed duck (formerly old squaw), ruddy duck, and the ring-necked duck.
The Division of Fish 
T o date, more than $2.0 million has been raised.
These funds improve water fowl habitat in Delaware and Canada.
This conservation effort helps to ensure that waterfowl species will prosper and provide enjoyment for gen erations to come.
Thank you for your support! Stamps and prints from 2001, 2002, and 2003 are available for sale to collectors.
After June 30, 2004, the 2001 prints and stamps will be destroyed in accordance with Duck Stamp Program policy.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION HARVEST INFORMATION PROGRAM Â­ H.I.P.
In 2003, all Delaware migrator y bird hunters (including non-resident and license exempt) will have to register with the Federal Harvest Information Program.
Migratory birds include ducks, geese, mourning doves, woodcock, rails, snipe, and coots.
To register, Delaware hunters can call toll free 1-877-DELAHIP (1-877-335-2447).
THIS IS A NEW NUMBER FOR 2003.
Hunters may also register for HIP via the internet at www.dnrec.state.de.us/fw.
You'll be asked to provide your name, address, birth date and answer a few short questions about your last year's hunting success.
Hunters will get their H.I.P. registration number over the phone so have a pencil and paper ready.
If you have problems getting your number, call toll free 1-800-368-4683.
As in the past, duck and goose hunters will still have to have the Federal and State duck stamps.
See page 31 for more information about H.I.P.
NEW DEER CHECKING SYSTEM In 2002, the Division implemented the new automated phone-in and internet deer checking system.
By calling toll free 1-877-335-2447 (NEW NUMBER FOR 2003), or by going to www.dnrec.state.de.us/fw hunters may now officially register their deer without going to a check station.
Hunters will answer a series of questions by using the telephone or computer keypad.
For example, all hunters will be asked what county they got the deer in.
Private land hunters will be asked what deer management zone they got the deer in.
Public land hunters will be asked what public area they were hunting in.
At the end of the questions, hunters will be given a deer harvest registration number.
Since call-in hunters will not receive tags or harvest record forms for their deer, this registration number will serve as proof the animal was checked.
If you have problems with this system call 1-800-368-4683.
Hunters that take their deer to a butcher shop that is not a check station will have to give their phone-in registration number to the butcher shop as proof the deer was officially registered.
The in-person deer checking option at various stores will still be available for those preferring to register deer that way.
A list of these stations can be found on page 11.
Because of the new phone-in system, the State-run check station at the Middletown Highway Yard will be closed during all seasons.
The Ommelanden Hunter Education Training Center on Rt. 9 in New Castle will only check deer during normal business hours during the Archery, December Antlerless, January Shotgun and January Muzzleloader seasons.
No deer will be checked at this facility during the October Muzzleloader and November Shotgun Seasons.
RESIDENT DEER TAGS In 2003, Delaware hunting licenses will come with 2 Antlerless Tags.
Hunter's Choice Tags are now available for $10 and come with a Quality Buck Tag attached to it at no extra charge.
The Hunter's Choice Tag can be used on an antlerless or antlered deer.
The Quality Buck Tag can only be used on an antlered deer with a minimum outside spread of 15".
Hunters will only be allowed to harvest a maximum of 2 antlered bucks (all seasons combined) by using the Hunter's Choice Tag and the Quality Buck Tag.
All other deer taken must be antlerless.
License exempt hunters will be allowed 2 antlerless deer and 1 Hunter's Choice deer at no charge.
For a Quality Buck Tag, license exempt hunters will have to purchase the combination Hunter's Choice/Quality Buck Tag.
For license exempt hunters, the Hunter's Choice Tag will be invalid.
This new tag system is being implemented to encourage hunters to harvest antlerless deer and to promote Quality Deer Management.
Revenue will be used to fund the phone-in deer registration system and to further improve Delaware's deer management program Page 4
NEW NON-RESIDENT DEER TAGS Â· Beginning in 2003, the cost of an Antlered Deer Tag and a Quality Buck Tag will be $25 each for non-resident hunters.
Hunters may purchase only one of each tag.
Non-resident hunting licenses will come with 2 Antlerless Tags.
CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE Â· Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease that has been found in whitetailed deer and other members of the deer family in several western and mid-western states.
It appears to be always fatal for deer.
There is no evidence that it can be transmitted to humans.
Delaware will begin an active CWD surveillance program during the 2003 deer hunting season.
Hunters will be asked to bring deer heads (except for fawns) to collection points.
The target sample size will be 300 heads.
Heads will be tagged and the hunter's name and address recorded.
The samples will be taken to a processing lab where the appropriate tissues will be extracted for testing.
Collection locations and schedules will be publicized in the press and on the Division's web site.
SHARPS RIFLE Â· Beginning in 2003, hunters may use a single shot antique or authentic reproduction black powder Sharps rifle of 45 to 60 caliber using paper patched bullets for hunting deer during any shotgun deer season.
STATE WATERFOWL STAMP Â· The cost of the State Waterfowl Stamp will be $9.00 beginning with the 2003 waterfowl season.
PRIME HOOK NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE Â· To obtain a preseason deer hunting application or additional hunting information for Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, please visit their website at or call (302) 684-8419.

DELAWARE SPORTSMEN AGAINST HUNGER, INC. Project Objectives and History Throughout the country hunters are sharing their harvest with hungry people.
Although this sharing has been a tradition since pioneer days, in recent years the practice has become more organized.
The idea is being sponsored on a national basis by Safari Club International's project named "Spor tsmen Against Hunger" and BUCKMASTERS "Project Venison."
In Delaware a coalition of sporting groups and charities are joining forces to feed hungry people.
BUCKMASTERS provides the primary financial support for the project.
The Salvation Army serves as a clearinghouse for donations of meat and money from hunters.
These contributions will be distributed throughout the state to cooperating charitable groups.
Volunteers will pick up frozen packages of venisonburger from participating butcher shops.
Only licensed shops are eligible in order to protect the quality of the meat.
Donations of meat directly from hunters cannot be accepted.
Butcher shops will wrap the meat in two pound packages without any additives of fat, spices, seasonings, etc.
A record of all donations will be kept in order to recognize donors.
Hunters that are not lucky enough to harvest a deer are encouraged to help the project by donating money to the project.
The money will be used to pay for direct program expenses and to buy additional food.
No donations will be used for "administrative" expenses.
If you would like to volunteer to help DELAWARE SPORTSMEN AGAINST HUNGER, contact the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife or the Dover Corps, Salvation Army.
WHY CHECK DEER State law requires hunters to immediately field tag every deer taken and then have the carcass examined by the Division of Fish and Wildlife or authorized agent.
The Division checks deer to gather valuable infor mation about the condition and size of the State's herd.
Data are useful in studying deer populations and setting seasons.

HARVEST INFORMATION PROGRAM Â­ H.I.P.
If you are a Delaware mig ratory bird hunter (ducks, geese, doves, woodcock, rails, snipe, and coots); LISTEN UP Â­ You will have to be H.I.P. in 2003.
What is H.I.P.? H.I.P. is the "Harvest Information Program" being implemented by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).
Actually, it was started in 1992 when California, Missouri, and South Dakota participated in the pilot program.
Since then, several states, including Maryland and Dela ware, have been phased into the program.
For many years, the USFWS has collected waterfowl har vest information through an after the season survey of hunters who purchased Federal duck stamps.
This survey was fine for its time, but better information is now needed.
Also, the existing survey has not provided har vest data on other mig ratory birds like do ves and woodcock.
H.I.P. will fulfill these needs.
Under the Harvest Information Program, migratory bird hunters need a special permit to hunt.
To get the permit, hunters have to provide their name and address, and answer a few questions about their previous year's hunting effort and success.
This information is collected by the state, remains totally confidential, and goes immediately to the USFWS who randomly selects hunters to receive a survey form.
This way, hunters have the forms to record har vest information during the season instead of after the fact like the old survey requires.
By sur veying while hunting is going on, much better information should be available to the Service for evaluating bird harvest and the status of migratory bird species.
If you are going to hunt migratory birds in Delaware during the 2003-2004 season, you MUST have a H.I.P. permit.
Call toll free 1-877-335-2447 to obtain your permit number or www.wetland.net.
THIS PERMIT IS FREE.

WATERFOWL HUNTER WATER SURVIVAL TIPS Most drownings could have been prevented.
What causes them? Drownings occur because the victim made the wrong decision, did not realize the dangers of boating in rough, cold water, was not properly prepared, had the wrong equipment, or failed to wear a life-jacket (PFD).
Small boats, by their very nature, are extremely unstable crafts.
Often the victim of a small boat accident did not realize just how unstable his craft was.
Add to this, cold, rough water, and the chances for survival for the sportsman fallen overboard are very slim.
COLD WATER KILLS--even those in excellent condition who know how to swim.
The Five Primary Causes of Water Deaths are: 1 Hypothermia Â­ The rapid loss of body heat in cold water.
2 "Dry" Drowning Â­ Constriction of the throat, and the resulting suffocation, due to a sudden inrush of cold water.
3 "Wet" Drowning Â­ The displacement of air in the lungs by water.
4 Massive Heart Attacks in older, out-of-shape, non-swimmers in cold water.
5 Being run over by own boat, especially when starting in gear, or when relieving oneself.
DROWNING IS THE PRIME CAUSE OF HUNTING DEATHS! Aggressive CPR (rescue breathing and heart massage) can save your life.
What do you and your fishing, hunting, and canoeing friends know about it? MANY PEOPLE--APPARENTLY DEAD FROM DROWNING--MAY NOT BE! Cold water not only kills, but in some instances, it preserves.
Warming drowning victims from the inside out by CPR or warm, moist inhalation may bring them back to life! TAKE A BOATING EDUCATION COURSE 1-800-464-4357 or 739-3486

LANDOWNER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Wildlife is a product of the land.
Game and non-game species alike depend on our farms, forests and wetlands for food, water and cover.
As urbanization spreads and farming practices change, the quantity and quality of wildlife habitat declines.
In recent years, Delaware has seen significant reductions in populations of small game species such as quail, rabbits and squirrels.
This has been a direct result of habitat losses and changes in land-use practices.
Delaware contains 1 1/4 million acres of land and water with 93% of this in non-government ownership.
The private landowner holds the key to the future of wildlife in Delaware.
Practices to improve wildlife habitat can easily be incorporated into an existing agricultural or forest management plan.
In many cases, a change in management on only an acre or two can greatly improve conditions for wildlife, especially small game species.
Habitat enhancement practices such as planting grass nesting cover for quail or maintaining a brushy area for rabbits can be done at little cost.
Habitat improvement expenses will be offset by economic benefits derived from improving soil quality and reducing soil erosion.
The Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife employs a staff of trained biologists who specialize in improving habitat for wildlife.
They are available to meet with landowners and provide recommendations to improve wildlife habitat.
This service is provided free and is open to all landowners.
If you are interested in this program, please call the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife at 739-5297 to schedule an appointment.

GIVE A WILD GIFT The call of the wild is enjoyed by all Dela wareans.
Whether it be a doe bounding across a field, the hoot of an owl in the woods, or a cardinal flashing past a kitchen window, Delaware's wildlife adds a sense of wildness and pleasure to our lives.
The cost of the wild has not always been shared by e veryone.
For many years the Division of Fish and Wildlife has managed game species--those that are hunted, trapped or fished for--with money from license fees and taxes on guns, ammunition and fishing tackle.
In other words, up to this point, sportsmen have paid most of the bill for wildlife management--game, and incidentally, nongame.
Because it is virtually impossible to separate game species from nongame species when it comes to such things as habitat management, nongame species have usually gotten fringe benefits from other wildlife projects.
Today, changing land use and other factors are stressing all wildlife and intensifying the needs to manage our endangered and nongame wildlife.
Now there is an opportunity for all Dela wareans who enjoy the call of the wild to share in the cost of the wild.
By "Giving a Wild Gift" from your state income tax refund, you can help support the protection and management of Delaware's nongame wildlife, endangered species and unique natural areas.
Or, if you do not have a refund coming, you may donate to the program by sending a check directly to: Nongame Wildlife Fund, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, 89 Kings Highway, Dover, DE 19901, Attention: Wildlife Section.
Your "Wild Gift" is tax deductible next year, so everybody wins! Give a Wild Gift...You'll Get One in Return!

THE DELAWARE HUNTER EDUCATION PROGRAM The Delaware Hunter Education Program was established in 1970 and as a result of Section 501, Title 7, Delaware Code .
Therefore all persons born after January 1, 1967 must satisfactorily complete a Basic Hunter Education Course before obtaining a Delaware Hunting license.
The legislative intent was to reduce hunting accidents, and the program has been extremely effective.
Since 1970 over 35,000 Delaware hunters have been certified through the Delaware Hunter Education Prog ram.
While the accident rate has decreased, other factors have become important in the area of the hunter education curriculum.
The number of hunters and the decreasing amounts of open space available to hunt is creating different kinds of situations and con siderations among hunters, landowners and groups or organizations who may or may not be hunters themselves.
In response, the Delaware Hunter Education Prog ram has been changing to meet the demands and challenges of a new hunting era.
An increased emphasis has been placed on safety through improved methods and techniques of the hunter education curriculum.
There have also been a number of additions to the curricu lum including landowner relations, ethical behavior, wildlife identification, wildlife management and conser vation, hunting and wildlife laws and the enforcement of these laws.
The Delaware Hunter Education Prog ram is committed to preserving the heritage of hunting through education.
In addition to Delaware's mandatory Basic Hunter Education, Turkey Education and Trapper Education courses, the program offers numerous advanced courses in Bowhunting, Muzzleloading, Migratory Waterfowl and Deer Hunting and Proper Game Care - From Field to Table.
The Young Waterfowler's Program, Young Ethical Hunter Prog ram and the Becoming An Outdoors-Woman Program target women and youth giving them the opportunity to pursue recreational activities they normally would not participate in.
All of these courses and programs give the hunter/trapper a resource for continued educational opportunities that keep the hunter updated in specific disciplines.
Hunters have a responsibility to themselves, other hunters, the landowner and the wildlife, to continue their education beyond the Basic Hunter Education Course.
For further information about the Delaware Hunter Education Program and scheduled courses, call Dawn Failing at 302-323-5336, or online at www.dnrec.state.de.us/fw COURSES ARE FREE OF CHARGE AND ARE CONDUCTED BY CERTIFIED VOLUNTEER INSTRUCTORS.
HUNTER EDUCATION TRAINING IS OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, SO PLEASE COMPLETE YOUR TRAINING AT LEAST ONE MONTH BEFORE YOUR FIRST HUNT.
CLASS SEATING IS LIMITED AND WILL FILL QUICKLY AS HUNTING SEASON APPROACHES.
YOU MUST PRE-REGISTER TO ATTEND.
CERTIFICATION CARDS WILL BE MAILED WITHIN TEN DAYS AFTER THE COURSE AND MUST BE PRESENTED TO PURCHASE A DELAWARE HUNTING LICENSE.
CERTIFICATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED TO YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TEN.

It also establishes a safety zone of 100 yards within any house or building.
You may not hunt, trap or pursue wildlife in any way within a safety zone, even if you do not discharge a firearm.
It is unlawful to discharge a firearm within 15 yards of any road and it is unlawful to shoot across a road.
Even if you are beyond a safety zone it is illegal to drop shot, slugs or bullets on a house, building, people or domestic animals.
Firearms and bows are capable of sending projectiles great distances under some conditions.
Make sure you are cer tain of your target and where your projectile will land before you shoot.
Be especially careful when shooting up because it allows the maximum range of the gun or bow.
Listed below are examples of the estimated maximum distances for commonly used ammunition in Delaware.
Distances vary with temperature, wind, humidity, and a variety of other factors.
LOAD Number 7 1/2 lead shot Number 4 lead shot Number 4 steel shot Number 2 lead shot Number BB steel OO Buckshot 12 Guage, 1 oz. Slug 22 Caliber Long Rifle Maximum Range in Feet 800 970 780 1050 990 1900 (More than 1/3 mile) 3800 (More than 2/3 mile) One Mile

TRESPASSING IS AGAINST THE LAW Statute 714 of the Delaware Code states that "whoever enters upon the lands or waters of another within this state, without first obtaining permission to do so from the owner or lessee, for the pur pose of hunting, trapping, or fishing, shall be guilty of a class C environmental misdemeanor."
Every hunting season, Delaware Fish and Wildlife Enforcement Agents respond to many calls from landowners complaining about hunters trespassing on their proper ties.
As more land is lost to development, finding places to hunt becomes more difficult and the temptation to trespass increases.
DON'T DO IT! Trespassing is not only illegal, it gives hunters and hunting a bad name.
Always ask permission to hunt.
The future of hunting may depend on it.
A RESOLUTION BY THE DELAWARE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON GAME AND FISH ADOPTING: A HUNTER'S PLEDGE WHEREAS, the Delaware Advisory Council on Game and Fish considers the unlawful taking of fish and wildlife to be a serious issue that the Division of Fish and Wildlife should address through educational programs and enforcement actions; and WHEREAS, The Advisory Council supports the Division of Fish and Wildlife's effor ts to modernize the Wildlife code by increasing the penalties associated with violations of statutes and regulations; and WHEREAS, The Advisory Council encourages hunters and anglers to participate in Operation Game Theft, to police their own ranks to discourage violations and to educate people about the legal taking of Fish and Wildlife; NOW THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED, that the Delaware Advisory Council on Game and Fish endorses the Hunter's Pledge produced by the Isaak Walton League of America and encourages ever y sportsperson in Delaware to honor the provisions of the pledge which states: "A HUNTER'S PLEDGE" Responsible hunting provides unique challenges and rewards.
However, the future of the sport depends on each hunter's behavior and ethics.
Therefore, as a hunter, I pledge to Â· Respect the environment and wildlife Â· Respect property and landowners Â· Show consideration for nonhunters Â· Hunt safely Â· Know and obey the law Â· Support wildlife and habitat conservation Â· Pass on an ethical hunting tradition Â· Strive to improve my outdoor skills and understanding of wildlife Â· Hunt only with ethical hunters By following these principles of conduct each time I go afield, I will give my best to the spor t, the public, the environment and myself.
The responsibility to hunt ethically is mine; the future of hunting depends on me."
This resolution was duly adopted at the October 26, 1993 meeting of the Advisory Council on Game and Fish, Richardson and Robbins Auditorium, Dover, Delaware.

Waterfowl Hunters and Boats Each year more hunters die from drowning and the effects of hypothermia than from gunshot wounds.
Most of the accident reports from waterborne hunting fatalities are not dramatic stories.
The hunter didn't succumb in an "Outdoor Life and Death" struggle.
Rather the accident reports usually read:"Fell out of boat reaching for a decoy and never resurfaced" or capsized boat due to overloading or uneven distribution of decoys, dog, and other hunters.
Many hunters do not regard themselves as a"boater" and as a consequence do not consider the special conditions and challenges of the marine environment.
Personal Flotation Devices (PFD's) are essential and should be worn at all times.
Statistics show that the great majority of capsizing and falls overboard occur with boats less than 20 feet in length.
Special type III (wearable) vests for hunting are a vailable and are comfortable and warm for the coldest, nastiest duck and goose hunting days.
They can be purchased in camo colors.
Hunters use smaller, more easily transportable craft like john boats, bass boats or canoes.
Some boat designs are not as stable as others.
These types, because of their flat bottoms or narrow beams, are more prone to swamping or capsizing.
How can you avoid an unplanned fall into the water? Â· Wear your lifejacket.
Camouflage float coats are available at most marine dealers .
Â· Never cross large bodies of water during rough weather in a boat that can't take the conditions due to size and/or overloading.
Â· Stay with your boat if you capsize and can't get to shore.
Try to climb on it.
Â· Avoid standing up or moving around in the boat as little as possible.
Â· Never move about your boat with a loaded gun or rifle.
Â· Don't overload, read the capacity plate attached to the inside hull as a guide.
Â· Distribute you gear eventually.
Â· Don't drink alcohol , it lowers your body core temperature and encourages one to take chances they wouldn't normally tak e. Every sensible hunter knows that guns, alcohol and drugs don't mix.
Hunting under the influence of alcohol is a Federal hunting violation not excluding loss of state hunting license if convicted.
Those persons born on or after January 1, 1978 must take an approved boating certification course before operating a boat.
Contact the Office of Boating Education for more information on taking a boating education course at 302-739-
DELAWARE'S BIODIVERSITY INITIATIVE Biodiverstiy is the variety of life and its associated processes.
Coined in the late 20th.
Centur y, it is a catch-all term for ever ything living and it is likely to dominate our thinking throughout this Centur y as all Americans strive to maintain things natural, wild and free.
Hunters can take great pr ide in the fact that they have done more than any other group in Nor th America to promote and preserve biodiversity.
Hunter dollars generated through license sales, taxes on spor ting ar ms and ammunition, and direct donations to conser vation have funded wildlife research, sur veys, restoration and enhancement and acquisition of millions of acres of habitat across the Continent.
During the 21st.
Centur y, hunters will continue to lead the wildlife conser vation effor t and by doing so will join a growing number of non-hunters and other environmentalists to achieve common goals and mutual benefits.
Par tnership and cooperation are the keys for success in Delaware's Biodiversity Initiative, which is the foundation for preserving a "Livable Delaware."
