1999 ACO #89 STATE OF MICHIGAN WORKER'S COMPENSATION APPELLATE COMMISSION ROBERT J. EHRESMAN, SR., PLAINTIFF, V CHRYSLER CORPORATION, SELF INSURED, DEFENDANT.
APPEAL FROM MAGISTRATE WIERZBICKI.
ROGER R. KLINE FOR PLAINTIFF, MICHAEL T. REINHOLM FOR DEFENDANT.
OPINION GARN, COMMISSIONER This case comes before the Commission on defendant's appeal from the decision of Magistrate John M. Wierzbicki, mailed February 19, 1997, granting plaintiff an open award of benefits.
This case became ripe for review on September 11, 1997.
On appeal defendant argues the magistrate erred in finding plaintiff suffered a compensable injury when he also found that the disabling condition was also aggravated by significant non-work related injury.
Defendant further argues the magistrate erred by failing to apply the specificity requirement of Miklik v Michigan Special Machine Co, 415 Mich 364 (1982).
Upon review, this Commission is to determine whether the magistrate's findings of fact are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence.
MCL 418.861(13).
The Commission is also to determine whether the magistrate's decision applies the law correctly.
Abbey v Campbell, Wyant 
In the instant case, we remand the magistrate's decision for completion of the record.
Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that plaintiff had worked approximately 25 years for defendant by his last day worked in 1994.
He worked in various capacities for defendant Chrysler at its Warren Truck Plant.
Virtually all of plaintiff's job assignments over the years involved stooping, bending, twisting and walking.
DOCKET #97-0202 Plaintiff has suffered from degenerative arthritis problems for many years.
These problems have been manifested primarily in the knees and the right shoulder.
In 1982 plaintiff underwent arthroscopic surgery on the left knee.
Surgery on the right knee followed in 1986 and he since has had further surgeries including a right knee replacement in November 1994.
It is the opinion of his doctors that his left knee will need to be replaced in the future.
Plaintiff did not identify any specific work-related injury to his knees.
However, central to the primary issue in this case is the fact that plaintiff suffered a nonoccupational injury on November 16, 1990.
On the occasion in question, plaintiff was helping a friend unload a boat when he was struck on the back of his left calf and ankle by a railroad tie they were using in this process.
This incident resulted in an Achilles tendon rupture which required significant treatment including surgeries.
This tendon, in fact, ruptured again in February 1991 necessitating further surgery.
As a consequence, plaintiff missed a year of work.
Plaintiff testified that this boat incident did not involve any injury to his knees.
However, on cross-examination it was established that plaintiff's Social Security Disability Application indicated that this 1990 incident caused the disability.
In fact, the application alleged that this incident severely damaged both knees leading to the need for replacement surgeries
(one of which has been performed already as noted).
Magistrate Wierzbicki, after accurately summarizing the testimony in this matter, found plaintiff suffers from degenerative arthritis in both knees.
He correctly identified this as a condition of the aging process which, in turn, triggers application of the significant manner standard found in MCL 418.301(2).
He stated: Here, there has been no history of trauma to either knee.
The 11/90 injury to the back of Plaintiff's left calf and ankle could have resulted in a change to his body mechanics, a change which could have accelerated his degenerative knee condition.
It must be pointed out, however, that the severe injury to the left calf/ankle in 11/90 was not a work-related injury.
Apparently, Dr. DeClaire was not aware that this injury was not work-related when he opined that said injury caused an exacerbation of Plaintiff's symptoms.
Given the Plaintiff's degenerative knee condition, with the likelihood of possible exacerbation by the nonwork-related injury, we must look to his employment activities in order to determine if he has a work related disability.
*** The Plaintiff's knee condition progressed since 1982, culminating in a total right knee replacement.
The left knee replacement is not far behind.
The 11/90 left calf/ankle injury indirectly affected Plaintiff's knee condition, in that he had to alter his walking and weight distribution, thus further aggravating his knee condition.
He was able, nevertheless, to return to work after he had his 11/90 injury.
He did not seek any specific knee treatment until 10 months afterwards.
I find that the Plaintiff's 2 employment did significantly aggravate his degenerative knee condition, albeit it was even more aggravated by the prior 11/90 calf/ankle injury (not work related).
His knee problems commenced several years before the 11/90 injury, and they were likely to result in a disabling condition even without the 11/90 calf/ankle injury.
The Plaintiff's continual standing, bending and kneeling over his 25 years of employment significantly aggravated his underlying degenerative arthritis condition.
MCL 418.301(2).
His wage earning capacity is severely limited as a result and, thus, he is totally disabled.
MCL 418.301(4).
The fact that Dr. DeClaire was mistaken in believing that the 11/90 injury was work-related does not change the fact that plaintiff is disabled, and that his employment was a significant factor, if not the significant factor.
[Emphasis in original] Dr. Buchman was presented with the correct historical background regarding the 11/90 intervening injury.
He found that the employment was a further significant factor in Plaintiff's disability.
Even though the degenerative arthritic knee condition may have progressed by itself, in any event, it is likely that the Plaintiff's employment significantly sped that process along, requiring a total knee replacement at the early age of 51
.
See Smith v Fletcher Paper Co, 1996 ACO #540, 9 MIWCLR 1554 (1996).
The inevitability that the natural disease or aging process will eventually render a person disabled certainly does not defeat a claim for disability at this time.
We cannot find fault with the magistrate's fact-finding.
We believe that the record supports his conclusions as to the degree of plaintiff's disability and the inevitability of it.
However, the reasoning employed in arriving at a conclusion of compensability is suspect in our opinion.
The magistrate clearly found that plaintiff's 1990 injury was the most significant factor in the aggravation of his degenerative arthritis.
This finding is supported in the record as demonstrated by plaintiff's own statements on his Social Security disability application.
There is also reason to believe that plaintiff's workplace activities could reasonably have been expected to aggravate the arthritis as well and indeed perhaps they did.
We begin our analysis of the magistrate's legal reasoning by noting that MCL 418.301(2) states in pertinent part: [C]onditions of the aging process . . . shall be compensable if contributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner.
As the magistrate recognized, the statute provides for compensability where there is a "significant manner" aggravation.
It does not require that the only significant factor be the workplace aggravation.
Defendant correctly cites Gardner v Van Buren Public Schools, 445 Mich 23, (1994) and Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, 442 Mich 201 (1993) for the proposition that occupational and nonoccupational factors must be weighed against each other in order to determine whether a 3 Ã¯Â¿Â½301(2) "injury" results in a compensable disability.
In the former, the Court said that everyday work activities must be considered against the causal effect of other, nonoccupational factors.
In the latter, the court stated that the significance of workplace events must be judged against all the circumstances to determine whether the resulting mental disability is compensable.
In the magistrate's opinion he simply stated that the occupational aggravation of plaintiff's underlying degenerative arthritis condition was significant and therefore compensable.
We see no evidence that the weighing process of Gardner and Farrington was engaged in.
It is not sufficient to merely label the workplace aggravation as significant.
The salient point of both Gardner and Farrington is that disability is not compensable unless it is significant in comparison to the other factors.
The magistrate found that plaintiff's 1990 non-occupational injury was the most significant aggravator of the underlying condition, but that plaintiff's knee problems predated 1990 and were likely to result in disability regardless of that injury.
We believe this finding is irrelevant in the decision process of this case.
What matters is what did, indeed, happen.
This is why it has long been established in Michigan workers' compensation that if the workplace activities aggravate a preexisting condition, benefits are awarded - even if the disability was considered inevitable if left to its own progression.
Smith v Lawrence Baking Co, 370 Mich 169 (1963).
Although the magistrate noted this in passing, in point of fact, he seems to have applied this rule in reverse.
He stated that plaintiff's preexisting knee problems "were likely to result in a disabling condition even without the 11/90 calf/ankle injury."
This may be true, but it is also true that because of the nature of degenerative arthritis plaintiff's knees were likely to become disabled even without the employment (which is no defense under the law).
It stands to reason, therefore, that if a magistrate may not ignore the effect of a workplace aggravation upon a progressive preexisting condition of the aging process, he may not ignore the effect of an even more significant nonoccupational aggravation upon the same process.
Inevitability is not a defense to either aggravation and the weighing process may not be avoided.
As we stated above, we cannot find fault in the magistrate's findings of fact.
He found that plaintiff suffered from a degenerative arthritis in his knees.
He also found that this condition was aggravated by the workplace activities (no specific event) and a nonoccupational specific event.
He specifically found as fact that the nonoccupational event was the more significant event in the development of disability.
All these findings are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record and we do not disturb them.
However, to support an award of benefits, the magistrate must make factual findings in which he weighs the various factors resulting in disability.
This can only occur by way of a remand as dictated by Layman v Newkirk Electric, 458 Mich 494 (1998).
Upon remand we request a magistrate to determine whether the workplace aggravation is significant in comparison to the nonoccupational aggravation and the underlying condition itself.
We respectfully request the magistrate to also set forth in sufficient detail the basis for his determination whatever it may be.
4 Based upon the above reasoning, we remand this matter for completion of the record.
We retain jurisdiction.
