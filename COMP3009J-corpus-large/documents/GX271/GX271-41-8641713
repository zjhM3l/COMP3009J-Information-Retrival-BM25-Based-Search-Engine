Letter from the Task Force Chair T he Colorado Constructed Treatment Wetlands Inventory project makes a significant contribution to knowledge about the design, construction, operation and energy efficiency of wetlands used to treat wastewater.
Constructed wetlands are a very effective, low-cost, energy conserving wastewater treatment process.
The importance of conserving energy, and the many other benefits of wetlands are outlined in the report.
It has been a pleasure and an enlightening experience working with the many wetlands experts serving on the Constructed Wetlands Task Force.
The Task Force members offered guidance and counsel from many perspectives.
Their input provided the framework for developing and implementing the useful and informative product described by this report.
The Task Force members and their professional affiliations are listed below.
As the facilitator for the Colorado Governor's Office of Energy Management and Conservation (OEMC), I would like to thank these dedicated professionals for sharing their expertise and time to make this project a success.

New Horizons Wastewater treatment professionals have long recognized the cleansing abilities of wetland systems.
However, there are limited data available about these systems.
Pioneers in this industry designed wetland systems based on ingenuity and limited performance data.
Because these professionals had such foresight, there are many operating constructed treatment wetlands and data are now available from which wetland designers can learn.
In 1999, the OEMC recognized the need to collect and disseminate this data and embarked on a Phase I program to evaluate and document constructed treatment wetland features and performance in Colorado.
The OEMC's timely implementation of Phase I will help all future builders of constructed treatment wetlands in Colorado and other parts of the country.
OEMC began this effort by selecting experts from various groups involved with wetlands and wetlands issues.
These individuals comprise the OEMC Wetlands Task Force.
The Task Force provided expertise and advice to guide the project and establish the requirements for evaluating wetland data.
In Search Of Excellence--A New Perspective To implement the program, the OEMC requested proposals from qualified firms to locate, catalog and document the efficiency of Colorado's constructed treatment wetlands.
From that request, the Task Force and OEMC selected the team of HDR Engineering, Inc. and ERO Resources.
The HDR/ERO team was chosen based on their ability to evaluate wetlands from both an engineering and biological perspective.
Including both engineers and biologists in the inventory allowed a comprehensive review of the wetland treatment systems--from engineering details to habitat value.
The team collected data to assess design features, energy savings, flora and fauna biodiversity, general operational problems, and lessons learned.
From this inventory a database that is compatible with the North American Treatment Wetland Database (NADB) was created.
A Vision For The Future The OEMC plans to develop a demonstration project that incorporates the most effective features of all the wetlands evaluated.
The project will require a partnership between the OEMC, an engineering consultant, a community wishing to build a wastewater treatment facility using wetlands, and potentially the Department of Energy, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other interested parties.
Ideally, the wetlands project will incorporate energy savings and efficiency, improved water quality for stream or river discharge, high-value wildlife habitat, and walking trails for wildlife viewing.
The demonstration project will consider general quality-of-life issues such as buffers between developments or communities to address "smart growth" issues and acquisition of open space.
This project will likely begin in the early summer of 2001.

Water--A Limited Resource "When the well's dry, we know the worth of water"--Benjamin Franklin Earth is often referred to as the water planet because more than 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water.
Since this resource is seemingly abundant it is easily taken for granted.
This apparent abundance is deceptive, as only 3% of the earth's water is fresh, and two-thirds of that is trapped in glaciers and icecaps.
So the issue that must be dealt with is not water supply, but water quality.
With a limited amount of fresh water and an increasing global population,wise management of water supplies is essential.
It is important for societies to recognize the value of protecting the quality of this limited and valuable resource.
A Natural Treatment Alternative Natural purification barriers: Wetlands are natural water purification barriers.
Because of land development practices during the last few decades, many natural wetlands have been Wetlands provide a natural cleansing process for Town of Ouray. dewatered.
This reduction in wetland area has resulted in larger amounts of pollutants entering water bodies.
A shift towards wetland area protection has occurred in recent years as the cleansing capabilities of wetlands have been recognized.
Natural cleansing process: The cleansing processes identified in natural wetlands can be mimicked in constructed treatment wetlands.
Constructed treatment wetlands are designed to maximize the natural abilities of wetlands to remove pollutants from a variety of wastewater sources.
This study focuses on the use of constructed wetlands for the treatment of municipal wastewater.
Constructed wetlands are a viable treatment alternative for many reasons.
Treatment wetlands remove solids, oxygen depleting pollutants, and lower bacterial and viral levels.
Unlike traditional treatment methods, wetlands offer many ancillary benefits.
These benefits, including wildlife habitat, and aesthetic and educational values, were evaluated as was the wetland's ability to successfully meet its treatment goals.
Identifying Constructed Treatment Wetlands In Colorado Phase I of the Colorado Constructed Treatment Wetlands Inventory was a reconnaissance effort to locate wetlands in Colorado used to treat point source pollutants.
The project team performed a literature review, pursued leads provided by the OEMC and Task Force, and used local community knowledge to identify appropriate wetland sites.
From a preliminary list of constructed treatment wetlands, the Task Force developed a final list to include in this study.
The criteria used to determine whether a site would be included on the final list are as follows: n Constructed wetland must be treating a point source.
n Data must be available in order to assess the wetland's wastewater treatment efficiency.
Twenty sites met both of the above criteria.
While examples of other types of wetlands are included in the study, most of them were not included in the more rigorous analysis, since this project focused on municipal treatment wetlands.

Evaluating Colorado's Existing Constructed Treatment Wetlands The HDR/ERO team considered both engineering and biological parameters in their wetland evaluations.
The team made site visits to the selected wetlands and used a Site Data Sheet (SDS) to provide a consistent method to evaluate each site.
The evaluation process allowed for an independent review of both the engineering and biological aspects.
The inventory provided a `snapshot' of how the wetland was performing on the date of the site visit.
Water quality records and historical information were gathered during an interview with a wetland contact person; as well as from Colorado Department of Pitkin County subsurface flow wetland in the midst Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) permit files.
of Aspen trees.
Updating The National Database With Information On Colorado Wetlands In the early 1990's the US EPA sponsored the creation of a database containing design and performance information about constructed treatment wetlands.
This information is used to develop design guidelines and to chronicle the successes and failures of wetland systems.
Prior to the Colorado Constructed Treatment Wetland Inventory project, only one Colorado wetland system was included in the database.
A primary goal of this study was to collect data on Colorado's treatment wetlands for entry into the National Database.
The team developed the SDS with this goal in mind and designed a database compatible with the National Database to store this information.
`Lessons Learned' From Those Involved With Existing Wetlands Wastewater treatment using constructed wetlands involves different processes than conventional treatment methods.
Operators, designers, and local officials must approach the implementation and operation of constructed wetlands with an understanding of the natural treatment processes involved.
Information collected from existing Colorado treatment wetlands details the challenges of designing and operating these systems and chronicles the innovative solutions developed to meet them.
The ultimate goal of this project is to disseminate information regarding the use, design, operation, and performance of constructed treatment wetlands.
This will assist future wetland designers and operators to learn from the past experience of others.
Who's Who In Constructed Treatment Wetlands In Colorado Over the course of this project, the HDR/ERO team developed a contact list.
This list is provided in the report to facilitate communication between those with knowledge about these systems and those interested in learning more.
The Colorado Constructed Treatment Wetlands Inventory report documents experiences with Colorado's constructed treatment wetlands.
A description of individual sites is discussed in the report and general observations from the project are presented.
The OEMC, Task Force and HDR/ERO team hope this document will serve as a resource for those interested in using constructed wetlands as an effective and Ridgway State Park uses a treatment wetland as a low energy method of treating wastewater.

What Is A Constructed Treatment Wetland? In a wetland, microorganisms that are naturally present in wastewater are provided with an ideal habitat and readily available organic material as a food source.
As these microorganisms feed, they breakdown pollutants into basic components which are harmless to the environment.
In addition, solids such as trash and silt, are removed as the water moves through the quiescent zones of the wetland.
A constructed treatment wetland is a bio-engineered system that provides optimum conditions for natural cleansing processes to take place.
Constructed treatment wetlands are used to treat widely varying sources of wastewater:
Location of Wetland within Watershed
Wetlands can be constructed to purify water before it enters the receiving water body.
Free Water Surface Wetland
Subsurface Wetland
Two general types of wetlands are typically constructed for water treatment: free water surface flow (FWS) and subsurface flow (SS) wetlands.
In a FWS wetland, water is generally introduced above the ground surface and flows through the wetlands at depths ranging from 6 to 12 inches.
In a SS wetland, water is introduced into a gravel medium through a perforated pipe or other underground dispersal system.
SS wetlands may contain up to 4 feet of gravel, and the water surface elevation is maintained just below the top surface of the gravel.

What Are The Benefits Of Using Constructed Treatment Wetlands?
Silt wetlands contribute to this scenic view of the Rocky Mountains.
By mimicking the natural cleansing processes that take place in wetlands, constructed treatment wetlands can purify wastewater and provide the following ancillary benefits: n Minimize Energy Consumption.
Typically a constructed wetland has no supplemental energy requirements.
The type of pretreatment used will determine the entire energy consumption of the treatment system.
n Minimize Chemical Requirements.
A wetland treatment system uses minimal chemicals.
Before treated wastewater is released it must meet certain regulatory requirements, such as those detailed in the Clean Water Act.
All the wetlands inventoried had the capability of providing some form of disinfection to the treated wastewater; however, many of the wetlands inventoried treated the wastewater to a high enough level that further disinfection was unnecessary.
n Provide Habitat for Wildlife.
Wetland vegetation provides food sources and habitat for birds, mammals, and amphibians.
Over 20% of the animals listed on the Endangered Species List use wetlands for either habitat or as a food source.
Constructed wetlands provide an additional habitat for many species.
n Educate.
Wastewater treatment wetlands offer educational opportunities for local schoolchildren and interested adults.
Treatment wetlands are ideal settings to view wildlife, discuss wastewater treatment processes, and educate the public about the importance of wetlands in the environment.
n Add Aesthetic Value.
Constructed treatment wetlands are an attractive addition to the community.
In contrast to conventional treatment systems, these wetlands provide aesthetic benefits and do not detract from the scenic beauty of many remote areas.
The Colorado inventory identified constructed treatment wetlands that were along trails, used as water features, and as parts of scenic vistas.

Letter from the OEMC Director Wetlands are not only a natural way to clean wastewater--they are energy efficient, help clean the air, provide wildlife habitat, constitute highly valued open space, and are aesthetically preferable to conventional wastewater treatment methods.
The use of wetlands to treat wastewater is a win/win strategy for the environment and the public.
The city officials, design engineers, and operators we encountered in this study are pioneers who have had the courage to try alternative methods in search of more efficient and more economical solutions.
It is our hope that this study will allow engineers, public officials, and operators contemplating the use of wetlands to learn from their successes and stumbling blocks.
In Phase II of this program, the OEMC and the Task Force will put new knowledge to work in a demonstration project that will serve as a model for others and a test for refinements in the treatment of wastewater with wetlands.
I wish to extend my thanks to HDR Engineering, Inc. for the effort and quality they put into this study.
I also wish to thank the task force members, particularly Joe Middlebrooks, whose direction and gravitas have given it its value, and to Jack O'Connor who brought the concept of the value of wetlands as a wastewater treatment system to the attention of this office.
