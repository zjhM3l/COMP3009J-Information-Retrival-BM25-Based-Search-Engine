In response to similar legislation from this year, OA officials also indicated the proposal will require .25 Executive Assistant to initiate general revenue transfers to the appropriate debt service funds, reconcile all paying agent transactions for principal and interest, and monitor all fees due the paying agent.
Total costs for this position including salary, fringe benefits, and equipment 
Paying agent fees are expected to approximate $2,000 annually.
Officials with OA placed one-time costs per issue at approximately $150,000, plus personal services of existing staff Since the proposal does not state the number of years for the debt instruments, Oversight assumes the bonds will have a stated maturity of 20 years to be consistent with Concurrent Resolutions in both the Senate and House of Representatives from this session.
Oversight notes that a 7% rate of interest is likely higher than the current market would require.
Oversight estimates that bonds with a maturity of 20 years would currently require a yield of approximately 5.50%; at this rate, level debt service would approximate $2,930,000 annually.
The required yield could vary depending on the actual market conditions at the time of issuance.
SPORTS COMPLEXES, AUDITORIUMS, and ARENAS: Officials from the Office of Administra tion - Bud get and Plan ning (BAP) state this proposal would provide state funding for various new or existing sports facilities in Missouri.

DESCRIPTION This proposal authorizes funding for several sports and entertainment facilities in Missouri.
The proposal creates the Greater St. Louis Sports Facilities Authority, which is authorized to construct and own a new baseball stadium for lease to the St. Louis Cardinals.
The Authority is also authorized to issue bonds to fund the construction of the new stadium.
The proposal authorizes a maximum state appropriation, starting after FY 2004, of $8 million per year for up to 35 years for the state's portion of funding the stadium project and all related expenses of the stadium and the Authority; the balance of the project funding must come from non- state sources (e.g. city, county, Cardinals).
Prior to the initial issuance of bonds for construction of the new stadium, the proposal requires that the Authority receive local matching funds from non-state sources in an amount equal to one year's sales tax revenues attributable to sales at Busch Stadium.
Additionally, no bonds may be issued by the Authority until the Cardinals owners have signed a commitment to donate the land and $100 million to the stadium project.
Interest on bonds issued by the Authority is exempt from state income tax and bonds issued by the Authority must be publicly, not privately, sold.

The proposal specifies that the Authority owns the naming rights to the publicly-owned stadium and shall negotiate a full fair market value price for the sale or lease of such rights.
Naming rights revenues are to be expended for Authority operating costs, reimbursement to the state (in the event state sales tax revenues produced by the project do not meet or exceed the state's annual appropriations), early retirement of bonds issued by the Authority, and capital improvements to the stadium.
The Cardinals may reasonably reject any name proposed for the stadium.
The proposal requires the Cardinals to manage and supervise the stadium construction project, lease the stadium for at least 40 years, pay annual rent of at least $1.5 million, and pay construction cost overruns.
The proposal prohibits the sale of personal seat licenses and contains requirements on seating availability and restrictions on ticket price increases.
In the event the Cardinals relocate during the lease, they must reimburse the state for all state appropriations made prior to the relocation.
The proposal also authorizes an annual appropriation for the Harry S Truman Sports Complex (home of the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals) of $6.5 million, in addition to amounts previously autho rized .
It aut horiz es an a nnual appro priat ion fo r Savv is Cen ter (S t. Loui s) of $ 3 mil lion .
