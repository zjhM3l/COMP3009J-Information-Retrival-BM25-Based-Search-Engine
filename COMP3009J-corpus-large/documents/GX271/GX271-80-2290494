Y
report of the chair Yes, I am an authentic baby-boomer, a woman who came of age before Roe v. Wade and Title IX.
Like my post-war contemporaries, I grew up with the women's movement.
So when Governor Rowland asked me to serve on the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women in 1996, I accepted, gladly.
I looked forward to the opportunity to contribute to the Commission's work on issues that matter to women.
Many of those issues had been playing out in my life since childhood.
I was born in the 1950s, when Dwight Eisenhower was President and "Leave It to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" defined American gender roles.
Everyone knew where June Cleaver was when she called out to her husband as he returned home from work, "I'm in here, Ward."
Mine was not a "Leave It to Beaver" existence, though.
I grew up with my mother, my grandmother, and one sister in a single parent home.
For us, dividing chores along gender lines was not an option: if a woman didn't do a job, it didn't get done.
I learned to drive a nail, rewire a lamp, and change the washer in a bathroom faucet.
I enjoyed the feelings of competence and confidence that came with the mastery of nontraditional skills.
In school, however, I encountered very real gender-related barriers.
Advanced math and science courses, the critical filters for students seeking careers as engineers, scientists, or physicians, were the de facto province of boys.
Boys could choose from eight varsity sports; there were no varsity teams for girls.
Like the rest of my female classmates, I was required to take Home Economics.
I was the only girl, though, in my Drafting class.
When I joined the Permanent Commission, I knew that PCSW was created by statute in 1973, with a broad mandate to address issues that affect women.
Even so, I was astounded at the range of its activities.
In its "study of all matters concerning women," for example, it collects and analyzes data that are crucial to informed public policy decisions, and disseminates these "Facts about Connecticut Women" to leaders in government, business, and education, and to the media.
Its Congressional District Advisory Councils bring local leaders together to discuss their concerns.
Its Connecticut
Women's Voices 2000 survey identified the issues most important to Connecticut women in this past election year.
PCSW is obligated to "inform leaders of business, education, state and local governments, and the communications media of the nature and scope of the problem of sex discrimination, with a view toward enlisting their support in working toward improvement."
To this end, PCSW provides sexual harassment awareness and prevention training to state employees, and transmits complaints of gender-related workplace discrimination to the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities.
It also consults with the General Assembly on statutory drafting and provides legislative testimony within the sphere of its expertise.
(I'm happy to report that the Agency's 2000-2001 budget appropriately recognizes the value of these services to our lawmakers by restoring funding for a legislative analyst's position frozen out of the budget in 1990).
Likewise per its charter, PCSW works to build coalitions of public and private agencies working on women's issues, such as the Connecticut Women's Agenda and the Connecticut Women's Health Campaign.
Through the CWHC, the Commission works not only to ensure women's access to family planning and safe, legal abortion, but also on a multitude of other health care issues affecting women of all ages.
For example, it spearheaded efforts to enact legislation requiring insurers to pay for minimum hospital stays for childbirth and mastectomy, helped secure a $1.8 million budgetary appropriation for breast and cervical cancer screening for uninsured women, helped secure passage of a bill requiring insurers to pay for prescription contraceptives, and co-sponsored a program to alert women to risks associated with osteoporosis.
PCSW has developed a number of programs to serve women across the economic spectrum.
Its Women's Economic Development Initiative, for example, won the Small Business Administration 2000 award for its programs for women business owners.
Its Nontraditional Employment for Women Program helps women train for high-wage jobs in the skilled trades.
Its staff members contribute to several committees and task forces that bring public and private partners to the table to assess and address the causes of poverty and develop strategies for education and job training.
two
PCSW also works for broader representation of women in elected and appointed office through its Talent Bank, and mentors future Connecticut leaders by organizing "Girls in Government" and "Take Our Daughters to Work" programs at the Capitol.
It supports legislation to reduce sexual assault and domestic violence.
It participates in a working group on prison issues to ensure that the needs of incarcerated women and the concerns of family members of both female and male inmates are not overlooked in discussions of prison reform.
PCSW is non-partisan; it offers information and counsel on women's issues to legislators on both sides of the aisle.
It is also issuedriven, and because its issue positions often challenge long-held assumptions about gender roles, it sometimes, as Sojourner Truth would say, "stirs the waters."
If the Commission weren't making at least a few waves in the process, it wouldn't be doing its job.
PCSW is fortunate, though, to have many colleagues who understand that policies that expand women's educational and career options expand men's options, too, much as policies that give women the skills necessary for self-sufficiency, safeguard them from violence in their homes, ensure that they receive court-ordered child support, and guarantee them access to appropriate health care, strengthen families and communities in the process.
Ours is a classic win-win agenda.
Our work, though, is far from done.
Reports that Connecticut women still earn only 72 cents for every dollar their male counterparts earn dismay us.
Thank goodness PCSW is a permanent commission; we still have much to accomplish.

executive director message phone survey of women and men conducted by a bi-partisan and multicultural team of pollsters.
The purpose was to determine the priorities and concerns that Connecticut women have Â­ particularly with respect to the economy and their families.
One disturbing finding was that more than half of all the women surveyed felt that the economic "boom" of the late `90's had not reached them or their families.
Women were clear, however, about one of the solutions to their economic worries: Most women list equal pay and benefits as their top priority.
W
We began this "millennial" year at the PCSW by looking backward at women's progress over the last quarter century, and we ended the year by looking forward to the challenges in the year ahead.
In the winter, as part of our 6th Annual Making Women Visible Day event on February 23, 2000, we published an edition of our annual facts book, Connecticut Women in the New Millennium: Not Equal Yet.
We provided current data about the status of women in the economy and the workplace, in the family, in government, in the criminal justice system and with respect to health and health care.
But we also took a look backward to the period in the mid 1970's when the PCSW was established to see how much progress we had made in the past twenty-five years.
To enrich our thinking, we invited seven Connecticut scholars to contribute brief essays and to join us for a panel discussion about where we have been and where we are heading.
We are very grateful to Ivor Echols of the UConn School of Social Work, Shyamala Raman of St. Joseph's College, Susan Porter Benson of the University of Connecticut/Storrs, Maria-Luz Samper of the University of Connecticut/Storrs, Carolyn Mazure of Yale University School of Medicine, Diana Evans of Trinity College and Andi Rierden of Fairfield University for their thoughtful contributions.
(Later in the year, Professor Echols passed away.
We mourn the loss of this wonderful colleague and advocate.)
At the PCSW, we ar e listening to women's voices as we always do.
We continue our work for equal pay and benefits, better access to health care, the growth of women owned businesses, reduction of poverty among women and their children, and equal treatment under the law.
We also continue to advocate for more assistance for low wage workers, programs to help women enter higher wage nontraditional occupations, better services for women in the criminal justice and mental health systems, and family friendly policies in the workplace.
To help us achieve our goals, we work with a broad range of partners including the members of our Congressional District Advisory Councils, the Connecticut Women's Agenda, the Connecticut Women's Health Campaign, the Women's Economic Development Initiative, the Working Group on Prison Issues, the Nontraditional Occupations Advisory Committee, and many others.
Working for equality is a long, collaborative process and we extend our thanks to all our colleagues.
At the PCSW we know exactly why we are doing this work because in the year 2000 we were blessed with the births of three new baby girls in our staff "extended family!" We all learned again, in very personal ways, about the importance of high quality, affordable health care and workplace policies that support parents and families.
For Sophia, Amelia and Anai, Â­ our three newest women of the future Â­ and for all our daughters and sons, granddaughters and grandsons, we are proud to work for a more equitable future and to report our activities in this Annual Report.
In the fall, we released the results of our statewide poll, Connecticut Women's Voices 2000 that provided information to help us look forward.

report of the year 2000 connecticut women's agenda
included seven brief essays from scholars mentioned above with expertise in women's issues.
On Tuesday, May 9th, we hosted our third annual Making Women Visible Dinner at the Legislative Office Building during which we reviewed the successes and disappointments of the 2000 legislative session, and distributed a written summary of legislation affecting the status of women.
Several participants in the Connecticut Women's Agenda agreed to meet with us in the summer and fall to strategize about ways to increase the value of the CWA to those who participate, and to generate interest among additional organizations.
As a result of these discussions, we initiated two new activities: We held two longer meetings in October at which we featured presentations from organizations that offer direct services to women, one in the Governor 's Southwestern Connecticut Office in Bridgeport and the other at the Capitol in Hartford.
We also offered a "skills building" workshop in November about how to conduct successful press events and communicate an effective message.
T
The Connecticut Women's Agenda is an open forum for representatives of organizations to share information about issues affecting the status of women and their families in Connecticut.
Hosted by the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women on a monthly basis, these meetings have included discussions of health care and welfare policies, violence against women, employment discrimination, economic development, criminal justice and family law.
On February 23, 2000, the Connecticut Women's Agenda, the Connecticut Junior Leagues, and the PCSW held the sixth annual Making Women Visible Day at the Capitol.
In honor of the "millennial year," the day included a morning press conference, followed by a special luncheon and a panel of scholars discussing the progress that women have made and the challenges that we still face.
Speakers at the morning press conference who introduced their legislative priorities included: Jane McNichol of the Legal Assistance Resource Center of Connecticut; Laura Micklus, Connecticut Women and Disabilities Network; Nancy Pilver, Connecticut Breast Cancer Coalition; Fernando Betancourt, Latino and Puerto Rican Affairs Commission; Anne Stanback, Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund; and Carolyn Gabel, DemocracyWorks.
Also speaking on behalf of the PCSW were Chairperson Barbara DeBaptiste, Executive Director Leslie Brett, and Public Information Officer Barbara Potopowitz.
The afternoon panel included Professor Ivor Echols of the UConn School of Social Work, Professor Shyamala Raman of St. Joseph's College, Professor Maria-Luz Samper of the University of Connecticut/Storrs, Professor Carolyn Mazure of Yale University School of Medicine, and Professor Diana Evans of Trinity.
As part of our presentation on Making Women Visible Day, we released two publications: The Connecticut Women's Agenda 2000 Legislative Priorities, which included information from thirty organizations, and our annual book of facts entitled, Connecticut Women in the New Millennium - Not Equal Yet.

connecticut women's health campaign
T
The Connecticut Women's Health Campaign (CWHC) is a statewide coalition of organizations representing consumers, providers and policy experts with particular interests in women's health and access to health care.
The Campaign is convened and Co-Chaired by the PCSW ; the other Co-Chair in 2000 was CONNSACS (Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services).
This is one way that the PCSW "serves as a liaison between government and private interest groups concerned with services for women."
In 2000, we continued to focus on legislative proposals to improve the health of women and their families.
Our priorities during the year included the expansion of Medicaid coverage for adults, women and cardiovascular disease, multicultural health, and funding for treatment of uninsured women with breast and cervical
five
cancer.
Members of the Connecticut Women's Health Campaign delivered testimony and provided information to the General Assembly on these and other women's health issues.
Among the legislative successes for women's health in 2000 was the expansion of HUSKY A coverage to adults with incomes up to 150% of poverty, effective January 1, 2001.
Also, legislation was passed that allowed working people with disabilities to continue to receive health care coverage through Medicaid.
Another statute was enacted to authorize the Department of Social Services to seek federal funds if they become available for the treatment of uninsured women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer, and also directs the Department of Public Health to establish an account into which the proceeds of any settlement of a private lawsuit may be deposited and used for such treatment.
The Connecticut General Assembly also established an Advisory Commission on Multicultural Health within the Department of Public Health to work toward the elimination of disparities in health status among the state's cultural and ethnic communities.
The Chairperson of the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women has a seat on this commission.
On March 15, 2000, we held our fourth annual Women's Health Day at the Capitol with a public forum highlighting racial disparities in health care.
Panelists included Margarita Burgos of the Office of Multicultural Health, Ellen Andrews of the CT Health Policy Project, Suzette Benn of the Urban League of Greater Hartford, and Alma Cain of the Connecticut Dieticians Association.
Display tables in the concourse of the Legislative Office Building offered valuable information about women's health and members of the Connecticut Women's Health Campaign were available to answer questions.
In addition, we published a "Women's Health Quiz" with fact sheets to educate the public about various women's health issues.
women's economic development initiative
I
In March, the Women's Economic Development Initiative (WEDI) sponsored the second annual Connecticut Women Entrepreneurs' Day at the State Capitol.
PCSW Commissioner Barbara DeBaptiste directed the opening ceremonies.
The day's event was taped on Connecticut Public Access Television (CTN) and was then broadcast on statewide public access.
Over 200 women attended the event to network and gather information on financing, training programs and state procurement opportunities.
The technical fair provided an opportunity to interact with representatives of state purchasing offices.
In addition to Entrepreneurs' Day activities, PCSW Public Information Officer and the WEDI Project Coordinator Barbara Potopowitz continued to sit on committees at the CT Department of Public Works and the CT Department of Transportation that helped to establish the internal procedures regarding their set-aside and disadvantaged business enterprise procurement programs.
In the year 2000, the Starting and Growing A Business subcommittee of WEDI worked with the State Library Association to produce a video entitled, Starting and Growing A Small Business Â­ Choices for Success.
This video highlights the many resources in the state, both public and private, that assist in the start-up of small businesses.
Many women who own small businesses were also featured to talk about the opportunities and obstacles they faced as they began their businesses.
Jim Kading of Stonington donated production of this video and worked with the PCSW as part of an intern project through Southern Illinois University.
Nancy Aborn-Patton of Patton Enterprises and a local television personality donated her talent and narrated the video.
Copies of this video will be housed in every library in the state of Connecticut for circulation.

A new subcommittee of WEDI was formed in 2000 to look at the issue of state certification for small businesses.
Through the work of this committee, the state Department of Transportation (CONNDOT) and the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) now have a reciprocal agreement: when a small business receives certification from CONNDOT, it is automatically offered certification in the DAS program without completing any additional paperwork.
DAS is the state agency that purchases all the goods and services for the state of Connecticut.

H.B. 5158, AN ACT CONCERNING ELIGIBILIT Y FOR UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION Result: Failed This proposed bill would have allowed the state to use an "alternative base period" for calculating when workers would be eligible to receive unemployment benefits.
The purpose was to eliminate or reduce the waiting period for collecting benefits for people who had only recently entered the workforce, such as those in transition from welfare to work or who were seasonal employees.
Although the Labor Committee and the Appropriations Committee voted upon the bill favorably, it failed in the Planning and Development Committee.

PA 00-199, AN ACT TRANSFERRING ENFORCEMENT OF THE SET-ASIDE PROGRAM FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNIT Y DEVELOPMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES (S.B. 392) Result: Passed - This bill took effect upon passage.
This bill completes the transfer of the state set-aside program for women and minority owned businesses from the Department of Community and Economic Development (DECD) to the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) and the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO).
In the 1999 legislative session, the certification process was transferred from DECD to DAS.
This bill now gives the process of setting goals and exceptions for state agencies to DAS and the monitoring and enforcement to CHRO.
S.H.B. 5855, AN ACT CONCERNING UNEXPECTED TANF FUNDS Result: Original bill failed, but some elements were passed in Public Act 00-2, An Act Concerning Programs And Modifications Necessar y To Implement The Budget Relative To The Depar tment Of Social Services (H.B. 6002) Effective July 1, 2000 The intent of the original bill was to increase reporting about the state's expenditures of federal funds claimed under the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant, and to use unspent or available funds for a Reserve Fund.
The original bill was voted favorably upon by the Human Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee, but then failed in the Committee on Legislative Management.
Language regarding reporting by the Department of Social Services to the General Assembly was added to section 34 of the DSS budget implementation bill (H.B. 6002).
Per this section, DSS must transmit the TANF expenditure report to the General Assembly within 45 days of its submission to the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
WELFARE, EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING H.B. 5322, AN ACT CONCERNING ACCESS TO PO ST-SECONDARY EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING Result: Original bill failed, but some elements were added as an amendment to section 7 of Public Act 00-204, An Act Concerning Changes To Miscellaneous Education And Higher Education Statues (S.B. 160) - Effective upon passage The final version of this bill requires the Labor Department, in cooperation with the Department of Social Services, to design a program of state funded work study slots combined with education and job training at institutions of higher education, such as community colleges and other job training programs.
Participants in work study slots would also be able to obtain child care and transportation assistance while at work and in school, provided they were eligible.
Some slots must be reserved for education and training in nontraditional occupations.
Eligible participants will include people currently receiving Temporary Family Assistance and other "needy persons" as defined by the state TANF plan, with priority given to people at or below the poverty level.
The Department of Labor must report to the legislature on the design of this program by January 1, 2001.
WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE EXPANSION OF HUSKY A COVERAGE TO PARENTS.
H.B. 5928, AN ACT CONCERNING THE EXPENDITURES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES (SECTION 18) Result: Eligible population reduced, but some adult coverage retained.

6002, AN ACT CONCERNING THE EXPENDITURES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Result: Passed as Public Act 00-2, An Act Concerning Programs And Modifications Necessar y To Implement The Budget Relative To The De par t ment Of Social Ser vices (H.B. 6002) - Effective July 1, 2000 The budget enacted last year included a scheduled expansion of HUSKY A (Medicaid) health care coverage for adults with incomes up to 185% of poverty.
The Governor 's budget proposed a repeal of this expansion.
The final budget passed for FY 2000/2001 lowers the eligibility threshold to 150% of poverty, and postpones the implementation of the expanded coverage until January 1, 2001.
The budget includes $7.4 million for this program.
(These changes do not affect eligibility for children.)

PA 00-213, AN ACT PROVIDING WORK INCENTIVES FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES (H.B. 5778) Result: Passed - Effective October 1, 2000 The new law requires the state to take advantage of recent changes in Medicaid rules so that working people with disabilities can continue to receive health care coverage through Medicaid.
Instead of losing health care coverage as earnings increase, working people with disabilities will be able to continue to receive coverage through Medicaid.
Those with earnings exceeding 200% of poverty must contribute a premium co-pay based on a sliding scale formula which takes into account significant medical expenses.

(Section 4)
S.B. 532, AN ACT EXTENDING BENEFITS UNDER THE HUSKY PLAN TO CERTAIN UNEMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS Result: Failed This bill would have allowed people with incomes up to 300% of poverty level who had lost their health insurance because of loss of employment and had also exhausted their COBRA coverage to receive coverage under the state sponsored HUSKY B program.
Although the bill was voted upon favorably in the Human Services, Appropriations and Public Health Committees, it was never taken up for a vote in the Senate.
H.B. 5652, AN ACT CONCERNING A CERTIFICATE OF NEED EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN PHYSICIAN OFFICES AND THE ACCREDITATION OF OFFICES WHERE CERTAIN LEVELS OF ANESTHESIA ARE ADMINISTERED Result: Failed This proposed bill included a section opposed by the PCSW and the Connecticut Women's Health Campaign because it would have allowed "physician owned or physician controlled" health care providers to be exempt from the Certificate of Need (CON) review process.
The CON process has provided the regulatory review that prevents health care providers from reducing access to essential services, including reproductive health care services.
Although the bill was voted favorably upon in the Public Health Committee, it failed in the Appropriations Committee.
S.B. 423, AN ACT ESTABLISHING AN ADVISORY COMMISSION ON MULTICULTURAL HEALTH Result: Amended modified version passed in another bill, PA 00-01, AN ACT IMPLEMENTING AND MAKING TECHNICAL REVISIONS TO THE STATE BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM ENDING June 30, 2001 (H.B. 6001) Section 14 creates a new Advisory Commission on Multicultural Health to assist and oversee the efforts of the Office of Multicultural Health, within the Department of Public Health, to eliminate disparities in health status among the state's cultural and ethnic communities.

nine
In spite of passage the previous year of the law requiring equitable coverage of prescription contraception, some women are still denied coverage of the specific medication prescribed by their physicians.
In partial response to that problem and denials of other prescriptions, section 7 of H.B. 5911 requires that managed care organizations must develop their "formularies" or lists of covered drugs in the same way they develop "medical protocols," which require input from physicians who are specialists in various fields.

PA 00-80, AN ACT CONCERNING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR PROSECUTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND FOR REQUESTING A NEW TRIAL (S.H.B. 5903) Result: Passed - Effective upon passage This act increases, in many cases, the time period in which a person identified by DNA analysis may be charged with sexual assault, providing the victim has notified the police or a prosecutor of the offense within five years of the assault.
This act applies to first-degree sexual assault, aggravated first-degree sexual assault, sexual assault in a spousal or cohabitating relationship, second-degree sexual assault, and third-degree sexual assault, with and/or without a firearm.

S.H.B. 5701, AN ACT CONCERNING THE FORFEITURE OF ELECTORAL RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES Result: Failed This proposed bill would have restored voting rights to persons convicted of a felony as soon as such persons were released from prison and/or completed their parole.
Connecticut currently denies voting rights to people convicted of felonies until they have completed their entire sentence including probation.
The purpose of this proposal was to encourage greater re-integration and political participation.

The purpose of this new law is to prevent circumstances in which new parents may leave a baby in unsafe or even fatal circumstances because they are afraid of the consequences of abandoning the baby.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE PA 00-200, AN ACT CONCERNING VICTIM'S RIGHTS (S.H.B. 5785) Result: Passed - Effective October 1, 2000 This bill covers several issues relevant to the rights of victims.

talent bank
P
PCSW maintains a Talent Bank in compliance with our statutory mandate to "promote consideration of qualified women for all levels of government positions."
The purpose of the Talent Bank is to address the under-representation of women on state boards, councils and commissions.
In the year 2000, the Talent Bank had a total listing of 247 qualified women with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise.
This list is made available to the Governor, President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Speaker of the House, and any other governmental appointing authority for its consideration in making appointments.
This list is also made available to the heads of state boards and commissions.
Additionally, Talent Bank members receive a list of the current vacancies each month by email or fax.
In November 2000, PCSW conducted another seminar in its series entitled "How to Be Appointed to State Boards and Commissions."
It was held at Connecticut College in New London and moderated by PCSW Commissioner and Chair of the Public Information / Talent Bank Committee, Ann Clark.
The purpose of these seminars is to educate women about the steps needed to determine where there are vacancies and how to apply for a vacancy.
Michele Stebbins, the Governor 's appointment representative, discussed the process involved in getting appointed and brought with her the vacancy list and application forms to complete for gubernatorial appointments.
Patricia Hendel, PCSW Commissioner and President of the National Association of Commission for Women (NACW), shared her own experiences about serving on state boards.
In addition, she talked about the process of seeking appointment to federal positions.
Brenda Williams discussed her experience as a member of the PCSW Congressional District Advisory Council.
Over 50 women attended this seminar to learn mor e about participating in Connecticut's state boards and commissions.
Another goal of the PCSW Talent Bank is to create a pool of candidates to increase the representation of women on the bench.
In 2000, PCSW Commissioners formalized the procedure to be used when women come before the Commission asking for endorsement in their quest for a judgeship.
PCSW also participates in the Reflecting Connecticut project with DemocracyWorks, a
community based organization.
Reflecting Connecticut is a coalition of approximately 15 organizations that support the appointment of women and people of color to state boards and commissions.

special projects
T
The special projects that were implemented during 2000 support the priorities and initiatives of the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women in a variety of important ways.
Very often these are the programs we take into the communities in an effort to reach out to people all across Connecticut.
Because of projects such as the Advisory Councils, the girls and government programs, and the public issues forums, more people than ever before are informed about their rights and aware of the opportunities to become involved.
Connecticut Women's Voices 2000 PCSW was pleased to partner with the Center for Policy Alternatives on Women's Voices 2000, a polling project which surveyed women and men in Connecticut and across the nation about the issues they felt were important during the election year.
In Connecticut, the bi-partisan national pollsters conducted two focus groups, one with entrepreneurial women and another with low-income women, many of whom are transitioning from welfare to work.
Additionally, they conducted telephone polling with 400 women and 200 men in Connecticut.
Lifetime TV, a partner in this project, devoted a significant amount of air time to the issues of concern to women.
The Center for Policy Alternatives conducted press conferences at both the Republican and Democratic Conventions with good results, including media coverage.
At a press conference on October 24 in Hartford, Linda Tarr-Whelan, president of the Center for Policy Alternatives, released the data from the national W o men's Voices 2000 polling project.
The Permanent Commission on the Status of Women highlighted the Connecticut-specific data gleaned from the polling data.
The Center for Policy Alternatives has been tracking women's views in every presidential election since 1992 through its Women's Voices surveys.
Key findings from the Connecticut survey include:
s Women expressed their belief that their families have not shared in the current economic prosperity.
Many are asking, "What if this is this as good as it gets?" s Women most want economic security throughout their life cycles, and safer communities.
An overwhelming majority of women in Connecticut strongly support the following policies: Equal pay and benefits, job-independent, affordable health care, retirement benefits that are portable from job to job, and stronger gun safety laws.
s Women are concerned both about economic security and about the well being of our children and communities.
s Elected officials are not getting a complete picture of economic conditions in our state partly because those who have been left out of the economic prosperity are the least likely to vote.
s Connecticut women and men overwhelmingly agree that state government should do more to help uninsured individuals get affordable health coverage.
s A majority of Connecticut women and men also agree that more should be done to expand the availability of good, affordable child care, although more women feel this way than do men.
s Women and men support several approaches to helping small businesses get started and grow, with some looking to financial institutions to increase loans and credit to small business, and others looking to government to provide low interest loans and increase access to contracts to women and minorities.
s Women in Connecticut feel the "time crunch" more than women in other parts of the country.
A majority of Connecticut women report that juggling work and family demands has gotten harder, not easier, over the last four years.
s Women and men agree that women get paid less, on average, than men get paid for the same work.
s Women want shorter and more flexible hours and a job that pays more.
The charts that follow illustrate the findings from the survey of Connecticut women and men.
(A complete copy of the report is available from PCSW upon request, and is posted on our website.)

Women most want economic security throughout their life cycles, and safer communities.
The policy agenda is diffuse, and women and men have different priorities for improving peoples' lives.
Women place equal pay and benefits, followed by job independent, affordable health care are retirement benefits that move from job to job at the top of their lists.
Men look first to retirement benefits, followed by equal pay and benefits and lower taxes to increase income.

Women top their lists with education, followed by retirement and Social Security and health care.
Men have more economic concerns listing education, followed by taxes and the economy and jobs as their top concerns.
Men are more than twice as likely as women to list taxes as a concern.

Connecticut women and men overwhelmingly agree that state government should do more to help uninsured individuals get affordable health coverage.
Nonetheless, Connecticut men and women overwhelmingly believe the state government should do more to help uninsured individuals get affordable coverage--with more than eight out of ten women and seven out of ten men advocating state intervention.
Moreover, women of color are even more likely than their white counterparts to believe the state should help.

Women and men agree that women get paid less, on average, than men get paid for the same work.
Equal pay for equal work is a driving concern, and both men and women agree women are not paid the same as men.
However, women are significantly more likely than their male counterparts to say women get paid less than men for the same work.
Connecticut women are more likely than women nationwide to think women are paid less than men, whereas men are equal in their response.

The Advisory Councils meet in the spring and fall in each of the six Congressional Districts.
During 2000, a total of 240 persons attended the meetings that focused on a variety of women's issues such as health care and pay equity.
The CDACs were established in 1996 as a way for PCSW to become more aware of issues that are of particular concern to women across Connecticut.
Members come from all backgrounds and occupations and are committed to using their leadership skills to achieve equity for women.

Health Care Research As part of a project sponsored by the PCSW, Yale graduate students, in the Schools of Epidemiology and Public Health, conducted focus groups with women who were uninsured to learn how they manage their personal health care needs in the absence of health insurance coverage.
The women they studied worked on average 31 hours per week and earned between $20,000 - $29,000 per year.
The women reported that they would postpone seeking medical care until they judged that their conditions absolutely warranted professional attention.
For those with conditions needing prescription medications, they often did without or reduced the dosage to

This information is particularly applicable to the work of PCSW to improve public policy and provide public information on women's issues.
day by talking with the girls to increase their awareness of women's rights and public policy.
This program empowers girls to become leaders, become involved in their communities, and to continually improve the status of women.
Take Our Daughters To Work Day Chair Barbara DeBaptiste welcomed about 100 persons Â­ girls, boys, and adults Â­ to the program that highlighted nontraditional occupations in state government.
A state police detective, a conservation enforcement officer, a computer educator, and two carpenters shared information about their careers.
We were pleased that Secr etary of the State Susan Bysiewicz, Treasur er Denise Nappier, and Comptroller Nancy Wyman took time to address the group.
Girls and Technology In collaboration with the Girls and Technology Network, the "Girls and Tech Expo," a daylong event for 7th grade girls, was held at the UCONN School of Engineering on September 14.
This "hands-on activity" was designed to make the girls think about careers in technology.
Lt. Governor M. Jodi Rell addressed the girls and encouraged them to pursue their educations.
Women Fostering Girls' Leadership Through Literature PCSW co-sponsors this day each year with the American Association of University Women in the New London and Old Saybrook area.
This daylong event brings together 120 5th grade girls, representing the diversity of their schools, from urban, suburban, and rural communities, to learn and practice leadership skills.
The women leading the day foster leadership in these girls with the expectation that they will foster leadership in younger girls when they return to their schools.
4-H Citizenship Day 4-H Citizenship Day at the Capitol, held this year on April 24, encouraged and supported young people to become involved with their government.
The day included a presentation on legislative action, role-playing a mock hearing, and a tour of the Capitol.
This year they used voting machines to vote in the presidential election and on a referendum question.
The day concluded with a new understanding of governmental procedures and systems.
Youth Democracy The Permanent Commission on the Status of Women cooperated with Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz in hosting a Youth State of Democracy Conference on October 3 at the University of Hartford in an effort to increase
80th Anniversary of Women's Suffrage The Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, along with the Secretary of the State and several other women's organizations, organized a celebration at the State Capitol of the 80th anniversary of women's suffrage on September 14.
We were inspired by special appearances by women who actually voted 80 years ago.
We chose to celebrate this anniversary on September 14th because it was on that date in 1920 that the Connecticut General Assembly went into Special Session to vote on the ratification of the 19th Amendment.
Equality Day is generally celebrated on August 26th, which is the day in 1920 that President Wilson signed the Amendment guaranteeing women the legal right to vote.
National Association of Commissions for Women (NACW) Convention The National Association of Commissions for Women is a nonpartisan membership organization composed of regional, state, county and local commissions created by government to improve the status of women.
Connecticut commissioner Patricia T. Hendel presided over a convention with a record attendance of nearly 350 and was re-elected without opposition to a third one-year term as president.
Barbara DeBaptiste was elected to a two-year term on the NACW Board of Directors, and Sarah McGirr was named Co-chair of the Website Committee.
Programs With and For Girls The programs outlined here link young people with government and adults in leadership roles.
With youth involved in government, our democracy becomes stronger.
These participants are the future of Connecticut, and their exposure to public policy issues ensures a productive and enthusiastic contribution to the state.
Girls Involved in Government Two hundred Girl Scouts and their leaders met at the Capitol on March 22 and learned many important lessons about becoming involved in government.
Many of our state's leaders provided inspiration and information to the Girl Scouts from the five Girl Scout Councils in Connecticut.
The Permanent Commission on the Status of Women actively participated in this

nontraditional employment for women The Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) Program, funded by the CT Department of Labor, has developed a training program that incorporates "best practices" in preparing women to enter state registered apprenticeships and other nontraditional occupations.
In addition, the program provides technical assistance to implement initiatives that make it easier for women to work in nontraditional occupations.
This program is designed to meet the common goals of the PCSW and the CT DOL: To place women in nontraditional employment that will allow women to earn higher wages and support themselves and their families, to ensure equal access for women to the employment opportunities in the building trades, and to increase the percentage of female participation in the state's registered apprenticeship program.
T
nity colleges, job training programs, and at job fairs.
Employers often call us for referrals when seeking to hire women in the trades and nontraditional occupations.
We work closely with the US Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program to assist employers who report having difficulty recruiting women for their construction projects.
The NEW Program Manager participates in the meetings of the Joint Apprenticeship Training Directors Committee of Connecticut and the Connecticut Apprenticeship Council.
In addition, the PCSW Special Projects Director sits on the Steering Committee of the Hartford Construction Jobs Initiative to assure that women are recruited for careers in the major construction projects underway in Hartford.
The second Pr o spective Appr enticeship Training Program accepted 25 women into the 10week training program that began in February 2000 at E. C. Goodwin Vocational-Technical School in New Britain.
We are happy to report that of the 20 women who graduated from the training program, 13 entered apprenticeships and three were employed in other nontraditional jobs.
Attentive and on-going case management is the reason for an 80% placement rate and a one year retention rate of 75%.
The curriculum includes math, shop classes in electrical and plumbing, physical fitness, safety, and blueprint reading.
There is an additional focus on employability skills such as sexual harassment awareness and prevention, employer expectations and work ethic, as well as problem solving and conflict resolution.
A second major component of the NEW Program is the technical assistance the PCSW provides to employers, unions, program operators, and the Regional Workforce Investment Boards to strengthen partnerships that promote and increase employment and training opportunities for women throughout Connecticut.
In addition, we talk to hundreds of students in high schools, vocational-technical schools, commu-
Annual Women in the Trades and Nontraditional Occupations Conference The third major component of the NEW Program is the annual Women in the Trades and Nontraditional Occupations Conference held in the spring each year.
Approximately 300 persons attended the 11th annual conference held on April 8, 2000, at the Ramada Plaza Hotel in Meriden.
In her keynote address Acting Hartford Police Chief Deborah Barrows emphasized the importance of being true to your values and principles.
She expressed her belief that this was especially important for women who work in occupations that are the traditional domain of men.
The Career Fair at the conference provided many opportunities Â­ apprenticeship, operators, employers in the fields of technology and protective services, and government agencies all participated with information tables.
Women find this conference an excellent opportunity for networking and education.
The annual conference is funded by donations from government agencies, businesses, unions and interested persons.

public information

Section 46-4a of the Connecticut General Statutes requires the Commission to "inform leaders of business, education, state and local government and the communications media of the nature and scope of sex discrimination with a view toward enlisting their support in working toward improvement."
At the 6th Annual Making Women Visible press conference, held jointly with the Connecticut Women's Agenda on February 23, 2000, we released the special 2000 edition of Facts About the Status of Women in Connecticut entitled, Connecticut Women in the New Millennium: NOT EQUAL YET! This edition highlighted brief essays contributed by scholars from colleges and universities across the state that reflect the changes and challenges that women have faced in this century, and continue to face today.
The contributors were: Susan Porter Benson, University of Connecticut (The Wage Gap); Ivor J. Echols, d. 2001, Professor Emerita, University of Connecticut School of Social Work (Poverty); Diana Evans, Ph.D., Trinity College (Women in Government); Carolyn M. Mazure, Ph.D., Yale University School of Medicine (Research on the Health of Women); Shyamala Raman, MBA, Ph.D., St. Joseph's College (Reflections on the Changing Trends for Women in the Emerging Global Economy); Andi Rierden, Fairfield University (For Women Offenders: More Sanctions and Fewer Prison Sentences) and Maria-Luz D. Sampler, Ph.D., University of Connecticut (Are the New Jobs Bringing Equality? ).
This edition took a broad look at the status of women, and compared data about the status of women now with the statistics about women in the past.
Where possible, we looked back to the early 1970's when the PCSW was created.
Some of our findings included: s Connecticut falls 29th in population among all the states in the United States.
The median age for women in Connecticut is 38.1 years, slightly older than males at 35.8 years.
The population for women in Connecticut has increased 1.5% since 1975.
The largest increase is for women over the age of 65, an increase of 5.6%.
The average life expectancy for women is 79.7 years.
s As women's responsibility for the economic well-being of their families grows, the continuing wage gap and the prevalence of women in low-paid female-dominated occupations impedes women's ability to ensure their families' financial security, particularly for single mothers.
In Connecticut, the median annual income for married couples with children is $67,000; for single parents with children it is $16,800.
The median income for single females is $17,600 and for single males it is $27,800.
Women also tend to earn less, live longer and have fewer years in the workforce than men.
In retirement, many only have Social Security on which to rely. s Women represent 51.4% of the total population in Connecticut and 48% of the Connecticut labor force.
71.6% of women with children under the age of 18 and 64.9% of women with children under the age of six participate in the labor force.
s The percentage of female officers at Connecticut's top 100 companies was 9%.
In 1975, there was only one woman Commissioner of a state agency.
In 1999, that number increased to six.
s Rates for women with AIDS in Connecticut are nearly double the national average.
Women in Connecticut comprise 27.9% of persons with AIDS. s Since Ella Grasso was the first woman elected governor, every statewide office in Connecticut has been held by at least one female.
In 2000, women held four of the six constitutional offices: Lt. Governor, Secretary of the State, Comptroller and Treasurer.
Twenty-one percent of the Mayors/First Selectpersons in Connecticut are women, Hartford County having the highest representation of women.
In 1975, Hartford County had no women in these elected positions.
s Women represent 34% of the membership on state boards and commissions, and 27% of the judges in Connecticut are women.
s The number of women in prison has increased dramatically.
In 1990, there were 595 incarcerated women.
At the beginning of the new millennium, there were 1,236 women serving time behind bars.
Over 66.2% of the women have dependents and as many as 78% have not finished high school.

We continue to enhance the information provided on our website and received over 4,000 "hits" in 2000.
In 2000, PCSW provided Sexual Harassment Prevention Training to over 1,000 state employees.
Training was provided at no cost to the employees of Legislative Management, the State Comptroller, the Attorney General's office, the CT Department of Labor, CT State Library and the PCSW's Pre-Apprenticeship Training Program.
PCSW published the twelfth edition of A Directory of Women's Organizations in Connecticut, a statewide, comprehensive list of women's organizations with over 500 entries.
The PCSW was further able to reach the public through broadcasts on the Connecticut Television Network (CTN) a public access television network based at the CT State Legislature.
CTN covered CT Women Entrepreneurs' Day and the activities of Take Our Daughters to Work Day.
We answered 1,152 press calls, conducted 84 radio interviews and appeared on 12 cable TV shows.
We organized and partnered to present 32 press conferences on current issues affecting the status of women.
As always, the PCSW is proud to share our expertise on issues such as the workplace, the economic status of women, welfare, domestic violence, voting, women's health, incarcerated women and legislative issues that affect women.

requests for information and referral
materials distributed
P
PCSW received nearly 4000 requests by phone for information and referrals in the year 2000.
While most of these phone requests were from individuals, we also received requests for information from legislators, employers, attorneys, state agencies, organizations and the media.
Of the callers, 640 (16%) requested the FACTS Book and 550 (13%) wanted PCSW's Women's Directory.
Pregnancy, Family 
We processed 170 (4%) requests for Nontraditional Occupations for Women (NTO), while 125 callers (3%) requested the Annual Report.
The largest percentage (55%) of processed requests falls under the category of "Other."
These 1,400 requests include questions about such diverse problems as employment and credit, gender discrimination and sexual harassment, cessation/interruption of insurance coverage due to job lay off and/or termination situations, and general questions about options.
T
The PCSW educational booklets, fact sheets and other materials are mailed to callers requesting information and are distributed at conferences, workshops and other events.
In 2000, we distributed approximately 4,000 copies of educational literature in response to telephone inquiries.
Additionally, we distributed over 20,000 pieces of educational literature at workshops and speaking engagements throughout the state.

The PCSW is mandated to receive complaints of sex discrimination and to assist complainants in filing formal charges with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO).
In 2000 we received 119 requests for formal complaint assistance.
Of those requests, 34 resulted in the filing of formal complaints with the CHRO.
Most of the inquiries about formal complaints concerned sex discrimination in employment and pregnancy discrimination.
