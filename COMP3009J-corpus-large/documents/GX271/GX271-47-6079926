Chapter IV Global and Domestic Market Trends Industry Trends The supply chain over which a container or commodity is routed from point A to Point B, in most cases, is directly correlated to the rate charged per unit or ton for the container or commodity."
The rate charged for moving the container or commodity is directly correlated to the type and weight of the commodity, the number of interchanges between modes of transport, the distance moved, the return of the container and transport equipment to the point of origin (whether loaded or empty) and the profit margins associated with the supply chain dictated by global market conditions"(A Five Â­ Year Plan to Accomplish the Mission of Florida's SeaportsExecutive Summary, 2001/2002-2005/2006).
Likewise, the same trend has taken place with truck lines, railroads, and with coastwise/inland barge owner operators.
There are several locations around the world where container on barge and break-bulk barge operations are providing competitive regularly scheduled services under these "new world" global market conditions.
Northern Europe, particularly the Netherlands and Germany along the Rhine River, have extensive barge and short-sea shipping networks.
In Rotterdam, trucks now carry less than half of the containers to and from the port because of the growing market share and economies of scale that barge operations offer.
In Antwerp
approximately 1.52 million containers were moved by barge from originating or terminating locations in 2000.
Between Rotterdam and Antwerp alone, over 850,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were moved in 2000.
In Germany, the Rhine River has become a regular water "highway" for scheduled barge operations.
Because of these factors and others, the structure of the international liner trade and freight transportation in general, has changed significantly since the early 1980s.
Large mergers and consolidations have taken place in both conference and non-conference liner shipping, e.g., Maersk/Sealand and Nedlloyd/P
These mega-companies move containers in numbers large enough to warrant dedicated berths or even dedicated ports in order to minimize cost, provide for competitive rates and maximize profit margins.
A case in point is Maersk/Sealand's operation of dedicated facilities (Universal) at the Port of Miami.
In the United States, the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington State and Idaho, the middle Atlantic Coast, and Texas serve as primary arteries for container on barge operations.
The Mississippi River has historically served as the bulk-barge operating corridor due to the extensive export and processing of grains from the heartland to the mouth of the Mississippi at New Orleans.
The Tennessee-
Tombigbee Waterway System located in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama has become a formidable shallow draft system for shipment of all products to
4-1
and from the southeastern United States via he Gulf of Mexico.
Along the Columbia and Snake River Systems, barges carried over 50,000 containers in 2000 between the Port of Portland and the Ports of Lewiston, Pasco, Umatilla, and Morrow-Boardman.
Commodities carried are primarily agricultural and forest products (bulk commodity).
Texas presently has one scheduled coastwise barge operation shipping mainly containers of foreign aid for a major foreign-owned shipping line and repositions empty containers back to point of origin.
Service is provided from the Galveston ship channel along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway to New Orleans and return.
The firm moved 50,000 containers in 2001.
Finally, the Port of New York and New Jersey has launched a unique barge and rail cargo distribution network known as the "Port Inland Distribution Network" that will move containerized cargo by barge and/or railroad between marine terminals in the New YorkNew Jersey area and regional terminals in New York, New Jersey and three other Northeast states.
Local trucking will then be used to bring cargoes from the regional port facilities to ultimate customer locations.
It will provide scheduled barge services for cargo such as furniture, clothing, beverages and will reduce truck congestion on main interstate and thoroughfare systems serving the New York/New Jersey areas.
Subsidies are offered by the Port Authority of New York/New Jersey to make the service appealing to potential shippers and customers.
Currently, 84 percent of the containers that come in to or go out of the Port are transported by truck.
It is projected that
when all port transfer facilities are on line by the year 2020, the percentage of maritime containers moved by truck could potentially be reduced by as much as 57 percent from current levels.
By then, over 1,000 truck trips/day on New York State roadways would be eliminated by implementation of the Port Inland Distribution Network.
Reduced truck miles traveled will improve air quality by eliminating truck emissions.
By 2020, hundreds of tons of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants will be eliminated as a result of the waterside barge cargo distribution network.
In September 2002, the Port Authority Board approved up to $6,000,000 to assist with start up costs for the Port Inland Distribution Network.
The Port Authority is continuing negotiations with inland port operators at Albany, Davisville (R.I.), Bridgeport and New Haven (Conn.), Camden and Salem (N.J.), and Wilmington (Del.) to make the Port Inland Distribution Network a success.
The generally accepted distance for cost-effective use of barge over truck or rail is approximately 1,300 miles as determined by a recent study conducted by the University of Arkansas.
Container on barge
operations in most cases can not be used for time sensitive cargoes due to generally longer transit times associated with water transport compared to either truck or railroad; and this being the case, inventory costs increase for commodities shipped by shallow draft or ocean going barge attributable to the increased time it takes to move them.
This factor may not be a disadvantage depending on the
4-2
commodity being shipped, the level of congestion experienced on the land side transportation system, and the delivery window required by the customer for final production processes.
For some bulk and breakbulk commodities, the barge acts as an inventory control mechanism which actually saves the customer money by foregoing the higher costs of storing commodity on site or near production facilities until it is ready for use.
In highly congested landside transportation regions, barge transport may very well be competitive or exceed transport times available through either railroad or truck transport.
For such operations to be economically feasible, a "critical mass" of containers and/or bulk/break-bulk product must be present to offset the time and inventory cost factors.
Given the same transport distance, the marginal cost of transport by barge is generally lower per ton of commodity than by any other mode provided sufficient volumes exist to offset material handling and transloading costs.
Regularly scheduled volume
geography allows for barges to take a shorter amount of time to travel between ports, and high population and employment densities mean a large demand for commodities between these relatively short distances.
Because of the higher cost of landside transportation for both rail and truck in Europe, governments have made deliberate efforts to create and finance shore side infrastructure at key locations to accommodate rapid and efficient trans-loading of containers, bulk, and break-bulk commodities from water to points of demand.
Congestion that exists at key port locations such as Rotterdam or Antwerp provide these
jurisdictions strong incentives to promote, and in some cases subsidize, alternative waterside transportation in lieu of truck and railroad.
Special synergies must be developed and nurtured in order for barge operations to be a viable alternative to existing land side transportation.
commitments are required to justify the initiation and long-term viability of barge services.
Additionally, in order to compete with rail and truck, door to door delivery service and not just port to port service must be implemented to be cost competitive.
In Europe, conditions that contribute to the successful use of shallow draft barge operations include large population and employment densities, smaller travel distances, high levels of land side congestion, high costs of competing modes (fuel and crew costs), and maturity of the intermodal container industry.
Europe's

Florida is beginning to experience these "European symptoms" that may very well be a prologue to increased coastwise barge use.
The Gulf Intracoastal and Atlantic Intracoastal system is in place and has been for almost 100 years.
Underutilized trade corridors of over 1,300 miles, they need to be marketed, revived, adequately maintained, enhanced with the proper infrastructure and government policy incentives, to fully recognize their resource potential and economic benefit to the State of Florida.
waters of Florida's Intracoastal and other waterway systems.
For purposes of this discussion, only
"scheduled commercial barge services" presently operating or historically operating in Florida that move or have moved containers, fuel oils, phosphate, or coal can be documented.
These are the major, but not all inclusive operators, using the present day intracoastal system.
Coastal Tug and Barge, Inc.
(Ship Handling and Coastal Barge)
Existing Barge Services and Lightering Operations Scheduled coastal shipping in Florida is presently quite limited.
As recently as 1999, only one major coastal shipping line was in scheduled commercial operation.
Columbia Coastal Transport provides weekly service between Charleston, S.C. and Miami, Florida.
Short sea shippers (open water operations), however, have been in operation for quite some time particularly regarding the domestic trade between Florida and Puerto Rico.
This system, separate and unique from coastwise operations, includes the operations of Trailer Bridge, Horizon Lines LLC., Crowley Marine Services, and Sea Star Line, LLC.
Coastal Tug and Barge, Inc. operates 9 tugs and 15 tank barges in and around the State of Florida.
Most operations are conducted in the major ports and harbors of Miami, Tampa, and Canaveral.
The firm does have one operation in the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway south of Miami.
On a daily basis, the firm transships a tank barge from its terminal in Miami on Fisher Island to the Florida Power and Light Plant at Turkey Point.
The firm delivers 12,000 barrels of fuel oil per trip (1,846 metric tons); because of the less than optimal water depth and environmental concerns of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway south of Miami, Coastal must use an 18,000 barrel barge lightered to 12,000 barrels to avoid grounding at the 5.6-7.0 foot depth of the waterway in that region.
The following analysis cannot be all inclusive since many products move by barge under contract on an "as needed basis" by many carriers, large and small.
(Appendix B) of this report identifies respondents, currently and historically, that have navigated the
Dredging of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway south of Miami may never happen, but this is a current example of commercial operations hampered by inadequate water depths at certain points in the channel.

Coastal also provides barge fuel services for ship bunkering in the southern most part of Port Everglades where no fueling pipelines exist.
A barge is sent periodically from Miami to Everglades for this purpose.
Depth problems between Miami and Everglades (Baker Haulover) in the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway require the operator to use open Atlantic waters for this transit, sometimes negating delivery due to inclement weather.
When this happens, congestion in Port Everglades results due to required ship repositioning for fueling within the Port.
Again, lack of maintenance dredging to the authorized 9 Â­ 12 foot level impedes commercial navigation in this region of the state.

The company offers weekly and twice weekly container services linking the ports of New York/New Jersey with Boston in the Northeast, Baltimore and New York in the Mid-Atlantic, Wilmington, Charleston and Miami in the Southeast, and Freeport, Bahamas in the West Indies.
Coastal also offers four weekly sailings in its Chesapeake service linking Baltimore and Norfolk.
The Company began an initial service with its "Columbia New York" container barge capable of transporting reefer cargoes into Port Canaveral in March of 2000.
Volumes necessary to sustain the service have not materialized although the company

The service is targeted at giving shippers in central Florida (Orlando) the option of routing through a local port rather than draying freight long distances by road.
Until economic volumes of containers are generated, however, the service will bypass Canaveral at the present time.

Trailer Bridge began its operations in 1991 with two roll-on roll-off barges providing weekly service between the Port of Jacksonville and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
In 1998 the Company received a federal Title XI loan guarantee of $16.9 million dollars to construct 3 deck (load-on, load-off) barges for a domestic coastal service between the Port of Jacksonville and New Jersey.
It also ordered 1,100 53 ft. domestic containers.
Trailer Bridge's coastal service was a combination of coastwise container transport and short-sea shipping (via Jacksonville to San Juan).
The sailing time between Jacksonville and New Jersey is about 4.5 days and between Jacksonville and San Juan, about 5 days.
Trailer Bridge designed a multi-port scheduled rotation between New Jersey/Jacksonville, Jacksonville/San Juan, San Juan/Jacksonville, and Jacksonville/New Jersey.
Weekly service was instituted with a full three weeks required for the entire port rotation schedule.

Hence, Trailer Barge offers a biweekly New Jersey/ San Juan and a twice-a-week Jacksonville San Juan service, but no New Jersey/Jacksonville service (The Puerto Rican market is served by four lines: Trailer Bridge, Crowley, Horizon Lines, and Sea Star.

Example of European Passenger and Cargo "Fast Ferry"
Florida's existing coastwise shipping system is primarily a push/pull flat deck barge operation calling at select deep water port terminals.
The barges handle bulk, neo-bulk (phosphate, fertilizer, or petroleum products) and in some cases, small numbers of containers in lightering and repositioning of loads or empty boxes (primarily for the domestic trade to Puerto Rico).

For a Florida coastwise domestic system to become competitive with either truck or railroad, it must be designed with dedicated domestic terminals that are on site and complement land side truck terminal operations.
These specially constructed terminals must be designed to handling smaller coastwise barge equipment, basic box handling and transfer equipment, and have Roll-on, Roll-off capabilities.
Service frequency, speed and reliability are the keys to making such a service successful; not necessarily cost; provided it is somewhat competitive with truck and/or railroad/intermodal.
Only a system with feeder service that can complement trucking operations in transit time, pickup and delivery frequency would generate the box volumes needed to sustain a viable domestic container coastwise operation.
trips per year.
Higher calling frequencies would enhance the system's competitiveness and also facilitate the creation of more sophisticated service patterns resulting in shorter trip times and less supply chain inefficiencies.
The study suggests that on Florida's east coast, a system having a concurrent northbound and southbound service loop between New York markets and Miami could handle a minimum of 467,000 truck-trips/year amounting to 75 million truck-miles/year; or about 14% of the total freight truck traffic utilizing the I-95 highway corridor between New York and Miami.

Port Canaveral (AIWW) Port Canaveral has been a landlord port for bulk and break bulk cargo operations since the mid-1950s and a cruise port for the past 20 years.
It is unique in that it is the only port anywhere having quadramodal service that connects four major modes of transportation: sea, land, air, and space.
The port operates as a landlord port authority and has developed into the world's third largest multi-day cruise port in the world.
It has also become a "niche" port for specific cargoes.
Cargoes presently handled through the port include petroleum, newsprint, fresh citrus, juices and concentrates, salt and cement.
The port has less than a mile direct access channel to the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and just twice that to the major Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes.
Being centrally located mid-state on the Atlantic Coast, it can take advantage of well-developed highway, rail, air, and space transportation systems making it a major economic and distribution center for the State of Florida.

Additionally, Norfolk Southern Corporation handles trailer loads of freight direct from all port piers and warehouses through agreements with the Florida East Coast Railway.
The Port has many advantages to becoming a future coastwise barge and short-sea shipping hub: First, Port Canaveral is undeniably the closest major seaport gateway to rapidly growing Central Florida and its major tourist attractions, only 44 miles away; second, Central Florida has become a major consumer market with unlimited growth potential; third, the majority of consumables are of foreign origin and must be imported to the region; fourth, most goods arriving in the region today are traveling via inland transportation Â­ truck and railroad Â­ to reach Central and South Florida; due to geographic location, major distribution centers are continuing to relocate and open in the Orlando area; and finally and most importantly, the global Hutchison-Whampoa, Ltd. container transshipment terminal hub has begun operating 180 miles to the east/southeast in Freeport, Bahamas.

and trucks are exported each month to Central America from port docks.
It ranks number one nationally for importing frozen concentrated orange juice and is the nation's leading export location for citrus juices and beverages.
The port currently has 5,230 feet of linear dock space and owns 1,064 acres of land.
It also has available approximately 500 additional acres for future development opportunities.
The planned completion for Berth 12/13 (Southport) is projected in the 2005/2008 timeframe and is estimated to have capacity to handle 336,000 twentyfoot equivalent units (TEUs) or 224,000 forty-foot equivalent units (FEUs) annually.
Port Manatee would be well positioned to become an end-hub for Gulf Intracoastal Waterway container transport, thus alleviating congestion on both the I-75 and I-4 land side interstate systems while at the same time, be in Port Manatee's location on Tampa Bay provides for relatively short vessel steaming times from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.

Port of Pensacola (GIWW) The Port of Pensacola is a "niche" port having facilities and infrastructure that can accept diverse cargoes on a relatively short notice, but currently has a limited 50 acres of port property to warehouse and transload maritime cargoes.
The port does not have the infrastructure and land side access to accommodate large deep-draft vessels in excess of 33 ft., but is in very close proximity to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and in fact, currently has barge calls from Martin Marietta (bulk aggregates), Coastal Fuels (bunker oil/fuels) and Reynolds Redi-Mix Corporation.
Current cargo mix includes: lumber, pipe, frozen produce, aggregates, rice, flour, asphalt, sulfur (neobulk and liquid bulk), pulp, scrap iron, granite, and some petroleum based fuels.

The port is within 100 miles of Mobile, Alabama, Gulfport, Mississippi, and Panama City, Florida.
The entrance channel is maintained to a mean low water depth of 35 feet and 500 feet wide at the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico; the protected inner Bay Channel is maintained at 33 feet by 300 feet as are the inner harbor/approach channels.
Berths 1,2,3,5, and 6 are maintained at 33 feet mean low water; berth 7 is maintained at 16 feet (barge mooring location), and berth 15 is maintained at 18 feet.

Port of Panama City (GIWW) The Port of Panama City, approximately 100 miles east of Pensacola, also currently experiences barge call activity.
Between 1999/2000 Â­ 2001/2002, the Port realized on average 200 loaded barge calls per year (15/month) of mostly aggregates (Martin-Marietta), fertilizers, rolled steel, steel plate, steel pipe (Berg Steel), and even some limited container and wood pulp cargoes.
Gulf Power is extremely interested in seeing the dredging project on the Escambia River completed on schedule in 2003 to provide for more efficient fuel delivery operations.

The port has recently completed its West Dock rehabilitation project to better accommodate barge call activity and is currently actively pursuing its South Dock Expansion project.
The port, in conjunction with the South Dock Expansion has programmed $1,800,000.00 on reinforcement of the waterside structure; $1,500,000.00 for building and reinforcing the apron behind, and has committed $1,800,000.00 in port revenues and local funds to dredged the West Dock berths to in excess of 33 feet.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has programmed $8,000,000.00 for 2003 to dredge the approaches and turning basin of the port.

The Barge Terminal in Northern St. Andrews Bay (services Gulf-Power's Lansing Smith Steam Generatoring Plant) currently has 600 feet of shallow draft berthing space, a concrete apron constructed of steel sheet piling, transit shed capacity of 30,000 feet, bulk transfer handling capability, and paved open storage of 90,000 square feet.
Covered railroad loading and unloading capability is also available.
Port St. Joe (GIWW) Port St. Joe (formerly St. Joseph) with its natural harbor protected by the St. Joseph's Peninsula barrier island is the oldest commercial port facility in Florida.
Its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, pristine timber land in the Panhandle, and the 1835 construction of railroad service to the region to extract the region's natural resources made it a hub of commercial activity in the early and mid 1800's.
Cotton and timber from Florida, Georgia and Alabama were easily shipped through Port St. Joseph to Appalachicola, there transferred to rail and to ship for transport to domestic and international markets.

The Port's present channel and harbor were dredged

to existing depths ranging from 35 to 37 feet in 1962.
Some limited maintenance dredging was conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1973, 1980 and 1985.
Between 1940 and 1980, the port was very active and handled petroleum, cotton, timber, chemicals, paper, rosin, turpentine, and various agricultural commodities primarily for local and regional distribution.
From the mid 1980s to mid 1994, port activity declined until Material Transfer, Inc. successfully secured contracts with Panhandle utilities and other regional utilities to transport bulk coal by barge through the port; trans-load to rail road for final shipment and delivery.
Coal came from the Midwest, cross-gulf to St. Joe for distribution.
Between 1994 and 1998, Materials Transfer handled over 2,400,000 million tons per year or approximately 12,000,000 tons over the five year period.
Over 800 barge shipments terminated at the port during that time.
However, Materials Transfer lost the contracts for transport of the coal to Seminole Electric Coop., Inc.
(Putnam County-3.5 million metric tons of coal per year) and the coal once coming by barge is now wholely transported by rail road on the CSXT system bypassing Port St. Joe.
This development, as well as the closing of the paper mill adjacent to the port has somewhat hindered the ability of the port to move forward even though it is extremely well positioned to expand in other market areas.
property prompting the Port Authority to develop plans to build facilities to capture this trade.
The Port recently purchased 26 acres from St. Joe Company to be used in the future for this cargo.
Aggregate business is also being pursued although it is a high volume and low value commodity.
The harbor and ship channel from the deep water and Gulf Intracoastal was originally developed around the St. Joseph's peninsula leading into the bay to serve the dock at the former paper mill site.
The authorized project depth averages 35 Â­ 37 feet deep at mean low water and the project was authorized under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945.
It was completed in 1962 for a total cost of $1,980,862.
However, due to lack of use, the subsequent closing and demolition of the paper mill, the controlling depth for ship channel access has been limited to 27 feet.
The Gulf County Canal is a tributary of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and is about six miles long.
It connects the Intracoastal Waterway to St. Joseph's Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.
The channel, including the canal, is maintained to a depth of 12 feet mean low water and a width of 125 feet.
In the early 1980s, the Port Authority paid the Florida Department of Transportation over $2,000,000.00 in local revenues to elevate the U.S. 98 George Tapper Bridge over the Gulf County Canal to 75 feet to allow for

To date, Port St. Joe is a resource that has yet to be fully recognized or utilized by the State of Florida.
In its recently completed Port Master Plan, the U.S. Department of Commerce RIMSII (Regional InputOutput Model System II) was applied.
The economic impacts measured and projected were quite substantial for both the State and Gulf County.
If the port is made fully operational as planned, the model estimated that perhaps as many as 445 people could be employed, 586 new jobs could be created in the county to support port-related services and activities, and 1,287 new jobs would be attributable to multiplier effects (secondary benefits) for the State of Florida.
existing or easily constructed infrastructure necessary to accommodate future barge and short-sea shipping operations.
Given its location, availability to land, good land side connections, and proximity to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway via the Gulf County Canal, it is well positioned given the right mix of capital and political support, to become a key player in any revival of coastwise barge container and bulk operations.
Based on the limited research conducted thus far, the five previously mentioned and currently existing port facilities described appear to offer the best locations for potential future development of either
