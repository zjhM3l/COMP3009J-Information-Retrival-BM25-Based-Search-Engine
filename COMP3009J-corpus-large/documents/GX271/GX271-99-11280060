Texas Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Projects Railroad Commission of Texas Surface Mining and Reclamation Division Texas Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Â­ (11/02) August 3, 1977, the United States Congress passed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA).
This act established national coal mining and reclamation standards and created the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) within the U.S. Department of Interior.
The Act also established the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund to reclaim mine lands that had been abandoned and left inadequately reclaimed.
Abandoned mines are eligible for reclamation under the Texas Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program, if all mining had ceased and the mine was abandoned prior to June 20, 1975, for coal and uranium and August 3, 1977, for all other types of mining.
Funding for the Texas Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program is provided by a federal reclamation fee levied on each ton of coal mined in Texas.
These fees are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Trust Fund maintained by the U.S. Treasury.
The U.S. Congress makes a yearly appropriation from the Fund to OSM.
Texas receives an annual distribution from OSM's appropriation according to a formula established by OSM.
The Texas AML Reclamation Program is currently authorized and funded by the U.S. Congress through 2004.
Reclamation projects are selected from the Texas AML Program's prioritized inventory of abandoned mines.
The AML staff contacts the landowner of the selected project, describes the AML program and proposed reclamation before securing a right-of-entry.
The AML staff prepares reclamation designs and obtains environmental permits and clearances for the proposed AML project.
The AML staff prepares construction bid documents, work specifications, and competitively bids the reclamation work.
A contractor is selected and awarded a contract to complete the reclamation.
The Texas AML staff then inspects and manages the reclamation and reclamation contractor.
The Texas AML Program has reclaimed 2,160 acres of abandoned surface mined land and closed 400 abandoned dangerous underground mine openings in 13 Texas Counties as of January 1, 2001.
The Texas AML Program certified completion of all available coal AML reclamation in 1992 and has since been focusing on abandoned surface uranium mines in south Texas and abandoned hardrock mines in west Texas.
Texas AML reclamation efforts are summarized in the following three sections: Coal Uranium Hardrock

COAL The two basic types of coal deposits mined in Texas are bituminous coal and lignite.
Prior to the 1950s, both types of coal were mined by primarily underground methods.
Bituminous coal was mined in 15 north central Texas counties between the late 1800s until the 1920s.
Bituminous coal was also mined in south Texas between Laredo and Eagle Pass during roughly the same period.
Lignite was mined from deposits located along a narrow belt from Texarkana to San Antonio.
Most of these deposits were mined by underground methods from the late 1800s till the 1920s.
In the 1940s and early 1950s, surface lignite mines were developed primarily as boiler fuel for electricity generation.
The Texas AML Reclamation Program has completed nine coal or lignite projects.
These range in size from a one-acre subsidence feature backfill to a 1,100 acre abandoned surface mine reclamation project.
Health and Safety Health and safety hazards associated with abandoned underground coal mines include: Â·Deep abandoned shafts Â·Unstable mine roofs Â·Toxic or harmful gases Health and safety hazards associated with abandoned surface coal mines include: Â·Unstable highwalls Â·Deep steep-sided pit impoundments Â·Unstable spoil piles Stay out!

Environmental Abandoned spoil piles and highwalls are often poorly vegetated and severely eroded.
Abandoned spoil is often acidic, thereby preventing plant growth and occasionally producing acid mine drainage.
Reclamation Most underground coal mines are reclaimed by simply backfilling the mine opening or subsidence feature with compacted fill.
The disturbance is generally retopsoiled and seeded.
Terraces may be constructed to divert water away from the mine closure.
Surface mine reclamation is generally more complex.
The components for a typical surface coal AML project are as follows: Â· Â· Â· Â· Grade spoil and highwall (dewater pit if necessary).
Treat graded spoil with lime (crushed limestone) Construct water control structures Revegetate Plant temporary cover crops (wheat, millet) Plant permanent grass species and sometimes trees Manage vegetation prior to releasing to landowner

URANIUM Uranium deposits were first discovered in Texas in 1954 along a 300-mile belt that extended from east-central Texas to south Texas.
Twenty-five prospects were defined and estimated to contain approximately five percent of the proven U.S. uranium reserves.
Open pit mining of shallow oxidized uranium ore bodies began in 1959.
Mining of deeper (90 to 300 feet) unoxidized ore bodies began in 1963.
Mining activity increased as a result of the 1970s "energy crisis" and then declined in 1979 when uranium ore prices dropped.
Twenty-three uranium pits were mined and abandoned prior to 1975, when the Texas Surface Mining and Reclamation Act went into effect.
These abandoned pits occur in Karnes, Atascosa and Live Oak Counties (Figure 2).
The individual uranium mines usually consist of an open pit and associated piles.
The walls of the pit (highwalls) are nearly vertical and range in height 20 to 120 feet.
Groundwater usually collects in the pit to a depth of 20 to 80 Spoil piles generally have a steep slope (33% or greater) and are 20 to 80 high.
Health and Safety Health and safety hazards associated with abandoned surface uranium mines include: Â· Â· Â· Â· Unstable highwalls Deep steep-sided pit impoundments Unstable spoil Localized areas of radioactive spoil spoil from feet.

Environmental The highwalls and spoil piles are often poorly vegetated and severely eroded.
Mine spoil erosion degrades water quality and causes sedimentation problems on adjacent unmined land.
The spoil can contain acidic and saline materials that prevent vegetation establishment.
Metals such as molybdenum, arsenic and selenium may be found in concentrations that are toxic to plants and animals.
Reclamation Abandoned open pit uranium mines are reclaimed in two phases; 1) earthwork and 2) revegetation.
The earthwork phase generally includes the following: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Pit de-watering Burial of radioactive and acidic spoil Regrading or recontouring highwalls and spoil Construction of water control structures Topsoiling of all reclamation ground disturbance
The revegetation phase generally includes the following: Â· Establishment of temporary cover crops (e.g. wheat or millet) Â· Establishment of permanent grass species Â· Management of vegetation prior to release to landowner Summary of Texas Uranium AML Reclamation Project Costs E.

Typical reclamation progression of abandoned uranium mine.
Dozers and scrapers are employed to salvage all topsoil from the disturbance area, prior to any heavy earthwork.
Heavy earthwork equipment is used to place mine spoil back into the abandoned pit.
Low ground pressure dozers are used to construct a stable pit floor.
After the pit floor is stabilized, larger excavation equipment is used to flatten the pit walls.

HARD ROCK The Texas AML Reclamation Program has closed abandoned hard rock mine openings in three west Texas Counties (Brewster, Culberson and El Paso).
Cinnabar or mercury ore was mined over a large area in Brewster County.
Copper was mined from a small area in the Guadalupe Mountains in Culberson County.
Tin was mined from the Franklin Mountains in El Paso County.
The AML Program has closed 374 hardrock mine openings to date.
Efforts to close these mine openings began in 1982, after a teenager fell to his death in one of the openings in the Terlingua Ghost Town.
Health and Safety Health and safety hazards associated with abandoned hard rock mines include: Â· Â· Â· Â· Falling into open shafts Roof cave-ins Collapse of mine facilities and equipment Bad or toxic air
Stay out! Stay alive! Reclamation A variety of closure types are employed to remediate safety hazards associated with abandoned hard rock mines.
Shallow vertical shafts are generally backfilled.
Deeper vertical shafts are closed with steel grating or a steel reinforced concrete cap.
Sometimes steel cable netting is used to cover shafts located in difficult terrain.
Deeper shafts that may be used as bat entryways are usually closed with an angle-iron bat gate cupola.
Adits or portals (horizontal mine openings) leading to shallow underground workings are generally closed with rock and mortar walls.
Adits or portals leading to deeper workings that may contain bat roosting habitat are closed with angle iron bat gates.

The bulk of the Texas AML Reclamation Program's hard rock reclamation efforts have been focused on abandoned cinnabar (mercury ore) mines in the Terlingua Quicksilver Mining District.
Cinnabar mining began in the Big Bend area in the late 1800s and peaked during World War I and World War II.
Mining essentially ceased in the 1960s.
Most of the mining activity was located near Terlingua, Study Butte, in the Christmas Mountains, in Big Bend National Park, and at the Lone Star/Mariposa mines, about halfway between Terlingua and Lajitas.
