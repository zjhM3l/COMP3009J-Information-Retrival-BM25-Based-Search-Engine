SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments
We encourage you to participate in this rulemaking by submitting comments and related material.
If you do so, please include your name and address, identify the docket number for this rulemaking [CGD07-02- 151], indicate the specific section of this document to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment.
Please submit all comments and related material in an unbound format, no larger than 8\1/2\ by 11 inches, suitable for copying.

We will consider all comments and material received during the comment period.
We may change this proposed rule in view of them.
We anticipate making this proposed rule effective less than 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register because the event is scheduled for February 2, 2003 and we want to allow enough time for the public to comment on this proposed rule.
Public Meeting
A public meeting has not been scheduled for this proposed rule.
However, you may submit a request for a meeting by writing to Bridge Branch, Seventh Coast Guard District, 909 SE 1st Ave, Room 432, Miami, FL 33131, explaining why one would be beneficial.
If we determine that one would aid this rulemaking, we will hold one at a time and place announced by a later notice in the Federal Register.
Background and Purpose
The Miami Tropical Marathon Director has requested that the Coast Guard temporarily change the existing regulations governing the operation of the East and West Spans of the Venetian Causeway bridges, and the Brickell Avenue and Miami Avenue bridges to allow them to remain in the closed position during the running of the Miami Tropical Marathon on February 2, 2003.
The marathon route passes over these four bridges and any bridge opening would disrupt the race.
Based on the limited time the bridges would be closed, the Coast Guard believes it can accommodate the request while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.
The East and West Spans of the Venetian Causeway bridges are located between Miami and Miami Beach.
The current regulation governing the operation of the East Span of the Venetian Causeway bridge is published in 33 CFR 117.269 and requires the bridge to open on signal; except that, from November 1 through April 30 from 7:15 a.m. to 8:45 a.m. and from 4:45 p.m. to 6:15 p.m. Monday through Friday, the draw need not be opened.
[[Page 77950]]
However, the draw shall open at 7:45 a.m., 8:15 a.m., 5:15 p.m., and 5:45 p.m., if any vessels are waiting to pass.
The draw shall open on signal on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New Year's Day, and Washington's Birthday.
Moreover, the bridge must open for public vessels of the United States, tugs with tows, regularly scheduled cruise vessels, and vessels in distress.
The regulation governing the West Span of the Venetian Causeway bridge is published in 33 CFR 117.5 and requires the bridge to open on signal.
The operating schedule of the Brickell Avenue and Miami Avenue bridges is published in 33 CFR 117.305 and requires each bridge to open on signal; except that, from 7:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday except Federal holidays, the draws need not be opened for the passage of vessels.
Public vessels of the United States and vessels in an emergency involving danger to life or property are allowed to pass at any time.
We believe that this proposed rule would not adversely affect the reasonable needs of navigation due to the limited time the bridges would be in the closed position.
Discussion of Proposed Rule
The Coast Guard proposes to temporarily change the operating regulations of the East and West Spans of the Venetian Causeway bridges, and the Brickell Avenue and Miami Avenue bridges on February 2, 2003.
This proposed rule would allow the East Span of the Venetian Causeway bridge to remain closed from 6:10 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. on February 2, 2003.
The proposed rule would allow the West Span of the Venetian Causeway to remain closed from 6:15 a.m. to 9:20 a.m. on February 2, 2003.
The Brickell Avenue bridge would be allowed to remain closed from 7:10 a.m. to 11:59 a.m. on February 2, 2003.
The Miami Avenue bridge would be allowed to remain closed from 6:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. on February 2, 2003.
Public vessels of the United States and vessels in distress shall be passed at anytime.
Regulatory Evaluation
This proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order.
The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that Order.
It is not ``significant'' under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979).
We expect the economic impact of this proposed rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because preliminary data indicates that there have been limited numbers of requests for openings during these time periods and this proposed rule still provides for regular openings throughout the day.
Small Entities
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The term ``small entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the proposed rule will only be in effect for a limited period of time and race committee officials are working with affected parties to minimize the impact of this proposed rule.
If you think that your business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this rule would have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment to the address under ADDRESSES.
In your comment, explain why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it.
Assistance for Small Entities
Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-121), we want to assist small entities in understanding this proposed rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking.
If this proposed rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please consult the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
We also have a point of contact for commenting on actions by employees of the Coast Guard.
Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards.
The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business.
If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247).
Collection of Information
This proposed rule would call for no new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).
Federalism
A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial direct cost of compliance on them.
We have analyzed this proposed rule under that Order and determined that it does not have implications for federalism.
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) requires federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions not specifically required by law.
In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 or more in any one year.
Although this proposed rule would not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.
Taking of Private Property
This proposed rule would not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.
Civil Justice Reform
This proposed rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.
Protection of Children
We have analyzed this proposed rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks.
This rule is not an economically significant rule and would not create an environmental risk to health or risk to
[[Page 77951]]
safety that might disproportionately affect children.
Environment
We have considered the environmental impact of this proposed rule and concluded that, under figure 2-1, paragraph (32)(e), of Commandant Instruction M16475.lD, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket where indicated under ADDRESSES.
Indian Tribal Governments
This proposed rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it would not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.
Energy Effects
We have analyzed this proposed rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions Concerning Regulations that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use.
We have determined that it is not a ``significant energy action'' under that order because it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy.
It has not been designated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as a significant energy action.
Therefore, it does not require a statement of Energy Effects under Executive Order 13211.
