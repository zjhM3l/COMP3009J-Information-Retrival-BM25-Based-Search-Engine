Since the office of the secretary-treasurer usually rotates annually from one State or Federal Government land management agency office, or scientific institution, to another, it is suggested that those who desire to secure copies address their inquiries to the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Washington 25, D.C., or to the Bureau of Sports Fisheries and Wildlife at the same address, to secure the address of the council's current secretary-treasurer.
