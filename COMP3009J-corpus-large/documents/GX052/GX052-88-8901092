Official Text _________________________________________________________________ # 266/96 September 10, 1996 CLINTON Q
He said he'd like to do more to help the besieged Kurd population in northern Iraq, but insisted Kurdish leaders first have to arrange an end to the factional strife there.
Clinton, taking questions from reporters during a September 9 ceremony on airport safety, said the major brunt of the fighting in northern Iraq now is between Kurdish factions, including one backed by tanks and armored infantry units deployed by Saddam Hussein.
"We have done everything we could to make it clear to the Kurds that we think there should not be any cavalier killing of civilians and others who are not combatants in this," the president said.
Clinton told reporters Washington has "done a great deal" over the years to help the Kurdish population, but he said again the Kurds themselves "make it more difficult" when leaders "continue to promote fights" internally.
"As you might expect," he added, "Saddam Hussein would try to take advantage of that."
The president said he'd like to do more to help the Kurds, but added they must first help themselves.
"If the fighting is to end," he noted, "the leaders of the various factions are going to have to be willing to go back to the peace table and talk it through ... that's a decision they're going to have to make, which will have a lot to do with the fate of their own people."
The official transcript of the president's replies to questions on Iraq follows:

Q: Mr. President, in Iraq are we abandoning Kurdish rebels who took a stand against Saddam Hussein and now are being hunted down by his forces?
CLINTON: Well, what we know of what is happening is that the Kurdish forces themselves are continuing to fight.
Obviously, Saddam Hussein is supporting one side over another now.
But the primary fight is being carried on between ... the Kurdish forces.
We're doing everything we can to get out of Iraq American citizens and those who have worked with us.
And we have done everything we could to make it clear to the Kurds that we think that there should not be any cavalier killing of civilians and others who are not combatants in this.
As to the intelligence matters, I can't comment.
But we are doing everything that we believe we can do and that we think is appropriate.
Q: Mr. President, do those that you are trying to get out of Iraq include the members of the Iraqi National Congress, who are apparently holed up in a mountain hideaway somewhere and hoping for political asylum?
CLINTON: I think it would be better for me not to comment now.
I'd like to stay with my first statement.
We're doing everything, we think, we can to help anybody that needs to be out of Iraq.
Q: Mr. President, what are your concerns about the building strength of Saddam's ground forces, though?
CLINTON: Well, the main thing that we wanted to say was, first of all, the United States has done a great deal to help the Kurds over the years.
And we've worked very hard.
They make it more difficult to help them when their leaders continue to promote fights within the Kurds, within the Kurdish faction.
And as you might expect, Saddam Hussein would try to take advantage of that.
Our ability to control internal events in Iraq is limited, but what we did do, which I thought was important, was when we found that what he had done contravened the U.N. resolution and constituted repression of his own people by carrying forward the military attack on Irbil himself; what we did was to expand the no-fly zone and enforce it and take out air defenses, which means that every day he has to pay a price in terms of his capacity to maneuver in his own country and threaten his neighbors.
And so we have done what we thought was appropriate there.
I would still like to do more to help the Kurds but, frankly, if you want the fightingfor the fighting to be ended, the leaders of the various factions are going to have to be willing to go back to the peace table and talk it through.
We have worked very hard with them, but that's a decision they're going to have to make, which will have a lot to do with the fate of their own people.
