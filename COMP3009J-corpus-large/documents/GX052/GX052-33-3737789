A Guide to the Microform Collections: Index by Format and Subject K-Z
Introduction | Index A-J | Index K-Z A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K-L | M | N | O | P-Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X-Z
In this index references to entries are listed by title under format and subject headings.
Entries themselves are arranged alphabetically in the text.
Format (e.g. Books; Correspondence; Pamphlets) and Subject (e.g. Germany--History; Slavery and antislavery) headings have been interfiled below in one single alphabet.
Format headings have been adapted from Library of Congress usage for this index, and have been interpreted broadly (e.g. "Archives" is used for records of governments, organizations, and other institutions).
Subject headings follow Library usage as far as possible, but are simplified, or used broadly, for this index (e.g., the subdivision "--History" is often used without specifying a chronological period).
Every effort was made to be as accurate and inclusive as possible, but some microform collections are by their nature hard to categorize.
In using the index readers should try all possible approaches in order to make the search productive.
