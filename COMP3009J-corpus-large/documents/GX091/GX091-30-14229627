[ars150.gif] TEKTRAN __________________________________________________________________ VISCOSITY AND MICROWAVE COOKING PROPERTIES OF SUGAR/MILKFAT COMPOSITES Author(s): ONWULATA CHARLES I HOLSINGER VIRGINIA H Interpretive Summary: Milk components are important ingredients in candy making where they contribute flavor, texture and color to such products as caramels and toffee.
Confectionary syrups made from sugars and fats are also routinely used as ingredients in the candy industry.
Since world-wide surpluses of butterfat are growing, new uses need to be developed.
In this study, we evaluated the viscous and microwave cooking properties of syrups with 20 to 40% milkfat and containing sucrose, high fructose corn syrup or maltose as the sugar.
We found that microwave heating of the syrups for 60 seconds formed toffee-like candies with colors that varied, depending on the sugar used.
Our results demonstrate that candy makers can readily use blends of these syrups to achieve a desirable color and texture for manufacture of toffees or caramels.
