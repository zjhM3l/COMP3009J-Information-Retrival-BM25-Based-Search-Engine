About the Champlin Foundations
The Champlin Foundations are private foundations that make direct grants for capital needs to tax-exempt organizations, substantially all in Rhode Island.
Typical capital needs are the purchase of equipment, construction, renovations, purchases of real property, and reduction of mortgage indebtedness.
One very important aim of these foundations is to provide funds to those tax-exempt organizations in Rhode Island who serve - or are available to serve - the broadest possible segment of the population.
