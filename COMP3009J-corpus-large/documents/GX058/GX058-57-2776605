Wood you care to know? __________________________________________________________________
* Pileated woodpeckers are the largest of our resident woodpeckers.
They are crow-sized.
* They have a large red crest, black back and white underwing color.
* Males have a red mustache that females lack.
* They are most commonly seen flying across roads or pastures into an adjacent forest.
* Their undulating flight pattern * distinguishes this species from crows.
* Pileated woodpecker nests usually are located in bottomlands or ravines in large diameter trees.
* They may take as long as 30 days to excavate a cavity.
* The average territory size for one breeding pair in Missouri is 130 to 400 acres.
Red-headed Woodpecker [56.jpg] Red-headed Woodpecker
Melanerpes erythrocephalus
Hard-nosed facts __________________________________________________________________
* found statewide, but most abundant in northern half of state * 9 inches long * eats acorns, fruit, plant and animal material * breeds in deciduous woodlands and open areas with scattered trees * nests in cavities excavated in barkless snags or dead stubs on live trees; also uses natural cavities * female and male incubate four to five eggs for 12 to 13 days * young fledge in 27 to 30 days * call is a loud "kweer" or "kwee-arr," given in short series * drums softly in short bursts
Wood you care to know? __________________________________________________________________
* Red-headed woodpeckers are easy to identify because they are the only woodpecker in the eastern U.S. with a solid red head.
* The males and females look alike.
* Their young have brown heads that don't turn red until their first winter.
* Red-headed woodpeckers have tried to adapt to modern landscapes; as large, towering trees became scarce, this species switched to using utility poles and cavities in buildings for nest sites.
* Creosote-coated utility poles are lethal to eggs and young reared in them.
* In winter, some individuals will migrate southward to areas where there is an abundance of acorns, which they often seal in cavities with splinters of wood.
* This species is declining significantly in parts of its range.
Yellow-bellied Sapsucker [55.jpg] [55-1.jpg]
Sphyrapicus varius
Hard-nosed facts __________________________________________________________________
* uncommon winter resident * 8.5 inches in length * eats tree sap and cambium, fruit, berries, insects and nuts * lives in mixed deciduous and coniferous forests * nests in cavities excavated in live birch, poplar and aspen; often near water * female and male incubate five to six eggs for 12 to 13 days * young fledge in 25 to 29 days * call is a "chur" or "quarr" given in series * drums are usually two to three rapid beats followed by a series of double and triple beats within 2 to 4 seconds
Wood you care to know? __________________________________________________________________
* Sapsuckers have white rumps and white patches on their shoulders.
* Males have a red throat that females lack.
* These woodpeckers have an odd habit of drilling tiny holes in tree bark in neatly spaced rows, and then returning to them to feed on the sap that oozes out or on insects attracted to the sap.
* They guard sap wells from other birds, squirrels and chipmunks by swooping and squawking at them.
* Sapsucker sap wells provide a food source for migrating hummingbirds.
* They drill wells and eat sap from 246 native tree species.
* The young learn sapsucking by observing their parents once they leave the nest.
* Male and female sapsuckers perform drumming duets to strengthen their courtship bond.
ENDANGERED Woodpeckers:
[59.jpg] Ivory-billed Woodpecker Campephilus principalis
Extirpation means no longer living in a certain location or place.
Extinction is forever.
Extinct animals or plants no longer live anywhere.
Until recently, the ivory-billed woodpecker was believed to be extinct.
Although this sleek and secretive giant no longer graces the forested swamps of the southeastern U.S., a few individuals may have managed to hang on in the mountains of eastern Cuba.
In the U.S., extensive logging of bottomland and virgin cypress forests during the late 1800s and early 1900s led to the demise of the ivory-billed woodpecker, which once lived in southeastern Missouri.
The species decline was especially swift because a single breeding pair needs about three square miles of undisturbed forest for its territory.
Wood-boring beetles and grubs that infested dead and dying trees were the ivory-bill's principal foods.
The loud, excited "yamp, yamp, yamp" calls it made were similar to the sound produced by a clarinet mouthpiece.
It is unlikely that sound will ever be heard again in the U.S.
Our national will to save the ivory-billed woodpecker wasn't strong enough in 1948, when the last mature forest that supported these birds along the Tensas River in Louisiana was cleared for agriculture.
[60.jpg] Red-cockaded Woodpecker Picoides borealis
Red-cockaded woodpeckers are somewhat different from other North American woodpeckers because they live in family groups called clans.
The clans are composed of a mated pair, their offspring of the year and, occasionally, unmated male helpers.
This amounts to a cooperative breeding arrangement where the clan excavates cavities in a cluster of trees for nest and roost sites and vigorously defends a 40- to 80-acre territory.
It takes two years or more to excavate a cavity because the building sites are always living pine trees, which have much harder wood than dead and decaying trees.
Above and below each cavity the birds also excavate tiny holes--resin wells--from which pine resin flows.
The oozing, sticky resin helps keep climbing black rat snakes from reaching their cavities and preying on eggs and young.
The advantage of all this hard work is that cavities excavated in living trees can last decades.
This southeastern U.S. woodpecker depends on open canopied, mature pine forests that are periodically thinned by fire.
Populations of red-cockaded woodpeckers have been vulnerable to elimination, fragmentation or modification of those forests by people.
The species was extirpated from Missouri because wild fires were suppressed, and virgin short-leaf pine forests of the southern Ozarks were logged in the early 1900s.
The last reported red-cockaded woodpecker colony disappeared shortly after the last stand of virgin short-leaf pine was cut in the spring of 1946 along Highway 19, just south of Round Spring in Shannon County.
The closest population to Missouri today lives in the western Ouachita Region of Arkansas.

HELPING Woodpeckers:
There are a few basic things urban and rural landowners can do to provide places for woodpeckers to feed and nest: * Don't cut down snags--standing dead or dying trees--that provide insect food and places to roost and nest.
* Don't prune diseased or dead tree limbs if it's safe to leave them.
They also provide insect food and places to excavate cavities.
* Living trees provide replacements for snags which will eventually fall over and decompose.
Three snags or more per acre should be left standing.
* Let large logs lie.
They provide habitat for the insects that woodpeckers eat.
* Some species will make use of nest boxes if wood chips--not sawdust--are provided for them in the cavity and placed in a wooded location.
* Destroy the nests of starlings and house sparrows.
These non-native birds often take over the freshly excavated nest cavities of woodpeckers.
* Place suet, which offers a source of quick energy, in small wire cages, nylon mesh bags or a short section of log drilled with several 1-inch-diameter holes and hung or attached to the side of a tree or pole.
Note: suet becomes rancid and harmful to birds in temperatures higher than 70 degrees.
* Black oil sunflower seed is consumed out of feeders by some woodpecker species.
* Landscape your yard with native trees, shrubs and vines--especially nut-and-fruit bearing species.
