It seems a few Hoosiers had the same thought, and have opened ch ocolate factories, soda fountains, and candy production lines with a personal touch throughout the state.
So if your sweet tooth is demanding to be heard, hop in the car and head out to sample these Indiana creations.
It started with treats for the home team.
Which is the better dream come true? Your father has a chocolate company; or you grow up and start your own? Maybe Mark Tarner is the best person to answer that question.
Over the years, Cathy Brand's world travels and research taught her much about making high quality, world-class chocolates.
In 1987, she opened her first shop, combining her last name with "De," the French prefix for "from."
Today, DeBrand chocolates are available at three chocolate cafes (Fort Wayne/North, 260.482.4373, Fort Wayne/Southwest, 260.432.5050, and Indianapolis/North, 317.466.1100) and through mail order (800.482.4373).
The company has grown to eight stores in northern Indiana and six franchised locations throughout the state.
But perhaps the best place to taste the product is right where it's made.
The 16,000 square foot factory, complete with an outlet store and cafÃ¯Â¿Â½, is open for tours.
The free Basic Factory Tour lasts about 20 minutes and features chocolate production and fresh-off-the-line samples.
The Inside Scoop Tour ($4 for adults, $1 for children) lasts about 30 minutes and includes some "chocolate surprises."
All tours are scheduled by appointment; tour group sizes are limited to 10 people.
Candy that travels well.
And far.
Where do old-fashioned candy making techniques and the space program meet?
At Wolf's Homemade Candies (888.98.CANDY) in Attica.
For 75 years, the folks at Wolfs have been making candy and chocolates with recipes that have been handed down from one generation to the next.
You can order boxes in sizes ranging from eight pieces to 140.
Or, take along as much as you can fit in your spaceship; Wolf's candies have been requested by NASA astronauts to accompany them in space.
A shop for all seasons.
What's summer without chocolate malts? And what's Christmas without candy canes?
Thanks to McCord Candies, Lafayette residents and guests will never have to find out.
This soda fountain and ice cream store opened its doors in 1912; in 1917 a man named Ivey McCord got his first "taste" of the business when he was employed as a candy maker.
A mere 30 years later, in 1947, Mr. McCord bought the business, and his family ran the store for the next 35 or so years.
Although McCord Candies has had several owners since, traditional, old-fashioned treats have always been available.
Chocolate malts, cherry Cokes, lemon sodas, and sundaes rank high among the frosty favorites.
In fact, the soda fountain is the first thing you see when you walk in the door.
Up on the third floor, in the candy kitchen, candy makers are still at work.
During the Christmas season, thousands of candy canes are hand rolled on marble slabs and shipped all over the world.
Lucky, lucky Lebanon, Indiana.
A lot of small towns in Indiana can brag about a great diner or a state champ or two.
Lebanon has bragging rights to not one-but two-incredible chocolate makers.
David Alan Chocolatier truffle lovers' paradise.
The chocolate covered fruits and nuts are scrumptious, but it's the truffles that you'll talk about forever.
The classic truffles, in milk, dark, and white, and the trufflettes in orange, mocha, latte, raspberry, and gianduja-hazlenut, are "velvety-smooth."
You can try to describe them, but you'll soon realize there just aren't enough adjectives for "delectable."
Now, say you're passing through Lebanon on I-65 and suddenly, you can't go one more minute without some fabulous chocolate.
No problem.
Donaldson's Finer Chocolates (765.482.3334) is just a stone's throw off the highway (take the State Road 39 exit) and well worth the stop.
Or, you can plan ahead and call to set up a tour.
Group size is limited to 20-25 people; tours cover the history of the company and the making of the chocolate.
See the candy makers at work, and taste the "chocolate bark" that's made on marble slabs while you watch.
There are dozens of other treats you'll want to try, too.
There's grocery store-brand chocolate.
Then there's DeBrand chocolate.
At an age when most of us were biting candy pellets off elastic necklaces, Cathy Brand was learning the fine art of chocolate making.
At just eight years old, inspired by her family's expertise in confections, she started making chocolates-and has been perfecting her art ever since.
Over the years, Cathy Brand's world travels and research taught her much about making high quality, world-class chocolates.
In 1987, she opened her first shop, combining her last name with "De," the French prefix for "from."
Today, DeBrand chocolates are available at three chocolate cafes (Fort Wayne/North, 260.482.4373, Fort Wayne/Southwest, 260.432.5050, and Indianapolis/North, 317.466.1100) and through mail order (800.482.4373).
Chocolate and true love.
They just go together.
Were it not for Cupid's intervention, Union City might never have experienced the incredible creations available at Ghyslain Chocolatier, Inc. (866.449.7524).
Perhaps even more ironic: had Ghyslain Maurais followed his original plan to become an architect, he might never have made fine chocolates at all.
With three years of architecture school under his belt, the French Canadian born Maurais found his true calling while working his way through college in a restaurant.
Eventually, Maurais earned a diploma from the Institute d'Hotelerie et Tourisme of Quebec in Montreal, and become certified in French Pastry, Chocolate DÃ¯Â¿Â½cor and Candy Making, Blown and Pulled Sugar, and Bread-Making.
Several head chef positions (including for the Canadian Delegation in New York and London) lead him to a position as head chef at the Inn at Versailles in Ohio.
However, disillusioned with the community's reception to the latest trends in European cooking, he was considering moving back to Quebec when he met Susan Mathias, a restaurant patron.
The couple fell in love and married; Susan's position on the board of a family business mandated that they stay in the area.
This led them to open Ghyslain Chocolatier, Inc., makers of such high-end delights as chocolates filled with smooth ganache, fresh fruit purees, liqueurs and nuts.
Perhaps the most unique offerings are the signature hand-painted chocolates-a special technique using paint brushes and vibrant colors making each piece as spectacular to see as it is to taste.
Today, Ghyslain Chocolates are available at shops in several locations.
Shipping is also available.
Sweet, yet spicy.
What a combo.
With a soda fountain and an assortment of candies, Schimpff's Confectionery in Jeffersonville can satisfy just about any craving for something sweet.
Even the dÃ¯Â¿Â½cor-a tin ceiling and antiques-has a sweet, sentimental charm.
But how many candy makers can boast of a treat with a kick? The zippy cinnamon red-hots are a favorite of Schimpff's customers.
Evidently, the customers are happy; the family-owned business has been going strong for four generations.
There's something fishy going on here.
It's hard to determine what's most interesting about Mundt's Candies in Madison (812.265.6171).
Is it the fact that its founder, German immigrant Walter C. Mundt, also made the wedding cake for William Howard Taft, a personal friend? Is it the fact that the building where you find Mundt's is more than 165 years old? Is it that the candy making institution and soda fountain closed in 1966-only to reopen decades later in 1998? Or perhaps it's the fish.
For despite its colorful history, Mundt's is known mostly for the product it still makes today, fish-shaped candy.
Inspired by the "Little Fish Mixed Candy" introduced by Frederick Glass in the mid 1800s, Mundt joined the fish fun.
Back then, the candy was produced in cooler weather when it wouldn't stick together; the fish candy was also a holiday tradition.
Some speculate that the fish reflect the river's importance to Madison's commerce; others link it to the holiday season and the fish as a symbol of Christianity.
Today, the tasty fish candy is still made in the third-floor candy kitchen with much of the original equipment.
