Winter Contracts for Seven Murals
The Executive Committee met on August 22, 1930, to discuss the choice of a painter and sculptor to collaborate with Architect Hirons.
Hirons brought with him to the Vincennes meeting photographs and drawings illustrative of the work of muralists Eugene Savage arid Ezra Winter, and sculptors Charles Keck and Hermon A. MacNeil.
Among subjects proposed by those in attendance for murals were: Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and others sending George Rogers Clark to the West; scenes at Harrodsburg, Corn Island, Kaskaskia, and Cahokia; Clark and DeLeyba at St. Louis; Father Gibault administering the oath to the citizens of Vincennes; the attack on Fort Sackville; the surrender of Fort Sackville; the battle of Fallen Timbers; William Henry Harrison and Tecumseh at Vincennes; "Three Flag Day" at St. Louis on the occasion of the United States taking possession of the Louisiana Purchase; a scene from the Lewis and Clark expedition; a panorama representing the development of the Old Northwest; and an ornamental map of the Old Northwest.
Because of the divergence of opinion, action on the subject was deferred by the Committee.
[1]
At the September 17 meeting of the Executive Committee, it was determined that the "primary emphasis of the memorial and its paintings and sculpture be upon the winning of the Old Northwest, with individuals as decided upon."
Monsignor Gavisk moved that the Committee proceed to the selection of a painter and suggested that Ezra Winter be invited to meet with the group.
[2]
Ezra Winter Ezra Winter Artist and Muralist who completed the seven murals for the George Rogers Clark Memorial.
After two years the murals were complete and arrvived in Vincennes on November 30, 1934.
Winter met with the committee on October 2, and the group was impressed with the handsome 45-year-old Michigander.
A specialist in life-sized paintings, Winter maintained a studio in New York City, within easy commuting distance of his home in Canaan, Connecticut.
Before the day was over, Winter had a contract for preliminary work on seven murals.
[3]
On October 9 the Commission approved the action of its Executive Committee in engaging Winter for the mural paintings for the memorial.
He was to be paid $10,000 for his preliminary work to include "first and finished sketches of seven panels, each of them approximately" 15 by 26 feet, the final sketches to be submitted before March 1, 1931.
This sum would be deducted from the final fee for the murals, which was not to exceed $100,000.

The Scenes to be Depicted are Determined
The Executive Committee spent 90 minutes in Winter's Grand Central Station Studio on November 19, 1930.
Out of their discussions with the artist came a number of decisions.
It was determined that one of the panels would show Clark's march across the drowned lands and another the surrender of Fort Sackville, depicting, if possible, the church, the stockade, and the Wabash.
Above the murals there would be large medallions containing bas-reliefs of American leaders in the Revolution--Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Henry, Mason, and John Adams.
Between the portrait medallions were to be inscriptions.
A frieze of sculpture in relief was to encircle the rotunda under the murals.
A map of the Old Northwest was to be on the ceiling.
Three media--inscriptions, paintings, and sculpture--were to be employed to impress visitors with the "process by which the Old Northwest was won and occupied during the American Revolution, with the heroism and achievements of George Rogers Clark and his associates, and with the significance and importance of both of the foregoing."
[5]
When the Executive Committee returned to New York City on March 20, 1931, and visited Winter's studio, Monsignor Gavisk urged that the five remaining murals should depict: (a) Clark receiving his commission from Governor Patrick Henry; (b) Clark negotiating with the Indians at Cahokia; (c) the battle of Piqua; (d) the raising of the United States flag at St. Louis, with members of the Lewis and Clark expedition present; and (e) the westward movement.
In the upper part of each mural, there should be a relevant map.
At the request of Chairman Culbertson, Gavisk put his ideas in the form of a motion, and they were adopted.
[6]
Six months later, on September 21, the Executive Committee met with Winter at his New York City studio to examine and discuss the preliminary sketches.
It was decided that the maps be small cartouches at the top of each mural and not backgrounds, occupying the entire upper part of the paintings.
The subjects, except the one depicting the battle of Piqua, were approved, and Winter directed to proceed.
In place of the Piqua mural, Winter was requested to develop sketches representing the settlement of the Old Northwest, at Marietta, on the basis of the Ordinance of 1787.
[7]
Ezra Winter was in Vincennes on December 6.
He spent the day studying the Fort Sackville site, and took a number of photographs.
He paid particular attention to the trees to insure that he would paint them in their "February gauntness."
That evening at Culbertson's home, the artist showed a select group the three sets of drawings he had prepared for each of the seven murals.
Culbertson and his friends were impressed, and they agreed that selecting the best would be difficult.
Culbertson was especially impressed with the ones of the march across the drowned lands, and one could "fairly hear Clark shout to his men to come on, as he sweeps his gun aloft."
Winter told his audience of his intensive research for background materials.
On doing so, he had found the coat General Clark wore on his epic campaign in the John Marshall Museum in Richmond.
To insure accuracy, Winter had had photographs taken of the coat.
Culbertson, on hearing this exclaimed, "Vincennes should have that coat, it belongs to us."
[8]
On April 7, 1932, the Executive Committee again met with Winter, and, after examining his color sketches, determined on the subjects for the murals.
They were to be: (a) the Wilderness Road, (b) Clark Treating with the Indians at Cahokia, (c) the March on Vincennes, (d) the Attack on Fort Sackville, (e) the Surrender of Fort Sackville, (f) the Proclamation of the Northwest Ordinance at Marietta, and (g) Taking Possession for the United States of the Louisiana Territory at St. Louis.
[9] Culbertson at the April 26 meeting showed Winter's rendered sketches of the seven murals.
These sketches were approved, and Winter was directed to proceed with the execution of the contract.
[10]

Winter Completes the Murals
The Executive Committee on November 20 was in New York City and called at Winter's Grand Central Station Studio and inspected mock-ups of the murals.
They were approved subject to certain changes.
Among these were: in the Cahokia mural it was suggested that Father Gibault and Francis Vigo "might well be represented in the background"; in the march on Fort Sackville mural further study was to be made of some of the figures, especially the drummer boy, "and that an effort be made to bring out the hardships of the march, the exhaustion of the men and their desperate situation"; and in the St. Louis mural "Meriwether Lewis be made more conspicuous and that a trail leading to the Far Northwest be shown with pack horses on it."
[11]
At its meeting on March 31, 1933, the Executive Committee approved titles for six of the seven murals.
A number of titles were suggested for Mural No. 6, the one commemorating the Ordinance of 1787, but no agreement was reached.
Architect Hirons argued that he favored making the border at the top of the murals wider than the borders at the sides and bottoms, so as to harmonize with the capitals of the pilasters.
It was agreed to have Winter place at the tops of the murals a border corresponding to the height of the capitals of the pilasters, and that the borders of each panel carry the seals of two of the first 13 states, with the seal of the "Territory Northwest of the River Ohio" as the 14th seal.
Finally, the seal of the Continental Congress, or of the United States, was to be centered on the skylight.
[12]
The Committee on August 6 traveled to Falls Village, Connecticut, to where Winter had been compelled by the size of the murals to move his studio.
The group approved the murals, subject to a few minor corrections needed to insure accuracy.
It was determined to have Winter work into the borders a "design of oak leaf, sycamore leaf, pine cone, and pine needle . . . similar to the oak leaf border already done."
This border was to alternate with "ears of corn, etc."
Winter was urged to position the murals in the memorial as soon as possible.
[13]

Mounting the Murals
In the second week of November 1934, Winter notified the committee that he planned to reach Vincennes in two weeks with his works of art.
Preparatory for his arrival, Fred Steimel, a local contractor, positioned a high, mobile scaffold in the rotunda of the memorial.
[14] The murals reached the city on November 30 from the artist's Connecticut studio, but their arrival was kept secret until December 2, when Culbertson returned from Indianapolis and made a public announcement.
[15]
On Monday, the 3d, Winter detrained in Vincennes, and that night he showed his murals to a select group at the memorial.
Winter, aided by his assistant Joseph Smith, unrolled each of them on the floor and trimmed each to the proper size to fit the space on the wall where it was to be placed.
Each was then re-rolled ready for mounting.
The murals caused Culbertson and his friends to wax enthusiastic.
They were impressed by the more than 150 figures, with those in the foreground standing eight and one-half feet tall.
[16]
Winter and Smith turned a crew to preparing the murals for hanging.
The preliminary work saw them coating the wall with a backing consisting of a mixture of white lead and varnish to a depth of one-eighth inch.
This was then carefully smoothed, and the first canvas, "The Wilderness Road," carefully rolled onto the prepared surface.
The mixture, on drying, sealed the mural to the wall.
One ton of white lead was used before the seven canvases were secured.
[17]
Murals two and three were positioned by Thursday evening.
Although the structure was temporarily closed to visitors, members of the press given a sneak preview by Culbertson reported that these first murals changed "entirely the atmosphere of the memorial, transforming the coldness of the marble and stone, to a soft richness of beautiful blended colors."
[18]
The last of the seven murals was hung on Thursday, the 13th, one day ahead of schedule.
Contractor Steimel left the scaffolding in position until the end of the year to enable Winter and Smith to touch up the murals, to remove smudges that had appeared on them during handling, and to add certain "artistic touches of details intentionally omitted until after the paintings" were mounted to insure the best effects from lighting and the surroundings.
After the colors had dried, the murals were shellacked.
[19]
Senator Fess, chairman of the National Commission, reached Vincennes at noon on December 17, 1934, and accompanied by Dr. Coleman and Culbertson, inspected the murals.
Fess was delighted with what he saw, and, in accordance with the recommendation of the Executive Committee, Winter received his final payment for the seven murals.
