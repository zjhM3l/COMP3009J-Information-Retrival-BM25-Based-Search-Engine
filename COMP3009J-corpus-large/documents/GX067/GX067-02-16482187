Bureau home page 2002 NAICS Definitions 112 Animal Production [lineb3a.gif] 112 Animal Production Industries in the Animal Production subsector raise or fatten animals for the sale of animals or animal products.
The subsector comprises establishments, such as ranches, farms, and feedlots primarily engaged in keeping, grazing, breeding, or feeding animals.
These animals are kept for the products they produce or for eventual sale.
The animals are generally raised in various environments, from total confinement or captivity to feeding on an open range pasture.
The industries in this subsector are grouped by important factors, such as suitable grazing or pasture land, specialized buildings, type of equipment, and the amount and types of labor required.
Establishments are classified to the Animal Production subsector when animal production (i.e., value of animals for market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production.
Establishments with one-half or more animal production with no one animal product or family of animal products of an industry accounting for one-half of the establishment's agricultural production are treated as combination animal farming classified to Industry 11299, All Other Animal Production.
