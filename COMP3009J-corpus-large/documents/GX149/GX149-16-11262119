Draft Guidance for Constructed Treatment Wetlands Available for Public Comment
After nearly three years of effort, an interagency federal workgroup has published and released for comment Draft Guiding Principles for Constructed Treatment Wetlands: Providing Water Quality and Wildlife Habitat, which offers advice on building and operating wetlands to treat an array of wastewater discharges.
Produced by the Interagency Workgroup on Constructed Wetlands, the 39-page document offers guidance for locating, constructing, and operating constructed treatment wetlands designed to improve the water quality of discharges such as wastewater effluents and stormwater runoff while providing valuable wetland habitat.
Guiding Principles also outlines current policies, permit programs, regulations, and resources, and answers frequently asked questions regarding constructed treatment wetlands.
Guiding Principles addresses many of the policy and permitting issues associated with constructed treatment wetlands.
It summarizes technical and procedural information gathered by an interagency workgroup comprised of 42 members representing six agencies.
Experts from state and local agencies and academic institutions, shared their knowledge and experience with the group, who displayed an extraordinary level of cooperation in pooling their professional expertise to communicate the most important lessons, specifications, and policy considerations concerning constructed treatment wetlands.
Robert Bastian, one of the EPA Project Coordinators, noted that "establishing guidelines for the development of constructed wetlands will help make it possible to get developers, environmental interests, policy makers, and regulators all singing off the same song sheet.
Once involved parties clearly understand what the others are trying to do, they should be more amenable to supporting the creation of wetlands that not only polish wastewater effluents for downstream use, but also create high-value wetland habitat, including habitat for endangered species."
Designing and building wetlands to treat wastewater is hardly a new concept.
As many as 5,000 constructed wetlands have been built in Europe, with about a thousand already in operation in the United States.
Constructed treatment wetlands--in some cases involving the maintenance of valuable wetland habitat--have become particularly popular in the Southwest, where arid conditions make the wetland habitat supported by these projects an especially precious resource.
The usefulness of constructed wetlands is not limited to treating municipal wastewater and stormwater runoff; constructed wetlands are also being used across the nation to enhance the water quality of landfill leachates, a variety of industrial effluents, acid mine drainage, agricultural runoff, and wastewater from confined animal production operations.
In many cases, constructed wetlands have become an alternative to traditional advanced wastewater treatment systems.
Because constructed wetlands offer the possibility of creating new wetland habitat and other advantages in addition to treating wastewater, properly designed projects are earning a reputation as "win-win" projects that provide environmental benefits while reducing operating costs.
While the environmental gains of constructed treatment wetlands can be significant, there are also risks in building wetlands for wastewater treatment.
Potential adverse impacts include disrupting plant and animal communities, altering the hydrology of natural wetlands or other surface waters, introducing and spreading noxious species, and degrading downstream water quality and groundwater sources.
An important objective of the guidance is to help practitioners avoid environmentally harmful impacts by proper planning, design, construction, and operation of projects.
One constructed treatment wetlands success story is the Tres Rios Demonstration Project in Phoenix, Arizona.
In 1990, city managers in Phoenix needed to improve the municipal wastewater treatment plant to meet new water quality standards issued by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.
After learning that upgrading their 91^st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant might cost as much as $635 million, the managers began to look for a more cost-effective way to polish the treatment plant's wastewater discharge to the Salt River.

A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' preliminary feasibility study suggested that the city consider a constructed wetland system that would polish effluent, support high-quality wetland habitat for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds, including endangered species, and downstream residents from floods at a lower cost of than retrofitting their existing treatment plant.
As a result, the 12-acre Tres Rios Demonstration Project began in 1993 and now receives about two million gallons of effluent per day.
The city and the Bureau of Reclamation then asked EPA for help in dealing with the numerous policy and permitting issues associated with expanding the demonstration project to a full-scale, 800-acre project; this led to a 1995 project funded by EPA's Environmental Technology Initiative.
This project has yielded promising results.
During the past year, the Corps has begun investigating the feasibility of expanding the project to other parts of the greater Phoenix area.
As the number of constructed wetland projects grows, the Interagency Workgroup hopes that the guidance will become a reference source for an increasingly diverse range of professionals.
Preliminary public feedback on the recently published draft, Guiding Principles for Constructed Treatment Wetlands, shows that the guidance is occupying an important and previously unfilled niche in the field of constructed treatment wetlands.
The guidance is available for public comment through November 30, 1999.
Once comments have been received and addressed by the Workgroup, the guidance will be revised and issued in final form.

A Stormwater Solution That Works
A new stormwater treatment system is turning heads and drawing wildlife in Lansing, Michigan.
Thought to be the first of its kind in the world, the Tollgate Drainage District Wetland Detention Basin is designed to mimic a natural wetland ecosystem, complete with wetland ponds, waterfalls, spillways, a peat/sand filter, and spreading ditches.
The Tollgate system collects and treats runoff from 554 single-family homes in a 234-acre neighborhood and serves as a recreational and educational resource for community members.
Named after a tollgate on a road at the outlet of the drainage district during the late 1800s, the Tollgate Drainage District has served the residential portion of the Lansing Township with a combined sewer system since the 1940s.
Until recently, the nearby city of Lansing received and treated the combined sewage.
Because of frequent combined sewer overflows into the Red Cedar and Grand Rivers, the city was forced to mandate that the township separate its sewers.
Once the sewers were separated, the city would continue to accept sanitary sewage, but the township had to manage its own stormwater.
Faced with the extremely costly traditional means of treating or conveying stormwater, Patrick Lindemann, Ingham County Drain Commissioner, turned to a less traditional option -- a constructed wetland.
"Often stormwater is piped directly to the river and discharged.
We saved from $14 million to $17 million by not taking it to the river, and we are removing the nonpoint source pollutants from the stormwater."
The commissioner, based on input from the community, chose a 3,000-gallon-per-minute recirculating wetland system to collect and treat stormwater and sump pump water from the neighborhood.
It was built entirely on public land, part of which holds a municipal golf course.
The 35.8 acre-feet of storage built into the system can hold stormwater from up to a 100-year, 24-hour storm event; additional stormwater will overflow into the golf course's holding ponds that double as water hazards.
If necessary, 10 cubic feet per second of stored water can enter the city's treatment facility.
Community Involvement
As expected, the project initially generated community opposition, principally because the project would be paid for by a stormwater tax levied on the 554 homeowners.
But, because stormwater management was mandated, they had to select a management system.
To allay their concerns, the commissioner met with the public numerous times during the system selection stage, going door-to-door and meeting in groups.
Once citizens realized that the wetland system would cost just over $6 million, whereas other conventional alternatives could cost more than $20 million, they chose the wetland option.
After the wetland system was selected, the commissioner combined the design and construction of the system with a continued rigorous public outreach and education effort.
To simplify the educa- tion process, the neighborhood was divided into 11 districts that held numerous backyard barbeques, block parties, and living room meetings to inform homeowners about ways they could reduce their impact on stormwater and still maintain an attractive landscape.
At the meetings, Lindemann explained how by reducing nonpoint source pollution, homeowners would save money by decreasing the cost of maintaining (grit chamber clean-outs, pond dredging, etc.) the wetland system.
The commissioner intends to continue the public outreach process for another 10 to 15 years.
He has already planned multiple backyard barbeques for next summer, as well as neighborhood tours of the wetland system.
"Education can't happen overnight," he said.
"Eventually we hope to form a `Friends of the Tollgate Wetland' group that will carry on the education process."
The commissioner's staff also conducted frequent surveys of every household to assess response and understanding.
Not only did the surveys indicate when additional informational meetings were needed, they also helped identify community preferences.
"We found from our surveys that one-third of the residents walk two miles a day.
So, we built a Â½-mile trail around the system," explained Lindemann.
"The community loves it!"
The Wetland System
System Operation
Placed in an 11-acre park and on part of an adjoining golf course, the system is managed by the Ingham County Drain Commissioner using stormwater tax dollars.
Water is collected from residential areas by catch basins and transported
(1) by gravity through grit chambers, (2) over a limestone ledge to neutralize the water, (3) into the upper pond (11,500 ft2 and 5 ft deep), built to mimic a dead wood swamp, (4) through a 60-foot stream (6 to 12 inches deep) containing meanders and eddies that encourage evaporation, (5) into a second pond (10,120 ft2 and 4 ft deep) containing neutralizing limestone ledges and built bell-shaped to dissipate energy and collect sediment, (6) through a peat/sand filter (12,865 ft2 and 0.5 to 2 ft deep) to remove nutrients and pollutants, (7) into a spreading ditch (500 ft long by 2 ft wide) that removes sediment and encourages evaporation, (8) through a live hardwood swamp that also has native species (living trees, left in the existing swamp when the system was constructed, will die and create a deadwood swamp), (9) into three wetland pondshere water enters a pipe and is forced back up to the top of the system, and, (10) when water levels exceed wetland pond capacity, into holding ponds located on the adjacent golf course.
Maintenance Required
Little maintenance is anticipated for this seemingly complex system, with the exception of the following:
Pond biomass (cattails, etc.) will be harvested and composted annually.
Peat in the peat/sand filter will be replaced every few years.
Ponds will be dredged every 10 years.
Other Benefits
In addition to offering recreational opportunities, the now-complete system is an outdoor classroom.
"We see the system as a tool to teach pollution abatement.
Nonpoint source pollution is purely a function of social behavior--you really have to educate," remarked Lindemann.
The commissioner's staff provide site tours for schoolchildren, government officials, and citizens.
The commissioner's office also partners with community groups to develop curricula for local schools, build birdhouses, and post educational signs describing the treatment process and identifying the growing populations of wildlife and native plants.
The wetland system has also benefitted the community golf course.
One of the three ponds used for irrigation on the golf course is tied into the system.
Pond water nutrient levels are tested before irrigation and are taken into account in the overall fertilizer application budget.
This practice has reduced nutrient loading into the ponds and decreased golf course maintenance costs.
Although the system has been operating only since mid-1997, preliminary monitoring data indicate that, compared to untreated stormwater, the system has reduced suspended solids and pH and increased dissolved oxygen levels.
The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality recently awarded commissioner Lindemann a grant to monitor the nutrient removal effectiveness of the peat/sand filter.
In addition to protecting water quality, the treatment system provides a beautiful park with walking trails and wildlife habitat for the community to enjoy.
A forested island in the center of one of the ponds provides even more isolated wild- life habitat.
Moreover, community members have remained involved and informed during the whole construction process, gaining knowledge about nonpoint source pollution prevention that they can pass on to future generations.

Wetlands Health Assessments in Massachusetts
Historically, the success of national and state wetland policies has been largely measured by the trend in wetland acreage.
However, actions taken to stem losses and to recover wetlands may not be adequately protecting wetlands functions and values.
The Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management (MCZM) Program, the University of Massachusetts Cooperative Extension (UMass), and the Massachusetts Bays Program (MBP), have been working to develop a transferable approach to assess wetland quality or ecological health.
In a pilot project in Waquoit Bay watershed on Cape Cod, the trio designed a comprehensive evaluation, incorporating ecological indicators and rapid assessment procedures.
In the past year, the methods were successfully tested on study sites north of Boston where the geology and hydrology differed significantly from the coastal plain of Cape Cod.
This past summer, citizen volunteers monitored wetlands undergoing restoration as part of a longer term effort to encourage citizen stewardship and help develop a training module.
Measuring Ecological Indicators
Assessing a wetland includes measuring wetland vegetation, aquatic macroinvertebrates, avifauna, water chemistry, and hydroperiod.
For each ecological indicator, an index (or scoring mechanism) is used to combine a number of metrics (measurements, variables, and attributes) into a single rank or score.
Examples of the metrics include species diversity (or total number of species), community composition (such as the relative number of species representing certain families), and abundances of rare or pollution-tolerant species.
Fourteen test sites--seven freshwater and seven salt marsh wetlands in the Ipswich and North Coastal watersheds--were selected along a scale of human disturbance called the Land Use Index, which is a measure of perturbation at a specific site.
It includes both a field-based survey and a remote-sensing component.
The field survey takes into account readily identifiable impacts, such as storm drain discharges, eroding banks, runoff, or the presence of litter.
Test sites are compared with a wetlands reference site selected because it shows minimal signs of human disturbance, is in permanent conservation ownership, and belongs to a similar hydrogeomorphic wetland type.
Chemical and hydrological data are collected to help interpret the output scores.
The final output is a cumulative Wetland Ecological Integrity Score that combines the scores of all the measured ecological indicators into one quantitative rank.
Rapid Assessment
The rapid assessment procedures include separate evaluations for habitat quality, nonpoint source inputs from surrounding land use (as a measure of human land disturbance), and a measure of functions and values.
Distinct from field-based measurements, the rapid assessments rely on relatively simple observa-tions, existing information, simple calculations, and questions to evaluate habitat quality, nonpoint source contributions, and wetlands functions and values.
These methods can be applied quickly, easily, and inexpensively and complement the field-based indicators by gathering basic information on wetland and landscape conditions.
The field-based observations, along with the rapid assessments, can be combined into an overall measure of wetland ecological condition.
Wetland Program Development Grants Available
EPA's Wetland Program Development Grants are designed to assist state, tribal, and local government agencies in building their wetland management programs by helping them develop plans and management tools, advance the science and technical tools for protecting wetland health, facilitate the development of watershed stakeholder partnerships, and improve public access to wetland information.
Wetland Program Development Grants are applied for through EPA Regional Office staff who review the applications and select the most competitive projects for funding.
FY 2000 target deadline dates for initial proposals or pre-applications are as follows:
Region I December 1, 1999 Region II December 3, 1999 Region III October 4, 1999 Region IV October 30, 1999 Region V December 15, 1999 Region VI October 1, 1999 Region VII contact regional office at (913) 551-7320 Region VIII December 3, 1999 Region IX September 1, 1999 Region X October 15, 1999

Results
Results from the North Shore projects corroborate the findings of the pilot project on Cape Cod that with increasing human disturbance, the integrity of the biological communities declines, along with water quality and hydrology.
Shifts in plant and invertebrate community structure and indicator species richness and abundance were strongly associated with sources of nonpoint pollution, such as direct stormwater discharges and indirect septic system loads, and with direct physical habitat impacts, such as fill or hydrologic disturbance.
High concentrations of nutrients, total and dissolved solids, and fecal coliform bacteria were found in the wetlands receiving direct discharges of stormwater and groundwater from upland sources.
Functional and habitat assessment scores decreased as the intensity of nearby land uses increased.
Citizen Monitoring
Citizen volunteers were trained to conduct wetland health assessments this past summer at several wetlands recently restored by improving tidal flow.
Concurrent with citizen monitoring, program scientists collected data to validate the citizen effort and develop an easy-to-use-training manual for volunteers.
The citizen volunteers may have been the most innovative, as well as the most challenging part of the project, given their varying levels of experience in environmental monitoring and wetlands biology.
However, it was also one of the most rewarding aspects of the project; they were enthusiastic about learning the skill and many suggested how the assessments could be improved.
Measuring wetlands health is the next step in the evolution of regulatory protection for wetlands.
If a health assessment can show how wetland functions and values respond to permitted wetlands mitigation, it will assist with regulatory decision making.
Combining the rapid assessment with ecological indicators will improve understanding of the health of wetlands and how they are impacted.
By engaging citizens to monitor wetlands, the project partners hope to foster stewardship of wetlands and educate communities on the complicated issues surrounding wetlands.

League of Women Voters Knee Deep in the Crusade to Protect Wetlands
You might find members of the League of Women Voters marching on Capitol Hill or running a local voting booth, but who would think they could be found planting trees in a swamp? Many League members have been doing that and more, working hard at restoring and protecting local wetlands and getting their communities to help them.
Through a cooperative agreement with EPA's Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds, the League has completed 11 wetland-related restoration, protection, and education projects in 10 states.
Before beginning their wetland projects, the League trained its members on the functions and values of wetlands; on national policy regarding wetlands; and on community education and public involvement strategies.
The projects ranged from designing and conducting wetland workshops and tours to showing educational videos and putting together a traveling watershed model that included wetlands.
For example, a League chapter in Victoria, Texas, recognized a community need to include wetlands education in their schools' curricula.
They used a constructed wetlands education facility and organized and facilitated a training workshop for 45 administrators and science teachers from the Victoria Independent School District.
The Dupont-Victoria wetland education facility, a 50-acre wetland constructed as part of a $130 million environmental improvement program at DuPont Nylon's site in Victoria, provides a "polishing" component for a new wastewater treatment facility at the site and is used by the public as a wetland habitat and educational resource.
In a full day of activities, participants learned the value of wetlands and gained an understanding about the need for public education on wetlands.
Participants left with resource materials and other educational information to use in their classrooms.
As a result of the project, the Dupont-Victoria site coordinator estimates that 2,000 to 2,500 students will visit the site each year.
Many sessions have already been booked.
The project is jointly funded by the Dupont-Victoria facility and EPA.
In another project in Rochester, New York, the Natural Resources Committee of the Rochester Metro Area League used EnviroScapeÂ®, a portable watershed model developed by JT
They used the model in an outreach program that focuses on area youth.
The model has hills, a stream, a pond, animals, trees, houses, vehicles, and more.
They demonstrated the four basic functions of wetlands -- water absorption, water filtering, habitat, and recharge -- using sponges to simulate wetlands and cotton swabs to simulate cattails.
League members "treated" the landscape with fertilizer (green drink mix) and pesticides (red drink mix) and let the students use water bottles to simulate rain.
"The effect is very dramatic," says Natural Resources Committee Chairperson Jane Schmitt, "the sponges and cotton swabs change color as they absorb and remove some of the `fertilizer' and `pesticide' from the runoff."
They also used a miniature tractor and cocoa to simulate soil erosion.
The cocoa was sprinkled on the model's parking lots to demonstrate runoff from paved surfaces.
During the 1998 fall semester, League members presented the model to more than 1,100 children (grades 3-6) and adults, after school programs, Boy Scout Councils and Troops, environmental fairs, and at community events.
The presentation also includes one of Terrene Institute's videos, called Wake Up to Wetlands, to help participants understand the functions and values of wetlands in their community.
"Although it has been a lot of work, the project has been fun and we have gained new members as a result.
The children are very enthusiastic and really get involved in the presentation," remarked Schmitt.
The presentations continue to be scheduled with Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and at community events.
The Rochester Museum of Science and Technology has even borrowed the model for use in their environmental education programs.
These and are other wetlands projects undertaken by the League are summarized in the League's Wetland Web Walk web site at www.lwv.org/webwalk/index.html.
The League hopes that the summaries and lessons learned from these projects will help other watershed activity coordinators plan a successful wetland project in their community.
The web site also addresses common problems associated with small community projects, such as recognizing community needs; finding leaders, partners, and funding; and keeping the momentum going for the activity or product.
The League is currently working on a project with EPA's Office of Water to create a national network of active citizen leaders and trainers in the watershed approach and to develop a core curriculum for the trainers to use when they train others.
They also plan to distribute the curriculum to other organizations to increase the base of trained citizen leaders.
Through this project, dubbed the ECH[2]O Project, the League will encourage and facilitate the development of a

BP Amoco Puts Extra Land to Good Use
BP Amoco Chemical Company is working for wildlife, water quality, and community education at its Decatur, Alabama facility.
In the early 1990s, BP management decided to use a portion of its unused, undisturbed land for a community education and wildlife enhancement area.
They partnered with the Wildlife Habitat Council to improve habitat and develop a 1.3-mile nature trail through 10 acres of a wooded natural depression wetland.
The open-access nature trail gave BP Amoco employees and local citizens with the opportunity to observe bottomland and wetland flora and fauna up close.
To recognize BP Amoco's education and protection efforts, the Wildlife Habitat Council awarded the Decatur facility the 1997 Corporate Habitat of the Year award.
Enthused by the success of its first project, BP Amoco plans to expand its project area and scope.
"Our management wants to show the community that BP Amoco continues to be very concerned about protecting the environment" remarked Chris James, BP Amoco project manager.
Ultimately, BP Amoco hopes to improve the wetland area and trail and construct a learning center adjacent to the wetland area for the community.
Now, thanks to a $10,000 grant from EPA's Five Star Restoration Grant Program, BP Amoco is one step closer to its goals.
The Five Star Restoration Program provides grants, facilitates technology/information transfer and partner collaboration, and supports peer-to-peer communication programs in an effort to promote community-based wetland and riparian restoration projects.
The grant will allow BP Amoco and its partners to expand the wetland area by 25 percent, add additional nature trails, and replace undesirable plant species with beneficial plants.
BP Amoco's partners will serve key project implementation roles.
Wetland and habitat development will be led by experts from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Flintcreek Watershed Project, Tennessee Valley Authority, the Morgan County Soil and Water Conservation District, and the Wildlife Habitat Council.
Inmates at the Alabama Department of Corrections will provide manual labor.
A local contractor will supply supervisory and heavy equipment expertise.
Various student groups, including the City of Decatur Youth Services Corps, a local Boy Scout Troop, and a local elementary school, will conduct planting and other projects.
To support these efforts, BP Amoco personnel will direct the project as well as supply the balance of project funds.
[Bpfinal.gif]
The first portion of the project, expansion of the wetland, has recently begun with the construction of two gated berms across the drainage area.
The first, below the wooded natural depression wetland, will serve to raise the water level and expand the main wetland area.
The second berm is located upgradient below a separate wetland area that was historically drained for agriculture.
BP Amoco purchased the field in the early 1990s to restore it for wildlife.
With the berm in place, the field will become a seasonally flooded basin wetland.
The berm gate will remain open during the growing season to allow mixed grains, such as millet and buckwheat, to grow in the basin and to allow for waterfowl nesting.
At the end of each growing season the basin will be slowly filled at six- to eight-inch increments, forming a shallow landing and feeding pond for migratory waterfowl.
The basin will remained filled until the following growing season.
BP Amoco's expanded wetland project couldn't come at a better time.
The site is located at the base of a small watershed empties directly into the Tennessee River.
Recent construction in the large industrial park within the watershed is expected to decrease the quality and increase the quantity of stormwater runoff moving through BP Amoco's project site.
James sees BP Amoco's wetland project as a way to prevent nonpoint source pollution from reaching the river.
"We expect the stormwater flows to change down the road as construction of buildings and parking lots continues.
The expanded wetland will capture filter contaminated water."
To date, the current drought in the area has prevented marked stormwater flow changes.
The environmental commitment of BP Amoco's Decatur facility is as a model for other business landowners.
Through partnering efforts and voluntary improvements to previously unused land, BP Amoco is now educating the community about wetland areas, improving wildlife habitat, and increasing the filtering capacity of a wetland in a rapidly developing drainage area.
