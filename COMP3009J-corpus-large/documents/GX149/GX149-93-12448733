Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway
Rep. Mica is currently working, along with other members of the Florida Congressional Delegation, to ensure Congress provides adequate federal funds for maintenance dredging of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (ICW).
The operation and ongoing maintenance of the Waterway has been a federal responsibility since Congress approved the River and Harbor Act in 1927, but unfortunately the federal government has not provided the necessary full funding for the past several years.
The Intracoastal Waterway at Daytona Beach The Intracoastal Waterway at Daytona Beach The ICW is a critical part of Florida's eastern shore economy, and the Florida Legislature established the Florida Inland Navigation District (FIND) in 1927 to help the federal government provide regular maintenance.
The Waterway annually transports over 1 million tons of commercial cargo and over 500,000 recreational vessels; increases property values by $38.4 billion; and currently provides $7.9 billion in economic output which includes $2.6 billion in personal wages and almost 125,000 jobs.
Studies by FIND show that these benefits could be reduced in half if the ICW is not properly maintained.
Congress annually budgets approximately $3.2 million for work necessary to ensure the Intracoastal Waterway remains free of debris and sediment and continues to be safe for navigation.
Since 1998, however, local and State agencies have provided an additional $4.6 million per year to ensure proper maintenance of the ICW.
Around Ponce Inlet, approximately 10.6 miles of the Waterway's channel requires dredging to reeestablish the legally required depth of 12 feet and width of 125 feet.
Currently areas of the channel are as shallow as 3.9 feet.
With local and State support, the necessary federal funds will hopefully be provided by the end of this year so that the ICW can continue to serve as an important avenue of commerce and recreation.
