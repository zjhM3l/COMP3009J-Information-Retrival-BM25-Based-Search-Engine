The Quantum Mechanical Potential for the Prime Numbers
Author: G. Mussardo Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures Report-no: ISAS/EP/97/153, IC/97/199
A simple criterion is derived in order that a number sequence ${\cal S}_n$ is a permitted spectrum of a quantized system.
The sequence of the prime numbers fulfils the criterion and the corresponding one-dimensional quantum potential is explicitly computed in a semi-classical approximation.
The existence of such a potential implies that the primality testing can in principle be resolved by the sole use of physical laws.
