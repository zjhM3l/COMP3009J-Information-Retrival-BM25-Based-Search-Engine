Description
Brooks Range Supply, located in Prudhoe Bay, is an automotive parts retailer that operates a lead-acid battery recycling program.
It buys a majority of its goods--including lead acid batteries--from the National Auto Parts Association [NAPA].
Brooks Range Supply sells the batteries to oil contractors throughout the North Slope in Alaska, offering as part of its sales package a recycling and disposal service that complies with all applicable State and Federal regulations.
(A $4-$16 "core charge" is levied when a new battery is purchased without a spent battery brought for exchange; with an exchange, Brooks Range does not levy the core charge).
This successful recycling program involves several parties--Brooks Range, NAPA, Exide (the battery manufacturer), and the participating oil companies and contractors--each of which plays a distinct role.
Collection.
The spent batteries are delivered to Brooks Range Supply by the various customers.
Storage/Processing.
After the batteries are delivered, Brooks Range Supply palletizes, bands, and packages them for surface transport to Anchorage.
This transport is paid by Brooks Range Supply.
Shipping and Recycling.
From Anchorage, the batteries are barged by Exide (the manufacturer of the batteries) to Washington State for distribution to its smelters.
All shipping and recycling costs are covered by Exide.
Current Status of Recycling Project.
This project has been very successful.
Since its beginning in 1991, approximately 350 tons of batteries have been recycled.
Factors Important to Project's Success
Collaboration Mutually Benefits Exide, Brooks Range Supply, and Customer
All the involved parties benefit from this recycling program:
* The oil industry needs to manage its spent batteries in a safe, efficient manner; * Brooks Range is able to more effectively market its batteries by offering a recycling service; and * Exide is guaranteed a market of spent batteries for recycling.
Strong Participation of Oil Industry
The success of this project has been heightened by the involvement of oil companies, such as ARCO and BP:
* ARCO and BP supply spent batteries for the operation and also provide technical advice and occasional audits of the overall recycling process to ensure regulatory compliance.
* Because the oil contractors deliver their spent batteries to Brooks Range Supply, this saves the recycler the transportation costs associated with collection.
Revenues and Costs
Revenues and Other Benefits of Recycling
Revenues.
Brooks Range Supply does not make a profit, per se, from its recycling operations--and it is not their specified intention.
Rather, they mean for it to be a service that attracts potential clients, thereby generating increased revenues.
Brooks Range Supply personnel indicate that costs for disposal and recycling are built into the batteries' "core charge" (ranging from $4-$16), which is levied if a new battery is purchased without a spent battery exchange.
Benefits of Recycling.
Brooks Range Supply is inter- Funding Mechanisms.
This program is funded by ested providing a service that contributes to Brooks Range Supply which derives revenue from sell environmental protection.
To date, 350 tons of bat-ing automobile parts and batteries have been recycled.
Program Costs
Labor.
Brooks Range Supply spends approximately five hours per week preparing the collected batteries for transport to Anchorage.
Transport/Equipment/Capital Expenditures.
Brooks Range Supply sends one shipment of batteries per week to Anchorage (approximately two tons).
Again, the costs associated with this service are built into the upfront cost of the batteries.
Funding Mechanisms.
This program is funded by Brooks Range Supply, which derives revenue from selling automobile parts and batteries.
