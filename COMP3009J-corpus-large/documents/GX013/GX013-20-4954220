Article 702:International Obligations
1.
Annex 702.1 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex with respect to agricultural trade under certain agreements between them.
2.
Prior to adopting pursuant to an intergovernmental commodity agreement, a measure that may affect trade in an agricultural good between the Parties, the Party proposing to adopt the measure shall consult with the other Parties with a view to avoiding nullification or impairment of a concession granted by that Party in its Schedule to Annex 302.2 (Tariff Elimination).
3.
Annex 702.3 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex with respect to measures adopted or maintained pursuant to an intergovernmental coffee agreement.
Article 703:Market Access

2.
Annex 703.2 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex with respect to customs duties and quantitative restrictions, trade in sugar and syrup goods, and agricultural grading and marketing standards.
Special Safeguard Provisions
3.
Each Party may, in accordance with its Schedule to Annex 302.2, adopt or maintain a special safeguard in the form of a tariff rate quota on an agricultural good listed in its Section of Annex 703.3.
Notwithstanding Article 302.2, a Party may not apply an over-quota tariff rate under a special safeguard that exceeds the lesser of:
(a)the most-favored-nation (MFN) rate as of July 1, 1991; and (b)the prevailing MFN rate.
4.
No Party may, with respect to the same good and the same country, at the same time:
(a)apply an over-quota tariff rate under paragraph 3; and
(b)take an emergency action covered by Chapter Eight (Emergency Action).
Article 704: Domestic Support
The Parties recognize that domestic support measures can be of crucial importance to their agricultural sectors but may also have trade distorting and production effects and that domestic support reduction commitments may result from agricultural multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
Accordingly, where a Party supports its agricultural producers, that Party should endeavor to work toward domestic support measures that:
(a) have minimal or no trade distorting or production effects; or
(b)are exempt from any applicable domestic support reduction commitments that may be negotiated under the GATT.
The Parties further recognize that a Party may change its domestic support measures, including those that may be subject to reduction commitments, at the Party's discretion, subject to its rights and obligations under the GATT.
Article 705:Export Subsidies
1.
The Parties share the objective of the multilateral elimination of export subsidies for agricultural goods and shall cooperate in an effort to achieve an agreement under the GATT to eliminate those subsidies.
2.
The Parties recognize that export subsidies for agricultural goods may prejudice the interests of importing and exporting Parties and, in particular, may disrupt the markets of importing Parties.
Accordingly, in addition to the rights and obligations of the Parties specified in Annex 702.1, the Parties affirm that it is inappropriate for a Party to provide an export subsidy for an agricultural good exported to the territory of another Party where there are no other subsidized imports of that good into the territory of that other Party.
3.
Except as provided in Annex 702.1, where an exporting Party considers that a non-Party is exporting an agricultural good to the territory of another Party with the benefit of export subsidies, the importing Party shall, on written request of the exporting Party, consult with the exporting Party with a view to agreeing on specific measures that the importing Party may adopt to counter the effect of any such subsidized imports.
If the importing Party adopts the agreed-upon measures, the exporting Party shall refrain from applying, or immediately cease to apply, any export subsidy to exports of such good to the territory of the importing Party.
4.
Except as provided in Annex 702.1, an exporting Party shall deliver written notice to the importing Party at least three days, excluding weekends, prior to adopting an export subsidy measure on an agricultural good exported to the territory of another Party.
The exporting Party shall consult with the importing Party within 72 hours of receipt of the importing Party's written request, with a view to eliminating the subsidy or minimizing any adverse impact on the market of the importing Party for that good.
The importing Party shall, when requesting consultations with the exporting Party, at the same time, deliver written notice to a third Party of the request.
A third Party may request to participate in such consultations.
5.
Each Party shall take into account the interests of the other Parties in the use of any export subsidy on an agricultural good, recognizing that such subsidies may have prejudicial effects on the interests of the other Parties.
6.
The Parties hereby establish a Working Group on Agricultural Subsidies, comprising representatives of each Party, which shall meet at least semi-annually or as the Parties may otherwise agree, to work toward elimination of all export subsidies affecting agricultural trade between the Parties.
The functions of the Working Group shall include:
(a)monitoring the volume and price of imports into the territory of any Party of agricultural goods that have benefitted from export subsidies;
(b)providing a forum for the Parties to develop mutually acceptable criteria and procedures for reaching agreement on the limitation or elimination of export subsidies for imports of agricultural goods into the territories of the Parties; and
(c)reporting annually to the Committee on Agricultural Trade, established under Article 706, on the implementation of this Article.
7.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article:
(a)if the importing and exporting Parties agree to an export subsidy for an agricultural good exported to the territory of the importing Party, the exporting Party or Parties may adopt or maintain such subsidy; and (b)each Party retains its rights to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports of agricultural goods from the territory of a Party or non-Party.
Article 706:Committee on Agricultural Trade
1.
The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Agricultural Trade, comprising representatives of each Party.
2.
The Committee's functions shall include:
(a)monitoring and promoting cooperation on the implementation and administration of this Section; (b)providing a forum for the Parties to consult on issues related to this Section at least semi-annually and as the Parties may otherwise agree; and (c)reporting annually to the Commission on the implementation of this Section.
Article 707:Advisory Committee on Private Commercial Disputes regarding Agricultural Goods
The Committee shall establish an Advisory Committee on Private Commercial Disputes regarding Agricultural Goods, comprising persons with expertise or experience in the resolution of private commercial disputes in agricultural trade.

(a)increased by the amount, if any, by which the actual net production surplus exceeds the projected net production surplus in the most recent marketing year for which the Parties projected a net production surplus for that Party; or (b)decreased by the amount, if any, by which the projected net production surplus exceeds the actual net production surplus in the most recent marketing year for which the Parties projected a net production surplus for that Party;
as further demonstrated by the following formulas:
ANPS = (PPy - CPy) + CF
where:ANPS =adjusted net production surplus
PP = projected domestic production of sugar
CP = projected total consumption of sugar
CF = correction factor
y = next marketing year,
and
CF = (PAys - CAys) - (PPys - CPys)
where:PA = actual domestic production of sugar
CA = actual total consumption of sugar
ys = most recent previous marketing year for which the Parties projected a net production surplus for that Party.
2.
For purposes only of paragraph 1, neither the projected net production surplus (PPys -CPys) nor the actual net production surplus (PAys - CAys) in the most recent marketing year for which the Parties projected a net production surplus for that Party may be considered to:
(a)exceed the quantity, if any, in Section A(15) applicable to that year; or (b)be lower than the greater of
(i) 7,258 metric tons raw value, or (ii) the quantity in paragraph 14(b) of Section A applicable to that year.
3.
In appropriate circumstances, a Party shall consider adjustments to projections of its net production surplus when:
Fc greater than (B + 10 %)
where
F is the percentage change in stocks from the beginning to the end of a marketing year z, expressed as a positive percentage
c is current marketing year
F is calculated in accordance with the following formula:
?????Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sb - Se Ã¯Â¿Â½
F =?Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã„Â´ x 100
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sb Ã¯Â¿Â½
Sb beginning stocks in marketing year z
Se ending stocks in marketing year z
B the average annual percentage change in stocks over the previous 5 marketing years, calculated in accordance with the following formula:
N previous marketing years, ranging from 1 (first preceding year) to 5 (fifth preceding year).
4.
For purposes of determining net production surplus or projected net production surplus:
(a)domestic production means all sugar and syrup goods derived from sugar cane or sugar beets grown in a Party's territory; and (b)total consumption means all sugar and syrup goods consumed directly, or indirectly in the form of a good containing such goods, in the territory of a Party.
5.
Each Party shall permit representatives from the other Party to observe and comment on its statistics on production, consumption, trade and stocks and on the methodology it uses to prepare such statistics.
6.
Statistics on production, consumption, trade and stocks shall be provided by:
(a)the SecretarÃ¯Â¿Â½a de Agricultura y Recursos HidrÃ¯Â¿Â½ulicos, the SecretarÃ¯Â¿Â½a de Comercio y Fomento Industrial, and the SecretarÃ¯Â¿Â½a de Hacienda y CrÃ¯Â¿Â½dito PÃ¯Â¿Â½blico; and (b)the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Section B - Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures
Article 709:Scope and Coverage
In order to establish a framework of rules and disciplines to guide the development, adoption and enforcement of sanitary and phytosanitary measures, this Section applies to any such measure of a Party that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade between the Parties.
Article 710:Relation to Other Chapters
Articles 301 (National Treatment) and 309 (Import and Export Restrictions), and the provisions of Article XX(b) of the GATT as incorporated into Article 2101(1) (General Exceptions), do not apply to any sanitary or phytosanitary measure.
Article 711:Reliance on Non-Governmental Entities
Each Party shall ensure that any non-governmental entity on which it relies in applying a sanitary or phytosanitary measure acts in a manner consistent with this Section.
Article 712:Basic Rights and Obligations
Right to Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Right to Establish Level of Protection Scientific Principles Non-Discrimatory Treatment Unnecessary Obstacles Disguised Restrictions
Right to Take Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures
1.
Each Party may, in accordance with this Section, adopt, maintain or apply any sanitary or phytosanitary measure necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health in its territory, including a measure more stringent than an international standard, guideline or recommendation.
Right to Establish Level of Protection
2.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, each Party may, in protecting human, animal or plant life or health, establish its appropriate levels of protection in accordance with Article 715.
Scientific Principles
3.
Each Party shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary measure that it adopts, maintains or applies is:
(a)based on scientific principles, taking into account relevant factors including, where appropriate, different geographic conditions; (b)not maintained where there is no longer a scientific basis for it; and (c)based on a risk assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances.
Non-Discriminatory Treatment
4.
Each Party shall ensure that a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that it adopts, maintains or applies does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between its goods and like goods of another Party, or between goods of another Party and like goods of any other country, where identical or similar conditions prevail.
Unnecessary Obstacles
5.
Each Party shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary measure that it adopts, maintains or applies is applied only to the extent necessary to achieve its appropriate level of protection, taking into account technical and economic feasibility.
Disguised Restrictions
6.
No Party may adopt, maintain or apply any sanitary or phytosanitary measure with a view to, or with the effect of, creating a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.
Article 713:International Standards and Standardizing Organizations
1.
Without reducing the level of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, each Party shall use, as a basis for its sanitary and phytosanitary measures, relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations with the objective, among others, of making its sanitary and phytosanitary measures equivalent or, where appropriate, identical to those of the other Parties.
2.
A Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure that conforms to a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 712.
A measure that results in a level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection different from that which would be achieved by a measure based on a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation shall not for that reason alone be presumed to be inconsistent with this Section.
3.
Nothing in Paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or applying, in accordance with the other provisions of this Section, a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that is more stringent than the relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation.
4.
Where a Party has reason to believe that a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of another Party is adversely affecting or may adversely affect its exports and the measure is not based on a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation, it may request, and the other Party shall provide in writing, the reasons for the measure.
5.
Each Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable, participate in relevant international and North American standardizing organizations, including the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the International Office of Epizootics, the International Plant Protection Convention, and the North American Plant Protection Organization, with a view to promoting the development and periodic review of international standards, guidelines and recommendations.
Article 714:Equivalence
1.
Without reducing the level of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable and in accordance with this Section, pursue equivalence of their respective sanitary and phytosanitary measures.
2.
Each importing Party:
(a)shall treat a sanitary or phytosanitary measure adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, provides to the importing Party scientific evidence or other information, in accordance with risk assessment methodologies agreed on by those Parties, to demonstrate objectively, subject to subparagraph (b), that the exporting Party's measure achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of protection; (b)may, where it has a scientific basis, determine that the exporting Party's measure does not achieve the importing Party's appropriate level of protection; and (c)shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for a determination under subparagraph (b).
3.
For purposes of establishing equivalence, each exporting Party shall, on the request of an importing Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures.
4.
Each Party should, in the development of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, consider relevant actual or proposed sanitary or phytosanitary measures of the other Parties.
Article 715: Risk Assessment and Appropriate Level of Protection
1.
In conducting a risk assessment, each Party shall take into account:
(a)relevant risk assessment techniques and methodologies developed by international or North American standardizing organizations; (b)relevant scientific evidence; (c)relevant processes and production methods; (d)relevant inspection, sampling and testing methods; (e)the prevalence of relevant diseases or pests, including the existence of pest-free or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence; (f)relevant ecological and other environmental conditions; and (g)relevant treatments, such as quarantines.
2.
Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall, in establishing its appropriate level of protection regarding the risk associated with the introduction, establishment or spread of an animal or plant pest or disease, and in assessing the risk, also take into account the following economic factors, where relevant:
(a)loss of production or sales that may result from the pest or disease; (b)costs of control or eradication of the pest or disease in its territory; and (c)the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches to limiting risks.
3.
Each Party, in establishing its appropriate level of protection:
(a)should take into account the objective of minimizing negative trade effects; and (b)shall, with the objective of achieving consistency in such levels, avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in such levels in different circumstances, where such distinctions result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against a good of another Party or constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.
4.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (3) and Article 712(3)(c), where a Party conducting a risk assessment determines that available relevant scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional sanitary or phytosanitary measure on the basis of available relevant information, including from international or North American standardizing organizations and from sanitary or phytosanitary measures of other Parties.
The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional measure in the light of the assessment.
5.
Where a Party is able to achieve its appropriate level of protection through the phased application of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, it may, on the request of another Party and in accordance with this Section, allow for such a phased application, or grant specified exceptions for limited periods from the measure, taking into account the requesting Party's export interests.
Article 716: Adaptation to Regional Conditions
1.
Each Party shall adapt any of its sanitary or phytosanitary measures relating to the introduction, establishment or spread of an animal or plant pest or disease, to the sanitary or phytosanitary characteristics of the area where a good subject to such a measure is produced and the area in its territory to which the good is destined, taking into account any relevant conditions, including those relating to transportation and handling, between those areas.
In assessing such characteristics of an area, including whether an area is, and is likely to remain, a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest or disease prevalence, each Party shall take into account, among other factors:
(a)the prevalence of relevant pests or diseases in that area; (b)the existence of eradication or control programs in that area; and (c)any relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation.
2.
Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall, in determining whether an area is a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest or disease prevalence, base its determination on factors such as geography, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance and the effectiveness of sanitary or phytosanitary controls in that area.
3.
Each importing Party shall recognize that an area in the territory of the exporting Party is, and is likely to remain, a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest or disease prevalence, where the exporting Party provides to the importing Party scientific evidence or other information sufficient to so demonstrate to the satisfaction of the importing Party.
For this purpose, each exporting Party shall provide reasonable access in its territory to the importing Party for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures.
4.
Each Party may, in accordance with this Section:
(a)adopt, maintain or apply a different risk assessment procedure for a pest-free or disease-free area than for an area of low pest or disease prevalence, or (b)make a different final determination for the disposition of a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area than for a good produced in an area of low pest or disease prevalence,
taking into account any relevant conditions, including those relating to transportation and handling.
5.
Each Party shall, in adopting, maintaining or applying a sanitary or phytosanitary measure relating to the introduction, establishment or spread of an animal or plant pest or disease, accord a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area in the territory of another Party no less favorable treatment than it accords a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area, in another country, that poses the same level of risk.

6.
Each importing Party shall pursue an agreement with an exporting Party, on request, on specific requirements the fulfillment of which allows a good produced in an area of low pest or disease prevalence in the territory of an exporting Party to be imported into the territory of the importing Party and achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of protection.
Article 717: Control, Inspection and Approval Procedures
