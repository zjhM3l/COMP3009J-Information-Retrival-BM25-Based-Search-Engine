ULTRAWIDEBAND-TO-GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE SCENARIOS Introduction This document is intended to describe the scenarios to be used in the evaluation of potential interference to the Global Positioning System (GPS) from Ultrawideband (UWB) transmission systems.
The results of this scenario study will be used in conjunction with results from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Measurement Plan to Determine the Potential Interference Impact to Global Positioning System Receivers From Ultrawideband Transmission Systems in responding to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
Construction of Link Budget
This scenario study will apply data collected during the NTIA measurement program.
This data consists of the level of UWB signal power (within the GPS band) that can be tolerated without causing harmful interference.
The data will be input to a link budget, which will take into account GPS antenna gain and propagation loss based upon a minimum separation distance between the GPS receiver and the UWB transmitter or transmitters if an aggregate scenario is being considered.
The end result of this link budget will be an Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) which can be radiated by an UWB transmission system without causing harmful interference to GPS.
The link budget will be based upon the following equation:
I = (P[T] + G[T]
where,
I = Interference Threshold Level Referenced to the GPS Receiver Input In dBm/20 MHz P[T] = UWB Transmitter Power centered on 1575.42 MHz in dBm/20 MHz G[T]
P[T] + G[T]
It should be noted that G[R] will depend on the locations of the GPS receiver and the UWB transmission system, which will not always be within the main beam of the GPS antenna.
The position of the two systems will be accounted for in the scenario development and G[R] will be adjusted accordingly.
In addition to those parameters listed above, other scenario dependent factors such as antenna shielding, wall attenuation (for indoor UWB applications) and aeronautical safety margins may be present in the link budget calculation.
Sources of Parameters
The values to be used in calculation of the link budget will be gathered from various sources.
I will be obtained from the NTIA GPS measurement program.
This number will be the average power measured for the applicable UWB parameters in a 20-MHz bandpass filter centered on 1575.42 MHz.
P[T] + G[T]
This is the ultimate number sought by this scenario study.
G[R] is estimated based on typical GPS antennas, and the relative positions of the UWB transmitter and the GPS receiver.
L[P] is calculated using the free space propagation loss equation shown below.
using and gives:
(dB)
where d is the minimum separation distance in meters.
The minimum separation distance used in the calculation of the path loss will be determined from the particular scenario parameters.
Determination of GPS Antenna Gain
The GPS antenna gain (G[R]) to be used in the calculation of the link budget will be based upon the relative locations of the UWB transmitter and the GPS antenna.
Figure 1 illustrates the value to be used for G[R], dependent upon the particular scenario.
Identification of UWB and GPS Applications
The objective of this task is to identify applications for GPS, and also applications for UWB technology.
These applications will allow scenarios to be developed in order to assess the potential for harmful interference from UWB transmission systems.
