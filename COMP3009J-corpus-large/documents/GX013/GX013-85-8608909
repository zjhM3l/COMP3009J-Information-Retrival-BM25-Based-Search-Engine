Steve Logue, managing director of the resort, said, "The West Virginia Day weekend provides us all with a good reason to get out and celebrate our state's history and heritage, and Canaan Valley Resort is pleased to be a part of that."
The Barbour Grays, a civil war reenactment group based in Philippi, will camp out near the Nature Center at Canaan Valley State Park Friday evening through Sunday afternoon.
Visitors will be able to tour civil war encampments, view soldiers in their camps set up for cooking and sleeping, and witness a skirmish demonstration (Saturday 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., Sunday noon) complete with cannon and gun display.
Ron Schoonover, a member of the Barbour Grays, said, "Our 20-30 person group will provide a living history of civil war life through our campsite and battle reenactments."
Logue noted that an arts and crafts fair will also take place this weekend at the resort.
Skillfully created Appalachian products will be on sale and displayed behind the main lodge all day on Saturday.
Guests can also hike, mountain bike or play the resort's 18-hole championship golf course (tee time required).
Ski chairlift rides are also available all day Saturday and Sunday at the ski area.
