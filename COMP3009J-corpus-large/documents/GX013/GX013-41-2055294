Written Findings of the State Noxious Weed Control Board - Class A weed _________________________________________________________________ Kudzu (Pueraria lobata) amily: Leguminosae (Fabaceae) Legal Status: WSDA Quarantined Plant Proposed as a Class A Weed for Washington States 2003 Noxious Weed list [Image15.gif] _________________________________________________________________ Description and Variation: Kudzu is a perennial, trailing or climbing vine which may expand 60 feet or more in a year from root crowns which become enlarged with age.
A single root crown may produce as many as 30 vines which become somewhat hairy and woody and expand out in all directions.
Fleshy tap roots develop from the crown and may be up to 7" in diameter and 6 feet or more in length.
Vines which develop from the root crown are also able to root at the nodes forming additional root crowns.
Mature infestations of this aggressive member of the legume family may develop root crowns every one to two square feet from which new vines are rapidly produced (Moorhead and Johnson, 2000).
Rhizomes are also produced and increase vegetative reproduction.
Kudzu is deciduous losing its leaves in the fall usually following a killing frost.
Leaves are alternate and compound with three oval to nearly heart-shaped leaftlets each three to four inches long.
Leaflets are dark green and may be entire or slightly lobed.
Leaves and stems are hairy.
Dense stands of Kudzu are characterized by thousands of single-colored plants covering everything in their range.
[pulo_1v.jpg] Fragrant purple flowers are clustered in axillary racemes up to one foot long.
Each floret is pea-like, Ã¯Â¿Â½ to Ã¯Â¿Â½" and may be purple or purplish-red.
The fragrance is described as grape-like.
Flowers are rarely produced in open patches on flat ground but do form in mid-summer on vines draped over trees, fences or other objects.
Kudzu fruits produced in the fall are hairy, flattened leguminous pods.
Each pod bears only a few hard-coated seeds which may remain dormant and viable for several years before they germinate.

Economic Importance :
Beneficial:
Prescribed burning will also promote seed germination for removal or treatment.
Mowing and/orCutting:
Making light of more than 7 million infested acres in the eastern United States a small cottage industry has developed around this plant including the sale of kudzu baskets, novelties, and an annual Kudzu Festival in Blythewood, Georgia.
Culinary and herbal uses exist from Japanese and Chinese tradition.
Kudzu has been used for reducing hypertension and is being studied for alcoholism (reduces craving).
Detrimental: Kudzu is a highly aggressive invasive plant which is extremely difficult to control once established.
According to researchers at Clemson University, lands infested with Kudzu are generally good for only one purpose growing Kudzu.
Kudzu is so aggressive it covers and smothers all other plants in its path resulting in solid single species stands eliminating native species and natural diversity.
Trees may be covered with kudzu and damaged by the weight of the vegetation resulting in loss of limbs or tree death from insufficient light necessary for photosynthesis.
Once established, Kudzu can render lands unusable for timber production or agriculture.
The Congressional Office of Technology estimated the economic costs of Kudzu at $50 million annually (Hoots and Stewart, 1997).
Control costs are estimated to increase by $6 million per year (Agricultural Research Service) as landowners struggle to contain this plant.
The weight of the vines can bring down power lines and collapse buildings.
Geographic Distribution:
Kudzu is native to Japan and was introduced into the United States in 1876.
Distribution within the United States extends from Connecticut to Missouri and Oklahoma, south to Texas and Florida (USDA Plants Database, 2000).
There are three confirmed sites in the Portland metropolitan area of Oregon (Butler, 2001) and one recently discovered site in Clark County, Washington
(Hendrickson, 2001) [plant.tif.jpg] Washington Site: Four plants covering less than 1000 feet were discovered on private property in Vancouver, Washington (Clark County).
Property is adjacent to a forested site owned by Bonneville Power Administration, Ross Complex (Hendrickson, 2001).
Location details are with the Clark County Noxious Weed Control Board and the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board.
Habitat: Kudzu grows best in well-drained degraded or eroded land or in disturbed, sandy, deep-loam soils in full sun.
It will, however, invade well-drained acid-soil forests.
It does not grow well or at all in wet bottomlands or in thin hard-pan soils.
It will not establish healthy grass cover, but may spread into such areas by running vines.
(U.S. Department of Agriculture Cooperative Extension, MS) Kudzu can persist on the floor of a closed canopy forest (Southeast Exotic Pest Plant Council, 2001).
History:
Kudzu was introduced in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where it was used in a Japanese government display garden.
It was planted widely as an ornamental vine for its abundant vegetation and sweet-smelling flowers.
In the 1920s it was promoted as a forage plant and by the 1930s the Soil Conservation Service encouraged landowners to plant it for erosion control.
The Civilian Conservation Corps planted it and farmers were paid as much as $8.00 per acre to plant fields of the vine in the 1930s and 1940s.
Kudzu Clubs were established during the 1940s to honor "the miracle vine".
Not until the 1950s did the U.S. government cease advocating the use of this plant.
In 1970 the USDA declared kudzu a noxious weed and in 1997 kudzu is made a federal noxious weed.
[root.tif.jpg] Washington site history: Kudzu infestation first brought to the attention of the Clark County Noxious Weed Control Board in September 2001.
Four plants covering 1,000 feet were located.
Vines were removed by hand and bagged.
Four root crowns located were treated with Garlon 4 undiluted to each cut stem at the root crown.
Treated root crowns were marked with stakes to aid in future location.
Bagged vegetation was sent to a landfill.
Adjacent property was surveyed for additional plants but none were found.
(Additional details: Clark County and State Noxious Weed Control Board files)
Growth and Development: Kudzu is a perennial vine which may grow up to one foot a day.
These vines may grow as long as 98 feet (Southeast Exotic Pest Plant Council, 2001).
Vegetative growth is from fleshy root crowns which produce vines and rhizomes which root at the nodes and form additional root crowns.
Each root crown produces an extensive tap root that stores large reserves of starch which provides for the long-term survival of this plant.
Flowers are produced mid to late-summer on upward climbing or draping vines but are not known to occur on prostrate ground-hugging vines (Moorhead and Johnson, 2000).
Kudzu plants do not usually flower until the third year (Southeast Exotic Pest Plant Council, 2001).
Seeds are produced in flattened hairy pods that contain only a few viable seeds.
Viable seeds are thought to be responsible for most long-distance migration (Miller, 1997; Missouri Dept.
Conservation Fact Sheet).
Reproduction: Reproduction by seed is believed to be minimal (Southeast Exotic Pest Plant Council, 2001).
Burning scarifies the hard seed coat and will promote germination (Moorhead and Johnson, 2000).
Most reproduction is asexual vegetative reproduction of vines which root at the nodes and rhizomes.
The characteristic aggressive growth of vines which can root at every node results in extensive plant coverage within one year.
Control Methods: Control of well established kudzu stands can take up to 10 years.
Persistent treatment of patches is they only true control measure.
Response to Mechanical Control Methods : Mechanical control methods require enormous persistence since the goal is to deplete the rootstocks of stored food and prevent replenishment through the photosynthesis of above ground vegetation.
Any successful mechanical control method will require consistent and persistent removal of above ground vegetation.
It may take as much as ten years to deplete the food reserves of the starchy rootstocks (Moorhead and Johnson, 2000).
Grazing: Kudzu is palatable and may be grazed.
Sites must be fenced and livestock rotated.
Repeated grazing over many successive years is required to adequately deplete starch reserves and kill the plant.
Not recommended for new infestations.
Burning:
Prescribed burning is used on old extensive infestations to remove vegetative cover, usually in preparation for treatment of the root crowns.
Prescribed burning will also promote seed germination for removal or treatment.
Mowing and/orCutting:
Repeated mowing can weaken and ultimately control Kudzu but persistence is essential.
Response to Herbicides :
There are multiple methods for chemical control of Kudzu.
Persistent eradication of all roots is the key to controlling kudzu systemic herbicides will give the best effects.
Miller et al. studied the effects of numerous chemicals over an eight-year period.
Out of twenty five herbicides, Tordon 101 Mixture (2,4-D +picloram) and Tordon K(picloram liquid) were the most cost-effective treatments.
Cut Stump Method:
Use this method in areas where vines are established within or around non-target plants or where vines have grown into the canopy.
Cut the stem 5 cm (2 in) above ground level.
Immediately apply a 25% solution of triclopyr or glyphosate and water to the cross-section of the stem.
This procedure remains effective at low temperatures as long as the ground is not frozen.
A subsequent foliar application may be necessary to control new seedlings.
Foliar Spray Method: T
his method could be used to control large populations.
It may be neces-sary to precede foliar applications with stump treatments to reduce the risk of dam-aging non-target species.
After the stems and leaves have been brought under control (i.e., all above ground portions of the plants have been effectively treated) further treatment should follow the Root Crown Method.
Apply a 2% concentration of triclopyr or glyphosate and water to thoroughly wet all foliage.
Do not apply so heavily that herbicide will drip off leaves.
A 0.5% concentration of a non-ionic surfactant is recommended in order to penetrate leaf cuticle.
Ambient air temperature should be above 65Ã¯Â¿Â½F.
Root Crown Method:
Follow the young or resprouting stem of the plant to the root.
Dig and cut into the root crown using a pulaski or similar tool.
Apply a 50% glyphosate solution or 50% triclopyr solution to the main root crown and any below ground runners.
Make Sure to Read all Labels before using any pesticides.

Biocontrol Potentials :
Researchers at the ARS Southern Weed Science Research Unit in Stoneville, Mississippi have found a fungus from the sicklepod plant found in the southeastern United States controls kudzu.
In greenhouse and field studies Kudzu was 100 percent killed by Myrothecium verrucaria.
Researchers plan to pursue a patent on this use.

Grazing: Kudzu can produce forage which is noted to be palatable to livestock.
The carrying capacity of kudzu is thought to be about 1 cow per acre.
Studies found that goats might offer a viable alternative chemical control of kudzu.
