DECISION AND ORDER
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUED HIS DECISION AND ORDER IN THE ABOVE-ENTITLED PROCEEDING, FINDING THAT THE RESPONDENT HAD ENGAGED IN THE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT, AND RECOMMENDING THAT IT CEASE AND DESIST THEREFROM AND TAKE CERTAIN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AS SET FORTH IN THE ATTACHED JUDGE'S DECISION AND ORDER.
THEREAFTER THE RESPONDENT FILED EXCEPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE JUDGE'S DECISION AND ORDER.
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS (5 CFR 2423.29) AND SECTION 7118 OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE (STATUTE), THE AUTHORITY HAS REVIEWED THE RULINGS OF THE JUDGE MADE AT THE HEARING AND FINDS THAT NO PREJUDICIAL ERROR WAS COMMITTED.
THE RULINGS ARE HEREBY AFFIRMED.
UPON CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGE'S DECISION AND ORDER AND THE ENTIRE RECORD IN THE CASE, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ADOPTS THE JUDGE'S FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
IN ADOPTING THE JUDGE'S FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS, THE AUTHORITY AGREES THAT A WAIVER WILL BE FOUND ONLY IF IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE CLEARLY AND UNMISTAKABLY WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE.
/1/ THE AUTHORITY FURTHER AGREES THAT NO SUCH CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE WAIVER IS PRESENT IN THIS CASE.
MOREOVER, THE AUTHORITY NOTES THAT THE JUDGE FOUND THAT THE DISPUTED "STAY OF ACTION" PROPOSAL WAS, "IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, IDENTICAL TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE UNION'S PROPOSAL" IN AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO, LOCAL 1999 AND ARMY-AIR FORCE EXCHANGE SERVICE, DIX-MCGUIRE EXCHANGE, FORT DIX, NEW JERSEY, 2 FLRA NO. 16(1979), ENFORCED SUB NOM.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE V. FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY, . . .
F.2D . . .
(D.C.
CIR. NO. 80-1119, JULY 2, 1981).
HE THEN REASONED THAT " . . .
AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE WILL BE FOUND EVEN WHERE THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE PRIOR NEGOTIABILITY CASE WERE DIFFERENT AS LONG AS "'NO MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES'" CAN BE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO PROPOSALS."
/2/ THE AUTHORITY AGREES THAT ONCE A PROPOSAL HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE NEGOTIABLE THROUGH THE PROCESSES OF THE STATUTE, IT IS A VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(5) OF THE STATUTE FOR ANY AGENCY TO REFUSE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH ON THAT PROPOSAL, OR ON A PROPOSAL WITHOUT MATERIAL DIFFERENCES, IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
THAT IS, WHERE THE NEGOTIABILITY OF A PROPOSAL IS ESTABLISHED BY AUTHORITY PRECEDENT, AS IN THE PRESENT CASE, IT IS A REFUSAL TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE PROPOSAL IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.
SUCH A REFUSAL TO BARGAIN IS VIOLATIVE OF SECTION 7116(A)(5) AND (1) OF THE STATUTE.
APPLYING THESE PRINCIPLES TO THE INSTANT CASE, THE AUTHORITY FINDS THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSAL IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSAL IN THE DIX-MCGUIRE CASE AND THE AGENCY PROFFERS NO SHOWING THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUCH AS TO WARRANT A DEPARTURE FROM THE NEGOTIABILITY DETERMINATION ON THE "STAY OF ACTION" PROPOSAL IN THE DIX-MCGUIRE CASE.
HENCE, THE RESPONDENT'S REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE ON THE PROPOSAL CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(5) AND (1) OF THE STATUTE.
ORDER
PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SECTION 7118 OF THE STATUTE, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ORDERS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE, U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, COLORADO, SHALL:
1.

(B) IN ANY LIKE OR RELATED MANNER INTERFERING WITH, RESTRAINING, OR COERCING ITS EMPLOYEES
IN THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS ASSURED BY THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE.
2.
TAKE THE FOLLOWING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT THE PURPOSES AND POLICIES OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE:

(B) POST AT THE FACILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE, U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, COLORADO, COPIES OF THE ATTACHED NOTICE ON FORMS TO BE FURNISHED BY THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY.

ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE
DECISION
THIS CASE AROSE PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE, 92 STAT. 1191, 5 U.S.C 7101, ET SEQ., AS A RESULT OF AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE COMPLAINT FILED ON MAY 16, 1980 BY THE ACTING REGIONAL DIRECTOR, REGION 7, FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE, U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY ("RESPONDENT").
THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT RESPONDENT VIOLATED SECTION 7116(A)(1) AND (5) OF THE STATUTE BY REFUSING TO BARGAIN WITH THE UNION CONCERNING A UNION PROPOSAL TO STAY THE DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL OF AN EMPLOYEE UNTIL THE EMPLOYEE HAS EXHAUSTED APPROPRIATE REVIEW PROVISIONS IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.
RESPONDENT DENIES THAT IT VIOLATED THE STATUTE AND ARGUES, IN DEFENSE, THAT (A) THE UNION WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO MAKE THIS PROPOSAL, (B) THE PROPOSAL WAS NONNEGOTIABLE, AND (C) THE INSTANT UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDING IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES.
A HEARING WAS HELD IN THIS MATTER BEFORE THE UNDERSIGNED AT DENVER, COLORADO, ON JULY 30, 1980.
ALL PARTIES WERE REPRESENTED AND AFFORDED FULL OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, ADDUCE RELEVANT EVIDENCE, AND EXAMINE AND CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES.
THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND THE RESPONDENT BOTH FILED BRIEFS WHICH HAVE BEEN DULY CONSIDERED.
/3/ BASED UPON THE ENTIRE RECORD HEREIN, INCLUDING MY OBSERVATION OF THE WITNESSES AND THEIR DEMEANOR, THE EXHIBITS, AND OTHER RELEVANT EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE HEARING, I MAKE THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND RECOMMENDED ORDER:
FINDINGS OF FACT
AT ALL TIMES MATERIAL HEREIN, THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO, LOCAL 1687, ("UNION") HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY RESPONDENT AS THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE OF AN APPROPRIATE UNIT OF EMPLOYEES PAID FROM APPROPRIATED FUNDS BY THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY.
RESPONDENT AND THE UNION WERE PARTIES TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WHICH WAS DUE TO EXPIRE IN 1979.
IN ANTICIPATION OF RENEGOTIATING AN AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES ESTABLISHED NEGOTIATING TEAMS AND EXCHANGED PROPOSED WRITTEN GROUND RULES ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 20, 1979.
PARAGRAPH 6 OF MANAGEMENT'S PROPOSED GROUND RULES PROVIDED AS FOLLOWS:
PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE EXCHANGED WITHIN 10 WORKING DAYS AFTER SIGNING THESE
GROUND RULES AND WILL CONTAIN ALL ARTICLES INTENDED FOR NEGOTIATION.
MANAGEMENT RETAINS THE
RIGHT TO PRESENT FOR NEGOTIATION THOSE ITEMS REQUIRED BY DIRECTIVES OF HIGHER AUTHORITY.
THE UNION VEHEMENTLY OBJECTED TO THIS PROPOSAL SINCE IT DID NOT AFFORD THE UNION A SIMILAR RIGHT TO INTRODUCE NEW "ITEMS" SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXCHANGE OF PROPOSALS.
/4/ THE PARTIES WERE UNABLE TO AGREE ON THIS PROPOSAL AND THE SERVICES OF THE FEDERAL MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE WERE REQUESTED.
ON OCTOBER 9, 1979, THE PARTIES WERE SEPARATED AND THE MEDIATOR WAS ENGAGED IN SHUTTLE NEGOTIATIONS.
THE UNION'S SPOKESMAN PROPOSED (THROUGH THE MEDIATOR) THAT NEGOTIATIONS ON THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES SHOULD COMMENCE WITH "NO GROUND RULES."
THE MEDIATOR TRANSMITTED THIS PROPOSAL TO THE RESPONDENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED THE UNION THAT MANAGEMENT AGREED TO PROCEED WITH "NO GROUND RULES."
AT THIS POINT, THE NEGOTIATING TEAMS HELD ANOTHER JOINT MEETING.
THE SPOKESMAN FOR MANAGEMENT STATED THAT THE LATTER HAD SOME MATTERS ABOUT WHICH IT WAS CONCERNED.
REFERRING TO HIS NOTES, HE LISTED 15 SUCH AREAS.
THE UNION RESPONDED AFFIRMATIVELY TO THREE ITEMS BUT REMAINED SILENT AS TO THE REMAINDER.
ITEM 14 ON RESPONDENT'S LIST SIMPLY STATED THAT "ALL PROPOSALS WILL BE EXCHANGED TODAY."
THE UNION DID NOT RESPOND TO THIS; THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OR FURTHER ELABORATION.
/5/ TO THE EXTENT THAT THE UNION'S SILENCE COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A TACIT AGREEMENT, I INFER THAT, AT THE MOST, THE UNION MERELY AGREED TO EXCHANGE ON THAT DAY ALL SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSALS WHICH HAD BEEN FORMULATED AT THAT TIME.
THE UNION HAD NO INTENTION OF WAIVING THE RIGHT TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS AT A LATER DATE AND DID NOT CLEARLY AND UNMISTAKABLY WAIVE THAT RIGHT.
THIS IS PARTICULARLY SO IN LIGHT OF THE UNION'S PREVIOUS INSISTENCE ON ITS RIGHT TO INTRODUCE NEW PROPOSALS, WHERE REQUIRED BY DIRECTIVES OF HIGHER UNION AUTHORITY, AT ANY TIME DURING NEGOTIATIONS.
MOREOVER, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE UNION AT NO TIME WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED.
DURING THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS OVER SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSALS, BOTH THE UNION AND MANAGEMENT AMENDED THEIR OWN CONTRACT PROPOSALS BY ADDING AND DELETING VARIOUS WORDS OR SECTIONS.
SUBSEQUENTLY, ON FEBRUARY 6, 1980, THE UNION AMENDED ITS PROPOSED ARTICLE CONCERNING DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
THE REVISION CONSISTED OF THE ADDITION OF THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE, HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE "STAY OF ACTION" PROPOSAL:
IN THE EVENT OF A DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL, THE GRIEVANT WILL EXHAUST THE REVIEW
PROVISION CONTAINED IN THE AGREEMENT BEFORE THE SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL IS EFFECTIVE, AND THE
EMPLOYEE WILL REMAIN IN A PAY STATUS UNTIL A FINAL DETERMINATION IS RENDERED.
THE UNION PATTERNED THIS PROPOSAL AFTER A NEARLY IDENTICAL PROPOSAL PREVIOUSLY HELD BY THE AUTHORITY TO BE NEGOTIABLE.
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO, LOCAL 1999 AND ARMY-AIR FORCE EXCHANGE SERVICE, DIX-MCGUIRE EXCHANGE, FORT DIX, NEW JERSEY, CASE NO.
O-NG-20, 2 FLRA NO. 16 (NOVEMBER 29, 1979).
AT THE TIME THAT THE UNION PROPOSED THE ABOVE AMENDMENT, THE DISCIPLINARY ARTICLE OF THE CONTRACT HAD NOT YET BEEN NEGOTIATED.
RESPONDENT DID NOT REJECT THE ABOVE UNION PROPOSAL UNTIL MARCH 6, 1980, AT WHICH TIME MANAGEMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS NONNEGOTIABLE.
RESPONDENT'S SPOKESMAN TOOK THIS POSITION EVEN THOUGH HE WAS AWARE OF THE AUTHORITY'S CONTRARY HOLDING IN THE FORT DIX CASE, SUPRA.
RESPONDENT OPENLY DISAGREED WITH THE AUTHORITY'S DECISION AND DID NOT MENTION ANY "GROUND RULE" IN DEFENSE OF ITS REFUSAL TO BARGAIN AT THAT TIME. /6/
ON MARCH 12, 1980, THE UNION FILED THE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE AGAINST THE RESPONDENT INITIATING THE INSTANT PROCEEDING.
NOTWITHSTANDING THIS CHARGE, THE PARTIES NEGOTIATED OTHER MATTERS TO AGREEMENT AND THE CONTRACT WAS EXECUTED ON APRIL 3, 1980.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
THE FIRST QUESTION PRESENTED FOR DECISION IS WHETHER THE UNION WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE WITH RESPECT TO THE "STAY OF ACTION" PROPOSAL AT ISSUE HEREIN.
IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT A WAIVER WILL BE FOUND ONLY IF IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE CLEARLY AND UNMISTAKABLY WAIVED ITS STATUTORY RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE.
NASA, KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLORIDA, 2 A/SLMR 566, A/SLMR NO. 223 (1972).
RESPONDENT CONTENDS THAT MANAGEMENT AND THE UNION MADE AN ORAL AGREEMENT ON OCTOBER 9, 1979, THAT ALL PROPOSALS WOULD BE EXCHANGED ON THAT DATE AND THAT NO NEW PROPOSALS COULD BE MADE DURING THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS.
RESPONDENT ARGUES THAT THE "STAY OF ACTION" PROPOSAL CONSTITUTED A COMPLETELY NEW SUBJECT THAT WAS INTRODUCED TO THE BARGAINING TABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS.
I DISAGREE WITH THE RESPONDENT'S CONTENTIONS.
IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT THE UNION ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE EXCHANGE OF PROPOSALS.
MANAGEMENT SIMPLY PROPOSED THAT "ALL PROPOSALS WILL BE EXCHANGED TODAY."
THE UNION DID NOT RESPOND TO THIS PROPOSAL AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE MATTER.
SECOND, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE UNION'S SILENCE COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A TACIT AGREEMENT, I INFER THAT THE UNION DID NO MORE THAN AGREE TO EXCHANGE ON THAT DAY ALL SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSALS WHICH HAD BEEN FORMULATED AT THAT TIME.
THE FACTS ARE CLEAR THAT THE UNION WAS NOT CONSCIOUSLY YIELDING THE RIGHT TO INTRODUCE NEW PROPOSALS AT A LATER DATE.
I MUST CONCLUDE AND HOLD THAT THE UNION DID NOT CLEARLY AND UNMISTAKABLY WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE WITH RESPECT TO THE "STAY OF ACTION" PROPOSAL.
/7/
IT WAS THE CLEAR INTENT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 11491 THAT ONCE A DETERMINATION OF NEGOTIABILITY IS MADE THROUGH THE PROCESSES OF THE ORDER, A SUBSEQUENT DECLARATION OF NONNEGOTIABILITY OF THE MATTER WOULD BE AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE.
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, 1 FLRA NO. 101(1979).
THE SAME RESULT SHOULD OBTAIN UNDER THE STATUTE.
IN THE INSTANT CASE, MANAGEMENT'S NEGOTIATING TEAM WAS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THE UNION HAD TAKEN THE "STAY OF ACTION" PROPOSAL FROM A NEGOTIABILITY DECISION BY THE AUTHORITY HOLDING SUCH PROPOSAL TO BE NEGOTIABLE.
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO, LOCAL 1999, AND ARMY-AIR FORCE EXCHANGE SERVICE, DIX-MCGUIRE EXCHANGE, FOR DIX, NEW JERSEY, CASE NO.
O-NG-20, 2 FLRA NO. 16 (NOVEMBER 29, 1979).
THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THE UNION'S PROPOSAL IN THE INSTANT CASE IS, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, IDENTICAL TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE UNION'S PROPOSAL IN THE FORT DIX CASE.
RESPONDENT, HOWEVER, STILL SEEKS TO DISTINGUISH THE INSTANT PROPOSAL, ARGUING THAT A DIFFERENT BARGAINING UNIT AND DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE INVOLVED IN FORT DIX.
HOWEVER, AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE WILL BE FOUND EVEN WHERE THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE PRIOR NEGOTIABILITY CASE WERE DIFFERENT AS LONG AS NO "MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES" CAN BE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO PROPOSALS.
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS, MIDWEST REGION, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, 2 FLRA NO. 74(1980).
I MUST CONCLUDE AND HOLD THAT THERE ARE NO MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NEGOTIABLE PROPOSAL IN FORT DIX AND THE PROPOSAL REJECTED BY MANAGEMENT AS NONNEGOTIABLE IN THE INSTANT CASE.
BOTH PROPOSALS PROVIDED, ESSENTIALLY, THAT AN EMPLOYEE THE AGENCY HAS DECIDED TO DISCIPLINE BY SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE SUSPENDED OR REMOVED PENDING COMPLETION OF THE CONTRACTUAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE, INCLUDING ARBITRATION.
ALSO, IN BOTH CASES THE AGENCY'S BASIC POSITION IS THAT THE UNION'S PROPOSAL IS NONNEGOTIABLE BECAUSE THE PROCEDURE IT CREATES WOULD UNREASONABLY DELAY THE EXERCISE OF THE AGENCY'S AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION 7106(A)(2)(A) OF THE STATUTE TO SUSPEND AND REMOVE EMPLOYEES.
SINCE I AM CONSTRAINED TO FOLLOW THE AUTHORITY'S POSITION IN FORT DIX, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE RESPONDENT HAS VIOLATED SECTION 7116(A)(5) AND (1) OF THE STATUTE BY REFUSING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNION CONCERNING THE "STAY OF ACTION" PROPOSAL.
THE ONLY ISSUE REMAINING FOR DECISION IS WHETHER THE UNION AND THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR ARE PRECLUDED FROM INSTITUTING THE INSTANT UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDING BY VIRTUE OF SECTION 2424.5 OF THE AUTHORITY'S REGULATIONS.
THAT SECTION PROVIDES, IN PART, AS FOLLOWS:
CASES WHICH SOLELY INVOLVE AN AGENCY'S ALLEGATION THAT THE DUTY TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH
DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE MATTER PROPOSED TO BE BARGAINED AND WHICH DO NOT INVOLVE ACTUAL OR
CONTEMPLATED CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT MAY ONLY BE FILED UNDER THIS PART (I.E., AS A
NEGOTIABILITY APPEAL).
IN MY VIEW, THE UNDERLINED PORTION OF THE ABOVE-QUOTED SENTENCE REFERS TO AN AGENCY'S ALLEGATION THAT THE DUTY TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH DOES NOT EXTEND TO A MATTER PROPOSED TO BE BARGAINED BECAUSE, AS PROPOSED, THE MATTER IS INCONSISTENT WITH LAW, RULE, OR REGULATION.
5 C.F.R. 2424.1.
THE INSTANT CASE DOES NOT "SOLELY" INVOLVE THIS TYPE OF QUESTION BECAUSE IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE A FACTUAL DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE UNION HAD WAIVED ITS STATUTORY RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR PROPOSAL.
THE AUTHORITY HAS PREVIOUSLY HELD, UNDER ANALOGOUS CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT FACTUAL DETERMINATIONS CAN BEST BE MADE THROUGH UTILIZATION OF THE INVESTIGATORY AND FORMAL HEARING PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN PART 2423 OF THE AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES PROCEEDINGS.
SEE, E.G., NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, LOCAL 1141 AND DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BUREAU OF MINES, ALBANY METALLURGY RESEARCH CENTER, ALBANY, OREGON, CASE NO.
O-NG-80, 2 FLRA NO. 28(1979).
THEREFORE, I MUST CONCLUDE AND HOLD THAT THE INSTANT CASE WAS PROPERLY BROUGHT BEFORE THE UNDERSIGNED AS AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE PROCEEDING.
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, I RECOMMEND THAT THE AUTHORITY ADOPT THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
PURSUANT TO 5 C.F.R. 7118(A)(7) AND SECTION 2423.26 OF THE FINAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, 45 FED.REG.
3482, 3510(1980), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE, U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, COLORADO, SHALL:
1.

FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO, LOCAL 1867, WHICH INVOLVES A MATTER PREVIOUSLY
DETERMINED TO BE NEGOTIABLE BY THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY.
(B) IN ANY LIKE OR RELATED MANNER INTERFERING WITH, RESTRAINING, OR COERCING ITS EMPLOYEES
IN THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS ASSURED BY THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE.
2.
TAKE THE FOLLOWING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION:
(A) UPON REQUEST OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO, LOCAL 1867,
NEGOTIATE, TO THE EXTENT CONSONANT WITH LAW AND REGULATIONS, CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL TO STAY
THE DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL OF AN EMPLOYEE UNTIL THE EMPLOYEE HAS EXHAUSTED
APPROPRIATE REVIEW PROVISIONS IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.
(B) POST AT THE FACILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE, U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY,
COLORADO, COPIES OF THE ATTACHED NOTICE MARKED "APPENDIX" ON FORMS TO BE FURNISHED BY THE
FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY.
UPON RECEIPT OF SUCH FORMS THEY SHALL BE SIGNED BY THE
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE USAF ACADEMY, AND SHALL BE POSTED AND MAINTAINED BY HIM FOR 60
CONSECUTIVE DAYS THEREAFTER, IN CONSPICUOUS PLACES, INCLUDING BULLETIN BOARDS AND ALL OTHER
PLACES WHERE NOTICES TO EMPLOYEES ARE CUSTOMARILY POSTED.
THE SUPERINTENDENT SHALL TAKE
REASONABLE STEP TO INSURE THAT SUCH NOTICES ARE NOT ALTERED, DEFACED, OR COVERED BY ANY OTHER
MATERIAL.
(C) NOTIFY THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF REGION VII, SUITE 680, CITY CENTER SQUARE, 1100 MAIN

/7/ IT IS ALSO NOTED THAT THE PROPOSAL IN ISSUE CONSTITUTED AN ARGUABLE EXTENSION OF A CONCEPT FOUND IN THE ARTICLE ON DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS WHICH WAS ALREADY ON THE BARGAINING TABLE.
SECTION C(2) OF THAT ARTICLE, AS ADOPTED, SETS FORTH CERTAIN PROCEDURES WHICH DELAY PUNITIVE ACTIONS BY THE EMPLOYER AFTER IT "DETERMINES THAT A SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL FOR DISCIPLINARY CAUSE IS APPROPRIATE."
THE EMPLOYEE MUST FIRST BE GIVEN NOTICE WITH REASONS AND TIME TO RESPOND AND THE EMPLOYER MUST GIVE A WRITTEN DECISION.
