SCHUMER: MAKE TRAINS AS SAFE AS PLANES
Schumer Outlines New Plan To Improve Amtrak, Rail Security, Says Train Security Is Far Behind Newly Strengthened Plane Security Senator Pushing Legislation That Would Enable New ID Checks, Baggage Scans, New Police Personnel, Satellite Technology, Hazardous Material Detection
US Senator CHARLES E. SCHUMER today said that Congress should ensure that the nation's rail system receives security upgrades as strong as those made to airports and air travel and outlined new security measures necessary to ensure rail security.
Schumer stressed the importance of a thriving rail system both to our national transportation system and to the stability of our economy, and called on the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a comprehensive study examining current rail security, determine where security upgrades are most needed, recommend the best ways to implement them and report back in two months.
"Our nation's rail system has to be as secure as our airways.
It's that simple ," Schumer said.
"We need more surveillance cameras, more police officers, more K-9 units and better ID checks - just to name a few new security measures - not only to ensure the security of rail travelers but to ensure their faith and confidence in all forms of travel."
Schumer called on Congress to support legislation to strengthen security for all Amtrak and passenger rail systems.
The bill, supported by Schumer and Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE) among others, allocates $3 billion for to provide new security equipment, training, and personnel, and add new capacity to the nation's railway system.
Approximately $1.5 billion would be used for an aggressive, nationwide security upgrade, featuring a host of new security measures and requirements, potentially including:
1.
Instituting stringent ID checks for all rail passengers.
Baggage scans and random luggage inspections.
Adding more police officers, security personnel, and new K-9 units patrolling railway facilities.
Establishing new and upgraded training programs for railway security personnel .
Installing a new communications system enabling Amtrak to install satellite technology on all trains and build a state-of-the-art train tracking and locator unit.
Installing a hazardous material and explosives detection and response system.
Modernizing railroad tunnels in the New York, Washington and Baltimore areas in order to meet current fire and life-safety standards, providing better ventilation and new escape routes in the event of emergency.
An additional $1.5 billion would be used to add passenger capacity, bringing locomotives scheduled for storage or retirement back into service, repair super-liner trains, replace worn tracks and provide capital for future purchases of high-speed trains.
In the week following the September 11 tragedy, ridership increased by 17% nationally, with Amtrak adding 30% more seating capacity on the Northeast Corridor.
New York's Penn Station experienced a surge in passengers following the attacks, averaging close to 400,000 riders per day- 20,000 more than before.
The Acela and Metroliner trains have also seen increases, ridership up about 36% from this time last year.
"We need Amtrak like we've never needed it before," Schumer said.
" People are riding trains in droves, but that won't continue if they don't think it's as secure as other methods of transportation.
Travel is one of the keys to our economy and a message of freedom to the terrorists.
Having a secure, effective air travel system without a secure, effective passenger rail system doesn't help us.
We need both, and we need it now."
Schumer also released a letter to Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta asking DOT to conduct a comprehensive study of the status of rail security nationwide.
Schumer asked Secretary Mineta to report back the following findings within two months: 1.
Status of current Amtrak safety standards and procedures 2.
List of most urgently need upgrades 3.
Ability of Amtrak to respond and operate in the face of another terrorist attack 4.
Methods of implementation and execution of new security and safety measures
"Amtrak responded admirably to the crisis, quickly training personnel on heightened security and safety procedures, assigning more security officers to stations and trains, and requiring passengers to bring photo identifications for security checks," Schumer wrote.
"These are all good ideas, but they were a one-time response to what was hopefully a one-time event.
The Department of Transportation, by conducting a thorough investigation, is uniquely suited to examine these security measures and a host of others, and determine how to make them permanent...
A report from you recommending specific security upgrades would strengthen our argument and help us pass legislation on par with the new airline security package."
In the days following the September 11^th attacks, Amtrak provided one of the only travel options available in many parts of the country.
Amtrak provided transportation to New York City for families of the victims, firefighters, military personnel, public officials and honored plane tickets of stranded travelers.
Working with the American Red Cross, Amtrak transported thousands of emergency relief kits to New York City and Washington, DC.
"Amtrak stepped up to plate," Schumer said.
"Amtrak helped the stranded get home and helped families get to their loved ones.
When the airports were closed, Amtrak transported blood units to New York and delivered mail to cities around the country.
We're taking care of the airlines, but we can't forget about Amtrak."
Schumer was joined at the press conference by Stan Bagley, Amtrak's Executive Vice President for Operations and members of Amtrak's police force .
