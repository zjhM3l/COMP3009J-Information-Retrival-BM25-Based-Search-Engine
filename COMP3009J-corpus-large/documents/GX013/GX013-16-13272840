Materials Recycled: Glass, paper, plastic, aluminum

Description
Although "Good Sense" only had a six-month life span, a substantial volume of materials was recycled, and certain aspects of this program may serve as a model for other communities.
The project was initiated in the Spring of 1990 by a group of citizens who were, a) concerned by the elimination of free garbage and disposal services in the City of Fairbanks, and, b) eager to see a decrease in the volume of landfilled waste.
Over the six month course of the project, 200 volunteers got involved, $12,000 was raised from local businesses and organizations to build eight collection centers, and over 30 tons of glass, paper, plastic jugs and aluminum were recycled.
However, due to the unexpectedly large volume of materials collected, the program could not be maintained with only a part-time volunteer staff, and five of the eight collection centers had to be closed.
Eventually, when additional program funding could not be obtained from the City of Fairbanks, Good Sense officially folded.
Collection.
As processing and shipping of recyclables was conducted by a local recycling broker, "Good Sense" primarily focused on collection of materials.
With money donated from local businesses, the group constructed eight collection centers each of which could contain eight 55-gallon drums.
Over time, community participation in the program became so great that the centers needed to be emptied one to two times a day--a considerable burden on local volunteers.
Initially, volunteers used their own vehicles for collecting materials; the Kiwanis Club then donated a one-ton truck for this purpose.
Storage/Processing.
At the beginning of the program, materials were picked up and taken to Sandy's Recycling, a local recycling broker.
Due to the high volume of materials at Sandy's, Good Sense volunteers often helped to separate the materials and prepare them for shipment.
After Sandy's went out of business, the materials were sent to Alaska Solid Waste to be reused and recycled.
Shipping.
Shipping of recyclables was arranged by Sandy's Recycling.
She paid standard shipping rates and therefore, economic considerations were a primary concern for her.
She needed to establish a balance between low-end" materials (glass and paper) and "high-end" materials (aluminum).
As such, glass frequently could not be shipped.
"Good Sense" had two semi-truck containers donated to Sandy's for free backhauling to Anchorage.
Current Status of Recycling Project.
The project had a six month life span and is now defunct for reasons discussed below.
However, a new group, Fairbankssans for Recycling, has apparently been established.
Factors Critical to Project's Success
Strong Dedication, Excellent Organization of "Good Sense" Founders
* This six-month pilot project was initiated by a group of immensely dedicated and hard-working individuals.
Critical to their success was the group's overall strategy for approaching the Fairbanks community.
First, they got organized.
They established a "Good Sense" advisory board (comprised of environmentalists, planners, university professors, carpenters, etc.), identified their program goals, articulated their specific needs (e.g., exact funding amounts needed to build shelters, volunteers, a collection truck), and prepared concisely written promotional literature.
In addition, "Good Sense" established its nonprofit status working under the Northern Alaska Environmental Organization.
* Only after this organization effort did they approach local businesses for support.
As a result, the group projected a cohesive, capable image of itself.
Very few businesses turned them down.
Strong Community Involvement (volunteers, businesses, and local organizations)
* At the height of the project, approximately 200 volunteers were involved.
"Good Sense" attracted volunteers through fliers posted around the community, coverage in local newspapers and radio programs, and word-of-mouth.
* Over 45 businesses and organizations donated $12,140 dollars to the "Good Sense" recycling program.
* Community members participated heavily in the program.
Over 30 tons of recyclables were brought to the collection centers during the first six months.
Problems Associated with the Project
Inability to collect huge volume of items from collection centers in a timely manner.
* From the start of the program, the collection centers filled up rapidly and needed to be emptied at least once or twice a day.
However, "Good Sense" didn't have sufficient numbers of volunteers to respond.
Despite the large volunteer participation in the beginning, many of the people began to lose energy and commitment over the course of the project.
* After a few months, "Good Sense" applied for a grant from the city of Fairbanks for a paid driver who could work eight hours a day picking up of the recyclables from the collection centers.
The City declined to offer assistance.
This single problem--the group's inability to collect all the materials from the centers--was the primary reason that "Good Sense" failed to survive.
Abundance of "low-end" materials; not enough "high-end" materials.
* Another problem the group faced was the abundance of low-end materials (e.g., glass and paper) they were receiving, compared with the small amount of high-end materials (aluminum).
After a few months, Sandy's, the recycling broker, decided it was not economically viable to process such large amounts of low-end materials--given the high shipping costs.
* Then "Good Sense" started using an alternate recycling broker known as Alaska Solid Waste (ASW).
ASW, which accepts all materials, attempts to reuse materials rather than recycle them.
For example, ASW turns paper into bio-mass logs used for burning; it pulverizes glass and uses it for sand-blasting or road sand; and it meshes plastic and used tire strips to create siding for warehouses.
However, ASW apparently does not operate on a regular schedule; it occasionally closes for days at a time.
Therefore, even if GoodSense had remained active, ASW might not have provided a reliable market for their materials.
"Good Sense" also launched its own initiative for reusing low-end materials.
Their plan was to generate interest among local businesses for reprocessing such materials (i.e., crushed glass could be repackaged and sold as landscaping rock).
But the attempt proved unsuccessful, perhaps due to the small size of the Fairbanks community.
Costs
Revenues and Other Benefits of Recycling.
Revenues.
"Good Sense" did not receive any of the revenues from the recyclables; this money was paid directly to the recycling broker, Sandy's.
Benefits of Recycfing.
The recycling program offered an alternative to Fairbanks ans who, starting in 1990, had to pay to dispose of their garbage ($45/ton) Program Costs.
Program Costs
Labor.
There were approximately 200 volunteers donating their time to this project (including the coordinator and members of the advisory board).
The program coordinator indicated that it was a full-time job (i.e., driving around to the various collection centers, hauling the materials, sorting them at Sandy's, in addition to paperwork and overall administrative tasks)
Shipping/Equipment/Capital Expenditures.
All equipment (e.g., semi-tractor trailer, 55-gallon barrels, and tools) was donated by local businesses.
Funding Mechanisms.
This project was financed primarily through the donations from local businesses and organizations as well as by the volunteers and "Good Sense" founders.
