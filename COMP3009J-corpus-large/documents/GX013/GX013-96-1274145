Building Big
Documentary
Think big! Engineers have been doing just that for thousands of years, as renowned author-illustrator David Macaulay proves in this five-part miniseries on spectacular structures.
The programs cover bridges, domes, skyscrapers, dams, and tunnelspast and present.
Along the way, Macaulay highlights the engineering principles and human stories behind some of the most remarkable achievements in the history of building.
Program 1 Bridges
How does a bridge withstand the forces of nature and traffic? David Macaulay takes viewers from the stone arch bridges of the Roman Empire to Japan's giant, all-steel Akashi Kaikyo suspension bridge, the longest in the world.
Through the epic sagas of the Brooklyn, Golden Gate, and other great bridges, Macaulay shows how engineers have conquered ever-wider spans with better construction materials and innovative designs.
Program 2 Domes
How does a dome support itself? Ever since the Roman Emperor Hadrian topped his Pantheon with a dome, this roof-with-class has been the prestige building form.
Big domes cover civilization's most revered structures, from great cathedrals to mosques to houses of government.
David Macaulay uncovers the tricky technology of domes, from the Pantheon to the geodesic marvels of Buckminster Fuller and beyond.
Program 3 Skyscrapers
What does it take to erect a skyscraper 100 stories tall? From the medieval towers of Italy's San Gimignano to today's race to build the world's tallest skyscraper, David Macaulay chronicles our aptitude for altitude.
On the way up, he highlights the remarkable achievements of the Gothic cathedral builders and the almost-disaster of New York's Citigroup (formerly Citicorp) Center.
Program 4 Dams
How does a dam resist the crush of millions of gallons of water? David Macaulay surveys the dam Â¾ the biggest, costliest structure of all Â¾ from Hoover's concrete arch confronting the Colorado River to the Aswan High Dam, a veritable underwater mountain sitting on the Nile riverbed, holding back a lake the size of England.
Program 5 Tunnels
What keeps a tunnel from collapsing? Tunnels have advanced from dangerous, claustrophobic passages to spacious, safe subterranean networks as roomy as shopping malls.
David Macaulay takes viewers underground to explore the history and ingenuity behind some of the world's tunneling marvels.

The Crucible of the Millennium
Documentary
The years surrounding 1500 represent a pivotal time in human history, marking the birth of our Modern Age.
During that period, the invention of the printing press in Europe, based on a Chinese invention, spurred an information revolution and changed the way people envisioned the world.
Different peoples, cultures, and religions came into contact with another, often for the first time, and sometimes violently.
The reverberations of these developments are still felt today in the interconnectedness of cultures and economics and in issues related to immigration, the environment, economic inequality, nationalism, and racism.
The two-part special examines the technological advances, the wide-ranging exploration and the collision of cultures that characterized the midpoint of the last millennium, revealing why an understanding of that period is critical to an understanding of the world today.
Part I Through the Looking Glass tells the story of Calicut, a bustling port city on the coast of southwest India that was the crossroads of many cultures, a place that gave rise to the trade on a global scale.
The program captures the experience and adventures of three 15th-century visitors to Calicutthe royal leader of a Chinese maritime expedition as auspicious as any that followed, an ambassador from the Ottoman court and a Portuguese explorer whose visit changed the course of history.
Part II Echoes and Resonances chronicles 15th- and 16th-century interactions between Europeans and the peoples of the Americas and Africa.
The program follows the exploits of the early European explorers and shows how their explorations, conquests and trade in everything from sugar to human beings ultimately brought the entire world, often reluctantly, into permanent contact, and raised issues of colonial domination that remain unresolved to this day.
The program concludes with prominent scholars offering their views on the issues raised by the program and exploring solutions.

Napoleon
Documentary
Napoleon is a four-hour public television series about one of historys most exciting, complex, and controversial characters.
Framed by the grand sweep of world events, the series recalls some of historys most dramatic moments through the story of one man, whose life mirrored the times in which he lived, and whose extraordinary impact continues to this day.
The series presents Napoleon as a man of substance, as well as a man of unchecked ambitions.
A chronological account of Napoleons life, the series charts his dramatic rise to power as Emperor of France and his bitter final years spent in exile on the tiny, remote island of St. Helena.
In examining Napoleons intersection with the major events and issues of the age, the series shows how those influences shaped the man, and how, in turn, he shaped the course of world history.

Passage to India
Documentary Radio Series
The series presents India on its own terms and in its own words by exploring ten "passages" or keys to understanding modern India.
Interviews and other recorded materials were gathered throughout the country, from Punjab to Calcutta, the Himalayas to Kerala, and from all sections of Indian society: Brahmins and Untouchables, Muslims, Sikhs and Tribals, pavement dwellers and Maharajahs.
The programs interweave readings of poems and short stories from Classical and Contemporary Indian culture into the documentary fabric.
Program 1 A Kaleidoscope of Cultures Language, race, religion, geography and climate-India is so diverse that by rights it shouldn't really be a country at all: and yet it is this very diversity that contains within it the secret that somehow binds Indians together.
Program 2 The Presence of the Past In the West we live almost entirely in the present and the future.
But life in India is dominated and shaped by its past and by very different notions of time itself.
The program uses the example of the political career of Mahatma Gandhi to show how Gandhi consciously blended past and present to deliberate political ends.
Program 3 Puja: Darsan Dena, Darsan Lena Hinduism is a bewildering mosaic of mythologies, rituals and gods.
This program looks at Hinduism as worship in the daily lives of Indians.
Several of the best---known Hindu myths are retold by Indian actors.
The programs also features recordings of religious festivals to the gods Siva, Vishnu, and Parvati.
Program 4 Biryani and Plum Pudding India is the "black hole" of civilizations, with a unique ability to absorb, incorporate and synthesize other cultures into something new and typically Indian.
The program focuses on the Muslim and British impact on India and the manner in which they, in their turn, have been Indianised.
Program 5 Vedas, Ragas, and Storytellers In a country where only 35 percent of the population is formally literate, oral cultures are enormously important even today, although modern education, politics and mass media are rapidly modifying the face-to-face nature of ancient styles of performance and perception.
The program looks at the oral tradition in classical, folk, and popular cultures and how these traditions are handed down through the generations.
Program 6 In Search of Filmwallahs The Indian cinema is the largest in the world; over 800 new films every year and over eleven million film goers every day.
It's the dominant cultural form in today's India, retelling the past, interpreting the present, and creating new myths and dreams for millions, many uneducated and uprooted from their past.
Program 7 Praneschacharya's Dilemma Western individualism is, in many ways, alien to the Indian psyche.
Indians operate within circles of dependence and interdependence of family, caste, language and religion.
Indians define themselves on a multitude of levels and through a mosaic of identities, justifying behavior through right action or Dharma.
The modernization of sections of Indian society therefore creates new tensions and contradictions between individual and community roles and identities.
Program 8 Sita Speak! In Hindu mythology women are usually all powerful, creative, and endowed with shakti or all-pervading energy.
In practice, Indian women have been submissive and self effacing, prisoners of their very virtues.
Today, the situation is full of tensions and contradictions as legislation and self-assertiveness on the part of educated and illiterate, affluent and poor women clash with centuries of tradition and immobilism.
Program 9 Swadeshi: The Quest for Self-Reliance India, more than any other country save China, has pursued a conscious and continuous policy of economic self-reliance and political non-alignment since Independence.
The causes for this single-minded policy have roots deep within Indian culture.
The results have allowed India to remain independent but at considerable economic and political cost.
Recent liberalization, while opening up the economy and accelerating growth, also threatens to widen the gap between urban and rural India, between rich and poor, and to compromise national community.
Program 10 Ram Rajya: In Search of Indian Democracy At first glance, India would not appear to be fertile soil for democracy.
The rigidities and hierarchies inherent in caste, religion and India's multiple societies, combined with a history of despotic rule from several centers, appears to be totally at odds with the vibrancy of Indian democracy.
Furthermore, democratic institutions have been under severe abuse in recent years.
Communalism, caste warfare, pervasive corruption and the breakdown of democratic civility all threaten the health of Indian democracy.
And yet Indian voters may be illiterate, but they are also shrewd and treasure the right to vote as the one safeguard against abuse and tyranny.

The Roman Empire in the First Century
Documentary
Two thousand years ago, at the dawn of the first century, the world was ruled by Rome.
The Roman Empire struggled with problems which are surprisingly familiar: violent coups, assassination, overarching ambition, civil war, clashes between the classes as well as the sexes, and questions of personal freedom versus government control.
But from the chaos, the Roman Empire would emerge stronger and more dazzling than ever before.
Soon, it would stretch from Britain across Europe to the shores of North Africa and from Spain across Greece and the Middle East to the borders of Asia.
It would embrace hundreds of languages and religions and till its many cultures into a rich soil from which Western civilization would grow.
Rome would become the world's first and most enduring super power.
Episode I Order from Chaos
Millions of people-both famous and uncelebrated-played parts in the astonishing rise of Rome, but above them all was Caesar Augustus.
Raised amid civil war, Augustus came to personify the people he led.
He was contradictory, at once capable of brutal violence and tender compassion.
He was influential, forging the image of Roman grandeur that endures to this day.
And he was enormously popular.
But those that crossed Augustus often faced dire consequences: his rivals Marc Antony and Cleopatra; the poet, Ovid; even his own daughter, Julia.
The story of Augustan Rome is the story of greatness at a price.
Episode II Years of Trial
In the year 14 AD, Augustus died and the Empire stood at a crossroads.
Would Rome continue on the course set by its first emperor...or return to chaos? A reluctant new emperor quickly inhabited the imperial palace and quickly confronted mutiny and intrigue.
At first, Tiberius struggled to live up to his predecessor, but he soon abandoned the effort.
Tiberius' ultimate decline from ascetic ruler to reclusive despot ushered in one of the most notorious rulers of the ancient world-Caligula.
As fear and conspiracy descended on Rome, crisis roiled the provinces.
In Judaea, a charismatic leader named Jesus challenged the religious and political establishment.
The local furor barely touched Rome, but the legacy of Jesus would one day engulf the Empire itself.
Episode III Winds of Change
Claudius, the most unlikely member of the imperial family, becomes one of the greatest emperors of the Roman Empire-only to fall victim to a brutally ambitious wife.
A principled philosopher named Seneca found himself compromised as a tutor to the erratic young Nero.
In Britain, a warrior queen named Boudicca battled Roman legions, and in Judaea, the Jewish people revolted.
Under Nero's disastrous rule, Rome nearly burned to the ground.
The Empire was on the edge of disaster.
Episode IV Years of Eruption
With Nero's death, the dynasty of Augustus came to an end.
And once again, the Empire faced an uncertain future.
Rival generals fought for supremacy in the streets of Rome.
A new dynasty brought another tyrant to the throne.
Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying Pompeii and thousands of people beneath a torrent of ash and mud.
But the Empire weathered the crisis.
As the first century drew to a close, Rome's legacy was destined to reverberate across the ages.

Shoulder to Shoulder
Dramatic Series
Shoulder to Shoulder follows the lives of three members of the Pankhurst family and those of other pioneers of women's suffrage in England at the end of the nineteenth century.
Originally aired on Masterpiece Theater, the Endowment provided funds to acquire the series for re-broadcast and to support the production of introductory material by actress Jane Alexander.
Program 1 The Pankhurst Family Emmeline Pankhurst, who shares her recently deceased husband's passion for social reform, emerges as the force behind the new Manchester-based organization, the Women's Social and Political Union, and with daughters Christabel and Sylvia, mobilizes other women in efforts to change British attitudes and laws.
Program 2 Annie Kenney By age 13, Annie Kenney was working full-time in the Lancaster mills.
When the women's movement moves to London, Kenney becomes a suffrage organizer after a chance meeting with Christabel Pankhurst.
Her efforts bring the working class into the women's movement.
Program 3 Lady Constance Lytton A member of the aristocracy, Lady Constance Lytton becomes convinced of the need for confrontational tactics in the struggle for suffrage.
She also strikes out against the class system.
Program 4 Christabel Pankhurst Emmeline Pankhurst's oldest daughter, Christabel, emerges as a youthful militant leader.
This program explores her opinions and ideology.
Program 5 Outrage On Derby Day, June 4, 1913, Emily Wilding Davidson throws herself under the hoofs of the King's horse at the Derby.
Her death makes her the first of many martyrs for women's rights.
This episode also tells the story of the critical break that develops between sisters Sylvia and Christabel Pankhurst.
Program 6 Sylvia Pankhurst Women in England win the vote as a direct result of suffragette support for World War I, but for some, like Sylvia Pankhurst, it is a shallow victory.
Sylvia, a pacifist who has broken with her mother and sister because she opposes England's entry into the war, becomes a strong supporter of the Russian Revolution, writes a book on Russia, completes a biography of her mother, and campaigns for the greater freedom and independence of all people.
