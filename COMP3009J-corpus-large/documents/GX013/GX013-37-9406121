The age-adjusted incidence rate was higher in 1999 for white women, 17.6 per 100,000, compared with 13.1/100,000 for Asians or Pacific Islanders, 12.0/100,000 for Hispanics, and 11.8/100,000 for blacks.
Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.
During this year, 25,400 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed and 14,300 women will die of the disease.
When ovarian cancer is found and treated in its earliest stages, the 5-year survival rate is 95 percent.
However, most women suffering from ovarian cancer are not diagnosed until the later stages when the disease has spread and the 5 year survival rate is close to 30%.
Because early detection and treatment can often mean the difference between life and death, developing an effective screening test is needed.

CDC-Funded Projects
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is working on several research projects related to ovarian cancer research.
* Health Care Seeking Behaviors and Ovarian Cancer -- A research project with the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston is assessing the health care seeking behaviors among women who have symptoms that can be suggestive of ovarian cancer.
This project aims to identify factors that influence health care seeking behavior and factors that may be modifiable through public health interventions to help shorten the length of time between the appearance of symptoms of ovarian cancer and a woman's decision to visit a doctor.
Preliminary data will be available during 2004.
* Ovarian Cancer Treatment Patterns and Outcomes -- Tumor registries in California, Maryland, and New York are analyzing ovarian cancer treatment data obtained from hospital and private provider medical records.
This 3-year study will evaluate the percentage of patients who received the recommended standard of care for first and second course treatment, the outcomes of these treatments, and the patients' survival rates.
The quality and completeness of ovarian cancer staging data collected by these registries will also be evaluated.
Protocol development and staff training have been completed.
The data collection will begin in 2003.
* Evaluating of Hospice Referral and End-of-Life Care for Ovarian Cancer in the Managed Care Environment -- Little is known about end-of-life care for women with ovarian cancer.
Results from prior studies suggest that doctors often do not provide adequate medication to alleviate the pain experienced by patients near the end of life.
The objective of this project is to describe end-of-life care for women who have died of ovarian cancer.
The study will include a retrospective review of these women's medical records for the last six months of life examining such aspects of care as the patient's clinical signs and symptoms, the therapies used to treat the disease, guidelines for determining when a patient is approaching the end of life, and how this status is handled by the health professionals involved.
Managed care organizations working on this project include the Alliance of Community Health Plans, Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Kaiser Permanente of Northern California-Oakland, and Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region in Portland, Oregon.
The project is expected to be completed during 2004.
Information from the projects will assist CDC with understanding ovarian cancer symptoms, needed medical guidelines, treatment patterns, and end-of-life care in the managed care environment.
