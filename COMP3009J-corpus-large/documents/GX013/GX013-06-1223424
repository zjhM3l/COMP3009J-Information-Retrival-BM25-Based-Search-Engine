USTR Announces Allocation of the Raw Cane Sugar, Refined Sugar and Sugar Containing Products Tariff-Rate Quotas For 2001/2002
WASHINGTON - The Office of the United States Trade Representative today announced the country-by-country allocations of the raw cane sugar, refined sugar, and sugar-containing products tariff-rate quotas for Fiscal Year (FY) 2002.
A tariff-rate quota is an import policy that allows a specified quantity of imports of a product at a relatively low tariff, and subjects all other imports of that product to a higher tariff.
A tariff-rate quota quantity for raw cane sugar of 1,117,195 metric tons, the minimum level to which the United States is committed under the Uruguay Round Agreement, is being allocated to the following countries: Country Argentina Australia Barbados Belize Bolivia Brazil Colombia Congo Cote d'Ivoire Costa Rica Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador Fiji Gabon Guatemala Guyana Haiti Honduras India Jamaica Madagascar Malawi Mauritius Mexico Mozambique Nicaragua Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines South Africa St. Kitts

These allocations are based on the countries' historical trade to the United States.
The allocations of the raw sugar tariff-rate quota to countries that are net importers of sugar are conditioned on receipt of the appropriate verifications of origin.
This allocation includes the following minimum-quota countries: Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Haiti, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, St. Kitts 
It was also announced that 20,344 metric tons of the refined sugar tariff-rate quota not reserved for specialty sugar (13,656 metric tons) or Mexico's NAFTA allocation (137,788 metric tons) is being allocated in the following manner: 10,300 metric tons (11,354 short tons) is allocated to Canada, and 2,954 metric tons (3,256 short tons) is allocated to Mexico.
The remaining 7,090 metric tons (7,815 short tons) of the in-quota quantity may be supplied by any country, subject to any other provisions of the law, on a first-come, first-served basis.
The 13,656 metric tons (15,053 short tons) reserved for specialty sugars may also be supplied by any country, subject to any other provisions of the law, on a first-come, first-served basis.
With respect to the tariff-rate quota for certain sugar-containing products maintained under Additional U.S. Note 8 to chapter 17 to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 59,250 metric tons (65,312 short tons) is being allocated to Canada.
The remainder of the sugar-containing products tariff-rate quota is available for other countries on a first-come, first-served basis.
Total imports of raw and refined sugar from Mexico entering under its NAFTA allocation may not exceed 137,788 metric tons (151,885 short tons).
