Good afternoon.
I would like to thank the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, and in particular Hans-Joachim Hogrefe and Paula Clamurro for the opportunity to address you today.
Northern Iraq, better known to my people as Iraqi Kurdistan is a region historically dominated by the ethnic Kurds, who represent as much as 90% of the population.
Assyrians and Turkomans make up the remainder of the people.
Despite these hardships, the safe haven enabled my people to experience democracy and real freedom for the first time in our history.
People were able to openly protest against the government and other institutions, something never allowed before.
My brothers could walk down the street without having to present ID's on demand and our men were no longer forced to join the military whenever the government wished.
Dozens of newspapers were finally printed in Kurdish, entirely free of government control offering uncensored criticism and commentary.
Our schools no longer fed propaganda, and my city's university was reopened after being shut down by Saddam in 1976.
In 1992 we held our first open, democratic, multi-party elections.
With the help of the United Nations and numerous foreign NGOs, we were also able to undertake important rehabilitation, reconstruction and resettlement initiatives.
I worked with two of the NGOs - Response, Relief, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (4RS), and Associazione di Cooperazione allo Sviluppo, (ACS) - as part of Operation Provide Comfort in 1995, which were dedicated to providing humanitarian assistance to those Kurds whose villages were destroyed during the government's campaign of genocide.
I traveled throughout the region with my organization and had a chance to personally witness much of this humanitarian work firsthand.
The Iraqi government did not welcome the foreign NGOs operating in the Kurdish safe haven.
Saddam declared a bounty on the head of every foreign worker, while those Kurds who assisted NGOs were declared to be traitors to Iraq.
Despite these dangers, the NGOs did their best to give us some sense of hope for the future.
Today, only the first three are controlled by the Kurds and are protected as the Kurdish safe haven in Northern Iraq.
The others remain under Saddam's control, including Kirkuk, where 70% of the nation's oil can be found.
As an Iraqi Kurd, I witnessed and experienced tremendous suffering before leaving Iraq a few years ago, and even now I continue to learn about the ongoing suffering of my people.
I am hoping that by sharing my personal experiences you will understand and recognize the urgent need of the Kurds for protection by the international community.
Their rights as a people and their lives must be protected now, as well as during and after any potential military conflict.
I was twelve years old when I experienced first hand the suffering of my people.
One evening in the spring of 1987 one of my aunts and her whole family showed up on our doorstep in Sulaymaniyah unexpectedly.
We learned that their village, Askar, was one of several that were attacked by Iraqi helicopters using chemical gas and then turned into rubble by bulldozers.
My aunt's family had managed to avoid the military and find their way to our home.
They spent eleven months hiding with us.
Later, the Iraqi regime relocated them to newly built government settlements, where they could be closely watched by the military.
They were not allowed to return to their farms and were turned from hard-working, independent people into people dependent on the government for their simplest needs.
Over time my family discovered that at least 40 of our relatives living in the villages had been killed during this genocidal campaign, known as the government's Anfal policy.
Only those relatives who managed to escape or hide survived the horror of Anfal, which killed more than 150,000 other Kurds.
Three years later, after our failed uprising against Saddam Hussein in 1991, the Iraqi army used every possible form of brutality as they moved into the Northern Iraq, destroying everyone and everything before them.
In the middle of a cold, rainy winter night we were awakened by the sound of bombs.
It was clear that Saddam's army was very close.
My parents feared that Saddam would again use chemical gas like he did during the genocidal campaign.
So, like hundreds of thousands of other frightened Kurds, we fled.
We said goodbye to our home and joined the flood of other refugees crowding the streets on our way out of the city and out of Iraq in search of sanctuary.
We walked on foot for ten days through the mountains before we reached Iran and safety, poorly clothed for the harsh weather and without enough food or water.
We were surrounded by the sound of misery and distress, and witnessed families burying their dead along the road and weeping mothers unable to let go of their dead infants.
Due to shock, one of my brothers suffered terrible seizures a few times a day.
We finally made it into Baneh, a town within the border of Iran.
Other than the very limited portions of food that we were given by the Iranian government, we received no other kind of humanitarian assistance.
Every one of us was ill and needed urgent medical attention.
More than 500 of us were crowded into a small unsanitary mosque and lived and slept shoulder-to-shoulder.
Because the food we did receive as refugees was not sufficient, my little brothers had to go door-to-door and beg local Iranians for food.
We cried with our mother every day, not knowing if we would ever see our home again or if we would spend the rest of our lives as refugees.
After a month, we heard on the radio that the U.N. had established a Kurdish safe haven in Northern Iraq, free from the influence of Saddam Hussein, so that we could return home safely.
However, many Kurds did not come back right away.
They feared that the Iraqi military would still try to kill them.
My family was also scared, but we chose to return home rather than live as refugees.
When we finally returned home we learned that some of our other relatives did not survive the exodus.
My mother's aunt had been in the hospital when we left, but died along with hundreds of other patients abandoned by the staff, who were forced to flee the city as well.
My uncle was found frozen to death in the mountains.
On the radio we heard that more than a thousand Kurds died every day during the exodus.
We hoped that our relatives who had not returned yet were not among the dead.
Although my immediate family arrived home safely, we were not unharmed.
Each of us suffered some kind of long-term health problem, from seizures and depression to chronic hair loss and internal illnesses.
Although Saddam's army was forced by the U.S- led coalition to leave the Kurdish safe haven in 1991, he was still able to make us suffer.
We were already struggling with the difficulties imposed on Iraq by the U.N. sanctions after the Gulf War, so Saddam imposed additional sanctions on our region as punishment for the creation of the safe haven.
As a result, we no longer received salaries or pensions from the Iraqi government and our supplies of heating kerosene and electricity were cut-off completely.
Consequently, we suffered terribly on the cold winter nights.
Despite these hardships, the safe haven enabled my people to experience democracy and real freedom for the first time in our history.
People were able to openly protest against the government and other institutions, something never allowed before.
My brothers could walk down the street without having to present ID's on demand and our men were no longer forced to join the military whenever the government wished.
Dozens of newspapers were finally printed in Kurdish, entirely free of government control offering uncensored criticism and commentary.
Our schools no longer fed propaganda, and my city's university was reopened after being shut down by Saddam in 1976.
In 1992 we held our first open, democratic, multi-party elections.
With the help of the United Nations and numerous foreign NGOs, we were also able to undertake important rehabilitation, reconstruction and resettlement initiatives.
I worked with two of the NGOs - Response, Relief, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (4RS), and Associazione di Cooperazione allo Sviluppo, (ACS) - as part of Operation Provide Comfort in 1995, which were dedicated to providing humanitarian assistance to those Kurds whose villages were destroyed during the government's campaign of genocide.
I traveled throughout the region with my organization and had a chance to personally witness much of this humanitarian work firsthand.
The Iraqi government did not welcome the foreign NGOs operating in the Kurdish safe haven.
Saddam declared a bounty on the head of every foreign worker, while those Kurds who assisted NGOs were declared to be traitors to Iraq.
Despite these dangers, the NGOs did their best to give us some sense of hope for the future.
In the fall of 1996, because of internal infighting amongst the Kurds that was fueled by Turkey, Iran, Syria, and the PKK, Saddam's army temporarily entered our safe haven.
This incursion was seen as a serious threat to the foreign aid workers, who immediately began pulling out of Northern Iraq.
Because of our work with the foreign NGO's, we were not granted amnesty by Saddam Hussein.
In fact, we were condemned as traitors and spies.
Feeling abandoned and scared, I and more than 70,000 Kurds from my city began fleeing the country.
Only when the U.S government realized the danger we were in, did they offer us asylum and begin evacuating 6,400 of us to United States.
Since coming to this country, I have remained in close contact with my family.
From them I have learned about the ongoing progress that my people have made as a result of the freedom and democracy we have achieved under the protection of the safe haven.
Throughout the safe haven, the political system has grown even more diverse and open since I left, with more than 36 registered political parties representing all ethnic and religious groups participating in free and fair elections today.
The very first private schools are opening, teaching a liberal, secular curriculum instead of the traditional Iraqi education.
My sister has been lucky to find a teaching position at an American funded school that uses American teaching methods.
Some of these schools are created specifically for the ethnic Turkomans and Assyrians so that their children can learn in their own language.
Technologies, such as international phone services, Satellite T.V. and internet are now everyday conveniences.
Many of the villages have been completely rebuilt and are productive communities once again.
Foreign journalists are welcomed into all areas without restrictions of any kind.
However, I am concerned about the serious problems that threaten this progress.
Today, neighboring countries continue to interfere in Kurdish affairs and aim to destroy our fragile democracy.
Iran supports extremist Islamic groups that have killed and caused terror for more than a decade.
I almost lost a brother to a bombing by one of these groups during the New Year's celebration of 2002 and his best friend remains paralyzed from this attack.
When the local government for the first time opened a cafÃ¯Â¿Â½ that welcomed women, Islamic terrorists blew it up.
Turkey has thousands of troops within our borders and has warned of their territorial aspirations in Northern Iraq.
My father has told me that Kurdish leaders have repeatedly asked the Turks to withdraw, but that they have ignored all such requests.
In addition to a long history of incursions by Turkey, Iran and Saddam's government, the Kurdish safe haven is vulnerable to incursions by terrorist groups - such as Ansar Al-Islam and the PKK -and other destabilizing influences.
The no-fly zone is of no real help in stopping them.
One troubling development is the Saudi plan to bring Wahabism to the Kurds.
This is the extremist type of Islam spread by Osama bin Laden and al Qaida.
The Saudis are funding the construction of mosques and founding charities in order to expose the tolerant Sunni Kurds to this dangerous brand of Islam.
The possibility of another war in Iraq has left the Kurds with a serious dilemma.
While we would like nothing more to see than Saddam Hussein and his entire regime removed, if a war only results in another totalitarian government taking over, then all we have worked to create in the past ten years will be lost.
As my father tells me, the Kurds have tasted the fruits of freedom and democracy and will never be able to live without them again.
The Kurds fear that without international protection, Saddam may once again take out his anger on our people like he did after the Gulf War.
This would lead to another massive exodus as in 1991, a humanitarian tragedy that must be avoided at all costs.
Most families have already packed for the possibility of having to flee their homes.
More than anything else, my family fears that Saddam will use chemical gas again.
Everyone fears that tomorrow might mean the loss of every right and freedom we have, including our lives.
These problems have left my people with little hope for a safe future.
It is imperative that the Kurdish situation be given serious consideration if stability and a free democracy in Iraq are to be achieved.
The Kurds recognize the United States as a defender of democracy and freedom wherever it takes root.
With America's comprehensive military protection from Saddam's genocidal regime, our hard-won experiment in democracy can succeed and become an example to all people in the Middle East.
The Kurds also recognize the United States as the champion of human rights and justice.
Iraq has the opportunity to become a pluralistic, federal democracy that respects and protects the rights of every one of its citizens, whether they are Arab, Kurd, Assyrian or Turkoman, but needs America and its ally's leadership to achieve that goal.
The leadership of the United Sates is essential to achieving an end to the oppression and genocide that my people have suffered for the past century.
Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen; I implore you to lead the International Community to stand by our side and save the next generation of Kurds from the suffering that I and previous generations have endured.
Thank you 'all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights' - Universal Declaration of Human Rights
