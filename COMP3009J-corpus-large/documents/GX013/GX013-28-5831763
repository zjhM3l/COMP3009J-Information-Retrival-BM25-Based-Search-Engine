Organic Production: Economic Aspects
1.
NAL Call No.: HD9000.1.F66 1992: a non-event? Perceptions of the food chain.
Darrall, J. Food-Policy.
v.17(1): p.81-83.
(1992 Feb.)
Descriptors: food production; food industry; markets; organic foods; fruit; vegetables; milk products; cereal products; market surveys; effects Abstract: The literature on the Single European Market is divided between the views that it will be a non-event and that it will present great opportunities for the food chain.
Research is discussed investigating the opinions of 683 farmers, companies and retailers about 1992.
Half the respondents felt they would be affected, the majority in a positive way (particularly the retailers and food companies).
It is concluded that for a third to half the food chain 1992 will be a non-event, but for the other half it could present a wide variety of opportunities.

NAL Call No.: TX1.H63 Alaskan direct-market consumers: perception of organic produce.
Swanson, R. B.; Lewis, C. E. Home-econ-res-j. v.22(2): p.138-155.
(1993 Dec.)
Includes references.
Descriptors: organic foods; consumer preferences; dietary surveys; market surveys Abstract: Perception of organic produce among Alaskan direct-market patrons (N = 417) was examined in a mailed survey.
Response rate was 80%.
Response frequency was tabulated, and relationships were delineated using chi-square analysis.
Healthfulness of the food supply was a concern, despite a perception that quality and healthfulness of the food supply had improved since 1987.
These attributes were also important in fresh produce selection.
Organic produce preference was related to both environmental and personal-safety concerns.
More than half of these consumers had purchased organic produce within the last year; supermarkets and direct markets were the primary sources.
Although organic produce was not purchased exclusively, previous purchase increased the likelihood of future purchase.
A certification process was desired.
Half preferred a government certification agent; 28% preferred public and private sector involvement.
Information dissemination should address (a) pesticide use for cosmetic purposes, b) appearance and food safety, (c) flavor and shipping characteristics, and (d) production method and nutritive content.

NAL Call No.: S605.5.A43 Barriers to low-input agriculture adoption: a case study of Richmond County, Virginia.
Diebel, P. L.; Taylor, D. B.; Batie, S. S. Am-J-altern-agric. v.8(3): p.120-127.
(1993) Includes references.
Descriptors: low input agriculture; innovation adoption; case studies; organic farming; economic analysis; virginia; economic barriers Abstract: We coupled a nonlinear mathematical programming model with sensitivity analysis and evaluated some economic barriers to adoption of low-input agriculture by farmers in Richmond County, Virginia.
Collection of primary data made the model more realistic.
We analyzed potential barriers to adoption, including poultry litter price, yields, labor requirements, and variable input costs.
We found the adoption of low-input practices to be sensitive to the price of poultry litter and relatively insensitive to yields, labor requirements, and variable costs.
However, when several of these harriers are combined, the model predicts that farmers would use conventional practices.
Therefore analysis of the farm as a system rather than practice by practice is important when identifying the effects of economic barriers.

Taylor, D. C.; Feuz, D. M.; Guan, M. Am-J-altern-agric. v.11(1): p.30-38.
(1996) Includes references.
Descriptors: beef cattle; cattle farming; organic farming; sustainability; beef production; indexes; natural resources; resource conservation; environmental protection; economic evaluation; case studies; south dakota; producer organic index; producer sustainability index Abstract: Organic and sustainable fed cattle production are compared through development and estimation of two production indexes: a Producer Organic Index (POI) and a Producer Sustainability Index (PSI).
The POI reflects current production standards for organically certified beef.
The PSI reflects a broader range of concerns, including long-term natural resource conservation and economic staying-power of cattle producers.
The study shows there may be only a loose connection between the two.
The method used to develop the indexes can provide insights to beef cattle extension specialists and individual cattle producers on the strengths and weaknesses of current feedlot management practices.

A hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L. Roth.) organic mulch system for fresh-market tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) production provides environmental benefits by enhancing the soil and reducing the need for fertilizer and herbicide inputs and is more profitable than conventional practices.
Tomato field trials over 3 years at the Beltsville (Md.)
Agricultural Research Center compared tee hairy vetch mulch system with black polyethylene mulch and bare ground (no mulch).
Using partial budget analysis in a farm context, the hairy vetch mulch treatment was more profitable in all years under all market and yield adjustment scenarios.
The vetch mulch system also was the preferred system for a risk-averse grower, according to a safety-first criterion.
The combination of environmental benefits and the economic benefits to the grower make the hairy vetch mulch system an attractive alternative for producing fresh-market tomatoes in the Mid-Atlantic and parts of northeastern United States.

Demand for organic produce soared as a consequence of these events, and mainstream supermarkets began adding more organic produce to their traditional product lines.
But when organic supplies proved scarce, and as prices increased, consumer purchases decreased and many marketing managers began to question the rationality of allocating scarce shelf space to organic products.
In fact many supermarket chains either drastically reduced their organic offerings or dropped them altogether.
Some analysts proclaimed that organics had failed the market test.
However, two surveys we carried out in 1989 and 1991 among major California supermarket chains show that forecasts of the demise of organic produce in mainstream markets may have been premature.
Of 16 chains responding to our survey, 12 continue to carry organic produce.
All had carried organics for more than six months, two-thirds of them for more than a year.
Of the 12 that carry organics, six rate organics as worse overall than conventional produce.
But interestingly, six rate organics as "about the same" as conventional-produce.
This is a significant achievement for organics.
Organics rated better on environmental impact and residues, worse on appearance and shelf life, and "about the same" on flavor and nutritive value.
Despite the constraints and difficulties encountered in marketing organic foods, 8 of the 12 chains that carry organics would carry more organic fruits and vegetables if supplies were available.
The prospects for certified "pesticide free" produce are less definite.

Descriptors: tomatoes; fresh products; organic foods; opinions; buying prices; regional surveys; food quality; keeping quality; case studies; consumer preferences; middle atlantic states of usa; opinion survey; conjoint survey Abstract: A survey of professional tomato buyers indicated that handlers and nonhandlers of organic tomatoes had common perceptions of the organic market and its limitations.
Both groups identified the following factors as constraining the organic market: low demands by consumers and retailers, uncertainties about organic labeling, short supplies of organics, and the discard rate of organics.
However, handlers and nonhandlers differed in their opinions about quality consistency and appearance.
As the buyers' preferences for organic tomatoes increased, the importance of shelf life, discard rate, quality consistency, and appearance in constraining the organic market lessened.
The survey also showed that nonhandlers would pay substantially less for organic tomatoes than for conventional tomatoes, even when all other attributes were the same.

(1996) Includes references.
Descriptors: organic foods; distribution; systems; domestic markets; cooperative marketing; supermarkets; supply balance; organic farming; denmark Abstract: In 1993, a breakthrough occurred for sales of organic food products in conventional supermarkets in Denmark.
Since then, sales have increased markedly and consumers now have a choice between organic and conventional food products in nearly all supermarkets.
This success owes much to the intense efforts of three main groups since the mid-1980s.
First, organic farmers have increased production and successfully managed economic and organizational problems.
Second, the Danish State has supported sales of organic products and farmers' conversion to organic farming by supporting marketing and product innovation and by organizing producers.
Third, the largest Danish supermarket chain has contributed by its steady demand for organic products since 1981.
Today, all major supermarkets in Denmark are supplied by conventional distributors that handle the products of small organic producer organizations.
For nearly two years the system has kept up the positive effects of a market expansion process that was initiated by a major advertising campaign and a modest drop in consumer prices.

Descriptors: food industry; organic foods; marketing; northern ireland; irish republic Abstract: Describes the current status of the organic food market in Ireland--current trading arrangements of wholesalers, distributors and retailers and the perceptions of organic food at different stages of the marketing chain.
There are three certification bodies for organic foods in Ireland.
The value of the market is estimated at 1.5 million IR pounds.
Fruit and vegetables are the most important organic foods.
Other organic foods are available such as flour, grains, breakfast cereals, meat, yogurt and cheese.
Organic foods can be purchased in some of the larger supermarkets, in healthfood/wholefood shops, at local markets or at farm gate.
Some of the constraints to development of the industry are limited range and supply of products.
Premium levels are also a constraint on development as consumers generally perceive organic products to be too expensive.
Reports premiums charged on organic food and outlines the results of a focus group on organic foods.

Descriptors: organic foods; fruit; vegetables; purchasing habits; correlation; consumer attitudes; food safety; pesticide residues; health hazards; food prices; food quality; insects; consumer surveys; questionnaires; consumer preferences; organic farming; sustainability; food cooperatives; new york Abstract: We surveyed shoppers at a food cooperative in New York state to measure the relationship between organic produce purchases and attitudes related to pesticide use in agriculture, food costs, and other factors affecting produce buying.
Two-fifths of the co-op shoppers surveyed usually or almost always purchased organically grown produce, and one-third were somewhat or very likely to pay 100 percent more than conventional produce for residue-free produce.
Those who usually or almost always purchased organic produce were less concerned than other shoppers about price when they shop for produce, had higher levels of concern about food safety, and were less concerned about insects and surface blemishes on produce.
There was no relationship between income and frequency of organic purchases.
Most shoppers were concerned about pesticide residues in produce, but a high level of concern appeared necessary to affect the frequency of organic purchases.
In their support of organic agriculture, respondents ranked environmental protection higher than consumer protection.
Educators should emphasize both the environmental and food safety benefits of organic farming to consumers.

(1995) Includes references.
Descriptors: organic foods; purchasing habits; consumer behavior; household income; dietary surveys; environmental protection; adolescents; men; women; northern ireland Abstract: A series of studies, conducted over the period 1989 to 1993, based on actual purchasing patterns, seeks to quantify the extent of purchase of organic food and the consumer's commitment.
The most commonly expressed motives for purchasing organic food have become consideration for the environment and health reasons.
Availability and price are the chief factors which inhibit the purchase of organic food.
A profile of actual purchasers of organic produce shows them to be female aged 30-45, with children and having a higher level of disposable income.
This research has demonstrated that the primary factor in organic food purchase is the consumer's level of personal disposable income.
There would appear to be a distinction between those who claim to be interested in the environment and those who regularly buy organic products.
