TSA Identifies the 42 Airports Participating in "Selectee Checkpoint" Program to Consolidate Screening and Reduce Passenger Delays New Program Requires Boarding Passes and IDs Prior to Security Checkpoint
Under Secretary of Transportation for Security Adm. James M. Loy today listed 42 airports that are participating in the Transportation Security Administration's "Selectee Checkpoint" pilot program.
The program will enhance security and convenience by transferring the screening of selectees from aircraft boarding gates to security checkpoints where screening equipment and personnel are concentrated.
This move follows announcements last week by Admiral Loy that TSA is implementing a number of enhanced security procedures in anticipation of the busy holiday travel season, including rescinding the 300-foot parking restrictions, linking new parking security to current threat levels and enhancing the secondary screening process.
Passengers traveling through airports with the "Selectee Checkpoint" program in place will experience the bulk of screening at the checkpoint, where security personnel and screening equipment are concentrated.
Checkpoints at these airports have been reconfigured to channel selectees through a special lane.
