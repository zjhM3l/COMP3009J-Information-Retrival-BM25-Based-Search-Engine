Abstract: Two-year-old red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) seedlings were grown in a poorly buffered soil from a high-elevation site in the Great Smoky Mountains and exposed for 16 weeks to acid mist and rain chemically similar to that occurring at high- elevation sites in the southern Appalachian Mountains.
Measurements of seedling growth, root distribution, saturated net photosynthesis, dark respiration, and nutrient content were made to test the hypothesis that acid deposition had caused reductions in the carbon economy noted at high-elevation sites in previous field studies.
The role of base cation depletion in these changes was examined by evaluating soil amendments of Ca, Mg, or Ca plus Mg. Acidified rain and mist reduced (i) the apparent carbon economy of foliage, (ii) seedling growth, and (iii) rooting depth in these controlled greenhouse studies.
Changes in gas exchange physiology paralleled responses observed for sapling trees in the field with increasing elevation and included both reduced net photosynthesis and increased dark respiration.
Calcium deficiency induced by acid deposition is apparently an important mechanism underlying physiological responses of red spruce previously observed in the field.
Calcium addition to soil partially reduced the effects of acid deposition, but observed responses suggest that both foliar- and soil-driven reactions are involved.
Changes in carbon metabolism associated with reduced Ca availability, when high levels of acid deposition are superimposed on poorly buffered soils, support the inferential association of acid deposition with growth decline of mature red spruce in high- elevation forests of the Appalachian Mountains.

Abstract: Red spruce seedlings growing in open top chambers in a nutrient-poor medium were exposed to mists containing one of five different combinations of H+, SO4(2-), NO3(-) and NH4+ ions, three at pH 5.6 and two at pH 2.5.
The mists were applied twice weekly from May until November, and the plants overwintered outdoors with no additional mist treatment.
Seedlings that received mists containing sulphate (1.6 mol m(-3)) the previous growing season were more frost-hardy (i.e., their dehardening was delayed) the following April than seedlings that received lower concentrations of sulphate or none.
Neither ammonium nor nitrate in the applied mist had any effect on dehardening, but they did advance budburst when applied together.
In the presence of sulphate there was no effect of ammonium-N on the time of budburst.
Exposure to mists containing nitrogen significantly increased the dry weight and length of the leading shoots that emerged from the buds and extended the following summer.
There was no evidence that the stimulatory effects of nitrogen on growth made the seedlings less frost-hardy in spring.

Abstract: The release of orthophosphate ions from organic compounds is essential for continuous phosphorus cycling in forest ecosystem.
An important stage of this process in coniferous forests of the temperate zone is the production of acid phosphomonoesterase (PME) by ectomycorrhizal fungi.
The effect of artificial and natural pollutant inputs during repeated short periods of high concentration on the activity of the specific enzyme was studied.
The acid PME activity of spruce mycorrhizas was used as an indicator of anthropogenic pressure on forest soils.
The seasonal dynamics of the activity of acid PME was monitored from February 1989 to January 1990.
The results have showed a significant decrease of acid PME activity in ectomycorrhizal spruce roots as affected by pollutant input.
The amount of acid PME activity may become one of the characteristic of the changing biochemical processes in soils under the effects of air pollution.
The method presented is simple enough to be included in an integrated system of ecological analysis routinely used in field research to monitor forest decline.

Abstract: Elemental composition data were obtained for bulk precipitation and throughfall samples and for aqueous extracts of the leaves of three woody plant species common in the subalpine Sierra Nevada range, California: chinquapin (Chrysolepis sempervirens Hjelmqvist), western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl.), and willow (Salix orestera Schneider).
The acid-base equilibria of the extracts were characterized by potentiometric titration and proton formation functions were computed.
The latter then were modeled assuming four classes of quasiparticle acidic functional groups, yielding negative logarithms of conditional protonation constants in the range 4.8 to 5.0, 6.1 to 6.6, 7.4 to 7.7, and 9.1 to 9.4.
The relative concentration of a given acidic functional group class varied markedly among the three woody species, but the conditional protonation constants were very similar.
The model parameters, along with dissolved organic C concentration and pH values, were used to estimate net anion deficits in throughfall samples collected from the same sites as the leaf samples.
On average, the calculated charge concentration of free organic anions in the western white pine extract matched the throughfall anion deficit, whereas the deficits in the chinquapin and willow throughfall samples were not accounted for by free anion concentrations.
Metal complexation and in situ, species-dependent leaf surface processes may account for these latter differences.
In general, the anion deficit and, therefore, organic acids were an important component of rainfall and throughfall charge balance.

Abstract: Acute effects of high-nitrate/low-sulfate acidic fogs with a pH of 2.5 and 3.0 were investigated on 3.5- to 4-week-old Phaseolus lunatus L. in a series of replicated trials.
After 24 hours, CO2 assimilation rates of primary leaves were reduced by at least one-third by 3-hour fogs with a pH value of 2.5 as compared to control plants treated with a fog of pH 6.3.
A 3-hour fog at pH 3.0 reduced CO2 assimilation a minimum of 20%.
Stomatal resistance increased in primary leaves of plants exposed to an acidic fog of pH 2.5 by 
Stomatal resistances in leaves exposed to pH 3.0 fogs increased at least 27%.
However, internal CO2 concentrations were not significantly different between control- and acid-fogged plants at any pH.
Standardizing plants for similar CO2 assimilation rates allowed statistical separation of photosynthetically important variables as compared to unstandardized experimental designs with higher interplant variability.
Methacrylate plastic sections of foliar lesions resulting from exposure to pH 2.0 fogs revealed that damage usually progressed vertically from the upper to lower epidermis.
Xylem was less susceptible to damage than other tissues.

Abstract: Direct or indirect Al toxicity has been suggested as a principal factor in forest tree declines.
We monitored ambient soil solutions in undisturbed and experimentally manipulated soils from a fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.]-spruce forest on Whiteface Mountain, NY, in order to characterize soil solution Al concentrations over a range of acid anion loadings.
Under both natural and experimental conditions total Al and labile Al concentrations rarely exceeded values (180-250 micromole L-1) associated with reduced root growth in red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.).
Over a 2-yr period ambient soil solutions averaged 76 and 46 micromole L-1 total Al in the organic and mineral horizons, respectively.
The highest monthly mean concentrations occurred in winter.
Disturbance-induced NO3 accumulation and simulated acid rain applications produced higher peak Al values in experimental plots than were observed in undisturbed and untreated plots.
Although soils of the fir-spruce zone exhibited the potential to yield solutions with phytotoxic Al concentrations, it appears that such concentrations are both spatially and temporally limited and infrequently present a direct stress to root growth in red spruce.

Abstract: A whole-watershed manipulation project was begun on the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA, in 1987, with the objective of increasing understanding of the effects of acidic deposition on forest ecosystems.
Two treatment watersheds (WS9 and WS3) and one control watershed (WS4) were included.
Treatments were twice-ambient N and S deposition, applied via NH4SO4 fertilizer, with three applications per year.
Three years of pretreatment data were collected and used for calibration.
Stream water chemistry data collected during 3 years of treatment were evaluated.
Stream water pH and electrical conductivity were not significantly affected by the elevated N and S inputs on either treatment watershed.
On WS9, there were no statistically significant treatment effects on stream water export of Ca, SO4, or NO3 On WS3, however, stream export of both NO3 and Ca have increased as a result of acidification treatments.
The implications of these results are discussed.
Research is continuing so that the processes involved may be elucidated.
In addition, effects on vegetation, aquatic invertebrates and amphibians also are being evaluated.

Abstract: Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) seedlings growing outside in open-top chambers were sprayed twice weekly with artificial mists at either pH 2.5 or 5.6, for five months during the 1988 growing season.
The mists contained one of the following: (water, pH 5.6 (control); (NH4)2SO4, pH 5.6; NH4NO3, pH 5.6; HNO3, pH 2.5; H2SO4, pH 2.5; or (NH4)2SO4 + NH4NO3, pH 2.5.
During January 1989, the light responses of assimilation and stomatal conductance were assessed in the laboratory following a 4-day equilibration at 12 degrees C.
The aerial portions of the intact trees were then subjected to a mild (-10 degrees C) frost for three hours during the night and the rate of recovery of light-saturated assimilation (Amax) was determined the following day using the same branches as were used for the assimilation studies before the frost treatment.
The same trees were then subjected to a second frost of -18 degrees C for three hours during the following night and the recovery of Amax of the same branches was measured the next day.
All of the acid mist treatments increased Amax and apparent quantum yield relative to the control treatment when measured before the frost treatments.
Frosts of -10 and -18 degrees C resulted in a significant decline in Amax of seedlings in all treatments except the control.
Stomatal conductance increased with increasing irradiance in seedlings in the acid mist treatments that did not contain SO4(2- ) ion.
Stomatal conductance of seedlings in acid mist treatments containing SO4(2-) ion was insensitive to changes in irradiance over the range 50-1500 micromoles m-2 s-1.
It is concluded that acid precipitation increased the sensitivity of the assimilation response to midwinter frosts that follow a brief warm period.
The SO4(2-) ion appears to be significant in causing increased sensitivity to frost and in causing stomatal insensitivity to light flux density.

Abstract: Many studies that address the impact of tropospheric O3 on agricultural and forested ecosystems utilize the open-top chamber.
During the production of O3 using electrical discharge generators fed with dry air, there is an inadvertent addition of HNO3 vapor, a highly reactive trace gas.
While several studies have proposed that HNO3 vapor introduces artifacts, none has measured concentrations of the odd-N2 trace gas in the chamber or investigated the fate of the N in the context of whole-plant physiology and growth.
These questions were investigated using open-top chambers containing seedlings of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) during the 1988 growing season in Oak Ridge, TN.
The O2 treatments consisted of charcoal-filtered or subambient (0.96 micromoles m-3, 24-h mean), ambient (1.62 micromoles m-3, 24-h mean), and elevated (2.36 micromoles m-3, 24-h mean) concentrations, the last being accomplished by proportional O3 addition over the diurnal period.
Measurements of the HNO3 vapor concentration during dry periods only (no rainfall or ground- level fog) averaged 28.6 nmol m-3 (subambient), 55.4 nmol m-3 (ambient air), and 240.0 nmol m-3 (elevated O3), an 8.4-fold range.
For every 100 mol of O3 added to the chamber, 28 mol of HNO3 vapor were inadvertently added; this ratio is several times higher than that previously reported.
This result, taken with published estimates of leaf conductance to HNO3 vapor, indicates a maximum N deposition in the form of HNO3 vapor ranging from 19.5 pmol N cm-2 leaf area h-1 (subambient O3) to 171.9 pmol N cm-2 h-1 (elevated O3).
Given the nutrient content of the seedlings and knowledge of the fate of HNO3 vapor on the leaf surface and leaf interior, the degree to which N deposition via HNO3 vapor met the N requirements of the loblolly pine seedlings was estimated.
Seedlings in the elevated treatment had an upper- limit estimate of 3.5% for the needles and 1.8% for the whole plant of N derived from HNO3 vapor.

Abstract: Incident precipitation, throughfall and stemflow were collected to examine the importance of factors potentially determining net canopy element fluxes, and to quantify canopy exchange and dry deposition rates in a regenerating southern Appalachian forest.
Net throughfall fluxes (throughfall minus precipitation transfers) showed consistent canopy effects on rainfall chemistry, with SO4(2-), PO4(3-), Cl(-), K(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) added to rainfall by foliage, whereas NO3(-)-N, NH4(+)-N and H(+) ions were absorbed from precipitation.
Storm characteristics (event amount and duration) accounted for the largest portion of the variability in growing season net throughfall fluxes, suggesting that canopy exchange was the major mechanism of throughfall transfer.
Stemflow fluxes increased canopy exchange rates of SO4(2-), PO4(3-), Cl(-), K(+), and Mg(2+) by greater than 20% in a regression model of total below- canopy element fluxes.
Cation leaching fluxes were highly variable (C.V. 
Foliar cation leaching losses in the early successional forest accounted for 4-13% of leaf nutrient reserves.
As cation throughfall transfers were highest during storms with the greatest hydrogen ion uptake from rainwater, it is hypothesized that acid precipitation is causing accelerated foliar nutrient leaching in south-eastern hardwood forests.

Abstract: Under experimental conditions, the growth of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) is often responsive to ozone at near- ambient concentrations.
However, little is known of the biochemical changes associated with this or other pollutants.
Loblolly pine seedlings in open-top chambers were exposed to combinations of ozone (sub-ambient, ambient, or twice-ambient), acidic precipitation (pH 3.8 or pH 5.2) and soil magnesium (0.15 or 0.32 microgram g-1 exchangeable Mg) for three growing seasons.
The effects of these treatments were greater in foliage than in stems or roots.
The largest treatment effect was a 50% decrease in the starch concentration of current-year foliage from the twice-ambient ozone treatment compared with current-year foliage from the sub-ambient ozone treatment.
Responses to ozone were consistent with the hypothesis that ozone-induced growth reductions are associated with depletion of carbohydrate reserves resulting from injury compensation and repair processes or reduced carbon fixation or both.
Addition of acidic precipitation, and to a small extent Mg, decreased sugar concentrations of tissues; however, this effect appeared to be mediated by nutrient addition rather than by acidity per se.
Given the role of carbohydrates in plant resistance to environmental stress, the sensitivity of carbohydrates to experimental treatments demonstrates the potential for indirect effects of ozone, acidic precipitation, and soil properties on stress resistance.
Non-carbohydrate constituents were largely unresponsive to the experimental treatments.
These findings imply that tissue carbohydrate analysis may be useful for assessing the impacts of pollutants in forest ecosystems.

Abstract: The investigation of the effects of atmospheric pollution on metabolism and growth of woody species has long been hampered by the very difficult task of exposing mature individuals to controlled environments of air pollutants.
This paper describes the design, construction, and testing of an alternative tool to whole-tree enclosures for measuring pollution response in mature woody tissue.
The chamber is a new design, though not a new concept, and is referred to as a branch exposure chamber.
Designed primarily for ozone and acid precipitation exposures (and used additionally for CO2 measurements), the branch exposure chamber incorporates four major parts: support structure, fan-air supply unit, charcoal filter unit, and exposure chamber.
The exposure chamber is a 1.5-m long by 0.7-m diam. cylinder.
The chamber is constructed of Teflon sheeting stretched over an aluminum frame; the aluminum frame is totally wrapped with nonreactive, aluminum-backed Teflon tape.
Three zones in the chamber affect exposure of the experimental tissue: an initial buffer region for mixing, a main exposure region, and an exhaust frustrum.
Aerodynamic testing of the chamber-mixing characteristics show that mixing is uniform and complete within the main exposure region.
Thermal buildup within the chamber was a maximum of 3 degrees C under a wide range of ambient meteorological conditions.
Based on current field trials of the chamber, material deterioration due to environmental variables (e.g., ultraviolet radiation, heat oxidants), is not expected to affect operation of the chamber for 24 mo.
The BEC is inexpensive to build and operate, and represents a viable alternative to a whole-tree chamber.

Abstract: The effects of acid rain and ozone exposure on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings in the Piedmont of North Carolina were assessed over two exposure seasons (1987-1988).
Direct effects and carryover effects of long-term exposure on the photosynthetic potential and photopigment concentrations of different needle age-classes were studied.
Three half-sib families were grown in open-top field chambers and exposed to two acid rain treatments (pH 5.3 or 3.3) and five ozone exposures delivered in proportion to ambient concentrations (0.5X to 3.0X ambient) in a complete factorial design.
Ozone significantly affected photosynthesis but there were no statistically significant effects of acid rain nor any ozone X acid rain interactions.
In 1987, photosynthesis of the 1987 first-flush progressively diverged among the ozone treatments except between charcoal-filtered (CF approximately 0.5X ambient) and nonfiltered air (NF).
At the end of the first season, photosynthesis was reduced 24% at 1.5X compared to CF and more than 80% at 2.25X and 3.0X.
Chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations were similarly reduced at elevated ozone exposures.
In 1988, photosynthesis of the 1987 first-flush in the elevated ozone treatments remained lower.
Early in the second season, the 1988 first-flush had a 25% to 50% lower photosynthetic potential at 2.25X and 3.0X compared to CF.
This carryover effect on the photosynthetic potential before significant cumulative exposure was progressively smaller in the later 1988 flushes.
In the late season flushes in the highest ozone treatments, photosynthesis was significantly higher than in the lower ozone treatments.

Abstract: Ionic concentrations and fluxes were measured for 2 years in five northern hardwood stands along an acidic deposition gradient that extends from northern Minnesota (lowest deposition) to southeastern Michigan (highest deposition).
Precipitation fluxes of H+, SO4(2-), and NO3- were, respectively, 340, 69, and 83% greater at the site with the highest deposition than at the site with the lowest deposition.
No significant differences among sites were evident for precipitation fluxes of cations along the gradient.
Fluxes of H+, SO4(2-), NO3-, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in throughfall increased along the gradient and were positively correlated with increased atmospheric inputs of H+, SO4(2-), and NO3- measured at the sites.
Fluxes of SO4(2-) and NO3- in throughfall were greater than precipitation fluxes, indicating dry deposition in excess of any assimilation of these anions from precipitation.
Dry deposition inputs of SO4(2-) increased from the northwestern to southeastern sites and were estimated to range from 23 to 49% of precipitation inputs.
Precipitation acidity was neutralized by the canopy in all stands, but the amount of H+ retained by the canopy was significantly greater at sites with the greatest precipitation acidity.
Throughfall fluxes of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in excess of precipitation fluxes were positively correlated with the canopy retention and deposition of H+ along the gradient.
Increased throughfall fluxes of these cations were consistent with hypothesized increases in canopy leaching of cations with increased acidic deposition.
Increased canopy leaching of Ca2+ and Mg2+, resulting from elevated acidic deposition, was estimated to represent as much as 6.2 and 12.9% of foliar contents of these cations, respectively.
Although HCO3- and organic anions were found to play an important role in maintaining electroneutrality in throughfall along the gradient, strong acid anions increasingly dominated anionic composition of throughfall with increasing acidic deposition.

Abstract: Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) seedlings grown in open-top chambers were exposed to several combinations of ozone (near zero, ambient, 1.7 X ambient, or 2.5 X ambient) in conjunction with acid rain (pH 3.3, 4.3, or 5.3) starting in August 1988.
Needle samples from the first (89-1) and third (89-3) flushes of the 1989 growing season were analyzed for their glucose, sucrose, total reducing sugars, and starch contents.
For the 89-1 flush (current-year needles), no differences in glucose, sucrose, or starch contents were observed among the various ozone exposures during 1989.
However, needles exposed to 2.5 X ambient ozone exhibited higher levels of total reducing sugars compared with other ozone exposures for most of 1989.
High H+ concentration (pH 3.3) increased glucose content (compared with pH 4.3 or 5.3) in the September sampling only.
No significant differences were observed among ozone treatments for the total reducing sugars, glucose, or starch contents of the 89-3 flush (previous-year needles) for most of the sampling periods in 1990.
However, the sucrose content was lower in needles receiving 2.5 X ambient ozone compared with other ozone exposures.
Although high H+ concentration (pH 3.3) appeared to affect some carbohydrate components, there was no general trend observed.

Abstract: Decomposing needle and leaf litter, from a pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand and a mixed deciduous woodland, respectively, were exposed to arithmetic mean SO2 concentrations of up to 50 nl l-1 (mm3 m-3) in controlled field-based experiments lasting up to 215 d.
The objectives of the study were: (1) to evaluate whether SO2 concentrations, known to occur in parts of Europe, could alter the chemical composition of forest litter and leachates, and (2) to use such information to complement results obtained during microbiological studies (Wookey et al., 1991).
Dry deposition of SO2 on the litter resulted in the production of sulphate during damp conditions or when the litter was moist.
The formation of SO4(-2) and associated H+ ions led to cation exchange processes whereby Mg2+ and Ca2+ in particular were leached from the litter.
This resulted in significant (P 
Incomplete buffering by base cations resulted in acidification of leachates.
The magnitude of cation leaching and depletion within the litter was not always linearly related to SO2 or leachate SO4(-2) concentrations, and the role of microbial processes and litter quality as modifiers of such responses is considered.

Abstract: The comparative phosphorus (P) requirement of different annual pasture legume species was measured in seven field experiments in south-western Australia.
Superphosphate was applied once only, at the start of each experiment.
The duration of the experiments was from one to three years.
The amount of P required to produce 90% of the maximum yield of each legume was used to estimate the comparative P requirements of the legumes at each harvest.
Ornithopus spp. (O. compressus, O. perpusillus and O. pinnatus) required less P than Trifolium subterraneum, the most widely sown pasture legume in Western Australia.
The P requirements of Medicago polymorpha varied with soil type when compared to that of T. subterraneum, M. polymorpha required less P on a soil with a neutral pH value, but had a similar P requirement on a more acidic soil.
M. murex, generally required more P than T. subterraneum.
In some experiments, the comparative P requirement of the different legumes varied for different harvests.
At each harvest in each experiment, the relationship between yield and P concentration in tissue (internal efficiency curves) usually differed for different legumes.
Presumably different legumes take up P from the soil at different rates within each harvest, and utilize the absorbed P differently to produce herbage and seed.
The exceptions were that similar internal efficiency curves were measured for O. compressus and T. subterraneum in one experiment, and three cultivars of O. compressus in another experiment.

Abstract: High-elevation ecosystems in the western USA are potentially susceptible to increased inputs of strong acids.
A long-term research project was established to identify the processes controlling surface water chemistry and to evaluate the sensitivity of Loch Vale Watershed in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, to acid precipitation.
Using lysimeters, we estimated the concentration and flux of major solutes in the Oie and B horizons in an old-grown Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) and subalpine fir [Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.)
Nutt.] forest, and in an adjacent site disturbed by a snow avalanche.
In the forested site, most solutes were highly concentrated in soil solutions during the initial stages of snowmelt, and concentrations declined rapidly to low levels in the first 4 to 6 wk of snowmelt.
Surface water chemistry in Loch Vale Watershed is controlled principally by mineral weathering.
During the early stages of snowmelt, however, the flushing of solutes, especially N, S, and C, from forest soils (which comprise only 6% of the study area) exerts an important influence.
Rates of cationic denudation per unit area were 3.5 times higher in the forest (131 micromoles(c) m-2 yr-1) than in the whole watershed (38 micromoles(c) m-2 yr-1) probably because of H+ exudation from roots during nutrient uptake and the generation of organic acids in the forest soils.
Rates of N mineralization and nitrification as well as concentrations of NO3 in the soil solution were higher in the second year after forest disturbance from a snow avalanche than immediately following the disturbance, indicating a delayed nitrification response.
Significant amounts of NH4 and NO3 were temporarily stored in extractable forms in the soil during the first year after the disturbance.
Although precipitation inputs and theoretical mineral weathering can explain the total annual solute flux from Loch Vale Watershed, the effects of forest soil solutes may be important during the initial stages of snowmelt and following large-scale disturbance.

Abstract: Curly shaped needles developed on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings grown in lysimeters in two greenhouse studies.
Nearly 90% of the seedlings from five half-sib families developed curly needles when watered weekly with one of four acid rain solutions.
No abnormal needles developed on seedlings from the same seed lots growing on an adjacent bench and watered daily.
In a second study, curly needles developed within 2 weeks after seedlings were transplanted into the lysimeters.
Weekly misting of the foliage significantly reduced the proportion of fascicles with curly needles.
Results indicate that curly needle syndrome is induced by water stress during needle elongation and suggest that wetting the foliage decreases the strength of the fascicle sheaths.

Abstract: Annual nutrient fluxes within two forests exposed to acidic deposition were compared for a 1-year period.
Calcium (Ca 2+) was the dominant cation in throughfall and soil solutions from tolerant hardwood dominated Spodosols (Podzols) at both Huntington Forest (HF), New York, and the Turkey Lakes watershed (TLW), Ontario.
There was a net annual export of Ca 2+ and Mg2+ from the TLW soil, whereas base cation inputs in precipitation equaled outputs at HF.
In 1986, leaching losses of base cations were five times greater at TLW than at HF.
A higher percentage of the base cation reserves was leached from the soil at TLW (5%) than at HF (1%).
Relative to throughfall, aluminum concentrations increased in forest-floor and mineral-soil solutions, especially at HF.
The TLW soil appears more sensitive to soil acidification.
Deposited atmospheric acidity, however, was small in comparison with native soil acidity (total and exchangeable) and the reserves of base cations in each soil.
Soil acidity and base saturation, therefore, are likely only to change slowly.

Abstract: Emission of sulphur dioxide (SO2) takes place in Alberta from tall stacks at natural sour gas or oil sands processing plants.
The local quantities of sulphur (S) deposition on soil and any resulting soil acidification are poorly known.
The main objective was to quantify S deposited by wet and dry deposition at distances from a large emitter (135 t SO2-S day-1) and determine the effect on soil pH.
Crushed soil samples were set in containers under rain shelters without walls at sites varying in distance from the source (4 to 173 km).
After 4 months a sandy soil had accumulated 24 kg total S ha-1 when comparing the nearest and farthest sites, but the value was only 4 kg ha-1 for an organic soil.
During 5 months in the next year, lichen over a thin layer of sandy soil accumulated 3.5 kg total S ha-1.
The three soils had slight but significant pH decreases near the source, and they all had much less sulphate compared to total S increase.
Lysimeters were set at 9 sites for a 17-month period and wet deposition of S near the SO2 emitter was 
A sandy Brunisol had an estimated 19 kg total S ha-1 increase by dry deposition while there was an increase of 56 kg for a sandy loam Luvisol when comparing the site nearest the emitter to the most remote.
In all, dry S deposition in the vicinity of the S source was approximately 5 to 70 times greater than the S deposition in rain and snow.
Dry deposition S was found mostly as total S instead of sulphate and slight decreases in soil pH occurred.
In the laboratory, four ground soils were exposed to an air stream containing 185 micrograms SO2 m-3 of SO2 for 30 days in a 0.15 m3 chamber.
The soils sorbed from 23 to 77 micrograms sulphate-S g-1 soil with slight pH depression.
In a similar experiment, blocks of intact lichen (5 cm deep) over sand (2.5 cm deep) received an air stream with 265 micrograms SO2 m-3 for 7 days.
The soil layers retained 2.6 kg total S ha-1 with little of it as sulphate.

Abstract: Atmospheric pollutants including acidic rain and ozone (O3), are widespread in the Southeastern United States.
Acidic rain and 03 are known to suppress tree growth and crop yields.
The objective of this study was to determine the effect of acidic rain and O3 on soil and plant secondary needle nutrients.
Seedlings of loblolly pine, Family 24.4, (moderately sensitive to 03) were exposed to 5 levels of O3 (0, 80, 160, 240, and 320 ppb) and 3 simulated acidic rain (SAR) pH (3.3, 4.3, and 5.3) treatments for 11 weeks.
Significant O3 effects on NO3; SAR effects on NO3, total N, Mg, K and PO4; and SAR X O3 interaction effects on NO3 were observed.
Soil Ca was not significantly affected by any of the treatments.
The P content in 2 degrees needles was not significantly changed by O3.
The Ca and Mg contents in secondary needles were significantly affected by O3 concentration with 25% and 24% decreases in content, respectively, as the O3 concentration increased from 160 to 320 ppb.
Simulated acidic rain caused significant leaching or loss of soil NO3, PO4, K, and Mg. __________________________________________________________________

Abstract: The adsorption of acifluorfen, the sodium salt of 5- [2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-2-nitrobenzoic acid, on six soils of various physical and chemical properties as well as its dependence on the exchangeable cation (Ca 2+ and Na+) and on soil pH was studied.
Adsorption isotherms conformed to the Freundlich equation.
Soil saturation by Na+ ions produced a strong decrease in acifluorfen adsorption, whereas the opposite finding was observed for Ca-saturated soils.
Adsorption was found to be correlated with cation-exchange capacity (CEC) much better than with other soil properties and decreased with increasing pH.
At comparable pH, variations of kf values after Ca saturation of soils indicated that complex formation reactions, leading to precipitation of insoluble complexes, contribute to simulate high adsorption.

Abstract: Three headwater source areas were identified within a strongly acidified forest catchment in the Llyn Brianne area of central Wales.
Each received an aerial application of between 10 and 16 t ha-1 of limestone pellets (composed of powdered chalk, starch and bentonite) in November 1988.
The pH, calcium and aluminium levels within soil water and stream water were assessed at fortnightly intervals over a 3 year period to determine the impact of the treatment on drainage water acidity.
The results demonstrated the importance of identifying the effective source areas within a catchment and treating these with a readily available form of powdered limestone.
Treatment with a pelletised form was unsuccessful in eliminating periods of low pH and high aluminium concentrations within the headwaters of the forested catchment.
This was attributed to the slow breakdown and dissolution of the limestone pellets under the forest canopy and the reduced importance of the surface runoff pathways owing to pre-afforestation cultivation and drainage, and soil drying by the forest crop.

Abstract: Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) seedlings in 24 open-top chambers were exposed to combinations of ozone (carbon- filtered (control), ambient, 1.7 X ambient, and 2.5 X ambient) and acidic precipitation (pH 5.3, 4.3 and 3.3) for 16 months (1989 harvest) or 28 months (1990 harvest).
Although the effects of acid rain were generally not significant, there was a trend toward increased aboveground biomass and leaf area in seedlings subjected to the low pH treatments.
Because N concentrations in the soils generally increased with decreasing pH, we concluded that the effects of acid rain on aboveground biomass and leaf area were a consequence of an increasing concentration of soil N.
In the 1989 harvest, seedlings in the 2.5 X ambient ozone treatment had significantly less biomass in all aboveground plant components and significantly less total leaf area than seedlings in the 1.7 X ambient ozone treatment.
In the 1990 harvest, there were no significant effects of ozone on total aboveground biomass, although there was a trend toward reduced biomass in seedlings in the 2.5 X ambient ozone treatment.
Both total leaf area and leaf biomass were significantly less in seedlings exposed to 2.5 X ambient ozone for 28 months than in both control seedlings and seedlings in the 1.7 X ambient ozone treatment.
The greater, but not always significant, aboveground biomass and leaf area of seedlings in the 1.7 X ambient ozone treatment compared with control seedlings may be associated with the observed increase in soil nitrate concentration as a result of increased rates of leaf senescence and litterfall.

Abstract: The effects of rain acidity on field-grown 'Summerred' apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh) under natural conditions were investigated.
One group of four trees was exposed to ambient rainfall.
Four other groups were covered with rainshields and received water, pH 5.6, 4, and 3, respectively, as simulated rain.
Simulated acid rain, particularly at pH 3, adversely affected fruit production in terms of individual fruit weight, fruit set, fruit appearance (necrosis and russetting of the peel) and dry weight.
Ambient rain was not found to cause significant reductions in apple fruit production in this study.

and Cornus florida L. were collected before and after seven rains, washed, and analyzed for concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+. Leaf rinse water and the inorganic composition of each rain were also analyzed.
All samples were collected in Indianapolis, Indiana, during June-September 1986-1987.
Rain pH ranged from 3.6 to 4.6, volumes from 0.1 to 1.9 cm, and durations from 1 to 16 h. Most rains were net cleansers of leaf surfaces; concentrations of cations, SO4(-2), and NO3(-) in leaf rinse water were generally higher pre- than post-rain, or were unchanged by rain exposures, and leaf rinse water was more acidic after rains.
Pre- versus post-rain changes in cation concentrations in washed leaves were generally small (+/-7%) compared with amounts present in leaves, and few differences were statistically significant (most p 
The changes in foliar cation concentrations were not correlated with rain pH, duration, volume, or date.
These results suggest that short-term exposure to rain with pH typical of rain in much of the eastern United States is unlikely to have direct effects on foliar nutrient status, at least on fertile soils.

Abstract: Concentrations of total, total monomeric and organic monomeric forms of aluminium and of iron, anions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams draining one forested and two moorland catchments in southwest Scotland were measured over a 3- year period.
Catchments were limed during the study and comparisons of stream chemistry were made before and after liming under the two land-use types.
Within individual events, DOC and anion concentrations increased with increasing discharge, and aluminium concentrations showed little change with discharge.
In the pre-liming phase as a whole, organic monomeric Al was strongly correlated with DOC and inorganic monomeric Al was strongly correlated with anions, particularly Cl.
The forested catchment had higher mean DOC and SO4, but lower mean Al.
After liming, Al concentrations were reduced, by up to 80% for monomeric forms, and these low levels prevented observation of correlations with DOC and anions.
Liming treatments were effective in both forested and moorland catchments, lasted for at least 2.5 years after treatment, and low rates of application to bog areas were as effective as entire catchment treatments.

Abstract: The acidity of ambient rainfall and its effect on soil and plants is a growing concern.
Glass microelectrodes were consumed and used to investigate the effect of soil pH and foliar application of acid rain on the rhizosphere pH of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. Arrow), corn (Zea mays L. cv. B73 X MO17), and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Williams 82].
Plant roots were grown in minirhizotrons containing a reformed sample of Seymour (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Aquic Argiudoll) silt loam A horizon over a silty clay loam Bt horizon.
Low and high pH levels of 4.9 and 6.2 in the A horizon and 4.0 and 5.7 in the Bt horizon were established using dilute sulfuric acid or calcium oxide, respectively.
Plants received daily applications of simulated rain, which was either acid (pH 3.1) or non-acid (pH 5.6).
After 5, 6, or 15 d of foliar applications to corn, soybean or alfalfa, respectively, the rhizosphere pH was measured using a glass microelectrode.
The pH values for corn and soybean increased with distance from the root while the pH values for alfalfa decreased with distance.
As the soil pH increased from 4 to near 6, the difference between the pH at the root surface and the bulk soil increased from 0 to near 1.
A trend for lateral root pH values at all distances to be slightly higher than main roots was observed.
Increasing the pH of the A horizon had no significant effect on the rhizosphere pH of corn roots growing into the Bt horizon, but significantly increased soybean rhizosphere pH in the Bt horizon.
Acid rain applications caused foliar damage, and tended to decrease rhizosphere pH, but few effects were significant.
The data emphasize the effect of roots on the heterogeneity of soil pH and show that reliable rhizosphere pH measurements of in situ roots can be made using glass microelectrodes.

Abstract: Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings from two families differing in ozone sensitivity were exposed to four ozone concentrations (charcoal-filtered) (subambient ozone concentration), nonfiltered (ambient ozone concentration), nonfiltered X 1.7, and nonfiltered X 2.5) and three levels of acidic precipitation (pH = 3.3, 4.3, and 5.3) in modified open- top chambers for one growing season at Auburn, Alabama.
Seedlings were planted in the ground in root-exclusion tubes that isolated root systems of individual seedlings.
Foliage, stem, and root biomass, three-dimensional root surface area (root surface area X pi; in cm3), final height, and groundline diameter were recorded and analyzed.
Foliage dry matter and root surface area decreased and root to shoot ratio significantly increased with increasing ozone concentrations for the ozone-sensitive family.
There were no significant pH effects for this family.
No significant differences in either ozone or pH treatments occurred for the ozone-tolerant family.
The possible implications on long-term effects of ozone and acidic precipitation on loblolly pine growth are discussed.

Abstract: An open-air fumigation facility, developed for continuous fumigation of young conifers by SO2 and O3, was used for experimental exposure of decomposing coniferous leaf material.
There were no treatment effects on the rates of mass loss from litter for exposure periods from 6 wk to 44 months.
Sulphur dioxide treatment consistently increased the rate of removal of base cations from the litter, with the order of sensitivity of cations to SO2-induced leaching being Mg 
The pH of naturally fallen Scots pine needles was reduced by 0.5 units in the high SO2 treatments.
Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) activity and rates of mass loss of naturally-fallen needles were lower in SO2 fumigated plots than ambient controls.
Transplantation experiments showed that the depression in decomposer activity was caused by exposure of needles to SO2 while still green.
Ozone fumigation exerted no effects on the chemical composition of litter, and an O3-related increase in FDA activity in one season was attributed to enhanced nitrogen input due to N2O5 contamination.

Abstract: Few reports exist on the influence of electrolyte concentration and composition on SO4 retention, although sorption experiments have been conducted with a variety of supporting electrolytes.
Sulfate sorption by the B horizon of two forest Spodosols from Quebec was measured as a function of supporting electrolyte concentration and cationic composition, solution pH, and reaction time.
The solutions had an ionic strength (I) of approximately 0 (deionized H2O), 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 M NaCl, 0.01 M KCl and 0.01 M CaCl2.
Increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte (NaCl) always decreased SO4 sorption at pH 4.25.
It was proposed that increased Cl(-) ion competition for sorption sites and the formation of NaSO4(-) aqueous complexes (2.8, 14, and 55% of total SO4 at 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 M NaCl) contributed to the observed trend.
Increasing electrolyte concentration also lowered SO4 sorption by both horizons in the range of pH 3.0 to 5.2.
Moreover, the influence of pH on sorption was more pronounced at low electrolyte concentration.
At a constant I value, the cationic composition of the electrolyte also had an impact on SO4 sorption.
The presence of Ca2+ and K+ favored sorption, compared with Na+.
A mechanism involving the formation of a surface complex between Ca2+ or K+ and SO4(2-) is proposed to explain the experimental data.
The results of this study support the hypothesis that the composition and concentration of the electrolyte influence SO4 sorption by Spodosols and that both should be considered when comparing the SO4-sorption capacity of soil materials from distinct experiments or when projecting laboratory results to field conditions.

Abstract: The effects of ozone (O3) and simulated acidic rain (SAR) on the activity of selected soil enzymes in the rhizosphere of loblolly pine were evaluated.
The seedlings (Family 24.4) were exposed to 0, 80, 160, 240, or 320 nl O(3)l-1 at SAR pH treatments of 5.3, 4.3, or 3.3 for 11 weeks.
Dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activities were linearly (P = 0.01) inhibited by increasing acidity.
The influence of O3 and pH on changes of soil dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activity were independent of each other.
Changes in arylsulfatase activity were dependent on the specific combination of SAR pH and the O3 concentration.

Abstract: A regression model is introduced to estimate a trend and, possibly time-dependent, regression coefficients simultaneously.
The model is meant to detect time-dependencies in the response of tree growth to environmental conditions.
The existing models in this field usually ignore these time evolutions.
The trend is modeled via a doubly differencing scheme, while the regression coefficients, i.e., the response function, may vary in a nearly arbitrary, stochastic way.
The estimation is performed via the discrete Kalman filter.
Unknown noise variances, which control the flexibility in time of the stochastic parameters, are estimated using maximum likelihood optimization.
The model is applied to four ring-width chronologies of European silver firs (Abies alba Mill.) in the Bavarian Forest, Germany.
Monthly averaged temperatures and monthly sums of precipitation are used as explanatory variables, together with an index series of SO2 emissions in the former Federal Republic of Germany.
The latter variable is argued to be a reliable pollution indicator.
It appears that the dramatic growth variations of silver firs since 1960 cannot solely be explained by meteorological variables.
Furthermore, a strong relationship is found between the high frequency parts of both the ring-width signal and the SO2 emission series since 1945.

Abstract: The Direct/Delayed Response Project (DDRP) identified approximately 600 soils on 145 watersheds in the northeastern USA.
Soils were assembled into 38 sampling classes, based on soil characteristics thought to influence surface water chemistry.
Multivariate analysis techniques were used to evaluate the utility of the sampling classes.
Hydrologic and chemical properties of soils were determined to be the most important for discriminating among the sampling classes.
Although sampling class was a statistically significant effect for most soil chemistry variables, only a few sampling classes were particularly distinct (some Entisols, Histosols, and Inceptisols with high base saturation).
For most variables, within-sampling- class variability was less than or equal to between-class variability, although this was not true for all of the characteristics evaluated.
No better classification approaches were identified in this analysis.
The DDRP sampling classes provide a means for grouping soils for efficiency in regional soil sampling, characterization, and aggregation to mapped areas.

Abstract: As part of a study to assess potential regional surface-water acidification in the southern Blue Ridge region of the USA, more than 700 individual soils were sampled from 35 watersheds and analyzed.
Sulfate adsorption isotherms were generated for all mineral soil horizons.
Subsequent use of these data in dynamic watershed chemistry models required aggregation of adsorption data to two or three isotherms (one per soil mineral horizon) per watershed.
This study evaluated several techniques for aggregation of the nonlinear adsorption-isotherm data.
The objective of the analysis was to identify a procedure for aggregation that would generate a function providing a representative weighted average of the SO4(-2) adsorption partitioning coefficients (isotherm slopes) of several individual isotherms, and would do so over a range of dissolved SO4(-2) concentrations.
The most effective procedure involved a sequence of: (i) fitting isotherms for individual soils, (ii) computing values of adsorbed SO4(-2) corresponding to several reference concentrations of dissolved SO4(-2), (iii) computing weighted averages of adsorbed SO4(-2) at each of the reference concentrations, and (iv) fitting a new isotherm to the set of weighted points.
Two alternate procedures for aggregation, computation of weighted averages of the coefficients of isotherms fitted to data for individual soils, or fitting a single isotherm to the raw data points for several soils, gave highly variable results that were usually skewed to low estimates of slope.
Although specific results of this analysis relate to aggregation of SO4(-2)-adsorption isotherms, the strengths and weaknesses of the various aggregations have significant implications for aggregation of data sets for other nonlinear functions and for subsequent use of data.
Use of an inappropriate aggregation procedure can lead to erroneous estimates of the capacity, efficiency, or response time of the system being described or modeled, and is likely to res

Abstract: Rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils were sampled in association with the roots of field-grown, 1-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) that had been exposed to simulated acidic precipitation and treatments.
Soil samples adjacent to roots and from the bulk soil were analyzed separately for H+, Al3+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations.
For the acid precipitation treatment, H+ levels were significantly greater in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil, but no clear trend could be attributed to acidic precipitation levels.
Hydrogen ion concentrations associated with the O3, levels, at times, differed significantly by treatment, but not between rhizosphere and bulk soil.
Rain pH and O3 level produced no statistically significant distinction between rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil for Al3+, Ca2+, or Mg2+.
However, after combining rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil samples, Al3+ concentrations were found to generally increase as rain pH decreased, whereas Ca2+ and Mg2+ followed the opposite pattern.
No such pattern for O3 level was apparent.
Significant interactions between acid precipitation and O3 treatments were not detected.

Abstract: Watershed studies have documented that summer storms produce less runoff from fields farmed with continuous no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) than from the same soils when corn is Produced with conventional tillage practices.
The lack of tillage favors a continuous surface cover of crop residue and the persistence of earthworm burrows, which have been shown to be preferential flow paths for water and chemicals, especially during intense summer storms.
We investigated factors affecting preferential water and chemical transport in burrows formed by the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris (L.) in the field using individual burrow samplers and in the laboratory using blocks of subjected to simulated rainfall.
Rainfall amount and intensity and antecedent soil moisture content affected the amount of water transmitted in earthworm burrows, with high intensity storms on relatively dry no-till soils producing the greatest amounts of preferential flow.
Atrazine 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) transport was affected by the factors influencing the amount of preferential flow and by the time of storms relative to the time of herbicide application.
Atrazine movement in earthworm burrows was greatest when high-intensity rainfall occurred shortly after application.
Atrazine transport was reduced by a delay in rainfall and by low- intensity events prior to high intensity, percolate-producing events.

Abstract: Two studies were conducted in 1988 to examine the effects of simulated acid rain in combination with various levels of drought stress on the grain yield of field grown corn (Zea mays L., 'B73 X Mo17' and 'FS854').
In both studies corn was treated with twice weekly applications of simulated rainfall of pH 5.6 or 3.0 at amounts that totaled 100% (30 cm), 50% (15 cm), and 25% (7.5 cm) of the seasonal average for Champaign-Urbana, IL.
In addition to those treatments, in one of the studies the plants were subjected to daily wetting with the appropriate simulated rain from tassel emergence through pollination and fertilization.
In both studies, reduced moisture levels resulted in significant reduction in grain yield but simulated rain of pH 3.0 had no effect on yield at any of the moisture levels studied.
For both cultivars in both studies, reducing rainfall application from seasonal average to one-half of the normal decreased yields by approximately 30%.
When only one-fourth of the seasonal rainfall amount was applied, yields were decreased between 40 and 55% compared to the yield for plants receiving the seasonal average rainfall.
Results from these studies suggest that application of simulated acid rain of pH 3.0 had little or no negative effect on grain yield of the corn cultivars evaluated, even when relatively severe moisture stress was present, and when plants were subjected to daily wetting from tassel emergence through fertilization.

Abstract: This study analyzes cost effectiveness in environmental cooperation between Finland and the Soviet Union.
It is assumed that the aim of both countries is to attain a given target deposition level at minimum possible sulfur abatement costs.
Cost-effective cooperation is compared to noncooperative equilibrium and to the agreement on sulfur emissions between these two countries.
It is shown that the agreement is not cost- effective, implies higher abatement costs than under noncooperation, and is strategically unstable.
However, the cost differences and the incentives to cheat are small.
The computations reveal that the main source of potential cooperation benefits is not asymmetrical emission transportation or differences in abatement costs but rather different target deposition levels for Finland and the Soviet Union.

Abstract: Emissions of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) oxides in the midwestern and northeastern United States result in pronounced regional gradients of acidic deposition.
The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which atmospheric deposition alters the uptake and cycling of S and N in five analogous northern hardwood forests located along one of the most pronounced regional gradients of SO4(2-) -S and NO3(-)-N deposition in the United States.
We tested the hypothesis that acidic deposition would alter foliar S and N ratios and nutrient cycling in aboveground litter fall.
Sulfate in both wet deposition and throughfall increased by a factor of two across the 800-km deposition gradient.
The July concentration of S in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.)
leaves increased from about 1600 microgram. g(-1) at the northern research sites to 1800-1900 microgram.g(-1) at the southern sites.
Differences in leaf litter S concentration were even more pronounced (872-1356 microgram.g(-1), and a clear geographic trend was always apparent in litter S concentration.
The 3-year average S content of leaf litter was 63% greater at the southern end of the pollution gradient.
Nitrate and total N deposition were also significantly greater at the southern end of the gradient.
The concentration of N in both summer foliage and leaf litter was not correlated with N deposition, but the content of N in leaf litter was significantly correlated with N deposition.
The molar ratios of S:N in mid-July foliage and leaf litter increased as atmospheric deposition Of SO4(2-)-S increased.
Ratios of S:N were always much greater in leaf litter than in mid-July foliage.
The molar ratios of S:N retranslocated from the canopies of these northern hardwood forests were less than those in mid-July foliage or litter fall and showed no geographic trend related to deposition, suggesting that S and N are retranslocated in a relatively fixed proportion, Significant correlations between SO4(2-)-S deposition and

Abstract: Acid rain has been credited for the existence of most pH 
The absence or presence of acidic surface waters are reportedly due to the absence or presence of acid rain.
However, climate is responsible for two regional distributions-acid rain and acid soils.
Moist climates with reasonable growing seasons are needed to develop regionally-acidic soils and to support sufficient human population and activity to generate regionally- acidified precipitation.
That the pH of water passing through acid soils resembles soil pH and is but little influenced by the acidity of precipitation; acidic waters were nearly as common in areas receiving acid rain in pre-industrial times as they are today; regional land-use changes co-occur with acid rain, and; acidic surface waters are comparatively common in Southern Hemisphere watersheds with acid soils in the absence of acid rain all indicate that acid rain incrementally adds to the acidity of surface waters rather than creating the perceived profound widespread aquatic acidification.

Abstract: Two-year-old containerized seedlings of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) were subjected to ozone (O3) fumigation (0.25 ppm), simulated acid rain (pH 4.2 or 3.0), and drought prior to measurement of changes in growth and plant water status.
Drought caused a significant decline in terminal height growth and new-shoot dry weight, but old-shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and root/shoot ratio were not appreciably affected.
Deposition treatment (O3 and (or) acid rain) influenced both shoot and root dry weight but did not significantly affect height or root/shoot ratio.
Treatment with either 0.25 PPM O3 alone or pH 3.0 rainfall alone caused the greatest reduction in growth, while treatment with 0.25 PPM O3 + pH 4.2 rain had the least effect.
The influence of deposition treatment generally was more pronounced in seedlings subjected to drought than in well-watered plants.
Seedlings subjected to drought had lower (more negative) water potentials than well-watered plants regardless of deposition treatment.
While there were no significant differences in the water status of well-watered seedlings exposed to various deposition treatments, xylem water potential and osmotic potential of drought-stressed seedlings treated with O3 alone were consistently lower than these characteristics in seedlings treated with O3 + acid rain together.
Except for one deposition treatment (0.25 PPM O3 + pH 3.0 rain) there was no evidence for osmotic adjustment of red spruce seedlings in response to stress factors imposed in this study.

Abstract: To assess the impact of acid rain and ozone stress on the growth and physiology of slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii), four half-sib families of slash pine were planted in large open-top chambers and exposed 28 months to factorial combinations of three rain acidities (pH 3.3, 4.3, and 5.3) and four concentrations of ozone (subambient produced with carbon filtration, ambient, two times ambient, and three times ambient).
Growth was assessed by seasonal stem diameter and height increments and by stem volume increment at steady-state conditions.
Information on tree physiology was obtained indirectly from estimates on mean unit leaf rate, a measure of the net assimilation capacity of the tree.
Among the growth variables, only volume increment showed a consistent year to year response to acid rain and ozone.
The aid rain x ozone interaction was significant for volume increment each year and was the result of trees in the two times ambient ozone level having greater sensitivity to rain acidity.
Both acid rain and ozone significantly affected mean unit leaf rate; however, this effect weakened with time, suggesting some degree of physiological acclimation.
Increasing rain acidity significantly increased mean leaf area only during the first growth period.
Ozone significantly decreased mean leaf area all three growth periods, with the effect intensifying each year.
Complex family interactions with acid rain and ozone masked any clear family sensitivities to the pollutants.

Abstract: A 3-year field study of the cumulative effects of ozone (O3), wet and dry acidic deposition, and soil water availability was conducted on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) in the Sierra Nevada of California from 1988 to 1990.
Thirty-six 2-year-old potted seedlings were placed in each of 30 chambers and exposed from May through October to three levels of O3 (charcoal-filtered (CF), nonfiltered (NF), and NF plus 1.5 times ambient O3 (NF150)); three levels of acidity in simulated rain (pH /3.5, 4.4, 5.3); two levels of dry deposition (60 or 90% filtration), and two levels of soil water availability (well watered (W/W) or drought stressed (DS)).
An additional six plots served as ambient air (AA) controls.
One-third (432) of the trees were harvested at the end of each exposure season.
Low soil water availability was the only stress factor to significantly affect growth following the first exposure season.
After the second season, O3 significantly reduced foliar biomass in WW-NF150 trees, but DS seedlings did not respond to O3.
After 3 years of exposure, WW-NF150 trees averaged 70% loss of 1988 needles and 48% loss of 1989 foliage.
Ozone-injured seedlings compensated for these losses by increased growth of current-year needles and stems and also increased growth of fine feeder roots.
Radial stem growth and coarse-root growth were significantly reduced in O3- injured trees.
DS trees in NF150 chambers averaged half the needle loss of WW trees and showed no reduction in radial growth in response to O3.
Rain pH and dry deposition had no direct effects on growth of ponderosa pine.
These cumulative responses to interacting stresses indicate the importance of multifactorial, long-term studies to evaluate forest tree responses to atmospheric deposition.

Abstract: Two-year-old seedlings of white oak, Quercus alba L., and red oak, Q. rubra L., were exposed to ozone (O3) fumigations in four continuously stirred tank reactor chambers in the greenhouse for 8 h/d, 3 d/wk for 6 wk. Fumigation treatments were charcoal-filtered air (CFA) and CFA + 0.15 ppm O3.
Two simulated rain treatments, pH 4.2 and pH 3.0, of approximately 1.25 cm were applied once each week in rain-simulation chambers.
Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), third instars were allowed to feed on leaf disks from treated seedlings for 24 h. Leaf area consumed, food assimilated, weight gain, and relative growth rate (RGR) were examined.
Overall, larvae fed white oak foliage consumed more foliage and gained more weight than those fed red oak foliage.
Response to the fumigation and rain treatments was different for each oak species.
On white oak foliage, larvae consumed significantly less foliage treated with CFA + pH 3.0 rain, but the lowest RGR occurred with the 0.15 ppm O3 + pH 4.2 rain treatment.
The most food assimilated, greatest weight gain, and highest RGR occurred with the CFA + pH 4.2 rain control.
Red oak foliage consumed was equivalent for all treatments, but foliage exposed to CFA + pH 3.0 rain resulted in more food assimilated, greater weight gain, and higher RGR for that species.

Abstract: The ionic content of the solutions found in the hydrological cycle component that cross the aerial phytomass (rainfall and throughfall), percolate through the root zone and drain to streams, for tropical rainforest, particularly in Central Amazonia, is examined.
The rain waters in tropical rainforest are, in general, acidic and they provide the main chemical input to the rainforest ecosystem.
The cycling of elements in the ecosystem, dominated by the transfer of compounds between throughfall and soil solution at shallow depth, contributes a much greater flux than that from rainfall input and stream output.

Abstract: Container grown Encelia farinosa were exposed to three 3-hr episodes of acidic fog (pH 2.5) typical of events in southern California.
Adults and larvae of the specialist leaf- feeding herbivore, Trirhabda geminata, preferred to feed on the acidic-treated foliage compared to control fogged (pH 6.3-6.5) foliage.
Previous feeding damage on the plants did not affect feeding preference.
The acidic-fogged foliage was significantly higher in total nitrogen and soluble protein but not different from control-treated tissue in water content.
Stress on native populations of this drought-deciduous shrub caused by atmospheric pollutants may also result in altered feeding ecology of the beetle.

Abstract: Paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.)
and mountain paper birch (Betula cordifolia Regel) near the Bay of Fundy coast frequently intercept acidic advection marine fogs.
Chemical deposition by these fogs is thought to be a factor contributing to the observed foliar browning symptoms associated with a marked deterioration of these trees in the area.
In vitro experiments were performed to test whether pollen germination in these two birch species would be affected by acidity at levels routinely found in the fog.
The combined effect of temperature with acidity was also examined.
Pollen germination in both species was inhibited below pH 5.6 (P 
There was no difference in in vitro pollen germination between species (P

Abstract: Rates of net photosynthesis and dark respiration of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) foliage were examined in relationship to soil and foliar nutrient status at three elevations across each of three mountains in the southern Appalachians.
These studies tested our previously stated hypothesis that increased dark respiration and reduced growth were associated with natural or induced nutrient deficiency at higher elevation sites.
A consistent and highly significant reduction in the ratio of net photosynthesis to dark respiration was found at the highest sites on each mountain compared with lower sites, as had been previously reported for the initial two test sites.
This response was produced by significant increases in dark respiration that were associated with low foliar calcium levels and high foliar aluminum levels found at the higher elevation sites in this region.
Net photosynthesis was generally comparable between sites.
A consistently inverse relationship between dark respiration and foliar calcium was found across highest and lowest elevation sites, while the midelevation sites, where calcium:aluminum ratios were highest, showed less evidence of respiratory response to calcium.
Calcium in shoots was significantly reduced in association with increasing levels of soil aluminum in the rooting zone across all sites.
Collectively, these studies suggest that reduced calcium supply, occurring in association with competitive inhibition of calcium uptake by high concentrations of aluminum found in soil, may have reduced the availability of carbon for red spruce growth at higher elevation sites.
Inferential evidence examined, including atmospheric deposition levels, soil solution chemistry, and historical tree- ring chemistry, suggests that acidic deposition would have been a contributing factor in inducing or amplifying calcium deficiency.
