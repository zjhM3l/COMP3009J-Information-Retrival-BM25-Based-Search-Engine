In addition, 2,954 metric tons raw value (3,256 short tons raw value) of refined sugar will be allocated to Mexico.
The remainder of the refined sugar tariff-rate quota quantity of 38,000 metric tons raw value will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, including the 17,656 metric tons raw value (19,462 short tons raw value) reserved for specialty sugars.
A tariff-rate quota quantity of sugar-containing products of 59,250 metric tons (65,312 short tons) of the tariff-rate quota for certain sugar-containing products maintained under "Additional U.S. Note 8 to chapter 17 to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States" is allocated to Canada as a result of an agreement with Canada.
The remainder of the sugar-containing products tariff-rate quota will be available for other countries.
