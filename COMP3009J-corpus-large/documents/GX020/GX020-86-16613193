(At autopsy, these characteristic plaques -- first noted in 1906 -- are used to confirm Alzheimer's.)

The protein is called Beta-amyloid peptide and is found in the brains and plaques of humans, as well as animals.

"Knowing how the disease process works," Dr. Yakel said, "makes it more likely that medical science can find ways to slow, halt or even reverse the process."
<
Yakel, Diana L. Pettitt, Ph.D., and Zuoyi Shao, Ph.D., showed that the Beta-amyloid peptide blocks the function of a key signaling receptor, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, in the hippocampus -- the seat of memory, motivation and emotion in the brain.

It is characterized by confusion, profound forgetfulness and, often, anger.
Seldom diagnosed a few decades ago, the disease appears to be increasing as the U.S. population ages and currently affects an estimated four million Americans.

Alzheimer's Disease, or AD, is named for the German physician Alois Alzheimer.
In 1906, he noticed abnormal clumps (now called senile or neuritic plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of a then-unusual mental illness.
These plaques and tangles in the brain are now considered to be hallmarks of AD.

Simple math may become hard.

They may no longer think clearly: Speaking, understanding, reading and writing become difficult.
Patients may become anxious or aggressive as the disease continues to progress, and they often wander from home.
AD patients eventually need total care.
<
Since it is risky to remove brain tissue from a live person, doctors cannot confirm AD with total accuracy unless they do an autopsy after death to determine if there are plaques and tangles in the brain.
Several drugs have been approved for temporarily relieving some symptoms of Alzheimer's but there is no cure or drug that can stop the disease.

The 10-year-long study is considered one of the nation's most comprehensive studies to date of the long-term effects of smog on children.
The study was initiated with support from the

"Long-term exposure to air pollution has long-term effects on children's lungs, and the effects are more pronounced in areas of higher air pollution."

Normally, children's lung function grows steadily as they grow up.
Females reach their greatest potential lung function when they are in their late teens, while males reach their maximum lung function when they are in their early 20s.
After that, lung function stays level for awhile before slowly declining as a person ages.
<
Each year, USC scientists tested lung function by having each child take a deep breath, then measuring how much air the kids could blow out and how fast.
The researchers showed that as children grow up, those who breathe smoggier air tend to lag in lung function growth behind children who breathe cleaner air.
Children with decreased lung function may be more susceptible to respiratory disease and may be more likely to have chronic respiratory problems as adults.
<
On average, over the four years, the lung function growth rate of children in the most polluted community was about 10 percent lower compared to children in the least polluted community.
Similar effects on lung function were observed in boys and girls, and in asthmatic and healthy children.

"That is consistent with what we would expect from a detrimental effect of outdoor air pollution."

Instead, the offenders were nitrogen dioxide, microscopic particles known as particulate matter, and acid vapors.
All come directly or indirectly from the burning of fossil fuels (the exhaust from a car or truck, for example), as well as from emissions from industrial plants and other sources.

The area's layout as a basin, as well as the typical sunny weather and omnipresent vehicle traffic, combine to keep high levels of pollutants in the air.
Although polluted air has long been known to cause immediate uncomfortable symptoms such as eye irritation, coughing and chest tightness, long-term or chronic effects have been less clear.
In the current research, though, scientists have begun to demonstrate effects over time.

For this study, the California Air Resources Board routinely tests air in the 12 communities, from 
Locations in the Inland Empire were chosen because they were known to have relatively high levels of pollutants, while northern communities were chosen because they have lower pollution levels.

The researchers will continue monitoring students into their teens and possibly into adulthood.
They also are following students who have moved away to lower pollution areas, to see if their lung function rebounds.

Says Gauderman, "Our results indicate that continued reduction of air pollution, through the efforts of both regulators and the public, will lead to improved health in our children."
