The President and Congress focused intense attention and debate on the ethical issues surrounding human cloning and the use of human stem cells for treatment of disease.
After the President's August 9, 2001 announcement making funding available for limited research using stem cells, the Congress launched earnest deliberations on stem cell issues, and it was anticipated to be a major issue during the consideration of appropriations bills.
Following the events of September 11, Congressional focus shifted and stem cell issues were set aside in the interest of bipartisanship.
However, the announcements by private companies that their scientists have cloned human cells for the purpose of producing stem cells spurred renewed interest, and linked stem cell and cloning issues irrevocably.
There are two major camps of legislators who are particularly interested in this issue: one group wants to prohibit cloning for any reason, and the other wants to ban cloning for reproductive purposes while preserving the abilities of scientists and clinicians to use cloning technology in research and therapeutic pursuits.
The Senate leadership vowed that they would take up the cloning issue this year.
However, informal debate continued throughout the year and the issue remained unsettled.
House Conservatives are committed to banning cloning for any purpose, while in the Senate, a measure that protects the legality of therapeutic cloning techniques gained key support.
This quarter, little public activity was noted, with the exception of one hearing.
PENDING LEGISLATION
Resolutions
H. Res. 173 - Sense of the House Regarding the Benefits of Biotechnology.
This resolution was introduced by Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) on June 20, 2001 and referred to the Committee on Science.
The resolution acknowledges that biotechnology has been responsible for breakthroughs and achievements that have benefited the people and contributed to increasing the quality of life for Americans.
The resolution was scheduled for debate on November 27, 2001, but debate was postponed in the wake of the announcement of the first cloned human embryo.
H. Con. Res. 17 - Supporting Funding of Pluripotent Stem Cell Research.
Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced this resolution on January 30, 2001 to express the sense of the Congress supporting Federal funding of pluripotent stem cell research.
The resolution states that such research does not undermine any ban on Federal funding of human embryo research because pluripotent stem cells are not and cannot become embryos, and that Federal funding through NIH ensures that sensitive research will be conducted in accordance with the highest scientific and ethical standards.
H. Con. Res. 17 was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
H. Res. 232 - Establishing a Committee on Medical Research.
Introduced on August 2, 2001 by Representative John Sweeney (R-NY) to establish a Committee on Medical Research.
H. Res. 232 directs this committee to conduct a thorough and complete study of (1) the effectiveness of public/private partnerships in the advancement and funding of medical research; (2) intellectual property issues arising from the advancement of medical research and research techniques; (3) ethical and social issues arising from advancements in medical research; (4) regulatory barriers to the performance of medical research and to the dissemination and application of research findings; and (5) other issues related to medical research.
