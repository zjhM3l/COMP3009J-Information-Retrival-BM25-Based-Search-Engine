(Introduced in the House) HCON 180 IH 107th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 180
Expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States should reaffirm its opposition to any commercial and lethal scientific whaling and take significant and demonstrable actions, including at the International Whaling Commission and meetings of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, to provide protection for and conservation of the world's whale populations and to prevent trade in whale meat.
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 28, 2001 Mr. DELAHUNT (for himself, Mr. GILCHREST, Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California, and Mr. SMITH of New Jersey) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on International Relations CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
Expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States should reaffirm its opposition to any commercial and lethal scientific whaling and take significant and demonstrable actions, including at the International Whaling Commission and meetings of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, to provide protection for and conservation of the world's whale populations and to prevent trade in whale meat.
Whereas the International Whaling Commission has adopted a moratorium on commercial whaling, effective in 1986, for the protection and conservation of the world's whale populations; Whereas the United States was a world leader in establishing the moratorium on commercial whaling and continues to support the International Whaling Commission as the appropriate forum for deciding necessary protection measures for whales; Whereas new dangers, such as pollution, climate change and depletion of krill and other food resources, have emerged that threaten the future of whale populations worldwide; Whereas certain nations have ignored the Commission's moratorium and engaged in unauthorized commercial whaling and lethal scientific whaling; Whereas more than 21,000 whales have been killed for commercial and scientific purposes since the moratorium took effect, and each year the number of whales killed increases; Whereas the United States fully supported the successful adoption by the International Whaling Commission of resolutions designed to establish criteria for reviewing proposals to take whales under scientific research permits during the commercial whaling moratorium; Whereas the United States has supported all resolutions adopted by the International Whaling Commission requesting nations engaged in research whaling that fails to meet the criteria established by the Commission to refrain from carrying out such whaling activities; Whereas Japan, one year after the commercial whaling moratorium came into force, commenced a lethal scientific whaling program whose apparent purpose was to avoid Japan's compliance with the moratorium; Whereas Japan continues to expand this program, most recently to include factory-ship whaling for sperm and Bryde's whales for the purpose of gathering information that can readily be obtained by non-lethal means, and which the Commission has by resolution criticized as being unnecessary for management purposes; Whereas on August 21, 2000, 15 nations sent a demarche to the Government of Japan protesting Japan's commercial whaling activities disguised as scientific whaling, and this international protest has had no effect on Japan's whaling activities; Whereas Norway continues to engage in commercial whaling despite the moratorium and plans to kill 549 whales in 2001; Whereas on January 16, 2001, Norway announced its intention to begin exporting whale meat to Japan, Iceland and Peru, contrary to the ban on trade in endangered and threatened species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES); Whereas studies have shown that trade in whale products permits the concealment of illegal exploitation of endangered species of whales and creates economic incentives to increase whaling; Whereas the United States has invoked the Pelly Amendment to the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 against Japan and Norway on eight separate occasions for undermining the effectiveness of the International Whaling Commission; Whereas the latest scientific information indicates that some whale populations have accumulated high levels of pollutants and these contaminants could threaten the recovery of whales; Whereas the United States has fully supported the creation of the International Whaling Commission's South Pacific sanctuary to conserve whale populations; and Whereas the American people value the world's whale populations and strongly oppose all commercial and lethal scientific whaling: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that-- the United States reaffirms its commitment to opposing any commercial and lethal scientific whaling and supporting the expansion of whale sanctuaries;
the President should use all available diplomatic channels to convey the United States' opposition to commercial whaling activities and lethal scientific whaling;
at the 53rd meeting of the International Whaling Commission in London, the United States should strongly oppose any effort to approve the resumption of commercial whaling;
at the 12th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, the United States should oppose all efforts to downlist any threatened or endangered whale population and to reopen international trade in whale meat; and given the current status of most whale populations, the President should consider all other actions, including bilateral negotiations and sanctions, to eliminate all commercial and lethal scientific whaling and prevent any trade in whale meat.
