Michigan National Guard opens Family Assistance Centers
All branches of the Armed Services welcome
Lansing, November 9, 2003--The Michigan National Guard is pleased to announce the opening of six new Family Assistance Centers in Lansing, Wyoming, Midland, Grayling, Sault Ste. Marie, and Ishpeming.
The assistance centers main function is to assist military families, especially when soldiers are deployed.
"Taking care of our families is just as important as buying the latest fighter jet, tank, or weapons system," said Maj. Gen. Thomas Cutler, the adjutant general of the Michigan National Guard.
"There is a direct relationship between a soldier's ability to successfully accomplish a mission and the quality of life that their families experience."
Currently, a little over 1,300 Michigan National Guard soldiers and airmen are on active duty, many serving in Iraq, Kuwait, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Approximately 830 additional Guard members are preparing for deployments to Iraq, Cuba, Bosnia, and the Sinai.
They are scheduled to depart in December and January.
Three other National Guard units are on alert for possible deployment.
The creation of the National Guard FACs are a direct result of increasing numbers of military deployments.
Although the FACs are run by the National Guard, in Michigan, the centers are opening their doors to all branches of the Armed Services.
"It's not just National Guard families that need help," said Master Sgt. Janet Weber, state family support coordinator for the Michigan National Guard.
"I get calls every day from the families of other services looking for answers about TRICARE (military healthcare), pay issues, financial assistance, or just an ear to listen to.
I think they call the National Guard because Michigan doesn't have any active duty posts or bases."
Typically, each FAC is open and staffed with a full-time employee weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
"We've always had family support groups in the Michigan National Guard but in the past, they've been comprised purely of volunteers," said Brig. Gen. Robert V. Taylor, assistant adjutant general for the Michigan Army National Guard.
"The FACs and our volunteers are so important.
They are the glue that bind together our deployed soldiers and their loved ones when communication is limited or impossible.
The services they provide are indispensable."
Military family members needing assistance or looking for a support network are encouraged to call one of the following Michigan National Guard FACs:
Lansing Vicki Thompson 517-334-6886
Wyoming Amanda May 616-249-2724
Midland Nicole Addison 989-835-8543
Grayling Jack Rasmussen 989-344-6143
Sault Ste Marie Jerry McDonald 906-632-7861
Ishpeming Mike Fraser 906-486-8741
In Mount Clemens, families may contact Army Community Services, located at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base, 586-307-4475.
