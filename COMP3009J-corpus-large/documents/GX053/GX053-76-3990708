Header Graphic Site Specific Image Olustee Battlefield State Historic Site Olustee Battlefield State Historic Site commemorates the largest Civil War battle in Florida.
On February 18, 1864, a Union force of approximately 5000 men and 16 cannon, under the command of General Truman A. Seymour, met a Confederate force of roughly the same number defending positions around Ocean Pond.
After fierce Confederate resistance, Union forces hastily retreated with significant casualties.
Battle losses amounted to 1,861 Union and 946 Confederate soldiers.
Participants included three all-black infantry regiments: the First North Carolina Colored Infrantry, the Eighth U.S. Colored Infantry, and the 54th Massachusetts Colored Infantry.
Approximately one-third of the Union troops were African-Americans.
Union forces stayed in Jacksonville until the end of the war and occupied several coastal towns along the St. Johns River.
Although they carried out periodic operations against Confederate forces defending east Florida, no large-scale battles were waged.
