06/29/01 Iraqi Kurds Reported Better off Than People Under Saddam's Control (U.S. scholar talks of his nine months in northern Iraq)
By Emile Siman Washington File Staff Writer Washington -- A U.S. scholar, who spent the past nine months in the Kurdish-held areas of nothern Iraq, says that region is doing better than the areas controlled by the Iraqi government.
"The obvious answer is Saddam," said Michael Rubin, a visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Rubin shared his insights into the lives and politics of the Iraqi Kurds at a briefing sponsored by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Washington June 28.
Rubin, who entered the northern provinces of Iraq via Turkey, spoke of reconstruction projects underway that include new roads, schools and water systems.
Unlike the areas under Saddam's rule, the food and medical programs in the northern Kurdish region are under the control of the United Nations.
The scholar, who has authored several academic and policy articles, including a new monograph, "Into the Shadows:
Vigilantes in Khatemi's Iran," spoke of the ordeal of the Kurds prior to the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
He said that in 1988, the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein destroyed 4000-5000 villages, among them Halabja whose inhabitants were subjected to chemical weapons.
Many were ordered to leave their villages and "those who refused to leave were killed," Rubin said.
He said the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq are experiencing a host of problems including some 800,000 internally-displaced persons, out of a population of some 3.5 million, that includes other minorities such as Turkomen, Assyrians and Chaldeans.
On the positive side, he said some 1800 villages have been rebuilt since 1991 and the child mortality rate has fallen to a level below the child mortality rate in areas under Saddam Hussein's control.
Moreover, Rubin said the internecine fighting between Kurds loyal to the Kurdish Democratic Party and those loyal to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan has died down and the area is generally quiet.
Rubin noted that the Kurds of the northern provinces see themselves as Iraqis first.
He said that the great majority of the people he spoke to in the north believe the proposed "smart sanctions," now under consideration by the UN Security Council, are futile.
The Kurds generally believe Saddam Hussein "will interpret those as a reward for his obstructionism," Rubin said.
"Saddam would say, 'If I break the rules, the sanctions could be loosened,'" Rubin said.
And while sanctions may work on paper, Saddam can always find ways to hamper them, Rubin added.
Rubin, who received his PhD in Iranian history from Yale University, said northern Iraq is currently receiving 13 percent of the money the UN gives to Iraq, but about half of that goes unspent.
As to the future of the region, Rubin believes the Kurds are not seeking independence from Iraq.
Such a prospect, in the mind of many, could "lead to regional war," Rubin said.
But at the same time, "they are not willing to live under a centralized Arab rule," he said.
"A lot of people there talk of federalism."
