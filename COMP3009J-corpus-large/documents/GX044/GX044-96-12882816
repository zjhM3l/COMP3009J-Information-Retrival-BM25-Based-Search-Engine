Chaco's managers have responded by placing shields and motion sensors on lights that are required in the park - and wherever feasible, by simply doing away with lighting altogether.
By designating the night sky as a natural resource in its General Management Plan of 1993, Chaco has become an inspiration and role model for other national parks, institutions, and communities throughout the United States.
Indeed, New Mexico night sky advocates seeking to justify night sky legislation pointed with pride to Chaco as a way of gaining support.
Corn Planting Calendar Petroglyph Much of the ceremonial life of many of the peoples here on earth may be timed to the events seen in the heavens above.
It has long been known that many New World cultures have amassed large bodies of knowledge concerning astronomy.
Sometimes agricultural practices make use of seasonal patterns reflected in the sun's movement, or of constellations in the night sky, to time activities such as planting or harvesting.
The observational powers of people who lived intimately connected to all aspects of their natural environment are known to be acute and multifaceted.
In 1970, researchers called "archaeoastronomers" began bringing their unique perspective into Chaco Canyon, hoping to reveal the astronomical secrets of the ancient builders.
Many sites in Chaco Canyon have been selected by such researchers as places that offer examples of ancient knowledge of astronomy.
Some researchers go as far as asserting that the architecture found in the great buildings of Chaco is especially aligned to solar and lunar events - not only the individual buildings themselves, but even alignments between buildings that cannot easily be perceived.
While many of these ideas remain controversial, what cannot be questioned is the extreme degree of darkness that today characterizes Chaco Canyon's night sky.
Yet that darkness is threatened by the encroachment of civilization on Chaco Canyon, and the rampant use of unshielded artificial light sources.
These 'threats' are represented by three separate and distinct entities: Sky Glow, Glare and Light Trespass.
Sky Glow is the 'dome' of light you see above cities.
Our experts can, at the present time, detect Farmington, Albuquerque, Gallup and Grants ... and sometimes smaller established villages.
Even a modern gas station/convenience store can create a sky glow detectable by our ccd cameras from miles away.
Glare is the excess brightness of a light source against dark skies.
When your eyes are adjusted to the dark, and you run across an intersection with extremely bright lights, you're experiencing glare.
Interstate highways and highway improvement projects are placing powerful lighting closer to Chaco Canyon.
Light Trespass is *any* excess light that spills beyond a light's intended use.
Mining and energy extraction companies utilize banks of floodlights that spill over to Chaco Canyon.
The general public perceives brightly-lit areas as being 'safe' areas.
But research shows that dark skies are completely compatible with being safe and secure.
Overlighting and light pollution in general wastes our nation's energy resources, and increases costs for all of us.
The focus should be on efficiency of lighting.
Using only what is necessary, and taking advantage of modern technologies to keep the impact on the night sky to a minimum.
Here are some general suggestions:
1.
Choose energy-efficient light sources, in just-sufficient wattages.
2.
Shield the light to prevent light trespass.
Lights should, in general, always be shielded from casting stray light straight up, or beyond 90 degrees horizontal.
3. Use motion detectors and/or timing devices.
4.
Be aware of reflected light; even a well-shielded light, up against a white wall, can create massive glare that spills into the night sky.

Supernova Petroglyph For many people, seeing a truly dark night sky for the first time here in Chaco Culture National Historical Park is thrill enough.
For others, the added knowledge that they are looking up into what is essentially the same sky that was seen by the Chacoans a thousand years ago provides a direct and almost spiritual link between our modern world and the time of the ancients.
All who view Chaco's night sky find it fascinating and confirming to realize that even though we may be using new methods and tools such as telescopes and computers to view the night sky today, we are looking to the heavens for at least some of the same reasons that our forbears did: To better understand the nature of the larger world around us, and our place in it.
And the awe that these perspectives awaken in visitors provide the main impetus behind continuing efforts at Chaco Canyon National Historical Park to preserve the glory of its dark night sky.
