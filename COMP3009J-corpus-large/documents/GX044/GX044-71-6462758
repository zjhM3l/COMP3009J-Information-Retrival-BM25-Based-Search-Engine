TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ INTROGRESSION BETWEEN CULTIVATED SUNFLOWERS AND A SYMPATRIC WILD RELATIVE, HELIANTHUS PETIOLARIS (ASTERACEAE) Author(s): RIESEBERG LOREN H KIM MIN J SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary:
Sunflower is one of a few crop species that is native to North America.
This affords the opportunity for exchange of genes between the cultivated crop and its wild ancestors.
Hybrids between cultivated and closely related wild sunflower are frequently reported suggesting that transgenes in cultivated sunflower can introgress into wild species populations.
This study estimates the frequency of hybridization and introgression between the cultivated sunflower and the wild prairie sunflower (H. petiolaris).
Over a 30-40 year period, the presence of crop specific molecular markers in the wild prairie sunflower indicated a low rate of introgression, with average frequencies per population ranging from 0.6 to 2.6 percent.
The low rates of introgression suggest that the gene flow between cultivated sunflower and prairie sunflower is much slower than that observed for the wild annual sunflower (H. annuus) with up to 38 percent introgression.
It also appears that it would take longer for transgenes to move into populations of wild prairie sunflower than the wild annual sunflower.
However, the escape and spread of transgenes will depend on the fitness of the gene(s), location, and linkage of the transgenes.
In terms of risk assessment, the wild annual sunflower would be of more concern than the prairie sunflower.
