In 2001 and 2002, the FCC began rulemaking proceedings to review six broadcast ownership rules, which were later consolidated into a single Biennial Review.
The six rules in question and the years of their original adoption are: * Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Prohibition (1975) The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits common ownership of a full-service broadcast station and a daily newspaper when the broadcast stations service contour encompasses the newspapers city of publication.
* Local Radio Ownership Rule (1941) Initially, the Commissions rules prohibited common ownership of same service radio stations (AM or FM) that served substantially the same area.
Currently, the FCCs local radio ownership rule provides the following limitations: (1) in a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may own operate, or control up to 8 commercial radio stations, not more than 5 of which are in the same service (AM or FM); (2) in a radio market with between 30 and 44 commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate, or control up to 7 commercial radio stations, not more than 4 of which are in the same service (AM or FM); (3) in a radio market with between 15 and 29 commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate, or control up to 6 commercial radio stations, not more than 4 of which are in the same service (AM or FM); and (4) in a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate, or control up to 5 commercial radio stations, not more than 3 of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not own, operate, or control more than 50 percent of the stations in that market.
* National TV Ownership Rule (1941) When the FCC first adopted national ownership restrictions for television broadcast stations in 1941, it put numerical limits on the number of stations that could be commonly-owned.
The rule has been amended a number of times thereafter to increase the level of common ownership permitted under this rule.
Currently, the national TV ownership rule prohibits an entity from owning television stations that would reach more than 35% of U.S. television households.
Reach is defined as the number of television households in the TV Designated Market Area (DMA) to which each owned station is assigned.
VHF stations are attributable with all TV households in the DMA; UHF stations are attributable with 50% of the DMA households.
The FCCs decision in 2000 to retain a national television ownership limit was challenged by Fox Television Stations in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit.
In February 2002, the Court reversed the FCCs action and sent the rule back to the FCC for further consideration.
* Local TV Multiple Ownership Rule (1964) The local TV ownership rule allows an entity to own two television stations in the same DMA provided: (1) at least one of the stations is not ranked among the four highest-ranked stations in the DMA; and (2) at least eight independently-owned commercial or non-commercial broadcast television stations would remain in the DMA after the proposed combination.
Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. challenged the Commissions local TV ownership rule in court.
In 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the rule to the FCC for further consideration.
* Radio/TV Cross-Ownership Restriction (1970) The original radio/TV cross-ownership rule prohibited common ownership of a radio and TV station in the same market.
The rule currently limits the number of radio and television stations one entity may own in a market.
The rule allows common ownership of at least one television and one radio station in a market.
In larger markets, a single entity may own additional radio stations depending on the number of other independently owned media outlets in the market.
* Dual Television Network Rule (1946) The dual network rule originally prohibited any entity from maintaining more than a single radio network.
A few years later, the rule was extended to television networks.
Today, the dual network rule prohibits a merger between or among these four television networks: ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC.
