#previous up next next up previous Next: The Cryptographic Hash Function Up: Random Number Generators Previous: 2^64 -2^10 + 1 2^62 -2^16 + 1 Modulus Linear Congruential Generator A second prime modulus generator that addresses the pattern appearing for Mersenne primes is provided by the prime modulus 2^62 -2^16 + 1.
This is provided by the recurrence relation:
x[n] = a x[n - 1]
Where the multiplier, a = 3355703948966806692, is hardwired into the algorithm and p, the prime modulus, is 2^62 -2^16 + 1.
The multiplier was again chosen to obtain maximal period of the generator, 2^62 -2^16 $ \approx$ 4.6 x 10^18.
The interface routines for this generator are declared as: Rng_Type RngP62_16Seed( Rng_UInt32 i, Rng_UInt32 j );
Rng_Type RngP62_16Spawn( Rng_Type *x );
int iRngP62_16( Rng_Type *x );
double dRngP62_16( Rng_Type *x );
float fRngP62_16( Rng_Type *x );
This random number generator suffers from no patterns that we are aware of and we are currently evaluating its quality using statistical tests.
