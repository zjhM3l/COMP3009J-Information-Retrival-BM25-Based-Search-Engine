With NAL Director Pam AndrÃ© presiding, NAL dedicated a Yoshino cherry tree (donated by the U.S. National Arboretum) in honor of Foster E. Mohrhardt, 1907-1992, Director, National Agricultural Library, 1955-1968.

Foster Mohrhardt was recognized for his leadership and innovation in the library field.
Among his many accomplishments, he was responsible for official recognition of the USDA library as a national library and construction of the library building in Beltsville.
He also transformed the Library's program through publication of the Library's card catalog in book form, development of an agricultural thesaurus, and computerization of cataloging and indexing.
The Prince George's County Police Bagpipe band led guests to the dedication site to begin the ceremony.

Katri Nowak, Foster Mohrhardt's daughter, attended the dedication with her husband and granddaughter.
Other special guests were USDA Deputy Secretary Richard Rominger and Mrs. Evelyne Rominger; Dr. Ronnie Lowenstein of Congressman Major R. Owens' staff; and students of Ms. Rosalie Roger's fifth grade class of P.S. 241, the Emma Johnston School of District 17, in Brooklyn New York.
The NAL is working with Congressman Owens' staff to connect the school with agricultural science resources via technology.
As the Brooklyn children joined the festivities, each was given an Impatiens plant as a memento of their visit to the National Agricultural Library.
With special guests seated, the dedication began.

The logic maze was an enjoyable challenge for both adults and children.
Story time, presented by Monica Forbes and Tim Lewis of the Beltsville branch of the Prince George's County Library System proved a big hit with all ages.

Story time brought NAL's Community Appreciation Day to a happy ending.
