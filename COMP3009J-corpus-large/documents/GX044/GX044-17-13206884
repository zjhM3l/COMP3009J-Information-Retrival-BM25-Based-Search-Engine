Celebrating Juneteenth
By Tanu T. Henry
On June 19, 1865, Gordon Granger, a general with the Union Army, informed slaves in the Gulf of Mexico town of Galveston, Texas that the federal government had set them free two and a half years previously.
President Abraham Lincoln had first issued the Emancipation Proclamation in the fall of 1862, and it had become official on January 1, 1863.
But it had taken more than two years of Union military victories and the end of the Civil War before the news reached many slaves in the remote South.
According to legend, many of the newly released African Americans celebrated jubilantly and immediately began to travel to nearby states to reunite with estranged relatives.
Although emancipation is regarded as a seminal event in American history, there has never been a federal holiday to observe the end of North American slavery.
Nevertheless, that momentous June 19 celebration in Texas Ã¢ commonly called Juneteenth Ã¢ is quickly becoming a staple in many parts of the U.S., and in more than ten countries around the world.
Juneteenth was declared an official paid holiday in Texas 20 years ago, and in February 2000 Delaware followed suit by declaring the third Saturday of June an official state holiday.
Juneteenth is unofficially observed in Florida and Oklahoma, formally acknowledged in more than 200 U.S. cities, and in 1997 the U.S. Congress voted to recognize Juneteenth as the "Independence Day" for Americans of African descent.
And this year, for the first time, a three-day celebration will be held on the National Mall in Washington to commemorate the 135th anniversary of the famed manumission announcement.
Many African American leaders are pushing for Juneteenth to become a legal holiday in their local states and cities.
In Maryland, for example, Senator Joan Conner Conway of Baltimore, along with six of her colleagues, introduced a bill to make June 19 a paid holiday for state employees.
Conway later amended the bill to request that the day only be observed as an unpaid holiday because she feared that a paid holiday would cost the state too much money in overtime pay.
But it has still not been passed in the Maryland legislature.
For many of those who advocate recognizing Juneteenth as an official holiday, the significance of the day goes beyond a commemoration of the end of slavery.
For many, the story about word of emancipation having only reached some slaves years after its proclamation, is an important reminder of the necessity of claiming freedom for oneself instead of waiting for it to be granted.
"It's about knowing that you're free," said Maryland State Senator Nathaniel Exum, who co-sponsored Conway's Juneteenth bill.
"I think it's important that people are aware of their history and what surrounds the make up of that history."
Some observers criticize attempts to make Juneteenth an official United States holiday.
Many of the holiday's critics feel the celebration trivializes the freedom of African Americans and only observes the emancipation of blacks in a particular city in the United States.
In a searing critique of the holiday, USA Today columnist DeWayne Wickham called the national celebration of Juneteenth a "bad idea."
"While it's understandable that some descendants of people who were slaves when the Declaration of Independence was issued shun the July 4 celebration, it baffles me that so many would be drawn to Juneteenth, which is little more than a commemoration of lateness," he wrote.
"Why not elevate to special status another day Ã¢ December 6, 1865 Ã¢ when the Thirteenth Amendment that freed slaves throughout the United States became a part of The Constitution?"
But as Richard Newman of Harvard's W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research says, there is no one day on which all slaves were freed.
"The Emancipation Proclamation never really freed anyone.
Slavery ended gradually, by military conquest," Newman said.
"Wherever there was Union military occupation, there was no slavery.
And slavery was legally abolished over time by Congress and the Thirteenth Amendment.
You can't point to any one date when slavery ended in the United States.
Juneteenth is a surrogate for that."
In Washington, this year's festival will include a Father's Day worship service, a benefit concert and a march from the historic home of Frederick Douglass to the steps of the U.S. Capitol.
The weekend's activities will culminate in a concert and celebration Ã¢ hosted by actress T'Keyah Crystal Kemah of the television show In Living Color Ã¢ to be held on the National Mall.
"Juneteenth is a freedom celebration for all Americans," said the Rev. Ronald V. Myers, Chairman of the Washington-based National Juneteenth Observance Foundation (NJOF).
"It completes the cycle of independence in this country, which began on the fourth of July in 1776, because the last slaves were not freed until June 19, 1865."
Myers is marshaling an effort to enlist the support of Washington lawmakers, including President Clinton, in his campaign to make Juneteenth a national holiday.
The NJOF is also proposing that a "Freedom Memorial" be constructed in the nation's capital to commemorate black emancipation.
Juneteenth festivals like the one in Washington will be held all across the country from Anchorage, Alaska to Ogden, Utah to Rock Hill, South Carolina, featuring barbecues, jazz festivals, gospel concerts, church services, motivational lectures and beauty pageants.
In Boston an actress portraying Harriet Tubman will lead a ceremonial flag-raising.
And in Mount Vernon, New York, festivities will include a tribute to Negro League baseball players and a classic car show.
To many celebrants, Juneteenth is special because it's one of few specifically African American holidays.
"That's all we have as a people aside from Martin King's birthday," said John Mosley, Director of the Louisiana-based African American Male and Female Institute, which hosts Juneteenth celebrations in New Orleans.
"The Italians celebrate Christopher Columbus and the Mexicans celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
All of these are now celebrated nationally."
Recounting his experiences living in New Orleans during the segregated 1960s, Mosley emphasized that it is important for African Americans to remember and honor the struggles of their ancestors.
"Since America is so engrossed in celebrating different cultures and people, we who have labored to build this country would like a national holiday that celebrates us," he said.
If efforts like the NJOC's are successful, Juneteenth will become more widely celebrated by all Americans as a symbolic snapshot of what the broader process of African American liberation entailed.
Or maybe people will begin to celebrate January 1st Ã¢ along with their New Year's Day celebrations Ã¢ as the commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation.
No matter what happens, most people agree that there should be some formal acknowledgement of the emancipation of blacks in America.
