A 1950s Kind of Day - Lesson Plan _________________________________________________________________
Background Notes
Your study of the 1950s in Michigan should result in discussions of many serious topics: the Cold War, the Korean Conflict, redlining, polio epidemics, and the launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union.
Yet, when many Michiganians remember the 1950s they think of the decade as a time of prosperity and consumerism.
Their memories include * colored kitchen appliances * cars with fins and chrome * the building of interstate highways * suburbs and supermarkets * a governor--G. Mennen "Soapy" Williams--with a polka dot bow tie * presweetened cereals from Battle Creek * television * the building of the Mackinac Bridge
Celebrate the completion of your study of the 1950s with "A 1950s Kind of Day."
On the serious side, make it a day when students present reports, displays, and art and audio-visual projects about the 1950s topics that they've researched.
All the activities during the day should reflect research.
Depending upon the age of the students, the "1950s Kind of Day" may be engaged in for fun by elementary students, organized by middle or junior high school students for younger students, or put on by junior and high school students as a fund-raiser for a sports, band, or other project with tickets required for admittance.
Objectives
* Students will express appreciation of the enjoyment brought by activities from decade that had TV but did not yet know about computer and video games and VCRs.
* Students will be able to identify activities and products from the 1950s.
Michigan Social Studies Curriculum Content Standards
This lesson presents an opportunity to address, in part, these standards: * 4.4.5 ECONOMIC SYSTEMS: Students will explain how they act as a producer and a consumer.
* 4.4.10 ECONOMIC SYSTEMS: Students will analyze how purchasers obtain information about goods and services from advertising and other sources.

2.

What do they remember about the decade? What were their favorite fashions and fads? 3.
Choose elements for your "1950s Kind of Day."

f you have an hour or so to spend, you might include only a display, a Scrabble competition, and listening to 1950s records
.

+ Hold contests.
Give prizes.
+ Select a panel of "judges," play three 1950s songs, and have them rate each on a scale of 1-10 as to their beat and whether you could dance to them--a la "American Bandstand."
+ If participants came in 1950s clothing, have a fashion show and vote for the best.
+ Have a dee-jay contest.
Let students who want to enter the contest put their names in a fish bowl.
Draw three (or more).
Each gets to introduce and play a 1950s song.
Vote by applause for the best.
+ End the activities with prizes for games and contests--and for the persons exhibiting best knowledge of the 1950s history!
Questions for Discussion or Research
1.
How did television advertising impact family life during the decade? 2.
