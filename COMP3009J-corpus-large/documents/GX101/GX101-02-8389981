Porker Award September 19, 1997 "BIG DIG" WINS SECOND PORKER WASHINGTON -- For spending "big money on Big Dig expenses that had little or nothing to do with the legitimate purposes of Boston's Central Artery project," the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has won Rep. Tom Petri's Porker Award for a second time.
Two weeks ago Rep. Petri reported on some of the waste he says he has found in the huge Boston, Massachusetts project to build two highway tunnels.
"I said that the project was originally supposed to cost $2.5 billion, but the cost had grown to $10 billion.
Sadly, my information was out of date.
Congress' General Accounting Office now estimates that the 'Big Dig' (as it's called) will cost an estimated $11.6 billion to complete, 85 percent of which comes from federal taxpayers," Petri said.
The Big Dig requires major disruptions during construction.
So, Petri explained, in order to keep everybody happy and quiet, the administrators of the project have been spreading money around to all sorts of local government agencies, businesses, and educational institutions.
"Consider one example: The Boston Fire Department wanted a fire boat.
So project administrators had a contractor go out and buy a glorified dinghy at a cost of $230,000.
The state Inspector General says that was $100,000 too much, partly because the contractor took a $70,000 commission.
And after the purchase was made, the boat had to be redesigned because firefighters with their equipment on, couldn't get into the cabin.
And the fuel tanks were exposed -- meaning that the whole thing could blow up if the fire boat got near a fire," Petri said
