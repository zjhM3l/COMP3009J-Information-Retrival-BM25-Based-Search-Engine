Significance
Incidence and Mortality
Lung cancer has a tremendous impact on U.S. mortality, with an estimated 157,200 deaths in 2003 in men and women combined.[1] Lung cancer incidence and mortality rates increased markedly through most of the last century, first in men and then in women.
Lung cancer now accounts for 14% of new cancer cases and 28% of all cancer deaths each year in the United States.[2] Death rates for lung cancer in women surpassed those for breast cancer in 1987, and lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer deaths in both genders.
In 2003, it is estimated that there will be 68,800 deaths among U.S. women due to lung cancer, compared to 39,800 due to breast cancer.[1]
Cigarette Smoking is the Primary Risk Factor
The epidemic of lung cancer in the 20th century is due primarily to increases in cigarette smoking, which is the dominant cause of lung cancer.
The great variation in lung cancer mortality rates by state more or less parallels long-standing state-specific differences in tobacco use.
For example, among men average annual age-adjusted lung cancer death rates for 1990 to 1996 were highest in Kentucky (103.4 per 100,000), where 33.1% of men were current smokers in 1997, and lowest in Utah (45.8 per 100,000), where only 16.1% of men smoked.
Among women, lung cancer death rates were highest in Nevada (45.8 per 100,000), where 29.8% of women were current smokers, and lowest in Utah (13.9 per 100,000), where only 11.5% of women smoked.[2]
Surgical treatment or radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for early stages of cancer.
Unfortunately, initial success with these modalities is overshadowed by the potential for long-term development of second primary tumors.[3] Therefore, new approaches for controlling lung cancer are being developed, including prevention strategies, such as cancer chemoprevention.
The Biology of Carcinogenesis
Understanding the biology of carcinogenesis is crucial to the development of effective chemoprevention.
Two basic concepts supporting the chemoprevention approach are the multistep nature of carcinogenesis and the diffuse field-wide carcinogenic process.
Epithelial cancers in the lung appear to develop in a predictable series of steps extending over years.
Epithelial carcinogenesis is conceptually divided into 3 phases: initiation, promotion, and progression.
This process has been inferred from human studies identifying clinical-histological premalignant lesions (e.g., metaplasia and dysplasia).
The concept of field carcinogenesis is that multiple independent neoplastic lesions occurring within the lung can result from repeated exposure to carcinogens, primarily tobacco.
Patients developing cancers of the aerodigestive tract secondary to cigarette smoke also are likely to have multiple premalignant lesions of independent origin within the carcinogen-exposed field.
The concepts of multistep and field carcinogenesis provide a model for prevention studies.[4]

Evidence of Benefit
Etiology and Biology of Lung Cancer
The most important risk factor for lung cancer (as well as for many other cancers) is tobacco use.[1-3] Cigarette smoking has been definitively established by epidemiologic and preclinical animal experimental data as the primary cause of lung cancer.
This causative link has been widely recognized since the 1960s, when national reports in Great Britain and the United States brought the cancer risk of smoking prominently to the publicÃ¢s attention.[2] The percentages of lung cancers estimated to be caused by tobacco smoking in males and females are 90% and 78%, respectively.
Cigar and pipe smoking also have been associated independently in case-control and cohort studies with increased lung cancer risk.[4,5] The cigar risks are of particular concern because of the recent increase in cigar use in the United States.[6]
In miners, radon, independently and increasingly with smoking, is an established lung cancer risk factor.
Using epidemiologic evidence from miners, the authors [8] estimated that the lifetime relative risk for residing in a home at the Environmental Protection Agency action level of 4 picocuries per liter is about 1.4 for smokers and 2.0 for nonsmokers.
The authors also estimated that 10% of all lung cancer deaths and 30% of lung cancer deaths in never-smokers are attributable to indoor radon.
Although the validity of this model-based extrapolation from miners is uncertain, a recent meta-analysis of case-control studies of lung cancer and indoor radon exposure provides similar estimations of risk.[9,10]
Second Hand Tobacco Smoke
Environmental, or second-hand, tobacco smoke is also implicated in causing lung cancer.[11] Environmental tobacco smoke has the same components as inhaled mainstream smoke, although in lower absolute concentrations, between 1% and 10%, depending on the co
Carcinogenic compounds in tobacco smoke include the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including the classical carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and the nicotine-derived tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK).
Elevated biomarkers of tobacco exposure, including urinary cotinine, urinary NNK metabolites, and carcinogen-protein adducts, are seen in passive smokers.
Lung cancer is considered to be the end-stage of multistep carcinogenesis.
Genetic damage caused by chronic exposure to carcinogens, e.g., those in cigarette smoke, is the driving force behind the multistep process.
Evidence of genetic damage is the association of cigarette smoking with the formation of the DNA adducts in human lung tissue.
An unequivocal link between tobacco smoke and lung carcinogenesis has been established by molecular data.[12-14]
Smoking Prevention and Cessation
Substantial harm to the public health accrues from the smoking habit.
Compared with nonsmokers, smokers exhibit a dose-dependent increase in the risk of dying from lung, head and neck, bladder, and other cancers.[1,15] Conversely, substantial benefits accrue to the public health from smoking cessation.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Prevention and Cessation of Cigarette Smoking: Control of Tobacco Use for more information.)
Avoidance of tobacco use is the most effective measure for preventing lung cancer.
Evidence suggests that the preventive effect of smoking cessation depends upon the duration and intensity of prior smoking and upon time since cessation.
A 30% to 50% reduction in lung cancer mortality risk has been noted after 10 years of cessation.[1,15-17] One powerful indicator of the benefit of reduced tobacco consumption (due to both decreases in smoking initiation and increases in smoking cessation) is the decline in overall age-adjusted lung cancer mortality among men since the mid 1980s, which is consistent with reductions in smoking prevalence among men since the 1950s.[18]
Gender differences in time trends for lung cancer are a reflection of first, the later adoption of cigarette smoking and, second, the later reduction in smoking prevalence among women compared to men.
Nicotine dependence exposes smokers in a dose-dependent fashion to carcinogenic and genotoxic elements that cause lung cancer.[16] Overcoming nicotine dependence is often extremely difficult.
The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research released in 1996 a set of clinical smoking-cessation guidelines for helping nicotine-dependent patients and healthcare providers.[17] The 6 major elements of these guidelines include:[16]
Clinicians must document the tobacco-use status of every patient.
2.
Every patient using tobacco should be offered one or more of the effective smoking cessation treatments that are available.
3.
Every patient using tobacco should be provided with at least one of the effective brief cessation interventions that are available.
4.
In general, more intense interventions are more effective than less intense interventions in producing long-term tobacco abstinence, reflecting the dose-response relationship between the intervention and its outcome.
5.
One or more of the 3 treatment elements identified as being particularly effective should be included in smoking-cessation treatment: a.
Nicotine-replacement, e.g., nicotine patches, gum. b. Social support from clinician in the form of encouragement, assistance.
c. Skills training/problem solving (cessation/abstinence techniques).
6.
To be effective, health care systems must make institutional changes resulting in systematic identification of tobacco users and intervention with these patients at every visit.
Pharmacotherapy of smoking, including nicotine replacement therapies (gum, patch, spray, lozenge, and inhaler) and antidepressant therapy (e.g., bupropion), result in statistically significant increases in smoking cessation rates compared with placebo.
Since the AHCPR guidelines were published, additional evidence of the effectiveness of such pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation has been published.[20-22] The choice of therapy should be individualized based on a number of factors, including past experience, preference, and potential agent side effects.
In addition to individually-focused cessation efforts, a number of efforts at the community, state, and national level have been credited with reducing the prevalence of smoking over time.
These include: reducing minorsÃ¢ access to tobacco products, disseminating effective school-based prevention curricula together with media strategies, raising the cost of tobacco products, using tobacco excise taxes to fund community-level interventions including mass media, providing proven quitting strategies through health care organizations, and adopting smoke-free laws and policies.[19,23]
The Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMIT) was an NCI-funded large-scale trial to assess a combination of community-based interventions designed to help smokers cease the tobacco habit.
COMMIT involved 11 matched pairs of communities in North America, which were randomly assigned to an arm offering an active community-wide intervention or a control arm (no active intervention).[24] The 4-year intervention included community psychology principles implemented through existing media channels, major community organizations, and social institutions capable of influencing smoking behavior in large groups of people.
The interventions were implemented in each community through a local community board that provided oversight and management of COMMIT activities.
In the cohort analysis of COMMIT, the mean quit rate of heavy-smokers was 18.0% in the intervention communities versus 18.7% in the control communities (P=.68).
The light-to-moderate-smoker quit rates were statistically significantly different: averages of 30.6% and 27.5% for the intervention and control communities, respectively (P=.004).
Although no significant differences in quit rates between the sexes were observed, less-educated light-to-moderate smokers were more responsive to the intervention than were college-educated smokers with a light-to-moderate habit.[25,26]
Although a measurable benefit was demonstrated for light-to-moderate smokers, no such effect was obtained for heavy smokers.
A better strategy is needed to prevent initial smoking behavior and to treat highly dependent smokers.
Screening and detection of cancer at an earlier, more treatable stage, is worthy of continued study.
Although prior trials using chest radiographs and sputum cytology have not shown improved lung cancer mortality,[27-33] screening with low-dose helical CT is currently under investigation.[34]
Chemoprevention
Studies have examined whether it is possible to prevent cancer development in the lung and other aerodigestive tract sites using chemopreventive agents.
Chemoprevention is defined as the use of specific natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent carcinogenesis before the development of invasive malignancy.
Chemoprevention studies include efforts to control carcinogenic stages and risks in a population ranging from healthy individuals with no known risk factors to persons at high risk of developing cancer, such as patients cured of an initial cancer who are at elevated risk of developing another primary cancer.[35,36]
Chemoprevention is not yet established in standard clinical practice, but there is intensive study of this strategy for cancer prevention in the lung and other epithelial sites.
Such studies have served to develop both human models for the study of chemoprevention and specific chemopreventive regimens.
The field-cancerization hypothesis in upper aerodigestive tract malignancy, which predicts diffuse epithelial injury as the result of inhaled carcinogens, has guided the development of these studies.
Clinical evidence for field carcinogenesis is found in the occurrence of premalignant lesions and multiple primary tumors.[37,38] Molecular studies provide further evidence for multistep and field carcinogenesis in the lung.[12,13,36]
Reversal of Premalignancy
A chemoprevention trial using isotretinoin also employed histologic studies of bronchoscopic biopsies to examine the intermediate end point of squamous metaplasia.[39] This study included randomization to isotretinoin or placebo groups in order to confirm the activity reported in the earlier uncontrolled trial.
A similar reduction in the extent of squamous metaplasia in 35 isotretinoin-treated patients (54.3%) and 34 placebo-treated patients (58.8%) was reported, indicating that isotretinoin at the given dose-schedule (1 mg/kg/day) had no impact on reversal of squamous metaplasia.
A similar conclusion was reached in a randomized trial of etretinate for the reversal of metaplasia read from sputum samples.[40] Of the 138 participants in this study who completed 6 months of treatment with etretinate (25 mg/day) or placebo, 32.4% of the 71 etretinate-treated patients and 29.8% of the 67 placebo-treated patients had improvement in sputum atypia.
A placebo-controlled randomized lung cancer chemoprevention trial of beta carotene (50 mg/day) plus retinol (25,000 IU every other day) in approximately 750 U.S. male asbestos workers has been reported.[41] At a median intervention period of 58 months, there was no difference between the 2 study arms in the primary endpoint of prevalence of sputum atypia.
These trials have established that retinoids have minimal or no effect on metaplasia, but the response of metaplasia to smoking cessation and its spontaneous variability indicate that metaplasia may be 1 of the earliest stages in the carcinogenic process.
Retinoids have shown activity in later stages of the carcinogenic process, and it is therefore possible that they are active in later stages of lung premalignancy.
The activity of retinoids in the chemoprevention of lung cancer remains to be established in future trials using intermediate biomarkers that reflect later stages of carcinogenesis.
Prevention of Second Primary Tumors
Other clinical evidence of field carcinogenesis is the occurrence of multiple primary tumors.
High-dose retinyl palmitate (300,000 IU/day) was given (versus no treatment) in an adjuvant phase III trial following resection of stage I non-small cell lung cancer.[42] Although the improvement in disease-free survival for the retinyl palmitate group was not statistically significant, the retinyl palmitate group did show a statistically significant improvement in terms of time-to-new-primary cancers within the aerodigestive field.
The lifetime risk of second primary tumors following early-stage lung cancer is 20% to 30%.
This high rate allows second primary tumor chemoprevention trials to have smaller sample sizes than primary prevention trials.[35,37,42,43] A phase III trial to study the efficacy of low-dose isotretinoin (30 mg/day) to prevent second primary tumors following early-stage (I) non-small cell lung cancer is being carried out through the Oncology Intergroup involving all NCI Cooperative Oncology Groups.
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 1,166 participants received 3 years of intervention (589) or placebo (577) and an additional 4 years of follow-up.
The primary endpoint was time to second primary tumor (SPT), with secondary endpoints time to recurrence and overall survival.
Compliance was 60% in the isotretinoin arm and 75% in the placebo arm.
After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, there were no statistically significant differences between the trial arms with respect to SPT (Cox model hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.49), recurrence (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.76-1.29), or survival (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84-1.35).
A secondary analysis of treatment-by-smoking interaction suggested that isotretinoin was harmful in current smokers and beneficial in never smokers.
Statistically significant treatment-related toxic effects included cheilitis, skin dryness, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia.[43]
A European multicenter study, the Euroscan trial, is also studying the efficacy of chemoprevention following head and neck or lung cancer.[37] The Euroscan study consists of 2 parallel trials, 1 for each organ site, and is using a 2 x 2 factorial design to study the efficacy of retinyl palmitate and the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine.
Primary Chemoprevention
Two primary chemoprevention trials in lung cancer have studied individuals at increased risk for the development of lung cancer as the result of smoking or asbestos exposure.
Results of the NCI Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene (ATBC) trial were first published in April 1994.[44] This trial included 29,133 Finnish chronic male smokers age 50 to 69 in a 2 x 2 factorial design of alpha-tocopherol (50 mg/day) and beta carotene (20 mg/day).
Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: beta carotene alone, alpha-tocopherol alone, beta carotene plus alpha-tocopherol, or placebo for 5 to 8 years.
Subjects receiving beta carotene (alone or with alpha-tocopherol) had a higher incidence of lung cancer (relative risk (RR) = 1.18; 95% CI 1.03-1.36) and higher total mortality (RR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.16).
Supplementation with alpha-tocopherol produced no overall effect on lung cancer (RR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.87-1.13).
Beta carotene supplementation was associated with increased lung cancer risk (RR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.02-1.33).
This effect appeared to be associated with heavier smoking (1 or more packs/day) and alcohol intake (at least 1 drink/day).[45]
In May 1996, the results of the U.S. Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) were published.[46] This multicenter NCI trial involved 18,314 smokers, former smokers, and asbestos-exposed workers who were randomized to beta carotene (at a higher dose than the ATBC, 30 mg/day) plus retinyl palmitate (25,000 IU/day) or placebo.
The primary endpoint was lung cancer incidence.
The trial was terminated early by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and NCI because its results confirmed the ATBC finding of a harmful effect of beta carotene over that of placebo: increased lung cancer incidence (RR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.04-1.57) and total mortality (RR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.03-1.33).
Subgroup analyses from the CARET study suggested an association of excess lung cancer incidence in the active intervention group with the highest quartile of alcohol intake (especially large-cell histology).[47]
The overall findings from the ATBC [44,45] and CARET [46,47]
The mechanism of this adverse effect is not known.
Lung cancer risks were not increased in subsets of moderate-intensity smokers (less than a pack per day) in the ATBC study, or in former smokers in the CARET study.
There is no evidence from other studies (including the PhysiciansÃ¢ Health Study discussed below) [48] that beta carotene supplementation increases lung cancer risk in nonsmokers.
Both studies found that higher baseline plasma beta carotene levels were associated with lower lung cancer rates (even after beta carotene supplementation).
This finding is consistent with epidemiologic data which show that high intake of beta carotene-rich foods and high beta carotene plasma levels are associated with reduced lung cancer risk.
A recent prospective cohort study of European men who smoked found an inverse relationship between fruit intake and lung cancer mortality, but the association was limited to heavy smokers.[49] Similarly, in a recent analysis of baseline questionnaire data from ATBC,[50]
These positive epidemiologic findings and the analysis of ATBC questionnaires, together with the adverse intervention results, suggest that the beneficial outcomes associated with high beta carotene plasma levels may be due to increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables.
These findings show the importance of randomized, prospective studies to confirm epidemiologic studies.
Multiple-Site Primary Prevention Trials
In the United States, the PhysiciansÃ¢ Health Study was designed to study the effects of beta carotene and aspirin in cancer and cardiovascular disease.
The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial begun in 1982 involving 22,071 male physicians aged 40 to 84 years.
The PhysiciansÃ¢ Health Study, published in May 1996 with an average intervention and follow-up of 12 years, found no effect of beta carotene on overall risk of cancer (RR = 0.98) or of lung cancer among current (11% of study population) or former (39% of study population) smokers.[48]
