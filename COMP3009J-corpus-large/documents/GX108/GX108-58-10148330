Records of Naval Personnel During the Revolutionary War (Record Group 93)
The naval and marine service records of the Revolutionary War are fragmentary.
The information on the cards for the compiled military service records was carefully transcribed from lists of American sailors and vessels, payrolls, portage bills, and assignments of pay relating to ships of the Continental Navy and state navies, the frigate Alliance, the brigantines Dartmouth and Polly, the sloops Independence and Montgomery, the schooner Putnam, and the ship Raleigh; lists of American prisoners taken by the British ships Gibralter, Hunter, and Felicity; lists of vessels arriving and departing from Tribel's Landing in October 1781; and entries in volume 175 of the numbered record books in the Revolutionary War Manuscript Collection of the War Department Collection of Revolutionary War Records (RG 93), which includes the names of many sailors from New York and Virginia.

Records of Volunteer Soldiers Who Served From 1784 Until 1811 (Record Group 94)
The U.S. Army between the end of the Revolutionary War and the beginning of the War of 1812 consisted of a small Regular Army supplemented, when necessary, with state and territorial militia units called into national service.
Volunteers, raised by individual states, territories, or the national government to meet specific emergencies, also constituted a part of the military establishment.
Record Group 94 contains the military service records of soldiers who served in the various Indian campaigns, insurrections, and disturbances of the post-Revolutionary period.

Records of Volunteer Soldiers Who Served in the War of 1812 (Record Groups 94 and 407)
When the United States declared war against Great Britain in 1812, Congress authorized the President to increase the size of the Regular Military Establishment, to accept and organize volunteers, to raise units of Rangers and Sea Fencibles, and to create a Flotilla Service.
The Ranger units were raised for the protection of the frontier along the Mississippi River and the adjacent states.
The Sea Fencibles was the first organization of the U.S. Army charged exclusively with coastal defense.
With the Flotilla Service, the Sea Fencibles protected ports, harbors, and the coast.
Some confusion arose as to whether service in some units had been rendered in the Regular Establishment or in the volunteers.
The War Department, while abstracting and compiling these military service records, decided that the units of Rangers, Sea Fencibles, Flotillas, and some volunteer units that include the name "United States" or the initials "U.S." as part of their official designation were volunteer units and not units of the Regularn Establishment.
As a result of the confusion, records about members of these organizations are found in the records of the Regular Army (and Navy and Marine Corps for the Sea Fencibles and Flotilla Service) as well as in compiled military service records.
Regulars, volunteers, and militia units were also fighting Indians during the war years, 1812--15.
Records of service in the Florida and Seminole War of 1812, the Peoria (Illinois) Indian War of 1813, and the Creek Indian War of 1813--14 are found in the War of 1812 segment of the compiled military records in Record Group 94.
Many of the War of 1812 volunteer units were mustered into service for short periods (30, 60, 90, and 120 days; 6, 9, and 12 months).
Consequently, many people served more than one enlistment.
There may be two or more compilations relating to the service of the same soldier.
Generally, no cross-references refer to such service in other units or to earlier or later service in the same unit.
Members of volunteer units in the War of 1812 may also have served before or after that war, either as a volunteer or in the Regular Army or Navy.
Some veterans whose records are in this segment served in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, and a few served in the Civil War as well as the War of 1812.
Most War of 1812 soldiers, however, performed additional service in the 1784-1811 period or in the Indian wars after 1815.
Most of the compiled military service records for the War of 1812 are arranged by state or territory and thereunder by unit; the others are for units whose complements were not limited to a single state or territory, or whose designation did not include the name of a state, such as the U.S. Volunteers; U.S. Rangers; Sea Fencibles; Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek Indian regiments; 1st Battalion U.S. Volunteers (Louisiana); 2d Regiment Artillery (New York); and Captain Booker's Company, U.S. Volunteers (Virginia).
Under the name of each unit, the compiled military service records are arranged alphabetically by surname of soldier.

Records of Volunteer Soldiers Who Served During Indian Wars and Disturbances (Record Groups 94 and 407)
In the decades following the War of 1812, volunteer units often served during Indian hostilities either assisting units of the Regular Army or acting independently.
The compiled military service records, 1815--58, reflect volunteer service in the Seminole or Florida Wars, 1817--18, 1835--42, and 1855--58; Winnebago War, 1827; Sac and Fox War, 1831; Black Hawk War, 1832; Creek War, 1836--37; Indian Wars in Texas, 1849--51; the Indian (Creek) Removal, 1835--41; and various other disturbances.
The War Department did not recognize some Indian campaigns as wars, although the Treasury Department under various legislative acts reimbursed the States and Territories for the services of volunteer units.
Following the Osage War, 1832; Heatherly War, 1836; Patriot and Aroostock War, 1838--39; and Cayuse War, 1848, volunteers or their heirs received bounty land and sometimes pensions.
Although most of the people who served during the period were free citizens of the United States, Indians also served in the U.S. interest at various times, especially the Choctaw, Creek and Friendly Creek (Apalachicola), Menominee, Potawatomi, Delaware, Shawnee, and Winnebago.
Records for Indian units are generally separate.
The designations of volunteer units generally include the name of the state or territory from which they served, but researchers should note that boundaries have changed.
Service records of units of the militia mustered in from Green Bay in the Black Hawk War, for example, are found under Michigan Territory, not under Wisconsin.
Most of the compiled service records of volunteer soldiers who served during the Indian wars and disturbances are arranged alphabetically by state or territory and by war or disturbance.
The remaining units--Indian regiments and U.S. volunteers who served in the Utah Expedition, 1857-58--were not limited to any one state or territory.
The records are further arranged according to an organizational breakdown ending with the regiment or independent battalion or company.
Under each unit the service records are arranged alphabetically by surname of soldiers.
The name of the unit in which a soldier served must be known to locate his compiled service records; using an index can give a researcher this information.
The following table shows publication numbers for indexes currently available on microfilm.
Compiled service records for the Indian wars period are available on microfilm only for Florida, M1086.

Records of Volunteer Soldiers Who Served During Cherokee Disturbances and Removal
The New Echota Treaty of May 1836 fixed the time after which Cherokee Indians who refused to voluntarily leave their land in Alabama and Georgia would be removed by force.
In 1838 the War Department issued orders for Gen. Winfield Scott to remove immediately the remaining 2,000 Cherokees to Indian Territory (Oklahoma).
The Army forced the Indians into stockade camps before starting out on the 1,800 mile march west.
They arrived in Indian Territory in the spring of 1839.
Scott was ordered to take command of troops already in Cherokee country, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery.
He also had the authority to call on the governors of the adjoining States for as many as 4,000 militia and volunteers.
These microfilm publications reproduce alphabetical card indexes to the compiled service records of volunteer soldiers who served in various organizations during the Cherokee disturbances and removal, 1836--39.
In the service records and their related indexes, these operations are generally called the Cherokee War.
The compiled military service records to which the indexes refer are not on microfilm.

Records of Volunteer Soldiers Who Served During the Creek War
In 1832, a Creek delegation signed a treaty that ceded all their tribal lands east of the Mississippi to the U.S. government.
The Creek were to leave Alabama as soon as they were ready to emigrate.
The government agreed to pay all of their expenses for removal and subsistence for one year after they had arrived in the West.
Provisions in the treaty, however, allowed some members of the tribe to remain behind.
Hostilities resulted.
The federal government was unable to prevent whites from attacking tribal members and the Creeks retaliated.
In early 1836, Gen. Winfield Scott, in command of several thousand U.S. troops, State volunteers, and small bands of Indians, fought against the Creeks.
After the Creeks' defeat, the Army forceably removed them to Indian Territory.
In the spring of 1837, they arrived at Fort Gibson.
Only one index to these records is available on microfilm, M244, for Alabama soldiers.
The compiled military service records to which the index refers are not on microfilm.

Records of Volunteer Soldiers Who Served During the Florida Wars
The Second Seminole War, 1836--43, resulted from the efforts of the United States to remove the Seminole Indians from Florida.
The 1832 treaty of Payne's Landing had provided for a delegation of Indians to journey to the West and decide on the acceptability of the land set apart for them.
The Seminoles agreed to leave Florida for the West within 3 years of giving their approval.
Disputes arose, however, when the government insisted that the agreement to emigrate was fulfilled when the delegation approved the new lands, and the Seminoles asserted that the treaty would not take effect until they expressed satisfaction with their delegates' report.
The federal government ordered the Seminole Indians to gather on January 8, 1836, for removal---resistance would be met with force.
The ensuing clash plunged both sides into seven years of hardship.
Both free blacks and slaves fought with the Seminoles.
The U.S. Army enlisted volunteers and mercenaries from other tribes.
By 1843 the Army had forced all but a few hundred of the Indians to emigrate, in small groups, west of the Mississippi

Records of Volunteer Soldiers Who Served During the Patriot War, 1838--1839 (Record Group 94)
The Patriot War involved Canadian rebels and their American supporters who hoped to free Canada from British domination.
The "Patriots" were mostly American farmers and unemployed artisans.
They made three different extensive plans in 1838 for widespread simultaneous attacks along the Canadian border, hoping eventually to join forces and establish a republic in Canada.
When the plans failed, the movement came under the domination of a secret society, the Hunters and Chasers of the Eastern Frontier.
Congress passed a stronger neutrality act in March 1838.
Federal troops were sent to the frontier and, in the border states, the militia was called out to suppress the plotters.
Only two alphabetical indexes are available on microfilm.
The compiled military service records to which these indexes refer are not microfilmed.

Records of Volunteer Soldiers Who Served During the Mexican War (Record Group 94)
War with Mexico was declared on May 13, 1846, less than 6 months after Texas had been admitted to the Union.
The act specified the service of the Regular Military and Naval Establishment and the use of volunteers and the militia.
Militia service was limited to no more than 6 months of continuous service, while the volunteers could be mustered for 12 months or until the end of the war.
Some of the volunteers who served in the Mexican War had also served in the earlier Indian wars or would later serve in the Civil War.
Some of the Texas volunteers were retained in service after the war to protect the frontier areas of Texas from Indian attack.
For an alphabetical list of volunteer officers in the Mexican War,showing rank and organization, see Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army, by Francis B. Heitman (Washington, DC, 1903), 2:43-73.
