Summary: Security services were brought into Russia by market reforms in the early nineties, and in response to the huge growth in private business, the market for security services has been taking shape ever since.
The passing of the law on private security and detective services 1992 encouraged the growth of private security companies and detective agencies.
Commonly, security services agencies are staffed with retired officers from enforcement agencies who are capable of providing quality services.
End summary.
There are over 3,000 security agencies registered in Moscow but only about 50 of them have a fully professional reputation.
Many security agencies are staffed by well-connected former, and in some cases current, Interior Ministry and Federal Security Service (former KGB) officers.
The Interior Ministry itself offers what it calls "extraministerial" security, a fee service manned by police.
The days when it was acceptable to offer one or two specific services are gone.
To fit the present day market an agency should be capable of providing a full and wide range of security services.
Although, due to local regulations and market conditions, selected services are not offered in all locations.
Among the services more frequently offered are the following:
Â· Property guarding services
Â· Transportation security services
Â· Executive and VIP protection
Â· Physical security personnel
Â· Investigative services
Â· Cash-in-transit services
Â· Operation and maintenance of facilities
Â· Protection of information and files administration
Â· Consulting services
Â· Correctional services
Private security services agencies find clients mostly among commercial entities, and much less among individuals.
To a great extent this fact is explained by the high cost of security services.
The August 1998 crisis considerably cut security agencies clientele, and consequently increased competition.
This forced security agencies to diversify their services and cut rates by 20-30 percent.
Moreover, negotiating with an agency may cut an additional 10-50 percent of the cost.
Alternatively, many well-established and reputable agencies prefer to attract clients by offering a wider range of better quality services, rather than reducing their fees.
Many do not have fixed price lists, but prefer to negotiate costs with each client individually.
When selecting a security services agency market experts advise to seek the services of a professional security agency and observe the following recommendations:
Â· Make your first point of reference professional catalogues and specialized journals in which security agencies advertise.
Talk to friends and colleagues about who they use.
It is also very useful to contact the Interior Ministry Licensing Department where you can obtain all background information on a security agency.
Â· Examine the agency's licenses, and pay attention to the license expiration date.
Normally, licenses are granted for three years, and after this period they are extended for another five years.
Find out if the agency is able to provide you with licensed security guards.
Russian licensing bodies require all private security agencies' personnel to have individual licenses.
According to Moscow standards, a security agency with about 50 licensed security guards is small, from 50 to 100 guards - medium, and over 100 guards - large.
Â· Negotiate service rates with the agency's management.
The following are average rates in the Moscow security services market:
-physical protection of locations: $3/hour per one post per one licensed guard, unarmed
-physical protection of locations: $6/hour per one post per one licensed guard, armed
-physical protection of locations from crime/terrorism threat: $10/hour
-personal physical protection services: $10-15/hour per one bodyguard
-VIP escort: $6-15/hour per one body guard; $9-20/hour per driver-guard; and $20/hour per VIP vehicle
-transportation of valuables: $100/hour (complete range of services)
-freight escort: $8/hour plus $2/hour for the guard's commute
-vehicle escort with a driver: $16/hour
Discounts: In general there are two types of discounts.
One is based on the number of guards hired (3 percent per guard) and another is an advance payment discount (15 percent for three month prepayment).
Â· Security guards have to be equipped with professional portable radio transmitters (Motorola-type), and each transmitter has to be accompanied by a license.
Â· Inquire about a security agency's motor pool.
Commonly, a credible agency has armored VIP class vehicles and cash-in-transit vehicles.
Each vehicle should be equipped with a radio transmitter.
Â· Find out if a security agency has its own office and a 24-hour emergency phone.
Â· Consider the guards' uniforms.
An established agency provides its personnel with three sets of uniforms: a uniform with an agency's ID to wear on location, a civil suit for escort services, and a camouflage uniform for freight escort services outside of Moscow.
Private security agencies' personnel are not allowed to use camouflage uniform in Moscow.
Â· Inquire of the number of clients and the agency's annual turnover.
Serious agencies share this information openly.
A large agency usually has over 15 clients and an annual turnover exceeding $1 million.
A medium size company has
5-15 clients, and its annual turnover is $500,000 to $1 million.
Â· Do a background check by talking to other clients and any other references the agency may have.
Â· Check the agency's membership in professional associations.
Membership in international and Russian professional associations such as the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS), International Professional Security Association (IPSA), or Council for Business Security of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry indicates a company's adherence to established standards of security services.
Â· Examine if the contract includes a special provision on the agency's financial responsibilities towards its client, stating that in case of failure to provide services the security agency would reimburse a client's expenses.
It is important to find out if an agency has an agreement with an insurance company.
A solvent agency would normally state a $1 million professional liability.
The following is a list of local organizations and private agencies specializing in providing a wide range of security services.
