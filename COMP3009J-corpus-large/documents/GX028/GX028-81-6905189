[press.gif] _________________________________________________________________ # 074/98 April 10, 1998 State Department Spokesman on Pol Pot The following is an edited version of State Department Spokesman Jamie Rubin's responses to questions about the April 9 The New York Times story about reported plans to capture and try Pol Pot.
Mr. Rubin spoke to the press at the daily State Department Noon Briefing on April 9, 1998, in Washington, D.C.
The full transcript of the briefing is available on the U.S. Mission home page at http://usa.or.th under the USIS Thailand/News and Current Events section.
Q: Do you have anything to say about this reported plan to capture Pol Pot?
MR. RUBIN: Let me say this: We strongly believe that Pol Pot and other senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be held to account for the atrocities that took place in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, and we would support international efforts to bring that about.
We have discussed this issue with many governments over the past several months and years, and have made it clear we are prepared to support and work to implement any of a variety of options, should Pol Pot and others become accessible to the international community.
Q: But have you devised a specific plan to take custody of him, if he was offered to you, and to prosecute him?
MR. RUBIN: Obviously, this process I described that's been going on for some time now is an ongoing process.
With respect to any specific order, any specific plan, any specific action, that is a hypothetical question that we are not prepared to answer at this time.
And we're not prepared to answer questions about internal planning for such a hypothetical situation.
Q: Can you say the governments with which you've discussed it, because Thailand today felt it had to say that it had not been approached by the United States to discuss this issue.
MR. RUBIN: Well, without referencing what they did and didn't say, because I think people have interpreted different ways, obviously a country that we've been in touch with over the recent months includes Thailand.
But I'm not going to get in a position of describing every diplomatic contact...
Q: I'm just trying to figure out what is new about this, about what the administration has been doing other than--what's new about it?
MR. RUBIN: Well, maybe you'd have to talk to the reporters who think there's something new.
What I can tell you is that we do not know the exact whereabouts of Pol Pot or other senior Khmer Rouge leaders.
The situation is extremely uncertain, and we can't either confirm or deny reports that Pol Pot was recently within Thai territory.
And therefore, it's inappropriate to speculate beyond that.
I think a lot of what happens here is that different reporting occurs about where he is and where he might be and whether it's more likely or less likely that he could be in a position to be brought to justice, and that yields continued consultations and then, occasionally, these premature reports about something that hasn't happened which, frankly, may make it harder for one of the worst war criminals in the 20th century to be brought to justice.
Q: Do you think that this all might be wrapped up somehow in the upcoming Cambodian elections and the return of the prince, and so forth?
MR. RUBIN: Not necessarily.
I think there are separate issues, which is the ongoing conflict in the part of Cambodia where the Khmer Rouge still have forces, and what is going on within the Khmer Rouge in terms of the ups and downs of that civil conflict, and whether that might or might not lead to a greater chance that Pol Pot would be made available.
At the same time, with regard to the political situation, let me say that we welcome the U.N.'s decision to monitor Cambodia's parliamentary elections.
We share the concern that the elections may be threatened by the continued climate of fear and intimidation in Cambodia.
We note the report that suggests that at least 90 supporters of Prince Ranariddh have been executed in Cambodia for political reasons.
And we urge the government there to establish conditions for free, fair and credible elections, which is a necessary precondition for a political atmosphere free of fear and intimidation in which all parties and candidates can campaign freely.
I would not assume there is necessarily a connection here other than to say that the ebbing and flowing of what the conflict involves in that part of Cambodia which is still seeing civil war is what leads to reports about the likelihood--more or less likelihood of Pol Pot being made available.
Q: Just a quick follow-up.
MR. RUBIN: Yes.
Q: Is it--and you might not have the answer to this.
Strictly speaking legally, is there--is it possible for Pol Pot to be tried in the United States? Is he suspected of committing any crimes under U.S. law?
MR. RUBIN: That is obviously a good question, but also obviously a question that is difficult for me here at the State Department to answer, and I recommend you pose that question to the Department of Justice, which would handle American legal questions like that.
But let me say this: you know, there are options.
They include an international tribunal, a trial in a third country, or ultimately a trial where the crimes take place.
But as far as the extent to which that would be possible in the United States, I'd recommend you address that question to the Justice Department.
Yes.
Q: Could you not confirm the report about him being within Thai territory because you don't know or because you don't want to talk about it?
MR. RUBIN: I believe the Thai government has said publicly he was not.
And so that's an important point for you to understand about what we can and can't say.
I think there's no doubt that not only is this person one of the most horrible war criminals of the 20th century, but also a rather elusive character who's--the reports about him change a lot.
And so it's unclear exactly where he is, and we can't confirm or deny it because we don't know where he is.
The Thai government has said publicly, it's my understanding, that he was not on Thai territory.
So that's certainly one point that I would point out to you And that statement doesn't differ from anything they've told us.
Q: -- on the options on an international tribunal, are you thinking of simply expanding the scope of the existing international war crimes tribunal under the Security Council?
MR. RUBIN: Well, there are discussions under way.
That's certainly one way to do it.
There are other ways to do it.
I don't want to prejudge a very complicated legal process, but that's certainly one way to do it
Q: -- Can you say the same thing about what the Thai government has told you in relation to having Pol Pot in custody, regardless of whether he is in northern Thailand or parts of Cambodia?
MR. RUBIN: Yeah.
I am going to be reluctant to get into much detail about what we and the Thai government talk about in this regard.
The question was, "Was he in Thai territory?" and, therefore, I tried to point to a Thai government statement that said that he never was.
And I can't confirm or deny his whereabouts.
Q: Can you see an opportunity, given the fighting there, to apprehend him?
(Inaudible.)
MR. RUBIN: It would certainly be good news for justice and for the world if this terrible war criminal were made available for justice.
