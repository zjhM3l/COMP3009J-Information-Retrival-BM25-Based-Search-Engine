The Civil Air Patrol has three missions: the Cadet Program, Aerospace Education, and Emergency Services.
The Cadet Program
The Cadet Program is designed to teach cadets leadership and give them an idea of the military customs and courtesies.
All cadets must learn drill and ceremonies in order to progress through the program.
Through the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program, cadets have the opportunity to learn about aviation, travel to other parts of the world with the International Air Cadet Exchange program, attend flight academies, band encampments, leadership schools, and familiarization courses for the Air Education and Training Command and Air Force Space Command.
Those cadets who enjoy emergency services are able to attend special activities including Para-rescue Orientation Courses and Ground Search and Rescue Schools.
Aerospace Education
Civil Air Patrol provides Aerospace Education to both its seniors and its cadets.
Along with educating its own members about the importance of the aerospace field, the Civil Air Patrol also works to educate the general public about the importance of the field.
Civil Air Patrol holds workshops for teachers, assists in teaching about aerospace, and is the source of a great deal of information on the topic.
Cadets in Civil Air Patrol are required to participate in aerospace education by passing an aerospace test for many of the achievements that must be completed in order to progress through the program.
Additional programs such as model rocketry are available for cadets to participate in.
Emergency Services
Civil Air Patrol takes part in Emergency Services as a way to help the Air Force free up valuable resources.
Civil Air Patrol participates in search and rescue, disaster relief, and in times of war, civil defense.
Civil Air Patrol's fleet of aircraft are equipped with direction finding radio equipment in order to make locating downed aircraft possible, as well as making aerial damage assessment possible.
Civil Air Patrol squadrons have ground team qualified cadets and seniors that are available to take part in missions for both disaster relief and search and rescue missions.
For cadets choosing to take part in the emergency services aspect of Civil Air Patrol, Search and Rescue Exercises, Field Training Exercises, and Ground Search and Rescue School are all activities in which he or she may gain more experience and become qualified to take part in emergency services missions.
