Wesson Introduces Resolution to Halt Airline Overbooking
Sacramento - In an era where airline scheduling practices can result in the loss of travel for paid customers, Assemblymember Herb J. Wesson, Jr.
(D-Culver City/L.A.)
has introduced Assembly Joint Resolution 3 urging action by Congress and the President of the United States to further regulate this practice.
Airlines commonly sell more tickets for flights than the number of available seats in an effort to ensure maximum occupancy during each flight.
"I believe it is fundamentally wrong far a business to sell services that they can not offer.
I understand the airlines' business concerns, but it is unfair for airlines to book a seat that may or may not be available.
At a minimum, passengers should be informed of the overbooking before they purchase this ticket," Wesson argued.
While Assemblyman Wesson acknowledges that regulations governing airline overbooking are in the realm of federal jurisdiction
, he is asking both state and federal officials to join him in sending a strong message to airlines concerning their current disregard of passenger rights.
"When Aunt Mae who is flying home to see Granny in her last days is 'bumped' from her flight, what airline companies fail to realize is that a ticket voucher offered under these kinds of extreme circumstances can not make up for the scheduling hardships suffered," Wesson contends.
Assemblyman Wesson also encourages airline companies to consider that not everyone can afford the high prices involved in last minute rescheduling, nor can they abide by the scheduling changes airlines impose on passengers when they overbook flights.
"In the case of Aunt Mae trying to get home before her mother dies, what good is an airline voucher when the only person she wants to visit has already passed away? It's time that we do something about this practice," Wesson stated.
