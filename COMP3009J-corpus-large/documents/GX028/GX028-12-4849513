4.15 RECREATION This section discusses existing and proposed recreational facilities in the plant vicinities, and the potential for project impacts on recreation.
4.15.1 Regional Setting
In response to the Bay Areas urban growth, cities and regional agencies have highlighted the need for an extensive regional open space system.
Regional agencies such as the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) seek to preserve undeveloped or predominantly undeveloped land or water that may provide a variety of public resources involving recreation, historic sites, scenic areas, natural resources, and agricultural resources.
4.15.2 Local Setting
Potrero Power Plant
Within San Francisco, taking into account City, state and federal property, there are a total of approximately 4,090 acres permanently dedicated to open space.
The San Francisco Recreation and Park Department currently owns and manages over 3,300 acres of open space.
The California Department of Parks and Recreation owns approximately 171 acres at Candlestick Point State Recreation Area, and the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) owns 619 acres as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (City and County of San Francisco, 1998).
The San Francisco General Plan states that the City shoreline holds the greatest potential for new parks.
The Citys Eastern Shoreline Plan identifies the Potrero Power Plant and the surrounding area to be within the plans Shoreline Zone; therefore, the site is subject to City shoreline guidelines.
BCDC also has permitting jurisdiction that extends 100 feet inland from the Bays mean high-tide level.
Recreational uses located within approximately one mile of the plant include: Agua Vista Park and public boat ramp, and a public viewing area (Pier 52) located to the north; Jackson Playground located to the northwest; McKinley Square and the Potrero Hill Recreation Center located to the west; and Warm Water Cove and Islais Creek located to the south of the power plant.
ABAG is currently managing the development of the Bay Trail, a multi-use pathway that is intended to encircle the San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Bays.
The Bay Trail is currently proposed along Illinois Street in the project vicinity (see Figure 4.15-1).
Contra Costa Power Plant
The primary planning and agency administering major parks in Contra Costa County is the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD).
EBRPD maintains 26 parks and numerous trails within the County, performing the function of providing major park facilities normally undertaken by county government.
EBRPD maintains parks of different types, classified as regional parks, regional recreation areas, regional preserves, and regional shorelines.
The state DPR maintains and operates two parks in the County.
A number of shoreline recreational uses, including marinas, harbors, and shoreline parks, are located along the San Joaquin River, providing picnicking, fishing, and boating opportunities.
The City of Antioch, located south and west of the Contra Costa Power Plant, operates and manages approximately 60 acres of local parks, 287 acres of special-use facilities, and a number of trails within its city limits (City of Antioch, 1988).
EBRPD maintains one regional park and regional trail in Antioch.
Off-site recreational uses located within approximately one mile of the Contra Costa plant include: the Antioch Regional Shoreline, Lloyds Holiday Harbor, Lauritzen Yacht Harbor, the New Bridge Marina and the Driftwood Marina located to the east; Jacobsen Park located to the west, Meadowbrook Park located to the southwest; and Almondridge Park located to the south of the power plant site.
In addition, PG
Pittsburg Power Plant
The City of Pittsburg maintains and operates over 390 acres of local parks and parklands and trails within its city limits (City of Pittsburg, 1988).
EBRPD maintains one regional park and regional trail in Pittsburg.
A number of shoreline recreational uses, including marinas, harbors, and shoreline parks, are located along the Sacramento River, providing picnicking, fishing, and boating opportunities.
Off-site recreational uses located within approximately one mile of the plant include: the Browns Island Regional Shoreline, Marina Park, Riverview Harbor, Central Harbor and Central Harbor Park, the George Lowry Marina, Village Park, and Marina Center located to the east; and City Park, California Seasons Park, Anuta Park, Willowcove School Park and DeAnza Park located south of the power plant site.
A tree covered shoreline area named Riverside Park, and adjacent fishing pier are located in the northeast portion of the PG
PG
The City is currently responsible for maintenance of the areas.
In addition, the Harris Yacht Harbor is located in the west portion of the PG
Geysers Power Plant
There is an abundance of parks, wildland areas, forests, and waters throughout Sonoma and Lake Counties that offer recreational opportunities.
The most notable in the project vicinity is Boggs Mountain State Forest in Lake County, operated by the state DPR, which offers 34,600 acres for hiking, picnicking, camping, and hunting (Lake County, 1981).
In addition, the Middletown County Park is located over three miles southeast of the Geysers area, and two golf courses are located along SR 175 east of the Geysers area.
The Geysers area is situated on privately owned land, and is not open to the public.
Small portions of land within the Geysers area are used for private recreational-serving uses, including cabins and gun clubs; none of these uses is on PG
4.15.3 Significance Criteria
According to Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines (Governors Office, 1997), a project may be deemed to have a significant effect on the environment if would conflict with recreational uses of the area.
In addition, Appendix I of the CEQA Guidelines indicates that a project may result in a significant impact on the environment if it would increase the demand for neighborhood or regional parks or other recreational facilities, or would affect existing recreational opportunities.
4.15.4 Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Impact 4.15-1: The project could minimally increase demand for neighborhood or regional parks or other recreational facilities.
(Less than Significant)
Expansion of operations at any of the four PG
Such employment increases could cause small increases in local population, which could, in turn, increase demand for regional and neighborhood recreation facilities.
Any such increases in demand would likely be small and widely dispersed throughout local communities, and would therefore be less than significant.
Because the project would likely result in relatively small and widely dispersed demand for recreational facilities, the impact would be less than significant.
Mitigation Measures Proposed as Part of Project
None.
Mitigation Measures Identified in This Report
None required.
_________________________
Impact 4.15-2: The project would not significantly affect existing or proposed recreational opportunities.
(Less than Significant)
Potrero Power Plant
Off-site recreational uses would not be anticipated to undergo any physical changes as a result of the project.
The project would not result in an expansion of the plant beyond its existing boundaries.
As identified in Section 4.1, Land Use, Section 4.10, Noise, and Section 4.13, Aesthetics, the project would have a less than significant effect on land use compatibility, off-site noise levels, and aesthetics.
Accordingly, the project would also have a less-than-significant effect on existing and proposed recreational uses.
San Francisco Beautiful has indicated interest for the Bay Trail to shift from its current proposed alignment (along Illinois Street west of the power plant property) to a new alignment following along the shoreline through the Potrero Power Plant property; however, ABAG has not adopted this concept.
If such an alignment were to be adopted by ABAG and agreed to by PG
The divestiture project would not, however, preclude or hinder the establishment of an agreement of this nature.
Contra Costa Power Plant
Off-site recreational-serving uses would not be anticipated to undergo any physical changes as a result of the project.
The project would not result in an expansion of the plant beyond its existing boundaries.
As identified in Section 4.1, Land Use, Section 4.10, Noise, and Section 4.13, Aesthetics, the project would have a less than significant effect on land use compatibility, off-site noise levels, and aesthetics.
Accordingly, the project would also have a less-than-significant effect on existing and proposed recreational uses.
As identified in the Setting, PG
Pacific Service Employees Service Association has indicated to PG
Therefore, this recreational use would be terminated if the plant is sold.
This impact to recreation is a less than significant impact.
Pittsburg Power Plant
Off-site recreational-serving uses would not be anticipated to undergo any physical changes as a result of the project.
The project would not result in an expansion of the plant beyond its existing boundaries.
As identified in Section 4.1, Land Use, Section 4.10, Noise, and Section 4.13, Aesthetics, the project would have a less than significant effect on land use compatibility, off-site noise levels, and aesthetics.
Accordingly, the project would also have a less-than-significant effect on existing and proposed recreational uses.
As identified in the Setting, a tree covered shoreline area named Riverside Park, and an adjacent fishing pier are located in the northeast portion of the PG
PG
The City is currently responsible for maintenance of the areas.
The transfer in ownership of the Pittsburg Power Plant property would be subject to the Citys easement agreements, and would therefore not preclude or affect the continued use of these recreational facilities.
The Harris Yacht Harbor occupies PG
Geysers Power Plant
Recreational uses within the Geysers or in the surrounding area would not be anticipated to undergo any physical changes as a result of the project.
The project would not result in an expansion of the plant beyond its existing boundaries.
As identified in Section 4.1, Land Use, Section 4.10, Noise, and Section 4.13, Aesthetics, the project would have a less than significant effect on land use compatibility, off-site noise levels, and aesthetics.
Accordingly, the project would also have a less-than-significant effect on recreational uses.
Mitigation Measures Proposed as Part of Project
None.
Mitigation Measures Identified in This Report
None required.
