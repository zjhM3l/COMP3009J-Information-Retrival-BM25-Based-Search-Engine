Sequence of Activities 1.
Review with the children the ways in which families are similar and different.
Ask the children what special days their family celebrates.
Discuss why they think families celebrate different public or family events.
Explain that some holidays are events or celebrations that occur regularly over time and can reflect a person's cultural or religious background.
2.
Explain that families who celebrate the same holiday may have different ways of celebrating it.
Ask the children, for example, "Who celebrates 4^th of July by attending a parade; by having a picnic; by having friends to your home; by having a quiet day at home; etc?
3.
Explain to the children they are going to interview family members about a favorite holiday.
Discuss the meaning of the word "interview".
Ask the children where they have seen an interview and what one can learn from an interview.
4.
Brainstorm with the children five to six possible questions to ask a family member.
Generate a list of questions and decide as a group which questions to use.
Possible questions include:
What is one of the holidays our family celebrates? How do we celebrate this holiday? What family members participate? Why is the holiday important to our family? Reasons could be cultural, religious or historical.
5.
Type up the questions and leave room between each question for the child/family member interviewed to write down their responses.
Distribute these sheets and assign children the homework task of conducting a family interview.
Prior to the assignment, possibly in a weekly newsletter or a special notice to parents, explain that the children are going to be completing a family celebrations interview as homework.
6.
Have the children conduct the interview and write down the responses (inventive spelling is permissible).
In addition, have each child complete the following steps: 1) Answer and write down the response to the question: "Do you think when you're grown up you'll continue this holiday? Why or why not?" 2) Collect any photographs of the family celebrating the holiday and 3) Draw a picture of your family celebrating the holiday.
7.
When the children return with their assignments, mount each child's assignment individually on cardboard or construction paper and create a display.
Have each child share his or her display with the class.
8.
Review the definition of the word interview and discuss type of information an interview provides.
9.
Read from the listed Children's Literature texts to further knowledge about holidays.
Ask the children questions about each text to develop listening comprehension skills.
Assessment
Assessment occurs during Step 6 and 7 when the children conduct and bring back and discuss the results of their interview.
Individually, ask the children to verbally explain what an interview is, what this interview tells about the way a family celebrates the holiday and why an interview is a good technique to obtain answers to questions.
A performance assessment rubric may be used while the children are sharing their display with the class.
Application Beyond School
Children could conduct another interview with the same questions with a member of a different family, such as a neighbor.
Children could also conduct an interview with their own families on the topic of a different family holiday.
Connections
Arts
Children draw pictures of a holiday celebration.
English Language Arts
Children practice oral communication skills during the interview.
Children use reading skills when reading aloud the interview questions.
They use writing skills when they, with the help of their family members, write down the responses to the questions.
