Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence __________________________________________________________________
Currency Design and Security Features
What began historically as an emergency response to satisfy a shortage of coins, paper currency has become the preferred medium of exchange over the world.
However, since the very introduction of paper money, counterfeiting has not ceased to rear its ugly head.
To ensure the integrity of U.S. banknotes, new currency series have been introduced to improve on design and security features.
The most recent series was unveiled and introduced into circulation in 1996, and a new currency series is being introduced in 2003.
Each new series utilizes increasingly sophisticated technologies to incorporate features making it easier to authenticate banknotes without special equipment - while making it more difficult for the counterfeiter to produce notes on digital equipment.
These new security features have proven effective in the reduction of counterfeiting as the U.S. currency designs remain one step ahead of the counterfeiter.
Currency designs incorporating counterfeit-deterrent features for the 1996 series are illustrated in the following 21 languages:
Saudi Arabia Flag Link Bulgarian Flag Link Chinese Flag Link Czechoslovak Flag Link British Flag Link United States of America Flag Link Finland Flag Link French Flag Link Italian Flag Link Japanese Flag Link Korean Flag Link Polish Flag Link Portuguese Flag Link Russian Flag Link Spanish Flag Link Puerto Rican Flag Link Thai Flag Link Turkish Flag Link Uzbek Flag Link Vietnamese Flag Link Arabic Bulgarian Chinese Czech English Finnish French German Italian Japanese Kazakh Korean Polish Portuguese Russian Spanish Thai Turkish Ukrainian Uzbek Vietnamese
Every year, the U.S. Government and the public are victimized by the counterfeiting of U.S. currency.
As a result of the new security features being incorporated into U.S. banknotes at the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
At the same time it is becoming easier for the lay person to authenticate genuine U.S. currency.
U.S. Secret Service counterfeit seizures have occurred as a result of these counterfeit deterrence efforts.
1996 Series Security Features:
1.
Larger portraits make the 1996 Series more recognizable.
The off-center portrait reduces wear on the portrait from folding bills.
2.
Fine-line printing patterns are found behind the portrait and around the illustration on the back of the bill - making it more difficult to reproduce.
3.
There is a watermark portrait in the open area of each bill which is visible against light, but difficult for the counterfeiter to reproduce.
4.
A numeral with color-shifting ink (except the $5 note) is located in the lower right hand corner on the face of the bill; the ink appears to change from black to green and back when shifted.
5.
Micro printing which does not meet current copier/printer resolution is found in the side borders, around numbers in the lower left area, in the oval surrounding the portrait, and on the portrait subject's clothing with the words (in respective bills) "Five Dollars", "USA TEN", and "USA 100", etc., and "The United States of America".
6.
A polymer security thread which glows under ultraviolet light is embedded vertically in the note; with each denomination glowing different color.
The $5 note glows blue, the $10 note glows orange, the $20 note glows green, the $50 note glows yellow, and the $100 note glows red.
7.Each note has a The Federal Reserve Bank seal, and indicates which Federal Reserve Bank location issued the note.
8.
An additional digit has been added to serial numbers in the 1996 series.
A total of eleven numbers plus a letter appears twice on the face of the note.
9.
Large, high contrast numbers clearly showing the denomination are located in the lower right-hand corner on the reverse side of the note, making it easier for the elderly and low-vision persons to read.
This highly visible feature is found in $5, $10, and $20 bills.
