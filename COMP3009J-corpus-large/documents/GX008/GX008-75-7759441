SMALL FARMS: SUCCESS STORIES / IMPACTS __________________________________________________________________ ARKANSAS The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) Small Farm Project provides technical assistance to approximately 300 minority and limited resource farmers in The Arkansas Delta.
This technical assistance consisted of helping farmers complete more than 100 farm loan applications (70 percent were funded) and providing record keeping, marketing, and crop production assistance.
In 1995, The Small Farm Project was very successful in helping a group of farmers solve a drainage problem.
The area affected approximately 500 acres of cropland with annual losses estimated at $45,000.
To solve the problem, a UAPB Farm Advisor worked with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the county judge, and the seven owners of the land with the drainage problem.
After arranging several meetings between these groups and meeting with individual landowners several times, the farm advisor had a solution to the problem.
The county judge decided that cleaning the ditches could solve part of the problem.
The county judge then obtained the elevation and grade shots of the area from the NRCS Office and the county road crew began digging out the ditches.
Consequently, the area with the now road ditches has helped farmers to reclaim their valuable cropland.
In 1995, farmers in the Delta Area of Arkansas experienced a drought.
Many farmers without irrigation lost a considerable amount of income and since most minority and limited resource farmers lack irrigation, many experienced a 50 to 70 percent loss.
However, through the effort of the project staff, several small farmers who had added vegetables to their operation received income from their vegetables before the drought started.
The addition of vegetables to these farms accounted for approximately 40 percent of their income that would have been lost if they had not diversified.
Consequently, the addition of vegetables helped these farms in 1995.
Although 1995 was a very dry year, the project had one dry land farmer that increased his income by approximately $90,000.
This farmer was almost denied a loan two years earlier because of low yields, however, a farm advisor intervened and requested that county average yields be used to figure his income projections.
With assistance in crop production, marketing, and record keeping, this farmer was able to pay all current and past debts and put money in the bank.

CALIFORNIA - SMALL FARM MARKETING INNOVATIONS
BACKGROUND: While much of the effort of the University of California's Small Farm Program is directed at production related concerns, marketing has been identified as a major challenge for California's small farms.
Thus, the Small Farm Program has directed an increasing proportion of Its effort to marketing innovations that broaden or deepen the market for the products of California's small farmers.
Two of those approaches are grower marketing associations and community or consumer supported agriculture.
GROWER MARKETING ASSOCIATIONS
One grower marketing association developed in Sonoma County as a result of the organizational work of Paul Vossen, a horticulturist and member of the Small Farm work group.
It involved the development of a cooperative spirit among former independent operators.
Growers from various commodity areas would contribute to the creation of a representative marketing organization with a small infrastructure and larger grower membership.
The organization would help to create a common thematic identity for these diverse products in order to exploit niches opened up by means of the marketing efforts of the organization.
OUTCOME: The effort was highly successful, culminating in the development and establishment of the Sonoma County Agricultural Marketing Program - SCAMP.
SCAMP created a thematic logo and sponsored a series of successful promotional efforts -product ratings, advertising and promotion, besides providing individualized marketing services to many of its members.
Numbers of growers and marketers have taken workshops on the various facets of marketing, including the development and marketing of value-added products.
SCAMP has given a new face to agriculture in Sonoma County beyond increasing the marketing skills of its members - growers and marketers.
The SCAMP template subsequently provided inspiration for the development of "Placer Grown" - a similar effort at aggregating the individual efforts of dispersed farmers.
Small Farm Workgroup members were instrumental in the development of PlacerGrown, and similar to SCAMP, PlacerGrown has adopted its own logo and has co-sponsored a number of educational activities geared at increasing the marketing effectiveness of its grower and marketer members.
Its conference in January `96 attracted 300 growers and marketers.
COMMUNITY SUPPORTED AGRICULTURE
Community supported agriculture (CSA) is a marketing approach that many California farms are using to attain or maintain economic viability.
Essentially, consuming households purchase shares in the crop of a given farm.
The farm plans production and cropping mix to meet the diverse produce needs of its subscribers.
Consumer shares, prepaid, in full or in installments, entitle households to receive a supply of produce each week for the duration of the harvest.
Advantages of this system include: a guaranteed, prepaid market; absence of market fluctuations; and cash flow.
Market risk is shared by consumer shareholders.
But beyond its purely economic advantages; CSA's development links between consumers and producers; and between town and country.
They are also an effective alternative form of marketing for smaller California growers.
ROLE OF UC SMALL FARM PROGRAM
The University of -California's Small Farm Program has been a major catalyst for the development of CSA's in California.
In 1993 it sponsored a CSA conference at LIC Davis.
It subsequently organized a conference in San Diego, CA in 1994.
In November, 1995, it cosponsored a region wide conference on Community Supported Agriculture in San Francisco.
Additionally, the Small Farm Program produced two major publications and a number of newsletter articles in its Small Farm Newsletter.
Proceedings of the CSA 1993 conference has been widely distributed.
Making the Connection: A 1995 Handbook for Producers has also been produced and distributed to producers.
A conservative estimate places the number of CSA's in California at approximately 200.
A forthcoming survey will establish current numbers and the dollar value of produce marketed through this system.

CONNECTICUT
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IMPACTS Connecticut's agricultural industry is viable and growing, with 3,427 farms located on 358,743 acres.
Farm cash receipts in 1993 were reported at $521,000, the highest for any Now England state.
The State's agricultural base is very diverse, with major industries being greenhouse and nursery, dairy, poultry, fruits and vegetables.
The Connecticut Cooperative Extension Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program involves interaction with virtually all of our agricultural audiences and is carried out across the state by Extension educators and specialists.
Since, by most standards many of the farms in Connecticut are small farms, a significant amount of our 1994-1995 IPM educational program effort involved small farms.
IPM methods were taught to 79 greenhouse/nursery growers, farmers and groundskeepers through individual, hands-on in-field full season training.
A variety of impacts were seen on 6,557 acres, including the following: Pesticide active ingredient (AJ) applied was reduced by 10,573 pounds (greater than 5 tons), which saved 1.6 pounds per acre.
This represented a 32 percent usage reduction, which translated into a cost savings to participants of $80,853.
Growers and producers maintained or increased crop quality with the following results: * 100 percent of fruit/field com/poinsettia growers maintained/increased crop quality * 75 percent of vegetable growers maintained/increased crop quality * 88 percent of sweet com growers maintained/increased crop quality * a 30 percent reduction in sweet com culls were achieved, representing a $24,002 increase in crop value * a 2.5 percent increase in popper crop yield was achieved, representing a $48,992 increase in crop value * nine on-farm field herbicide demonstration plots achieved good or excellent weed control at lower than suggested herbicide rates, with Visual evidence to convince growers to implement methods
Additionally, the IPM program achieved the following general educational results: * trained 169 ornamental/turf consultants * educated CT legislators at CT Agriculture Day and the IPM annual report * formed a CT Apple IPM advisory group trained 3,350 growers for pesticide recertification/recertification

FLORIDA
VEGETABLE PRODUCTION IN NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA
Men more than 177,000 acres of traditional row crops were taken out of production in the late 1980s, multi-county extension agent Bob Hochmuth demonstrated the value of new vegetable crops, production methods and marketing programs that have led to a dramatic turnaround for the area's distressed farm economy.
As a result farm income is up by more than $33 million in the last four years.
A survey of 50 vegetable growers in the nine county north central Florida area served by extension agent Hochmuth was conducted in 1995.
According to the grower survey,
27 percent of the respondents not producing vegetables in 1988 are producing vegetables in 1995.
Of the respondents, 33 percent indicated plans for additional increases in vegetable acreage in the near future.
Major efforts, both at the Suwannee Valley Research and Education Center and on farms, have resulted in the adoption of polyethylene mulch and drip irrigation on many of these farms.
In 1986, there was no commercial plastic mulched acreage in. the area.
Through the use of University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences demonstrations, mulched acreage of vegetables has increased to 1,500 acres in the nine primary target counties.
The 1995 survey of vegetable growers also found the following information: * Total vegetable acreage increased by 42 percent from 1988 to 1995 * Only 27 percent indicated that vegetable production was their primary source of total income * 71 percent of the growers are growing 50 acres or 1038 of vegetables each year and 7 percent have over 100 acres of vegetables annually * A total of 30 different vegetable crops were mentioned in surveys.
The crops commonly grown on several farms were watermelon, squashes (all types), southern peas, poppers, and greens * Acreage of mulched vegetable increased 49 percent from 1988 to 1995 * Drip irrigated vegetable acreage increased 70 percent from 1988 to 1995 * Soil testing is conducted regularly by 89 percent of respondents * Growers develop their fertilizer programs from the following sources: University of Florida (44 percent), fertilizer dealers (17 percent), consultants (3 percent), and a combination of sources (36 percent) * 94 percent of growers indicated they scouted their fields for pests * Several marketing methods are utilized by the growers.
Most growers use more than one method to market their vegetable crops.
The ranking based on importance is as follows: wholesale broker, local retail, U-pick, Suwannee Valley State Farmers Market, Thomasville cash market, wholesale directly to chain store * Growers indicated three equal preferences for education programs including: local meetings, area-wide short courses and trade shows, and field days * The top profitability concern among the growers was marketing related issues.
The marketing concern included: lack of dependable brokers, distance to markets, fair price for product, not being paid for a sale of product.
The second greatest concern was finding a dependable labor force, primarily for harvesting.
The third greatest concern was disease management.
Other top concerns included: government regulations, cost of chemical inputs, alternate crops, weather, lack of processors in the area.
* The top requests for future research and demonstration efforts were: weed management, alternate crops, and mosaic virus management.
Through research conducted by the University of Florida at Suwannee Valley REC in association with the American Society of Plasticulture, plastic mulch films are now thinner.
The work to evaluate high density polyethylene films in the field was conducted from 1989 to present.
The result has been introduction of high density films in the early 1990s.
Currently, 50 percent of the acreage in the target area use the thinner but stronger mulch reducing the amount of plastic used by approximately 33 percent on that acreage.
Additional work to reduce, reuse, and recycle polyethylene mulches has included: adoption of double cropping practices on mulched acreage, using degradable mulches for applicable single crop situation, developing paper mulches as an alternative mulch, and informing growers of recycling opportunities for used mulch.
Water quality and quantity are a concern in Florida.
By using drip irrigation and plastic mulch, water usage for vegetable crops can be reduced by up to 50 percent from conventional irrigation systems.
According to the 1995 survey, over 90 percent of the 1,500 acres of mulched vegetables and an additional 200 acres of unmulched acreage in the region is irrigated by drip irrigation.
This adoption has resulted in: less water usage, reduced fertilizer leaching, and reduced weed growth.
Producers using drip irrigation have been taught and have adopted improved irrigation management techniques such as: using tensiometers to schedule irrigation, using filtration and clogging prevention treatments, efficient fertilizer placement, and scheduling fertilizer.
injections.
In 1995, the use of tensiometers was demonstrated to ten growers.
By using the tensiometers as a scheduling device optimum irrigation efficiency was realized.
A grower survey indicated 27 percent of those responding had reduced fertilizer rates between 1988 and 1995.
Manure utilization is a serious environmental concern in the Suwannee Valley area as well as on a national level.
Large poultry and dairy operations are present in the target area.
Research trials and demonstrations have been conducted at the Suwannee Valley REC on eight different vegetable crops.
This information is being used to develop programs for the utilization of manure in plasticulture and vegetable crops.
Five commercial growers were assisted in developing a manure management plan for their crops.
One grower increased fruit size of cantaloupe from 6 to 7 1/2 pounds in manure plots and intends to increase manure acreage in 1996.
A now technology utilizing ion selective electrodes to measure nitrogen and potassium in plant sap emerged in the 1980's.
Research at the Suwannee Valley REC was specifically conducted on cucumber, watermelon, cantaloupe, and popper to develop a program where a farmer could use the motors to immediately determine the status of nitrogen and potassium in the crop.
This now information and technology allows a farmer to more efficiently use fertilizer, saving money and reducing needless Application of nutrients to the soil.
In 1995, seven watermelon growers cooperated in a demonstration of this technology resulting in the reduction of N and K applications by an average of 25 percent on 500 acres.
This is a savings of $10,000 for these growers in 1995 alone.
Through demonstrations and trials conducted from 1991-1995, it was determined that the crops with the most potential to be adopted on a larger scale were: sweet onions, seedless watermelon, muskmelon, broccoli, specialty poppers, and pumpkins.
These crops can be successfully grown on area farms with proper cultural practices.
The development of special market niches by the grower was stressed.
Demonstrations and trials from 1991-1995 have been useful in developing information of production practices, cultivar selection, and anticipated post concerns.
Much of this information has been summarized and provided in written reports to area county agents and interested farmers.
Many of the Suwannee Valley REC Extension reports and variety trial evaluations reported are summaries of specialty crop trials.
The information in those publications is distributed on a statewide basis and also to frequent requests in other states in the southern United States.
The numbers of reports from 1991 -1995 are summarized by specialty crops below:
Crop Number of Reports:
Muskmelon -13 Pumpkin - 7 Sweet Onion - 7 Specialty Pepper - 6 Seedless Watermelon - 4 Specialty Eggplant - 3 Calabaza Squash - 1
Since most vegetable crops are now to most growers in the Suwannee Valley area, the wide adoption of the minor vegetables would not be expected in such a relatively young industry.
However, keeping demonstrations and information available and up-to-date helps growers in the transition to some specialty vegetable crop acreage.
From 1991-1995, the following commercial acreage of specialty vegetables was initiated: sweet onions (80 acres in 1991-1993), seedless watermelon (300 acres), muskmelon (20 acres), specialty melons (5 acres), pumpkin (50 acres, Chinese vegetables (150 acres), specialty poppers (20 acres), and gourds (2 acres).
The 1995 survey of vegetable growers showed a high priority need in the area of marketing issues.
The long-term objective is to formally organize vegetable growers in north Florida into an association which will focus on marketing, promotion, and identification of future needs.

GOATS FOR A "NICHE" MARKET
SMALL FARMERS LEARN TO PRODUCE AND MANAGE MEAT
Florida A
When early recognition of the changing nature of agriculture and increasing economic pressures on the small farmer called for a creative response, Florida A
Raising goats for meat has become a viable alternative enterprise for the small farmer in Florida.
This enterprise has the potential of meeting a growing market demand in Florida for a commodity which is, at present, mostly imported from the other states.
With Extension's assistance, 250 small and potential farmers learned how to produce, manage, and market meat goats.
Up-to-date, research based information on achieving a workable balance between sustained agricultural profitability and the environment was achieved through integrated small livestock crop-based systems.
This information was disseminated through traditional extension methods to small farmers and industry personnel.
Also, small farmers received information on practices that reduce production costs, and methods for increasing the efficiency and economic viability of small Meat goat farms; thereby, promoting a diverse, potentially resilient agricultural system.
As a result of this effort, 80 small farmers started raising goats for meat as an alternative enterprise.
The increased interest in raising goats for meat can be attributed to a "niche" market, which exists among the ethnic populations and middle and upper income Floridians.
The adoption of recommended meat goat production practices enabled producers to reduce feed cost on an average of $340 per producer.
This translates into a total of $25,500 in savings.
Producers implemented appropriate management systems which involved the integration of foragebased systems (pasture, forbs, and browse plants), crop residues, and crop by-products into their year round feeding programs.
Also, goats in alternative farming systems (livestock/crop systems) enabled producers to make crop rotations economically feasible through the consumption of forage crops.
Forty-one meat goat producers were able to reduce herd health cost by $2.50 per head through alternative herd health production systems.
They were able to accomplish this through various educational programs which taught them to use alternative herd health practices.
This included reduced animal confinement, modified production systems, increased use of forages in rotational grazing programs, and improved waste management systems.

FLORIDA GROWERS INCREASE MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT
SKILLS
The Situation: There are 29,025 full- and part-time farmers in Florida.
As the number of small farms continues to increase, small farmers are looking for production alternatives for diversification and increased farm income.
However, risks accompany these alternative enterprises.
Through this program, Extension helps small farmers identify and produce alternatives and educates them in the management and marketing skills needed for success in these endeavors.
Highlights of Accomplishments: * Through vegetable production short courses and field days, Extension assisted small farmers in diversifying their crops.
For example, in Columbia County, 17 farmers have begun to grow field vegetables increasing commercial acres of 15 different crops from 125 acres to over 630 in the last four years.
In Suwannee County, from 1991 to 1995, farmers have planted over 540 acres of such crops as sweet onions, pumpkins, and jalapeno peppers.
In Bradford County, producers have planted over 150 acres of Chinese cabbage, from which they earn $250,000 annually.
* Through program such as Lake County's Blueberry Day, attended by 65 growers, Extension educated growers in producing and marketing the fruit.
In Citrus County after a blueberry marketing program, local growers formed a committee to establish a direct marketing organization.
In the meantime, three growers with 15 acres pooled fruit and took turns driving to the broker, saving 72 hours and $432.
This effort has spurred further cooperation: one grower will not purchase the tractor he planned for, that we shared a tractor with another grower.
* Through programs such as peach short courses, pruning and planting field days, persimmon field days, and grape day, Extension educated growers in variety selection, uses for the fruit and safe and effective production practices.
In Lake County, over 2,000 growers attended programs such as the Peach Meeting and the Great Grape Gathering.
On post-program survey, 90 percent of the growers said they will plant or replant with varieties developed for Florida, resulting in a savings of over $330,000.
Seventy-five percent of the growers said that with the information Extension provided, they could reduce production costs by an average of 50 percent an acre, for a total savings of $78,000.
* Extension provided information and assistance to small farmers interested in adding ornamentals to their operations.
In Columbia County, of nine now ornamental nurseries started from 1991 to 1995, four were started by small farmers.
In 1995, the nine nurseries realized over $435,00 in sales.
In Baker County, three farmers began woody ornamental nurseries that have an annual sales potential of $40,000 to $50,000.
Several small farmers in Volusia county produced 3.5 acres of cut flowers with an average return of $15,000 per acre.
A Success Story: In April 1995, an association Of small-scale growers in Washington County incorporated to become W-M Vegetable Producers Association, which would supply a local Wal-Mart with fresh vegetables.
The association delivered the first vegetables on May 2, 1995.
The reception was overwhelming from May 2 through the middle of August the association sold $45,000 worth of vegetables through the Wal-Mart, and other Wal-Marts in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama have asked to be included.
The association's agreement with Wal Mart is the first of its kind with the chain.
Wal Mart pays the association Mat it would pay a distributor, plus, in some cases, a premium for freshness.
In bypassing the wholesale brokers, the growers realize a 30 to 50 percent increase in return over normal prices.

IOWA
IOWA MASTER GARDENER PROGRAM
The Iowa Master Gardener program has seen enormous success and growth since it was developed in 1979.
In 1995, Master Gardener training was held in 22 locations with a total of 374 participants trained.
This brings the total number of counties participating to 95 of Iowa's 99 counties.
Iowa Master Gardeners reported 22,145 volunteer hours on extension sponsored, horticultural activities.
The volunteer service.
provided by the Master Gardeners was equivalent to approximately 10.5 FTEs, and over $200,000 in salary savings.
Master Gardeners assisted County Extension Staff by answering horticulture-related phone calls, sponsoring educational workshops, writing newsletters and garden columns, preparing displays for home and garden shows, assisting with farmers' markets, teaching youth gardening programs, as well as many other educational activities.
Home Horticultural Activities.
Home horticultural staff wrote 52 garden columns in 1995 that were utilized by over 100 Iowa newspapers and "shoppers".
The staff also recorded 52, four minute radio tapes and 936, two minute radio tapes that are available to over 100 radio stations throughout the state.
They also contribute articles to the Horticultural and Home Pest Newsletter in which 26 issues per year were sent to approximately 400 subscribers.
The newsletter provides current information on pest diagnosis, post management and culture of horticulture crops.
The specialists also prepared the 1996 Garden Calendar and 12 "Reiman Gardens fact sheets."
These publications are available to gardeners through the ISU Extension World Wide Web page.

FARM TRANSITIONS
Problem.
Survey data from the 1995 Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll indicated that approximately 29 percent of the current farm operators plant to quit farming by the year 2000.
Eighty-one percent of those planning to leave farming selected retirement as the reason.
This is consistent with the Census of Agriculture data which indicate that 4 out of every 10 Iowa farm operators are age 55 or older.
For these farm operators, careful estate and business planning are an immediate concern.
Many of those planning for retirement in northeast Iowa also are concerned about organizing the farm business for a smooth transition to the next generation.
Fortunately, young people in northeast Iowa are interested in pursuing careers in livestock production agriculture.
Although these young people typically do not have a great deal of equity capital coming into the business, they do bring an abundance of energy and modem management skills.
Because livestock enterprises are highly labor and management-intensive, the resources contributed by the beginning farmer are critical to the continuation of the business.
Response.
For the past two program years, Iowa State University Extension clients have identified two-generation farm transition as a top priority issue in northeast Iowa.
I planned and organized an interdisciplinary team consisting of ISUE field specialists in Farm Management, Family Life, and Family Resource Management.
Together we have implemented a long-term program in this area.
Two primary objectives are being addressed.
These are to help both parties: (1) explore the feasibility of two-generation farming and process of transferring income, management, and ownership, and (2) understand the communication and human relationship skills that are essential for successful two generation farm arrangements.
Impact.
A sequential programming approach was used to build momentum throughout the program each year.
A discussion of the program methods and client impact is provided as follows: * 500 copies of a now publication entitled, 'Two-Generation Dairy Cow Leasing" Pm1573 were distributed to dairy service providers and dairy families beginning in September 1994.
* 70 accountants, attorneys, leaders, and insurance agents attended three seminars entitled, 'Maintaining Your Agricultural Clients Now and into the Next Generation" in 1995 and 1996.
These objectives were established to assist professionals: (1) further develop their expertise and understanding of the business transition process in order to maintain and effectively with two-generation farm clients, (2) explore the two-generation farming resources, programs, and services available from ISUE, and (3) explore !he possibilities of networking with professionals who also are assisting two-generation farm clients.
* A major media campaign began six weeks before the Two-Generation Farming Workshops.
Radio PSAs were utilized and a series of five news releases dealing with two-generation transition topics were published in local newspapers.
Program brochures were produced and widely distributed.
Three half hour radio programs were produced.
* 9 two-generation Farming Workshops were hold in 1995 and 1996.
* 108 two-generation farm families were represented or 221 people.
* 90% of the participants, using an end-of-meeting evaluation, rated the meeting as excellent or superior.
* Frequent comments heard or in writing included: "This has been the Best Extension meeting I have ever attended."
* 76 people attended a farm business planning seminar with Neil Hart in March 1995.
* 77 percent of the families who attended the 1995 and 1996 winter workshops requested individual follow-up assistance.
* 32 families completed a six month follow-up evaluation in 1995:
1.
97 percent would recommend the workshop to others 2.
92 percent could recognize the four transfer stages of the FARM-ON Model 3.
85 percent developed an understanding of essential communication and conflict resolution skills for a successful two-generation arrangement 4.
79 percent feel they have increased their ability to assess the feasibility of farming together successfully 5.
65 percent have worked on establishing personal and business goals 6.
51 additional two-generation farm families have contacted me for assistance having seen or heard something about the workshops

NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT ON A SMALL ACREAGE
In 1994, Alice Moody, Iowa State University Extension (ISUE) Integrated Crop Management Scout for central Iowa and her husband, Dave, had their 40 acre farmstead near Nevada tested for plant-available phosphorus, potassium and soil pH.
They have a large swine confinement operation on this farmstead, with manure from the buildings stored in an earthen lagoon.
In addition to applying lagoon manure yearly, they had been adding commercial phosphate, potash and nitrogen to the cropland.
At this time, they also sampled nutrients from the lagoon by placing buckets under the manure application system (a moving hydraulic gun).
Four soil samples we taken according to soil type.
Percent organic matter ranged from 2.8 to 4.7.
Soil pH ranged from 6.8 to 7.8.
Phosphorus levels ranged from 20 (a Harps soil, with a soil pH of 7.8) to 124 (very high).
All four potassium levels were very high, ranging from 200 to 300.
Based on this information, the Moody's have stopped purchasing commercial fertilizer, with the exception of nitrogen applied to the corn crop (corn-soybean rotation the last 2 years.
It had previously been planted to continuous corn).
They apply nitrogen based on a realistic yield goal of 160 bushels per acre, after taking credits from the previous year's soybean crop (normally 50 pounds) and nitrogen credits from the lagoon manure.
Dave and Alice recognize the value of swine manure in reducing input costs of crop production.
An average of 0-110-120 (nitrogen - phosphate - potash) commercial fertilizer applied every other year costs approximately $21 per year, or $840 when, applied over 40 acres.
The Moody's have reduced their yearly crop production costs by $840.
This also reduced the nutrient load on the environment

SWINE PRODUCTION FACILITIES REMODELED
A swine producer was considering building a now finishing barn.
After an evaluation of current facilities by Extension staff, it was discovered that a pole barn previously used to finish cattle was not being used.
After a building evaluation by the Extension Specialist Ag. Engineering, it was decided that the building could be remodeled to house finishing pigs.
The building floor was cemented and cement walls four feet high was added for pen dividers.
A hay loft was placed over the sleeping area of the pigs.
It is now used for hay storage and as insulation for the pigs sleeping area.
The building was remodeled for less than half the cost of a new building.
Recently, the farmer stated that the building was working very good and does not require much bedding.
The building houses 250 head of hogs and costs less than $5,000 to remodel.

FRUIT, VEGETABLE, ORNAMENTAL AND TREE PRODUCERS AND THE WORKER PROTECTION STANDARD
The Worker Protection Standard went into effect January 1, 1995.
It is designed to protect agricultural workers from pesticide exposure.
The Standard affects applicators of pesticides that are involved in the production of agricultural plants on a farm, forest, nursery and greenhouse.
Under the Worker Protection Standard, applicators of both general and restricted-use pesticides are required to comply.
In Iowa, only applicators of restricted-use pesticides are required to be certified and they are easily updated about changes in the law.
Typically, small farmers are not certified and therefore have poor access to this legal information.
To provide an update to general-use pesticide applicators about the Worker Protection Standard, we hold a satellite downlink to county extension offices in April to update growers of vegetables, ornamentals, fruits and Christmas trees.
This one and one-half hour program provided general information about the Standard, discussed training resources for employees and interviewed growers about some of the methods they use for complying .
Information about the program was sent to over 3,000 individuals, including many small growers that may have family member employees or very small groups of field workers.
Copies of the program videotape were made for each county office for those that could not attend the program.

IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION HAS POSITIVE IMPACT ON SMALL FARMERS
PROBLEM.
Agriculture in Iowa is rapidly changing.
Rural population continues to decline' but populations within commuting distance of many metropolitan areas are booming.
Many acreage owners and traditional farmers are seeking alternate ways to earn a living from their land.
Horticulture is a logical choice for many small farmers and acreage owners because fewer acres can generate higher profits.
According to the Bureau of Iowa Statistics, horticulture is the fastest growing segment of Iowa agriculture and interest in it is rapidly increased.
However, some people don't have much knowledge or experience in commercial production or marketing of horticultural crops or services.
Many need assistance.
RESPONSE.
Iowa State University Extension (ISUE) is helping many small farmers achieve their horticultural business goals.
To help meet the growing need, ISUE offers programs for commercial horticulture clients.
These are accessible at county, area and state levels.
Hands-on demonstrations and field days are available at various locations.
Commercial horticultural publications and referrals are easy to got at local county ISUE offices.
Three Commercial Horticulture Field Specialists provide help from one-on-one consultation and on-site visits.
ISUE provides the practical skills needed to put research based knowledge to work.
IMPACT.
Hundreds of clients receive commercial horticulture help from ISUE each year.
The following unsolicited electronic mail (dated July 17, 1996, and included here with the clients permission), illustrates the valuable impacts that ISUE is having on individuals who are starting horticulture enterprises.
Dear Dr. Everhart:
Thank you for the many suggestions that you offered me in this past year.
Your suggestions for attending the container nursery seminar was most valuable to me in deciding which way I should proceed with the idea of tree farming.
The information that I received along with the supporting documentation that you provided me with, has already saved me numerous hours of research in plant selection, post control and timing to market.
Based on the information you provided, I have decided that it is cost-effective for me to go into the specialty vegetable market at this time.
As you suggested, and as I have said to you in the past, I take the time to do my homework before I got started.
In helping me to do this, you are and have been a valued resource.
As I have mentioned to you, every time I've reached out to my local Extension office, be it for information on trees, vegetables, irrigation or anything on local farming, it seems I have to keep coming back to you for the practical help I need.
If I had to put a time saving tag on the service you have provided me, it would-be hundreds of hours.
I don't know what a horticulture consultant charges, but I know I could not afford to pay independently for the service you have provided me.
Thank you again for taking the time to share your ideas with me.
Sincerely yours, Floyd Robert, Owner Li Georgia Boy Farm Produce 3400 1 80th Street Woodbine, IA
This is a typical example of a new small farmer.
This is also a client who is willing to express his satisfaction with the commercial horticulture help he is receiving from ISUE.
Like a growing number of others, he lives on an acreage and commutes to Omaha every day.
He is also a member of a minority and would like to grow and market specialty produce.
His short term goal is to supplement his income with on-farm earnings.
In the next few years, he plans to become a full-time horticulture entrepreneur.
ISUE is helping him to gain the knowledge and experience he will need to be successful.
Although his is currently a small farmer, he may not be small for long.

EDUCATION ON CROP ROTATION REDUCES NITROGEN FERTILIZER USE BY $300,000 IN NORTHEAST IOWA
PROBLEM.
The use of nitrogen fertilizers by farmers and corresponding non-point source pollution of nitrogen to Iowa rivers and drinking water supplies continues to be one of the largest problems facing farmers today.
One answer to this problem is to refine nitrogen management in farm systems that include alfalfa in the crop rotations.
RESPONSE.
This last winter approximately 2,700 producers from six counties in northeast Iowa attended the private pesticide continuing instruction courses.
Nitrogen management was among the topics discussed at these courses.
The producers attending the courses represented approximately 130,000 acres of alfalfa production in northeast Iowa.
Prior to the courses, the average nitrogen credit producers used for com following alfalfa was 50 pounds per acre.
Approximately 10 percent said that they already use the 'full" credit, another 60 percent used only one-half of the suggested credit, and the other 30 percent claimed to not take any credit.
The Iowa State University Extension Crop Specialist presented data from 30 Iowa State University Extension on-farm research trials conducted across northeast Iowa over the last 10 years to convince producers of the value of the nitrogen fertilizer credit from alfalfa in crop rotation with com.
From the research, data it was made evident to the producers that alfalfa provides between 100 and 140 pounds of equivalent nitrogen credit per acre for the subsequent com crop.
The producers were impressed with the results of the 30 research trials conducted in their region of the state, and that the alfalfa equivalent nitrogen fertilizer credit was valued at $20 to $28 per acre.
IMPACT.
Upon concluding the courses, the Extension Crop Specialist verbally surveyed producers as to their intentions on using proper nitrogen credit for com following alfalfa.
Approximately 50 percent said that they would use the 'full" equivalent nitrogen fertilizer credit, 30 percent would increase their nitrogen fertilizer credit to about 80 pounds per acre, and 20 percent were still a little skeptical but would try some demonstrations on their own farm to convince themselves as to what they think is appropriate for their farm.
Approximately one-half of the 130,000 acres of alfalfa was to be rotated to other crops in 1996, and about 80 percent of that acreage would be rotated to com.
By utilizing the above survey data, producers will be reducing their commercial N fertilizer purchases for this com acreage by an average of $300,000 in the six counties in northeast Iowa.

NEBRASKA
SMALL FARM IMPACT REPORT
An annual Acreage/Small Farmer Owner Workshop was developed to address the educational needs of this rapidly growing population.
Many individuals wish to enjoy the acreage lifestyle, but lack the knowledge or experience to maintain this type of property.
As one workshop participant said, "We are now better prepared to properly and efficiently develop our country living environment."
Approximately 400 participants, representing eleven Nebraska counties, attend this program annually.
Workshop agendas are designed to respond to common concerns of small farm audiences and address emerging issues.
Program topics have included beekeeping, exploring specialty enterprises, pond maintenance, controlling wildlife damage, management of grassland, horse management and care, assessing land resources, septic and lagoon systems, poultry, swine, cattle, sheep, goats, evaluating private well water quality, building wildlife habitat, organic farming, acreage equipment safety, landscaping the acreage, weed control and windbreak design.
A random telephone survey of participants revealed the following impacts occurred following the 1995 workshop.
Seventy-five percent of workshop participants had their private well water quality tested.
Sixty-six percent of participants inspected their septic systems.
Fifty percent indicated they began using integrated post management strategies for weed control.
Twenty-five percent planted wildlife habitat in the form of either food plots or trees.
A similar evaluation will be conducted to evaluate the 1996 workshop.
The Acreage/Small Farm Owner Workshop is offered on a Saturday in the month of March.
We have observed numerous, young couples that are relatively unfamiliar with Cooperative Extension participating in this workshop.
Many of our 1996 participants were repeated customers from the 1995 workshop.
Another University of Nebraska Cooperative Extension effort to reach acreage/small farm audiences is the development of the NUFACTS; Information Center.
NUFACTS offers individuals access to over 450 hotline messages and 425 of our most popular Extension publications 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
NUFACTS responded to over 1,500 message requests in its first three weeks of operation.
NUFACTS is especially attractive to limited resource families, commuter audiences and individuals dud cannot access the Extension office during normal business hours.

NEW JERSEY
THE 1995 RUTGERS FARM BUSINESS MANAGEMENT MARKETING TRAINING AND INFORMATION PROGRAM
Objective: Farmers need management marketing, financial and planning skills to survive in a highly competitive business environment.
The Farm Business Management/Marketing Training and Information Program was developed to address these needs by providing in-depth training to enable farmers to gain the knowledge and skills to plan and meet their financial, business and family goals.
Thus keeping New Jersey's farm industries competitive, innovative, productive and viable in today's and future global economy.
BACKGROUND: For a second year, Rutgers' Cook/Now Jersey Agricultural Extension Service (NJAES) received an Agricultural Economic Recovery Development Initiative (AERDI) grant from ft Now Jersey Department of Agriculture's (NJDA) Division of Rural Resources to continue teaching New Jersey farmers and producers progressive or innovative business management and marketing techniques designed to improve, modernize, and keep agriculture in Now Jersey viable and competitive.
The NJDA also gave Production Efficiency Grants (PEG) to 663 Now Jersey farmers in 1995.
PEG was given to farmers to invest in projects which: (1) improve farm management practices, (2) make conservation and natural resource improvements, (3) implement new technology, (4) improve and expand farm marketing facilities, and (5) offer other opportunities to increase farm income and profitability.
Although the 663 PEG recipients were required to take a minimum of three hours of farm business management and marketing from Cook/NJAES, over 1,240 farmers attended the 47 training sessions throughout the State.
The training program was also open to all New Jersey farmers.
Developing these 47 farms business and marketing training sessions, required collaboration and coalition building with departments within Cook/NJAES, and 30 other agricultural and non-agricultural organizations.
This effective utilization of resources and knowledge from the team enabled Rutgers' Cook/NJAES to effectively and successfully deliver a very informative, concise, and thought provoking farm business management and marketing training program to the farm industry.
PROJECT: The AERDI grant called the Rutgers Farm Business Management/Marketing Training and Information Program (the Training Program) directed by Dr. Robin Brumfield, consisted of two components: the Farm Business Management/Marketing Training Program; and an On-Line Market Information Database, and Hot-Line Information System.
Frances Adelaja, Program Associate in Farm Management, coordinated and implemented both the Farm Business Management/Marketing Training program and the On-Line and Hot-Line database systems.
Two separate advisory committee convened for each component of the Training Program.
For the Farm Business Management/Marketing Training Program component, a farm training advisory committee consisting of representatives from Rutgers Cooperative Extension, the Rutgers New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, Farm Bureau, First Pioneer Farm Credit ACA, USDA-Farm Service Agency, Small Business Administrations, and other agricultural and non-agricultural organizations was organized to identify the subject areas that would be immediately useful to farmers.
The committee recommended that training in farm business management should be concentrated in six core subject areas: Labor Management, Financial Management, Estate Planning, Owning and Using Property, Management, and Marketing.
From these six core subject areas came 47 multiple training sessions offered during the 1995-96 period.
The 47 multiple Farm Business Management/Marketing Training courses were hold from the fall of 1995 through spring of 1996 and resulted in nearly 4,900 contact hours with farmers.
The training course included: Estate Planning; Computerized Record Keeping Accounting Software (Quick Books, Quicken, Quick Play) , Strategic Planning, Identifying Farm and Family Foals, Pre-Retirement Planning, Managing Farm Record Finances (Balance Sheet and Income Statements), Financial Reporting and Analysis in Agriculture, Analyzing the Farm Operation Using Whole-Farm Budgeting and Partial Farm Budgeting, Labor Management, Agricultural On-Line Information, Computer Basics, Agricultural Marketing on the Internet, Supplementary Income Opportunities, Crop Insurance, Positioning Your Diary For The Future, General Marketing, Horticultural Marketing, Grain Marketing with futures, and other programs tailored to specific commodities.
For the On-Line database services and Hot-Line Information systems, component of the Training Program, an advisory committee consisting of representatives from the NJDA, the USDA, Farm Bureau, farmers, and other professional organizations' personnel was convened to identify information needed on both the database and hot-line information system.
The On-Line database, which can be accessed twenty-four hours a day, allows farmers, agents, specialists, NJDAIUSDA personnel, and other agricultural information users direct computer access to commodity prices, at terminal markets, shipping points, future markets, and prices and volume information at the Vineland Auction.
The Hot-Line Information systems provide telephone access to RCE technical reports, technical information, marketing information, and crop information.
The system allows a user to request information by pressing buttons on their touch-tone telephones as directed by a recorded voice.
These documents are then sent via fax to the phone location requested.
This Fax-On-Demand and fax broadcast operation is designed to improve communication between the agricultural community and Rutgers University.
IMPACT: The program has been very well received.
Over 1,240 farmers participated in the 1995 Rutgers Farm Business Management/Marketing Training and Information Program hold at Cook Campus, at Cook/NJAES off-campus research centers, at RCE county offices, at non-agricultural buildings, and in conjunction with commodity group meetings.
Although PEG recipients were required to take only 3 hours of training, many of the farmers attended additional training sessions.
The following are a summary outcome of the Training Program: * 47 farm business management/marketing training sessions were hold.
* Over 1,240 farmers attended these training sessions.
* The training sessions resulted in 4,900 contact hours.
* 54 speakers conducted the 47 training sessions.
* Over 30 agricultural and non-agricultural agencies worked to deliver a very successful training program.
* 13,423 informational faxes were faxed directly to the farmer and agriculture support persons.
* 1,959 agricultural constituents logged-in to the AERDI On-Line agricultural database.
This figure does not cover the over 200 Rutgers' Cook College accounts (Agents, specialist, researchers and administrators), or NJDA, and other Rutgers accounts that log onto the system.
* 16,893 agricultural constituents phoned-in for agricultural news recordings.
* 104 Kermit disks and instruction sheets were sent out to users.
* 27 talks and demonstrations were given on the On-Line and Fax information systems.
* 6 publications were released as, a result of this the Information Program.
Participants at the sessions also gave glowing evaluations of the Training Program.
Most attendees rated the course good to excellent and would recommend the program to an associate.
The following are some of the course comments from the formal evaluation sheet:
"Best seminar I have attended in my 20 years in the industry",
"More than I expected", "One of the best classes I have ever attended",
"The program is a home run", "Very well done and informative",
"I though I would already know the information being presented-I was wrong"
"Keep up the good work", "Worthwhile attending", Very good",
"Time went by in a friendly and relaxed environment"
"I enjoyed my three hours of class.
Made me want to take more classes"
"Thanks", "Inspiring, motivating, and useful information"
"Was highly informative", "More classes", "Great"
Most of the participants rated the speakers "excellent to good" and said the pace of the course was "about right."

NEW YORK
PUMPKIN SPACING
The Need - The Capital District is a major pumpkin producing area on the east coast, producing a crop worth $5-7 million annually.
Many factors affect profitable pumpkin production.
Despite pumpkins being a major income producer in the Capital District and in the state of New York, essentially no work has been conducted in the past concerning issues affecting pumpkin production.
One piece of information that has been sorely missed by growers is recommendations concerning the optimum spacing for pumpkin plants.
Spacing recommendations have been determined for almost every major vegetable crop in New York State.
Because of the rapidly expanding acreage, and the economic importance of the crop, spacing recommendations are needed to allow growers to maximize the efficiency of their crop inputs which will result in maximized profits.
Extension's Response - Funding was obtained from the Pennsylvania Vegetable Marketing Association to conduct applied field research to investigate the optimum spacing for a vining variety and bush variety of pumpkin.
Research plots were established on the farm of a Capital District vegetable grower and at the NYS Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva.
Three spacing treatments were combined with three fertilizer treatments in the plots in both locations.
The results were presented at a grower meeting concerning pumpkin production in late September.
The Results - Results from the research in the Capital District indicated that wider spacing resulted in larger, but fewer pumpkin fruit.
Total yield per acre did not change over the three treatments.
Growers indicated that based on the research results, they would be experimenting with different pumpkin spacing on their farm in 1996.
Some growers will be widening their current spacing, some will be reducing their current spacing.
This will lead to Capital District growers adjusting their spacing to produce the size of pumpkin that their customers desire, in turn leading to higher profitability.
PUMPKIN FRUIT SET
The Need - The Capital District is a major pumpkin producing area on the east coast, producing a crop worth $54 million annually.
Many factors affect profitable pumpkin production.
Despite pumpkins being a major income producer in the Capital District and in the state of New York, essentially no work has been conducted in the past concerning issues affecting pumpkin production.
Capital
District, growers have had years with poor to fair fruit on the pumpkin crop, but there were no
District available answers for why a field had poor fruit set.
Extension's Response - Funding was obtained from the Pennsylvania Vegetable Marketing Association to conduct applied field research to investigate the possible causes of poor fruit set.
Research was conducted in the pumpkin fields of five Capital District growers.
The research results were shared with growers at the Capital District pumpkin meeting held in late September.
The Results - Research results indicated that the fruit set problems experienced by Capital 4District vegetable growers in 1995 were not due to pollination or fertilization problems as growers thought, but by high temperatures at a critical time of female flower development.
Research conducted in the grower fields clearly indicated that as long as pollen transfer occurred, fruit set usually followed.
However, plants grown in greenhouse temperatures of 90 degrees fair and height during the, day and 70 degrees fair and height at night resulted in aborted female flowers and consequently, no fruit set.
Growers at the pumpkin meeting indicated that prior to the meeting, they had little understanding of the factors affecting fruit set.
After the meeting, they clearly understood the factors involved in fruit set.
In addition, -they learned how to quickly assess the degree of pollination occurring in a field.
They now feel confident determining if they have a pollination problem in their field versus a physiological response to heat.
As research continues, this knowledge can be further utilized to adjust inputs such as fertilizer and irrigation to reduce the likelihood of poor fruit set Consequently, the probability of adequate to good fruit set should increase, improving the profit margins of Capital District pumpkin growers.
SOIL HEALTH AND QUALITY
The Need - Typical vegetable farms in the Capital District consist of well-drained to excessively drained soils with low organic matter and low water holding capacity.
Intensive production on these soils over many years is leading to a decline in soil quality.
Soil quality has a district relationship to production capacity.
Soil organic matter content influences soil quality.
Cover crops can reduce the decline in organic matter contents in Capital District soils.
Because of the need to capture the early market, Capital District vegetable growers traditionally have not utilized cover crops to their fullest capacity.
Cover crops other than the traditional winter rye need to be investigated to determine if they fit into vegetable production systems in the Capital District.
Extension's Response - A grant was obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program to test multiple species of cover crops under Capital District conditions.
Seven summer cover crops were planted in May on a vegetable farm and were evaluated throughout the summer for ease of establishment, biomass production and their ability to compete with weeds.
Five fall cover crops were planted in September and were evaluated for ease of establishment and early ability to compete with weeds.
Evaluations of biomass production and final weed competition of the fall planted cover crops will be evaluated in the spring.
A grower twilight meeting was held at the plots in August Growers examined the plots and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each cover crop.
Growers also indicated which cover crops they believe need further research.
The Results - Growers indicated an increased interest in the use of cover crops in a vegetable cropping rotation.
Four specific cover crops were identified by g rowers as possibilities for their cover cropping needs and more research will be conducted on those in 1996.1" Growers also indicated they did not realize there is an expanded selection of cover cropping possibilities, including ones which may work as a "niche" cover crop between spring and fall vegetable crops.
Overall, the awareness of vegetable growers concerning the importance of using cover crops and the options available to them was heightened.
NON-ORGANIC/ORGANIC FARMER CONNECTION
The Need - Capital District vegetable growers are.
an extremely diverse group of people.
They vary in size from 1/2 acre to 700 acres; marketing techniques vary from large scale wholesale to very small direct marketing; and they vary in philosophy of production techniques from strict adherence to organic techniques to sustainable techniques to conventional techniques.
Growers from the ends of the spectrum have traditionally not communicated with each other on a regular basis, even though they share many issues of mutual concern.
Extension's Response - To bring vegetable growers of all philosophies together, a summer series of four twilight meetings on organic farms was hold.
These meetings were attended by over 100 vegetable growers.
Owners of each farm gave a tour of their farm, discussed production techniques, and demonstrated equipment that they have developed on their farms.
Additionally, they discussed their labor management techniques, marketing techniques, and costs of production.
The Results - All growers attending the meetings had an enthusiastic response to learning from each other, regardless of philosophy in production techniques.
Growers from all production philosophies shared with each other different ways of approaching common problems.
Growers from all ends of the spectrum commented after the meetings that they had not previously thought about how much all growers had in common, regardless of their philosophy.
A dialogue that did not previously exist has been established between growers of all philosophies.
As these tours continue over time, this dialogue will continue and will serve to strengthen the entire industry.
DIRECT MARKETING ALTERNATIVES
The Need - A high percentage of Capital District vegetable farms market directly to Capital District consumers and visitors to the area.
Direct marketers have found themselves competing to a greater degree with the large supermarkets.
Their competitor is no longer the farm down the road, but the superstore in the neighborhood.
To remain competitive in these changing times, direct marketers must explore marketing alternatives and the possibility of working together as an entire industry.
Extension's Response - The Capital District Area Vegetable Program created the Direct Marketer's Breakfast Group.
The group met once a month and discussed topics of mutual concern affecting direct marketing.
Programs included: Exploring Group Advertising,
Is Community Supported Agriculture for You?, Recruiting and Training Employees for Farm Markets, Should You Start a Salad Bar in Your Farm Market?, and Creating a Financial Plan for Your Farm.
The Results - Capital District direct marketers started to form a core group of marketers who are ordering some supplies together and learning to work together as an industry.
These growers have traditionally viewed each other as competitors.
They are gradually learning that it is to their benefit to work together, rather than against each other.
The Capital District vegetable industry will be a more robust industry as more growers learn to work with each other, rather than against each other.
STAKED TOMATOES
The Need - Fresh market tomatoes are widely grown on Capital District vegetable farms.
Yield potential of locally grown tomatoes is high, yet rarely attained due to losses from fruit rot Mere fruit lay on the ground.
Training tomatoes with stakes and twine to stay upright improves fruit size and decreases rot since fruit do not touch the ground.
Even though labor costs are increased substantially, net profits can be higher due to increased numbers of marketable fruit and higher quality fruit which demands a premium price.
Extension's Response - All Capital District vegetable growers received New York research results demonstrating the benefits of growing staked tomatoes.
Research results were delivered through the Capital Vegetable News and demonstrated increased early yields (Men prices received for the crop are higher) and a greatly increased percentage of number one fruit over second grade and cull fruit.
Number one fruit also brings higher prices.
One-on-one farm visits allowed growers to loam how to construct training systems and to learn how to properly prune plants for training systems.
The Results - In 1992, one grower in the Capital District produced staked tomatoes.
All other growers were skeptical of the technique.
In 1995, a minimum of twenty Capital District growers grow staked tomatoes.
All growers using the technique report drastically improved quality and percentage of number one fruit.
All report that higher labor costs are more than offset by improved returns, leading to increased not profits.
Capital District consumers are benefiting from receiving higher quality produce, for a longer period of time, at reasonable prices.
DRIP IRRIGATION AND FERTIGATION
The Need - Typical vegetable farms in the Capital District consist of well-drained to excessively drained soils with low organic matter and low water holding capacity.
These soils are highly susceptible to leaching of plant nutrients, resulting in reduced yields and possibly posing problems for groundwater quality.
Technological innovations have enabled drip irrigation systems to evolve over the last fifteen years, drastically reducing their cost, and allowing growers to inject fertilizer through the system (fertigation).
Fertigation provides an easy to use, efficient system to apply the least amount of fertilizer necessary to produce a high quality crop.
Some Capital District vegetable growers expressed an interest in drip irrigation, but had too many questions concerning economics, set-up, operation, advantages, and disadvantages to feel comfortable investing in drip irrigation and fertigation on their farms.
Extension's Response - USDA Water Quality grants were obtained in 1993 and 1994 to set up drip irrigation and fertigation demonstrations on a Capital District vegetable farm.
A drip irrigation system was installed and demonstrated.
Additionally, four fertilizer regimes were compared to the standard grower practice of pre-plant fertilizer with one side-dressing and overhead irrigation.
Yields and quality were measured during the production seasons and twilight meetings were hold each year.
During the twilight meetings, growers viewed the system in operation, discussed results of the fertilizer treatments, learned how to operate the fertilizer injection system, and learned how to calculate amounts of fertilizer and water to apply to utilize the system at top efficiency.
The same topics were delivered to all Capital District vegetable growers through the Capital Vegetable News.
The Results - The demonstrations clearly illustrated the advantages of using a drip irrigation system in conjunction with fertigation.
When this educational program was initiated, one Capital District vegetable grower was utilizing drip irrigation.
In August of 1995, thirty-two Capital District vegetable growers were using drip irrigation.
Eighty percent of those growers were using fertigation in conjunction with drip irrigation.
At least seven additional growers have indicated they will have a drip irrigation system in place for the 1996 growing season.
Capital District vegetable growers have increased their production efficiency, quality, and yields, resulting in increased profits.
Capital District consumers are able to purchase high quality fresh vegetables at reasonable prices which have been produced with environmentally sound Methods.
SOIL COMPACTION
The Need - Typical vegetable farms in the Capital District consist of well-drained to excessively drained soils with low organic matter and low water holding capacity.
Intensive production on these soils over many years is leading to a decline in production.
Many factors are contributing to this decline, but the composition of the soils is conducive to plow pan formation.
Plow pans effectively reduce rooting depths from between two to three feet to ten inches or less.
These reduced rooting depths are decreasing the efficiency of crop inputs such as water and fertilizers, leading to reduced yields and reduced profits.
Extension's Response - A grant was obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program.
Through this funding, a survey was conducted on Capital District vegetable farms to determine the extent of plow pans. -Essentially every vegetable farms with lighter soils such as sandy loans had plow pans in 25-100% of their fields.
Two fields on one vegetable farm were sub-soiled to demonstrate the use of a single shank sub-soiled and to follow plant growth through the season.
A twilight meeting was held in September at which growers saw a demonstration of the single shank sub-soiler, learned the depth to operate a sub-soiler, and learned how frequently sub-soiling should be done.
They also discussed and demonstrated ways to determine if a plow pan problem exists on their farm.
The Results - At the beginning of the grower meeting, all vegetable growers were asked W a sandy loam soil could have a plow pan compaction problem.
One hundred percent of the growers indicated that it could not AJI growers were then given a penetrometer to use (which measures soil compaction) and asked to examine a soil pit that had been dug in a field with a plow pan.
These two exercises illustrated to all growers attending that a plow pan did exist despite it being a soil that they believed would not have a plan pan compaction problem.
AJI growers left the meeting with a greater awareness of the potential for plan pan compaction on their farm, how to measure it, and methods to ameliorate it.

OKLAHOMA
SMALL FARMS: 1995 OKLAHOMA SUCCESS STORIES
Aquaculture is almost exclusively a small farm enterprise in Oklahoma.
It has not been blessed with a single large region, like the Mississippi Delta, in which water supply and soil conditions are uniformly well suited to the construction of fish culture ponds.
Traditional neighbor to neighbor diffusion of technology does not allow for development of an aquaculture industry due to the diffuse geographical distribution of suitable conditions.
Extension professionals worked to overcome this problem through individual feasibility assessments and other means.
Several established fish farms underwent expansion during 1995, thanks in part to technical support supplied by Extension professional.
However, the -short term economic impact of dollars saved by prospective aquaculturists who were advised of serious problems by Extension professionals before they committed funds was more significant.
Forty-five prospective small farm aquaculturist3 were assisted by the Area Extension Aquaculture Specialist with an equal number estimated to have been assisted by county Extension professionals.
Roughly 95 percent were advised of problems serious enough to make their planned fish production systems uneconomical.
The amount of dollars saved per individual client advised of serious deficiencies was estimated to be $30,000 based on an estimate published by the Southern Regional Aquaculture Center.
It can be further estimated that approximately half of those seeking information were unlikely to invest funds regardless of the information received.
Altogether an estimated $1,283,000 was saved by clients who avoided investing in unfeasible fish farming production systems during 1995.

FARM POND MANAGEMENT: ASSISTANCE RENDERED
The number of farm ponds in Oklahoma has been estimated to be as high as 800,000.
A very large percentage are associated with small farms and represent a considerable asset in terms of recreation, livestock watering, wildlife habitat and aesthetics to small farm owners.
Expert assistance rendered to small farm owners by Extension professionals during 1995 falls into four main categories: fish health, including fish kills, aquatic plant management: construction and maintenance, and fish stocking and management
The impacts that follow are based upon client contacts made by the Area Extension Aquaculture Specialist and an estimate of the number of calls handled by county Agricultural Extension Agents.
* Forty-eight clients experiencing fish health problems or fish kills were assisted.
* One hundred and thirty-eight individuals received advice on short and long term control measures for aquatic plant problems.
* Seventeen clients were assisted with pond construction and maintenance problems.
* Twenty-seven individuals obtained information on pond fish stocking, harvest limits and other fish management methods.
* The total estimated value of pond management improvements made by small farm operators as a result of guidance provided by Extension professional was $374,000.

PEANUT PRODUCTION
Peanut leafspot is a very costly disease of Oklahoma peanut farmers.
In the past, peanuts have been sprayed with a fungicide as often as every two weeks from shortly after planting until two weeks before harvest.
There are usually more dollars spent on fungicides than any other input in peanuts.
In 1995, a peanut leafspot fax advisory program was started in Caddo County.
This advisory is based on a model program developed in other states and modified by Dr. John Damicone, OSU Plant Pathologist, to fit Oklahoma's growing conditions.
The report was faxed twice weekly to 18 peanut buying points, Farmer Cooperatives, or other facilities Mere peanut farmers congregate.
Receiving sites were asked to post the reports in locations likely to be seen by producers.
On the report, information was given as to the number of "infection hours" accumulated at a given location in a calendar type format.
An infection hour is one hour Mere the humidity is greater than 95% and the temperature is between 60:8 degrees fair and height and 89.6 degrees fair and height.
Information was also given as to the number of infection hours necessary before an application of fungicide was warranted.
The weather parameters needed to calculate the leafspot infection hours were obtained from the Oklahoma Mesonet system.
This is a fully automated, real-time weather monitoring system that is accessible from a computer equipped with a modem.
Three weather stations In Caddo County were used for this project.
In 1995, leafspot infection was relatively light.
On fields following a more conventional monitory system, there were approximately six applications of fungicide applied for leafspot control.
Farmers following the peanut leafspot advisory program were only instructed to make three applications of fungicide for leafspot during the growing season.
This would have resulted in a savings to producers following the program of approximately $35 per acre.
At the and of the growing season a survey instrument was used to determine the effectiveness of the fax advisory program.
Cooperators receiving the reports indicated that roughly 20% of their clientele were receiving the reports on at least a weekly basis.
There are 32,000 acres of peanuts planted annually in Caddo County.
If 20% of the acreage was managed by actively following the leafspot advisory fax program, a gross savings of as much as $230,000 was realized by Caddo County peanut producers.
This program will be continued in 1996.

OREGON
BASELINE SMALL FARM PROGRAMMING EFFORTS IN OREGON
Extension staff in moderate to heavily populated areas of Oregon have for years worked to provide programming for owners of small farms.
These efforts were generally inconsistent and outside the primary role of the agents involved.
Recent population increases in western Oregon and resulting demands on county Extension offices have moved small farm programming high on Extension's list of priorities.
Impacts/Successes Include: 1.
The development of an Extension position specializing in small farms and establishment of a small farms working group which will coordinate programming efforts on a state-wide basis.
2.
Survey results offering the first reliable data in Oregon on the needs of small farmers.
Small Farms Extension Agent and Working Group.
During the past four years, the Oregon State University Extension Service has experienced repeated budget cuts and staff reductions.
Working to reorganize itself, the Extension Service spent twelve months debating its purpose and setting priorities.
Recognizing the value of small farms to the rural landscape, an Extension position specializing in small farms was created and a working group to coordinate state-wide efforts for small farms was established.
These actions constitute a significant financial and administrative commitment during a period of down-sizing in other Extension programs.
This is an important impact.
Small Farm Survey Results.
During the spring of 1996, Oregon State University and Portland State University cooperated on a survey by mail of people who had attended workshops targeting small farm owners.
Nearly 32 percent of the 710 surveys were returned.
About 72 percent of the respondents owned 20 acres or less.
Some results conflicted with conventional wisdom.
For example: * The highest priority of the respondents was for programming in marketing and taxes (56 percent and 53 percent of respondents).
* Less than 25 percent of respondents gave programming in various types of livestock (including exotics) a high priority.
* Programming in horticultural crops (both traditional and non-traditional) was given a high priority by over 30 percent of respondents.
As Oregon's small farm Extension develops, these data will provide guidance for workshops and applied research.

SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
Sustainable agricultural concepts and practices more introduced to 394 small farm producers through 19 trained field staff supporting and working with 1890 programs.
Nine hundred and forty-two educational activities (i.e., field days, workshops, tours, special training, meetings, etc.) were conducted emphasizing sustainable agricultural concepts and approaches.
Six hundred and fifty-nine of these activities focused on sustainable agronomic and horticultural practices, and the remaining 283 on livestock enterprises including rodents and fish.
Small farm producers were advised of 24 different management crop rotation, fertilizer application, and the use of resistant varieties, mechanical cultivation, and sustainable practices applicable to livestock enterprises were the most popular subjects taught.
Biologically based pesticide formulations, alternative farm enterprises, and integrated management systems were emphasized.
Small farm producers gained and implemented knowledge on crop refuse destruction, sanitation, variation in time of planting and/or harvesting, and record keeping.
Fourteen counties plus headquarters implemented sustainable agricultural programs and conducted result and method demonstrations.
Extension field staff were introduced to and trained to use farm decision support system.
These systems have great potential in assisting small farm producers with planning and budgeting.
Data indicated that an average of five sustainable agricultural practices were adopted by enrollees.
Farm income averaged $8,225 with 52 percent of the enrollees reporting slight increase.
Internal linkages for the sustainable agriculture initiative involved specialists and field staff of the Cooperative Extension Program and the Texas Agricultural Extension Service.
The Texas Department of Agriculture served as the external linkage.
Twenty-two volunteers served as cooperators conducting sustainable agricultural result demonstrations.
Six farmers were guided by the state staff in conducting result demonstrations for six farm tours.

WASHINGTON
In 11 western Washington counties, a total of 88 Livestock Advisor volunteers were recruited, trained and certified to assist follow small-scale livestock/forage producers.
The training involved an average of 100 hours of classroom, practical field experience and a 3-day tour of the main campus of Washington State University.
Each volunteer is expected to contribute an average of 60 hours of time in teaching, in writing, and demonstrating livestock production/management techniques.
IMPACTS:
(a) The Livestock Advisors extend and enhance the effectiveness of the Cooperative Extension animal science faculty.
At $12.00/hour minimum equivalent of volunteer time, at least $5,000.00 was saved in FTE equivalent time by utilizing volunteer time and expertise..
(b) A representative example is that one sheep producer family who learned the basics of proper pasture management saved $2,000.00 in feed costs for his ewe/lamb operation... that could mean their profit margin.
This example can be easily and readily multiplied throughout western Washington.

A NOTE OF APPRECIATION
Many thanks to the State Specialists and Coordinators who submitted the success stories/impacts that made compiling this report a reality.
This report is an attempt to explore the prospects of documenting program impacts and accountability.
The success stories/impacts were collected through 1995 for the most part.
Through our efforts at the National Small Farm Conference and beyond, we hope to strategize on the types of indicators whereby impacts can be measured against in relation to Small Farm Programs in particular and Agricultural Programs in general.
