Recently, (it seems this statement will always be proper as computers keep getting faster) another Mersenne prime has been discovered.
A look-up of this will connect you to perfect numbers.
Many references exist.
Response #: 2 of 2 Author: rcwinther I heard about the new largest-known prime on the news, but I have not seen anything about it in print, so I do not know how big it is.
The previous record was the prime number 2^756839 - 1, a number of 227,832 digits.
Our printer does about 5000 characters per page, so this works out to about 45 1/2 pages.
The new record-holder is likely to be significantly bigger.
A questioner on the Computer Science BB says that the new record-holder is the number 2^859433 - 1.
This number would have 258,716 digits, requiring about 52 pages.
