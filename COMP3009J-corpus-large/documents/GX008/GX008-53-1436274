Assisted living Chapter 420-5-4
General Approach
Regulations for assisted living were effective in 1991.
A task force chaired by the state Department of Public Health was appointed in 1996 and held two meetings.
A transcript and comments from task force members were submitted for further action.
The Department is now developing significant revisions to the regulations.
The primary issues being addressed include aging-in-place, admission/retention criteria and serving people with Alzheimer's disease.
Draft revisions will be issued for comment in the Spring and final rules by the Spring of 1999.
The State Health Coordinating Committee is also reviewing assisted living.
The Committee is interested in covering assisted living under Medicaid and determining the number of nursing facility residents that could be served in an assisted living setting.
The current regulations license three categories of facilities.
Congregate assisted living facilities serve 17 or more adults, group assisted living facilities serve 4-16 adults and family assisted living facilities serve 2-3 adults.
Since 1992 the number of licensed assisted living facilities has grown from 171 to 207 in 1995 and 261 by March 1998.
The number of beds has increased from 3,710 in 1992 to 4,840 in 1995 and 6,222 in 1998.
Definition
Assisted living facility "means a permanent building, portion of a building, or group of buildings (not to include mobile homes and trailers) in which room, board, meals, laundry, and assistance with personal care and other services provided are for not less than twenty-four hours in any week to a minimum of two ambulatory adults not related by blood or marriage to the owner and/or administrator."
Unit Requirements
The regulations do not require separate living and sleeping quarters.
Private bedrooms without sitting areas must provide 80 square feet and double rooms 130 square feet.
If sitting areas are included, private rooms must be 160 square feet and double rooms 200 square feet.
Bath tubs or showers must be available for every eight beds, and lavatories and toilets for every six beds.
Lockable doors are permitted.
Tenant Policy
The regulations provide that assisted living facilities may serve "ambulatory adults who do not require acute, continuous or extensive medical or nursing care and are not in need of hospital or nursing home care."
Facilities may not serve anyone with communicable or infectious disease, chronic health conditions requiring extensive nursing care and/or daily medication supervision, persons requiring daily professional observation or the exercise of professional judgement by staff.
People who need assistance from more than one person to evacuate a building, show severe symptoms of senility, or require restraint or treatment for addiction to alcohol or drugs may not be admitted or retained.
Evacuation.
Residents must be ambulatory on admission either aided or unaided by prosthesis.
Services
Assisted living facilities must provide personal care for bathing, oral hygiene, hair care and nail care.
Facilities may provide for general observation and may arrange or assist residents to obtain medical attention or nursing services when needed.
Home health may be provided by a certified agency as long as residents do not require hospital or nursing home care.
Financing
Other than SSI, no public financing is available for assisted living.
Medication
Assistance is limited to reminders, reading container labels to the resident, checking the dosage and opening containers.
Licensed nurses are allowed to administer medications for residents who do not require acute, continuous or extensive medical or nursing care.
Staffing
The regulations require at least one staff member per six residents 24-hours a day and personal care staff to meet the needs of residents.
Training
Administrators must have 6 hours of continuing education annually on state law and rules, identifying and reporting abuse, neglect and exploitation, special needs of the elderly, mentally ill and mentally retarded, basic first aide/CPR training; business management; human resource management and plant management and safety.
Staff must receive core training that includes but is not limited to: basic first aid; CPR; bathing, grooming, handling of the elderly - 16 hours; infection control; resident's rights; and the survey process.
CNAs in good standing are exempt.
Background Check
Not specified.
Monitoring
Facilities are monitored through licensing review and periodic inspections by the Board of Health depending on funding for inspectors.
Fee
Licensure fees are $200 plus $5 per bed over 10 beds.

Assisted living homes, Alaska Statute Ã¯Â¿Â½ 47.33.005 et seq.; 7 Alaska Administrative Code Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.010 et seq.
General Approach
The state's assisted living regulations are being reviewed by the state aging office to strengthen license revocation and appeal procedures and other aspects of the program.
Proposed revisions are being developed for public comment.
No timetable has been set for issuing revised regulations.
In 1997 legislation was passed requiring a criminal background check on all staff.
Prior to 1997, criminal background checks were in regulation but not in statute.
Rules to implement the amended law are being drafted.
A new methodology for reimbursing Medicaid beneficiaries is also being developed.
The states assisted living law was passed in 1994 to encourage the development of assisted living homes to provide a homelike environment for older persons and persons with a mental or physical disability needing assistance with activities of daily living.
The law promotes resident participation in the community, recognizes the resident's right and responsibility to evaluate and make choices concerning the services to be provided.
The law provides for licensing assisted living homes for elders, people with dementia, and people with physical, mental or developmental disabilities.
The Department of Health and Social Services licenses homes for people with mental or developmental disabilities and the Department of Administration licenses homes for older people, people with dementia and people with physical disabilities.
The agencies issued joint regulations in 1995 setting additional requirements and standards.
In March 1998, 78 homes with a total of 478 beds had been licensed by the Division of Senior Services.
This total does not include the state's Pioneer Homes which are six state operated homes that also provide supportive services.
Of the licensed homes, 85% have five or fewer beds.
One home has 60 units which are individual apartments.
An estimated 50% of the units are private rooms.
The regulations set minimal requirements which are defined in more detail in policies and procedures.
Based on their initial experience, state officials are reviewing the regulations governing the overall enforcement and sanctions procedures to expedite action when warranted; to make the criminal check procedures consistent with those used by other agencies; and to clarify liability insurance requirements.
To expedite reviews and maximize staff capacity, the licensure staff conduct regular orientation sessions to explain the program and its requirements to interested providers.
The sessions are held about every six weeks and have reduced the amount of staff time spent explaining the application process to individual providers or others interested in obtaining a license.
Definition
The law creates "Chapter 33.
Assisted Living Homes" to emphasize that assisted living serves as the resident's home.
The statute applies to residential facilities serving three or more adults who are not related to the owner of the residence by blood or marriage that provide housing, food service, and provide, obtain or offer to provide assistance with activities of daily living, personal assistance (help with IADLs, obtaining supportive services [recreational, leisure, transportation, social, legal, et. al.], being aware of the resident's whereabouts when traveling in the community, and monitoring activities) or a combination of ADL assistance and personal assistance.
Unit Requirements
No requirements are specified for the type of unit.
Shared rooms are allowed.
Facilities must meet life safety code requirements applicable for buildings of its size.
Homes for six or more people must meet applicable state and municipal standards for sanitation and environmental protection.
In view of the vast expanse and geographic variation within the state, the licensing standards are based on community and neighborhood standards rather than a statewide standard.
This allows homes to be licensed that are consistent with prevailing local housing standards.
Tenant Policy
The home and each resident must sign a residential service contract that describes the services and accommodations to be provided, rates, the rights, duties and obligations of the resident, and the policies and procedures for terminating the contract.
Residents who have exceeded the 45 consecutive day limit for receiving 24-hour skilled nursing (see below) may continue to live at the home if the home and the resident or resident's representative have consulted with the resident's physician, discussed the consequences and risks and a revised plan without 24-hour nursing has been reviewed by a registered nurse.
Terminally ill residents may continue to reside in the residence if a physician certifies that the person's needs are being met.
Evacuation.
These requirements are included in life safety code standards and facility procedures for emergency evacuation drills.
Services
Each resident must have a service plan of care developed within 30 days of move-in that identifies strengths and weaknesses performing ADLs, physical disabilities and impairments, preferences for roommates, living environment, food, recreation, religious affiliation and other factors.
The plan also identifies the ADLs with which the resident needs help, how help will be provided by the home or other agencies, and health related services and how they will be addressed.
The plan must also identify the resident's reasonable wants and how those will be addressed.
If health related services are provided or arranged, the evaluation must be done quarterly.
If no health related services are provided, an annual evaluation is required.
Assisted living homes may provide intermittent nursing services to residents who do not require 24-hour care and supervision.
Intermittent nursing tasks may be delegated to unlicensed staff for tasks designated by the board of nursing.
Twenty four hour skilled care may be provided for not more than 45 consecutive days.
Financing
In a limited number of cases, room and board and some services are covered by the state's "general relief" program.
The payment amounts in the Anchorage area are $30.00 a day for Level I homes, $33.95 for Level II homes and $40.90 for Level III homes.
Services for Medicaid waiver certified individuals in assisted living homes are funded under the state's Choice Program, a Medicaid HCBS waiver.
The Senior Services Division is in process of revising the reimbursement methodology which is currently based on levels of care related to the previous licensure categories.
Rates vary by area of the state.
In the Anchorage area, Level I homes, formerly adult foster care, provide 24-hour awake staff but do not meet unscheduled needs directly and receive $40.38 a day.
Level II homes receive $50.89 a day and have staff capacity to meet unscheduled needs, particularly at night.
Level III homes receive $61.39 a day.
Homes caring for residents needing extra staff (incontinent, skin care, added supervision, help with medication) can receive a $15.76 per day add-on to the rate.
If a resident is also attending adult day care three or more days a week, the rate is reduced to between $29 and $51 a day depending upon the level of the facility.
A multiplier is applied to the rates which results in higher payments in rural and frontier areas.
The levels of reimbursement were originally based on the size and staffing level of the three licensing levels of facilities.
The rate structure will be revised to reflect residents needs and acuity rather than the size of the facility.
A preliminary methodology would develop a payments for low, intermediate and high needs for medical and acute care needs, physical care needs and cognitive needs.
See table.
About 30% of the elderly Choice participants, 175 people, reside in assisted living homes.
Case managers from local organizations contract with the Division of Senior Services to conduct assessments, determine eligibility and develop a plan of care for Choice participants who reside in assisted living homes.
Medications
"Home staff persons" may provide medication reminders, reading labels, opening containers, observing a resident while taking medication, checking self-administered dosage against the label, reassuring the resident that the dosage is correct, and directing/guiding the hand of a resident at the resident's request.
Staffing
Homes must have the type and number of staff needed to operate the home and must develop a staffing plan that is appropriate to provide services required by resident care plans.
Staff must pass a criminal background check.
Administrators must be 21 years of age or older and have sufficient experience, training or education to fulfill the responsibilities of an administrator.
Training
No additional training requirements are specified for administrators or staff.
Background Check
An administrator must provide a sworn statement as to whether the person has been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor involving drugs or physical or sexual abuse or a misdemeanor involving alcohol.
Individuals must also provide the results of a name check, criminal background check and fingerprint investigation conducted by the Alaska Department of Public Safety.
Further regulations implementing criminal background checks are being developed.
Monitoring
Both the Department of Health and Social Services and the Division of Senior Services are responsible for screening applicants, issuing licenses and investigating complaints.
The departments may delegate responsibility for investigating and making recommendations for licensing to a state, municipal or private agency.
Homes must submit an annual self-monitoring report on forms provided by the department.
Case managers monitor Choice waiver participants monthly.
Fees
Facilities receiving a voluntary license pay a fee of $25, homes serving 3-5 people pay $75 and homes serving six or more residents pay $150.

Comprehensive administrative rules and regulations Ã¯Â¿Â½R9-10-701 et seq.
General Approach
Rapid growth in the number and types of home and community based settings serving elderly and adults with physical disabilities, ranging from private homes to facilities providing specialized care to large retirement complexes, has outpaced the regulations developed to guide this development.
In the Spring of 1997, the Arizona Department of Health Services' Office of Home and Community Based Licensure established a 28 member task force to help consolidate five of the existing six licensing classifications (adult care homes, supported residential living centers, supervisory care homes, unclassified homes and adult family care) into a single assisted living category.
Rules have been issued which are expected to be effective in November, 1998.
The new assisted living facility category has requirements based on the size of the facility and supplemental requirements depending on the level of service provided.
The core requirements address facilities serving 10 or fewer residents, eleven or more residents and adult foster homes which serve 1-6 residents.
Facilities will be licensed to provide one of three levels of care supervisory care services, personal care services, and directed care services and must meet supplemental requirements.
The directed care level will serve people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia who cannot selfdirect their care, eg., cannot recognize danger, summon assistance, express need or make basic decisions.
Requirements for specialized training, activities, physical plant and services will be established.
The goal of the task force was to develop regulations that are consistent and ensure minimum standards for health, safety and welfare.
Regulations will be based on the resident's level of need and promote dignity, independence, self-determination, privacy and choice.
Legislation was approved in 1998 authorizing the new category.
AHCCCS, which administers the state's Medicaid managed care program, will retain higher standards (eg., private living units), for providers interested in serving Medicaid beneficiaries.
Pilot program expanded statewide Chapter 163 (1993) authorized a three year supportive residential living centers (SRLC) pilot project, which is the same as assisted living, to test the feasibility of developing additional cost effective alternatives to nursing homes for participants in the Arizona Long Term Care Systems (ALTCS).
The pilot was implemented in Maricopa County by the Maricopa Managed Care Systems, a county based HMO which contracts with the state Medicaid agency, AHCCCS, to operate the ALTCS system.
In 1996, the legislature approved the statewide expansion of the program and provided funding for 700 ALTCS members and no restrictions on the number of private pay residents.
After 1997, there is no limit on the number of members who can be served through Supportive Residential Living Centers (to be renamed assisted living facilities).
As required by legislation, Maricopa Managed Care Systems issued a report in December 1995.
The report recommended a statewide expansion of the program based on three primary findings: cost effectiveness, high satisfaction level among participants and the ability to meet resident needs in a less restricting environment.1 The study found annual savings of $2 million based on the continuous enrollment of 100 participants.
The evaluation collected data on resident satisfaction, number of residents, length of stay, level of care, emergency room utilization, urgent care visits, number of days of hospitalization and cost, average daily cost of supportive residential living, service levels, demographic information, functional information, and medical information.
The study identified three areas for further study: building codes, public versus private pay criteria and level of care.
The following information is based on the new proposed regulations.
Definition
Assisted living facility means a residential care institution, including adult foster care, that provides or contracts to provide supervisory care services, personal care services or directed care services on a continuing basis.
Supervisory care services mean general supervision, including daily awareness or resident functioning and continuing needs, the ability to intervene in a crisis and assistance in the selfadministration of prescribed medications.
Personal care services mean assistance with activities of daily living that can be performed by persons without professional skills or professional training and include the coordination or provision of intermittent nursing services and the administration of medication and treatments by a nurse who is licensed pursuant to Title 32, Chapter 15 or as otherwise provided by law.
Directed care services means programs and services, including personal care services, provided to persons who are incapable of recognizing danger, summoning assistance, expressing need or making basic care decisions.
The ALTCS program will contract with assisted living homes (10 or less) and assisted living centers but only centers that offer residential units (apartments).
Unit Requirements
Assisted living centers (11+ residents) may provide residential units or bedrooms.
Residential units must have at least 220 square feet of floor space, excluding bathroom and closet for one person with an additional 100 square feet for a second person.
Units must have a keyed entry, bathroom, resident controlled thermostat and a kitchen area with sink, refrigerator, cooking appliance that may be removed or disconnected and space for food preparation.
Assisted living centers and homes providing bedrooms must have 80 square feet in single rooms and 60 square feet per resident in double rooms.
No more than two residents may share a room.
Rooms occupied by residents receiving personal care services or directed care services must have a bell, intercom or other mechanical means to contact staff.
At least one toilet, sink and shower is required for every eight residents
Tenant Policy
ALFs providing supervisory care services may serve residents who need health or health related services if these services are provided by a licensed home health or hospice agency.
ALFs with a personal care service license may not accept or retain any resident who is unable to direct self-care; requires continuous nursing services unless the nursing services are provided by a licensed hospice agency or a private duty nurse; residents with a stage III or IV pressure sore or someone who is bed bound due to a short illness unless the primary care physician approves, the resident signs a statement and the resident is under the care of a nurse, a licensed home health agency, or a licensed hospice agency.
ALFs licensed to provide direct care services may admit residents who are bedbound, need continuous nursing services or have a stage III or IV pressure sore if the requirements for facilities providing personal care services are met.
Services
Residents must receive an assessment and a service plan within 14 days of acceptance.
Plans must be reviewed every 12 months for residents receiving supervisory care services, every six months for residents receiving personal care services and every three months for residents receiving directed care services.
Services must meet scheduled and unscheduled needs.
Facilities must provide general supervision; promote resident independence, autonomy, dignity, choice, self-determination and the resident's highest physical, cognitive and functional capacity; help utilizing community resources; encouragement to preserve outside supports; individual attention and social interaction and activities.
Facilities providing personal care services also provide skin maintenance, sufficient fluids to maintain hydration, incontinence care, an assessment by a primary care provider for residents needing medication administration or nursing services.
Facilities providing directed care must provide cognitive stimulation and activities to maximize functioning; encouragement to eat meals and snacks; and an assessment by a primary care provider.
ALTCS Services are grouped into three types: hotel services, personal care services and nursing care services.
Hotel services include meals, linen and personal laundry, housekeeping and social and recreational services.
Personal care includes assistance with ADLs, managing functional and behavior problems, assisting with medication and oversight.
Nursing services cover observation and assessment, routine nursing tasks, intermittent nursing care and terminal care delivered by hospice providers.
Prior to move in, an interdisciplinary team (manager, staff, RN if nursing services are provided, resident and/or representative and case manager if applicable) conducts an assessment.
A plan of care is developed with the resident or their representative that identifies the services needed, the person responsible for providing the service, method and frequency of services, measurable resident goals and the person responsible for assisting the resident in an emergency.
Financing
Assisted living facilities can contract with ALTCS program contractors to serve beneficiaries meeting the nursing home criteria.
Program administrators used rates set for adult foster care, nursing facilities, the Oregon assisted living program and the Arizona HCBS program as guidelines in setting the rates paid to what were formerly called Supportive Residential Living Centers.
(ALTCS will use the new terms contained in the assisted living regulations.)
Administrators also consider the package of services provided and ask each Center to submit a budget.
Three classes of rates are negotiated based on the level of care: low, intermediate and high skilled.
The rates include room and board which is paid by the resident.
The monthly room and board amount is the resident's "alternative share of cost" (spend down) or 85% of the current SSI payment, whichever is greater.
For residents who receive SSI, the payment rate is $470 a month of which $403.10 is paid to the residence to cover room and board charges and $66.90 is retained by the resident.
ARIZONA RATES BY PROGRAM CONTRACTOR - Class I Class II Class III APIPA $46.67 $56.67 $66.67 Ventana $50.00 $56.67 - MMCS $47.33 $60.42 $73.88 Pima $46.45 $59.30 $72.51
An evaluation of the SLRC program found that the average cost of SRL was 58.7% of the cost of a nursing facility in FY 95 - $1567 a month compared to $2669 for nursing facility residents, for a savings of $1102 a month.
Ancillary health costs (inpatient, physician, transportation, emergency rooms etc.) were 30% lower for SRL participants than nursing home residents.
Medications
Facilities must have policies and procedures governing the procurement, administration, storing and disposal of medications.
Staff may supervise self-administration by opening bottle caps, reading labels, checking the dosage and observing the resident taking the medication.
Medications which cannot be self-administered must be administered by an RN or "as otherwise permitted."
The phrase as otherwise permitted was included to accommodate any future statutory changes in the state's nurse practice act.
Medication organizers can be prepared a month in advance by an RN or family member.
Staffing
Facilities are required to ensure that sufficient staff are available to provide services consistent with the level of care for which the facility is licensed, services established in a care plan, service to meet resident needs for scheduled and unscheduled needs, general supervision and intervention in a crisis 24-hours a day, food services, environmental services, safe evacuations and ongoing social and recreational services.
Training
Managers must be 21, certified and have a minimum of 12 months of health related experience.
Staff must complete an orientation that includes the characteristics and needs of residents; the facility's philosophy and goals; promotion of resident dignity, independence, self-determination, privacy, choice and resident rights; the significance and location of service plans and how to read and implement a service plan; facility rules, policies and procedures; confidentiality of resident records; infection control; food preparation, service and storage if applicable; abuse, neglect and exploitation; accident, incident and injury reporting; and fire, safety and emergency procedures.
Managers and staff must complete 12 hours of ongoing training annually covering promoting resident dignity, independence, self-determination, privacy, choice, and resident rights/fire, safety and emergency procedures; infection control; abuse, neglect and exploitation.
Staff in facilities licensed to provide directed care services must receive a minimum of four hours of training in providing services to residents.
In addition to the above topics, training may include providing services to residents; nutrition, hydration and sanitation; behavioral health or gerontology; social, recreational or rehabilitative services; personnel management, if applicable; common medical conditions, medication procedures, medical terminology and personal hygiene; service plan development, implementation or review and other needs identified by the facility.
Staff must also maintain current CPR certification and complete six hours of continuing education annually pursuant to Ã¯Â¿Â½36-448.11(D).
Nurses aides in good standing are deemed to meet the initial training requirements.
Certificate of training Staff must obtain a certificate of training.
Facilities may develop their own training and certificate program with approval from the department.
Department approved training programs have requirements for instructors and the method of instruction.
The competency based approach sets standards for supervisory care services, personal care services, directed care services, and manager training.
Supervisory care services: 20 hours or the amount of time needed to verify a person demonstrates skills and knowledge in assisted living principles; communication; managing personal stress; preventing abuse, neglect and exploitation; controlling the spread of disease and infection; documentation and record keeping; implementing service plans; nutrition, hydration and food services; assisting with self-administration of medications; providing social, recreational and rehabilitative activities; and fire, safety and emergency procedures.
Personal care services: 30 hours (50 total) or the amount of time needed to verify a person demonstrates skills and knowledge in additional skills areas such as the aging process, common medical conditions associated with aging or physical disabilities and medications; assisting with ADLs and taking vital signs.
Directed care services: 12 hours (75 total) or the amount of time needed to verify a person demonstrates skills and knowledge of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; communicating with residents with residents w ho are unable to direct care; providing services including problem solving, maximizing functioning and life skills training for those unable to direct care; managing difficult behaviors; and developing and providing social, recreational and rehabilitative activities for such persons.
Background Check
Staff must comply with fingerprint requirements under A.R.S. 36-411.
Legislation requiring federal criminal background checks is likely to be passed and implemented in 1998.
Monitoring
The licensing agency conducts annual renewal inspections.
Licenses may be renewed for two years for facilities that are free of deficiencies.
Facilities are monitored by ALTCS program contractors and the Arizona Department of Health Services.
Sites are recertified annually by the Department of Health Services.
During the pilot phase, MMCS monitored resident care on a quarterly basis, provided technical assistance and conducted meetings of providers to obtain feedback on the program.
With statewide expansion, participants are visited at least quarterly by their ALTCS case manager.
Annual operating and financial reviews of ALTCS contractors (HMOs) are conducted annually by AHCCCS.
The reviews also include case management and provider records and claims data.
AHCCCS also reviews a random sample of residents, including assisted living residents, to evaluate the appropriateness and quality of care.
The review found no unmet needs or quality of care problems.

Financing
Personal care services are reimbursed as a state plan service under Medicaid based on a plan of care.
Facilities are reimbursed fee for service.
A maximum of 64 hours of care per month may be covered without prior authorization.
About 1,000 residents are covered each month.
Medication
RCFs may remind residents to take medications, read label instructions and remove the cap or packaging.
Staffing
The number of direct care staff needed is scaled for daytime, evening and night shifts based on the number of residents.
Staffing must be sufficient to meet the needs of residents.
Training
Administrators must have a current certification as a residential care facility administrator, or complete a course of instruction and training prescribed by the Department.
Staff An orientation covering, at a minimum, job duties, resident rights, abuse/neglect reporting requirements and fire and tornado drills is required.

Residential care facilities for the elderly Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 8.
General Approach
California licenses 5,900 residential care facilities for the elderly with 123,238 residents.
About 70% of the facilities serve fewer than six residents.
These facilities account for between 25-30% of all residents.
As in other states, nursing facilities are concentrating on providing specialty, subacute and rehabilitative care, many through contracts with HMOs.
Nursing homes have not expressed interest in converting to assisted living facilities, however, many nursing homes are adding assisted living to free beds for higher need residents and to provide referrals as assisted living residents age.
At the direction of the state legislature, a study of state approaches to assisted living was conducted by the Department of Health and filed in 1997.
Informal discussions among state agencies, assisted living providers and legislative staff were to discuss the definition of assisted living and where it fits or how it compares to the current residential care facilities for elderly model.
The discussion has focused on if assisted living is different, what services should be allowed and whether assisted living should be considered a bundle of services that is provided without regard to the building.
Other issues addressed included the definition, information needed by consumers, the scope of services to be covered and the needs of clients that can be met, the place of assisted living in the continuum of care and whether a new licensure category was needed or appropriate.
The 18 member group has discussed financing for low income elders but believes Medicaid waiver financing would lead to a medical model.
The Department of Health has concerns about residents meeting the nursing home level of care criteria being served in settings that are not licensed.
The aging community believes there are too many licensure categories already and new ones only serve providers seeking higher levels of reimbursement without really increasing the services provided.
During 1995, legislation (Chapter 550 of the Acts of 1995) was passed that allows RCFEs that serve people with Alzheimer's Disease to develop secure perimeters.
Based on the results of a pilot project, the law allows facilities that meet specific additional requirements to secure exterior doors or perimeter fences, or to install delayed egress devices on exterior doors and perimeter fence gates.
Resident supervision devices, wrist bracelets which activate a visual or auditory alarm when a resident leaves the facility may also be used.
Facilities must provide interior and exterior space for residents to wander freely, receive approval from the local fire marshal and conduct quarterly fire drills.
Facilities with delayed egress devices must be sprinklered and contain smoke detectors and the devices must deactivate when the sprinkler system or smoke detectors activate.
The devices must also be able to be deactivated from a central location and deactivate when a force of 15 pounds is applied for more than two seconds to the panic bar.
In addition facilities shall permit residents to leave who continue to indicate such a desire and staff must ensure continued safety.
Reports must be submitted when residents wander away from the facility without staff.
Delayed egress devices may not substitute for staff.
A voluntary disclosure process has been adopted under which facilities offering special services for people with Alzheimer's Disease disclose information concerning their program.
A consumer's guide has been developed which alerts family members to several key questions that should be asked.
The areas include the philosophy of the program and how it meets the needs of people with Alzheimer's, the pre-admission assessment process used by the facility, the transition to admission, the care and activities that will be provided, staffing patterns and the special training received by staff, the physical environment and indicators of success used by the facility.
Definition
Residential care facility for the elderly means a housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the resident, or the resident's guardian, conservator or other responsible person, where 75% of the residents are 60 years of age or older, or, if younger, have needs compatible with other residents and where varying levels of care and supervision are provided, as agreed to at time of admission or as determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal.
Unit Requirements
Occupancy is limited to two residents per bedroom which must be large enough to accommodate easy passage between beds, required furniture and assistant devices such as wheelchairs or walkers.
One toilet and sink is required for every six residents and a bath tub or shower for every 10 residents.
Tenant Policy
Facilities may admit or retain residents who are capable of administering their own medications; receive medical care and treatment outside the facility or from a visiting nurse; residents who need to be reminded to take medications; and people with mild dementia, or mild temporary emotional disturbance resulting from personal loss or change in living arrangement.
Facilities may not admit or retain anyone with a communicable disease; anyone who requires 24-hour skilled nursing or intermediate care or is bedridden more than for more than 14 days including residents who are unable to transfer independently to and from bed and are unable to leave the building unassisted in an emergency.
The regulations allows residents with health conditions requiring incidental medical services which are specified in the rules to be admitted and retained (eg., intermittent positive pressure breathing, indwelling catheter, management of incontinence, colostomy/ileostomoy, contractures, healing wounds).
Residents who will be bedridden more than 14 days may be retained if the facility submits a physician's statement to the Department of Health stating that the condition is temporary and an estimated date upon which the resident will no longer be confined to bed is provided.
Alzheimer's projects Facilities may admit and retain people with Alzheimer's Disease who are not able to respond to verbal instructions to leave a building without assistance provided they have: * Submitted a waiver exception request that includes a plan of operation which specifically addresses the needs of Alzheimer's residents; * A training plan which ensures that facility staff can meet the needs of residents; * An activity program and resident assessment and re-assessment procedures; * Procedures to notify physicians when behavior changes; * A written plan to minimize the use of psycho-tropic medications; and * A disaster and mass casualty plan.
Services
Services are divided into basic services and care and supervision.
Basic services include safe and healthful living accommodations; personal assistance and care; observation and supervision; planned activities; food service; and arrangements for obtaining incidental medical and dental care.
Care and supervision covers assistance with ADLs and assumption of varying degrees of responsibility for the safety and well being of residents.
The tasks include assistance with dressing, grooming, bathing and other personal hygiene; taking medications; and central storing and distribution of medications.
Medications
Facilities may assist with self-administration of medications and, if staff is authorized by law, administer injections.
Staffing
Sufficient staff must be employed to deliver services required by residents.
On the job training or experience is required in the principles of nutrition, food storage and preparation, housekeeping and sanitation standards, skill and knowledge to provide necessary care and supervision, assistance with medications, knowledge to recognize early signs of illness and knowledge of community resources.
Requirements for awake staff vary by the size of the facility.
For 16 or less, staff must be available in the facility; 16-100, at least one awake staff; 101-200, 1 on call and 1 awake with an additional awake staff for each additional 100 residents.
Training
Administrators Individuals shall complete an approved certification program prior to be being employed as an administrator.
The program must include 40 hours of classroom training which covers laws, rights, regulations and policies (12); business operations (3); management and supervision (3); psycho-social needs of the elderly (5); physical needs of the elderly (5); community and support services (2); use, misuse and interaction of drugs (5); and admission, retention and assessment procedures (5).

Staff Personnel must be given on the job training or have related experience in: the principles of good nutrition, good food preparation and storage and menu planning; housekeeping and sanitation procedures; skill and knowledge required to provide necessary resident care and supervision including the ability to communicate with residents; knowledge required to safely assist with prescribed medications which are self-administered; knowledge necessary in order to recognize early signs of illness and the need for professional help; and knowledge of community services and resources.
Facilities licensed for 16 or more must have a planned on the job training program in the above areas including orientation, skill training and continuing education.
Background Check
The licensing agency conducts a criminal background check of officers of the organization, adults responsible for administration and direct supervision, persons providing direct care and employees having frequent contact with residents and others and may approve or deny a license or employment based on its findings.
A fingerprint clearance shall be received by the licensing agency on all persons subject to criminal record review prior to issuing a license.
Monitoring
Facilities must be inspected annually.
Three levels of penalties are allowed for violations with an (A) immediate, (B) potential and (C) technical impact.
$50 per day civil penalties are allowed for A and B violations increasing to $100 per day if the same violation is repeated 3 times in a 12 month period.
Consultation is provided for Type C violations.
Fees
Licensing fees required at initial licensure and annually thereafter, are adjusted by facility size: 16 - $300; 7-15 - $450; 16-49 - $600 and 50+ - $750.
COLORADO
Citation
Personal Care Boarding Homes Chapter VII, Ã¯Â¿Â½1.1 et seq.
General Approach
Colorado licenses assisted living under personal care boarding home rules.
Rules were revised in 1993.
The number of licensed facilities has risen from 238 in 1990 to 385 in 1995 and 469 in 1998.
Nursing home beds occupied by Medicaid recipients have remained stable over the past 10 years at 10,400.
State respondents attributed the stable census to the expansion of home and community based programs, including reimbursement of personal care boarding homes.
In 1995, the legislature revised the Medicaid rate for alternative care facilities (personal care boarding homes) and participation rose from 70 facilities to 179 by March 1998.
The number of HCBS waiver participants in ACFs rose from 600 to 960 by June 1996 and 1,400 by March 1998.
While the regulations allow double occupancy and shared bathrooms, the majority of new construction provide private rooms or apartments, including homes that contract with the state to serve Medicaid recipients.
The supply of personal care boarding homes is expected to increase.
The licensing agency notes that many nursing facility owners are developing their own personal care boarding homes and few nursing home operators have complained about the level of care offered.
Definition
Personal care boarding home is "a residential facility that makes available to three or more adults not related to the owner of such facility, either directly or indirectly through a provider agreement, room and board and personal services, protective oversight, and social care due to impaired capacity to live independently, but not to the extent that regular 24-hourmedical or nursing care is required."
Units
The rules allow no more than two people to share a room for facilities built after July 1, 1986.
Single occupancy rooms must have at least 100 square feet and double occupancy rooms at least 60 square feet per person.
Cooking is not allowed in bedrooms and facilities must provide access to a food preparation area for heating or reheating food or making hot beverages subject to "house rules."
Cooking may be allowed in facilities which provide apartments rather than bedrooms.
Facilities must provide at least one bathroom for every six residents.
Tenant Policy
Personal care boarding homes may not admit or retain residents who are: * Consistently, uncontrollably incontinent of bladder unless the resident or staff is able to prevent it from becoming a health hazard; * Incontinent of bowel unless they are capable of self-care; * Totally bedfast; * Require 24-hour nursing or medical service; * Need restraints; or * Have a communicable disease.
Each facility develops their own admission criteria based on the capacity of the facility.
A review of Medicaid pre-admission screening assessment forms showed that Medicaid waiver participants in ACFs had fewer skilled needs than nursing home residents.
Services
Facilities must provide a physically safe and sanitary environment, room and board, personal services (transportation, assistance with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, individualized social supervision), protective oversight and social care.
Written "board and care plans," which must be reviewed at least annually, are required for each resident and include a list of current prescribed medications (dosage, time and route of administration, whether self-administered or assisted), dietary restrictions, allergies and any physical or mental limitations or activity restrictions.
Nursing and therapies may be received if provided by a home health agency.
Reimbursement
Medicaid rules limit room and board charges for Medicaid recipients to $448 a month.
Effective July 1998, the Medicaid rate for services is $29.88 a day.
The rate covers oversight, personal care, homemaker, chore and laundry services.
The state is interested in developing tiered rates.
MONTHLY RATES Room and board $488.00 Service $864.40 Total $1344.60
Medications
Most larger facilities have hired LPNs to administer or manage medications and ensure that physician's order have been received and recorded.
Unlicensed staff may assist with selfadministration but they cannot take physicians' orders over the phone.
Staffing
Facilities must employ sufficient staff to ensure provision of services necessary to meet resident needs.
Training
Administrators must meet the minimum education, training and experience requirements by successfully completing a program approved by the department.
Acceptable programs may be conducted by an accredited college, university or vocational school, or a program, seminar or inservice training program sponsored by an organization, association, corporation, group or agency with specific expertise in that area.
The curriculum includes at least 30 actual clock hours of which at least 15 are comprised of a discussion of each of the following topics: resident rights; environment and fire safety, including emergency procedures and first aid; assessment skills; identifying and dealing with difficult behaviors, and nutrition.
The remaining 15 hours shall provide emphasis on meeting the personal, social and emotional care needs of the resident population served.
Staff All staff, including volunteers, must be given on the job training or have related experience in the job assigned to them and shall be supervised until they have completed on the job training appropriate to their duties and responsibilities or had previous related experience evaluated.
Training and orientation in emergency procedures shall be provided to each new staff member, including volunteers, within three days of employment.
Staff members not serving as an operator who have direct responsibility for the provision of personal care, i.e. hygiene, of residents or for the supervision or training of residents in the resident's own personal care, shall provide documentation of either successful completion of course work in the provision of personal care or previous and related job experience in providing personal care to residents.
The facility shall provide adequate training and supervision for staff comprised of a discussion of each of the following topics: resident rights, environment and fire safety, including emergency procedures and first aid; assessment skills; and identifying and dealing with difficult situations and behaviors.
Background Check
The owner or licensee may have access to and shall obtain any criminal history record information from a criminal agency for all persons responsible for the care and welfare of residents.
Monitoring
The regulations require that facilities provide access to the ombudsman program to the facility and residents at reasonable times.
CONNECTICUT

Assisted living services agency.
Connecticut General Statutes Ã¯Â¿Â½19a-490; Connecticut Agency Regulations Ã¯Â¿Â½19-13-D105.
General Approach
Assisted living regulations were issued by the Health Department and approved by the Legislative Review Committee in December, 1994.
The regulations take a unique approach by allowing "managed residential communities" (MRCs) to offer assisted living services through assisted living services agencies (ALSAs).
MRCs may obtain a license to also serve as an ALSA.
Twenty two assisted living service agencies have been licensed.
About 115 homes for the aged have been licensed.
The supply, which declined for several years, seems to be increasing as more multi-facility, for-profit companies enter the market and small owner operated homes decline.
The ALSA regulations focus on the licensing of agencies to provide services rather than the building and services as an entity.
MRCs have to notify the health department of their intention to provide assisted living services.
The ALSA, either the MRC or another agency, must be licensed by the Department of Public Health and Addiction Services to provide services.
The MRC is not licensed by the Department of Public Health and Addiction Services.
MRCs must show evidence of compliance with local zoning ordinances and building codes.
A bill authorizing a pilot project in three cities with up to 300 units was signed that provides Medicaid reimbursement for assisted living services in elderly housing complexes.
The pilot will be developed by the Department of Social Services and the Connecticut Housing Finance Agency.
Another bill passed that repeals the certificate of need requirement.
Definition
Assisted living services: nursing services and assistance with ADLs provided to clients living within a managed group living environment having supportive services that encourage clients primarily age 55 or older to maintain a maximum level of independence.
Routine household services may be provided as assisted living services or by the managed residential community.
These services provide an alternative for elderly persons who require some help or aid with ADLs and/or nursing services.
Unit Requirements
To qualify as a managed residential community and a setting in which assisted living services may be provided, units are defined as a living environment belonging to a tenant(s) that includes a full bathroom within the unit including water closet, lavatory, tub or shower bathing unit and access to facilities and equipment for the preparation and storage of food.
Tenant Policy
Each ALSA agency will develop its own admission criteria but the regulations do not allow the ALSAs to impose unreasonable restrictions and screen out people whose needs may be met by the ALSA.
Assisted living services may be provided to residents with chronic and stable health, mental health and cognitive conditions as determined by a physician or health care practitioner.
Services
Services may only be provided by organizations licensed as an assisted living services agency.
Nursing services delivered under the regulations and include client teaching, wellness counseling, health promotion and disease prevention, medication administration and delegation of supervision of self-administered medications and provision of care and services to clients whose conditions are chronic and stable.
Registered nurses may also perform quarterly assessments, coordination, orientation, training and supervision of aides.
Financing
The Health and Education Facilities Authority provides loans for the development of assisted living settings.
As yet, no specific program has been developed to subsidize services for low income residents but a bill authorizing a Medicaid demonstration was passed and awaiting action by the Governor.
Medications
The regulations allow for administration of medications by licensed staff.
Assisted living aides may supervise the self-administration of medications which includes reminding, verifying, and opening the package.
Staffing
ALSAs must have at least one RN and an on-site supervisor 20 hours a week for every 10 or fewer RNs and aides and a full time supervisor for every 20 RNs and aides.
A sufficient number of aides must be available to meet residents' needs.
All aides must be certified Nurses Aides or Home Health Aides and complete 10 hours of orientation and one hour of in-service training every two months.
Twenty-four hour awake staff are not required since the needs will vary among managed residential communities.
However, 24-hour staffing could be required if indicated by resident plans of care.
An RN must be available on-call 24-hours a day.
Training
Each agency must have an orientation policy and procedure for all employees which shall include but not necessarily be limited to the following: * Organizational structure of the agency and philosophy of assisted living services; * Agency client services policies and procedures; * Agency personnel policies; and * Applicable regulations governing the delivery of assisted living services.
Each agency shall have an in-service education policy that provides an annual average of at least one hour bimonthly for each assisted living aide.
The in-service training shall include but not be limited to current information regarding specific service procedures and techniques and information related to the population being served.
Monitoring
ALSAs are required to establish a quality assurance committee that consists of a physician, a registered nurse and social worker.
The committee meets every four months and reviews the ALSA's policies on program evaluations, assessment and referral criteria, service records, evaluation of client satisfaction, standards of care and professional issues relating to the delivery of services.
Program evaluations are also to be conducted by the quality assurance committee.
The evaluation examines the extent to which the managed residential community's policies and resources are adequate to meet the needs of residents.
The committee is also responsible for reviewing a sample of resident records to determine whether agency policies were followed, whether services are provided only to residents whose level of care needs can be meet by the ALSA, and whether care is coordinated and appropriate referrals are made when needed.
The committee submits an annual report to the ALSA summarizing findings and recommendations.
The report and actions taken to implement recommendations are made available to the state Department of Public Health.
Agencies are inspected biennially.
Penalties include revocation, suspension or censure; letter of reprimand; probation; restrict acquisition of other entities; consent order compelling compliance; and civil monetary penalties.
Fees
Fees are not required for ALSAs.
Board and Care
Homes for the aged provide personal care and a maximum of two people to a room.
One toilet is required for every six residents per floor and bathing facilities are required for every eight residents.
Residents may receive temporary nursing services from a community agency.

Rest residential homes Delaware code, Part II Ã¯Â¿Â½59.0 et seq.
General Approach
Regulations governing assisted living were adopted in 1998.
The philosophy of the regulations is stated in the opening "purpose" section and directs that the "services are provided based on the social philosophy of care and must include oversight, good, shelter and the provision or coordination of a range of services that promote quality of life of the individual.
The social philosophy of care promotes the consumer's independence, privacy, dignity and is provided in a home-like environment."
Definition
Assisted living is a residential arrangement for fee for dependent elderly and adults with disabilities which provides assistance with activities of daily living and other services that promote the consumer's quality of life.
Rest residential home is an institution that provides resident beds and personal care services for persons who are normally able to manage activities of daily living.
The home should provide friendly understanding to persons living there as well as appropriate care in order that the resident's self-esteem, self-image and role as a contributing member of the community may be reinforced.
Tenant Policy
Assisted living The rules do not allow agencies to provide services to people who have conditions that exceed the agency's capabilities or who present a danger to self or others or engage in illegal drug use.
Two other groups of consumers cannot be served--unless the attending physician certifies that despite the presence of the following factors, the consumer's needs may be safely met by a service agreement developed by the agency, the attending physician, a registered nurse, the consumer or his/her representative if the consumer is incapable of making decisions and other appropriate health care professionals: * Consumers whose medical conditions are unstable to the point that they require frequent observation, assessment and intervention by a licensed professional nurse, including unscheduled nursing services, and * Consumers who are bedridden for 14 consecutive days.
Facilities may not serve residents who need transfer assistance from more than one person and a mechanical device, unless special staffing arrangements have been made, or residents who present a danger to self or others or engage in illegal drug use.
Rest residential homes No specific requirements are stated other than in the definition of a resident.
Living Unit
Assisted living The rules require individual living units.
Consumers must have access to a readily available central kitchen if one is not provided in the unit.
Bathing facilities must be provided in the unit or in a readily accessible area.
Sharing of a bedroom is limited to two consumers and only with their consent.
Rest residential homes provide 100 square feet for single occupancy and 80 square feet per resident for multiple occupancy.
No more than four people may share a room.
One bath tub or shower and one toilet and wash basin are required for every four residents.
Services
Assisted living Services are based on an assessment of the consumer completed 30 prior to admission and reviewed and revised within 14 days of admission, if appropriate, and a medical evaluation completed within 30 days prior to admission.
A service agreement describes the scope, frequency and duration of services and monitoring.
A managed risk process may be part of the service agreement.
The agreement must address the need for personal services; nursing services; food services; environmental services including housekeeping, trash removal, laundry and safety; social/emotional services; financial management; transportation; individual living unit furnishings; assistive technology and durable medical equipment; rehabilitation services; qualified interpreters; and reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.
The agreement includes shared responsibility and bounded choice except for people who are bedridden or have unstable medical conditions.
Provisions for Cognitively Impaired Residents
The regulation require that each agency shall develop policies to prevent cognitively impaired residents from wandering away from safe areas and the safe storage of medications.
Rest residential homes provide shelter, housekeeping, board, personal surveillance or direction in activities of daily living.
Reimbursement
Beneficiaries with income below 250% of the SSI level will be eligible for waiver services.
The room and board payment from the beneficiary will be $548 and three levels of reimbursement for services are planned.
The payment levels were devised based on an analysis of spending for HCBS waiver clients living in their own homes and participants in the adult foster care program.
REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS - Level I Level II Level III Room and board $538 $538 $538 Services $770 $970 $1190 Total $1308 $1508 $1728
Training
Assisted living The assisted living agency shall provide appropriate training to staff to meet the needs of the consumers.
The content and attendance of staff training programs shall be documented.
Rest residential homes Nurse aide/nurse assistant staff must complete a training course approved by the State Board and Nursing and the Board of Health.
Aides/assistants must be certified prior to employment.
Section 609 describes the curriculum and the competencies that must be measured in the following areas: nurse aide role and function; environmental needs; psycho- social needs; and physical needs.
Section 59.610 describes the qualifications of instructors and the training instructors must receive.

FLORIDA
Citation
Assisted living facilities.
Florida Statute chapter 400 Part 3; Florida Administrative Code Chapter 58A-5 et seq.
General Approach
Chapter 97-82, passed in 1997, revised training requirements and added new provisions for facilities serving people with Alzheimer's disease.
An earlier law requires that such facilities disclose in its advertising or other documents how its services are especially applicable to people with Alzheimer's disease.
Facilities serving more than 17 persons must have awake staff 24 hours a day, or if serving under 17 residents, either awake staff or mechanisms to monitor and ensure the safety of residents.
These facilities must also offer special activities, maintain a physical environment that provides for the safety and welfare of residents and employ staff who have completed appropriate training.
The law also removes a barrier to admitting residents who need a higher level of care.
Florida's original legislation (1975) was amended in 1987, 1989, 1992, 1995 and 1997.
The 1997 legislation transferred rule authority for assisted living from the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to the Department of Elderly Affairs, renamed adult congregate living facilities to assisted living facilities.
Extended congregate care (ECC) was created as a higher level of assisted living and new requirements were added for providing mental health services and staff training.
The law and rules apply a different philosophy and training for ECC facilities than standard ALFs.
Licensing authorization for ALFs remained with the Agency for Health Care Administration.
In November, 1995 there were approximately 5400 units of assisted living in 1900 facilities.
About 120 of the 1900 facilities also hold a license to provide ECC services.
In March 1998, 2,056 facilities with a total of 66,293 beds were licensed.
This includes 235 ECC beds, 110 limited nursing services beds and 152 limited mental health beds.
Definition
"Assisted living facility means any building or buildings, section of a building or distinct part of a building, residence, private home, boarding home, home for the aged or other place, whether operated for profit or not, which undertakes to provide through its ownership or management, for a period exceeding 24 hours, housing, food service, and one or more personal services for four or more adults, not related to the owner or administrator by blood or marriage, who require such services; or to provide extended congregate care, limited nursing services, or limited mental health services, when specifically licensed to do so pursuant to s. 400.407, unless the facility is licensed as an adult family care home."
"Extended congregate care means acts beyond those authorized in subsection 16 that may be performed pursuant to chapter 464 by persons licensed thereunder while carrying out their professional duties; and other supportive services which may be specified by rule.
The purpose of such services are to enable residents to age in place in a residential environment despite mental or physical limitations that might otherwise disqualify them from residency in a facility licensed under this part."
This definition creates a higher level of care in assisted living which requires an additional license.
Facilities with a limited nursing services license can provide nursing assessments, assessment of the physical and mental status of residents, administration of medications, supervision of selfadministration, applying heat, routine changes of colostomy bags, passive range of motion exercises, ice caps, urine tests and routine dressing that no require packing or irrigation, replacement of self-maintained indwelling catheters, enemas and digital stool removal therapies, and care of casts, braces or splints.
Facilities with an ECC license must develop policies which allow residents to age in place and which maximize the independence, dignity, choice and decision making; specify the personal and supportive services that will be provided; specify the nursing services to be provided and describe the procedures to ensure that unscheduled service needs are met.
Unit Requirements
Facilities licensed to provide extended congregate care must provide private rooms or apartments, or semi-private room or apartment shared with a roommate of choice, with a lockable entry door.
Facilities that offer rooms rather than apartments must have bathrooms shared by no more than three residents.
Facilities that do not have the ECC license may offer shared rooms, maximum four per room, a bathroom for every six residents and bathing facilities for every eight residents.
Tenant Policy
Admission The regulations for "admissions" to all assisted living facilities are very detailed.
New residents must: * Be able to perform ADLs with supervision or assistance (but not total assistance); * Be free of signs and symptoms of communicable diseases; * Not require 24-hour nursing supervision; * Be capable of taking their own medication or the facility has licensed staff to administer medications or the resident contracts with an outside agency for administration; * Not have bed sores or stage 2, 3, or 4 pressure ulcers; * Be able to participate in social activities; * Be capable of self-preservation with assistance; * Not be bedridden; * Non-violent; and * Cannot require 24-hour mental health care.
Continued residency Additional criteria affect continued residency.
In regular assisted living facilities, people who are bedridden more than seven days or develop a need for 24-hour nursing supervision may not be retained.
In ECC facilities, residents may not be retained if they are bedridden for more than 14 days.
Residents may stay if they develop stage 2 pressure sores but must be relocated for stage 3 and 4 pressure sores.
Residents who are medically unstable, become a danger to self or others or experience cognitive decline to prevent simple decision making may not be retained.
People who became totally dependent in 4 or more ADLs (exceptions for quadraplegics, paraplegics and victims of muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and other neuro-muscular diseases if the resident is able to communicate their needs and does not require assistance with complex medical problems) may not be retained.
Residents with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or advanced dementia may be retained if they have no significant health problems requiring nursing services.
Terminally ill residents may continue in any assisted living facility if a licensed hospice agency coordinates services, an interdisciplinary care plan is developed and all parties agree to the continued residency.
To receive services under the Medicaid waiver, tenants must be 60 years of age or older and meet one of the following criteria: * Require assistance with four or more ADLs or three ADLs plus supervision or administration of medications; * Require total help with one or more ADLs; * Have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or another type of dementia and require assistance with two or more ADLs; * Have a diagnosed degenerative or chronic medical condition requiring nursing services that cannot be provided in a standard ACLF; * Are Medicaid eligible, awaiting discharge from a nursing home but cannot return to a private residence because of a need for supervision, personal care, periodic nursing services or a combination of the three.
Services
Three levels of licensure are available: standard, limited nursing service and extended congregate care.
The first level allows facilities to provide personal care and administration of medications.
Facilities with an ECC license may provide a higher level of service including total care with up to three ADLs and any nursing service allowed under the scope of the nurse's license except those that are prohibited in the rule.
ECC facilities must describe the personal, supportive and nursing services to be made available.
Facilities may provide limited nursing services (eg., medication administration and supervision of self-administration, applying heat, passive range of motion exercises, ice packs, urine tests, routine dressings that do not require packing or irrigation and others), intermittent nursing services (eg., routine change of colostomy bag and related care, catheter care, administration of oxygen, routine care of an amputation or fracture, prophylactic and palliative skin care).

(Draft) Hawaii Administrative Rules Ã¯Â¿Â½11-90-1 et seq.
Adult residential care homes (Draft) Hawaii Administrative Rules Ã¯Â¿Â½11-101-1 et seq.
General Approach
The Department of Health has developed proposed rules for a new assisted living category and revised rules for adult residential care homes.
In 1994, a multi-member task force was created by House Concurrent Resolution 377 to make recommendations concerning assisted living and to explore the use of Medicaid waivers to support low income residents in assisted living.
The report was issued in December 1994 and recommended that the Department of Health be authorized to develop regulations to establish an assisted living program.
Members of the task force made site visits to facilities in Oregon and Washington.
Legislation authorizing the development of assisted living regulations was passed in April, 1995.
The draft regulations are expected to be finalized in 1998.
Definition
Assisted living facility means a facility as defined in Ã¯Â¿Â½321-15.1, HRS.
The facility is a building complex offering dwelling units to individuals and services to allow residents to maintain an independent assisted living lifestyle.
The environment of assisted living is one in which meals are provided, staff are available on a 24-hour basis and services are based on the individual needs of each resident.
Each resident, family member, and others work together with the facility staff to assess what is needed to support the resident in his or her greatest capacity for living independently.
The facility is designed to maximize the independence and self-esteem of limitedmobility persons who feel that they are no longer able to live on their own.
Assisted living means encouraging and supporting individuals to live independently and receive services and assistance to maintain independence.
All individuals have the right to live independently with respect for their privacy and dignity, fee from restraints.
Adult residential care facility means any facility providing 24-hourliving accommodations, for a fee, to adults unrelated to the family, who require at least minimal assistance in ADLs, but who do not need the services of an intermediate care facility.
There are two types of homes.
Type I homes serve five or fewer residents and Type II serve six or more residents.
Adult residential care homes may obtain an extended care license to serve a limited number of residents who meet the nursing home level of care.
Unit
Assisted living The draft rules require apartment units with a bathroom, refrigerator and cooking capacity, including a sink and a minimum of 220 square feet, not including the bathroom (sink, shower and toilet).
The cooking capacity may be removed or disconnected depending on the needs of the resident.
Other requirements include wiring for phone and television, a private accessible mail box and a call system monitored 24 hours by staff.
Adult residential care homes The current rules require that single rooms have 90 square feet and multiple occupancy rooms 70 square feet per occupant.
One toilet is required for every eight residents, one shower for every 14 residents and one lavatory for every 10 residents.
Tenant Policy
Assisted living facility Each facility must develop admission policies and procedures which support the principles of dignity and choice.
The policies include a listing of services available, the base rates, services included in the base rates, services not provided but which may be coordinated and a service plan and contract.
Facilities must also develop discharge policies and procedures which allow 14 days notice for behavior, other needs that exceed the facility's ability to meet or the resident's established pattern of non-compliance.
The rules do not specify who may be admitted and retained.
Rather, each facility may use its professional judgement and the capacity and expertise of the staff in determining who may be served.
Adult residential care homes Homes without an extended care license may not serve residents needing nursing home care.
Type I extended care homes may serve no more than two residents qualifying for nursing home care and Type II homes may serve no more than 10% of its residents needing this level of care.
Services
Assisted living facilities shall provide awake, 24-hour on-site staff, three dietician approved meals a day, laundry services, opportunities for individual and group socialization, services to assist with ADLs, nursing assessment and health monitoring, housekeeping, medication administration and services for residents with behavior problems (staff support, intervention and supervision), and recreational and social activities.
Facilities must also arrange or provide transportation, ancillary services for medically related care (physician, pharmacist, therapy, podiatry), barber/beauty care, hospice, home health and other services.
Service agreements are developed using negotiated risk principles.
Financing
The report suggested that land policies should be reviewed and modification of zoning requirements made to allow existing housing stock to be used.
State loans and bonds would be made available to at favorable interest rates to stimulate development.
The report recommended consideration of providing a higher level of service in residential care facilities as a means of maximizing existing buildings to meet new needs.
A resolution passed the legislature directing the Medicaid Agency to study the feasibility of using a Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Waiver to finance services.
Medication
Assisted living facilities The draft rules allow assistance with self-administration and administration of medication as allowed under the nurse practice act.
Staffing
Assisted living facilities must have licensed nursing staff available seven days a week to meet care management and monitoring needs of residents.
Adult residential care homes Licensees must submit a plan showing how they will obtain a registered nurse and case manager.
Sufficient staff must be on duty 24-hours a day to meet resident needs.
Training

IDAHO
Citation
Residential Care Facilities.
Idaho code Ã¯Â¿Â½ 39-3301 et seq., Idaho Administrative Rules Title 3, Chapter 22., Ã¯Â¿Â½ 70 et seq.
General Approach
The Governor's long term care policy statement includes the following:
"amending the current federal waiver and make changes to state law and rules necessary to create a system of long-term care for elderly or disabled adults.
Such a system will allow for the provision of client- or family-directed services whenever possible and for the provision of services in the least restrictive, most cost-effective setting (including assisted living, personal care, and other community-based services).
In 1996, the legislature passed HB 742 which made changes in the state's residential care facility rules.
Regulations implementing the law are being developed.
Medicaid is considering adding assisted living as a covered service under the HCBS waiver, however legislation has not passed to authorize coverage.
A task force has been to make further recommendations and a report is expected to be issued in 1999.
The supply of RCFS has increased from 175 facilities and 3,500 beds in 1996 to 227 and 4,902 in 1998.
Definition

General Approach
The legislature has approved two assisted living projects.
A "supportive living" facility model has been developed by the Department of Public Aid for Medicaid beneficiaries who are frail elderly or have disabilities and need assistance with activities of daily living.
It targets lighter need nursing facility residents who are unable to remain in their homes.
A supportive living facility (SLF) may be converted nursing home units or free standing buildings that integrate housing, health, personal care and supportive services in home-like residential settings.
The program is consistent with the definition of assisted living used by the federal 1915 c Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Waiver program.
The SLF program was developed with the assistance of advisory groups composed of members of the nursing home industry, advocates, consumers, long term care experts and the aging network.
A request for proposals was issued in October 1997.
Bids were received for a total of 1486 units.
Two bids were received from nursing homes seeking to create 46 units.
The approved waiver can serve up to 750 Medicaid residents the first year, 1,750 Medicaid residents in the second year and 2,750 Medicaid residents in the third year.
The Department on Aging is testing a Community Based Residential Facilities service model.
Services will be reimbursed as home care services through the Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Waiver or state funds.
The pilot may include three facilities and serve no more than 360 people.
The authorizing statute allows the programs to serve people with short or long term needs as a means of relieving family caregivers.
Projects may offer, directly or through contract, services that preclude admission to a nursing home.
Sites that continue to be in compliance with the demonstration project rules will be eligible for annual renewals "until an assisted living or similar licensure model is established by legislation."
Two facilities have been selected, including an Alzheimer's care facility.
The Department may contract with a third program involving a nursing home seeking to convert its facility.
If no applicant is forthcoming, another housing setting can be chosen.
Definition
Shelter care facility means a facility licensed under the nursing home care act that provide maintenance and personal care but does not provide routine nursing care.
Supportive living facility (SLF) means a residential setting that provides or coordinates flexible personal care services, 24-hour supervision and assistance (scheduled and unscheduled), activities and health related services with a service program and physical environment designed to minimize the need for residents to move within or from the setting to accommodate changing needs and preferences; has an organized mission, service programs and a physical environment designed to maximize residents' dignity, autonomy, privacy and independence; and encourages family and community involvement.
Community Based Residential Facilities (CBRFs) provide care that combines housing, personal and health-related services in response to the individual needs of those who need help in ADLs and IADLs.
Supportive and intermittent health-related services are available 24 hours per day, if needed, to meet scheduled and unscheduled needs, in a way that promotes self-direction and participation in decisions that emphasize independence, individuality, privacy and dignity in a residential surrounding.
A CBRF provides sleeping accommodations to three or more unrelated adults.
Units
Shelter care facility No more than four persons may share a room.
Single rooms must be 70 square feet and multiple occupancy rooms, 60 square feet per person.
One lavatory is required for every 10 residents and one shower/bath is required for every 15 residents.
A lavatory and shower/bath is required on each floor.
SLF To participate in the DPA program, facilities must have not less than 10 and no more than 150 apartments.
Freestanding sites must provide apartments with 350 square feet of living space, including closets and bathroom.
Apartments for individuals wishing to share the unit must have 500 square feet of living space, including closets and bathroom.
Units must have a full bathroom, lockable doors, emergency call system, heating and cooling controls, wiring for private telephone, access to cable television or satellite dish, a sink, microwave oven or stove, refrigerator.
Fifty percent of all apartments in a facility must have showers only (no bath tub) with non-skid surfaces and hand held shower heads.
Nursing homes converting a portion of a facility must offer apartments with 160 square feet for single occupancy and 320 square feet if two people want to share a unit.
Free standing sites must provide apartments with at least 350 square feet of living space for single occupancy.
Participants willing to share an apartment must have no less 500 square feet.
CBRFs The Department on Aging's pilot does not include specifications for the living unit, and rather, expect that market forces will determine what is developed.
Tenant Policy

Persons who have a communicable disease or are mentally ill, need treatment for mental illness, are likely to harm others, or is destructive of property or himself may not be admitted or retained.
CBRFs must execute a written contract with the tenant.
SLFs may serve frail elderly or disabled residents over age 22 who have been screened and determined to meet the nursing facility level of care criteria.
Residents may be discharged if they are a danger to self or others or have needs that cannot be met by the SLF.
The SLF must develop a service plan and execute a written contract with each resident that includes services the resident will receive and other terms of the agreement.

Facilities are expected, when possible, to involve family members in service planning.
Residents must be assessed within 24-hours of admission and updated at least annually.
Reimbursement
SLF For Medicaid residents, participating facilities must be willing to accept the SSI rate, which is currently $494 a month less a $90 personal needs allowance, as payment for room and board.

Assisted living: House Enrolled Act 1630 (1997)
Residential care facilities: 410 IAC 16.2 et seq.
General Approach
The state has not adopted legislation or administrative rules governing assisted living at this time although state agencies are investigating options for regulating and reimbursing assisted living.
In 1996, the Family and Social Services Administration completed a study of assisted living and made recommendations in response to a Concurrent Resolution adopted by the legislature.
In 1997, HB 1630 directed a legislative committee, the Health Finance Committee, to develop recommendations concerning licensing of assisted living.
The recommendations were based on the principles of promoting resident choice, dignity, privacy, autonomy, independence and encouraging aging-in-place.
The recommendations included a definition and minimum requirements for living units.
HB 1630 also directed the Indiana State Department of Health to identify, contact and survey all facilities that market, advertise or identify themselves as assisted living.
The survey was to determine the number and type of units, services provided, manner of service provision and the steps taken to provide for choice, dignity, privacy, autonomy, independence and aging-in-place.
The survey was completed in November 1997.
HB 1630 also directed the Community Home Options to Institutional Care for the Elderly and Disabled (CHOICE) Board, which advises the Division of Disability, Aging and Rehabilitative Services, to establish long term care goals for the state that include an array of services, including assisted living, and to recommend legislation, policies and rules to implement a system and other items.
The CHOICE Board adopted a vision statement, goals and objectives on September 23, 1997 which included assisted living licensure and coverage under Medicaid.
The Board forwarded the recommendations on assisted living to the Health Finance Commission in August 1997.
A disclosure bill (SB 436) passed during the 1998 legislative session.
The bill requires that all housing with services establishments complete a disclosure form and send the form along with a copy of the resident contract to the Division of Disability, Aging and Rehabilitation Services.
An establishment may not use the term "assisted living" if it has not filed a disclosure form.
The bill also lists specific information that must be included in the resident contract.
This requirement goes into effect September 1, 1998.
The form includes the following information: the name and address of the owner and managing agent, description of services provided and the base rate, resident contracts, additional services available and their fees, the resident contact, the process for modifying and terminating the contract, description of the complaint resolution process and criteria for determining who may continue to reside in the establishment.
A housing with service establishment is defined as an establishment providing sleeping accommodations to at least five residents and offering or providing for a fee at least one regularly scheduled health related service or at least regularly scheduled supportive services.
Health related services means attendant and personal care services, professional nursing services and central storage of medications.
Supportive services means personal laundry, handling or assisting with personal funds, arranging for medical services, health related services or social services.
The following summaries describe the assisted living recommendations and the current licensing requirements for residential care facilities.
None of the assisted living recommendations have been adopted as yet by the legislature.
Philosophy
Assisted living must be driven by a philosophy of service that emphasizes choice, personal dignity, autonomy, independence, and privacy.
It should enhance a person's ability to age-in- place in a homelike setting while services intensify or diminish as the individual's needs change.
Definition
Assisted living recommendation Assisted living provides, coordinates or arranges activities; personal and health related services; 24-hour supervision and assistance (scheduled and unscheduled) in a homelike setting; minimizes the need to move; accommodates changing needs and preferences; maximizes choice, dignity, autonomy, privacy and independence; meets federal, state and local requirements accommodates multiple funding options and encourages family and community involvement.
Residential care facilities Residential care facility means a facility that provides room, food, laundry and occasional assistance in daily living for residents who need less services than the degree of service provided by a comprehensive care facility (nursing home).

Units
Assisted living recommendation Living units should include an opportunity for single occupancy, except at the request of the resident.
Each unit should include a sleeping area, a living area, an accessible bathroom and a kitchenette.
The kitchenette should include an area for hot and cold food preparation, sink, storage, and appliances that can be removed or disabled.
There should be minimum square footage requirements, resident controlled climate controls, lockable doors, emergency call system, telephone jacks, common areas, including physical fitness options and meal service.

Residential care facilities The rules do not allow anyone needing nursing care to be admitted or retained.
Residents may need only occasional assistance with activities of daily living.
Services
Assisted living recommendation Services should include housekeeping, congregate dining, assistance with ADLs and medication administration and reminders.
Each resident should have a care plan which is updated regularly and negotiated risk agreements should be developed when indicated.
Service provisions should not inhibit services provided through Medicare and Medicaid.
Residential care facilities Personal care, supervision of nutritional status, assistance with selfadministration of medications or administration by qualified personnel are allowed services.
The rules state that "each resident shall be assisted in or occasionally given personal care as needed."
Reimbursement
Assisted living recommendation The report recommends coverage through a Medicaid waiver that allows residents to retain sufficient income to cover the room and board costs (eg., 300% optional eligibility category).
This would not preclude use of other publicly funded programs.
Medications
Residential care facilities Medications may be administered under physician's order by licensed nursing personnel or qualified medication aids.
Other treatments may be given by nurses aides upon delegation by licensed nursing personnel.
Staffing
Assisted living recommendation Twenty four hour staffing should be required.

Staff Prior to working independently, each employee shall be given an orientation of the facility by the supervisor.
Orientation of all employees shall include: * Instructions on the needs of the specialized populations served in the facility; * A review of the facility's policy manual and applicable procedures including organizational chart, personnel policies, appearance and grooming and resident rights; * Instructions in first aid, emergency procedures and fire and disaster preparedness, including evacuation procedures; * A detailed review of the appropriate job description, including a demonstration of equipment and procedures required of the specific position to which the employee will be assigned; * Review of ethical considerations and confidentiality in resident care and records; * For direct care staff, personal introduction to and instruction in, the particular needs of each resident to whom the employee will be providing care; and * Documentation of orientation in the employee's personnel record.
Direct care staff must complete nurse aid training.
The training program may be established by the facility and training must commence within 60 days of employment.
Training includes: * 30 hours of classroom instruction including orientation to the facility, policies, duties, basic nursing skills, clinical practice, resident safety and rights, and the social and psychological problems of residents; and * 75 hours of supervised training under supervision of a licensed nurse.
An ongoing in-service training that includes prevention and control of infection, fire prevention, safety and accident prevention and the needs of the specialized populations is also required.
Inservice training programs shall contain means to assess learning by participants.
These may include testing such as self-graded, before and after tests, clinical practice sessions under supervision, instructor assessment, etc.
Monthly in-service training shall be conducted for nursing staff.
In addition, for personnel administering medications, no less than eight programs on medication administration shall be offered per year.
Monitoring
Assisted living recommendation A quality assurance/improvement process that covers resident satisfaction, education, choice of providers and quality service should be developed.
Residents who are Medicaid beneficiaries would be assessed through the preadmission screening program (a requirement for waiver services) and receive ongoing case management through an Area Agency on Aging or other appropriate agency.

Citation
SB 1560 (1997).
Adult residential care facility, Louisiana Revised Statutes Annotated Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2151 et seq.; LA administrative code title 48, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 8901 et seq.
General Approach
A public hearing on draft rules was scheduled for May 29, 1998.
The proposed rules would create core requirements for adult residential care facilities plus three modules for assisted living facilities, personal care homes and shelter care facilities.
The modules contain separate requirements for administrators, staff training and living units.
The draft states that the purpose of the regulations is to promote the availability of appropriate services for elderly and disabled persons in a residential environment, enhance the dignity, independence, privacy, choice and decision-making ability to the residents; and promote the concept of aging-in-place.
SB 1560, passed in 1997, creates a pilot program to test the feasibility of covering assisted living under Medicaid.
The project will be implemented by the Department of Health and Hospitals.
A task force was appointed to draft guidelines for the project.
The project will include two assisted living facilities.
Medicaid funds are approved for the pilot.
The project "shall maximize the independence of the elderly while providing the assistance that the special needs of this population require."
The bill defines assisted living as "a residential congregate housing environment combined with the capacity by in-house staff or others to provide supportive personal services, twenty four hour supervision and assistance, whether or not such assistance is scheduled, social and health related services to maximize residents' dignity, autonomy, privacy, and independence and to encourage facility and community involvement."
One rural and one urban site will be selected through an RFP.
Each facility may serve up to 30 Medicaid beneficiaries.
Residents must be offered a chance to live in private quarters with a lockable door, bedroom, kitchenette and bathroom.
The Louisiana Advisory Committee on Assisted Living was created which includes five state agency representatives, the state fire Marshall, two legislators, and 10 public members representing associations, consumers, providers and architects.

Assisted living facilities Title 22, MRSA Ã¯Â¿Â½7902
General Approach
Governor King signed legislation April 11, 1996 which revised the state's assisted living program.
Emergency rules were effective in October 1997 and the rules will be finalized in the Spring of 1998.
The bill created several levels of assisted living with varying licensing based on the level of service provided.
Assisted living services may be provided by residential care facilities and congregate housing providers.
However, the licensure requirements do not apply to congregate housing settings offering only meals and housekeeping services.
Licensing is optional for congregate housing providers offering personal care.
Licensure is required for congregate housing providers offering personal care and administration of medication, and/or offering nursing services.
Full licenses may be issued for two years if the facility is in substantial compliance with the rules and has no history of health or safety violations.
The number of residential care facilities has increased significantly since Maine tightened the nursing home level of care criteria in 1994.
Thirty one nursing homes have converted wings and 5 entire facilities have converted to residential care.
Four nursing homes have closed.
While there is no CoN requirement, the state agency issues an RFP for residential care facilities interested in contracting with the Medicaid program.
In 1996, the legislature also passed a bill that creates an expedited certificate of need review for nursing facilities which convert and de-license beds and later seek to re-license the beds as part of the nursing facility within four years.
Definition
Assisted living services means the provision by a single entity of housing and assistance with ADLs and IADLs.
Assisted living services must be provided by the provider of housing either directly by that provider or indirectly through written or verbal contracts with persons, entities or agencies.
Services may include, but are not limited to, personal supervision; protection from environmental hazzards; ADLs; administration of medication; diversional, motivational or recreational activities; dietary services; and nursing services.
Congregate housing services program means a comprehensive program of supportive services, including meals, housekeeping and chore assistance, case management and other services that are delivered on the site of congregate housing and assist occupants to manage ADLs.
Congregate housing services may also include personal care assistance, with or without supervision, or assistance in the administration of medication and nursing services subject to the licensing requirements.
Level I residential care facility (formerly known as adult foster homes or certain six bed boarding homes) means a residential care facility with a licensed capacity of six or fewer residents.
Level II residential care facility means "a house or other place that is licensed to care for seven or more residents that is maintained wholly or partly for the purpose of providing residents with assisted living services.
These are facilities with three or more employees who are not owners and not related by blood or marriage to the owner.
Unit Requirements
CHSPs are multi-unit residential buildings and state and local building codes for such buildings are applied.
The regulations require that all licensed CHSPs be inspected using Chapter 18, New Apartment Buildings, NFPA, Life Safety Code.
These rules require a food service area, bathroom and bedroom.
The statute indirectly addresses requirements for living units in congregate housing.
The definition of personal care assistance implies that only facilities consisting of private apartments can be licensed as CHSPs. definition states:
"Personal care assistance means services provided in group residential settings consisting of private apartments including assistance with activities of daily living and the instrumental activities of daily living and supervision of residents self-administering medication."
In addition, the definition of nursing services also requires that they be provided in "group residential settings consisting of private apartments."
However, these definitions do not apply to residential care facilities.
Level I residential care facilities must offer 100 square feet for single room and 80 square feet for double rooms.
Bathrooms and showers/tubs must be based on the needs of residents.
No more than two residents may share a room.
Level II residential care facilities must offer 100 square feet for single room and 80 square feet per resident for double rooms.
No more than two residents may share a room.
Facilities offering apartment style units must have a fire extinguisher.
Facilities in which the bedroom and kitchenette are not physically separate have 30 square feet deducted from usable floor space to determine if the bedroom meets code.
Bathrooms are required for every six residents and shower/tubs for every 15 residents.
Tenant Policy
The rules encourage aging in place and have very flexible policies to do so.
In its application, facilities must describe who may be admitted and the types of services to be provided.
Facilities may discharge tenants who pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others, damage property or whose continued occupancy would require modification of the essential nature of the program.
The rules also require facilities to permit reasonable modifications at the expense of the tenant or other willing payer to allow persons with disabilities to reside in licensed facilities.
Facilities shall make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities unless they impose an undue financial burden or result in a fundamental change in the program.
RCF II facilities may care for people who qualify for nursing home care, but professional or skilled services for these residents must be provided by a home health agency or a private duty nurse.
Nursing needs of residents who do not meet the nursing home criteria may be met by registered and licensed nurses employed by the facility.
Services
Assisted living services include a wide range of care (see definition above).
Congregate housing sites licensed as assisted living providers must offer at least coordination, housekeeping, personal care assistance, at least one meal a day, chore services and other goods and services identified in the service plan.
CHSPs may offer personal assistance services, assistance with administration of medication and nursing services that are provided by licensed nurses and certified medication aides.
Facilities with Alzheimer's disease/dementia units must provide individual and/or group activities covering gross motor activities, self care activities, social, crafts activities, sensory enhancement activities, outdoor activities and spiritual activities.
Reimbursement
The FY 97 state budget included funds to support a demonstration project for 75 CHSP units.
State officials developed a reimbursement methodology for the demonstration.
The Medicaid program provides reimbursement for personal care services in RCFs under the state plan in "Private Non-Medical Institutions" (Residential Care Facilities).
Reimbursement is also available under the HCBS waiver for people living in congregate housing facilities.
A case mix system is expected to be implemented for residential care facility residents based on functional and other data collected on residents.
The state developed an MDS for Residential Care Assessment (MDS-RCA).
Data is collected at admission, annually, semi-annual reviews, and upon discharge.
The annual MDS-RCA form contains the following sections: identification information; oral/nutritional status; demographic information; oral/dental status; customary routine; skin condition; mood and behavior patterns; activity pursuit patterns; psycho-social well-being; medications; physical functioning; special treatments and procedures; continence; discharge potential; diagnoses; assessment information; and health conditions.
Quality indicators will be used to identify problem areas, exemplary care, and support care decisions.
Some of the quality indicators overlap with those developed for nursing facilities, but others provide more emphasis on relationships and psycho-social well-being.
The quality indicators include the following: prevalence of self/family participation in assessment; positive psycho-social well-being; bladder incontinence; bowel incontinence; bladder incontinence without scheduled toileting plan; occurrence of injury and falls; prevalence of behavioral symptoms toward others; behavioral symptoms toward others without behavior management; residents using nine or more prescription medications; residents using more than the state average number of medications; prevalence of cognitive impairment; cognitive impairment; level of activity; anti-psychotic drugs; awake at night; communication difficulties; signs of distress or sad/anxious mood; absence of positive psycho-social well-being; and prevalence of unsettled relationships.
Medications
A separate level of licensure is required for administration of medications in residential care facilities and congregate housing sites.
Staffing
CHSP The sponsor must assure that services will be provided to residents in accordance with individual service plans.
Since these facilities may house residents who do not require assisted living services, staffing standards are not needed.
Level I RCFs Operators are responsible for assuring that residents have an opportunity to receive individualized services that help them function and restore them to an optimal state of health or opportunities for constructive activity.
There are no other staffing standards.
Level II RCFs.
Staffing must be adequate to implement service plans.
RCFs serving over 10 residents must have two awake staff on duty at night.
The rules require a ratio of 1:12 residents from 7 AM to 3 PM; 1:18 from 3-11 PM and 1:30 from 11 PM to 7 AM.

Assisted living programs Title 10.07.14
General Approach
A legislative hearing on proposed rules combining multiple licensing categories was held on March 23, 1998.
They were expected to be final by July 1998.
The rules are based on a 1996 statute, SB 545, which created a licensing category for assisted living.
The bill was based on the report of a 19 member task force created by the Governor.
The task force report acknowledged that a number of programs are viewed as assisted living and found a lack of coordination among programs and differences in definitions.
The report recommended creation of a uniform definition, consolidation of regulatory authority under the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, a review of state and local fire and building codes and streamlined licensing procedures.
The report recommended that the task force continue and address issues related to people with disabilities, accreditation, reimbursement and the fiscal impact, and the relationship among community based assistance services, traditional nursing homes and assisted living.
Definition
Assisted living program means "a residential or facility-based program that provides housing and supportive services, supervision, personalized assistance, health related services, or a combination thereof to meet the needs of residents who are unable to perform, or who need assistance in performing the activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living in a way that promotes optimum dignity and independence for the residents."
Unit Requirements
Programs licensed after the effective date of the regulations must provide a minimum of 80 square feet of functional space for single occupancy and 120 square feet for double occupancy rooms.
No more than two residents may share a room.
Facilities previously licensed as domiciliary care homes must provide a minimum of 70 and 120 square feet for single and double occupancy, respectively.
Buildings with one to eight occupants must have one toilet for every four occupants and larger buildings must also have at least one toilet on each floor.
Showers/baths must be available for every eight occupants.
Tenant Policy
Facilities are licensed by the level of impairment if residents.
In general, programs may not serve anyone who, at the time of admission, requires more than intermittent nursing care; treatment of stage 3 or 4 skin ulcers; ventilator services; skilled monitoring, testing and aggressive adjustment of medications and treatments where there is the presence of, or risk for, a fluctuating acute condition; monitoring of a chronic medical condition that is not controllable through readily available medications and treatments; treatment for an active reportable communicable disease; or treatment for a disease or condition which requires more than contact isolation.
Residents may not be admitted if they are a danger to self or others and the danger cannot be eliminated through appropriate treatment modalities or are at risk for health or safety complications which cannot be adequately managed.
Programs may request a waiver to care for residents with needs that exceed the licensure level and demonstrate that it can meet the resident's needs and others will not be jeopardized.
Waivers for Level I and Level II programs may not be granted for more than 50% of the licensed bed capacity.
Level III programs may not receive waivers for more than 20% of capacity or 20 beds, whichever is less.
Services
Three meals in a common dining area, special diets, personal care, laundry, housekeeping, social and spiritual activities, medication management.
The program must facilitate access to health care and social services (social work, rehabilitation, home health, skilled nursing, physician services, oral health, counseling, psychiatric care and others).
Reimbursement
Medicaid is not currently planning to develop reimbursement for assisted living beyond the existing Senior Assisted Housing Program, which was considered assisted living prior to passage of the new law.
State-subsidized participants with incomes no greater than 60% of the statewide median income and assets no greater than $11,000 apply their income (less a $60 needs allowance) toward costs.
State-funded subsidies may cover the difference between the participant's contribution and the monthly fee, up to a maximum of $550 a month.
Those eligible for the State's Medicaid waiver may have incomes no greater than 200% of the federal SSI payment and assets no greater than $2000.The maximum monthly fee which may be charged for assisted living services for a Medicaid waiver participant is $1200/month (an increase to $1400 a month is planned at a future date).
Medicaid covers the full amount between the participant's contribution and the $1200 fee.
Of the 2500 residents in group homes, about 47 are covered by the waiver and an additional 350 residents are covered by a state-only subsidy.
The state Medicaid agency is considering an 1115 demonstration waiver proposal to integrate acute and long term care for dual eligibles (Medicaid and Medicare).
However, the Medicaid agency believes that an expansion of assisted living will increase Medicaid spending.
Elders are more likely to choose alternatives that are available, more attractive and less expensive than nursing homes which will delay spend down.
Market forces may lead to lower nursing home occupancy rates and closure of some facilities which also reduces Medicaid's exposure to future spending.
The law directs the Office of Aging to develop assisted living programs in conjunction with public or private profit or non-for profit entities, maximizing the use of rent and other subsidies available from federal and state sources.
These activities can include finding sponsors; assisting developers formulating design concepts and meeting program needs; providing subsidies for congregate meals, housekeeping and personal services; developing eligibility requirements in connection with the subsidies; adopting regulations governing eligibility; and reviewing compliance with relevant regulations.
Medications The regulations allow for the delegation of medication administration with on-site review every 45 days by the delegating nurse.
Staff who administer medications and are not health care professionals must complete a medication management course which is updated every two years.
Staffing
Programs must have staff capacity to deliver the care for which it is licensed.
See table.
Training
Administrators Assisted living managers must have adequate knowledge of the health and psycho-social needs of the population served; resident assessment process; use of service plans; cuing, coaching and monitoring residents who self-administer medications with and without assistance; providing assistance with ambulation personal hygiene, dressing, toileting and feeding; residents' rights; fire and life safety; infection control; basic food safety, basic first aid; basic CPR; emergency disaster plans; and individual job requirements of all staff.
Staff must participate in an orientation and ongoing training program to ensure that residents receive services that are consistent with their needs and generally accepted standards of care for the specific conditions of those residents to whom staff will provide services.
Staff must receive initial and on-going training in: fire and life safety, infection control, including standard precautions; basic food safety; basic first aid; emergency disaster plans; and individual job requirements as appropriate to their job.
Staff must have knowledge in: health and psycho-social needs of the population served as appropriate to their job responsibilities; resident assessment process; use of service plans; and resident rights
If job duties involve the provision of personal care services, staff must have knowledge in cuing, coaching and providing assistance with ADLs.
Background Check
Applicants must document any felony conviction of the applicant, assisted living manager or household member.
Management must conduct either a criminal history records check or a criminal background check consistent with Ã¯Â¿Â½19-1901 et seq. Annotated Code of Maryland.
Monitoring Under the law, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene may delegate monitoring and inspection of programs to the Office on Aging and the Department of Human Resources or local health departments through an interagency agreement.
Fees
$25 a year for programs monitored by the Department of Human Resources or the Office on Aging; $100 a year for programs inspected and monitored by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
For programs with 16 beds or more, $100 a year plus $6 per each bed over 15.

Assisted living 651 CMR 12.00
General Approach
Chapter 354 (Acts of 1994) was signed into law in January 1995 and creates a process for the certification of assisted living facilities by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs.
The law provides that the regulations "shall be sufficiently flexible to allow assisted living residences to adopt policies and methods of operation which enable residents to age-in-place."
To be certified, residences must submit information such as the number of units and number of residents per unit, location of units, common spaces and egress by floor; base fees to be charged; services to be offered and arrangement for delivering care; number of staff to be employed and other information required by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs.
The buildings are considered residential use for applying appropriate building codes.
In 1996, sixty assisted living residences received deemed certification and 20 residences were fully certified with a total of 3700 units.
By March 1998, 93 residences with 5,116 units had been certified.
The Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) and the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency (MIFA) provide loans for assisted living.
The MHFA "Elder CHOICE" program is designed to support development of appropriate housing and ADL assistance for frail elders.
The agency's RFP indicates that assisted living offers a supportive residential environment which maximizes the ability of elders to live independently and reduces the need for costly institutionalization.
MHFA has approved 14 projects with 900 units.
Most projects require that 20% of the units be set aside for low income residents and two projects have a 50% set aside.
The Medicaid Group Adult Foster Care program, which reimburses assisted living for Medicaid recipients, has certified 70 programs of which 30 are located within certified assisted living residences and serve 312 beneficiaries.
Definition
Assisted living residence is any entity, however organized, whether conducted for profit or not for profit, which meets all of the following criteria:
Provides room and board; provides, directly by employees of the entity or through arrangements with another organization which the entity may or may not control or own, assistance with activities of daily living for three or more adult residents who are not related by consanguinity of affinity to their care provider and; collects payments or third party reimbursements from or on behalf of residents to pay for the provision of assistance with the activities of daily living.
Unit Requirements
Units must be single or double occupancy with lockable doors.
New construction must provide for private baths.
Existing buildings may qualify if they provide private half baths and one bathing facility for every three persons.
All facilities must provide, at a minimum, either a kitchenette or access to cooking capacity for all living units.
Cooking capacity is defined as each resident having access to a refrigerator, sink, and heating element.
Facilities must comply with all federal and state laws and regulations regarding sanitation, fire safety, and access by persons with disabilities.
The Secretary of Elder Affairs is authorized to waive the requirements for bathrooms and bathing facilities when determined to meet public necessity and to prevent undue economic hardship as long as the residence provides a home-like environment and promotes privacy, dignity, choice, individuality and independence.
Tenant Policy
The statute does not allow people needing 24-hour skilled nursing supervision to be admitted or retained in an assisted living residence.
Facilities may admit and retain residents in need of skilled nursing care only if the care will be provided by a certified provider of ancillary health services or by a licensed hospice and the provider does not train the facility staff to provide skilled nursing care.
To qualify for reimbursement under the Medicaid Group Adult Foster Care program, tenants must require daily assistance with at least one ADL and assistance with managing medications as documented by a physician and a nursing assessment; be at risk of requiring nursing home placement; be chronically disabled; and require 24-hour supervision.
Services
Chapter 354 requires that residences all provide or arrange for opportunities for socialization and access to community resources; supervision or assistance with ADLs identified in a plan of care (at a minimum residences must offer support for bathing, dressing and ambulation); instrumental activities of daily living; self-administered medication management; timely assistance to urgent or emergency needs by 24-hour per day on-site staff, personal emergency response systems, or any additional response systems required by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs; up to three regularly scheduled meals per day (minimum of one meal per day).
The administrator may arrange for the provision of ancillary health services in the facility but may not use facility staff for these services unless the staff is an employee of a certified provider of ancillary health services and/or an employee of a licensed hospice.
Nursing services provided by a certified provider of ancillary health services such as injection of insulin or other drugs used routinely for maintenance therapy of a disease may be provided to residents.
All residents must have an individual services plan that is developed prior to admission and reviewed/reassessed at least every six months or when health status or family circumstances change.
Twenty-four hour nursing services are not allowed.
Skilled services may only be provided by a certified home health agency on a part time or intermittent basis.
Medical conditions requiring services on a periodic, scheduled basis are also allowed.
In addition, residents may "engage or contract with any licensed health care professional and providers to obtain necessary health care services ... to the same extent available to persons residing in private homes."
The initial draft of the regulations limited the provision of skilled services to 90 days in a one year period.
The attorney general's office issued an informal opinion that such a limit was contrary to the fair housing rules and the limitation was withdrawn in the final regulations.
The MHFA Elder CHOICE program requires, at a minimum, personal care (assistance with bathing, dressing, continence, ambulation, toileting, eating and transfers); housekeeping and maintenance, laundry, medical monitoring and transportation, up to three meals a day, twenty- four hour emergency response and service coordination and case management.
Financing
The Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency and the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency provide loans for the construction of assisted living projects.
Services for low income tenants are subsidized through Medicaid's Group Adult Foster Care (GAFC) which is a service available under the "state plan" rather than a Medicaid waiver.
GAFC provides an average of $33.70 per day for services and administrative costs.
To support low income residents who do not have sufficient income to pay for room and board, the state has created a special SSI living arrangement for assisted living residences.
The SSI payment standard is $948 a month for a single individual.
The regular community payment standard for an aged person living alone is approximately $620 a month.
Medications
Residence staff are allowed to remind residents to take medications, open containers, open prepackaged medications, read the label, observe, check dosage against the label and reassure residents that the proper dosage has been taken.
Staffing
No staffing specific guidelines are included concerning the type and number of staff.
However, the residence must maintain an ability to provide timely assistance to residents and to respond to urgent or emergency needs through on site staffing, personal emergency response or other means.
Training
Administrators The manager of an ALR must be at least 21 years old and have demonstrated administrative experience.
The manager must have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience in human services management, housing management and/or nursing home management.
The service coordinator of a residence must have a minimum of two years of experience working with elders or disabled individuals and a Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience.
Staff Prior to active employment, all staff and contracted workers having direct contact with residents and all food service personnel must receive a six hour orientation covering the following topics: * Philosophy of independent living in an ALR, * Resident bill of rights, * Elder abuse, neglect and financial exploitation, * Communicable diseases, * Communication skills, * Review of the aging process, * Dementia/cognitive impairment, resident health and related problems, * Job requirements and * Sanitation and food safety.
A minimum of 6 hours per year of ongoing education and training is required for all employees.
All employees and providers shall receive ongoing in-service education and on the job training aimed at reinforcing the initial training.
ALR staff and contracted providers of personal care services must complete an additional 54 hours of training prior to providing personal care services to a resident (34 hours general training and 20 hours of training specific to the provision of personal care).
The 20 hours of personal care training must be conducted by a qualified registered nurse with a valid Massachusetts license.
The 54 hours of training must include, but not limited to, the following topics: * Personal hygiene; * Self-administration of medications; * Elimination; * Nutrition; * Human growth and development; * Family dynamics; * Grief, loss, death and dying; * Mobility; * Maintenance of a clean, safe and healthy environment; home safety; and * Assistance with appliances.
Background Check
Applicants must assure that none of officers, directors, trustees, limited partners or shareholders have ever been found in violation of any local, state or federal statute, regulation, ordinance or other law by reasons of the individual's relationship to an assisted living residence.
Monitoring
The Executive Office of Elder Affairs conducts compliance reviews of assisted living residences every two years.
The reviews include inspections of the common areas, living quarters (by consent of the resident), inspection of the service plans, and a review of the resident satisfaction survey.
Board and Care
Rest homes provide room and board and personal care services to persons not requiring skilled nursing services.
Residents who need skilled nursing services may not be retained.
Home health care services may be provided in the home as long as the services are not skilled and the resident does not require 24-hour supervision.
Medication administration is available, however, most residents are able to self-administer their own medications.
The "responsible person" for the facility must be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or GED.
A license is not required for this position.
If the home provides medication administration, the responsible person must take a course in this area.
The home must have nursing and dietary consultants.
Care staff are not required to have training, although they must have access to consultations with professional disciplines.

Adult foster care: Large group homes R400.15101 et seq.
General Approach
The state licenses homes for the aged and adult foster care homes.
In 1995, a work group established by the Directors of Human Services Agencies and headed by the Department on Aging reviewed current trends in assisted living and supported updating and combining existing regulations in a single category of assisted living.
Following a reorganization of state agencies in 1996, responsibility for licensing was shifted to the Department of Consumer and Industry Services.
The Department formed a 40 member assisted living task force in the fall of 1997.
The task force is examining issues in four areas: consumer information and protection, fire and safety protections, services and affordability.
A report is expected in the summer of 1998.
Medicaid HCBS waiver will pilot test coverage of care in assisted living facilities in one county as long as services are delivered by community agencies rather than the facility's staff.
Thus far one provider is participating and 4 beneficiaries are being served.
Definition
Homes for the aged "A supervised personal care facility, other than a hotel, adult foster care facility, hospital, nursing home, or county medical care facility, that provides room, board, and supervised personal care to 21 or more unrelated, non-transient, individuals 60 years of age or older.
Home for the aged includes a supervised personal care facility for 20 or fewer individuals 60 years of age or older if the facility is operated in conjunction with and as a distinct part of a licensed nursing home."
Adult foster homes There are two levels of adult foster homes, those that serve 12 or fewer and those that serve between 13 and 20 residents.
An adult foster care facility is a governmental or non-governmental establishment that provides foster care to adults.
Adult foster care facilities include facilities and foster care family homes for adults who are aged, mentally ill, developmentally disabled, or physically handicapped who require supervision on an ongoing basis but who do not require continuous nursing care.
Unit Requirements
Homes for the aged Homes constructed, converted or expanded after 1981 must provide 100 square feet of usable space for single rooms and 80 square feet per resident in shared rooms.
Rooms may not be shared by more than four people.
Homes licensed prior to 1981 must offer at least 80 square feet of usable floor space for single rooms while shared rooms must provide 70 square feet per resident.
The regulations do not limit the number of residents that may share a room.
Toilet facilities are required for every eight residents per floor and bathing facilities for every 15 residents.
Adult foster homes A single bedroom must have at least 80 square feet of usable floor space; a multi-bed room must have at least 65 square feet of usable floor space per bed.
A maximum of two beds are allowed per bedroom unless the facility has been continuously licensed since the effective date of the rules or unless the resident (or the resident's representative) has agreed to reside in the multi-occupancy room, the home is in compliance with all state fire safety and environmental standards, and the bedroom provides no less than 70 square feet (65 square feet from homes licensed on or before December 31, 1976) of usable floor space per bed.
Tenant Policy
Homes for the aged Residents requiring nursing care that cannot be provided by a home health agency may not be admitted.
Residents requiring 24-hour nursing care or intensive nursing care may not be retained.
Physicians must certify that new residents are free from communicable diseases.
Residents with a mental condition disturbing to others may not be admitted or retained.
Adult foster homes may not accept, retain, or care for residents who require continuous nursing care.
This does not preclude the accommodation of a resident who becomes temporarily ill while in the home, but who does not require continuous nursing care.
All residents must be assessed by the facility as to the amount and type of services required by the resident.
Facilities may not accept or retain residents who require isolation or restraint.

Home care licensure: MS 114A.43 to 144A.48.
Minnesota rule, Chapter 4468 et seq.
General Approach
The Housing with Services Registration Act was effective in August 1996.
It requires registration for all facilities providing housing and services to elderly persons.
Services are provided through licensed home care provider agencies.
Draft rules for these agencies were released in February 1998 and were not expected to be final until the fall of 1998.
The Housing with Services agency may obtain such a license or contract with a licensed agency.
The state covers assisted living through its state funded Alternative Care (AC) program and the Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Waiver program.
The Alternative Care Program serves nursing home eligible residents whose income exceeds Medicaid eligibility levels but who would spend down to Medicaid levels within six months if admitted to a nursing home.
The HCBS waiver covers aged and disabled Medicaid recipients who meet the nursing home criteria.
Definition
Housing with services establishment means "an establishment providing sleeping accommodations to one or more adult residents, at least 80% of which are 55 years of age or older, and offering or providing for a fee, one or more regularly scheduled health-related services and two or more regularly scheduled supportive services, whether offered or provided directly or by another entity arranged for by the establishment."
The state's Medicaid waiver defines assisted living services as "up to 24-hour oversight and supervision, supportive services, home care aide tasks and individualized home management tasks provided to residents of a residential center living in their own units/apartments with a full kitchen and bathroom.
A full kitchen includes a conventional stove with an oven, refrigerator, food preparation counter space and a kitchen utensil storage compartment.
Unit Requirements
Housing with services No requirements stated.
Must meet appropriate building and fire codes for the structure.
Medicaid Assisted living policies under the waiver require full apartments with kitchens.
Tenant Policy
Housing with services The statute requires written contracts between the facilities and tenants that describe the registration status, terms, a description of services to be provided directly or through other arrangements, fee schedules and a description of the process through which the contract may be modified, amended or terminated, complaint procedures, retention policies and other items.
Medicaid waiver Participants for the AC and Medicaid waiver programs must be screened by the county preadmission screening team and must meet the nursing home level of care criteria.
Most residents fall into case mix categories A through D (see table).
Services
Assisted living home care providers must deliver at least one of the following and may deliver nursing services, delegated nursing services, other services performed by unlicensed personnel or central storage of medications.
Home care rules define health related services as professional nursing services or home health aide tasks such as administration of medication, routine delegated medical, nursing or assigned therapy procedures, assisting with body positioning or transfers of people who are not ambulatory, feeding clients who are at risk of choking, assistance with bowel and bladder control, devises and training programs, assistance with therapeutic or passive range of motion exercises, providing skin care and providing services to maintain hygiene during episodes of illness.
Home care aide tasks include preparing modified diets, medication reminders, household chores in the presence of sophisticated medical equipment or when care requires prevention of exposure to infectious or contagious disease and assisting with ADLs for ambulatory clients with no serious acute illness.
The Medicaid regulations allow the provision of assisted living services which include home care aide and home management tasks provided to clients of a residential center within living units and provided by management or by providers under contract with the center.
Home care aide tasks are differentiated from home health aide and include assisting with dressing, oral hygiene, hair care, grooming and bathing, if the client is ambulatory and has no serious illness or infectious disease, preparing modified diets, medication reminders, household chores in the presence of technically sophisticated medical equipment or episodes of acute illness of infectious disease.
The Medicaid waiver defines services as "supportive services include socialization (when socialization is part of the plan of care, has specific goals and outcomes established and is not diversional or recreational in nature), assisting clients in setting up meetings and appointments, and providing transportation (when provided by the residential center only).
Individuals receiving assisted living services will not receive both homemaking and personal care and assisted living services.
Individualized means that services are chosen and designed specifically for each resident's needs, rather than provided or offered to all residents regardless of their illness, disabilities or physical conditions.
Under the AC and Waiver programs, residents may also receive home health and skilled nursing which are reimbursed separately from the payment for assisted living services.
Financing
Rates for services are negotiated between the client and the provider with limits based on the client's case mix classification.
Service rates under the state funded AC program cannot exceed the state's Medicaid share of the average monthly nursing home payment.
The client pays for room and board (raw food costs only - meal preparation is covered as a service).
The cost of services in addition to assisted living services may not exceed 75% of the average nursing home payment for the case mix classification.
Under the HCBS waiver, rates for assisted living services are also capped at the state share of the average nursing home payment and the total costs, including skilled nursing and home health aide in addition to assisted living services, cannot exceed 100% of the average cost for the client's case mix classification.
For room and board, the SSI and state supplement payment in 1998 is $667 and the resident retains a personal needs allowance of $54 a month.
Residents whose income exceeds the SSI and state supplement level must "spend down" to the Medicaid Medically Needy level of $420 a month.
To allow spend down beneficiaries to meet the room and board allowance, all costs below $667 are considered as a "remedial care cost" and are therefore eligible expenses for meeting spend down requirements.
The statewide maximum FY 98 service rates assisted living services for elderly recipients ranged from $684 a month to $1595 a month depending upon the case mix classification.
Rates in a particular county could be higher or lower than the averages.
In addition to the assisted living rates, the waiver has caps for all waiver services including assisted living.
The Alternative Care Program rates for all services including assisted living ranged from $1072 to $200 a month.
Medicaid waiver maximum costs ranged from $1429 to $333 a month depending upon the case mix classification.
These rates are effective from October 1, 1997 to July 1, 1998 (see table).
Approximately 92.6% of the Elderly Waiver participants fall into categories A through E.
The state is implementing the 300% Medicaid eligibility option for waiver participants.
The maintenance level will remain at $667 and all excess income will be applied to the cost of waiver services.
The state will also revise the payment rates for services.
Medications
The assisted living home care provider rules allow medication administration.
Staff administering medications must be instructed by a registered nurse, the instructions must be written and the person must demonstrate competence in following the instructions.
Staffing
The Department of Health's standards for home care services licenses do not apply to the building itself.
Housing with services providers may not accept anyone for whom services cannot be provided and must staff to meet the needs of clients/residents.
Training
Staff Orientation and training are required based on the tasks performed by the worker.
Training requirements are specified for staff performing home care aide tasks, home management tasks and delegated nursing tasks.
Each person who applies for a license, provides direct care, supervision of direct care or manages services for a licensee must receive an orientation to home care requirements covering: an overview of the statute and regulations, handling of emergencies, reporting abuse/neglect, home care bill of rights, handling and reporting of complaints and services of the ombudsman.
Training and a competency evaluation are required for unlicensed people who perform assisted living home care tasks.
The curriculum includes: an overview of the Minnesota statutes; recognition and handling of emergencies and use of emergency services; reporting the maltreatment of vulnerable adults; home care bill of rights; handling of complaints; services of the ombudsman; observation, reporting and documentation of client status and of the care or services provided; basic infection control; maintenance of a clean, safe and health environment; communication skills; basic elements of body functioning and changes in body function that must be reported to an appropriate health care professional; and the physical, emotional and developmental needs of clients.
Staff who provide medication administration and active assistance with medications must complete the above training program, pass a competency test and be instructed by a registered nurse in the procedures to administer the medications to each client/residents.
The instruction is specific to each resident.
Staff providing home management tasks (housekeeping, meal preparation and shopping) must receive training on the bill of rights and orientation on the aging process and the needs and concerns of elderly and disabled persons.
Background Check
A license may be denied or suspended for conviction of any of 15 types of crimes listed in the regulations.
Each employee with direct contact with clients must sign a statement disclosing convictions of all crimes, except minor traffic violations.
Employees may be required to sign a release statement authorizing local authorities to provide the commissioner a history of criminal convictions.
Fee
Housing with Services buildings must pay a registration fee of $35 per address.

General Approach
Regulations are being revised and the licensing agency has formed a task force to make recommendations.
A report was expected in July 1998.
Definition
"A personal care home" is a home or institution which is licensed to give personal care to ambulatory residents who are not in need of nursing care but who, because of advanced age and/or physical/mental infirmities, are in need of assistance with their activities of daily living ordinarily provided by responsible family members.
This assistance extends beyond providing shelter, food, and laundry.
Examples of such assistance include but is not limited to the bathing, walking, excretory functions, feeding, personal grooming, dressing and financial assistance of such residents."

Residential care facilities.
Missouri revised statutes Ã¯Â¿Â½ 198.003 et. seq.; Missouri.
code of regulations, title 13 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 15-10.010 et seq.
General Approach
State agencies started to explore developing new regulations for assisted living in 1997.
No formal work group or plan has been established.
The state Division of Aging licenses two levels of residential care facilities.
RCFs must obtain a certificate of need.
Definition
Type I RCFs means any premises, other than a residential care facility II, intermediate care facility or skilled nursing facility, which is utilized by its owner, operator or manager to provide twenty-four hour care to three or more residents, who are not related within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity to the owner, operator or manager of the facility and who need or are provided with shelter, board and with protective oversight, which may include storage and distribution or administration of medications and care during short term illness or recuperation.
The definition of Type II RCFs adds supervision of diets, assistance in personal care, and supervision of health care under the direction of a licensed physician to the definition of Type I RCFs.
Facilities can be licensed to provide both levels of care within the same facility.
Tenant Policy
RCFs may admit or retain only residents who are capable mentally and physically of negotiating a normal path to safety using assistance devices or aides when necessary.
The rules allow RCFs to admit any resident who can be cared for by the facility directly or in cooperation with community resources or other providers of care with whom it is affiliated or has contracts.
Residents must be able to evacuate without physical assistance.
Unit Requirements
Homes licensed after 1987 must provide 70 square feet of space per resident in both private and multiple occupancy rooms.
A maximum of four residents may share a room.
Homes licensed prior to 1987 could provide 60 square feet per resident.
One tub/shower must be provided for every 20 residents and one toilet and lavatory for every six residents.
Services
Personal care services are reimbursed through Medicaid for residents who have chronic, stable conditions.
Tasks include bathing, hair care, oral hygiene, nail care, dressing, assistance with toileting, walking or transfers, meal preparation, and light housework.
Advanced personal care services include assistance for persons with altered body functions who have a catheter or ostomy, require bowel and bladder routines, range of motion exercises, applying prescription lotions or ointments and other tasks requiring a highly trained aide.
Reimbursement
Personal care and advanced personal care services are reimbursed as a Medicaid state plan service in residential care facilities.
The payment varies by resident based on an assessment and a plan of care completed by a case manager from the Division of Aging.
Facilities are reimbursed at an hourly rate of $11.37, for the number of hours authorized in the plan of care.
The actual number of hours authorized ranges from 5-6 hours to 70 or 80 hours a month.
The average number of hours authorized is 25-30 hours a month.
The payment rate is $11.37 an hour for personal care aides, $13.41 for advanced personal care aide services and $26.30 an hour for nursing visits.
The maximum payment is $1962 a month for people receiving advanced personal care services.
No more than one nursing visit a week can be authorized.
Very few residents receive advanced personal care and nursing visits.
The room and board rate is paid through the federal SSI payment and a state "cash grant" or SSI supplement payment.
Type I facilities receive a combined room and board payment of $645 a month and Type II facilities receive a combined payment of $776 a month.
With an average personal care payment of $302.10, the total payment would equal $947 in Type I facilities and $1078 in Type II facilities.
The maximum payments are $2607 and $2738 respectively for room and board and services.
The state is interested in developing a per diem rate with seven tiers based on an assessment by the facility and monitoring by the Division of Aging.
Training
Administrators of RCF II facilities must be licensed nursing home administrators or attend at least one continuing education workshop each calendar year given or approved by the Division on Aging.
They must also successfully complete a state approved Level I Medication Aide course unless a full time licensed nurse is available.
Licenses are not required for administrators of RCF I facilities although annual attendance at in-service training sessions is required.
Staff Prior to or on the first day that a new employee works in the facility, s/he shall receive orientation of at least one hour appropriate to his/her job function.
This shall include, at a minimum, job responsibilities, how to handle emergency situations, the importance of infection control and hand washing, confidentiality of resident information, preservation of resident dignity, how to report abuse/neglect to the Division on Aging, information regarding the employee Disqualification List and instruction regarding the rights of residents and protection of property.
A statement must be included in the personnel record of each employee that the employee was instructed on resident's rights, facility's policies, job duties and other orientation received.
Staff administering medications receive a certificate after completing a designated course developed by the University of Missouri-Columbia.
Background Check
Administrators must not have been convicted of an offense involving the operation of a long term facility or similar facility.
Staff No person on listed on the employee disqualification list maintained by the Division shall work or volunteer in the facility in any capacity.
Fees
Licensing fees are $100 for facilities of 3-25 beds; $300 for 25-100 beds; and $600 for 100+ beds.

General Approach
The state's Medicaid HCBS waiver reimburses services provided in personal care facilities and adult foster care homes.
Neither the licensing rules nor the waiver uses the term assisted living.
About 130 participants are covered in personal care facilities and adult foster care homes in 1998.
Definition
Personal Care Facilities A facility in which personal care is provided for residents in either a category A facility or a category B facility.
A facility must have a license for either category A or category B. Category A means the residents can self medicate, are mobile, continent and generally in good health.
Category B means residents may be ventilator dependent, incontinent, under chemical or physical restraint, or IV dependent.
A facility that does not have a category B license may obtain one if the residents in the facility decline in health.
Facilities may have up to five residents who fall in this category.
There were 58 facilities and 892 beds in 1996.
Unit Requirements
No more than four residents may reside in a single bedroom.
Each single bedroom must contain 100 square feet and each multi-bedroom must contain at least 80 square feet per bed, excluding toilet rooms, closets, lockers, wardrobes, alcoves or vestibules.
Each resident must have access to a toilet room without entering another resident's room or the kitchen, dining, or living areas.
There must be one toilet room for every four residents and one bathing facility for every 12 residents.
Tenant Policy
PCFs may provide personal care services to a resident who is 18 or older and in need of the personal care for which the facility is licensed.
A resident in a facility licensed as a category A facility may obtain third party provider services for skilled nursing care for no more than 20 consecutive days at a time.
A resident of a category B facility must have a signed statement from a physician agreeing to the resident's admission to the facility if the resident: * Needs skilled nursing care; * Needs medical, physical, or chemical restraint; * Is non-ambulatory or bedridden; * Has no bowel or bladder control; or * Is unable to self-administer medications.
Category B facility residents must have a signed statement renewed every quarter by a physical, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or a registered nurse who visited the facility within the calendar quarter covered by the statement and has certified that the resident's need can be met in the facility.
Category B facilities may serve five or fewer residents with the needs defined above.
Standards for operating a category B facility must include the standards for a category.
A facility (standards for physical, structural, environmental, sanitary, infection control, dietary, social, staffing, and record keeping components of the facility) as well as standards for assessment of residents, care planning, qualifications, and training of staff, restraint use and reduction, prevention and care of pressure sores, incontinence care, and the storage and administration of drugs.
Residents of category B facilities must be assessed upon admission for mobility, mental status, physical status, self-medication, dietary needs, personal hygiene needs, and social needs.
Within three days after admission a care plan must be developed that is prepared by a licensed health care professional, and to the extent practicable, with the participation of the resident, the resident's family, or the resident's legal representative.
Care plans must be updated at least quarterly.
Services
Services include residential services, such as laundry, housekeeping, food service, and either providing or making available provision for local transportation; personal assistance services with ADLs; recreational activities; and supervision of self-medication.
Personal care assistance is provided while encouraging residents to maintain independence and a sense of self-direction.
Reimbursement
The room and board payment under SSI is $589 a month and residents retain a personal needs allowance of $100.
The Medicaid waiver reimburses adult foster care home and personal care facilities between $520 and $1800 a month depending on the level of care needed by residents.
State agency field staff complete the assessment and determine the payment rate.
In addition to the room and board component, the basic service payment for residents is $520 a month.
Additional payments are calculated based on ADL and other impairments.
Points are calculated for each impairment.
The functions measured are: bathing, mobility, toileting, transfer, eating, grooming, medication, dressing, housekeeping, socialization, behavior management, executive cognitive functioning and other.
Each function is rated: 1.
With aides/difficulty--means people who need consistent availability of mechanical assistance or expenditure of undue effort; 2.
With help--means requires consistent human assistance to complete the activity but the individual participates actively in the completion of the activity; or 3.
Unable--means the individual cannot meaningfully contribute to the completion of the task.
Each point equals $33 a month.
For example, a resident consistently needing help with toileting would be scored a two and would earn $66 a month for that impairment.
Residents with severe impairments, totally dependent in more than three ADLs, can receive $44 a month for each point.
The total payment (services and room and board) ranges from $1084 to $2363 a month although very few participants have been approved at the highest rate.
About 40 recipients are receiving this service under the HCBS program.
The average payment is $42 a day
Medications
Staff may assist with self-administration of medications.
Licensed health care professionals may set up daily dose containers, verify physician's orders, and set up injectable medications.
Staffing
There must be sufficient staff on duty 24-hour a day to provide proper resident care and all related services.
Training
