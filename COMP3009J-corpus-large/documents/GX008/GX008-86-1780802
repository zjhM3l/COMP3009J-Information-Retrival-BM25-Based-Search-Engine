I am an Ecuadorian student working on my thesis at the Charles Darwin Research Station (CDRS) on the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
My thesis investigation is related to the ecology of Cinchina pubescens, an introduced tree that seriously damages the native and endemic Galapagos vegetation.
The study involves determining the distribution, seed bank dynamics, and phenological patterns of Cinchina pubescens in order to better understand its invasion dynamics.
Recent studies have shown that it reduces the cover and biodiversity of surrounding native vegetation.
Ultimately the life history information I am collecting will be used to design an effective management plan for the control and possible eradication of this noxious tree.
My study is the one of the first on the behavior of Cinchina pubescens in the unique Galapagos ecosystems.
For this reason there is very little information or resources available to me to design and carry out my experiment.
I am writing to ask you for information about materials and methods for measuring these above-mentioned traits.
I am particularly interested in learning about studies on seed dispersal, seed trap design and location, and experimental design.
I am also looking for information about seed sampling techniques, seed measurement techniques, as well as data analysis approaches.
Here on the Galapagos we have a limited access to the Internet.
I was able to find the titles of your publications, but was unable to access the text.
Likewise, I am unable to access the relevant literature for my study in our library.
Although rich in Galapagos literature, CDRS has a limited journal subscription.
For these reasons, I ask you to please send me the text of your articles as attached or pasted documents.
