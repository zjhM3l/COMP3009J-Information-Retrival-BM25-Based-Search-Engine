_______________________________________________________________________ 1995 National Trade Estimate _______________________________________________________________________ GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL This section of the report analyses trade policies of the six member states (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.)) of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
In 1994, the United States trade deficit with the GCC was $672 million, or $534 million more than that in 1993.
U.S. merchandise exports to the GCC were $9.6 billion, down $1.0 billion from 1993.
U.S. imports from the GCC totaled $10.3 billion in 1994, down $0.4 billion from 1993.
Available information indicates that the stock of U.S. foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia was $2.6 billion in 1993, $340 million greater than that in 1992.
U.S. direct investment in the U.A.E was $537 million in 1993, up from $466 million in 1992.
U.S. direct investment in the GCC is largely concentrated in petroleum.
As far as trade is concerned, the GCC is a loose confederation which serves only as a policy-coordinating forum for its members.
Since it cannot impose trade policies upon its member states, each is free to pass and enforce its own trade laws.
There has been growing cooperation among GCC members on certain issues, such as standards-setting, establishing tariff ranges, and cooperating on intellectual property protection.
There is also consideration being given to forming a customs union.
Continuing work on a free trade area between the GCC and the EU is also pushing the six member states to closer coordination, but remains stalled over the issue of energy taxes.
The United States seeks to strengthen common action among GCC members, as well as provide new impetus to the United States and the GCC countries to expand and strengthen our economic ties.
This effort was reinforced on January 16-17, 1994, when the most recent "U.S.-GCC Economic Dialogue" was held in Riyadh under the leadership of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
Most of the issues described below were addressed at this dialogue.
The next U.S.-GCC Economic Dialogue is scheduled for early 1995 in Washington.
IMPORT POLICIES
Tariffs
Many GCC countries maintain high (15 percent-20 percent) tariffs on products produced locally.
As the GCC moves to harmonize its tariff schedule, there is concern that a "highest common denominator" approach could significantly increase the number of products across the GCC that face high tariffs.
This is particularly the case in the U.A.E, which raised its tariffs from 1 percent to 4 percent in 1994, in accordance with a GCC decision.
Of the GCC countries, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the U.A.E. are members of the GATT and are in various stages of applying for WTO membership.
Kuwait, a GATT member since 1963, and Bahrain, who acceded in 1993, submitted WTO tariff bindings in April 1994 which were reluctantly accepted by the international community.
These schedules set tariff ceilings at 100 percent and 40 percent for Kuwait and Bahrain, respectively.
The U.A.E. and Qatar, however, are currently negotiating to have their WTO tariff bindings accepted by the March 31, 1995 deadline.
Saudi Arabia applied for GATT membership in July, 1993, but has not yet decided if it will embrace the additional requirements to join the WTO. Oman is in the process of deciding whether or not to join the WTO.
STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING, AND CERTIFICATION
As U.S. export interest in the region grows, the United States has become concerned with certain restrictive standards in various GCC member states.
In particular, shelf-life requirements throughout the GCC for processed foods are in many cases far shorter than necessary to preserve freshness, posing problems for U.S. exporters.
These standards were in some cases shortened, and began to be more vigorously enforced in 1993, creating considerable hardship for U.S. exporters.
For example the standard on eggs has been shortened from 6 months to 90 days, despite the fact that eggs shipped to the region from the United States are good for six months because they are refrigerated immediately.
In 1990, the United States entered into a highly successful arrangement with the Saudi Arabian Standards Organization (SASO) to encourage cooperation in the development of standards.
SASO's work frequently leads to creation of regional GCC standards.
the United States-SASO partnership, which includes a U.S. technical advisor in Riyadh funded by the United States government, has led to greater transparency in the Saudi system and has increased opportunities for American exporters to comment on draft Saudi standards.
The GCC plans to implement in 1995 a system for registering companies that comply with international standard ISO 9000.
The central accreditation organization will be the Gulf Standards Organization.
There will be an agency in each of the six countries to inspect factories, make recommendations, and issue registrations.
The GSO is negotiating with the European Union to put the program in place.
The EU is sending experts to help the GCC in technical and training aspects of the program, and to set up mutual recognition systems for certification and quality control mechanisms.
In January 1995, a GCC standardization official reported that the GSO has set some 580 unified standards for the GCC countries to date, and plans to increase that number to 1000 soon.
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT
All GCC countries maintain preferential buy-national policies and all except Bahrain maintain offset requirements requiring that a portion of any major (and usually military) government tender be subcontracted to local firms.
For example, Kuwait government procurement policies specify local products when available and prescribe a 10 percent price advantage for local firms in government tenders.
Offset regulations introduced in Kuwait since the liberation specify that foreign firms awarded government contracts worth over $17 million must invest 30 percent of the contract value in a project in Kuwait, the GCC or the rest of the Arab world.
Offset regulations are changing and complicated.
Saudi Arabian government procurement policies can strongly favor GCC nationals.
Under a 1983 Saudi Arabian decree, for example, contractors must sub-contract 30 percent of the value of the contract, including support services, to majority-owned Saudi firms.
In 1987 Saudi Arabia put new regulations in force giving priority in government purchasing programs to GCC products.
These items now receive up to a 10 percent price preference over non-GCC products in all government contracts, including sub-contracts awarded by foreign contractors.
Saudi Arabia required offsets in some military procurements and there is concern that they may do so increasingly in large commercial sales as well.
Oman provides a 10 percent price preference to Omani nationals in its government procurement, and is in the process of drafting further buy-national regulations.
In addition, Oman maintains an offset program with the United Kingdom which resulted from a major defense contract awarded to a British firm.
To date, offsets have been linked to the award of only this one defense contract.
The first such offset involved a joint venture between the United States company FSC and an Omani company to manufacture oilfield equipment in Oman.
The Omani government does not require that an offset involve a British investment but welcomes investment from any country under the program.
However, offsets have not become standard adjuncts to government contracts.
The U.A.E. has no requirement that a portion of any government tender be subcontracted to local firms.
There is a 10 percent price preference on procurement and tenders.
The U.A.E. requires a company to be registered in order to be invited to receive government tender documents.
To be registered, a company must have 51 percent U.A.E. ownership.
However, these rules do not apply on major project awards or defense contracts, where there is no local company able to provide the goods or services required.
The U.A.E. requires offset investments by winners of defense contracts.
The guidelines are complicated, but generally 60 percent of the technical value of the contract must be reinvested in the U.A.E.
This figure can be reduced, however, if the contractor meets certain conditions.
Bahrain, in its decree number 11 of 1985, provides for preference in government tenders to Bahraini and GCC products up to a price differential of 10 percent, provided the products meet standard specifications as to kind and quality.
Bahrain does not have an offset program.
Qatar requires foreign firms wishing to participate in government procurement tenders to bid through local agents.
Qatar gives a 10 percent price preference to local firms and a 5 percent price preference to GCC firms in all government procurement.
EXPORT SUBSIDIES
Saudi Arabia's food self-sufficiency policy involves paying farmers for their wheat at prices more than three times world levels.
This has led to wheat production far in excess of Saudi Arabia's domestic needs.
Saudi Arabia exports surplus wheat at highly subsidized rates in competition with the United States and other countries.
The government has recently cutback on the subsidy program, and is encouraging farmers to shift from wheat production to barley production, a crop for which Saudi Arabia still lacks self-sufficiency.
LACK OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
The GCC and many of its member countries lack a comprehensive set of laws and regulations to ensure effective intellectual property protection.
Some progress has been made in recent years.
Saudi Arabia enacted patent and copyright laws in 1989, the U.A.E. enacted copyright, trademark, and patent laws in 1992, Bahrain enacted a highly deficient copyright law in 1993, and Kuwait and Oman began drafting copyright laws in 1993.
Additionally, the GCC secretariat has declared the protection of intellectual property rights to be a priority and is working to facilitate this in the six member states, especially in the area of patent protection.
Presently, all GCC countries have trademark laws; Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E. have patent protection; only Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., and Bahrain have copyright protection in place, but in no case is protection adequate for U.S. or other non-Arab league works.
No GCC countries are members of the major intellectual property conventions, such as the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, or the Geneva Phonograms Convention, although there are plans to join by several GCC countries.
Saudi Arabia acceded to the Universal Copyright Convention April 13, 1994 and began enforcing copyright protections provided by the UCC July 13, 1994.
Despite the progress to date, IPR problems remain in the entire region due to a combination of inadequate or non-existent laws and lax enforcement.
Pirated motion pictures, video cassettes, computer software, computer manuals, and sound recordings are available in all GCC countries, and videotapes are produced for export in Bahrain.
Counterfeit products such as clothing, auto parts, and household products are also available.
Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia enacted copyright and patent laws in 1989.
The Saudis assert that the copyright law is fully consistent with international standards.
However, the United States has a number of concerns with the law, the most important of which is that foreign works published overseas before being published in the Kingdom are not protected.
Saudi Arabia has acceded to the Universal Copyright Convention, which obliges Saudi Arabia to offer protection to U.S. and other non-GCC member works.
Saudi Arabia's patent law provides a generally complete and adequate legal basis for protection.
Under the law a patent examination office was established, which to date has received over 3,000 patent applications.
While the examination office is moving with all deliberate speed, no patents have yet been granted.
As a result of the generally ineffective protection of copyrights of U.S. works, Saudi Arabia was placed on the "watch list" under the "Special 301" provision of the 1988 Trade Act.
U.S. companies estimate incurred over $211 million in losses due to copyright piracy in Saudi Arabia during 1994.
The United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.)
The U.A.E. had been one of the major sources of pirated sound and video recordings, which are produced for export by several firms who U.S. industry reports are primarily located in the Emirate of Dubai.
The U.A.E. has pledged to eliminate this piracy, and took a significant step in this direction by enacting in October 1992 a copyright law that makes this behavior illegal.
The Minister of Information announced that all pirates had until September 1994 to dispose of all pirated stock and cease illegal activity.
We are pleased that, after this time, the U.A.E. government has taken very effective steps to eliminate copyright piracy.
Several widely publicized enforcement efforts have virtually eliminated pirated video products from the shelves in the U.A.E..
However, U.S. industry reports estimate 1994 trade losses due to piracy at $108 million.
There are still problems with computer software.
Most hardware is still sold with pirated software inside, and hardware owners reportedly pirate new software directly from new computers in shops.
The U.A.E. also enacted, in 1992, patent and trademark laws.
The patent law contains a glaring deficiency in that it does not provide any patent protection for pharmaceutical products and provides only a 10-year patent term for pharmaceutical processes.
In 1994, a major U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturer reported that two of its patent protected products were being pirated at a factory in the U.A.E.
The U.A.E. government has announced its intention to form a committee to study and recommend improvements in the U.A.E. copyright law.
The government intends to adhere to the Berne Convention at the end of the year, at which time it expects to have fully implemented its copyright law.
Bahrain
Recent industry reports indicate that Bahrain has become an export center for pirated video cassettes.
Bahrain has enacted a new copyright law that contains serious deficiencies, including lack of protection for U.S. and other non-Arab League works, and lack of clear protection for sound recordings.
Bahrain does have strong patent and trademark laws.
Kuwait
Kuwait has had patent and trademark laws in effect since 1962, but penalties under both are so low as to be fairly ineffective in deterring illegal activities.
The patent law, moreover, excludes certain chemical inventions involving foods, pharmaceuticals and medicines, and grants a term of protection of only 15, rather than the standard 20, years.
It also contains provisions for compulsory licensing whenever a patent is insufficiently worked in Kuwait or is of "great importance to national industry."
Kuwait currently has no copyright law, but prepared a new draft law on copyrights in early 1993.
The United States has expressed its strong interest that the draft law clearly protect U.S. works and provide standards of protection consistent with modern international agreements.
The draft law on copyrights continues to languish.
Oman and Qatar
Oman and Qatar do not have either patent or copyright laws, though Oman is proposing to adopt the GCC standards for patent protection and is drafting a copyright law.
Both countries experience widespread copyright and trademark violations in their domestic markets.
Gulf Cooperation Council
The GCC Secretariat has prepared a draft patent law that would create one patent system for the member states.
The draft law would create a sound fundamental system but has several significant problems, including a lack of protection for pharmaceuticals (products or processes for production) and biological inventions.
In addition, the draft contains a broad compulsory licensing regime.
The GCC also has efforts to create common trademark and copyright laws, although these are not as far advanced.
SERVICES BARRIERS
Visa Issuance Policy
Saudi Arabia took steps to liberalize its business visa policy in 1993.
Formerly, all persons coming for business had to be sponsored by a local citizen, and the Saudi embassy or consulate required approval from the Foreign Ministry in Riyadh to issue a visa, resulting in substantial delays.
The new policy was aimed at improving upon the old system by eliminating the need for businessmen representing well-known U.S. firms to have a Saudi sponsor and by allowing businessmen whose firms are involved in joint ventures in the Kingdom can now obtain multiple-entry visas valid for six months.
Finally, in the above cases the Saudi embassy or consulate are to have the discretion to issue a visa without obtaining approval from the Foreign Ministry.
The new policies have not yet been fully implemented.
To get a business letter to the Kingdom, a chamber of commerce certified company now faxes a letter directly to the consulate, instead of going to the Foreign Ministry.
Though the procedure is simplified, the businessmen still need a sponsor in the Kingdom.
Few, if any, American executives have multiple entry visas.
Kuwait in 1992 significantly liberalized its visa policy for U.S. citizens.
U.S. citizens no longer need a Kuwaiti sponsor for travel to Kuwait on business.
U.S. business travelers receive 12 month, multiple entry visas.
Only in the case of extended visits (beyond 30 days) are residency visas and Kuwaiti sponsors required.
In recent years, Oman has liberalized its visa policy.
"No-objection" certificates can be obtained with the assistance of any of the major hotels where visitors may be staying.
The U.A.E. has now implemented a 1993 decision to issue 10-year, multiple-entry visas to American citizens for business and tourism, and to do away with the sponsorship requirement for a visa, on a reciprocal bases.
The United States now has a reciprocity agreement with Qatar for 10-year visas of which many U.S. citizens are taking advantage in their commercial dealings with Qatar.
Insurance
With the exception of the U.A.E., all GCC countries discriminate against foreign insurance companies, generally by restricting foreign participation (Kuwait), discouraging new applications (Bahrain), or requiring operation through a local sponsor (Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar).
Banking
Banks are variously restricted from entering GCC markets.
Saudi nationals must own 60 percent of any bank.
Banking is currently closed to foreigners in Kuwait; however the Central Bank of Kuwait has recommended amendments to Kuwait's commercial law which will allow foreign firms to hold minority shares in joint venture banks in Kuwait.
Bahrain has not issued licenses for new commercial banks since 1983, though the majority of commercial banks in Bahrain are foreign bank branches; Bahrain does encourage the establishment of offshore or representative offices of foreign banks.
Oman, Qatar, and the U.A.E. technically allow foreign banks to operate, but have refused new foreign banks from establishing operations on the grounds that their countries are "over-banked".
(The U.A.E. did allow one American bank to open a representative office in 1993.)
In 1994, the U.A.E. government blocked an attempt by a U.S. commodities firm from establishing a relationship with a U.A.E. firm whereby the U.A.E. firm would act as a broker in the U.A.E. and the United States firm would handle order execution in the United States for the U.A.E. firm.
The government justified its decision by maintaining that the U.A.E. firm in question would in fact have been a representative of the United States firm, and that the two firms should register according to U.A.E. regulations on establishing representative offices.
The U.A.E. government does, however, allow six other, non-U.S. brokerages to operate in the U.A.E. by appointing an introducing broker.
In those cases the introducing brokers are not registered as representative offices.
Shipping
In the past, Kuwait prevented access to government project cargo by U.S. shipping lines by giving the United Arab Shipping Company the right of first refusal on all government project cargoes.
Bahrain also favors the United Arab Shipping Company on cargo contracts for government projects.
Kuwait no longer applies this requirement to shipments from U.S. ports.
INVESTMENT BARRIERS
Foreign equity is limited to 49 percent in Kuwait, Qatar, and U.A.E.
(The U.A.E. has exempted the Jebel Ali Free Zone from this barrier, but products entering the U.A.E. from the Free Zone are treated as foreign products.)
Oman, too, generally has a 49 percent foreign equity limit.
However, joint venture industrial projects may be up to 65 percent foreign-owned.
Saudi Arabia has no legal restrictions on the percentage of foreign ownership; however, under current policy, wholly foreign-owned investment proposals are unlikely to receive government approval.
Moreover, Saudi government incentives such as tax holidays normally are not available unless there is at least 25 percent Saudi ownership.
Wholly foreign-owned branch offices are generally approved, however.
Only in Bahrain is 100 percent foreign equity sometimes allowed.
In some areas, such as real-estate, as well as in most shares of publicly traded companies, non-GCC investment is banned in all GCC countries.
OTHER BARRIERS
Agent and Distributor Rules
The requirement that a local agent be used in all sales transactions, as currently exists in Kuwait and Oman, can create problems for some U.S. firms.
Saudi law requires that in-country distributors be licensed by the Ministry of Commerce.
Only Saudi citizens can obtain licenses, although a recent GCC decision may broaden this to include GCC citizens.
Direct sales are possible except in the case of sales to government agencies, where a "service agent" is required.
The U.A.E. permits only 100 percent U.A.E.-owned firms or U.A.E. citizens to import any product into the country.
In 1993, Oman liberalized its agency laws slightly.
The change enables any importer to bring in goods without paying a commission to the relevant agent, provided that the goods are brought in through Omani ports or airports.
Termination of agency agreements can be difficult in all the GCC countries and may involve unreasonable financial losses to the foreign supplier.
A new commercial agency law adopted by Bahrain in November 1992 makes it easier to terminate agency agreements in cases where the agent has not carried out his responsibilities satisfactorily.
Import Licensing
The use of import licensing procedures to protect domestic industries or restrict importing to nationals occurs in all GCC countries except Bahrain.
Export Documentation Requirements
All GCC countries impose unusually complicated export documentation requirements for goods imported by the GCC.
The documents must be both certified by an approved Arab-U.S. Chamber of Commerce and certified by the consulate of the country for which the goods are destined.
In Oman, this documentation is not required if the importing company has an existing agency agreement with the United States exporter.
Corporate Tax Policies
Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait tax foreign companies at a higher rate than they tax domestic companies.
Additionally, several GCC countries tax royalties as if they were 100 percent profit, and maintain a variety of other tax policies considered unfair to foreign companies.
The Arab League Boycott of Israel
On September 30, 1994, the GCC announced that it would end adherence to the secondary and tertiary aspects of the Arab League Boycott of Israel, which eliminated a significant trade barrier to U.S. firms.
All GCC countries still enforce the primary boycott against Israel.
(See the Arab League chapter for further information.)
