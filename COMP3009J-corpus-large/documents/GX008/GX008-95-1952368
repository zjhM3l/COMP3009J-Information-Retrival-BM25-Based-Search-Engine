picture of a cow's face Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is one variety of a group of diseases known as "Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies" (TSEs).
TSEs cause microscopic holes in the brain, giving it a sponge-like appearance under a microscope.
TSEs are always fatal and affect both humans and animals.
BSE is the type of TSE that occurs in cattle.
Scientists believe cattle are infected when they eat feed that contains remnants of infected animals.
The most common human TSE is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
Scientists believe a new variant form of CJD is caused by consuming the brain and spinal cord of animals infected with BSE.
Neither BSE nor the new variant form of CJD has been found in the United States.
A single case of BSE was reported in a cow from Alberta, Canada in May 2003.

Steps to keep BSE from occurring in the U.S.
* The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) prohibits the imports of all ruminants and rendered animal products from countries with BSE.
Changes in U.S. policy toward Canada were announced Aug. 8 in a news conference.
(Ruminants are animals that chew their cud, such as cattle, sheep, goats, deer and bison.)
* A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) BSE Rule has prohibited feeding most mammalian proteins to ruminants since 1997.
* Feed mills, renderers, and other businesses in the feed industry in Washington are inspected by WSDA or FDA personnel for compliance with feed laws.
* Government and industry associations are educating ruminant feeders about BSE.
* Significant actions (PDF) have been taken to prevent the introduction and amplification of BSE in the United States.
Fish, pigs, chickens, and horses are not known to carry BSE so the protein derived from their bodies may be used in ruminant feed products.
