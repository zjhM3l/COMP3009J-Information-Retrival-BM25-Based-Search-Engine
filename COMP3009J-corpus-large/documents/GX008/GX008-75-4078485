The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms National Church Arson Task Force __________________________________________________________________ Church Threat Assessment Guide Cover _______________________________________________________________________ MESSAGE FROM NATIONAL CHURCH ARSON TASK FORCE The burning of churches is a particularly heinous crime because those who would attack our churches seek to strike at our most fundamental liberties and sources of personal support.
Historically, churches have served as places of sanctuary, centers of the community, and symbols of freedom.
The National Church Arson Task Force is committed to fully applying our investigative resources to determine the cause of those fires and arrest and prosecute those responsible for the arsons.
One aspect of this commitment is the dissemination of the Church Threat Assessment guide.
It contains valuable information on the steps that may be taken to prevent fires at churches, the steps to follow after an incident has occurred, the toll free telephone number, 1-888-ATF-FIRE, and the telephone numbers of ATF and FBI offices for providing authorities information about any acts of violence, or threats of violence, directed at churches nationwide.
We must all work together to solve and prevent these despicable crimes.
With your continued assistance and support, and your cooperation in applying the recommendations contained within this booklet, churches and congregations will be better protected from this type of violence.

CHURCH THREAT ASSESSMENT GUIDE
The following is a guide to assessing church vulnerability to arson and bombing attacks.
It should not be considered all inclusive.
Your local Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) office, FBI office, fire, police or sheriff's department should be con-tacted for additional guidance concerning a specific plan for your church.
Area Of Vulnerability
* Churches located in isolated or rural areas.
* Churches left unattended for extended periods of time.
* Churches with unsecured doors and/or uncovered windows leave weak points for forced entry by intruders.
* The absence of an adequate burglar alarm system provides a determined criminal with additional time for criminal activity.
* Heavy shrubs and outside vegetation, and/or the absence of sufficient perimeter lighting, provides security for criminals, not victims.
Affirmative Actions To Reduce Vulnerability
1.
Install perimeter floodlights outside the building.
Criminals can conceal their presence and activity from witnesses at night.
Adequate lighting that illuminates all points of entry (doors, windows, skylights, etc.) discour-ages them.
Interior lights in areas visible through exterior windows should be left on during all hours of darkness.
Exterior lights should have protective screens over them to prevent vandalism.
All lights should be checked weekly for serviceability.
Rela-tively inexpensive motion activated and/or timing equipment may be purchased to automatically turn lights on and off.
2.
Install an adequate fire and burglar alarm system.
Alarms should be installed by reputable local companies that can service and pro-perly maintain the equipment.
Please note that some municipalities or police depart-ments have enacted burglar alarm standards and will not respond to false alarms by inferior systems that frequently cause false alarms.
Check with your local police or sheriff's department.
3.
Solid wood or sheet metal faced doors provide extra integrity that a hollow core wooden door cannot.
Metal security grates or screens that cover the entire door and frame also provide added security.
A steel door frame that properly fits the door is as important as the construction of the door.
With the proper foundation of a sufficient door and frame, the most obvious consider-ation, door locks, can be addressed.
Long throw dead bolts of hardened steel are excellent deterrents to forced entry.
Many standard locks are easy to pick or break open.
Do remember that exits must remain operable for fire and life safety reasons.
4.
Install burglar-proof bars on screens, and large roof vents to prohibit access through them.
However, it should be noted that aesthetic or fire safety considerations often preclude their use.
If bars are used, they should be operable from interior and not limit exit or evacuation of building.
Local ordinances should be researched BEFORE costly security renovations are undertaken.
Windows are common points of entry for criminals, regardless of their height from the ground.
Burglars can open unlocked windows, break glass and unlock locked windows, saw through metal or wooden frames, or pry entire window frames from exterior walls.
5.
Heavy shrubs and vines should be kept low to the ground to reduce their potential to conceal criminals or incendiary or explosive devices.
Large trees or vines should be removed to prevent criminals from climbing to upper windows, large vents, or onto the roof.
6.
Participate in formal Neighborhood Watch type programs organized by local authorities.
7.
Meet with your neighbors and security personnel assigned to your neighboring businesses.
Explain your situation and ask them to keep an eye on your church.
8.
Educate personnel on methods to deal with telephoned threats and conducting bomb searches.
Develop a written protocol for threats and keep it posted.
9.
Document any strange or threatening phone calls.
Talk with the phone company about tracing your lines or installing Caller ID to identify your callers if you are receiv-ing threats.
10.
If a suspicious package or letter is received, immediately call your local police or sheriff's department.
Do not touch or manipulate the object in any manner.
Be alert for letters or packages that display an excessive amount of postage, contain grease stains, or have unfamiliar or missing return addresses.
(See the "SUSPECT LETTER AND PACKAGE INDICATORS " page) 11.
Keep the handling of threatening correspondence, once identified, to an absolute minimum.
Place envelopes, letters or the packages in clear plastic bags and do not compress the bag.
Store them in another location until they can be turned over to law enforcement.
12.
On a rotating basis, have a member of the congregation, who is at least 18 years of age, check on the church daily.
Evaluate the need for a security guard for nights and weekends.
13.
Obtain as detailed a physical description as possible of any suspicious person(s) noticed in or around your facility, including a description of vehicles and license numbers.
(Refer to enclosed worksheet, "Suspect Description") 14.
Duplicate all documents, computer disks, and records that are stored at the church.
Complete a comprehensive inventory of all furniture and equipment, to include serial numbers and value.
Evaluate insurance coverage frequently.
15.
Remove all potential fire hazards from the church grounds, such as trash, lawn clippings and debris.
Store all combustible materials in a locked room, shed, etc.
CAUTIONARY NOTES: A. DO NOT allow watch persons to sleep inside the church B.
The carrying of firearms, nightsticks, mace, or any type of weapon while conducting surveillance or participating in church watch programs should not be permitted.
C. DO NOT approach a suspicious person, challenge anyone, or otherwise place yourself in jeopardy.
If a suspicious situation is found, report it to the nearest law enforcement agency.
Take detailed, legible notes of the activity, which may be used later for court or police purposes.
D. DO NOT pursue vehicle or suspects.
E. Remember, you do not possess police powers and you are liable as an individual for civil and criminal charges should you exceed your authority.
The key is to OBSERVE and REPORT.
F. DO NOT allow anyone to check on the church after having consumed alcohol.
Do not allow anyone to stand watch and consume alcohol.
G.
If possible, conduct the watch patrol in pairs.
H. Conduct watches in a random fashion and not in an observable pattern.
OTHER CRIMES AGAINST CHURCHES It is a crime if your place of worship is defaced or vandalized.
Also, should any of the members of your congregation be threatened or intimidated by an individual or group obstructing their free exercise of religious beliefs, immediately contact local law enforce-ment authorities and the nearest FBI office.
All of the above incidents are serious matters which the FBI can and will investigate under Federal Civil Rights Statutes.
CONCLUSION Please realize that a perfect security system does not exist and that some of these recommendations may or may not be practical for a place of worship.
However, these suggestions can reduce the potential for an arson, bombing, vandalism or burglary at your church.
Many of the listed security measures are quite expensive and may be be-yond the means of many churches.
Local police crime prevention sections are excellent sources for security evaluations and suggestions.
Also, local fire departments can pro-vide on-site fire safety and arson prevention inspections.
They will assist you in prioritiz-ing your needs within your budget constraints.
We realize these recommendations are not all inclusive.
We welcome your ideas for improving this assessment and also the descriptions of any measures you have taken, not contained within this guide, that should be shared with other congregations.
Please contact the Task Force through our Toll Free number, 1-888-ATF-FIRE, to provide this information.
Through the Clearinghouse for Arson Prevention Resources, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is making available an assortment of arson prevention brochures and pamphlets.
Technical assistance on the development of arson watch teams is also available.
Requests for arson prevention workshops, as well as for on-site safety inspections of houses of worship can be made through the Clearinghouse.
If you are interested in arson prevention information, please contact the Clearinghouse toll-free by dialing 1-888-603-3100.
FEMA has also added a special section to its World Wide Web site (http://www.fema.gov) in support of the National Arson Prevention Initiative.
