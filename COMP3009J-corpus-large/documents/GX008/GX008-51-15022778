Shorter Deployments Good News for 49th Combat Support Command
Retention and Recruiting, loss of civilian income factor in decision Army to Limit National Guard and Reserve Deployments to Six Months
The Army has decided to limit overseas deployments of National Guard and Reserve units in peacekeeping and other military operations to a maximum of six months in response to growing concern by civilian employers and families, according to the New York Times.
The decision comes as the California Army National Guard continues to restructure and prepare its units to replace active duty units more frequently.
The California National Guard has already deployed nearly 10 Army and Air Guard units to support peace keeping and contingency missions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Northern Iraq.
The 69th Press Camp Headquarters,100th Troop Command, is currently serving in Bosnia and is expected to return May 5.
Because of the frequent deployments the California Army National Guard created the 49th Combat Support Command to support the Army's increasing reliance upon California National Guard units.
The new command is preparing to meet the challenge of filling the Army's short falls while at the same time continuing to su port the state emergencies.
The California National Guard supports more state emergencies than any other National Guard in the Nation.
The new limit will ease the strain that a rising number of calls to active duty will have have on the 49th and other major commands in the California National Guard especially, their employers.
The new limit is the first significant step by the Army to recognize that its greater reliance on the Guard and Reserve has so intensified the burden on its citizen-soldiers that it threatens to undermine the willingness to join or stay in those units, according to the report.
The 40th Infantry Division found in a survey it conducted in May of 1998 that its soldiers stand to lose between 16 and 65 percent of their household income when deployed on active duty.
They also discovered that the deployments have a rippling impact on the California economy when soldiers are deployed.
Cal Guardsmen spend millions of their drill income on entertainment, traveling, purchasing new cars, homes, investments, and savings.
Those expenditures cease when the soldier is deployed for any length of time.
With the tempo of peacekeeping operations having increased through the 1990's, the Army's leaders say they now have no choice but to turn even more to the 564,000 members of its Guard and Reserve to ease the burden on its active force of 479,000, according to the New York Times.
The Army's decision to shorten rotations for its Guard and Reserve units applies only to operations other than war.
In the event of a conflict, the Army will still be able to mobilize its Guard and Reserve units and send them overseas for the 270 days allowed by law.
The policy brings the Army closer in line to the other services, the New York Times reported.
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units, for example, generally deploy no more than three months.

The Army's announcement of shorter deployments is especially good news for the soldiers of the California National Guard's newest command.
The 49th Command Support Command officially came into existence Feb. 5, 2000 at the Double Tree Inn in Sacramento.
The Army authorized the Command in direct response to their increasing reliance upon the National Guard and Reserves to support their Worldwide Peacekeeping and contingency missions.
Commanded by Brig. Gen. James P. Combs, the new command's primary mission is to prepare units to replace fatigued and overtaxed Active Duty units from missions in the Balkans as well as the Ukraine.
The new command is comprised of 1106th AVCRAD, 100th and 115th Troop commands.
The Army saw the need to consolidate these com-mands under the direction of a general officer staff because they were already activating units from these commands on a regular basis.
The 115th is a regular player with Ukraine in its annual Peace Shield exercises and soldier exchange programs.
The 100th currently has its 69th Press Camp Headquarters deployed to Bosnia, and has detached the 649th Military Police Company to Germany in support of the Balkan exercise and its 19th Special Forces Group to Haiti in recent years.
The AVCRAD had detached units to Hungary in support of the Bosnia mission and preparing for several annual trainings around the world.
Simply stated, these units needed the horsepower of one general officer who could oversee their welfare and create the infrastructure to sustain their support base of family, bosses, and friends.
"Although we are testing and receiving some of the Army's most modern equipment, our most valuable asset remains the soldier who must operate them," said 49th CSC Command Sgt. Maj. Sally Donahe.
"We intend to monitor our soldiers military skills and streamline the infrastructure to care for their families and communicate with their civilian employers."
Combs explained that units in the 49th would most likely deploy more frequently.
The command's main job, he said, is "soldier care" and that that involves caring for the entire spectrum of the soldier's life.
The commander said soldier care is critical if the command is to fulfill its mission to provide company and battalion size units ready to replace regular Army units currently performing peacekeeping and contingency missions around the world.
"This Army's mission is expanding and the level of dependency on Reserve components is increasing," Combs said.
"Our first priority, therefore, must be soldier care.
My number one mandate is improving the number of soldiers assigned to the command and meeting individual soldiers'needs."
The 49th has a full-spectrum of equipment, Combs said, including distinctive organizations such as the MPs (Military Police), Ordinance, Transportation, Military Intelligence, Aviation, personnel, finance, special forces and Civil Affairs."
The new command faces challenges to prepare, maintain, and fill voids in the Army's ongoing worldwide missions while at the same time remain ready to support any state emergency.
With these issues mapped out, Combs appointed the two most qualified soldiers in the system to prepare the command, Col. Mike Smith will serve as the 49th Combat Support Command's Chief of Staff and CSM is its Command Sergeant Major.
