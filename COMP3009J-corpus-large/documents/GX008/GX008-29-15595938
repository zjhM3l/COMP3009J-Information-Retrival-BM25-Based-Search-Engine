News from Senator John Edwards WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE BILL FILED BY SENATOR EDWARDS April 22, 2002 WASHINGTON-
Senator John Edwards has introduced two bills to improve care for women who are victims of sexual or domestic violence.
Cosponsored by Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the Women in Trauma Act would focus new federal efforts on improving mental health and substance abuse services for women affected by trauma.
The measure also would support research into new treatments for trauma-related mental health and substance abuse problems.
Researchers have concluded that as many as 70 percent of women hospitalized for psychiatric disorders have a history of trauma.
Moreover, about nine in 10 homeless women with mental illness have experienced severe physical or sexual abuse as children or adults.
The majority of women suffering from substance abuse and mental health disorders have been victims of rape, incest, physical abuse or some other trauma.
A companion measure also offered by Senators Edwards and Murray would provide funding for mental health and substance abuse counselors at battered women's shelters and other community-based service providers who serve victims of domestic and sexual violence.
Shelters for battered women often are the only place that victims of sexual or domestic violence get help.
The Counseling in Shelters Act would provide federal funding to enable shelters and other community-based providers to hire trained mental health and substance abuse counselors to help victims of domestic or sexual violence begin to deal with the trauma.
The bill complements the Women in Trauma Act by ensuring that shelter counselors refer women who need more intensive therapy to appropriate providers.
The bills are supported by the National Mental Health Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the Domestic Violence Prevention Fund.
