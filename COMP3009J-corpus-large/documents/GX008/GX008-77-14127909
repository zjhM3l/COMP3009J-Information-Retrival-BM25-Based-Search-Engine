You communicated your question just fine.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to communicate an answer as easily.
The number of primes and their distribution, is not known.
"Best guess" is that the number of primes is infinite, but to my knowledge no such theorem has been proven.
Not for having tried by a lot of mathematicians! There are various "sieves" for primes.
These are formulas for "catching" prime numbers.
Mersenne primes are an example of one such sieve.
The famous mathematician, Gauss, presented a formula for estimating the number of primes, p(n), less than an integer, n: p(n)= n/ln(n) for large n.
But there are many other such estimates, too.
There is a great deal of interest in primes because they are used in cryptography -- the study of secret messages.
Many computer hours have been spent examining whether there is any discernable pattern or frequency distribution.
I do not believe that a pattern has been extracted from the vast number of known primes.
