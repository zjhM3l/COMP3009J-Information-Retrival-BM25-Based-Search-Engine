Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Animal behavior; Sounds; Acoustic properties; Physical activity Abstract: The hypothesis that short, rapidly repeated rising notes increase motor activity levels in canids, and that longer, continuous descending notes decrease activity was tested.
Young laboratory-raised domestic dogs were trained in a repeated measures study to (1) come to the trainer and to (2) sit and stay for 2 s to two different acoustic stimuli: four short notes with a rising fundamental frequency and one long note with a descending fundamental frequency.
While one long note was not more effective at eliciting a sit/stay response, four short notes were more effective at eliciting a come response and increasing motor activity levels than one longer continuous note.
Thus, acoustic stimuli are not equipotent in eliciting responses that require changes in motor activity levels and could be used by signal senders to influence the behaviour of the signal receiver.
The acoustic structures in the study are compared with vocalizations of mammals and birds that elicit approach, and/or increase motor activity levels.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Pethidine; Analgesics; Anesthesia; Halothane; Methoxyflurane; Pain; Drug effects; Blood pressure; Pulse rate Abstract: This study was designed to test analgesia, duration, and cardiovascular changes induced by meperidine (MEP) and oxymorphone (OXY) following methoxyflurane (MOF) and halothane (HAL) anesthesia.
Eight healthy dogs were given atropine and acepromazine, and anesthesia was induced with thiamylal and maintained with 1.5 minimal alveolar concentration of MOF or HAL for 1 hour during controlled ventilation.
Eight treatments were given with each anesthetic: 3 with MEP (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg, IV), 3 with oxymorphone (OXY; 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg, IV), and 2 placebos with sterile water.
Test drugs were given at the end of anesthesia when early signs of recovery were evident.
Minimal threshold stimulus/response nociception was assessed by use of an inflatable soft plastic colonic balloon.
Blood pressures and pulse rate were measured with a noninvasive monitor.
Meperidine and OXY were found to be effective analgesics and could be reversed with naloxone.
Intravenous administration of 2.0 mg of MEP/kg provided analgesia for 36 +/- 6 minutes and 39 +/- 15 minutes after MOF and HAL, respectively.
In contrast, OXY was effective at all 3 doses with effects of IV administration of 0.2 mg of OXY/kg lasting 154 +/- 13 minutes and 152 +/- 12 minutes, after MOF and HAL, respectively.
Analgesia could not be demonstrated after anesthesia for acepromazine, MOF, or HAL.
Blood pressure was not changed by either anesthetic nor was it influenced by MEP or OXY.
Pulse rate was significantly depressed by the higher doses of OXY following HAL, but was not changed by MEP following either anesthetic.
This study demonstrated the longer duration of analgesia of OXY.
In addition, we could not find that analgesia was provided by either MOF or HAL following recovery from anesthesia.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Distemper virus; Histopathology; Smell; Olfactory organs Abstract: The sense of smell in dogs infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) was examined by use of EEG olfactometry, behavioral olfactometry, and electro-olfactography.
Infection with CDV was confirmed by a direct immunofluorescence technique in 8 active cases and was suggested by clinical history compatible with canine distemper 10 to 26 weeks earlier in 6 cases.
Pathologic alterations of the olfactory mucosa in 3 clinically affected dogs was examined by light microscopy.
Infection with CDV was found to be associated with anosmia and lack of recorded responses on electro-olfactogram in 8 of 8 dogs with clinical signs of acute distemper from naturally acquired infections.
Anosmia was found in 5 of 6 dogs that had recovered from acute distemper 10 to 26 weeks earlier.
The sixth dog had hyposmia, with abnormalities on the electro-olfactogram.
Histologic examination was not performed on the 6 dogs that had recovered.
Histologic lesions observed at necropsy in 3 dogs that had had clinical signs of acute distemper were those of subacute purulent rhinitis and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium.
Altered olfactory function could be explained by mucopurulent exudate blocking odors from olfactory receptors in the acutely affected dogs, but alteration of olfactory function in the dogs that had recovered without clinical evidence of rhinitis could not be explained.

Includes references.
Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Streptococcus; Pathogens; Saliva; Antibacterial properties; Maternal behavior; Grooming; Wounds Abstract: Canine saliva was tested for its bactericidal effects against pathogens relevant to the presumed hygienic functions of maternal grooming of the mammary and anogenital areas and licking of wounds.
Both female and male saliva were bactericidal against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus canis but only slightly, and nonsignificantly, bactericidal against coagulase positive staphylococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
E. coli is the cause of highly fatal coliform enteritis of neonatal mammals and E. coli and S. canis are the main pathogens implicated in neonatal septicemia of dogs.
The bactericidal effects of saliva would facilitate the hygienic function of maternal licking of the mammary and anogenital areas in protecting newborns from these diseases.
E. coli and S. canis along with coagulase positive staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa are among the common wound contaminants of dogs.
Wound licking, and the application of saliva, would thus reduce wound contamination by E. coli and S. canis.
The resistance of staphylococcus to bactericidal effects of saliva may be a factor in the high frequency (46 percent) with which coagulase positive staphylococcus was isolated from wounds compared with much lower frequency (9-17 percent) with which E. coli and S. canis were isolated.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Distemper virus; Demyelination; Macrophages; Infection; Phagocytosis; Immune response; In vitro Abstract: Inflammatory demyelination in canine distemper has been proposed to be due to a "bystander" mechanism, in which macrophages play an important role.
In the present work we studied whether infection of macrophages by canine distemper virus (CDV) results in changes of macrophage functions, including Fc receptor-dependent and -independent phagocytosis, release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and procoagulant activity (PCA).
As a source of macrophages, dog bone marrow cells were seeded in teflon bags and grown for 1-2 weeks, at which time a marked enrichment of macrophages was noted.
These cells were infected with the A75/17 strain of CDV.
We could not detect any significant difference between uninfected and CDV-infected macrophages with respect to Fc receptor-dependent or -independent phagocytosis or with respect to the release of ROS.
However, from Day 4 p.i. to the end of our observation period (10 days p.i.), PCA was up to 10-fold higher in CDV-infected unstimulated macrophage cultures than in uninfected unstimulated cultures of the same age.
Increase in PCA was not due to the inoculation procedure by itself nor to components of the inoculum other than CDV; in particular, PCA was not due to contaminating endotoxin.
Thus, several important macrophage functions do not appear to be impaired by CDV infection.
The marked increase of macrophage PCA expression suggests that certain macrophage functions may even be enhanced as a result of infection.
Such macrophage activation might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.

New ideas about environmental control, pen design, feeding regimes, husbandry and staff training have been introduced and evaluated.
The success of each change cannot easily be proved as improvements in puppy health depend upon so many factors.
However as a result of a complete care and welfare programme there have been fewer health problems and lower pre-weaning loss, in our colony.

Language: English Descriptors: Louisiana; Dogs; Trypanosoma cruzi; Trypanosomiasis; Strain differences; Age; Infectivity; Acute course; Chronic course; Symptoms; Pathology; Didelphidae; Dasypodidae Abstract: Nineteen purebred Beagles of various ages (4, 5, 13,and 47 weeks) were inoculated with North American Trypanosoma cruzi isolates obtained from an opossum (Tc-O), armadillo (Tc-A), or a dog (Tc-D).
Dogs were grouped on the basis of clinical outcome of infection.
During the acute stage of disease, dogs of group 1 (n = 7 inoculated with Tc-O or Tc-A) died or were euthanatized because of the severity of disease.
Dogs of group 2 (n = 5 inoculated with Tc-O or Tc-A) developed acute disease, but survived to develop chronic disease.
Dogs of group 3 (n = 7Tc-D-inoculated dogs) developed neither acute nor chronic disease.
Dogs of group 4 (n = 4-2 dogs 13 weeks old and 2 dogs 47 weeks old) served as noninoculated controls.
Clinical signs associated with severe acute myocarditis developed in dogs of groups 1 and 2 between postinoculation day (PID) 15 and 28.
Generalized lymphadenopathy and lymphocytosis were observed in all dogs of groups 1, 2, and 3 between PID 14 and 17.
Serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities and urea nitrogen concentration were high, and glucose concentration was low prior to death of dogs in group 1.
Serum activities of isoenzymes of creatine kinase were significantly (P 
Parasitemia was detected by examination of thick blood smears as early as PID 3, peaked by PID 17 in most dogs, and was not detected by PID 33 in dogs of groups 1 and 2.
Parasitemia was documented by blood culture results in dogs of groups 2 and 3 at various times throughout the study.
Dogs infected at an older age generally had lesser degree of parasitemia and higher survival rate than did dogs infected at a younger age.
Dogs of group 2 did not manifest clinical signs of disease for 27 to 120 days prior to onset of chronic disease.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Glycosidases; Mucopolysaccharidosis; Structural genes; Cloning; Nucleotide sequences; Amino acid sequences Abstract: alpha-L-Iduronidase is a lysosomal enzyme, the deficiency of which causes mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I); a canine MPS I colony has been bred to test therapeutic intervention.
The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from canine testis and found to consist of two electrophoretically separable proteins that had common internal peptides but differed at their amino termini.
A 57-base oligonucleotide, corresponding to the most probable codons of the longest peptide, was used to screen a canine testis cDNA library.
Three cDNAs were isolated, two of which lacked the 5' -end whereas the third was full-length except for a small internal deletion.
The composite sequence encodes an open reading frame of 655 amino acids that includes all sequenced peptides.
The amino terminus of the larger protein, glutamic acid 26, is at the predicted signal peptide cleavage site, whereas the amino terminus of the smaller protein is leucine 106.
There are six potential N-glycosylation sites and a non-canonical polyadenylation signal, CTTAAA.
A search of Gen-Bank showed that the amino acid sequence of alpha-L-iduronidase has similarity to that of a bacterial beta-xylosidase.
A full-length cDNA corresponding to the composite sequence was constructed (pcIdu) and inserted into the pSVL expression vector (pSVcIdu).
Two days after Cos-1 cells were transfected with pSVcIdu, their intracellular and secreted level of alpha-L-iduronidase activity had increased 8- and 22-fold, respectively, over the endogenous activity.
Fibroblasts of MPS I dogs, which have no alpha-L-iduronidase activity, lacked the normal alpha-L-iduronidase mRNA of 2.2 kilobases and contained instead a trace amount of a 2.8-kilobase species.
Isolation and characterization of an expressible alpha-L-iduronidase cDNA represents the first step toward mutation analysis and replacement therapy.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Stress Abstract: It is increasingly important to have simple, noninvasive indicators of stress in animals.
Studies in various species have shown that concentrations of cortisol in saliva relate closely to plasma levels of the free hormone; the aim of the present procedure was to show a similar correlation in the dog.
Baseline blood and saliva samples were collected concurrently from six male beagles.
Synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone was given and further samples were collected at 0.25, 0.5, one, two and 2.5 hours later.
The results indicated a statistically significant correlation between the levels of cortisol in blood and saliva.
Concentrations in saliva were between 5 and 10 per cent of those in plasma at each collection time.
To demonstrate a response to a more natural stimulus, saliva samples were taken from a dog during exposure to a known stressor for that individual.
The results showed a marked, delayed increase from baseline which was maintained for at least 0.5 hours after stressing.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Histamine; Morphine; Analgesics; Intravenous feeding; Animal behavior Abstract: Cardiovascular effects (vasodilatation, hypotension) of morphine administration have been attributed to central actions and peripheral histamine release.
In the study reported here, we compared plasma histamine (Hm) concentrations after morphine sulfate and oxymorphone HCl administration in conscious dogs.
Five healthy adult dogs (mean body weight, 10.1 kg) were randomly administered morphine (2 mg/kg of body weight, IV or oxymorphone (0.2 mg/kg, IV) by a 5-second bolus injection at weekly intervals.
Venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected from jugular veins before and at 1, 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after drug administration.
Behavioral changes were recorded.
Plasma was analyzed by a radioenzymatic technique, using purified histamine N-methyltransferase as an enzyme catalyst (sensitivity of assay, 40 pg Hm/ml).
Mean base-line Hm value for all dogs was 0.55 ng/ml.
The mean Hm value was significantly higher (P

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Osteochondritis; Dietary surveys; Caloric intake; Nutrients; Exercise; Sex; Age; Calcium; Protein intake; Dog foods; Dog breeds; Comparisons Abstract: A matched case-control study was conducted to evaluate dietary components and exercise patterns as potential risk factors for osteochondritis dissecans in dogs.
A telephone interview, with a standard questionnaire and protocol, was used to collect data on dietary intake of calories and nutrients and on the usual amounts and types of exercise of each dog.
Thirty-one dogs with osteochondritis dissecans and 60 controls were matched on the basis of breed, sex, and age.
Using a conditional logistic regression model, high dietary calcium, playing with other dogs, and drinking well water (rather than city water) were associated with increased risk of osteochondritis dissecans.
Feeding of specialty dry dog foods was associated with decreased risk.

Phenylhydrazine was used to induce a transient, severe, hemolytic anemia in dogs to evaluate the effects of CPV infection on rapidly dividing bone marrow precursors.
Erythrocyte colony-forming unit bone marrow cultures and cytologic examination of bone marrow were used to determine the effects of CPV infection on erythroid bone marrow precursors.
The induced hemolytic anemia regenerated rapidly and although the bone marrow was infected, it was determined that CPV infection did not induce a detectable decrease in erythroid progenitors in dogs with severe hemolytic anemia.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Renal failure; Bone marrow; Cell culture; Blood serum; Erythropoietin Abstract: Serum from dogs with surgically induced renal impairment was incorporated into the medium for erythroid bone marrow cultures.
A significant correlation was found between serum activities of erythropoietin and numbers of erythroid colony-forming units grown in culture.
Serum creatinine concentrations had no correlation, and serum parathyroid hormone activities had a negative correlation with numbers of erythroid colony-forming units that was below the level of significance.
Purified 1-84 parathyroid hormone added to bone marrow cultures was found to be stimulatory to erythroid colony-forming unit growth in higher concentrations, but decreased the number of burst-forming units.
Unmeasured substances in the canine serum appeared to have a greater effect on the canine erythroid bone marrow cultures than did creatinine or parathyroid hormone values.

Language: English Descriptors: U.S.A.; Dogs; Animal housing; Cage size; Cage density; Exercise; Animal welfare; Regulations Abstract: One of the requirements of the 1985 amendments to the Animal Welfare Act is the establishment of an exercise program for dogs.
Assumptions have been made by some that larger cages or the presence of a companion animal will motivate exercise.
To examine how cage size, pair housing and human contact affect exercise, a study was conducted using a computerized video-data acquisition system that measured distance traveled and time spent moving in 1 X 1 m, (single only) and 1 X 2 m (single and paired) and 1 X 1.5 m cage (paired only) cages.
Male beagle dogs (n = 6) housed singly in the 1 m2 cage traveled an average of 55m/hr spending only 8% (57 min) of the 12 h photo period in motion.
When the cage size was doubled, the average distance traveled decreased to 13m/hr and the time spent moving increased to 11% (77 min/day).
When dogs were pair housed in a regulation size cage, the average distance traveled decreased to 8.6 m/hr and they spent less than 6% of the day in exercising (42 min/12hrs.).
The greatest amount of exercise was seen when dogs were housed as a pair in a cage less than recommended size (an average of 109 m/hr and 8.8 min/hr).
Therefore, these data indicate that larger cages or pair housing in regulation size cages have little or no effect on the activity of purpose bred male beagle dogs.
There was, however, a direct correlation between activity, time and distance, and the presence of humans in the animal room.
When people were in the room, dog activity increased.
When people were absent, dogs were less active.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Corticotropin; Blood plasma; Radioimmunoassay; Sample processing; Frozen storage; Duration; Temperature; Edta; Heparin; Trypsin inhibitors; Tubes Abstract: A commercially available radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit for measurement of human adrenocorticotropin (hACTH) was validated for use in dogs.
Assay sensitivity was 3 pg/ml.
Intra-assay coefficient of variation (X 100; CV) for 3 canine plasma pools was 3.0 (mean +/- SD, 33 +/- 0.99 pg/ml), 4.2 (71 +/-2.4 pg/ml) and 3.7 (145 +/- 3.7 pg/ml) %.
Interassay CV for 2 plasma pools measured in 6 assays was 9.8 (37 +/- 3.6 pg/ml) and 4.4 (76 +/- 3.4 pg/ml) %, respectively.
Dilutional parallelism was documented by assaying 2 pools of canine plasma at 3 dilutions and correcting the measured result for dilution.
Corrected mean concentrations for the first pool were 33 (+/- 0.99), 36 (+/- 4.3), and 33 (+/- 6.8) pg/ml; corrected mean concentrations for the second pool were 145 (+/- 5.4), 141 (+/- 10.8) and 125 (+/- 3.4) pg/ml.
Recovery of 1-39hACTH added to canine plasma (6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, and 100.0 pg/ml) was linear and quantitative (slope = 0.890, R2 = 0.961).
To test whether anticoagulant or the protease inhibitor, aprotinin, influences ACTH concentration in canine plasma, ACTH was measured in canine blood collected in 4 tubes containing anticoagulant: heparin (H), heparin + 500 kallikrein inhibitor units (KIU) of aprotinin/ml (HA), EDTA (E), and EDTA + aprotinin (EA).
Plasma ACTH concentration was the same when samples containing H and HA, or HA and E were compared, and was significantly (P

Synthetic 1-39hACTH added to canine blood was accurately recovered (88 to 109%, n = 3) from plasma containing EDTA, with or without aprotinin, whereas percentage recovery was overestimated by 18 to 91% in heparinized plasma.

Oxymorphone plus acepromazine, xylazine alone, atropine plus xylazine, and diazepam plus ketamine were compared for interference with the detrusor reflex, adequacy of patient restraint, and development of adverse side effects.
Atropine plus xylazine was the best of the 4 drug combinations tested, because it had the least interference with the detrusor reflex, bradycardia did not develop, and excellent restraint was obtained.
Pain and hematuria were common whenever intravesicular pressure exceeded 40 cm of H2O, yet pressures that high were rarely necessary to stimulate the detrusor reflex.

At 30 days after SC inoculation of dogs with infective Dirofilaria immitis larvae, all ivermectin formulations were given orally at dosage of 6 microgram/kg of body weight.
The ivermectin chewable tablets also were given orally at dosage of 2 and 6 microgram/kg at 30 and 45 days, respectively, after injection of larvae.
Replicates of 6 or 8 dogs in each study were formed on the basis of gender and body weight and, within replicates, were randomly allocated to treatment groups.
At 30 days after injection of larvae, the additional dogs (in replicates of 8) were assigned to the control group and to the group given ivermectin chewable tablets at dosage of 6 microgram/kg.
All dogs were housed individually.
Necropsy was performed approximately 5 or 6 months after larvae were administered.
In both trials, all control dogs had heartworms at necropsy (University of Illinois-geometric mean, 35.0; Florida-geometric mean, 26.1).
In both trials, the ivermectin chewable tablet (6 microgram/kg) and both tablet formulations (6 microgram/kg) given at 30 days after larval injection, and the chewable formulation (6 microgram/kg) given at 45 days after larval injection were 100% effective (P

Language: English Descriptors: Canidae; Distemper virus; Cell lines; Rna; Infection; Heat shock proteins; Stress response; Cytopathogenicity; Transcription; Protein synthesis; Phenotypes Abstract: Previous in vitro work demonstrated the incorporation of the major inducible 70k heat shock protein (i.e., 72k HSP) into the biologically active light nucleocapsid (L-NC) variant of canine distemper virus (CDV).
Here, in vitro induction of the cellular stress response, characterized by elevated cytoplasmic and intranuclear 72k HSP, enhanced L-NC expression in mink lung cells supporting stable persistent infection by raccoon-origin CDV.
Increases in L-NC were correlated to increased viral RNA production in cell-free transcriptional assays.
The enhanced production of viral transcripts within infected cells following stress response induction was confirmed by slot blot and Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA and was reflected in increased total viral protein production.
Post-shock increases in viral fusion (F) gene transcripts and F protein were associated with dramatic increases in viral cytopathic effect.
Modest induction of cell-free infectious viral progeny was also documented.
A similar effect of the cellular stress response upon viral protein expression, cytopathic effect, and cell-free infectious progeny release was demonstrated in murine neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with a canine CDV isolate.
Alterations of the persistent viral phenotype were independent of the specific mechanism of stress-response induction (i.e., heat or sodium arsenite), supporting the role of the stress response and not a particular stressor in mediating these changes.
These results document the ability of the cellular environment to alter persistent viral RNA metabolism, thereby altering the infection phenotype.

Thirteen mature mongrel female dogs were divided into two groups, the first group was treated for estrus induction during late anestrus and the second group during mid-anestrus.
The dogs were monitored by teasing, vaginal cytology, and hormonal assay during the induced (n = 13) and the previous spontaneous estrous cycle (n = 9).
Six of eight and three of five bitches came into standing estrus in the first and second group, respectively.
Of the bitches that came into estrus, three conceived in the first group and one in the second.
The average induced litter size was 7.0 versus 7.5 for the colony.
Based on vaginal cytology the induced proestrus and estrus lasted 1.7 (0 to 3) and 12.9 (4 to 24) d, respectively, while the spontaneous proestrus and estrus lasted 5.8 (0-17) and 12.8 (9-15) d, respectively.
Progesterone profiles were similar between the induced and spontaneous estrous cycles, although the progesterone peak was higher during the spontaneous cycle.
The preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge was observed in only one induced estrous cycle.
Modest results were obtained with this therapy.
However, the litter sizes were normal and the induced cycles were very similar to the physiologic ones.
No side effects were seen with the oral form of DES.

Language: English Descriptors: Angelica archangelica; Roots; Neuroleptics; Dogs; Cats; Hamsters; Rats; Screening; Central nervous system; Effects Abstract: Xanthotoxol (XT), 8-hydroxypsoralen, exhibited dose-graded sedative activity in dogs, cats, rats, mice and hamsters.
At doses of 5-20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) in cats and 3-100 mg/kg orally (p.o.) in dogs, XT blocked predatory mouse/rat killing behavior.
In mice, XT (10-300 mg/kg i.p.) exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in locomotor activity but was less potent in this regard than reference diazepam (10-100 mg/kg i.p.).
XT in mice (0.1-10.0 mg/kg i.p.) and in hamsters (0.1-10.0 mg/kg p.o.) antagonized amphetamine-induced hypermobility but was less potent than diazepam.
XT elevated the electrical threshold in foot-shock-induced fighting behavior in rats.
XT (0.1-30.0 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated pentobarbital-induced narcosis in hamsters at otherwise subeffective doses of pentobarbital.
Conditioned avoidance responses in rats were not significantly altered with 1-3 mg/kg i.p. and 30-100 mg/kg p.o. doses of XT but 300 mg/kg p.o. blocked both conditioned and unconditioned response.
Doses of 100-1000 mg/kg i.p. of XT in mice were used to study 48-h acute toxicity of XT and its LD50 was estimated to be 468 mg/kg.
Doses of 10, 40 and 80 mg/kg p.o. were used to study the chronic toxicity of XT in rats for 6 months and no side effects or abnormalities in reproductive activity or endocrine integrity were noted.
The F1 generation of rats from 6-month XT-treated parents were free of teratogenic effects.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Genetic defects; Genetic markers; Immunopathology; Major histocompatibility complex; Sleep Abstract: Identification of genes determining narcolepsy susceptibility is important not only for understanding that disorder but also for possible clues to general sleep-control mechanisms.
Studies in humans reveal at least one such gene related to the major histocompatibility complex and in dog an as-yet-unmapped single, autosomal recessive gene canarc-1.
Gene markers for canarc-1 were therefore sought by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms in our colony of narcoleptic dogs.
A human micro-switch immunoglobulin probe and the enzyme Hae III identified a gene cosegregating with canarc-1 in backcrossed animals (logarithm of odds scores: m = 24, Z max = 7.2 at theta = 0%). canarc-1 was also shown not to be tightly linked with the dog major histocompatibility complex (m = 40, Z 
These results represent the mapping of a non-major histocompatibility complex narcolepsy gene and strongly suggest involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of that disease.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Exercise; Hematology; Biochemistry; Blood; Gases; Acid base equilibrium Abstract: After racing 722 m, 16 Greyhounds were evaluated to determine changes in hematologic, biochemical, blood-gas, and acid-base values following exercise.
Values were determined before racing (T(0)), immediately after racing (T(1)), and 3 hours after racing (T(2)).
Significant changes detected immediately after racing included heart rate, respiratory rate, and rectal temperature.
Significant changes in hematologic values included increases in PCV, total plasma protein, hemoglobin, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, and lymphocytes.
Change was not detected in values for monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio.
Other increases included those for plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, calcium, lactic acid, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose.
Concentrations of potassium and urea did not change.
Measurement of blood-gas and acid-base status revealed significant increases in Pao2 and base deficit, whereas Paco2, pH, and bicarbonate decreased.
Three hours after exercise, all vital signs and blood-gas and acid-base values, except for Paco2, which was still slightly, low, had returned to baseline (T(0)) values.
Most biochemical values had also returned to baseline, although sodium, chloride, asparatate transaminase, and creatine kinase were still high, and urea was low.
Many hematologic values were still different from baseline values, with high values for WBC, neutrophils and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and low values for PCV, total plasma protein, hemoglobin, RBC, and lymphocytes.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Hemolytic anemia; Hereditary diseases; Histopathology; Reticulocytes; Reticulocytosis Abstract: Three Beagles with chronic anemia and reticulocytosis were studied.
The dogs originated from a large breeding colony and appeared clinically normal with the exception of splenomegaly.
The PCV ranged from 30 to 39% (normal, 46 to 56%), with reticulocyte indices of 2.3 to 9.9.
Red blood cells were morphologically normal, and examination of marrow aspirates revealed erythroid hyperplasia.
Shortened chromium-51 RBC life-spans (7.2 to 15.4 days in anemic dogs; 22.2 to 25.2 days in control dogs) documented a hemolytic anemia.
Acquired causes of hemolytic anemia were ruled out.
Red blood cells had normal glycolytic enzyme activities, no evidence of unstable or abnormal hemoglobin, and had altered osmotic fragility curves.
The breeding of 2 anemic dogs resulted in off-spring with anemia and reticulocytosis.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed no abnormalities in RBC membrane cytoskeletal proteins in all anemic adult dogs and in 3 offspring.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Calcinosis; Hypercalcemia; Parathyroid disorders; Parathyroid hormone; Radioimmunoassay; Sampling techniques; Serological diagnosis Abstract: Ten commercially available parathormone (PTH) assays were competitively validated, using dilutional parallelism, intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation, and sensitivity and measured responses of 2 dogs to calcium and EDTA infusions.
A 2-site immunoradiometric assay for intact human-PTH was superior to the others for estimating canine-PTH, met the criteria for validity, and was further investigated.
A series of sample-handling studies was performed.
Serum and plasma samples stored at 24 C lost 15% (n = 5; P less than 0.05) of PTH between 2 and 24 hours.
This did not occur at 6 C.
The mean PTH concentration of sera from blood samples clotted at 24 C was 6% (P less than 0.05) higher than equivalent EDTA samples.
Serum samples stored at 6 and 37 C deteriorated 35% and 100% (n = 5; P less than 0.05), respectively, after 1 week, whereas samples stored at -20 and -70 C for 4 weeks did not deteriorate.
There was no significant deterioration of PTH in samples frozen (-40 C) and thawed up to 7 times (n = 5).
Parathyroid function testing was investigated by use of 2-hour infusions of disodium EDTA (25 mg/kg/h), 10-minute infusions of calcium gluconate (3 mg of elemental calcium/kg/10 min), and physiologic saline controls (n = 8).
Renal function was monitored before and after EDTA infusion by exogenous creatinine clearance.
Infusion of disodium EDTA increased mean PTH concentration from 67 (time 0) to 317 and 235 pg/ml at 90 and 180 minutes, respectively (P less than 0.001).
Infusion of calcium gluconate decreased mean PTH concentration from 84 (time 0) to 14 and 12 pg/ml at 15 and 60 minutes, respectively (P less than 0.005).
There were no observable side effects of the infusions in normal conscious dogs and no differences in exogenous creatinine clearance after EDTA infusion.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Exercise; Physical fitness; Cage size; Kennels; Succinate dehydrogenase; Heart rate Abstract: The effect of various confinement conditions on physical fitness in dogs was evaluated.
Eighteen 9.5- to 10-month-old female purpose-bred Beagles were maintained individually for 3 months at a time in 1 of 6 confinement conditions: Condition A--an outdoor housing area with a conventional dog house and free access to a 6.1 X 9.1-m pen; condition B--outdoor kennel with a conventional dog house and free access to a 1.8 X 6.1-m run; condition C--indoor environmentally controlled 1.2 X 3.66-m run; condition D--0.9 X 1.2 X 0.84-m conventional laboratory cage in an indoor environmentally controlled room; condition E--0.9 X 1.2 X 0.84-m conventional laboratory cage in an indoor environmentally controlled room with treadmill exercise (7 km/h at a 10% grade) for 30 min/d, 5 d/wk; condition F--0.71 X 0.86 X 0.69-m conventional laboratory cage in an indoor environmentally controlled room.
During the final week of each 3-month interval, muscle succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activities and submaximal exercise heart rates (during treadmill exercise) were determined to estimate physical fitness.
Also, 5 days after being moved into a different housing condition, blood samples were collected for plasma cortisol determination.
The type of confinement condition for dogs had little effect on muscle succinate dehydrogenase activity, but had a modest effect on submaximal exercise heart rates of dogs.
At the fifth and tenth minutes of the treadmill exercise period, heart rates of dogs maintained in the smallest cages (condition F) were higher than those of dogs maintained in outside pens and runs (conditions A and B), indicating decreased fitness in the dogs maintained in the smallest cages.
Differences in heart rates were not detected among dogs in other conditions.
The confinement conditions used in this study had no detectable effect on plasma cortisol concentrations.
We concluded that neither cage or pen size nor a regular mandatory exercise program substantially impacted on physical 282 NAL Call.

Language: English Descriptors: Food intake; Appetite control; Feeding behavior; Satiety; Pancreozymin; Glucagon; Dogs Abstract: Feeding responses to continuous intravenous administration of graded doses of the COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8) and pancreatic glucagon, alone and in combination, were determined in dogs fasted 4 h. Low doses of glucagon (50, 500, 5,000, 6,000 pmol.kg-1.h-1) had no effect on food intake, whereas higher doses (12 and 24 nmol.kg-1.h-1) depressed intake by 50-60%.
Of the CCK-8 doses administered (50 and 400 pmol.kg-1.h-1), food intake was depressed only at the higher dose (53%).
This effect was blocked by glucagon (50-5,000 pmol. kg-1.h-1).
Simultaneous administration of 50 or 500 pmol.kg-1.h-1 of glucagon and 50 pmol.kg-1.h-1 of CCK-8, doses currently thought to produce plasma peptide levels similar to those occurring postprandially in dogs, had no effect on food intake.
These results suggest that plasma levels of CCK and glucagon after a meal are not sufficient alone or in combination to produce satiety.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Pups; Anesthesia; Veins; Injections; Chloralose Abstract: Chloralose is an intravenous anesthetic which preserves vagal and central baroreceptor reflexes, thus rendering it useful for physiologic research.
However, chloralose is recommended for terminal experiments only, due to concerns relating to long-term toxicity.
We investigated the safety of chloralose in longitudinal pulmonary function studies in beagle puppies.
Twelve puppies received chloralose anesthesia repeatedly (8-12 times per dog) between the ages of 80 and 300 days.
Constant anesthetic depth was maintained reliably throughout the course of the experiments.
Recovery lasted approximately 4 hours in each experiment and occurred in four definable stages.
Following recovery, the puppies exhibited normal health and growth as compared with other colony animals.
There was no biochemical evidence of acute renal, hepatic, pancreatic or cardiac toxicity prior to and immediately after anesthesia, and no evidence of chronic toxicity following completion of the study protocol, after a total cumulative dose of 1.18 g/kg chloralose.
These studies demonstrate that intravenous chloralose is a safe anesthetic for longitudinal use.

Language: English Descriptors: Training of animals; Acoustics; Animal behavior Abstract: The central question posed by this chapter is whether some physical properties of sound have consistent, species-independent effects on the response of an animal receiver.
Research on professional animal trainers showed that trainers, of many linguistic and geographic backgrounds, used short, rapidly repeated broadband notes to stimulate motor activity and longer, continuous narrow-band notes to inhibit activity.
Controlled tests on laboratory-raised domestic pups supported the hypothesis that short, rapidly repeated notes stimulate motor activity in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris).
These studies are discussed in relation to the use of the same acoustic structures by nonhuman animals, and the hypothesis that some sounds are particularly effective in influencing the internal state and subsequent behavior of the mammals and birds who hear them.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Semen; Prepuce; Aerobes; Microbial flora; Bacteria; Breed differences; Mating; Transmission Abstract: The aerobic bacterial flora of the genital tract was characterized in 15 stud dogs in an 18-month study.
The dogs represented 4 breeds and were from 3 kennels.
Bacterial samples from the prepuce and semen were collected every month, except in connection with matings, when they were collected weekly (464 samples).
The dogs that were included all mated at least once during the study.
The mean pregnancy rate, litter size, and pup mortality for the bitches with which they had mated were all within normal limits.
The most frequent bacteria isolated from the prepuce and semen were Pasteurella multocida, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Escherichia coli.
There was a tendency for breeds to differ in frequency of the most common bacterial species.
Bacterial culture yielded no aerobic growth in 14.2% of the preputial samples and 69.8% of the semen samples.
Bacteria were transferred between dog and bitch at mating.
In this study of healthy breeding dogs, neither the fertility of the dog nor that of the bitch was affected by the bacteria transferred.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Cytochrome b; Cytochrome p-450; Oxidoreductases; Glutathione transferase; Drug metabolism; Enzyme activity; Age differences; Maturation; Sex differences Abstract: A qualitative and quantitative assessment was made of the development of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME) in dogs as part of a study of the ability of animal test species to metabolize drugs.
The following DME variables were measured in this study: amount of cytochromes P-450 and b5; activity of the NADPH and NADH-dependent reductases associated with each of these cytochromes; activity of cytochrome P-450-mediated enzymes, including aniline and coumarin hydroxylases, aminopyrine N-demethylase, and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase; activity of a uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid glucuronyl transferase with 4-methylumbelliferone as substrate; and glutathione-S-transferase activities, with dinitrochlorobenzene and dichloronitrobenzene as substrates.
Most enzyme components had achieved maximal amount or activity by the fifth to eighth week after birth; they tended to decrease after weaning, although the activity of dichloronitrobenzene-glutathione transferase in geriatric dogs (312 to 525 weeks old) was approximately twofold greater than that of 8-week-old pups.
There were no gender-related differences in any of the enzyme amounts or activities determined.
Individual variation was pronounced even in the homogeneous colony from which these dogs were obtained.

Language: English Descriptors: Dogs; Hemolytic anemia; Erythrocytes; Density; Erythrocyte fragility; Osmosis; Swelling Abstract: Red blood cell populations separated by density centrifugation were compared in a dynamic assay of osmotic stress.
Red blood cells from Beagles genotypically normal and nonanemic (nonaffected), Beagles with inherited hemolytic anemia (anemic), and Beagles presumed to be carriers of the anemia trait (trait carriers) were examined for rate and extent of swelling after exposure to the ionophore A23187 in a medium containing calcium and potassium chloride.
Comparisons were made between RBC populations separated on the basis of density.
Significant differences were observed in the rates of cell swelling in Rbc populations separated by density between nonaffected and anemic Beagles.
The response of RBC from Beagles presumed to carry the anemia trait was similar to that of RBC from nonaffected dogs.
One phenotypic expression of this inherited abnormality of Rbc in Beagles was an accelerated rate of RBC swelling under osmotic stress, and this swelling response diminished with increasing RBC density.
