Introduction MMP is a collaborative effort of the Long Point Bird Observatory, Environment Canada and the US Great Lakes Protection Fund.
It has been established to aid the conservation of marsh habitat by establishing baseline assessments of bird and amphibian populations and by monitoring population changes and habitat requirements of marsh birds and amphibians over the long term.
Additional information is available at the official web page of the Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program.
The data collected by volunteers from the US and Canada will be used, in part, to assess the progress and success of marsh rehabilitation efforts, especially those in the 43 Areas of Concern around the Great Lakes.
MMP first began in Canada in 1994
Expanded into US in 1995
CVNP has been a participant in the MMP since 1995
Increased recruitment target areas for AOCs (135 routes in AOC)
MMP's goal is to eventually have all marshes in AOCs monitored and to have at least as many non-AOC routes monitored.
MMP participants in the NE Ohio area: RAP coordinator is Kelvin Rogers, Ohio EPA.
Sites monitored are CVNP, Cleveland Metroparks, Mentor Marsh, Black River RAP area, Geauga County Metroparks and Mogadore Reservoir.

What is a marsh? - a vegetated, wet area; periodically or regularly inundated up to a depth of 6 feet with water.
Standing or slowly moving water; small number of trees and shrubs occur.
Predominantly emergent non-woody plants (cattails, rushes, reeds, grasses, sedges).
Submerged and floating plants occur in open water.
The LPBO MMP is collecting information on calling amphibians in marshes across the Great Lakes basin in an effort to monitor the health of these wetlands.
LPBO has identified five amphibian indicator species.
The greater the diversity and abundance of the following species, the better the habitat: Bullfrog, northern leopard, chorus, mink, spring peeper.
Numbers of amphibians are an important indicator of marsh ecosystem health.
Amphibians are an important part of the ecological balance of many habitats.
They are a measure of the health of the environment
They are studied for biomedical uses.

Survey Results: In the last 2 years, 300 volunteers have participated in the MMP is the Great Lakes Basin.
Basinwide: 307 routes have been monitored in the US/Canada in 1996.
41,766 marsh birds have been recorded in last 2 years
5,502 amphibian choruses recorded in last 2 years
194 species of birds
13 species of amphibians
Overall, fewer species found in AOC marshes than in non-AOC marshes.
Fourteen species of frogs and toads occur across the Great Lakes Basin.
The 10 most common frogs/toads in the Great Lakes basin ( listed from most common to least common):
1.
spring peeper Hyla crucifer
2.
green frog Rana clamitans
3.
American toad Bufo americanus
4.
Gray treefrog Hyla versicolor
5.
northern leopard Rana pipiens
6.
Bullfrog Rana catesbeiana
7.
Chorus frog Pseudacris triseriata
8.
Wood frog Rana sylvatica
9.
Pickerel frog Rana palustris
10.
Mink frog Rana septentrionalis
All of the above frogs, except the mink frog (which is found in the northern Great Lakes area), are found in CVNP.
Eight species of frogs and one toad are found in CVNP.

Methodology Conducting the MMP Survey: (April, May, June) Survey is conducted on three evenings from spring to early summer.
It is limited to easily detected species (frogs and toads) which call during the breeding season.
Night time temperatures for the first survey should be greater than 41F; second survey, greater that 50F; and the third, greater that 63F.
Survey dates should be at least 15 days apart.
Frogs and toads always require an air temperature greater than 41F to elicit calling activity
The first survey is timed to monitor species that breed very early (Chorus frog, Wood Frog and Spring Peeper).
The second survey should coincide with "optimum" breeding for Spring Peeper, American Toad, Northern Leopard Frog, and Pickerel Frog.
The third survey will monitor Gray Treefrog, Green Frog and Bullfrog.
Surveys should begin no earlier than one-half hour after sunset and should finish before midnight.
Each station is surveyed for 3 minutes.
Best weather conditions for surveying are when it is warm, a little wet and fairly calm.
Nights that are damp, hazy, foggy or have a light rain falling are ideal.
Record the number of individuals that you count or estimate are calling by species.

Biology: Frogs and toads relatively sedentary; they are probably more prone to and hence more representative of localized point sources of contamination than other vertebrates.
This makes them more sensitive to the loss and degradation of habitat.
Frogs spend their lives both in water and on land.
Begin as eggs floating on the surface of still waters; develop into tadpoles; change into frogs.
These major changes in form occur under the control of hormones.
Frogs breathe through their skin - perhaps toxic heavy metals and pesticides building up in aquatic food chains, plus air pollution may be killing some frogs.
Northern leopard frog is the most widespread species in North America (frog of choice for dissection in Biology classes); over the past 15 years, the range has dwindled.
Unknown cause for decline.
There are 14 species of toads/frogs in the Great Lakes Basin.
toads - dry, warty skins, execute little jumps/hops.
frogs - moist, smooth skins, make long leaps.
Two species of toads in the Great Lakes basin.
Toads are mainly terrestrial, but make their way to water to breed in the spring.
Song is a long melodious trill lasting 30 seconds.
Frogs (true frogs) family Ranidae; long legged, smooth, toes jointly webbed, but fingers free.
Six species: bullfrog, wood frog, leopard frog (widespread throughout the basin, but declining in recent years); pickerel frog; green frog; mink frog (northern species).
Family Hylidae; are the treefrogs; adapted to live in trees; toe ends have an adhesive disk and they have long limbs and digits to help them cling to twigs and bark.
They change color to match their environment and are often only detected when they call.
Gray tree frog, cricket frog, chorus frog (sings day and night) and spring peeper.

Declining Amphibian Population Task Force (DAPTF) Over the last 50 years, many species of amphibians throughout the world have declined markedly in numbers.
Some species have become extinct.
The declines are often a direct response to the impact of human activities (such as pollution or habitat destruction).
However, towards the late 1980's biologists from many parts of the world reported declines in amphibian populations in apparently pristine habitats, such as national parks and nature reserves, where local effects could not be implicated.
This led to the suggestion that there may be one or more global factors that are adversely affecting amphibians.
Possible causes for declines are:
-an increase in ionizing radiation (UV-B)resulting from ozone layer depletion.
-chemical contamination: the oestrogenic effects of pesticides, acid precipitation, or the effects of fertilizers and herbicides.
-introduction of exotic competitors and predators
- pathogens
- habitat loss or modification due to farming, grazing, logging, roads, urban development, flood control and water development projects.
Frogs breathe through their skin - perhaps toxic heavy metals and pesticides building up in aquatic food chains, plus air pollution may be killing some frogs
Frogs with severe birth defects have been discovered in the past two years in 54 of Minnesota's 87 counties, across Wisconsin, and into the St. Lawrence River Valley in Quebec.
These frogs have missing legs, extra legs, missing eyes.
Deformities are caused by something that affects the frogs in early life (when they are eggs or tadpoles)
In 1997 the MMP will attempt to identify sites in the Great Lakes Basin which contain normal and deformed frogs.
These data will be used to select sites for further study.
Canada's Point Pelee National Park in northern Lake Erie has lost 3 frog species since 1972.

Other Research: Cleveland State University:
The Biology department is conducting a long-term monitoring of changes in amphibian abundance and species richness.
Their goals are to identify and quantify important threats to amphibian populations; investigate the physiological and demographic responses of amphibians to those threats in CVNP.
Three years of survey work have been completed.
Overall species richness has apparently not changed over at least the past 10 years.
Results support a statistically significant 45% average increase in the number of species per site in comparison to an earlier 1983 study.
This increase may be attributable to the intensive sampling made possible by the automated recorder.
However, no significant decrease in species richness has been detected.
