PROGRAM: Ecuador TITLE AND NUMBER: Biodiversity Conserved in Selected Protected Areas and Their Buffer Zones, 518-001 PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: $3,500,000 (DA) PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: $6,096,000 (DA) STATUS: Continuing INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1997 ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: FY 2003
Summary: With only 2% of South America's geographical area, Ecuador contains numerous habitats of globally and regionally outstanding biological value.
This environment, however, is seriously threatened, since Ecuador has the highest population density, the third highest population growth, and one of the lowest per capita GNP incomes in South America.
Ecuador suffers the highest rate of deforestation among the Amazonian countries (1.2% or over 200,000 hectares per year) as a result of agricultural expansion by landless poor, timber extraction, and petroleum production.
The purpose of this Strategic Objective (SO) is to conserve the biodiversity in selected protected areas and their buffer zones and to develop models for replication throughout Ecuador.
With the replication of these models by the Government of Ecuador (GOE) and other donors, ultimate beneficiaries will be the majority of the nation's poor, especially women, children and Ecuador's indigenous communities who directly depend on sustainable use of natural resources.
Key Results: Key intermediate results will be a strengthened capacity of targeted non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations (CSOs) active in biodiversity conservation; the adoption of economically viable natural resources management (NRM) practices; and key policies and legal frameworks introduced and/or implemented to conserve biodiversity.
It is estimated that total funding for conservation activities implemented by key partners (NGOs/CSOs) will have increased from $1.1 million in FY 1997, to $3.8 million in FY 2003 and that the administrative and financial capabilities of these partners will have been significantly strengthened.
By the end of FY 2003, 2,205,900 hectares of land in selected protected areas and their buffer zones will be under participatory natural resources management plans.
Also, 341,000 hectares of community land will be under legal title in the buffer zones outside of selected protected areas.
Performance and Prospects: With USAID support, some critical steps towards improved NRM and biodiversity protection have been taken.
Of particular significance is the development of the national legal framework that enables the demarcation of community lands.
The paralegal program has trained and assisted local people in community law and legal advocacy on issues such as land titling and natural resource access rights.
Partner NGOs have developed coalitions of community groups, local governments and private enterprises that will be better able to influence GOE policy and achieve economic sustainability of natural resources while preserving Ecuador's biodiversity.
Ecuadorian NGO partners have been strengthened.
Activities in the Cotacachi-Cayapas (RECC), Antisana, and the Cayambe-Coca (RECAY) Ecological Reserves are strengthening secondary-level organizations to test and extend models of sustainable biological resource use.
Resource management plans have been completed for 938,300 hectares in and around the ecological reserves.
Indigenous communities have received formal, legal title for 24,000 hectares of ancestral lands, also located in and around the ecological reserves.
Agroforestry/garden plots have been implemented in communities in the buffer zones.
Commercialization activities are now producing significant results as community forestry initiatives are helping local communities in the RECC buffer zone to obtain an increase in profits from sustainable forestry operations, ecotourism, cheese making, and handicraft activities.
USAID successfully sponsored the establishment of an endowment fund through water-user fees collected for the management and protection of RECAY/REA, which is the major source of water for greater metropolitan Quito.
Community park guards are bolstering the weak park protection system with assistance from USAID partners and second-level organizations.
The Galapagos Marine Reserve has been designated as a protected biological area.
The Special Law for the Galapagos Islands, which, among other important aspects, prohibits commercial fishing within forty miles of most parts of the islands and empowers local institutions to take the leadership in the affairs of the archipelago, was approved by the Ecuadorian Congress and published in the Official Register.
Since its approval in Congress however, nineteen months have gone by without implementing regulations signed by President Mahuad.
The main reason for the delay is the opposition pressure from commercial fishermen who want to fish within the forty-mile radius of the Galapagos Marine Reserve.
Because the general framework for the Galapagos Regulations has not yet been signed, specific regulations to control immigration, quarantine of products brought to the islands, etc could not be presented to the President and the enforcement of the new Galapagos Legislation is more difficult and, in some areas, impossible.
Relations between scientists at the research station and local fishermen in the Galapagos have greatly improved and a result of this is the discussion, development and approval of the Galapagos Marine Reserve Management Plan.
In addition, USAID contributed to the establishment of a capital fund for the benefit of the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galapagos Islands to guide the development of the sustainable, scientifically based, participatory management of the Galapagos ecosystem.
USAID is also assisting the Ministry of the Environment to establish policies, strategies and legislation for sustainable forestry development and biodiversity conservation in Ecuador
.
USAID will continue ongoing activities in the protected and buffer zone areas of the RECC and the RECAY/REA to develop replicable models.
Ecuadorian partner NGOs will carry out the types of activities currently being developed and tested in and around protected areas in additional communities.
Key activities include forest management, land demarcation and titling, and the development of income-producing ventures based on non-timber forest products and efforts to strengthen forest dwellers' (including indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorians) claims to land and resources, and to prepare them to enter into productive partnerships with the commercial sector.
Support will continue to the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galapagos for the conservation and preservation of the Islands' marine reserves and their native and endemic species.
Also, it is expected that stakeholders will implement the Galapagos Marine Reserve Management Plan.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: None contemplated.
Other Donor Programs: Host country, other donor and NGO contributions to achieve the SO total over $2 million.
Complementary contributions include World Bank and IDB funds exceeding $28 million.
The World Bank, through its Global Environmental Facility, is financing a biodiversity protection project, which complements USAID-supported activities in the Galapagos, RECC and RECAY.
In addition, the IDB is financing a feasibility study that may lead to a loan of up to $15 million for environmental activities in the Galapagos.
Although USAID provides only a small proportion of total donor assistance in this sector, USAID environmental activities are on the cutting edge and lay the groundwork for other major donors.
For example, the IDB is capitalizing on the solid waste management and quarantine studies previously supported by USAID in the Galapagos to expand this activity.
Principal Contractors, Grantees or Agencies: USAID funding is provided principally to U.S. and Ecuadorian NGOs.
Key partners include CARE/Ecuador, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the Charles Darwin Foundation.
Both CARE and TNC have developed strong working relationships with Ecuadorian partners (e.g. EcoCiencia, Jatun Sacha, Antisana Foundation, Rumicocha Ecological Foundation, Arco Iris Foundation, and Natura Foundation) which, in turn, work with local customers, e.g. community groups and indigenous organizations, to carry out planned activities.
In addition, specific activities are being undertaken in collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Peace Corps.

PROGRAM: Ecuador TITLE AND NUMBER: : Increased Use of Sustainable Family Planning/Maternal Child Health Services, 518-002 PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: $6,800,000 (DA), $550,000 (CSD) PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: none STATUS: Continuing INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1995 ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: FY 2001
Summary: This SO was scheduled for phase-out at the end of FY 2000.
However, a one-year limited extension of SO 2 "Increased use of sustainable family planning/maternal child health services" to the end of FY2001 was approved by AA/LAC on October 15, 1999, in order to continue supporting the two largest family planning NGOs in Ecuador, Association for Ecuadorian Family Well Being (APROFE) and Medical Center for Orientation and Family Planning (CEMOPLAF).
This one-year extension may become insufficient to achieve full sustainability of targets by 2001, in the wake of the sharp depreciation of the exchange rate by 195% in 1999 and the inflation rate that reached 61%.
Health activities under SO 2 will come to an end by September 30, 2000 as planned, including bilateral assistance to the Ministry of Health (MOH), CARE and Center for the Studies of Population and Social Development (CEPAR) Cooperative Agreements.
The purpose of extending assistance under this SO is to increase the use of sustainable, voluntary Family Planning (FP) and Maternal Child Health (MCH) services.
Children under five and fertile-aged women represent the principal beneficiaries of this SO. By the year 2001, approximately two million women and children will have benefited from services developed, improved and/or expanded with USAID assistance over a 25-year period.
Key Results: Key results in FY 2001 will be the increased sustainability of FP NGO partners, and improved quality and access to FP services.
Cost recovery will permit 90% financial self-sufficiency for APROFE and CEMOPLAF.
Couple years of protection (CYP) provided by APROFE and CEMOPLAF will have increased from 279,117 in FY 1994, to an estimated 750,000 in FY 2001.
Performance and Prospects: In the areas of FP and population, USAID continues to be the major donor and therefore a critical actor in achieving reduced fertility, increased contraceptive use to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and improved women's health, especially through NGO service providers.
In FP, activities will focus on support to the network of 41 private clinics operated by USAID's two Ecuadorian NGO partners, thereby preserving USAID's considerable investment over the past three decades and ensuring the continued provision of quality FP and MCH services through the private sector.
To achieve the self-sustainability of these programs and to better serve the poor, USAID will assist partners in the areas of cost-effective service delivery, commodity management, effective marketing of products and services, and in the cross subsidization of health and family planning services.
Our NGO FP partners have reached high levels of cost recovery, while remaining focused on access provision to less affluent and underserved populations of women.
In 1999, these NGOs reached an average of over 80% cost recovery.
USAID support for these NGOs through the year 2001 will enable them to achieve an average of 90% financial self-reliance.
Additionally, significant increases in their program income should ensure their financial sustainability over the long term.
In the health sector, USAID support for self-sustaining models of decentralized health care succeeded in both increasing the use of improved MCH/Child survival services, as well as providing several viable models of health reform.
CARE/APOLO support to several local NGOs has been the major contribution to these results during 1998-1999, with notable success in 1999 to coordinate these efforts with World Bank, IDB, Ministry of Health and municipalities.
This should guarantee continuation and expansion of models after phasing-out of USG assistance in health at the end of FY 2000.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Based on AA/LAC approval of extension of SO 2 thru September 2001, APROFE and CEMOPLAF are actively working to offset the sharp depreciation of the currency by introducing innovative marketing programs and reducing its cost structure for the provision of FP services.
These organizations are analyzing the impact that the recent GOE decision to substitute the Ecuadorian Sucre with the US Dollar will have on sustainability fund targets through 2001.
Other Donor Programs: Due to the FY 2000 phase-out of USAID support in the health sector, donor coordination has become a key component of USAID activities, thereby sustaining and replicating our program investments.
The major donor in this sector is the World Bank, through two large loans: $45 million for health sector modernization, emphasizing decentralized health networks; and an ongoing $70 million loan for strengthening the MOH and for supporting the construction of health, water and sanitation facilities; and a national nutrition program.
UNFPA and UNICEF are major contributors to MCH programs and limited financial resources also come from the IDB, especially for the Social Security hospital system.
Major bilateral assistance to the sector comes from Japan, with lesser amounts from the Governments of Canada, Holland, Belgium and Spain.
USAID has been a leading source of technical assistance, along with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Bank.
USAID technical assistance and pilot interventions have served as catalysts for leveraging inputs of World Bank and IDB funds.
In FY 2001 these Banks will fund at least 3 major pilot activities initiated by USAID.
Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies: USAID will implement FP activities through two local NGOs, and 2-3 key field support contractors.
In family planning, major partners are two Ecuadorian family planning NGOs, APROFE and CEMOPLAF, with critical inputs related to social marketing, operations research and logistics management provided by Johns Hopkins University (both JHPIEGO and the Population Communications Services Program), and John Snow Inc.

PROGRAM: Ecuador TITLE AND NUMBER: More Effective and Fair Criminal Justice System, 518-003 PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: $1,450,000 (DA), $1,500,000 (ESF) PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: $2,000,000 (DA), $6,000,000 (ESF) STATUS: Continuing INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1996 ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: FY 2003
Summary: A new Democracy SO was designed during FY 1999 to respond to the changes in the conditions favoring justice reform resulting from the inauguration of a reformist President in August 1998, a justice-oriented Constitution which came into effect the same month, and the recent creation of key justice sector institutions.
The new SO seeks to contribute to the rule of law in Ecuador by assisting public sector justice institutions with the active participation of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to establish a more effective and fair criminal justice system that better fights corruption.
Many Latin American countries are attempting, with varying degrees of success to change from inquisitory to more accusatory justice systems because of the greater efficacy and fairness of accusatory systems that establish a clear distinction between the roles of investigators, prosecutors, and judges.
USAID contributed during FY 1999 to important developments in this regard.
In 1999 the Ecuadorian Congress approved a new Criminal Procedures Code that was largely defective, particularly in impeding the effective investigation of complex crimes of corruption by prohibiting confidential investigations.
USAID, with the collaboration of the U.S. Department of Justice, substantially contributed to a presidential veto of 118 of the 365 articles of the Code and proposed technical amendments to strengthen it.
Since the Ecuadorian Congress could not override the veto, the revised code was automatically approved, and will provide a solid foundation to begin implementation of a new USAID program.
Moreover, with these changes the code would be one of the most advanced in Latin American by providing the basis for effective, confidential investigations.
This Code, combined with adequate training, technical assistance, enforcement techniques, and support from civil society is essential for the establishment of an effective criminal justice system in Ecuador.
USAID also promoted a strengthened relationship between the Prosecutor General's Office and the National Judicial Police, both of whom expressed their commitment to work together in criminal investigations.
USAID funded an Ecuadorian lawyer for more than a year to work closely with the Public Ministry and Police as follow-up to four DOJ assessments of the sector, and to study the proposed reforms of the CPC.
He provided an understanding of local law and reform conditions to the DOJ resident legal expert, who recently arrived in Ecuador to analyze the Code and to provide technical assistance and training to prosecutors and police.
USAID also established an NGO fund to support criminal justice reform initiatives of NGO/public sector alliances; and became the only donor to provide technical assistance to the GOE for addressing the worst banking crisis in the history of Ecuador.
Critical ESF funds were used for strengthening the Deposit Guarantee Agency's technical capacity to manage bank assets under its receivership.
The unfolding of the justice reform movement during 1999 has been mixed.
On the positive side, political will seems to exist in cases of highly visible corruption (e.g. the jailing of the most powerful banker for the fraudulent use of public finances) and the overhaul through a Presidential veto of a major part of the defective Criminal Procedures Code approved by Congress.
On the negative side, there have been political manipulations of the justice system (e.g. the politically motivated selection of judges), and the approval by Congress, with virtually no debate, of a Criminal Procedures Code that, as passed by the Congress, would have impeded effective confidential investigations.
Furthermore, public attention was diverted from the technical improvements of the Code, introduced by the USAID-supported Presidential veto, because of the last minute insertion by the President of a highly controversial article perceived as politically motivated and as favoring a corrupt former President.
This politicization constitutes one more obstacle to overcome in attempting to change the mentality of the judges towards a more accusatory system.
USAID will closely monitor the program during FY 2000 to assess the level of political will and the overall progress of the program in order to make a final decision on whether or not conditions exist to proceed with the program, reorient it, or change to another Democracy objective.
Key Results: The SO has three key results to be achieved by FY 2003.
The first is to improve the capacity of government to combat public and private sector corruption.
To achieve this, an anti-corruption task force enabling a team approach to investigations will be established by the end of FY 2000, and judges will be collaborating with the task force and accepting cases for trial by FY 2001.
The first task force already has been established to investigate financial fraud.
It is composed of police investigators, prosecutors, and a technical consultant who have received specialized training in financial crime investigative techniques, as well as working-team approaches to conduct investigations.
The second is the introduction of accusatory principles and oral procedures into the Ecuadorian court system.
To achieve this, at least 40% of the training of court personnel responsible for implementing the new Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) will be completed by the end of FY 2000, and three courts will be using oral procedures by the end of FY 2001.
The third is to strengthen constituencies and coalitions among public and private institutions participating in priority reforms.
The outcome of these coalitions will be the institutionalization of the public legal defense system between the public and private sectors.
Performance and Prospects: Funding in FY 1999 for activities led to the achievement of several benchmarks that improved prospects for future success.
The establishment by the Prosecutor General's Office of a "Financial Crimes Task Force" played a key role in jailing one of the most powerful bankers for the fraudulent use of public finances.
The new CPC, which now includes important modifications proposed by the Presidency, will allow effective investigation of criminal cases.
This presidential veto indicates political will by some important reformers within the GOE to carry out justice reform.
An agreement was signed between the Prosecutor General and the National Judicial Police to cooperate in crime investigations.
NGO services and access to justice for women's and indigenous groups underwent a significant expansion and institutionalization during FY 1999.
A total of 32,432 victims of domestic violence accessed legal services; and 660 families used ADR and related legal services.
In addition, financial sustainability of the three most active and influential justice sector NGOs was improved.
A recent evaluation report concluded that training and technical assistance provided to these NGOs have been effective and that these organizations will be prepared in FY 2000 to work without USAID financial support.
As stated earlier, the new Code (with the inclusion of changes proposed in the presidential veto) will provide a solid foundation to begin implementation of the USAID Program.
The Code includes several necessary elements that allow effective investigation of crimes.
The eighteen-month transition period allows sufficient time for key players - prosecutors, police, and judges- to prepare for its implementation.
A group of prominent justice sector leaders are willing to join forces to introduce additional reforms to the Code during this transition period.
The breakthrough in establishing a working relationship between prosecutors and the police who will form anti-corruption task forces will improve efforts to fight corruption.
The National Judiciary Council that is responsible for the training and the disciplinary oversight of judges has demonstrated positive results during its initial period in action.
It has disciplined corrupt judges and demonstrated its willingness to collaborate in the training of judges under the new CPC, the introduction of oral proceedings, and the improvement of its systems to sanction corrupt practices within the judiciary.
The Prosecutor General has started to coordinate anti-corruption efforts with the other relevant investigative agencies.
In addition, the Justice Sector Integral Reform Plan was updated to prioritize criminal justice as one of the areas targeted by the GOE for international financing by other donors.
The support of other donors is needed for follow-on to USAID pilot efforts.
Finally, the timely assistance of international experts in the area of financial transparency that were selected from the SEGIR Buy-In, led to the development of asset restructuring and disposition manuals, urgent advice on information systems, and preparatory work for due diligence for the Deposit Guarantee Agency.
The success of the program also depends on appropriations in the national budget to the Prosecutor General's Office.
Without this support, it cannot carry out its new responsibilities.
Also, the program requires from the GOE its support of key officials (e.g. Prosecutor General, Director of the National Judicial Council.)
The establishment of a Justice Sector Reform Committee, or another mechanism to lead and/or coordinate the implementation of the new criminal justice system in the country, is also essential to the success of USAID's efforts.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: Future work with Ecuador's Congress to approve necessary legislation will have to be defined with the legislators and the input (regarding the content of the reforms) from the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ)'s representative in Ecuador.
Other Donor Programs: The World Bank's $10.5 million program in civil justice reform will terminate next year.
The WB is planning to send a Mission to Ecuador in March 2000 to design a new program.
WB and USAID officials will discuss possible cooperating activities and the inclusion of criminal justice into the WB agenda.
USAID is closely coordinating related activities with the IDB $2.5 million program that includes support for the institutional strengthening of the Prosecutor General's office and judicial training.
The UNDP is defining its strategy and USAID has had extensive conversations with its representative to promote the inclusion of related criminal justice sector efforts.
The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is about to define its strategy and is discussing with USAID relevant cooperation.
There are good prospects to promote the involvement of the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) in the financing of reforms in the justice sector.
The activity in financial transparency has established the basis for future financing of a $12 million dollar loan from the World Bank that will be used for due diligence on $3 billion dollars of bank assets in the DGA.
Principal Contractors, Grantees or Agencies: Development assistance for the Prosecutor General's Office is being carried out under a joint agreement with the Offices of OPDAT and ICITAP (Department of Justice).
USAID's main partner in the justice sector is the Esquel Foundation that works closely with the National Justice Sector NGO Network.
This NGO has successfully created alliances of NGOs with public sector institutions.
A competitive selection process for an institutional contractor that can implement a training program for judges is being carried out during this FY 2000.
Public sector partners include the Supreme Court (CSJ), the National Judiciary Council (CNJ), the Public Ministry, the Judicial Police, and the National Congress.
BARENTS GROUP LLC is carrying out technical assistance for the DGA.

PROGRAM: Ecuador TITLE AND NUMBER: Improved Sustainable Capacity of Selected Public and Private Institutions to Prevent/Control Pollution, 518-004 PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: none PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: none STATUS: Continuing INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1995 ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: FY 2000
Summary: Ecuador's urban growth rate--one of the highest in the hemisphere--is placing increased demands on national and municipal governments for critical environmental services and improved pollution prevention.
The largely unmanaged growth in many cities, particularly coastal cities such as Guayaquil, Duran, Machala, Esmeraldas and others, has caused significant increases in both household and industrial contamination, resulting in serious environmental degradation and human health hazards.
This environmental degradation affects the quality of life and economic productivity of large segments of the Ecuadorian population, particularly the poor who live in marginal neighborhoods without access to clean water, adequate sewerage disposal, or garbage and waste collection.
They are thus exposed to serious health risks.
The problem of inadequate services is frequently compounded by these communities' proximity to industrial areas whose pollution goes largely uncontrolled, adding to already high toxicity levels.
The purpose of assistance under this Special Objective (SpO) is to improve the sustainable capacity of selected public and private institutions to prevent pollution.
Ecuador's increasing urban and peri-urban residents who lack access to potable water, sanitary systems and a pollution-free, residential and work environment, benefit from these activities.
Key Results: Key results in FY 2000 will be the number of industrial plants implementing cleaner production technology in their production processes; and, the number of municipalities adopting cleaner production policies and/or improved solid waste management practices.
It is estimated that 100 industrial plants will have implemented cleaner production techniques; and, 25 municipalities will have adopted solid waste management practices.
Promotion efforts have greatly expanded public awareness on cleaner production initiatives and their implementation, as demonstrated by the openness of industrialists to espouse the initiatives, the introduction of environmental concerns in university curricula, and the interest of the business community in receiving more information and assistance in these areas.
Therefore, other related results are the number of municipalities, universities, entities and industrial firms provided with information necessary to initiate cleaner production options and technologies; to address international trade environmental concerns, and: to better manage urban environmental problems.
It is estimated that 209 municipalities, 35 universities, 200 entities and 400 industrial firms will have been provided with such information by the end of FY 2000
Performance and Prospects: Recent efforts have focussed on ensuring the sustainability of past USAID investments, which sought to strengthen the technical, fund-raising and income-generation capabilities of Oikos Corporation, an Ecuadorian NGO active in promoting scientific, technical and educational approaches for environmental management.
As USAID support is phased out, this final funding is needed to ensure that partner organizations begin to stand on their own.
Oikos Corporation will continue working with various chambers of industries to improve production techniques, while reducing pollution and costs.
In addition, Oikos assistance to municipalities in the adoption of cleaner production policies and improved solid waste management practices will continue.
Oikos Corporation has developed innovative approaches to involve the population in pollution prevention and reduction measures, and has been effective in promoting debate at the national level regarding priorities for pollution prevention and control.
The cleaner production and energy efficiency strategy which Oikos Corporation uses to implement its activities has been very effective in convincing an increasing number of Ecuadorian industries to adopt cleaner production technologies and energy efficiency practices.
The sustainability of Oikos Corporation activities supported by USAID is enhanced through user fees Oikos Corporation charges for the services it provides to industries and municipalities.
In addition, Oikos has in place a sustainability plan which maps out specific steps for reducing its dependence on USAID funding and increasing its own contribution, as well as those obtained from other sources.
Funds have also been provided to enable municipalities to identify and prioritize environmental problems, adopt practical, low-cost solutions, and to seek the collaboration of the private sector.
Models are being developed in selected coastal cities and in the Amazonian region to manage solid waste through concessions with environmental micro-enterprises.
USAID efforts to strengthen the administrative and accounting capabilities of selected municipalities and environmental micro-enterprises will contribute to their long-term institutional and financial self-sustainability.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: None are contemplated at this time.
Other Donor Programs: Oikos Corporation has received small amounts of assistance from other donors for pollution prevention activities, principally UNIDO, UNDP, and IDB.
It is anticipated that the USAID-supported program for environmental assessments of industries will be continued by Oikos Corporation with German and Swiss support.
Host country and NGO contributions to achieve this objective total over $1,500,000.
Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies: USAID implements pollution prevention activities primarily through Oikos Corporation.

PROGRAM: Ecuador TITLE AND NUMBER: Increased Access to Financial Services by Micro-entrepreneurs, 518-005 PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: none PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: none STATUS: Continuing INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 1996 ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: FY 2000
Summary: Experience worldwide shows that micro-entrepreneurs represent a vast pool of hardworking people who, given access to minimal resources, can evolve into a formidable force contributing to job creation, poverty alleviation, democratic stability, and economic growth.
The World Bank's 1995 Ecuador Poverty Report and other studies on the sector show that, in Ecuador, this pool of micro-entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs is over 1.1 million people, who have between 400,000-450,000 microenterprise businesses.
Over half of these are women.
USAID has designed activities to bring quality financial services to the poor, thereby helping them to build stronger enterprises which ultimately improve their incomes and quality of life.
Two principal problem areas are targeted: outreach and financial sustainability.
Outreach aims at providing large numbers of poor people, especially the very poor and women, access to quality financial services.
Financial sustainability refers to the creation and/or strengthening of existing institutions that become independent of continuing inputs from government, international agencies or charitable organizations.
Key Results: Key results will be new licensed, for-profit financial institutions serving the needs of micro-entrepreneurs; upgraded micro-credit delivery systems of selected financial institutions and NGOs; and strengthened institutions implementing village banking programs.
By the end of FY 2000, at least one, formal financial institution will be serving the needs of micro-entrepreneurs through credit and savings programs, the quality of financial services by partner financial institutions and NGOs will have improved significantly, and an estimated 754 village banks will have been established against a baseline of 80 in FY 1996.
Performance and Prospects: Micro-credit activities were initiated in FY 1996, with a major USAID contribution to two U.S. PVOs for equity investments in a fully private bank, Banco Solidario, established for the purpose of serving Ecuador's microenterprise sector.
Through FY 1999, Banco Solidario improved its delivery of financial services to micro-entrepreneurs, through its ten branch offices in suburban Quito, Guayaquil and other, smaller cities.
USAID equity investments, made through Seed Capital Development Fund (SCDF) and CARE, permitted Banco Solidario to meet its capitalization targets of $18.0 million required by the Superintendency of Banks.
As of September 1999, its microcredit portfolio had grown to 14,000 active clients.
Village banking activities with our partners Catholic Relief Services, Project Hope and Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA) created 361 new village banks, benefiting an additional 8,000 poor women.
These partners have continued experiencing significant growth and have moved toward achieving financial self-sustainability.
The planned target of 100% self-sustainability by FY 2000 appears realistic.
USAID has also conducted an analysis of the formal banking system and has identified several formal, commercial banks interested in microenterprise lending as a means of significantly expanding sources of credit to the microenterprise sector.
Technical assistance and training has been provided to selected banks, one of them, Banco del Pichincha through Credife, which started micro-lending operations in March 1999.
Through FY 1999-2000, USAID will continue to provide technical assistance and training to Banco Solidario and has invested through SCDF in an International Guarantee Trust Fund called LA-CIF, that will provide loan guarantees to microenterprise borrowers in Ecuador.
During FY 2000 USAID will also continue to work with the formal banking system (Credife Desarrollo Microempresarial) by providing a matching fund for technical assistance, enabling an expansion of this important additional source of credit to the microenterprise sector.
In FY 1999, USAID also provided additional funding to village banking aimed at establishing a network of NGOs with sustainable anti-poverty lending programs in different geographical areas of the country.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: On January 9, 2000 the President of Ecuador announced a program to substitute the Ecuadorian "Sucre" with the US dollar as a principal currency in the country.
USAID will be meeting with its counterparts to analyze the impact of this reform and the possibility of adjusting the targets for this program.
Other Donor Programs: USAID's total $1.9 million equity investment in Banco Solidario played an important catalytic role, leveraging some $3.2 million in additional equity for this bank from other donors, namely the Andean Development Corporation ($500,000), ProFund ($1.7 million) and Accion International ($1 million).
A key partner, Seed Capital Development Fund, played a role in obtaining a portion of this financing.
The only other large donor in this sector is the IDB, which operated two lines of credit in the amounts of $16 million and $2.5 million for credit and technical assistance, respectively, through the National Financial Corporation.
USAID played an important catalytic role, leveraging an estimated $3 million from the IDB to continue its support for the entry of formal, commercial banks into the microenterprise sector.
The World Council of Credit Unions indirectly serves the microenterprise sector, providing technical assistance worth $500,000 annually to 19 credit unions, whose members include micro-entrepreneurs.
Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies: USAID's assistance to microentrepreneurs is being implemented primarily through U.S. and Ecuadorian NGOs.
Technical assistance has been provided by Accion International, CARE, Development Alternatives Inc., and Carana Associates.
Equity financing mechanisms for Ecuadorian microcredit financial institutions have been developed with CARE and Seed Capital Development Fund.
Village banking activities are undertaken with U.S. PVOs Catholic Relief Services, FINCA, and Project HOPE.
Selected Performance Measures: Baseline (1996) Actual (1998) Target (1999) Target (2000) Increase in the number of Microentrepreneurs assisted by USAID partner organizations (cumulative, disaggregated by gender) 1,300 men 1,000 women 6,400 men 15,100 women 10,700 men 23,500 women 15,800 men 34,200 women

ACTIVITY DATA SHEET
PROGRAM: Ecuador TITLE AND NUMBER: Northern Ecuador Border Development, 518-xxx PLANNED FY 2000 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: $3,000,000 (Plan Colombia) PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND ACCOUNT: none STATUS: Initial INITIAL OBLIGATION: FY 2000 ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE: FY 2002
Summary: Consolidation of the legitimate government presence of municipalities along Ecuador's northern border, taking into consideration their role as political authority and service provider, will help prevent Colombian narco-traffickers and coca and poppy growers from moving their operations into this region.
The Clinton Administration is proposing additional funding for a regional counter-narcotics program under the Plan Colombia FY 2000 Supplemental.
In anticipation of this request, USAID/Ecuador is proposing this objective.
As pressure is increased to end illicit drug activities in the Department of Putumayo in Colombia, maintaining a stable buffer zone between the two countries becomes a regional priority.
Assistance will target priority communities in the Sucumbios Province, with concentration in the cantons of Putumayo and Lago Agrio.
The activity objective is to safeguard regional stability by strengthening local governance, and meeting the basic needs of the population by implementing quick impact, high visibility activities such as health, water and sanitation.
Microcredit opportunities for income generation will also be explored.
The northern border of Ecuador, where it forms an international boundary with Colombia, is currently the "R 
The principal formal government presence is that of the military.
Since the signing of the peace accords with Peru in October 1998, the Ecuadorian military has focused its border protection efforts along the Colombia border.
Their "containment" role has met with mixed reactions from the local population, many of whom make a living off of active cross-border trade (both legitimate and illegal) with Colombia.
This has been even more the case during the past year as Ecuador's economy has gone into a tailspin.
With formal unemployment rising to 19%, and underemployment to over 50%, more and more people are seeking economic opportunities through informal cross-border commerce.
The underemployed population has become more mobile, moving back and forth across the northern border in search of any and all income generating activities that present themselves.
With the economic growth rate dropping to an estimated negative 7-8% in 1999, and the inflation rate reaching 61% (the highest in Latin America), Ecuador's vulnerable economy is ripe for "takeover" by those who offer alternative sources of income, at whatever price.
Portions of the northern region are much more developed than the long-disputed Ecuadorian border with Peru, thus making it particularly attractive and accessible for cross-border commerce.
More remote sections in the north, however, are basically abandoned, thus making uncontrolled border crossings easy.
This combination of extreme underdevelopment and a permeable border has proven very attractive to the Colombian guerillas that are known to come and go at will.
Like the municipalities along the southern border, those along the Colombia border are weak in their political organization and ability to service the local population, particularly in the most sensitive Province of Sucumbios, bordering Colombia's Putumayo Department.
Problems affecting the majority of the population include inadequate access to clean water and sanitation, minimal solid waste disposal, limited and highly unstable employment opportunities, and accelerated destruction of the area's natural resource base.
Improvement in these conditions will be key to creating a legitimate presence and authority that serves as a buffer against the incursion of Colombian traffickers who have never regarded the border as a constraint to their transnational activities.
The major threat to Ecuador from Colombian cross border incursions related to illicit drug production or trafficking, as well as guerrilla intrusions, is in the border Province of Sucumbios, both due to its remoteness, poverty levels and already weak loyalty to the national government.
Besides being located directly across from the "hot zone" of Putumayo, Colombia, Sucumbios Province is one of the poorest, most rural and lacking in social services of any province in the country.
Of its total population of 144,000, living in an area nearly as large as the country of El Salvador, two-thirds live in 4 municipalities (cantons) bordering Colombia.
These include the municipalities of Lago Agrio, the provincial capital with 65,000 people; geographically large Putumayo, with only 8,000 people; and the smaller in area municipalities of Cascales and Sucumbios to the west-- together having some 20,000 population.
In these cantons, the population is nearly 70% rural and 90% living below the poverty level -- that is, with an estimated per capita income of only a few hundred dollars -- and unable to purchase the basic marketbasket of goods.
With Ecuador's average per capita income for 1999 already projected to drop 32% to $1,101 as a result of the deepening economic crisis, the extreme vulnerability of the entire northern border to illegitimate economic activity cannot be overstated.
Key Results: Health, Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Management Systems - 10,000 persons with new improved water and sanitation solutions, 5-10 new or rehabilitated water systems functioning, 25,000 persons benefiting from improved garbage collection and solid waste disposal, and 50,000 people benefiting from new health services; and Local Government Strengthening - 2-4 municipalities strengthened, 2-4 local development committees functioning, 2-4 municipal water and sanitation boards formed or strengthened.
Performance and Prospects: * Health, Water and Sanitation Services: The Mission has a long and successful history of implementing projects in this sector, from construction of rural water systems, to training of health promoters.
Most recently, through a Regional Housing and Urban Development program, more efficient models of municipal waste disposal and recycling, combined with micro-enterprises in these cities, have proven very successful and can be replicated or expanded in the northern border cities of Lago Agrio and Puerto el Carmen de Putumayo.
The Peru-Ecuador border program of $1.5 million, just initiated is concentrating on health, water and sanitation services, using cost and technical models fully compatible with needs on the northern border.
The planned northern border activity would build or improve water systems and sanitation units benefiting 10,000 persons, solid waste disposal benefiting as many as 25,000 and health services improvements for up to 50,000 * Local Government Strengthening: Decentralization of authority and responsibility, combined with effective functioning of local government and incorporation of their citizen's participation in planning of services, provides both better services and strengthened democracy.
The commitment of both GOE policy and donor resources to these tasks will be essential to effectively carrying out the other activities described above.
Local government capacity building will be an integral part of many of the activities described above, not mainly a stand-alone activity.
Implementation mechanisms will likely be through NGOs, rather than directly with municipalities, given the complexities of handling USAID funds through several local government units.
This program will provide extensive technical assistance and training to local level officials to strengthen and develop management skills.
Local development committees, made up of civil society and governmental representatives, will fully participate in the decision-making process.
The focus will be on how to strengthen municipalities' capacity to plan and implement projects that respond to the needs of their population, thereby contributing to effective decentralization as well.
Possible Adjustments to Plans: While the initial focus of activities will be social services infrastructure related to health, water and sanitation, and strengthening local government capacity and consequent legitimacy with the people it serves, the program will be designed to accommodate additional activities that could exploit micro-enterprise opportunities such as small loans to improve income or generate employment.
The Mission has excellent experience with micro-finance and village banking through three US NGOs now working in this field in Ecuador.
Urban commercial areas of Lago Agrio and possibly Putumayo would be the focus of these activities, which may require more time and funding than is currently available.
Other Donor Programs: There is little current donor activity in this area of Ecuador, precisely because of the difficulties of working here, and the increasing security concerns in recent years.
The German Agency for Technical Cooperation's (GTZ's) aid program has been providing some funding and technical assistance in Lago Agrio, complimentary to our solid waste program.
USAID itself has also supported a local NGO health and family planning clinic in Lago Agrio.
It is worth noting however that Sucumbios Province also borders on Peru, and as such, is one of the eight Ecuadorian provinces included in the Ecuador-Peru Binational Peace Plan.
The GOE is seeking major funding for projects in this province as part of its presentation to donors at the postponed Consultative Group meeting now scheduled for late March.
For example, more than $2.5 million is requested for water and sanitation projects in Sucumbios, and additional major funding for health, education and productive infrastructure.
Once donor pledges to Sucumbios under the Binational Plan are firmed up, USAID will further coordinate interventions in these areas as appropriate.
Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies: TBD, through open competition among US NGOs.
Selected Performance Measures: As USAID/Ecuador plans for this program, it will develop a number of indicators to measure the results of these activities will be developed.
The following is a preliminary, illustrative list of these indicators: * Increased availability of social services will be measured by (a) number of persons benefiting from new/improved water, sanitation, solid waste and health services; (b)number of improved water systems, sanitation units; (c) garbage collection programs; and (d) number of health services and facilities improved or constructed; and * Local government strengthening results will include (a) number of municipalities strengthened in their capacity to develop and implement development projects; (b) number of local development committees with effective participation in planning and prioritizing development needs; and (c) number of municipalities with functioning Departments of Water and Environment capable of managing an/or maintaining water/sanitation and solid waste activities as well as environmental protection activities.
Note: If micro-finance activities are added, indicators would include number of new income generating opportunities; number of village banks established and number of micro-enterpreneurs receiving credit.
