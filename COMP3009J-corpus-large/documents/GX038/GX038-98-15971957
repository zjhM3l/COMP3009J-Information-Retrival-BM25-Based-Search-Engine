To: All District Managers From: State Director Subject: Pacific Yew Act
On January 26, 1998, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior notified relevant Congressional committees of their concurrence with the Secretary of Health and Human Services' February 14, 1993, determination that quantities of taxol sufficient to satisfy medicinal demands are available from sources other than Pacific yew harvested from Federal lands.
This is the final provision of the Pacific Yew Act.
The requirements of the Act are hereby null and void.
With the expiration of the Act's requirements, we are now free to sell Pacific yew to parties other than Bristol-Meyer Squibb, and for purposes other than medicine.
In other words, yew may be sold to traditional users, such as wood crafters and farmers.
All sales of yew must be consistent with the requirements of the Resource Management Plans.
If you should receive requests for the sale of significant quantities of yew bark or foliage, however, please notify Lyndon Werner (OR-931) (503-952-6071).
We have jointly prepared the attached set of questions and answers with the Forest Service for general information purposes.
Please provide your public affairs and other staff with a copy.
If you have questions or comments regarding the management or sale of Pacific yew, please contact Lyndon Werner.

Questions and Answers; Pacific Yew Act February 12, 1998
Introduction: On August 7, 1992, Congress passed the Pacific Yew Act, 16USC 4801-4807.
- What was the purpose of the Pacific Yew Act? The purpose of the Act was to contribute to the successful treatment of cancer by ensuring that Pacific yew trees on Federal lands were managed to:
* Provide for efficient collection and utilization of plant material for use in the manufacture of taxol;* Provide Pacific yew material from Federal lands for conversion to taxol that would result in a reasonable cost for cancer patients; * Provide for the long-term conservation of Pacific yew on Federal lands; and * Prevent the wasting of Pacific yew trees while successful and affordable alternative methods of manufacturing taxol were developed.
- What were the requirements imposed by the Pacific Yew Act? - The USDA, Forest Service and USDI, BLM were to pursue a conservation and management policy for sustainable harvest of yew and to provide for long-term conservation of yew in the wild.
- Each agency was encouraged to assist in research on the ecology of yew, development of alternative methods of procuring taxol, and the propagation of yew in commercial settings.
- The agencies were authorized to sell yew in a timely manner only to parties manufacturing taxol in accordance with section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
- Yew which was unusable for taxol could be made available to other parties.
- The agencies were required to make an annual report to Congress containing their judgement as to whether sufficient amounts of yew have and can continue to be harvested to supply the need for taxol and the results of a Pacific yew inventory.
- How did the Pacific Yew Act's requirements expire?
The Act contained an expiration clause stating that when the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, and Health and Human Services jointly inform Congress that enough taxol is available from alternative sources to satisfy medicinal demands, the Act's requirements will expire.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services was responsible for making the determination that enough taxol was available and the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior were required to concur in this determination.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services so notified the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior on February 14, 1995.
The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior jointly informed Congress of their concurrence on January 26, 1998.
Attachment 1-1 __________________________________________________________________
Why did the Pacific Yew Act's requirements expire?
The requirements of the Act have been fulfilled and its provisions are unnecessary.
Expiration of the Act's requirements will reduce administrative burdens, provide more flexibility, and less confusion in day-to-day management of Federal forest lands.
How will expiration of the Yew Act's requirements affect the Pacific yew tree?
There should be little impact on the Pacific yew resulting from expiration of the Act's requirements.
However, yew resources which would otherwise be harmed or destroyed by land management activities can now be made available to others, including bark harvesters.
The amount of yew demanded for traditional uses of yew is very small and little if any yew outside of project areas is likely to be sold.
Should a large demand develop for medicinal purposes again, yew will be managed in accordance with the Pacific Yew EIS.
In this event, however, the EIS will need to be reviewed to determine if a supplemental or new EIS is necessary, since its implementation period ended in September 1997.
What has been your management policy regarding Pacific yew?
The Forest Service's recent policy regarding yew has been to follow directions in the Pacific Yew EIS for yew bark harvests or to follow resource management plans for other uses of yew.
No Pacific yew resources have been sold from Forest Service administered lands for taxol since the fall of 1993.
The BLM's recent policy regarding yew has been to avoid cutting or damaging the trees when and wherever reasonably possible.
BLM has not sold any Pacific yew resources since the fall of 1993.
Will you be treating the Pacific yew differently now that the Act's requirements have expired?
Management of the yew is not likely to change with the expiration of the Act's requirements.
Initially, management of yew resources will be guided by existing agency resource plans and policies.
Specific management direction may be developed should a clear need arise.
What measures will be taken to ensure the continued existence of Pacific Yew?
Standards and guidelines in current agency resource management plans ensure the continued existence of yew through ecosystem-based management practices.
The Northwest Forest Plan, implemented in April 1994, established several land designations, including riparian reserves, late-successional reserves, and managed late-successional areas.
Together with other administratively and Congressionally withdrawn areas, these land designations provide vast areas across a broad landscape for the species to thrive.
- Does Pacific yew have any use besides providing taxol from the bark?
Though demand has been low, there is a wide variety of traditional uses for yew.
These include wood crafting, musical instruments, archery, wood turning, furniture, native American uses, and fence posts.
For all practical purposes, the Act prevented access to yew resources on Federal lands by traditional users.
- Are other pharmaceutical companies interested in buying Federal Pacific yew for taxol?
There have been no formal inquiries of the BLM or Forest Service expressing an interest in purchasing yew bark for medicinal purposes.
A southern Oregon bark harvester informed BLM in April 1996, however, that they were interested in purchasing yew bark from BLM when the Act's requirements expire.
- Now that yew bark is no longer being harvested from Federal lands, what is the source of taxol?
Bristol-Myers Squibb developed an alternative, semi-synthetic source of taxol from the foliage of European yew trees in 1994.
- How much yew was harvested for taxol?
Yew bark was sold by BLM and the Forest Service for taxol from trees within existing and planned timber sales areas.
The number of trees harvested is unknown.
About 445,000 pounds of dry yew bark were harvested from BLM administered lands between 1991 and 1993.
More than two million pounds of dry yew bark were harvested from National Forest lands during the same period.
Much of the yew bark was purchased directly from purchasers of timber sales who owned rights to harvest the yew.
There have not been any harvests of yew bark from BLM or Forest Service lands for taxol since 1993.
- Is Pacific yew endangered?
No.
A petition was made to list the Pacific yew as an endangered species in 1991.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found no basis for listing the species.
- How much yew is left on Federal lands?
In 1992, the Forest Service Completed a comprehensive inventory of existing Pacific yew located in portions of seven National Forests in Region 6.
In Oregon and Washington there is estimated to be 41 million yew trees, over one inch in diameter, scattered across 7.8 million acres of National Forest land.
A comprehensive inventory of Pacific yew was also conducted in 1992 on BLM administered lands in western Oregon.
The results indicate more than 10.5 million yew trees, saplings, and seedlings are on these lands.
Yew harvesting subsequent to the inventory had little effect on the overall population of yew.
