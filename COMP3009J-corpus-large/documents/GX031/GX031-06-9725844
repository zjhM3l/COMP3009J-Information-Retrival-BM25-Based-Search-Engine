Ryton Rural Interchange
The Ryton rural bus interchange was built because 40 percent of households in Western Gateshead are without a car, which resulted in long journey times to main centers of Newcastle.
The existing system had confusing bus service patterns and there was generally a lack of public transport in the rural areas.
The solution was to build an interchange center that provides access to the trunk bus lines.
It is a staffed facility providing a safe and secure waiting facility 24 hours per day, and also uses CCTV.
It offers real-time traveler information and a flexible bus and minibus service serving the Ryton interchange from rural areas.
Through ticketing is provided for all trips even if the passengers use different bus companies.
Subsidies for taxis are available if a passenger is stranded.
The project was funded through a grant from the national government.
The system also encourages the use of bicycles by providing storage lockers.
