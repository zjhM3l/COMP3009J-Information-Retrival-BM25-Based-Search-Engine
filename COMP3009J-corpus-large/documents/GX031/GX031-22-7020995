This is 24 percent more than the final utilization of last season and three percent more than the previous record high 244.0 million boxes in 1997-98.
The total is divided into the early-midseason-Navel forecast of 137.0 million boxes and the late season (Valencia) forecast of 115.0 million boxes, also a record.
All forecasts are based on tree inventory, fruit counts, and fruit measurements made by the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
Analysis of these factors projects the quantity of fruit to be utilized during the season, including less than two percent for non-certified use.
There has been no measurable amount of economic abandonment of oranges and none is anticipated this season.
During the past 10 seasons, the October all orange forecast has differed from final utilization by an average of 3.6 percent.
Seasonal differences range from 9.4 percent below in 1999-00 to 7.5 percent above in 2000-01.
October forecasts in four of the 10 seasons have been above and six below final production.
Weather conditions have been typical with the exception of above average rainfall all year.
Because of the high rainfall totals (record amounts in some areas), trees are in excellent condition with multiple flushes of new growth observed all summer.
Tropical storms moving around and through the State brought heavy rainfall, but no damaging winds.
In the heavy soils and flatwoods areas, growers have been successfully moving excess water away from tree roots.
Less than one percent of the fruit counted for the forecast is of a non-regular bloom size and shape.
forecast of 1.4 million boxes is 100,000 boxes or eight percent above last season's utilization of 1.3 million boxes.
If attained, this would equal the freeze affected 1989-90 harvest with only two seasons lower.
Estimated bearing tree numbers are down nine percent from last season as growers replace trees with more desirable varieties.
Average fruit per tree increased 22 percent from last season.
Current fruit size is larger than average and rate of growth has been above average this summer.
Size at harvest is expected to be larger than the average.
Droppage rates are expected to be near normal levels at 10.5 percent.
TANGELOS 1.3 MILLION BOXES
The estimated tangelo harvest of 1.3 million boxes is down 45 percent from last season and would the smallest harvest since the 1965-66 season.
Bearing trees are down over six percent and average fruit per tree is down 52 percent.
Possibly because of the above average rainfall, trees seemed to flush with new growth instead of blooming and setting fruit.
Average fruit sizes are large at this time because of the light fruit set and are expected to be larger than average at harvest.
For the same reason, fruit droppage is expected to be less than average.
Expected gift fruit shipments under the 6-R program, and non-certified usage, 2003-04 season
Bearing trees include those planted in 2000 and earlier as shown in the 2002 Commercial Citrus Inventory, updated by two seasons of attrition.
These rates are assumed to follow the same trends as those observed between the 2000 and 2002 census periods and reflect the losses from tristeza and other diseases.
This season, 75.9 million trees, or about three percent less than last season, are used to expand fruit counts and measurements.
Current fruit sizes are larger than the 10-season average.
The average fruit per tree from the summer limb count survey is up over 28 percent from last season reflecting the heavy bloom period and excellent weather conditions this year.
Combined with bearing trees, the resulting fruit population is 25 percent greater than last season.
A shift among age groups resulted in an increase in fruit population in all but age 3, trees 9-13 years old, which represent 26 percent of the total.
Age group 4, trees 14-23 years, is expected to produce about 40 percent.
The older trees (age 5) are bearing 26 percent of the total fruit population.
The procedures used in all forecasts are identical with past seasons.
The methodology is described on page six of this report.

FCOJ YIELD 1.55 GALLONS PER BOX
The all orange FCOJ yield projection is 1.55 gallons per box of 42 degrees Brix concentrate.
This is slightly higher than last season's final yield of 1.54 gallons per box as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association.
The record high yield of 1.63 gallons occurred in the 1998-99 season.
A separate projection for fruit going into the early-midseason and late categories will be made in the January release.
All projections of yield assume the processing relationships of recent seasons.
Results of the latest maturity tests are found on pages 3 and 4.

EARLY-MIDSEASONS 137.0 MILLION BOXES
The early-midseason-Navel
forecast is 137.0 million boxes, 22 percent more than harvested last season, and surpassed only by the 140.0 million boxes produced in the 1997-98 season.
It is also seven percent more than the 128.0 million boxes produced in both the 2000-01 and 2001-02 seasons.
Excluding Navels, 32.2 million bearing trees were used in the expansions, down six percent from last season.
Bearing tree numbers have been declining since the 1998-99 season.
The average fruit per tree from the limb count survey (weighted by the 25 cell age/area matrix) is 30 percent more than last season and the highest in over ten years.
There is virtually no off-bloom this season.
The Western area had the highest fruit per tree average followed closely by the Central counties.
Together, these counties represent 65 percent of the total fruit population.
The early portion, mostly Hamlins, represents 84 percent of the early-mid fruit population, the same as last season.
Fruit size in September is larger than the ten season average.
Growth rates from August have been above average because of the abundant rainfall.
It is anticipated these growth rates will continue.
Average size will be larger at harvest than the previous seven, with the exception of last season.
At this size, it is expected that it will take only six more fruit than last season to make a 90 pound equivalent box.
Droppage is low at this time, however the heavy fruit set is expected to lead to average droppage.
Fruit splitting, which would be expected because of the heavy rainfall, has been very low.
Future weather conditions could alter this projection for droppage.

NAVEL ORANGES 5.0 MILLION BOXES
The Navel
forecast is 5.0 million boxes, seven percent less than last season's 5.4 million boxes harvested.
This forecast includes an allocation of 1.0 million boxes for non-certified and gift fruit.
The current forecast is 22 percent less than the record 6.4 million boxes utilized in the 1996-97 season.
The number of bearing trees has been declining since the 1996-97 season and now are estimated at 2.2 million, seven percent less than last season.
Average fruit per tree is 17 percent less than last season and the lowest since the 1999-2000 season.
Fruit sizes are larger than the average and growth rates have been above normal because of the heavy rainfall and low fruit per tree.
Fruit droppage is very low at this time and is expected to remain low all season.
Harvest has begun with limited commercial shipments.
A good portion of this crop is used by fund raising groups.
VALENCIA ORANGES RECORD 115.0 MILLION BOXES
The Valencia
forecast of 115.0 million boxes is a record, surpassing the previous record 104.0 million boxes harvested in the 1997-98 season.
This forecast is 11 percent greater than that season and 26 percent more than the 91.0 million boxes harvested last season.
Estimated bearing tree numbers are down slightly at 41.6 million compared to 41.7 last season.
A high proportion of the trees planted in the last few years have been Valencias and these trees are now coming into production.
Average fruit per tree increased 31 percent from last season's low level and is the highest average since the 1997-98 season.
The fruit population distribution shows 56 percent of the crop in the Central and Western areas, up from last season's 54 percent.
The Southern area, predominantly the Gulf District, has 32 percent as compared to 33 percent last season.
Even with the high average fruit per tree, current fruit sizes are above the ten year average and the growth rate has also been above normal levels.
Above average rainfall all year has contributed to this excellent growth and fruit sizes at harvest are expected to be above the average.
Droppage rates are very low at this time and are expected to remain low.
Due to the longer time to maturity of Valencias than other orange varieties and weather conditions during the next several months, these fruit size and droppage assumptions could change and alter the expected crop size.
TEMPLES 1.4 MILLION BOXES
The Temple
forecast of 1.4 million boxes is 100,000 boxes or eight percent above last season's utilization of 1.3 million boxes.
If attained, this would equal the freeze affected 1989-90 harvest with only two seasons lower.
Estimated bearing tree numbers are down nine percent from last season as growers replace trees with more desirable varieties.
Average fruit per tree increased 22 percent from last season.
Current fruit size is larger than average and rate of growth has been above average this summer.
Size at harvest is expected to be larger than the average.
Droppage rates are expected to be near normal levels at 10.5 percent.
TANGELOS 1.3 MILLION BOXES
The estimated tangelo harvest of 1.3 million boxes is down 45 percent from last season and would the smallest harvest since the 1965-66 season.
Bearing trees are down over six percent and average fruit per tree is down 52 percent.
Possibly because of the above average rainfall, trees seemed to flush with new growth instead of blooming and setting fruit.
Average fruit sizes are large at this time because of the light fruit set and are expected to be larger than average at harvest.
For the same reason, fruit droppage is expected to be less than average.

MATURITY
Results of the second maturity tests of the 2003-04 season for all but the late oranges, which were tested for the first time, are to the left.
Samples tested are from groves on routes which cover all five major citrus producing areas.
Sample size for all types have remained constant for the past several seasons.
The grapefruit sample size was 100 at the start of this season, which included 50 samples each for the white and colored seedless types.
Only one colored sample was picked by October 1.
None of 325 orange samples had been harvested.
Samples were collected September 29-30 and tested at the Orlando test laboratory of the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
Only regular bloom fruit is collected and tested.
Rainfall throughout the growing season has been above normal levels in all areas.
Lower interior and coastal areas have received more than the upper interior with some recording stations showing two or three times average for the year.
Adverse effects on trees and fruit has been minimal.
In comparison to previous seasons, acid levels are very low, and the lowest for early and Valencia oranges in the ten year series.
Acid in midseason fruit is second lowest in the series, surpassing only last season.
Grapefruit acid levels are near last season at this time, which was also relatively low.
The ratio of solids to acid are the highest in the ten season series for early and Valencia oranges and second for midseasons.
Similar to last season, grapefruit ratios are also high for this time of year.
This indicates advanced maturity levels in comparison to other seasons.
Fresh fruit packers opened in mid-September.
Varieties being shipped include early oranges, early tangerines, and grapefruit.

ALL GRAPEFRUIT 42.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of grapefruit for certified utilization (including an allocation of 1.5 million boxes of gift fruit and local sales) is 42.0 million boxes.
If attained, this will be nine percent more than the 38.7 million boxes utilized last season.
It will, however, be the second lowest amount since the freeze affected 1989-90 season when 35.7 million boxes were harvested.
White grapefruit is forecast at 17.0 million boxes and colored varieties at 25.0 million.

At the request of the Citrus Crop Estimates Advisory Committee, in any season in which economic abandonment of a portion of the crop is anticipated, an estimate of that amount is reported.
With this season's forecast four million boxes below the previous five-season average utilization, no economic abandonment is anticipated.
Changing economic conditions or assumptions during the season may warrant a reevaluation of this projection.

This season's bearing tree numbers include trees planted in 2000 and earlier.
Attrition rates, calculated using the 2000 and 2002 editions of the Commercial Citrus Inventory, were used as a guide and applied to last season's estimated tree numbers.
High rates of attrition are continuing due to disease, abandonment, and urbanization.
White grapefruit bearing tree numbers continue to decline as very few new groves are being planted.
Estimated white seedless tree numbers used in the forecast model declined 12 percent from last season to 3.333 million.
Average fruit per tree (fruit set) increased 25 percent from last season to 497.
Average fruit sizes are anticipated to be larger than average, but smaller than last season.
Growth rates have been above average in the summer months due to the abundance of rainfall.
Droppage rates to harvest are anticipated near normal at nine percent.
Colored grapefruit bearing tree numbers are estimated at 5.461 million.
This is 14 percent less than the trees used in last season's forecast model.
As with white grapefruit, observed attrition continues at a high rate.
Average fruit per tree increased 30 percent from last season to 503 and is above the previous five- season average of 451.
Fruit sizes are slightly above average at this time and are projected to be slightly above average at harvest.
As with white grapefruit, rates of growth during the summer have been above average.
Droppage is projected at 10.5 percent, near the average of the last ten seasons.

All citrus forecasts except seedy grapefruit are based on actual fruit counts and measurements.
These objective count methods utilize: (1) the bearing age tree population provided from the latest aerial photography with field verifications, (2) the average fruit per tree obtained from the fruit count survey using randomly selected trees and limbs, and (3) the fruit measurement and fruit drop count surveys to determine fruit sizes and loss from fruit droppage.
The latest Commercial Citrus Inventory is the base used to determine forecast tree numbers for this season.
All trees planted in 2000 and earlier are included.
An attrition factor by age and area was applied to these base numbers to account for tree losses since the inventory period.
The same unbiased fruit count procedures were used as in all of the past 46 seasons.
These include drawing the sample with known probabilities from the Commercial Citrus Inventory based on analyses of the variability in fruit per tree.
Using random path procedures, count limbs on sample trees are preselected to improve accuracy.
Fruit on these limbs is counted in the mid-July to mid-September period.
Fruit size surveys were conducted in August and September.
The fruit loss surveys (drop count) were begun in August.
These surveys, along with historical records, were used to project the fruit size at harvest and the fruit population that is expected to remain on trees at harvest.
The chart below describes the relationship of the September 2003 early and midseason orange (excluding Navels) fruit size measurements with those taken in September 2002.
The diameter measurements shown are the minimum values of each eighth inch range, except for the smallest values.

Size frequency distributions developed from the September size survey are shown in the following table.
The distributions are by percent of fruit falling within the size range of each 4/5-bushel container.
These frequency distributions relate to fruit from regular bloom and exclude summer bloom in all years.
