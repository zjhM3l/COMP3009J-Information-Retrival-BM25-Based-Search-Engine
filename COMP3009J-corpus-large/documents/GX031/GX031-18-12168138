The forecast is made up of early and midseason oranges (including Navels) at 113.0 million boxes and late type (Valencia) oranges at 86.0 million boxes.
In the past 10 seasons, the March all orange forecast has differed from the final recorded utilization by an average of 1.5 percent, with only three seasons above the final.
The weather conditions for Florida citrus in February were generally beneficial to the current crop.
There were no freezing temperatures in major producing areas and the average temperatures were moderate.
However, average rainfall was below normal and required caretakers to make extensive use of irrigation.

EARLY-MIDSEASON ORANGES
STAY AT 113.0 MILLION BOXES The forecast of the early and midseason oranges is carried forward at 113.0 million boxes.
Volume utilization of this fruit is over and the declining estimated recorded utilization indicates that less than 2 percent of the forecast was left for harvest as of March 3, 2003.
The Row Count conducted on February 26-27 indicated about that amount of harvestable rows remaining.
There may be some revisions of use when the last several weeks become final.
The Navel portion remains at 5.5 million boxes.
The Row Count survey showed over 5 percent of the rows remaining, however complete harvest may not occur.
VALENCIAS
REMAIN AT 86.0 MILLION BOXES The late type (Valencia) orange forecast at 86.0 million boxes is maintained.
The average fruit size from the February survey decreased slightly from the level attained in January and lowered the projection slightly .
However, the average fruit size is still the largest of the record that goes back to 1960.
The average loss from fruit droppage from sample trees in February increased at a lesser rate than the preceding months, but the level is still at the greatest loss factor in the preceding 10 seasons.

FCOJ YIELD NOW 1.55 GALLONS
The all orange FCOJ yield projection is lowered from 1.57 to 1.55 gallons per box of 42.0 degrees Brix concentrate.
This level is lower than the past two seasons when the all orange yield was 1.58 gallons per box.
The early and midseason portion is currently at 1.491993 as of March 7 which was the last report from the Florida Citrus Processors Association.
The projection of yield for Valencia oranges going into FCOJ has also been lowered to 1.65 gallons per box from 1.67.
These projections of yield assume the processing relationships of the past several seasons will be similar this year.
Weather and harvest patterns can also have an influence on the final yields.
The Maturity Test Results are on page 3 of this report for the remaining Valencias.

GRAPEFRUIT REMAINS AT 40.0 MILLION BOXES The forecast of all grapefruit for certified utilization (including a preseason allocation of 1.5 million boxes for gift fruit and local sales) is continued at 40.0 million boxes.
Category breakdown remains unchanged at 16.0 million boxes of white varieties and 24.0 million colored.
This forecast is 5 percent below the initial October forecast which was lowered to the current level in the December report.
February measurements of fruit size indicate the advanced harvest of both white and colored categories.
More samples than usual had been harvested before the survey period.
Average fruit sizes did not increase, indicating harvest of the most desirable sizes for fresh utilization.
Droppage rates on the remaining samples continued to increase, although only slightly on white seedless but heavier on colored varieties.
Size measurements in January (considered final month for expansion purposes) averaged higher than all but one season in the historical ten season series for white seedless and all but two for colored.
Both categories were larger in the summer months than the ten season averages but cooler winter weather moderated growth rates.
Droppage rates for whites were average in the summer months and remained so for the season but colored, which started higher in the summer and fall months and continued high, ended the season about one percent above the average.
Estimated utilization to March 1 for fresh use is ahead of the previous two seasons for colored varieties but behind for white.
Exports have been strong this season while domestic shipments have lagged.
Utilization by processors has been above one million boxes weekly the entire month of February and consists of packinghouse eliminations and direct to processor fruit.
The route survey (Row Count) conducted February 26-27 indicates over 50 percent of the white grapefruit and over 60 percent of the colored grapefruit rows harvested.
These figures are higher than those of the previous 6 seasons and fully support the forecast.

EARLY TANGERINES STAY AT 3.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of early season tangerines (Fallglo and Sunburst varieties only) is continued at 3.0 million boxes.
Harvest is virtually complete with limited amounts being delivered to processors.
This season's harvest is 31 percent less than the 4.35 million boxes harvested in the previous season which included only about 100,000 boxes of the Robinson and Dancy varieties.
HONEY TANGERINES CONTINUED AT 2.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of late season Honey tangerines is continued at 2.0 million boxes.
Fruit sizes remain near the ten season average after having started the season larger than any size in the 10 year series.
Droppage rates started the season below average and continue slightly below the average which is about 40 percent.
Fresh shipments have been advanced as packers harvested in anticipation of cold weather in January and remain above the level of the previous two seasons.
TEMPLES REMAIN AT 1.4 MILLION BOXES
The Temple forecast is continued at 1.4 million boxes.
This is 10 percent less than the 1.55 million boxes utilized last season.
If the forecast is realized, it will equal the second smallest crop on record which occurred in the freeze damaged 1989-90 season.
Average Temple fruit size is larger than any in the ten season series.
Fruit droppage is above average although following a normal pattern.
Fresh shipments have declined to the lowest levels on record.
Most of the remaining crops will be harvested for processing use.
TANGELOS HELD AT 2.4 MILLION BOXES
The tangelo forecast is continued at 2.4 million boxes, the same as the initial forecast in October.
Utilization of tangelos has been more complete this season with the most fruit processed since the 1998-99 season.
Fresh shipments however, continue to decline.
The route survey indicates some rows having fruit available for harvest.
Weekly processing movement has continued but is declining as warm weather affects the usability of the remaining crops.

FRUIT SIZE COMPARISONS BY TYPES TO PREVIOUS SEASONS
Size frequency distributions from the February size survey are shown in the table below.
The distributions are by percent of fruit falling within the size range of each 4/5-bushel container.
Fruit sizes were measured on trees in sample groves during the period February 13 through 28, 2003.
Comparable sizes for 2001 and 2002 are also shown.
These measurements are of fruit from spring bloom and exclude summer bloom in all seasons.
