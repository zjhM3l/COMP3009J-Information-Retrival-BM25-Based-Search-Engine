Content Standard D: Earth and Space Science
Grades K-4: + Properties of earth materials:
+ earth materials are solid rocks and soils; water, and the gases of the atmosphere; the materials have different physical and chemical properties; earth materials provide many of the resources that humans use; + soils have properties of color and texture, capacity to retain water, and ability to support the growth of many kinds of plants, including those in our food supply; + fossils provide evidence about the plants and animals that lived long ago and the nature of the environment at that time;
Objects in the sky:
+ the sun, moon, starts, clouds, birds, and airplanes all have properties, locations, and movements that can be observed and described; + the sun provides the light and heat necessary to maintain the temperature of the earth;
Changes in earth and sky
+ the surface of the earth changes, some changes are due to slow processes, such as erosion and weathering, and some changes are due to rapid processes, such as landslides, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes; + weather changes from day to day and over the seasons.
Weather can be described by measurable quantities such as temperature, wind direction and speed, and precipitation; + Objects in the sky have patterns of movement.
Grades 5-8:
+ Structure of the earth system:
+ the solid earth is layered with a lithosphere; hot, convecting mantle; and dense, metallic core; + lithospheric plates on the scales of continents and oceans constantly move at rates of centimeters per year in response to movements in the mantle.
Major geological events, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building, result from these plate motions; + land forms are the result of a combination of constructive and destructive forces.
Constructive forces include curstal deformation, volcanic eruption, and deposition of sediment, while destructive forces include weathering and erosion; + some changes in the solid earth can be described as the "rock cycle"... + soil consists of weathered rocks and decomposed organic material from dead plants, animals, and bacteria.
Soils are often found in layers, with each having a different chemical composition and texture; + water, which covers the majority of the earth's surface, circulates through the crust, oceans, and atmosphere in what is known as the "water cycle"... + water is a solvent.
As it passes through the water cycle it dissolves minerals and gases and carries them to the oceans; + the atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases that include water vapor.
The atmosphere has different properties at different elevations; + clouds, formed by the condensation of water vapor, affect weather and climate; + global patterns of atmospheric movement influence local weather.
Oceans have a major effect on climate, because water in the oceans holds a large amount of heat; + living organisms have played many roles in the earth system, including affecting the composition of the atmosphere, producing some types of rocks, and contributing to the weathering of rocks.
Earth's history:
+ the earth processes we see today, including erosion, movement of lithospheric plates, and changes in atmospheric composition, are similar to those that occurred in the past.
Earth history is also influenced by occasional catastrophes, such as the impact of an asteroid or comet; + fossils provide important evidence of how life and environmental conditions have changed;
Earth in the solar system:
+ the earth is the third planet from the sun in a system that includes the moon, the sun, eight other planets and their moons, and smaller objects, such as asteroids and comets.
The sun, an average star, is the central and largest body in the solar system; + most objects in the solar system are in regular and predictable motion.
Those motions explain such phenomena as the day, the year, phases of the moon, and eclipses; + Gravity is the force that keeps planets in orbit around the sun and governs the rest of the motion in the solar system.
Gravity alone holds us to the earth's surface and explains the phenomena of the tides; + the sun is the major source of energy for phenomena on the earth's surface, such as growth of plants, winds, ocean currents, and the water cycle.
Seasons result from variations in the amount of the sun's energy hitting the surface, due to the tilt of the earth's rotation on it's axis and the length of the day.
Grades 9-12:
+ Energy in the earth system
+ earth systems have internal and external sources of energy, both of which create heat; + the outward transfer of earth's internal heat drives convection circulation in the mantle that propels the plates comprising earth's surface across the face of the globe; + heating of earth's surface and atmosphere by the sun drives convection within the atmosphere and oceans, producing winds and ocean currents; + global climate is determined by energy transfer from the sun at and near the earth's surface.
This energy transfer is influenced by dynamic processes such as cloud cover and the earth's rotation, and static conditions such as the position of mountain ranges and oceans
Geochemical cycles
+ the earth is a system containing essentially a fixed amount of each stable chemical atom or element.
Each element can exist in several different chemical reservoirs... + movement of matter between reservoirs is driven by the earth's internal and external sources of energy.
These movements are often accompanied by a change in the physical and chemical properties of the matter.
Origin and evolution of the earth system
+ the sun, the earth, and the rest of the solar system formed from a nebular cloud of dust and gas 4.6 billion years ago.
The early earth was very different from the planet we live on today; + geologic time can be estimated by observing rock sequences and using fossils to correlate the sequences at various locations.
Current methods include using the known decay rates of radioactive isotopes present in rocks to measure the time since the rock was formed; + interactions among the solid earth, the oceans, the atmosphere, and organisms have resulted in the ongoing evolution of the earth system; changes are on a human time scale and other take place over hundreds of millions of years; + evidence for one-celled forms of life - the bacteria - extends back more than 3.5 billion years.
The evolution of life caused dramatic changes in the composition of the earth's atmosphere, which did not originally contain oxygen.
Origin and evolution of the universe
+ the origin of the universe remains one of the greatest questions in science, the big bang theory...; + early in the history of the universe, matter, primarily the light atoms hydrogen and helium, clumped together by gravitational attraction to form countless trillion of stars.
Billions of galaxies, each of which is a gravitationally bound cluster of billions of stars, now form most of the visible mass in the universe; + stars produce energy from nuclear reactions, primarily the fusion of hydrogen to form helium.
These and other processes in stars have led to the formation of all the other elements.
