But,neverthelass,A great site....Steve.
6/23/2002 Your web site is a very handy place to find info about the Hubble telescope.
Thank you.
6/23/2002 I live in Baltimore Md and the information about the telescope is hard to get.
There is very little published information.
6/22/2002 Id like to know if you have found a Nebula Galaxy combination that exsibits an exstream range of hues. 6/22/2002 This site is great, it helped me with my project, and I found a lot of usefull information from this site.
The only problem for me - it was long time utill I reach this site.
Thanks! 6/20/2002 the hubble telescope is one of the greatest adventures for man kind,its for the moment the closest we will get to interstellar travelling.
GeGe, La France 6/14/2002 I AM A CUSTODIAN IN THE PGH. PA. PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND AT RECENT GRADUATION.
I MENTIONED A PICTURE I SAW A YEAR OR SO AGO OF A RING OF MAN MADE SATELLITES SURROUNDING THE EARTH YOU DISPLAYED, I BELEIVE TAKEN BY THE HUBBELL CAMERA.
SHE WOULD LIKE TO SHOW THIS TO HER 4th and 5th GRADER'S AND ASK ME IF I COULD AGAIN LOCATE A COPY OR THE WEBB ADDRESS.
IF POSSIBLE YOU HAVE MY RETURN E-MAIL ADDRESS, GOD BLESS. ps.
I BELEIVE I GOT IT FROM THE HOME PAGE THAT SHOW THE SYMBOLS OF OUR STRATEGIC DEFENSE COMMAND AGENCIES, AND WILL UNDERSTAND IF NOT AVAILABLE GIVEN RECENT WORLD EVENTS.
THANKS.
6/14/2002 this is a brilliant site, though I would love to see more artist's impressions.
6/14/2002 I have been interested in the space program since I first heard about Sputnik.
I was just a little guy.
I admire the courage the astronauts have and keep in touch via the news on every mission.We have only had our computer less than a year,but we have Hubble pics. on our screen saver.After last year, a lot of things changed.But my hope is that mankind will onward and upward like our space program.
GODSPEED to all of you,and us as well.
6/13/2002 When we look deeply at nature, we begin to understand the amazing world around us.
The Hubble Project has so extended our view of nature and the scale of the universe - this is one of the greatest achievements of our civilization.
Lisa M. Randlette 6/13/2002 Thank you for such a great website! The pictures are amazing.
My screen saver is made up of several images from your site! The Hubble Project is something we can all be proud of.
You are all doing a great job! Thank you! 6/13/2002 Dear sir can i see the photo of sun 6/10/2002 Am 8i years old and never dreamed I would ever see any thing like this in my lifetime.
INcredible, a fitting farewell! 6/10/2002 It is so interesting to learn about the stuff u put on the web site 6/7/2002 I have come to your site in order to find information for an undergraduate paper I am doing.
I am particularly interested in information on research being done regarding new ideas on the age of the universe based on the latest photographic findings of the Hubble.
Did the Big Bang take place much longer ago that we thought up to now? Nice job on the site.
It's been very helpful.
RJ 6/6/2002 I have the hubble image screen saver on my computer.
I think it and the people who operate the hubble are awe some.
You can't get any better than this.Keep up the great work.
6/6/2002 These new shots are absolutely breath-taking; awe-inspiring.
I have some others which are quite spectacular as screen savers.
I often purposely let my PC set idle so I can watch them.
6/6/2002 FIRST THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL WEB SIGHT..
IS IT POSSIBLE TO SEE THE SPACE STATION FROM EARTH, AND WHERE WOULD WE HAVE TO LOOK AND WITH WHAT? THE HUBBLE SCREENSAVERS THAT ARE ON MY COMPUTER ARE OUTSTANDING AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR SHARING 6/6/2002 Absolutely beautiful website.
The entire Hubble Project just blows me away.
Don't change a thing.
You are now esconced in FAVORITES.
Thank you Jim Joyce.
6/6/2002 I wish I had come here before.
6/6/2002 I WISH TO ADD ONE OTHER COMMENT: THIS EXPOSURE TO OUR YOUTH CAN ONLY INCOURAGE THEM TO SEEK FURTHER ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEMS AHEAD; ESPECIALLY THE MANY, AND DIVERSE, RELIGIONS THAT HAVE CAUSED ALL WARS IN ALL THE LANDS.
OUR YOUTH IS OUR HOPE TO RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THEIR FOREFATHERS AND THIS SCIENCE CAN ONLY SHOW THEM LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES.
6/6/2002 IT IS SO INSPIRING TO SEE, ON ANY LEVEL, BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION.
THIS IS SO EXCITING.
AND TO THINK, THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THEIR "GOD" WILL DESTROY THEIR ENEMIES.
CONGRADULATIONS! YOU ARE FANTASTIC.
6/6/2002 As an amatuer astronamer I am ecstatic to see what you have done with everything as far as images of space 6/6/2002 THE PICTURES I SAW FROM THE HUBBLE WERE BREATH TAKING I PRAY YOU KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK FOR OUR COUTRY AMERICA ANN GARITE 6/6/2002 This is awesome, now that you have the new technology, there will be so much more information that you may recieve.
I usually go onto the web, but this is honestly the first time I have looked around, (I usually just go to games).
This is really cool, I am so excited, (as you can tell, I keep repeating that its so cool.)
My grandfather worked for NASA awhile ago.
Nowlin B. Theilacker, and I guess I got the love for science from him.
Please send me any new finds.
I would greatly appreciate it.

6/6/2002 hi this is the greatist source of info i ever dreamed of... id like to com here again.im a biginner in astronomy and i love the hubble the most .please help me start my first introduction into space reserch. i am mike petrin.
6/6/2002 What awesome pictures !!! I think you are THE GHREATEST !!! 6/5/2002 Hubble is one of the greatest achievements of ALL time It must be a great feeling to be a part of it! I once wrote an impromtu essay of our own choosing for freshman English class in 1946 at ISU (Idaho)-at that time I, too, wondered "How Vast Our Universe"-the title of my essay-I only wish I had kept it-would you believe the lady professor gave me an "F"-thinking I had somehow plagurized the essay-I was bashful, but I would not back down-she gave me a "D"!! No spelling or grammar erros (I was good at that)I have not forgotten it, but in essence this helps people to understand-how far does a supposedly straight line extend-infinity _I would say unles time is basiclly curved! Thanks listening.
I am a pharmacist by profession-age 74-but we are never too old to be charmed by Hubble 
6/5/2002 Very interesting site.
I do not understand why photographs are not presented in common formats.
Many do not use power point, for instance, but nearly everyone has BMP or JPEG capability.
Are you tryinbg to sell other programs? 6/5/2002 I am so glad to see the new Hubble photos.
They are worth it whatever the cost! 6/5/2002 I think that it is wonderful to be able to explore space and have the incredible pictures available for public view.
I was wondering if the Hubble is ever turned toward the earth for a much closer view? Love the website.
6/5/2002 I'm just so happy that this site exists.
I've downloaded a few pictures and placed them in frames.
Great stuff.
Thank you.
6/5/2002 Incredible images! 6/4/2002 great job scary to think there could be life keep up the good work 6/3/2002 u are doing just fine to bad we have no amateur radios on board TNX Paul 6/2/2002 The Hubble space program is an ingenious way to view the universe but is needs to be redeveloped with a "StarTrek scanning device" of some kind if we are to find other life beyond our knowledge.
May the way to understanding the universe come to us through the images of the Hubble space telescope.
5/28/2002 hi all you science fans out there im james or science wiss as they call me im always exsperimeting with animales i even create my own robots , but some times i uncover things i didnt exspect. nasa your cool i study you every day , your the reason i whent into the field of science.
i research with my own teliscope and some day i hope to join nasa and disighn new types of craft and new tech to help our boys in space 5/28/2002 Hi its a very good site Regards BFM http://www.designerbibel.com 5/28/2002 Your web site is a very handy place to find info about the telescope HUBBLE.
Thankyou.
5/27/2002 Great sight - still much to look at - I would recommend it to be used in schools who wish to learn about our solar system and beyond.
Keep it going - as the internet continues to grow I am sure that the site will become an ever increasing source of reference.
5/27/2002 Very cool.
5/27/2002 Cool site.
5/25/2002 I live in Baltimore Md and the information about the telescope is hard to get.
There is very little published information.
5/23/2002 Mynamekhurramnadeem. iamveryinterstedofspacenasailikethiswebsid.
5/18/2002 Absolutley beautiful.
I also am amazed by the brilliance of the people who have created this wonderful machine.
5/17/2002 im looking for some good pictures of space and i cant find any.
would you be able to send me some good pic's of jupitar 5/15/2002 did you know that in about 50 millon years from now phobos one of marses moons will smash into it and also jupiter can support life its just the temputeres are always changing and the storms stir every thing up so life would not be able to form an that there might be another plant because a nother planet might have pulled pluto witch was one of neptunes moons away causing it to be a planet 5/15/2002 i am a species of great knowlage i am from solar system beta we taped in as you would say to write this message ..
you homo sapians or human beings that are sending those signals tring to contact us is realy pointless... yes we arer out here you proble think i am pranking you but i have been watching you and its hard to learn all your languages and know how to spell words good buy for now and i expect contact from you 5/13/2002 I found all of the information that I needed in one trip! No coming back, to get more.
5/12/2002 Ich kann glass essen und das tut mir nicht weh! 5/12/2002 Sniffle....you guys deleted my inspirational messages.
I dont think i can go on through life knowing that nasa thinks that what i write is a piece of crap....thanks guys.
I just wanted to share with the world a message of hope, and you had to ruin it! I dont think i can go on anymore.
Laugh all you want at this....but remeber, never let disgruntled penguins into your house....
5/12/2002 This is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you all :) Awsome, just awsome 5/11/2002 sorry, has somone seen the LORD ? I know, that 666 is not longer alone.
God bless you all Manni, the sun 5/9/2002 does anybody else see lots of faces lots of clear faces 5/9/2002 yuor webb site is sweet i did a project on it and i got 100% cuz i got all the info here it really helped alot thanxxxxxxx a million guys but there is one thing that i really really want to know about it.who invented it but oh well i guess it is to bad so sad well g2g x0x0x0x0x luv youssssssss +*+KaTiE+*+ 5/6/2002 I am doing a report on the Hubble Space Telescope and I want to know a little more info on it.
For example, I want to know what it looks like, what it does, who built it, who came up with the idea, etc. 5/6/2002 When one looks at the breathtaking images of the distant pass and realize the before of humankind or any kind, how amazing we(the entire planet)are here at all.
That all the horrors of mankind will pass away and we are truely wasting our moment in time.
What we should be doing is love one another and be kind.
One can not see these images and not be touched.....The secondary reason is the inventions that we have enjoyed as a by product.I and my family are fans of NASA and try to visit Houston every few years..Thank you and keep on keeping on! 5/5/2002 I i'm very thankfull and enjoy greatly this awsome web site.The hubble spacecraft is much more than i amagined. thanks NASA.
5/5/2002 information is great..need more pictures though.
5/5/2002 sir i want to know how black hole is work 5/4/2002 great site !!! one of my favorites 5/3/2002 Great job.
Please repair the "Pan 
Thanks.
5/2/2002 Much better photographs on the web than in the newspaper! Thank you.
5/2/2002 do you think the reason why we float is space among the stars is because we are made of stars and we are at Home? 5/2/2002 I hear there is great interest in finding or confirming ice on MARS. why dont they focus the Hubble at its poles?also i never read about aiming the Hubble at our planets.WHY?i would think with the new camara,the hubble would get a clear picture of MARS ice or "ice bubbles" on its surface .....please respond........subject.."ICE HUBBLE" 5/1/2002 Ladies and Gentilmen -- You all are doing a great job.
The imagery is tremendous.
Keep up your great work.
I look forward to more images and interpretations in the near future.
5/1/2002 From a web designers point of view, your site is great!!! First-rate design and easy to find what I want.
Also, thank you for putting this site online.
Ive followed NASA and other space projects ever since Apollo.
With The Hubble Telescope and its upgrades we can now see even further into space.
Looking at the wonderful photos that Hubble has taken, one has to look at our little planet and ask the question: All this is out there and yet some still think we are alone?...yeah right.
4/30/2002 Nice site Pity the Links to the pics don't work maybe they should host them on thier OWN servers 4/30/2002 I sure did enjoy this site.
My husband forwarded it to me.
I love astronomy but am dyslexic and a poor math and science student.So, basically I look at the wonderful pics and read the explanations to go along with them.
Hubble was worth every dollar spent to build it.
The universe is beautiful and marvelous isn't it? I still wonder how any of you could doubt that there's a Creator.
The Creator is a mathematician of the highest order.
Thanks for the great work guys.
4/30/2002 just visiting the site think its great,kids really like it you need more advertisement i like showing them the suits and gloves which i'm helping make back here in Delaware ( ILC) Keep those Ships flying Thanks Donna A. 4/30/2002 The new Hubble photographs are awesome, and I appreciate what is being learned from this project.
There are still so many theories, educated ones I know, but does anyone have a theory as to where this universe ends? One cannot help looking at the beautiful sky at night and wondering -- why is this and what is it? Thank you.
4/30/2002 i like the pictures the hubbles space telescope have taken.
I did a project in this too.
Hope u all will take pictures beyond 500 miles in to space.
4/30/2002 You are giving us the most fascinating information that I have seen.
Keep it coming.
4/30/2002 Yhis is the first time I hve been on your website.I am from Marshfield Missouri.Does that town ring a bell?We have a smaller version of the Hubble on our courthouse lawn.I am related to Mr. Hubble areal distant relative and we here in Marshfield are so proud.Who would think that a genius would come from a town with three thousand people in it.My twin sons are into astronomy one in paticular.He has a casagran telescope and is out looking and finding some things.I just thought I would let you know we are proud to be from here and that the Hubble is doing great things.Thanks for all the pictures.I am sure my son will be letting you know what he has found.He is 22 years old and is going to college to study the heavens.Thanh you Angie Powers 4/30/2002 Good work on getting these images out into the public.
Its nice to know that the Hubble project is not the debacle that many Democrats claim it to be.
4/30/2002 WOW. 4/30/2002 I just sent an email.
However, as an avid star gazer and ameture astronomy nerd, I have fallen in love with the latest technology that Nasa has developed.
I am also a teacher and students now-a-days have technology only greatly available in video games and TV documentaries.
However, I believe that astronomy is the wave of the future and my students will need to know more about it and hopefully most of them will work in the field of astronomy if not Nasa.
Thank you for allowing my students to be able to see all that I discuss in class.
I think it may hook some of them for years and years to come! 4/30/2002 It's utterly fantastic.
It's worth every penny of the tax payers money.
4/30/2002 Great photographs of a majestic universe and that is putting it mildly! The big bang theory? These beautiful things look like they have perfect order and were put there by a Creator.
When a big bang, or explosion occurs, nothing is in order but there is nothing but shambles and chaos.
Our whole universe has a perfect order to it, something that did not just come from a big bang.
It takes more faith to believe that this all was caused by a big bang than it does to believe in a Creator.
I choose to believe in a Creator! 4/30/2002 Ever since I saw the first photos taken by the Hubble telescope, I've been hooked.
Once I could, I went on the Web to see the changes in the Trifid Nebula in November 1999,when two of the stars collided.
Outstanding! I can never get enough! Even though the vastness of our universe is way beyond my understanding, I love seeing the photos because I'll never have the chance to see any of them in person.I guess my fascination with space travel began back in the '50s with Walt Disney's "Tomorrowland."
What a visionary he was.
Thanks for showing NASA's work on the net.
It's beyond words! sooz 4/29/2002 Hi! i am 14 years old and i want to be work with Nasa one day..i'm Turkish.And i believe UFOs.(And Nasa knows) I was watched the Navada desert on Discovery channel.....
4/28/2002 A very nice site.
Good work guys.
4/26/2002 The Hubble STS-109 crew is coming to Balt Sci center next Tue afternoon ! Will they be available on center at GSFC or accross the street that day or period also ? Dick 4/26/2002 this website help on a report for science, but i just couldnt find who helped design it and if there were any telescopes better than the hubble.
4/26/2002 Hi, a very nice site about the Hubble Space telescope.
I love it.
Visit my Page: djgreg 4/26/2002 I would be very glad about a very big spaceship, which takes some people to the Mars, to make them live there!!! 4/26/2002 Hi, I am very interested in the Hubble and in space generally.
So I searched in Google the word Hubble, and wow I found about 2000 Sites which are interesting, but this one is really the most exciting one.
Webdesign 4/20/2002 where is my time on the hubble how do i use the hubble if i can not get access to it.
who do i email for my time on the telescope, where is my 5 hours on the hubble i requsted for a 360 of space and did not get to see it.
and at mutple powers.
thank you janet 4/20/2002 I am nearly 70 years old and what I have seen in my lifetime is an incredible journey in itself.
These images are so beautiful that they are almost surreal.
Thank you NASA for bringing this information and these photographs into my home.
Please come visit my Website at www.Kansasoz.com and take a look at my journey through the "Wizard of Oz," a part of my life as a cast member when I was a child.
4/18/2002 Why can't you send a big Ship that can hold enought fuel to make it to mars and find other spieces 4/18/2002 Hello, now I have a question...
And to me it makes since, Now with the 'Hubble Telescope' you can see into the far reaches of space and see very distant Galexy's then why don't you look at are nearest star and try to see if you can see other planets and stuff? Sincerly Link P.S.
Could you E-mail me your responce cause I found this website on accident and I probaly will not be able to find it again.
4/17/2002 You're all doing fabulous work.
4/16/2002 This site is great, it helped me with a huge project that I had to do for class.
Thanks! 4/15/2002 Hi! I am studying The Hubble Telescope in school, and allthough I just started, all my information so far is from this site! But I still have one question, if you were not quite in space yet, but you were in the air, and it started to rain really hard, and it was a big thunder storm, what would you do? Sincereley, Natalie (age 8) 4/15/2002 This site is O.k. althought it did not help me much with my project! 4/15/2002 the hubble is great but it would be better if you could see the pictures more clear maybe you could get a new lens or try to get further away so pepole on the internet looking at the pictures could see them better.thanks for being understanding age 11 4/13/2002 Hi , my name is Arne and i search for informations about the satelits who could see whats new in the galaxy or in the worl. please dont be angry because i am 14 and i am from germany . please write me an e-mail with informations about the satelit and if i could look into the galaxy,live. best wisches arne 4/11/2002 Thanks for the great work.
Am fascinated with the information on the universe and beyond.
The pictures are informative and interesting, the facts are intriguing.
Glad this work is being done.
4/8/2002 It's all good.
Really enjoyed the site.
4/8/2002 I was just looking on the aol and thought i would look up nasa site was really surprised to find it.
I have a 8th grader who is studing the solar system in science and he realy enjoys finding information on it.
I was really little when we landed on the moon.
Keep up the great work and i hope our nasa keeps getting all the support it needs.
It`s all new to us rather when been up there more then 10 times.
Ever mission is a little different and new.
Good luck always 4/5/2002 Hi, I just wanted to know about the "Hubble Sees Bare Neutron Star Streaking Across Space" image you got on the gallery.
I have this particular question: For what do the different dates stan for? Like 6 oct 1996 30 march 1999 16 sept 1999 It will be awesome if you can email me back! And congratulations for working in something so intresting and important! 4/5/2002 I AM LOOKING FOR THE IMAGE, "EARTHLIGHTS" TAKEN LAST NOVEMBER.
I HAVE THE SITE WITH APOD AND CANNOT RETRIEVE IT.
WOULD LIKE TO GET MAIL FROM YOUR SITE.
PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD MY ADDRESS.
THANKS! 4/4/2002 I am in the Nasa Endavour Program.
I am ttrying to find out about the hubble telescope.
Our problem is the insulation problem that happened a few years back.
4/3/2002 love to watch hubble go round the world 4/3/2002 absolutley fantastic site, keep up the good work 4/1/2002 Thanks for an informative and useable site.
3/31/2002 Love your web site.
Are we allowed to visit your facility? Mason 3/31/2002 Thank You! Veryu helpful for my school project! 3/27/2002 I like it all and I appriciate the site Thank you so much 3/26/2002 i am a grade nine student at stellys school in victoria B.C.
Canada you probably got my classes email today from Mr. Stoddart.
but anyway i think your web site is neat but there is one thing that would be neat but i dont know if you could do it.
if you could hook up a live web cam to see everything that the actual telescope can see and i also like all the live cams you have.
thanks 3/19/2002 i am amazed beyond belief,thanks in advance for all of this 3/19/2002 Today is March 19:time;17:27 hours,mst.
Have been attempting to get some information as to the status of the telescope and its instrumentation: Is it now being tested;if so, to what extent.
Would greatly enjoy information as what is now being done and what is scheduled for the immediate future.
3/19/2002 hey! u guys r great!! i think u guys have come very far in this experiment.
i think that the people that wrote the rude things like "u guys suck!!" was very unnecessary.
they r the kind of people that dont care about their home (earth). i think it is awesome how we can look at our universe without even leaving earth.
well, hope we get even farther in the hubble. have fun!!! your friend, Amanda 3/19/2002 i think your website is great!! it gives a lot of info. i went into it for my earth science class and i liked it. i like the pic's.
3/14/2002 the hubble lanched the 25th of march in 1990! 3/14/2002 are you in school? 3/14/2002 How Long has the hubble been in space? I would like to have some intresting facys in about two minutes.
3/14/2002 i was wondering if you dould send a whole load opf interresting facts in two minutes.
3/13/2002 Very anxious to see first pics after the SM3B! When will we get to see them? 3/12/2002 Gee, I'm glad Hubble is now upgraded, and can see way farther than it used to be able to.
It's too bad the scientists hord the pictures.
Who cares about astronauts floating around a satellite.
Show us the pictures this multi-million dollar telescope is getting! 3/12/2002 I just wanted to let you know that I have been watching the upgrade of the HST, and have very much enjoyed it.
I hope to be able to see the return of our Astronauts tomorrow morning via NASA TV.
I have been trying to catch each space walk during the tenure of this flight.
I just wanted to let you know how exciting this has been for me.
I am looking forward to seeing some interesting new views of space from the newly upgraded HST.
I had a tear in my eye the other night as I watched the release of that magnificent observatory from the shuttle.
It is just totally amazing to me, that in my 41 yrs. on this planet, that we have come so far.
Keep up the good work.
GO NASA!!! If the clouds don't obscure my view, I hope to be able to see the Shuttle re-entry tomorrow morning.
3/11/2002 Dear space dudes, hi.how are you?i was just wandering around and found out about that thing out in space.Its really cool.well just wanted to send some quick mail bye.
Grace 3/11/2002 I think nasa is doing a great jod in thier work on the hubble telescope and the shuttle missions in the pass year.
Me and my fellow class mates are makin and lauching our own mini rockets at school.
and your sites have help us alot.Thanks!! u 3/10/2002 how do i get to see pictures from hubble, enter the coords and so on and i get back a list of numbers that do not show me the picture of space for that cood. thank you. fix it or tell us what to do after we input all that stuff,like why not just joystick us threw all that data, and return the peg to our web page.
3/9/2002 When will you get your first new photo from Hubble, 
Congratulations, Pau MercadÃ© 3/7/2002 GO HUBBLE!!! 3/7/2002 Hello 3/7/2002 It is fantastic to be able to see images live from the space.
Thank you.
3/6/2002 Its Good! But there needs to be more info on whats going on in space at the moment 3/6/2002 What A great site you have going, and it is very easy to use! If you have the opportunity to do so, please take a look at my new informative site at loans-and-mortgages.org.
I hope that if you ever need an FHA home loan, debt consolidation loan, or an affordable mortgage - you come to my site! ~ Enrique Orojo, Baja Nuevo, NM USA 3/6/2002 Just watched y'all in the SOTTC on NASA TV ... sounds like the power-up is going well - great work you guys! I just read Hubble (hardware) engineers have Apple Titanium PowerBooks now, but I didn't see any laptops in SOTTC - if you've got one, wave it at the camera next time! Best regards... 3/6/2002 Hi hope you fix it soon 3/5/2002 I THINK ALL OF YOU ARE DOING A TERRIFIC JOB! IS THERE SOMEWHERE ON YOUR SITE WHERE I CAN SEE THE VIDEO OF THE LATEST LAUNCH? THANK YOU, KIM 3/4/2002 I just wanted to say that Mike massimino is the KOOLEST person.
Good luck to all of the crew members and FOR the only woman up there ( im not sure of your name)GO GIRLS WE ROCK!!!!!!! 3/4/2002 You're doing a great job! Keep up the good work.
Is there a DVD that contains these images? 3/4/2002 you guys are stupid! 3/4/2002 This web site is great!! :) 3/3/2002 I want to know, if it will be possible to see the Hubble-Pictures in the Internet? 3/1/2002 Hello I wrote to you earlier and forgot to give you my home address in case you would like to send me something.
My home address is: 8688 SW 158 PL Miami, Fl 33193 Thank you! ~~~Lourdes Cuervo~~~ 3/1/2002 I am a teacher in an elementary gifted classroom.
My students and I have been studying about the Hubble Space Telescope, and we want to know if you have any information you can send us regarding Servicing Mission 3B.
The students loved the sticker and I was wondering if you could send me sixty more if possible.

2/17/2002 Good webpage you have here, and best greetings to you all And You Are --
Why don't you share the glory? 2/11/2002 Congratulations NASA on the Hubble project.
Im 17 and since I was seven years old, I have wanted to be the first woman on Mars.
I have been to 5 space camps in all and loved every single one of them.
When I get through with college, I'm hoping to persue a job at NASA.
Keep up the good work.
~Courtney (future astronaut) 2/7/2002 I'm a CIS instructor at a Community College and love to send my Internet students to your site -- just to hear the "Wow's".
2/7/2002 Thanks to Roxanne Paul, age 12, of Cherry Hill, NJ, I was made aware of the availability of this site.
She has earned my congratulations and I hope she will continue this work.
Thanks again, Roxy! (http://www.jerseytransit.com/roxy.htm) 2/7/2002 Lots of information here for anyone to read.
Marvelous! 2/6/2002 I can remember when we were kids, we would lay on the beach at night and try to find and name the constellations.
Another activity taken away by the TV.
I was fascinated by your article in the Popular Science of June '01 2/5/2002 A REALLY ABSORBING SITE YOU HAVE ME HOOKED ON SPACE, MUST DO MORE ON THE AMATEUR RADIO SIDE. 1/30/2002 this is a greatsite 1/28/2002 Wow.
Pretty cool.
All i thought of it to be was a piece of metal floating in space now i know it is alot more than that.
I am doing a project about it and would recomend this site for its info. 1/27/2002 Very good and informative HST site 1/27/2002 Jag tycker att det Ã¤r spÃ¤nande att med hubbel kan se sÃ¥ lÃ¥ngt back i tiden lycka till 1/25/2002 Hubble is to the 90s generation as the Mercury an Apollo missions were to my generation.
It is one of those missions that everyone can get behind.
It has been easy for me, because I am still in love with all of the space programs.
This site has been great for me to explore some other aspects of the upcoming missions.
Keep up the good work! 1/24/2002 Hi,I am Melissa Barreto, I am 9 years old.
I am a student in MIAMI,FL.
I love space and in the future I want to be an austranaut and go to the moon.
Congratulacions for working for NASA , and I really think you are intelligent.
Can i ask you a question? How does it fell being in space? How does the earth looks out in space?How do you have to get ready and prepaird to go to the moon? 1/24/2002 Hey! I just come to this website because I had to see how they built the hubble telescope! It was my assignment.
1/21/2002 I have a question about the Hubble.
Suppose you point the HST at a particular point in space, but during every orbit around Earth, the target point is hidden by the Earth.
How does Hubble compensate for the times when Earth is in the way of it's view? thanks James Furr 1/16/2002 I think that what NASA is attempting to do with the Hubble Telescope is excellent.
If this mission is successful, which it will be, it will afford us many more excellent opportunities to look into our past and predict about the future, so the more information we can obtain on it the better.
I also love this website because it is very insightful.
Also, the very nature of space flight is exciting and almost unbelieveable to me.
It has interested me for a long time and will continue to-- probably forever! 1/16/2002 the hubble space telescope is soooo cool. i want to learn more about it.
are there any books i could read? 1/13/2002 Excellent web site! Thank you so much for the time and effort that everyone has put into this project.
We appreciate it very much also that you share thee information with us.
Charles Abney 1/12/2002 We never should have stopped reaching for the Star's after Apollo,if anything, We should have redoubled our effort's.
The dissapointment that we didnt is assuaged by the work being done with Hubble, and by the work being done by all the other's involved in space research.
Please keep up the good work..............Rick 1/9/2002 Are there working Dutch people working whit the NASA??? Give them ''de groeten''.
1/9/2002 Hello, I live in the Netherlands and i am not very good in english.
But I am very interested in looking to planets and stars and all that stuf.
