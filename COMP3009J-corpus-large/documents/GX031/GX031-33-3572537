Under the NAFTA, the United States is to provide total access for raw and refined sugar from Mexico of 25,000 metric tons, raw value, for this quota period in conjunction with Mexico's net surplus producer status.
The 25,000 metric tons, raw value, of raw cane sugar allocated to Mexico pursuant to the NAFTA are subject to the condition that the total imports of raw and refined sugar from Mexico, combined, are not to exceed 25,000 metric tons raw value.
The allocations of the raw sugar tariff-rate quota to countries that are net importers of sugar are conditioned on receipt of the appropriate verifications.
Conversion factor: 1 metric ton = 1.10231125 short tons.
United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky announced the country allocations for the refined sugar and sugar-containing products tariff-rate quotas on October 1, 1999 (USTR Press Release 99-82) and published notice of the country allocations for those quotas in the Federal Register on October 7, 1999 (Federal Register Volume 61, Number 1941, page 54719).
