{short description of image} CIVIL AIR PATROL HISTORY AND MISSIONS AN AVIATION ORIENTED ORGANIZATION FOR MEN, WOMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS redline _________________________________________________________________ Welcome to the history/missions page of the Civil Air Patrol Aerospace Education Web Site.
My name is Lt. Col. Peter Morris.
I am the commander of Group 1 which includes all Search and Rescue Squadrons in southern, Arizona.
I have been chosen to be your guide for a brief tour of the history of the Civil Air Patrol.
Welcome Aboard!.
The Civil Air Patrol was organized on December 1, 1941, as part of the U.S. Office of Civilian Defense.
During World War II, its members provided orientation flights to thousands of prospective aviation cadets and recruits.
Members flew more than 24 million miles on coastal patrol.
They summoned help for 91 ships in distress and 363 survivors of submarine attacks.
Patrol crews spotted 173 enemy submarines, dropped bombs or depth charges on 57 of them and received credit for sinking or seriously damaging at least two.
Others were destroyed by planes and ships summoned by Civil Air Patrol radios.
Civil Air Patrol crews flew many other wartime missions, including a courier service for airlift of personnel and light cargo; target-towing and tracking flights for training anti-aircraft gunners; power line and pipeline surveillance; forest fire patrol; and patrol along the southern U.S. border.
Sixty-four members died while performing wartime operations.
The organization became a permanent peacetime institution on July 1, 1946.
On that date, President Harry S. Truman signed Public Law 476 of the 79th Congress, incorporating Civil air Patrol in its present form.
Civil Air Patrol became a permanent civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force in May 1948 with the enactment of Public Law 557 of the 80th Congress.
MISSIONS
.
ORGANIZATION
Civil Air Patrol has a national headquarters at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and eight geographical regions, each with from five to nine wings.
There are 52 wings in all, one in each state plus Puerto Rico and the district of Columbia.

The national executive committee, which consists of the same members as the national board minus the 52 wing commanders, meets at least twice a year.
The committee conducts most of the patrol's affairs.
The executive director, who manages the day-to-day affairs of the organization at the national level, is an Air Force general officer named by the secretary of the Air Force.
The director has a staff of Air Force military and civilian personnel, known as Headquarters, CAP-USAF, which serves as a staff at Civil Air Patrol National Headquarters, serving in an advisory capacity.
They are assigned to Air Training command.
In addition, some 78 officers, 78 airmen and 16 civilians, all Air Force personnel, are assigned to the 60 regional and wing offices for liaison duty with Civil Air Patrol.
They provide advice and help the patrol perform its missions.
PERSONNEL
Civil Air Patrol has about 60,000 volunteer members.
They include nearly 23,000 teenage cadets.
They wear a uniform similar to that of the Air Force but with special Civil Air Patrol insignia.
Members fly some 6,800 privately owned aircraft and more than 600 aircraft owned by Civil Air Patrol.
they drive some 1,700 trucks, jeeps, ambulances and sedans.
They also maintain licensed short-wave radio stations as part of a network of fixed, mobile and airborne systems across the nation.
Nearly 12,000 senior members are FAA-licensed pilots.
Thousands more are qualified observers and fly on various civil Air Patrol missions.
Time served in Civil Air Patrol does not count toward military service-nor does it obligate members to any active military duty.
AIR FORCE ASSISTANCE
Besides providing an executive director and liaison officials, the Air Force provides equipment from Department of Defense excess items.
Examples include aircraft and spare parts, motor vehicles, office supplies, communications equipment, rescue equipment and training aids.
When it is possible, the Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve provide airlift for many Civil Air Patrol Programs and, less often, for cadet orientation flights.
Air Force and other DOD agency housing, , medical and dining facilities, classrooms, offices, dining aids and teachers are also provided to insure the success of Civil Air Patrol summer encampments.

EMERGENCY SERVICES This is the Civil Air Patrol's best know activity.
It entails air search and rescue, local disaster relief, as well as cooperation with the assistance to civil defense agencies.
Civil Air Patrol members fly three out of every four hours flown on search and rescue missions directed by the Air Force Rescue and Coordination Center at Scott Air Force Base, Ill.
The center coordinates search and rescue efforts within the inland search and rescue region (48 contiguous states).
Civil Air Patrol is also active in Alaska where it is directed in its search operations by the Alaskan Air Command Rescue Coordination Center.
In Hawaii, the patrol works under the direction of the Pacific Air Forces Joint Rescue Coordination Center.
In Puerto Rico, Civil Air Patrol works in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard and local civil authorities.
In the last five years, Civil Air Patrol crews have been involved in nearly 5,000 search and rescue or other emergency service missions.
during this time, these volunteers were credited with saving the lives of approximately 400 persons and with locating the objects of their searches nearly 2,500 times.
These missions required more than 91,000 hours of flying time.
Civil Air Patrol, as well as members who fly their own airplanes on these missions, are reimbursed by the Air Force for fuel, oil and communications expenses.
In addition, the air force now provides some reimbursement for maintenance costs for these as well as for certain authorized training missions.
Often, Civil Air Patrol members also help out in disaster relief work as well as search and rescue.
These missions may involve airlifting blood, medication and civil or relief officials to disaster areas.
The missions may also involve air surveillance of disaster areas, as well as the air evacuation of the stranded, sick or injured.
Rescue work and aid are provided during floods, hurricanes and other emergencies
Civil Air Patrol also maintains a nationwide network of short-wave radio stations.
The network provides an invaluable backup to state and local civil defense communications.
Locally, the stations support state disaster plans includes Civil Air Patrol communications, search and rescue and other disaster relief missions.
AEROSPACE EDUCATION
Civil Air Patrol aerospace education programs help inform the public about air and space matters.
Over the past 30 years, Civil Air Patrol has supported about 4,000 aerospace education workshops for teachers and education officials at more than 250 colleges and universities around the country.
these programs have prepared nearly 200,000 teachers to teach aerospace education courses in their schools or to use information on these subjects to enrich the usual classroom subjects.
Other important services offered to the educational community include assistance in curriculum planning at all levels and educational materials for use by teachers in their classrooms.
Civil Air Patrol's Center for Aerospace Education Development develops, publishes and distributes materials to teachers.
These materials range from pamphlets and activity booklets to a complete high school elective course.
They are produced and sold at cost far below commercially available products.
Civil Air Patrol keeps in close contact with education departments at all levels and with agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Air and Space Museum and the Air Force Association.
these contacts promote and expand aerospace education in the nations schools.
Also, the patrol provides yearly scholarship funds to cadet and senior members.
These funds help finance college studies in engineering, the humanities, education, science and other fields relating to air and space.
THE CIVIL AIR PATROL CADET PROGRAM
The cadet program is designed to inspire the country's youth to become leaders and dynamic American citizens through an interest in flying.
Young men and women who are American citizens or permanent residents may become Civil Air Patrol cadets and participate in the cadet program.
They must have completed the sixth grade or be at least 13 years old to become members.
The maximum age for entering the cadet program is 18.
Cadets take part in a number of programmed and special activities.
From these they develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to understand the total impact of air and space operations on society.
They learn discipline by studying leadership and by learning military drill and courtesies.
They face critical issues of the times through discussion and debate, and they become and remain physically fit through a special physical training program.
Through studies and other activities, cadets work their way through a series of 15 achievements.
As cadets progress, they earn increased rank, ribbons or certificates.
They also become eligible for nationally sponsored special activities and may compete for academic scholarships.
Cadets are assigned to squadrons staffed by senior members who guide and assist them through the program.
A popular activity is the flying program.
It promotes an interest in aviation by providing orientation flights and scholarships to cover flight training through solo qualification.
The most sought-after activity of advanced cadets is the International Air Cadet Exchange.
Each summer, about 160 cadets and their adult escorts travel to one or the other of some 20 foreign countries.
In return, cadets from foreign lands visit the United States as guests of Civil Air Patrol and the Air Force.
Such trips promote goodwill and understanding among the world's youth who share a common interest in aviation.
Additional activities include cadet summer encampments at more than 50 U.S. military bases and a cadet officer school.
there are also familiarization courses at Air Training command bases, para-rescue training, survival training and cadet competitions.
SENIOR MEMBER TRAINING
The senior member training program is a five-level, structured training and education program designed to prepare seniors to accomplish Civil Air Patrol's missions by filling leadership positions and performing specific functions within each unit.
Adult members can learn about flight and air navigation, public affairs and first aid.
Initial training includes aerospace concepts and moral leadership.
Later, senior members can upgrade their skills through officer training and home study courses.
These cover writing and speaking, principles of learning, methods of managing and teaching and related subjects
