BSE is one of several known animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies including transmissible mink encephalopathy, scrapie, chronic wasting disease of mule deer, and elk, and feline spongiform encephalopathy.
The disease name refers to the fact that at the end of the disease, the brain is full of holes like a sponge.
The disease may develop in a relatively short time or, as is more usual, will take decades to develop.
Scrapie may be the most well known of the spongiform encephalopathies.
It occurs in sheep and goats.
In general, as in cattle, diseased animals lose coordination of their legs and body movements and eventually cannot stand.
The name "scrapie" refers to the fact that the animals can become irritable and develop an intense itch.
The unrelenting itch leads them to "scrape" off their wool/fur.
Although the majority of the information in this resource is on BSE, the publication covers the recent information on all these diseases as they may affect human health, farm animals and wildlife species.
There are also human conditions that are similar to the animal diseases.
In most cases the human diseases are not due to transmissible agents.
They can be genetic diseases that run in families, a mutation that happens sporadically in individuals and probably animals as well, or they may be transmitted by ingestion of the infectious agent (e.g. kuru of the Fore people was caused by ritualized cannibalism).
There is still some controversy regarding the nature of the transmissible agent that causes these fatal conditions, but the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified form of a normal cell surface component known as a prion (proteinaceous infectious articles and (pronounced preeon) protein) (PrP).
This modified version of PrP is disease causing, and is both less soluble and more resistant to enzyme degradation then the normal protein.
"Currently there is no known treatment for prion diseases, and the fear that prions passed from cattle to humans may be justified."
^1
Dr. Prusiner to humans may be justified."
^1 "also states that "prions appear to multiply in an incredible way: they convert normal protein molecules into dangerous ones (PrPsc) simply by inducing the benign molecules to change their shape."
"There are hints that the prions causing the diseases " such as BSE and scrapie "may not be the only ones.
Prions made of different proteins may contribute to other neurogenerative diseases that are quite prevalent in humans."
It is the transmissible possibilities of the infectious agent moving between animal species and between animals and humans via an oral route that is currently of greatest concern.

Prion diseases: epidemiology in man.
APMIS Acta Pathologica, Microbiologica, et Immunologica Scandinavica 2002 Jan; 110(1): 14-22 ISSN: 0903-4641.
Abstract: Prion disease in man was first described as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in the 1920s.
CJD may have three different origins: sporadic, familial, due to mutations in the prion gene, or infectious, due to iatrogenic exposure to infectious brain material.
As an example of the latter, kuru, in Papua New Guinea, was a variant of CJD transmitted by cannibalism.
Between 1957 and 1982 more than 2500 died of kuru.
Sporadic CJD is the most common form of CJD and occurs with an incidence of around one per million in most parts of the world.
Familial CJD accounts for approximately 10% of all European cases of CJD, and is associated with inherited mutations of the prion protein gene, caused by one of the 24 single amino acid substitutions or insertions of octapeptide repeats.
CJD caused by infections involves either iatrogenic cases of CJD, resulting from exposure to infectious brain, pituitary or ocular tissue, or from ingestion of infected food items.
As of today, a few hundred iatrogenic cases of CJD have been diagnosed worldwide, the majority due to transmission by cadaveric pituitary HCG.
So far, 111 cases of vCJD have been diagnosed caused by BSE-contaminated food.
The size of the epidemic is still unclear and worst-case scenarios indicate that we may expect many thousands of cases in the future.

Abstract: The astute observation by William Hadlow, an American veterinary neuropathologist of the similarity between the histopathology of kuru, an obscure disease of the primitive tribe in New Guinea, and scrapie of sheep, was the first clue to the etiology of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE).
The knowledge that scrapie was transmissible but only after an unusually long incubation period, that the causative agent was highly resistant to heat and formalin, and that it seemed to be able to replicate in the absence of nucleic acid, eventually led to the discovery of the prion by Stanley Pruisner and the still controversial protein-only hypothesis of etiology of the TSE.

2002 May; 104(2): 77-86 ISSN: 0303-8467 Abstract: The protein-only theory of transmission of the prion diseases remains controversial.
Other mechanisms such as the virus, virino, and viroid hypotheses are still under consideration.
All these fit in the concept of 'slow' infections that had been proposed in 1954 by Bjorn Sigurdsson, an Icelandic pathologist.
Regardless of the exact mode of infection, the presence of prions in the brain has served to unite Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia, as well as scrapie and a number of other animal diseases, into a single pathological entity, the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
In contrast to the classical form of the disease, nvCJD affects younger patients, presents a relatively longer duration of illness and is caused by the same agent as BSE.
Evidence from laboratory studies now strongly supports the hypothesis that new variant represents human form of animal disease, linked to exposure, probably through food, to bovine prions.
Number of BSE reports in the United Kingdom began to decline in 1993, and has continuously decreased year by year since then, but a great worry spread in European countries in association with new BSE reported cases outside of the Great Britain, and increasing incidence of nvCJD.
New epidemiological, clinical, histopathological and experimental data on prion diseases are reviewed, focusing our attention on the possible transmission of prion proteins from animals to humans.

51(3-4): 245-257 ISSN: 0167-5877 Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of tracing and compliance encountered in setting up and maintaining a UK-wide 5-year observational study of beef cattle.
The 5-year prospective study was initiated in 1997 to investigate the occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a single herd of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle, in which BSE had been detected at low prevalence.
The study was given the acronym ULiSES (University of Liverpool Spongiform Encephalopathy Scheme).
All cattle present on the farm at the start of the scheme were registered as members of the study population (n=320), as were all calves standard histopathological techniques) for the presence of spongiform change.
Remaining samples were stored at -70 degrees C for future investigation by alternative tests.
At the halfway point of the scheme in October 1999, 75.2% (506/673) of the study population was still alive; 42% (284) of the population was still alive on the study farm and 33% (222) was distributed on other farms throughout the UK.
Complete sets of specimens had been recovered from 77% (129/167) of dead animals.
All brainstem sections were negative by histopathological examination.
No suspect cases of BSE were reported in ULiSES animals.
Failure to recover specimens occurred principally in animals which had left the study farm.
The main cause of specimen loss was a failure of compliance in a small number of individuals who had purchased large numbers of ULiSES animals, and subsequently slaughtered them without contacting the University.
Despite this, farmer compliance was generally high.
The ULiSES scheme shows the feasibility of a country-wide longitudinal observational study spanning a period of several years and indicates the large impact of small numbers of non-compliant individuals.

24: 519-550 ISSN: 0147-006X Abstract: Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative conditions that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie in animals.
Prions appear to be composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of a host-encoded glycoprotein, prion protein.
Prion propagation involves recruitment of host cellular prion protein, composed primarily of alpha-helical structure, into a disease specific isoform rich in beta-sheet structure.
The existence of multiple prion strains has been difficult to explain in terms of a protein-only infections agent, but recent studies suggest that strain specific phenotypes can be encoded by different prion protein conformations and glycosylation patterns.
The ability of a protein to encode phenotypic information has important biological implications.
The appearance of a novel human prion disease, variant CJD, and the clear experimental evidence that it is caused by exposure to BSE has highlighted the need to understand the molecular basis of prion propagation, pathogenesis, and the barriers limiting intermammalian transmission.
It is unclear if a large epidemic of variant CJD will occur in the years ahead.

2001 Sep. 12(9): 729-733 ISSN: 0938-8990 Abstract: The doppel protein (Dpl) is a prion-like protein encoded by the gene PRND, which has been found downstream of the prion gene, PRNP, in human and mouse.
This paper describes the isolation and structural organization of the bovine and ovine PRND genes, which are composed of two exons compared with the three of human and mouse.
Intergenic distances between PRNP and PRND were covered by means of long-range PCR and found to be 16.8 and 20 kb, in cattle and sheep respectively.
The 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) were analyzed to identify transcription regulatory sequences and compared with those from the PRND and PRNP sequences published for other species.
Three polymorphisms (R50H, N110H, and R132Q) were revealed in the cattle coding region; two synonymous substitutions (I12I, A26A) were found in sheep.
None of the polymorphisms was significantly associated with either Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle or scrapie in sheep.

2001 Feb. 12(2): 150-156 ISSN: 0938-8990 Abstract: A novel gene, rasfadin (RASSF2) was identified close to the bovine prion gene, and its genomic structure was derived with a combination of exon trapping and RACE.
The gene covers at least 28 kb and maps to the same chromosomal region as the prion gene in cattle, sheep, and human.
The RASSF2 ORF is composed of 987 base pairs divided into nine exons and shows a high nucleotide (88%) and amino acid similarity (95%) with a previously described human cDNA, KIAA0168.
The bovine 3'UTR region is significantly shorter than the human counterpart, but shares with it two highly conserved nucleotide blocks.
The expression of the gene was investigated in brain, liver, and spleen.
Alternative splicing yields a shorter product in the liver composed of only four exons.
Computer analysis showed a highly significant similarity of the rasfadin protein with the Ras association (Ral-GDS/AF-6) domain family 2 and with the afadin family, respectively, for the longer brain/spleen and the shorter liver variants.

Abstract:
Reporting of clinically suspect cattle is currently the most commonly used method world-wide to detect BSE cases.
The effectiveness of mandatory reporting depends on a variety of factors; for other diseases passive surveillance underestimates the incidence of clinical cases.
The efficiency of passive surveillance systems for BSE will remain unknown until screening tests able to identify clinically affected cattle have been applied in several countries.
This paper provides the first detailed description of a targeted screening programme for BSE.
Two populations of cows 
Between 1992 and 1999, on average 81 clinical BSE suspects per year were reported to the veterinary authorities (passive surveillance), of which 43% were confirmed with BSE.
A total of 30 clinical cases were captured by passive surveillance and an additional 20 BSE cases detected by targeted screening between May 1999 and April 2000.
The odds of finding a BSE case was 49 times higher in the fallen stock and 58 times higher in emergency-slaughtered cattle when compared to passive surveillance.
The targeted screening of fallen stock and emergency-slaughtered cattle considerably increased the number of detected cases in this 12-month period.
Targeted-screening cases were on average 4 months younger than the clinical suspect cases.
In conclusion, post-mortem testing of fallen stock and emergency-slaughtered cows 
Without ante-mortem screening tests to detect BSE-infected cattle during the incubation period, a combination of effectively functioning passive and active BSE surveillance strategies might be the only approach to assess the BSE situation reliably in a given country or region - and it is necessary to substantiate claims of freedom from the disease.

Abstract: This paper compares the clinical signs, histopathology, detection of PrPSc protein and PrP genetics of the transmission of BSE to sheep and goats, with the effects of the transmission of natural scrapie from a brain homogenate from a single sheep.
After intracerebral and oral inoculations there were similarities in the clinical signs due to the two sources of infection, but there were differences in pathology at the end stage of disease and in the genotypes of the sheep which succumbed to the challenges.
The incubation period of BSE was associated with the sheep PrP codon 171 genotype, but the natural scrapie source, despite inducing disease only in known susceptible genotypes, showed no clear association with PrP genotype.

2001 Oct. 82(Pt 10): 2319-2326 ISSN: 0022-1317 Abstract: This study has examined the distribution of PrP(Sc) in sheep by immunocytochemistry of tissues recovered from terminally affected animals following their experimental infection by the oral route with BSE.
Despite a wide range of incubation period lengths, affected sheep showed a similar distribution of high levels of PrP(Sc) throughout the central nervous system.
PrP(Sc) was also found in the lymphoid system, including parts of the digestive tract, and some components of the peripheral nervous system.
These abundant PrP(Sc) deposits in sheep in regions outside the central nervous system are in direct contrast with cattle infected with BSE, which show barely detectable levels of PrP(Sc) in peripheral tissues.
A number of genetically susceptible, challenged animals appear to have survived.

ISSN: 0022-1317 Abstract: The diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) depends on the detection of vacuolation in brain sections taken from affected individuals and/or the identification of the disease-associated isoform of the PrP (prion) protein (PrP(Sc)).
During the course of an investigation, goats clinically affected following experimental infection with three different sources of TSE (SSBP/1, CH1641 and BSE) developed widespread vacuolar degeneration in the brain.
With BSE, PrP(Sc) was clearly recognized in affected goat brain by immunocytochemistry (icc) and Western blotting, but in contrast the experimental scrapie sources SSBP/1 and CH1641 showed almost no or very little PrP(Sc) by icc.
Western blot analysis of PrP(Sc) from BSE-affected and SSBP/1-affected goat brain showed that the protein was present in brain affected by both TSE sources, but could not be used to determine how much protein was present.
It became clear that PrP(Sc) and vacuolation could be partially dissociated following challenge with two of the three TSE sources.
Subtle differences in glycosylation patterns between BSE- and SSBP/1-associated PrP protein isoforms could also be recognized, although these experimentally generated results should not be regarded as a BSE/scrapie differential test.
However, our study warns that the reliance on PrP(Sc) determination by icc alone as a means by which to diagnose TSE infection may generate false negative results.

Fournier, J. G. Nonneuronal cellular prion protein.
International Review of Cytology 2001.
208: 121-160 ISSN: 0074-7696 Abstract: The normal cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a membrane sialoglycoprotein of unknown function having the unique property of adopting an abnormal tertiary conformation.
The pathological conformer PrP(sc) would be the agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases.
They include scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.
The conversion of PrP(c) into PrP(sc) in the brain governs the clinical phenotype of the disease.
However, the three-dimensional structure change of PrP(c) can also take place outside the central nervous system, in nonneuronal cells particularly of lymphoid tissue where the agent replicates.
In natural infection, PrP(c) in nonneuronal cells of peripheral extracerebral organs may play a key role as the receptor required to enable the entry of the infectious agent into the host.
In the present review we have undertaken a first evaluation of compelling data concerning the PrP(c)-expressing cells of nonneuronal origin present in cerebral and extracerebral tissues.
The analysis of tissue, cellular, and subcellular localization of PrP(c) may help us better understand the biological function of PrP(c) and provide some information on physiopathological processes underlying prion diseases.

v. 91 (2) p. 191-205.
ISSN: 1364-5072 Abstract: This paper considers the development of microbiological risk assessment models for pathogenic agents in drinking water with particular reference to Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The available evidence suggests that there is potential for considerable variation in exposures to C. parvum oocysts through drinking water, during both outbreak and non-outbreak conditions.
This spatial/temporal heterogeneity arises both from variation in oocyst densities in the raw water and fluctuations in the removal efficiencies of drinking water treatment.
In terms of risk prediction, modeling the variation in doses ingested by individual drinking water consumers is not important if the dose-response curve is linear and the oocysts act independently during infection.
Indeed, the total pathogen loading on the population as represented by the arithmetic mean exposure is sufficient for risk prediction for C. parvum, BSE and other agents of low infectivity, providing the infecting particles (i.e. oocysts or BSE prions) are known to act independently.
However, for more highly infectious agents, such as rotavirus, ignoring the variation and just using the arithmetic mean exposure may over-estimate the risk by a factor of about threefold.
If it were to be shown that pathogens co-operate with each other during initiation of infection, such that the dose-response relationship is non-linear, then modelling the variation in doses ingested by individual consumers would be very important.
Possible mechanisms for co-operation of pathogens during infection are considered.
Simulations show that acquired protective immunity for C. parvum reduces the risk of infection during outbreak conditions by over 10-fold.
Variation in virulence between strains of C. parvum is a further source of uncertainty.

2001 Jan. 124(1): 52-59 ISSN: 0021-9975 Abstract: The histological changes in the brains of 506 clinically normal 7-year-old cattle, which were part of a cohort study on maternal transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, are described.
Vacuolation of the white matter, of unknown aetiology, located particularly in the substantia nigra, was a frequent finding.
Vacuolated neurons were commonly observed in the red nucleus (64.3% of the animals) and in the habenular nucleus (50.1%).
Spheroids were found in 10.8% of the brains, most frequently in the vestibular nuclei.
Cellular inflammatory infiltrates in association with blood vessels occurred in 30% of the animals at various locations in the brain; their aetiology remains uncertain, but they may have reflected subclinical or latent infections.
Mineralization of the wall of blood vessels, with proliferation of the intima, was observed frequently in vessels of the internal capsule and was probably associated with ageing.
The description of histological findings in the brain of symptomless adult cattle in the present study provides a useful background for diagnostic bovine neuropathology.

to humans may be justified."

As of November 2000, in more than 35,000 herds, about 177,500 cases of BSE were confirmed in the UK alone.
For current information, see the website of the Office of International Des Epizooties at http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_esb.htm According to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, BSE has not been detected in the U.S. despite active surveillance efforts since 1990.
^3 Surveillance information is available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/issues/bse/bse-surveillance.html"
Concurrent with the cattle epidemic in the UK has been a rise of a new variant of CJD (NvCJD) in humans.
This form of CJD "predominately affects younger individuals (median age at death 27.5 years as of October 2000), has atypical clinical features, coordination problems within weeks or months, dementia and myoclonus late in the illness, a duration of illness of at least 6 months, and an abnormal brain scan.
There is beginning to be strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal relationship between the NvCJD and BSE.
The absence of confirmed cases of NvCJD in other geographic areas free of BSE supports a causal relationship."
^3
Because of the BSE and NvCJD incidence, the Animal Welfare Information Center decided to provide a science based information resource about these diseases and all other potentially important TSEs.
This resource includes a bibliographic listing of articles and website resources about the disease, the emergence of the disease in the UK and the political and social events surrounding the BSE crisis.
It is a dynamic resource and additional materials on BSE and other TSEs will be added as they are identified.

Abstract: Four strains of mice were inoculated intracerebrally with a primary isolate of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the cloned mouse-adapted scrapie strain ME7.
Clinical prion disease diagnosis was made at the appearance of three or more neurological symptoms and their persistence for 3 consecutive weeks and confirmed by neuropathological criteria.
For BSE, incubation periods were profoundly different between the sexes in all four mouse strains, being longer in the females.
In contrast, ME7 scrapie incubation times were similar between the sexes.
Our results indicate that sex-specific processes are involved in the course of primary BSE transmission.
Research into this phenomenon may provide clues to the prophylaxis of BSE and have possible implications for new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.

Abstract: A survey of the laboratory findings in suspected cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Denmark from 1 June 1990 to 31 December 2000 is presented.
During this period BSE was a notifiable disease, and the heads of suspected cases were submitted according to the legislation on BSE.
A total of 176 submissions were made, mostly from bovines with neurological disorders and mainly during the last 3 years of this period.
Lesions or other laboratory findings consistent with severe neurological disorders were found in 115 cases.
The most frequent diagnosis was encephalic listeriosis (35.8% of submissions) followed by other forms of inflammatory lesions.
A wide range of lesions were diagnosed less prevalent.
BSE was diagnosed twice.
The first case occurred in an imported cow in 1992, while the second confirmed case was diagnosed in a native cow in February 2000.
A marked increase in the number of submissions occurred following the detection of BSE in February 2000.

Abstract: Our understanding of the pathogenesis of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) has made terrific headway over the past 40 years and some scientists are even of the opinion that this group of diseases belongs to the neurodegenerative syndromes best understood.
On the other hand, the investigation of TSE has led to a multitude of unexpected and surprising results and consequently has initiated impassioned discussions among scientists.
Although the human forms of TSE are very rare, the wildfire-like spread of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) raises the pressing question as to whether BSE is communicable to humans.
This overview summarizes some current hypotheses about the nature of the infectious agent and about the pathogenesis of the damage of the central nervous system.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is not known whether variant CJD can be transmitted within the human population by blood transfusion.
The expression of normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) by different blood cell types may permit selective uptake and dissemination of infectivity.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The normal distribution of PrPC on the major blood cell types of species known to be susceptible to natural or experimental transmissible spongiform encephalopathies was studied.
Blood from healthy humans, mice, hamsters, cattle, and sheep was examined by flow cytometry by using a large panel of antibodies with different prion protein (PrP) epitope specificities to maximize the detection of PrP variants across species and cell type.
RESULTS: PrP was detected on all major human blood cells types except eosinophils, but was not detected as ubiquitously or uniformly on major blood cell types of different animal species.
CONCLUSION: Different animal species have unique patterns of expression of PrPC on blood cell types, with none equivalent to the human pattern.
This needs to be considered when extrapolating from animal models of blood-borne transmissible spongiform encephalopathy infectivity, particularly in regard to the risk assessment of potential variant CJD spread within the human population.
The relationship between PrP distribution and infectivity distribution in blood needs further investigation.

Identification of inter-species transmission of prion strains.
Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology.
2002 May; 61(5): 377-83 ISSN: 0022-3069 Journal URL: www.aanp-jnen.com Abstract: The concern of the potential transmission of animal spongiform encephalopathies to humans, which arose as soon as the interspecies transmission of these diseases was recognized, has been reinforced with the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle.
Recent experimental findings suggest that the infectious agent causing BSE in cattle can lead to the occurrence of a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.
These findings help us understand how the transmission to humans of an animal disease may be recognized.
This can involve an indirect approach through the analysis of neurodegeneration, either in the disease host, or more specifically, in genetically well-defined experimental hosts to which the disease can be transmitted.
Recent experimental studies have also shown that the different molecular features of the abnormal form of the prion protein, which accumulates in the infected tissues, can provide important clues to the relationships between different spongiform encephalopathies.
However, a better understanding of the molecular features associated with the specific pathogenic behavior of different strains is required.
Complex relationships between the infectious agents involved in spongiform encephalopathies and the disease host can make the recognition of a link between animal prion strains and the human disease difficult to establish.

Berliner und Munchener Tierarztliche Wochenschrift 2002 Mar-Apr; 115(3-4): 131-3 ISSN: 0005-9366 Abstract: Determination of specified risk material (SRM) in processed meat products was performed by quantification of brain specific fatty acids using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
Results from SMP (internal standardised meat products) based analyses showed that absolute concentrations of CNS are correlated (r2 = 
GC-MS detection limits were measured at 0.01% CNS.
The cut off value was calculated at 0.39% (w/w) CNS in SMP.
In a controlled blindfold experiment we were able to identify correctly all positive and negative SMP samples, respectively.
Our results indicate that GC-MS based SRM detection may serve as a reference method for immunochemical and immunohistochemical determination of SRM in processed meat products.

Validation of a luminescence immunoassay for the detection of PrP(Sc) in brain homogenate.
Journal of Virological Methods.
2002 Mar; 101(1-2): 79-84.
ISSN: 0166-0934.
Abstract: A luminescence immunoassay (LIA) was developed for the diagnosis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in brain tissue using two different monoclonal antibodies for capture and detection of the protease-resistant fragment of the pathological prion protein (PrP27-30).
PrP27-30 currently represents the most reliable marker for the infectious particle (denominated prion) causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).
Internal and official validation studies of this assay are described using brain homogenates from ascertained BSE positive and negative cows.
Using more than 300 positive and 1400 negative bovine or ovine samples, an excellent sensitivity and specificity of 100% were demonstrated.
More than 1000-fold dilutions of a BSE positive homogenate still resulted in a clear positive signal.
In combination with a simple homogenisation procedure for the preparation of the samples, this assay lends itself for large scale screening of cattle and sheep for TSEs using complete automation of the process.

ISSN: 0903-4641 Abstract: The transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy to humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has focused public attention on how prion diseases are transmitted and how prions reach the brain after exposure.
Prion diseases are characterised by transmissibility and neuropathological features of gliosis, neuronal loss and microscopic vacuoles, termed spongiosis.
The principal component of prions is the glycoprotein PrP(Sc), which is a conformational modified isoform of the normal membrane protein PrP(C).
How are prions transmitted and how do prions find their way once they have been ingested? Prion models in mouse and hamster point to lymphoreticular cells which support an early replication phase of prions before reaching the central nervous system via peripheral nerves.
Whilst some key players seem to have been identified so far, the mechanisms of prion propagation to the brain are still not fully understood.
Seemingly contradictory results have led to some confusion and have provoked discussion.

Abstract: In view of the first 64 BSE cases (date: 11.5.01) in German cattle herds an overview on TSE and their similarities and differences regarding clinic, pathogenesis and pathology is given.
The mechanism of the unconventional agent, an infectious protein (prion), is explained based on the prion model of Stanley Prusiner.
The knowledge on transmission, incubation time, host specificity as well as resistance and immunity drawn from experimentally infected animals is discussed.
Thus, after oral infection prions are transported by lymphocytes from the stomach-intestinal tract to the spleen.
The way to the CNS is still unknown.
The presumption for crossing the species barrier is twofold: first the prions of different species have to be biochemically homologous and a genetical disposition has to exist.
This is the case for BSE and the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease (vCJD).
There is evidence that in Great Britain so far 97 (date: 30.3.01) young people acquired vCJD due to consumption of food that contained bovine risk material.
Regarding the infectious prion dosis brain, spinal cord and lymphoid tissues are regarded to be most dangerous.
The principle of the BSE-test, its evidence as well as steps for prevention and control of BSE are presented.

Abstract: Considerable evidence argues that consumption of beef products from cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions causes new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
In an effort to prevent new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, certain "specified offals," including neural and lymphatic tissues, thought to contain high titers of prions have been excluded from foods destined for human consumption [Phillips, N. A., Bridgeman, J. 
Here we report that mouse skeletal muscle can propagate prions and accumulate substantial titers of these pathogens.
We found both high prion titers and the disease-causing isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) in the skeletal muscle of wild-type mice inoculated with either the Me7 or Rocky Mountain Laboratory strain of murine prions.
Particular muscles accumulated distinct levels of PrP(Sc), with the highest levels observed in muscle from the hind limb.
To determine whether prions are produced or merely accumulate intramuscularly, we established transgenic mice expressing either mouse or Syrian hamster PrP exclusively in muscle.
Inoculating these mice intramuscularly with prions resulted in the formation of high titers of nascent prions in muscle.
In contrast, inoculating mice in which PrP expression was targeted to hepatocytes resulted in low prion titers.
Our data demonstrate that factors in addition to the amount of PrP expressed determine the tropism of prions for certain tissues.
That some muscles are intrinsically capable of accumulating substantial titers of prions is of particular concern.
Because significant dietary exposure to prions might occur through the consumption of meat, even if it is largely free of neural and lymphatic tissue, a comprehensive effort to map the distribution of prions in the muscle of infected livestock is needed.
Furthermore, muscle may provide a readily biopsied tissue from which to diagnose prion disease in asymptomatic animals and even humans.

Abstract: Mammalian transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are likely due to the propagation of an abnormal form of a constitutive protein instead of traditional genetic material (nucleic acids).
Such infectious proteins, which are termed prions, exist in yeast.
They are at the origin of a number of phenotypes that are inherited in a non-Mendelian manner.
These prions are very useful to dissect the molecular events at the origin of this structure-based inheritance.
The properties of mammalian and yeast prions are presented and compared.

Abstract: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a zoonosis being the origin of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and an important cattle disease in its own right.
Countries have been slow to learn the importance of protecting, not only their cattle populations, but also their human populations.
Since 2000, several additional European countries have reported BSE in native-born stock and this has led to a concern about the BSE status of countries that have imported cattle and cattle products from infected countries.
Extensive feed and offal bans and application of newly-developed, "Rapid" tests for prion protein in central nervous tissue of targeted, high-risk animals and slaughter cattle over 30 months old now provides the tools whereby the public are fully protected and BSE can be eradicated.

Abstract: Currently, the diagnosis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy is only possible in the brain stem of dead animals.
Protease resistant prions are detected in the obex region of the brain stem.
However, from a veterinary medical and agricultural point of view the development of an in vivo detection assay is of utmost importance.
Because infectious prions are detectable relatively late in the central nervous system during an infection, efforts are made searching for surrogate markers.
Besides neuronal proteins that are released into the liquor and blood during neurodegenerative processes or other neuronal diseases, cellular nucleic acids circulating in the plasma or serum are an absolutely new approach for the detection of infectious diseases.

Abstract: This review examines recent attempts to advance the understanding of the mechanism by which neurones die in prion disease.
Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are characterized by the conversion of a normal glycoprotein, the prion protein, to a protease-resistant form that is suggested to be both the infectious agent and the cause of the rapid neurodegeneration in the disease.
Death of the patient results from this widespread neuronal loss.
Thus understanding the mechanism by which the abnormal form of the prion protein causes neuronal death might lead to treatments that would prevent the life-threatening nature of these diseases.

Abstract: During the past 30 years, over 60 different chemical compounds have been used to treat experimental animals infected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), including a wide variety of anti-infectious agents, immunomodulating drugs, and chemicals interacting with the lympho-reticular system.
Some compounds achieved a prolongation of the incubation period, but this effect decreased or disappeared when they were administered at or near the onset of symptomatic disease.
Recent in vitro and tissue culture studies support earlier speculation about the importance of a chemical structure containing both water-soluble and lipid-soluble components, evidently as a means of interaction with the misfolded membrane-bound 'prion' protein.
A number of compounds shown to eliminate the protein (or infectivity) in TSE-infected tissue cultures are the subject of ongoing studies in animals, and are under consideration for human drug trials.
As with other recalcitrant infections, combinations of drugs with different modes of action are likely to be necessary for any effective therapy.
Also, very recent work in developing antibodies that can neutralize in vitro infection (and, in conjunction with genetic engineering, in vivo infection) has renewed interest in the strategies of both active and passive immunization.

Journal of General Virology.
2002 Mar; 83(Pt 3): 695-704 ISSN: 0022-1317.
Abstract: Scrapie was transmitted to mice from ten sheep, collected in the UK between 1985 and 1994.
As in previous natural scrapie transmissions, the results varied between scrapie sources in terms of the incidence of disease, incubation periods and neuropathology in challenged mice.
This contrasted with the uniformity seen in transmissions of BSE to mice.
The scrapie and BSE isolates were characterized further by serial passage in mice.
Different TSE strains were isolated from each source according to the Sinc or PrP genotype of the mouse used for passage.
The same two mouse-passaged strains, 301C and 301V, were isolated from each of three BSE sources.
Despite the variation seen in the primary transmissions of scrapie, relatively few mouse-passaged scrapie strains were isolated and these were distinct from the BSE-derived strains.
The ME7 scrapie strain, which has often been isolated from independent sheep sources in the past, was identified in isolates from four of the sheep.
However, a new distinct strain, 221C, was derived from a further four scrapie sheep.
These results suggest that there is agent strain variation in natural scrapie in sheep and that the spectrum of strains present may have changed over the last 20 years.
The tested sample is too small to come to any conclusions about whether the BSE strain is present in sheep, but the study provides a framework for further more extensive studies.

ISSN: 0028-0836 Journal URL: www.nature.com/nature/ Abstract: A range of human degenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, light-chain amyloidosis and the spongiform encephalopathies, is associated with the deposition in tissue of proteinaceous aggregates known as amyloid fibrils or plaques.
It has been shown previously that fibrillar aggregates that are closely similar to those associated with clinical amyloidoses can be formed in vitro from proteins not connected with these diseases, including the SH3 domain from bovine phosphatidyl-inositol-3'-kinase and the amino-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli HypF protein.
Here we show that species formed early in the aggregation of these non-disease-associated proteins can be inherently highly cytotoxic.
This finding provides added evidence that avoidance of protein aggregation is crucial for the preservation of biological function and suggests common features in the origins of this family of protein deposition diseases.

Abstract: The blood supply is safer than it has been at any other time in recent history, and, in the context of other health care-related adverse events, the risks associated with blood transfusion are extremely small.
The current high level of safety is the result of successive refinements and improvements in how blood is collected, tested, processed, and transfused; nonetheless, blood and plasma products remain vulnerable to newly identified or reemerging infections.
In recent years, numerous infectious agents-including several newly discovered hepatitis viruses, the agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and tickborne pathogens-have been identified as potential threats to the safety of blood and plasma.
Continued vigilance is critical to protect the blood supply from known pathogens and to monitor for the emergence of new infectious agents.
Recent terrorist activities in the United States add new considerations to maintaining the safety and supply of blood.
Education of clinicians and patients regarding the benefits and risks associated with the judicious use of blood and blood products can assist in informed decision making.

Abstract: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder belonging to the spongiform encephalopathies.
A variant form (vCJD) is most likely the result of infection with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Diagnostic information can be obtained by EEG, testing cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of the 14-3-3 protein, MRI, brain biopsy, tonsil biopsy, and postmortem brain examination.
Some tests, such as MRI and postmortem brain examination, can be used to distinguish between CJD and vCJD.
Pathological prions in a tonsil biopsy are only found with vCJD.
In the Netherlands, there are four known cases of iatrogenic CJD.
On the basis of certain exposure to BSE via the food chain, cases of vCJD are also to be expected.
Chloropromazine and mepacrine are known to inhibit the formation of pathological prion conformations, but clinical trials have not yet been carried out.

Abstract: Prion disease is the new designation of a group of spongiform encephalopathies, all invariably fatal, which show similar clinical and neuropathological changes.
They comprise a range of distinct diseases in both animals and man, and spontaneous, hereditary and transmissible forms are recognized.
Until the sudden occurrence in the mid-1980s of an epizootic of a formerly unknown disease, popularly named 'mad cow disease', in cattle in the UK, very little attention had been paid to these rather obscure diseases.
Concurrently it was asserted that the disease-causing agent appeared to be a ubiquitous mammalian brain constituent, and the disease mechanism a conformational change of its structure.
These events have not only led to a new understanding of these extraordinary diseases, but have also provided insight into both neurodegeneration and disease mechanisms at the molecular level.
Moreover, in 1997 the prion concept earned its originator the second Nobel price for medicine within this scientific field.
In this introduction and overview of prion diseases, historical and philosophical perspectives are presented along with descriptions of the diseases in both animals and man.
Epidemiology, genetics and transmissibility are also covered.

Abstract: Due to concerns about a link between variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and similar prion protein-induced disease in cattle, i.e., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), strict controls are in place to exclude BSE-positive animals and/or specified risk materials including bovine central nervous system (CNS) tissue from the human food chain.
However, current slaughter practice, using captive bolt guns, may induce disruption of brain tissues and mobilize CNS tissues into the bovine circulatory system, leading to the dispersion of CNS tissues (including prion proteins) throughout the derived carcass.
This project used a marker (antibiotic-resistant) strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens to model the effects of commercial captive bolt stunning procedures on the movement of mobilized CNS material within slaughtered animals and the abattoir environment.
The marker organism, introduced by injection through the bolt entry aperture or directly using a cartridge-fired captive bolt, was detected in the slaughter environment immediately after stunning and in the abattoir environment at each subsequent stage of the slaughter-dressing process.
The marker organism was also detected on the hands of operatives; on slaughter equipment; and in samples of blood, organs, and musculature of inoculated animals.
There were no significant differences between the results obtained by the two inoculation methods (P 
This study demonstrates that material present in, or introduced into, the CNS of cattle during commercial captive bolt stunning may become widely dispersed across the many animate and inanimate elements of the slaughter-dressing environment and within derived carcasses including meat entering the human food chain.

ISSN: 0022-1554.
Journal URL: www.jhc.org Abstract: The histological diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), such as scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), relies on identification in the brain of spongiosis, gliosis, and neuron loss without inflammatory lesions.
Because of its sensitivity, immunohistochemistry of abnormal prion protein (PrPsc) is of great help in this diagnosis and can be used on its own or complementary to the biochemical detection of PrPsc.
However, in some cases no formalin-fixed material is available, rendering its use as a complementary method impossible.
For that purpose, we studied the possibility of detecting PrPsc immunohistochemically in fixed brain samples that had been previously frozen and used for Western blotting analysis.
We compared freshly and fixed-frozen brain samples originating from the same sheep, either affected or unaffected with scrapie.
We also studied fixed-frozen brain samples from scrapie-affected goats and from cows showing BSE.
We showed that in all the species tested, despite damage to the histological structures, PrPsc was still detectable in the fixed-frozen brain sections without unspecific background staining.
Notwithstanding the limited number of cases thus far analyzed, we have already demonstrated the possibility of using PrPsc immunohistochemistry on fixed-frozen brain samples with very good efficacy, thus rendering possible its use for diagnostic purposes in TSEs.

Abstract: Blood infectivity in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) is reviewed with special emphasis on transmission by blood transfusion in human beings.
It is concluded that transmission by transfusion seems biologically plausible as regards variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (vCJD), albeit present knowledge suggests that it is extremely uncommon.
Precautionary measures against the putative risk of vCJD transmission by blood transfusion are discussed.

ISSN: 0028-0836 Journal URL: www.nature.com/nature/ Abstract: Following the controversial failure of a recent study and the small numbers of animals yet screened for infection, it remains uncertain whether bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was transmitted to sheep in the past via feed supplements and whether it is still present.
Well grounded mathematical and statistical models are therefore essential to integrate the limited and disparate data, to explore uncertainty, and to define data-collection priorities.
We analysed the implications of different scenarios of BSE spread in sheep for relative human exposure levels and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) incidence.
Here we show that, if BSE entered the sheep population and a degree of transmission occurred, then ongoing public health risks from ovine BSE are likely to be greater than those from cattle, but that any such risk could be reduced by up to 90% through additional restrictions on sheep products entering the food supply.
Extending the analysis to consider absolute risk, we estimate the 95% confidence interval for future vCJD mortality to be 50 to 50,000 human deaths considering exposure to bovine BSE alone, with the upper bound increasing to 150,000 once we include exposure from the worst-case ovine BSE scenario examined.

Infection has been compared to 'setting a clock' which then runs inexorably as the disease spreads, usually through the lymphoreticular system and then via peripheral nerves to the central nervous system (CNS), although the mechanism controlling the protracted progression is not known.
Clinical disease develops as characteristic degenerative changes in the CNS progress, but the molecular basis for this pathology is not clear, particularly the relationship between the deposition of abnormal PrP and neuronal dysfunction.
Recent research has identified several means of slowing (if not stopping) the clock when infection has not yet reached the CNS; although the potential for later stage therapies seems limited, neuroprotective strategies which have been shown to be effective in other neurodegenerative conditions may also ameliorate TSE induced CNS pathology.
This review focuses on our current knowledge of the key events following infection of the CNS and the opportunities for intervention once the CNS has become infected.

Abstract: The history of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is shortly reviewed beginning with the Westminster parliament act in the year 1755 up to the description in 1996 of the variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, transmitted from cattle to man by alimentary route.
The epidemiological patterns of encephalopathies of the various animal species and of the four encephalopathies up to date reported in man are shortly described: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Kuru, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, Fatal Familial Insomnia.
Etiological hypotheses are discussed until the identification of Prions: PrPcell, on the surface of normal cells, PrPscr in the brain of humans and animals dead for these diseases.
The strains of the PrPscr are described on the basis of some characters observed through the passages in rodents and of molecular pattern.
The possible future epidemiological evolution of the vCJD is also discussed.

Abstract: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is one of a family of neurodegenerative diseases, first diagnosed in 1996.
Scientific evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that it is acquired through consumption of bovine spongiform encephalopathy-infected meat.
The majority of cases have been diagnosed in the UK in young individuals, with an excess of cases in the north and a significant cluster of cases in Leicestershire.
Many uncertainties in its biology and epidemiology, in particular the length of the incubation period, make predictions of any future epidemic difficult.
Studies are currently under way to obtain more precise estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic infection through testing tonsil and appendix tissues for the abnormal prion protein.

Abstract: The detection of pathological prion protein is considered as pathognomonic for the diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
According to the EU regulations cattle older than 30 months of age (Germany 24 months) and slaughtered for human consumption must be tested by using BSE rapid tests.
Likewise must be fallen stock and clinically affected animals.
This article gives an overview over the diagnostic hierarchy and organization of the diagnostic system for BSE and scrapie in Germany.
All suspect cases found by rapid testing are reinvestigated and clarified by the National reference laboratory for these diseases which is part of the recently founded Institute of Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Federal Research Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals located on the isle of Riems.
Until the end of 2001 130 BSE cases were confirmed out of 230 submissions.

2002 Mar; 13(3): 164-8 ISSN: 0938-8990.
Abstract: A genome-wide search for markers associated with BSE incidence was performed by using Transmission-Disequilibrium Tests (TDTs).
Significant segregation distortion, i.e., unequal transmission probabilities of alleles within a locus, was found for three marker loci on Chromosomes (Chrs) 5, 10, and 20.
Although TDTs are robust to false associations owing to hidden population substructures, it cannot distinguish segregation distortion caused by a true association between a marker and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from a population-wide distortion.
An interaction test and a segregation distortion analysis in half-sib controls were used to disentangle these two alternative hypotheses.
None of the markers showed any significant interaction between allele transmission rates and disease status, and only the marker on Chr 10 showed a significant segregation distortion in control individuals.
Nevertheless, the control group may have been a mixture of resistant and susceptible but unchallenged individuals.
When new genotypes were generated in the vicinity of these three markers, evidence for an association with BSE was confirmed for the locus on Chr 5.

Abstract: Prion diseases of humans and animals are associated with the accumulation of an abnormal isoform (PrP(Sc)) of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP(C)).
Transmission of these diseases between mammalian species is usually limited by a 'species barrier', which can be mediated by differences in primary sequence of the prion protein between donor and host species.
Studies on species barriers usually rely on the development of clinical disease in inoculated animals as an assessment of susceptibility in a particular host.
Recent studies by a number of groups have demonstrated that the absence of clinical symptoms does not necessarily exclude transmission of prion disease across a species barrier.
Such results indicate that subclinical or carrier states exist in these diseases, which has public health implications regarding human exposure to BSE prions and iatrogenic transmission from apparently healthy humans.
Here the issue of subclinical prion diseases is reviewed and implications are discussed.

Migrating intestinal dendritic cells transport PrP(Sc) from the gut.
Journal of General Virology.
2002 Jan; 83(Pt 1): 267-71.
ISSN: 0022-1317.
Abstract: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and possibly also sheep scrapie are orally acquired transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).
TSE agents usually replicate in lymphoid tissues before they spread into the central nervous system.
In mouse TSE models PrP(c)-expressing follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) resident in lymphoid germinal centres are essential for replication, and in their absence neuroinvasion is impaired.
Disease-associated forms of PrP (PrP(Sc)), a biochemical marker for TSE infection, also accumulate on FDCs in the lymphoid tissues of patients with vCJD and sheep with natural scrapie.
TSE transport mechanisms between gut lumen and germinal centres are unknown.
Migratory bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs), entering the intestinal wall from blood, sample antigens from the gut lumen and carry them to mesenteric lymph nodes.
Here we show that DCs acquire PrP(Sc) in vitro, and transport intestinally administered PrP(Sc) directly into lymphoid tissues in vivo.
These studies suggest that DCs are a cellular bridge between the gut lumen and the lymphoid TSE replicative machinery.

Abstract: The neuropathological and biochemical features of the 89 histologically confirmed cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) diagnosed up to the end of October 2001 in the UK are reviewed.
Histology of the central nervous system, lymphoid tissues and other organs was accompanied by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis of the disease-associated form of the prion protein (PrP(RES)).
All patients with vCJD were methionine homozygotes at codon 129 of the PrP gene.
The pathology of vCJD showed relatively uniform morphological and immunocytochemical characteristics, which were distinct from other forms of CJD. PrP(RES) accumulation was widespread in lymphoid tissues in vCJD, but was not identified in other non-neural tissues.
PrP(RES) in vCJD brain tissue showed a uniform glycotype pattern distinct from sporadic CJD.
Given the increasingly widespread occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Europe and Asia, there is a major need for widespread CJD surveillance.
This should be accompanied by a multidisciplinary laboratory approach to the investigation and diagnosis of all forms of CJD, with the need to investigate autopsy tissues from suspected cases by the histological and biochemical techniques described herein.

Abstract: There is continual variation in viral epidemics regarding clinical symptoms, duration and disappearance, and the emergence of new diseases.
This can be observed in both human and animal diseases.
This evolution of virus diseases is mainly related to three factors: aetiological agent, host and environment.
As far as genetic alterations of the virus are concerned, two major mechanisms are involved: mutations such as recombination and reassortment; and selection for resistance or susceptibility.
This review focuses on the epidemiology of newly emerged virus diseases in man and animals, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, haemorraghic fevers, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, canine haemorraghic disease and respiratory syndrome in horses.

The potential size and duration of an epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in British sheep.
Science.
Washington, DC. 11 January, 2002; 295 (5553): 332-335.
ISSN: 0036-8075 Abstract:
Because there is a theoretical possibility that the British national sheep flock is infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), we examined the extent of a putative epidemic.
An age cohort analysis based on numbers of infected cattle, dose responses of cattle and sheep to BSE, levels of exposure to infected feed, and number of BSE-susceptible sheep in the United Kingdom showed that at the putative epidemic peak in 1990, the number of cases of BSE-infected sheep would have ranged from fewer than 10 to about 1500.
The model predicts that fewer than 20 clinical cases of BSE in sheep would be expected in 2001 if maternal transmission occurred at a rate of 10%.
Although there are large uncertainties in the parameter estimates, all indications are that current prevalence is low; however, a simple model of flock-to-flock BSE transmission shows that horizontal transmission, if it has occurred, could eventually cause a large epidemic.

Abstract: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a fatal and untreatable neurological disease, in which pathogenic prions (PrPSc) are involved.
There is convincing epidemiological and experimental evidence that vCJD is a human expression of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The risk of transmission of pathogenic prions which cause vCJD to humans is influenced by the species barrier, genetic susceptibility of the host, dose of infection and route of exposure.
Transmission of pathogenic prions from bovines to humans is possible through meat products containing nerve and lymphatic tissue, and through medical products derived from bovine material.
Human to human transmission is, in principle, also possible via blood and blood-derived products, human organs and tissues for transplantation, and through surgical instruments.
Preventive measures to reduce transmission from bovines to humans have been introduced step by step in the Netherlands since 1989.
With proper implementation, the current risk of becoming infected by Dutch meat products is small.
It is very likely, however, that in the past decade BSE-infected bovines have entered the food chain.
The Dutch population has also been exposed to foreign infected meat products.
Measures to prevent human to human transmission are currently being improved in the Netherlands.
It is expected that cases of vCJD will occur in the Netherlands in the future, but the number cannot be estimated accurately.
The presence of PrPSc in both the livestock and in the human population in the Netherlands constitutes a permanent public health threat and is a reason for continued vigilance and active prevention.

27(1-2): 305-313 ISSN: 0731-7085 Abstract: As a consequence of the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), ruminants materials have been generally banned from the production of heparin.
Immunochemical methods have been recently developed for the control of the raw materials used by manufacturers of materials such as porcine mucosa and for the detection of bovine crude heparins.
To certify the porcine origin of crude porcine heparins and to exclude ovine or caprine materials, new ELISAs were developed.
Rabbit antisera were produced against species-specific antigenic contaminants present in crude heparins or in eluted materials (EM) from the chromatographic step of the purification process.
When analysed by line immunoelectrophoresis, these antisera revealed five to eleven antigenic contaminants in the EMs, the major one being the most anodic and predominant antigen in crude heparins.
Using the best antisera, competitive indirect ELISAs were optimised.
They allowed the detection of porcine, ovine and caprine crude heparins down to a dilution of 0.6 to 1.5 parts per 1000, with CVs ranging from 3 to 12%.
These ELISAs complete the set of immunological techniques which can be routinely used by heparin manufacturers to secure their supply chain.

Abstract: Several methods for the detection of tissues of the central nervous system (CNS) in meat products have been developed and partly validated for use in official food control as pertaining to human BSE-exposure risk.
So far, however, methods for the detection of abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) were not evaluated for their potential applicability to the matrix of heat treated meat products.
We developed a micro technological procedure for the preparation of meat products suitable for high security laboratories as masses were 6 to 8 orders of magnitude lower than in conventional meat technology.
Thus it was possible to produce standard micro sausages containing defined amounts of bovine BSE-positive brain.
This material showed all characteristics of normal meat products and a homogeneous distribution of brain as indicated by NSE and GFAP western immunoblotting and GFAP immunometric analyses.
Using a commercially available and certified immunometric assay for detection of PrPSc in untreated brain it was possible to detect BSE-positive CNS down to a content of 0.25% in heat treated meat products.
We found a high correlation between PrPSc OD-values and CNS content and linearity up to 10% CNS.
In 30 samples of retail meat products no sample transgressed the official cut off value for untreated bovine brain.
Further studies are needed to show whether an increase of sensitivity in PrPSc detection from the meat product matrix is possible, in particular by optimisation of the extraction procedure.

2002 Mar-Apr; 115(3-4): 118-21 ISSN: 0005-9366 Abstract: Contamination of beef by tissues of the central nervous system (CNS) due to slaughter technology causes some concern considering the potential health hazard by food borne exposure to the infectious agent of BSE.
The present study was designed to quantify the extent of CNS contamination as pertaining to stunning and splitting technology.
Of the 726 animals 48 contained a total of 58 emboli-like particles in lungs and/or right ventricles.
The incidence of emboli-like particles was found to be slightly higher in animals slaughtered without pithing (5.9%) than in the animals slaughtered with pithing (4.1%).
Of the 58 emboli-like particles only two were positive in the anti-NSE western immunoblotting (0.3% of the 726 animals).
The immuno reaction of these NSE-positive particles was several orders of magnitude lower as obtained by pure brain material.
The microscopical analysis of the two NSE-positive emboli-like particles for presence of CNS-like tissues was negative.
Following splitting of carcasses by sawing with and without prior removing the spinal cord we found NSE-positive reactions in 32% and 17% of the samples, respectively.
The immuno reaction, however, was predominantly comparable to standard material containing less than 0.5% CNS.
Overall the results show that CNS contamination of bovine carcasses cannot be excluded by current slaughter technology.
However, the additional human BSE-exposure risk can be judged to be at least minor when considering extent of contamination, dilution effects and BSE-testing.

Prions in dermatology.
Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.
2002 May; 46(5): 790-3 ISSN: 0190-9622 Abstract: Prion diseases are uncommon fatal neurodegenerative disorders that have gained scientific importance as a result of the emergence of new forms of these diseases in both animals and humans.
Prions appear to be composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of a host-encoded glycoprotein.
There is substantial scientific evidence to support the notion that bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow disease") has affected humans.
Recent studies have demonstrated that prions can adhere easily to metal surfaces, and normal sterilization procedures are not likely to completely inactivate them.
Iatrogenic transmission of prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, was recognized after corneal transplantations, dura mater grafts, neurosurgical procedures, and the use of human hormones (growth hormone and gonadotropin).
Although bovine collagen has long been recognized as a safe and biocompatible material, dermatologists should be aware of the theoretical potential for prion transmission when materials from bovine origin and products obtained from cultured cells fed with fetal or newborn calf serum are used.

Mabbott, Neil A; McGovern, Gillian; Jeffrey, Martin; Bruce, Moira E. Temporary blockade of the tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway impedes the spread of scrapie to the brain.
Journal of Virology 2002 May; 76(10): 5131-9.
ISSN: 0022-538X Journal URL: intl-jvi.asm.org Abstract: Although the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative diseases, their agents usually replicate and accumulate in lymphoid tissues long before infection spreads to the central nervous system (CNS).
Studies of a mouse scrapie model have shown that mature follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which express the host prion protein (PrP(c)), are critical for replication of infection in lymphoid tissues.
In the absence of mature FDCs, the spread of infection to the CNS is significantly impaired.
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion by lymphocytes is important for maintaining FDC networks, and signaling is mediated through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR-1) expressed on FDCs and/or their precursors.
A treatment that blocks TNFR signaling leads to the temporary dedifferentiation of mature FDCs, raising the hypothesis that a similar treatment would significantly delay the peripheral pathogenesis of scrapie.
Here, specific neutralization of the TNFR signaling pathway was achieved through treatment with a fusion protein consisting of two soluble human TNFR (huTNFR) (p80) domains linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (huTNFR:Fc).
A single treatment of mice with huTNFR:Fc before or shortly after intraperitoneal injection with the ME7 scrapie strain significantly delayed the onset of disease in the CNS and reduced the early accumulation of disease-specific PrP in the spleen.
These effects coincided with a temporary dedifferentiation of mature FDCs within 5 days of huTNFR:Fc treatment.
We conclude that treatments that specifically inhibit the TNFR signaling pathway may present an opportunity for early intervention in peripherally transmitted TSEs.

Filipin prevents pathological prion protein accumulation by reducing endocytosis and inducing cellular PrP release.
Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2002 Jul 12; 277(28): 25457-64.
ISSN: 0021-9258 Abstract: Conversion of the normal membrane-bound prion protein (PrP-sen) to its pathological isoform (PrP-res) is a key event in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
Although the subcellular sites of conversion are poorly characterized, several lines of evidence have suggested the involvement of membrane lipid rafts in the conversion process.
Here we report that copper stimulates the endocytosis of PrP-sen via a caveolin-dependent pathway in both microglia and neuroblastoma cells.
We show that the polyene antibiotic filipin both limits endocytosis of PrP-sen and dramatically reduces the amount of membrane-bound PrP-sen.
This reduction results from a rapid and massive release of full matured PrP-sen into the culture medium.
Finally, we demonstrate that filipin is a potent inhibitor of PrP-res formation into chronically infected neuroblastoma cells.
Our results reinforce the role of rafts in PrP trafficking and raise the possibility that the release of PrP-sen from the plasma membrane decreases the amount of available substrate PrP-sen at the conversion sites.

2002 Apr 17; 288(1-2): 139-46 ISSN: 0378-1119 Abstract: The Prion protein (PrP) plays a central role in Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).
Mutations in the protein coding region of the human PrP gene (PRNP), which have been proposed to alter the stability of the PrP protein, have been linked to a number of forms of TSE.
However, the majority of CJD cases are not associated with mutations in the PRNP coding region and alternative mechanisms must therefore underlie susceptibility to these forms of CJD. Transgenic mice, that over- or under-express PrP genes, have shown a correlation between the level of PrP gene expression and the incubation time of disease.
Polymorphisms that lead to alterations in human PRNP gene expression, could therefore be candidates for influencing susceptibility of an individual to CJD.
In order to investigate this hypothesis, we have defined an upstream and intronic regulatory region of the PRNP gene.
Sequencing of these regions in controls, sporadic CJD (sCJD) and variant CJD (vCJD) patients has identified three polymorphisms, all of which are more common in sCJD patients than controls.
Our data suggests that polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the PRNP gene may be a risk factor for CJD. NAL call no. QH442.A1G4 Descriptors: risk factors for disease, humans, polymorphisms, regulatory regions.

These diseases are believed to be the consequence of the conformational conversion of the prion protein into an abnormal isoform.
Their exact pathogenic mechanism remains uncertain, but it is believed that oxidative stress plays a central role.
In this article, we will first review in detail the data supporting the latter hypothesis.
Subsequently, we will discuss the relationship between the prion protein and the cellular response to oxidative stress, attempting ultimately to link PrP function and neurodegeneration in these disorders.

A critical review of the nature of the spongiform encephalopathy agent: protein theory versus virus theory.
Experimental Biology and Medicine.
2002 Jan; 227(1): 4-19.
ISSN: 1535-3702.
Abstract: All spongiform encephalopathies (SEs) result in brain disorders brought about by a slow virus.
Since the origin of bovine SE (BSE), the infectious nature of the disease has been firmly established.
Tubulofilamentous particles/scrapie termed nemavirus (NVP) and scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) are ultrastructural markers, whereas protease-resistant protein (PrP(sc)) is a protein marker.
The PrP molecules aggregate to form SAF.
Each NVP consists of three layers: an outer protein coat, an intermediate ssDNA layer, and inner PrP/SAF.
Therefore, ssDNA and PrP/SAF are physically associated with each other.
The existence of at least 20 stable strains of SEs implies that a nucleic acid molecule serves as the information molecule.
Animals inoculated with PrP(sc) do not develop the clinical disease, however, ssDNA purified from scrapie-hamster brains by alkaline gel electrophoresis mixed with binding proteins before inoculation developed the clinical disease.
It appears that an "accessory protein" coded by the ssDNA of the NVP interacts with normal PrP(c) molecules, resulting in their conversion to PrP(sc)/SAF.
The pathogenesis process in the infected animal, with increasing incubation periods, reveals that larger amounts of normal PrP molecules are modified to form SAF.
This interferes with the normal supply of PrP to cell membranes, which become disrupted and eventually fragment, resulting in the vacuoles typical of those found in the SEs.
Critical review of scientific literature has demonstrated that the agent contains a DNA genome.

Lymphotoxin-alpha- and lymphotoxin-beta-deficient mice differ in susceptibility to scrapie: evidence against dendritic cell involvement in neuroinvasion.
Journal of Virology 2002 May; 76(9): 4357-63.
ISSN: 0022-538X.
Abstract: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals often initiated by oral intake of an infectious agent.
Current evidence suggests that infection occurs initially in the lymphoid tissues and subsequently in the central nervous system (CNS).
The identity of infected lymphoid cells remains controversial, but recent studies point to the involvement of both follicular dendritic cells (centers is dependent on lymphotoxin alpha (LT-alpha) and LT-beta signaling components.
We report here that by the oral route, LT-alpha -/- mice developed scrapie while LT-beta -/- mice did not.
Furthermore, LT-alpha -/- mice had a higher incidence and shorter incubation period for developing disease following inoculation than did LT-beta -/- mice.
Transplantation of lymphoid tissues from LT-beta -/- mice, which have cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, into LT-alpha -/- mice, which do not, did not alter the incidence of CNS scrapie.
In other studies, a virus that is tropic for and alters functions of CD11c(+) cells did not alter the kinetics of neuroinvasion of scrapie.
Our results suggest that neither FDC nor CD11c(+) cells are essential for neuroinvasion after high doses of RML scrapie.
Further, it is possible that an as yet unidentified cell found more abundantly in LT-alpha -/- than in LT-beta -/- mice may assist in the amplification of scrapie infection in the periphery and favor susceptibility to CNS disease following peripheral routes of infection.

Abstract:
The evolution of monitoring and surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from the phase of passive surveillance that began in the United Kingdom in 1988 until the present is described.
The results of the ongoing BSE testing in Denmark have been analyzed using two statistical approaches: the "classical" frequentist and the Bayesian that is widely used in quantitative risk analysis.
The analyses were intended to provide information for decision-markers, the media and the public as well as to provide inputs for future BSE surveillance models.
The results to date suggest that the total number of BSE cases that will be found in Denmark in 2001 will not exceed 16.

Prion diseases: epidemiology in man.
APMIS Acta Pathologica, Microbiologica, et Immunologica Scandinavica 2002 Jan; 110(1): 14-22 ISSN: 0903-4641.
Abstract: Prion disease in man was first described as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in the 1920s.
CJD may have three different origins: sporadic, familial, due to mutations in the prion gene, or infectious, due to iatrogenic exposure to infectious brain material.
As an example of the latter, kuru, in Papua New Guinea, was a variant of CJD transmitted by cannibalism.
Between 1957 and 1982 more than 2500 died of kuru.
Sporadic CJD is the most common form of CJD and occurs with an incidence of around one per million in most parts of the world.
Familial CJD accounts for approximately 10% of all European cases of CJD, and is associated with inherited mutations of the prion protein gene, caused by one of the 24 single amino acid substitutions or insertions of octapeptide repeats.
CJD caused by infections involves either iatrogenic cases of CJD, resulting from exposure to infectious brain, pituitary or ocular tissue, or from ingestion of infected food items.
As of today, a few hundred iatrogenic cases of CJD have been diagnosed worldwide, the majority due to transmission by cadaveric pituitary HCG.
So far, 111 cases of vCJD have been diagnosed caused by BSE-contaminated food.
The size of the epidemic is still unclear and worst-case scenarios indicate that we may expect many thousands of cases in the future.

Part I. Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery.
2002 Jan; 104(1): 1-9 ISSN: 0303-8467.
Abstract: The astute observation by William Hadlow, an American veterinary neuropathologist of the similarity between the histopathology of kuru, an obscure disease of the primitive tribe in New Guinea, and scrapie of sheep, was the first clue to the etiology of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE).
The knowledge that scrapie was transmissible but only after an unusually long incubation period, that the causative agent was highly resistant to heat and formalin, and that it seemed to be able to replicate in the absence of nucleic acid, eventually led to the discovery of the prion by Stanley Pruisner and the still controversial protein-only hypothesis of etiology of the TSE.

2002 May; 104(2): 77-86 ISSN: 0303-8467 Abstract: The protein-only theory of transmission of the prion diseases remains controversial.
Other mechanisms such as the virus, virino, and viroid hypotheses are still under consideration.
All these fit in the concept of 'slow' infections that had been proposed in 1954 by Bjorn Sigurdsson, an Icelandic pathologist.
Regardless of the exact mode of infection, the presence of prions in the brain has served to unite Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia, as well as scrapie and a number of other animal diseases, into a single pathological entity, the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
The appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom and its putative relationship to new variant CJD, have put a new and unpredictable light on these unusual and uncommon diseases.

Abstract: Data recording the course of scrapie outbreaks in 4 sheep flocks (2 in Cheviot sheep and 2 in Suffolks) are compared.
For each outbreak the data on scrapie incidence and sheep demography and pedigrees cover periods of years or decades.
A key finding is that the incidence of clinical cases peaks in sheep 2-3 years old, despite very different forces-of-infection.
This is consistent with age-specific susceptibility of sheep to scrapie, as has been reported for cattle to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and for humans to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Scrapie incidence was higher in ewes than rams and at certain times of years, though these effects were not consistent between flocks.
There was no evidence for high levels of vertical transmission.

Aggregation characteristics of ovalbumin in beta-sheet conformation determined by spectroscopy.
Biopolymers.
2002; 67(2): 113-20 ISSN: 0006-3525.
Abstract: Protein misfolding and aggregation are involved in a number of the so-called "conformational" diseases (e.g., transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and Alzheimer disease).
The development of rational strategies to interfere with aggregation is a potential therapeutic approach that requires complete knowledge of the aggregation process.
We studied the aggregation of ovalbumin in beta-sheet conformation using mainly the spectral changes in the spectra of two dyes (Congo Red and pinacyanol) caused by the aggregates.
We assumed a linear model of polymerization that fit to the experimental data.
The critical aggregation constant, concentration of half-aggregation, nucleation parameter, growth parameter, and number of aggregation and free energy changes (total and per residue) were determined as aggregation-related parameters.
Beta-Ovalbumin aggregates in a cooperative way.
Moreover, the differences between such parameters obtained with Congo Red and pinacyanol suggest that each dye interacts with the protein in its own way.

Increased clusterin (apolipoprotein J) expression in human and mouse brains infected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
Acta Neuropathologica (Berl).
2002 Mar; 103(3): 199-208.
ISSN: 0001-6322.
Abstract: Clusterin (apolipoprotein J), a multifunctional protein involved in amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease, was studied immunohistochemically in both human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and a mouse model of human TSE. Clusterin immunoreactivity was co-localized with plaque-type deposits but not with punctate-type prion protein (PrP) deposits in human TSEs.
On the other hand, clusterin-positive astrocytes were readily demonstrated in the regions of punctate PrP deposits, but not around plaque PrP deposits despite the presence of surrounding astrocytes.
Clusterin expression in astrocytes was not disease specific, but the punctate immunoreactivity for clusterin was more prominently demonstrated in TSEs with punctate PrP deposits.
Serial analysis in the mouse model of human TSE revealed that clusterin expression in astrocytes was enhanced in the lesions with punctate-type PrP deposits during the disease progression.
Thus, the induction of clusterin expression in astrocytes could be more enhanced by punctate-type PrP deposits than by plaque-type deposits.
The clusterin molecules co-localized in plaque PrP deposits might be derived not from surrounding astrocytes but from other resources such as cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma, both of which contain clusterin in significant amounts.
Taken together with previously reported findings of the anti-amyloidogenic property in clusterin, our findings suggest that clusterin may be induced as one of the important molecules participating in the neurodegeneration caused by abnormally deposited PrP.

Abstract:
It is only in the last 5 years that the Netherlands has been confronted with cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The cases diagnosed to date have not been clearly linked to imports from the United Kingdom.
This article describes the various possible explanations for the Dutch cases.
The risk factors involved, have either a connection with imported BSE, local origin of BSE, or both.
These factors can also be divided into introductory risk and propagation risk, terms that were also used in an EU risk assessment study.
Research at ID-Lelystad since the early 1990s and at IKC-Ede has tried to assess the relative importance of the various risk factors, the results of which are discussed in this paper.
The paper does not deal with the specifics of the cases diagnosed to date, because of the absence of an in-depth epidemiological investigation, but provides a general assessment of the risk factors that might have played a role.
Important factors have been, in addition to the initial imports of cattle and meat and bone-meal from the UK, the continuing imports from other countries with covert BSE and the cross-contamination within the animal feed production lines.
Emphasis is on the period of the early and mid-1990s, the period in which most calves with diagnosed BSE were born.

Abstract: SRM-regulations and the prohibition of pithing have removed major risks of spreading BSE-infection.
Traditional slaughter technology, especially captive bolt stunning, head handling and carcass splitting nevertheless still provide non-negligible risks for contamination with the BSE-agent if present in cattle, and should therefore be replaced by safer techniques.
However, alternative methods like electrical stunning or removal of the spinal cord prior to splitting the carcass cannot yet be considered a reliable and practical option.
Surface contamination could be prevented altogether by abandoning the practice of carcass splitting and by removing the vertebral column while still connected to the head, although this would result in disadvantages for post mortem inspection.

Abstract: The absence of an immune response to prions--the infectious agents of scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease--might be related to the fact that these agents do not contain nucleic acids.
We aimed to use CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, which have been shown to stimulate innate immunity, as a form of postexposure prophylaxis in mice.
We inoculated healthy mice with brain homogenates from mice infected with the RML scrapie prion, and then injected CpG oligodeoxynucleotides.
This postexposure prophylaxis with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in 38% longer survival times than treatment with saline (p
The explanation for this finding remains to be elucidated, but the most likely is stimulation of TLR9-expressing cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells.
CpG oligodeoxynucleotides have not been shown to have adverse effects to human health and could therefore be considered as a therapeutic choice in postexposure prophylaxis.

The binding of prion proteins to serum components is affected by detergent extraction conditions.
: Journal of Neurochemistry.
2002 Jul; 82(1): 1-5 ISSN: 0022-3042.
Abstract: As many GPI anchored proteins, PrP(C) and its abnormal conformer PrP(Sc), are inserted into membrane microdomains known as rafts.
Upon raft disruption, PrP(C) becomes soluble, while PrP(Sc) aggregates into insoluble structures.
It was recently published that, as opposed to PrP(C), PrP(Sc), as well as its protease resistant core PrP27-30, can bind specifically to plasminogen and other serum components.
These findings were suggested to have important physiological implications in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) diagnosis and pathogenesis.
In this work, we show that the binding of PrP(Sc) or PrP 27-30 to serum proteins occurs only at specific detergent combinations, in which disease associated PrPs are present in aggregated structures.
At detergent conditions in which rafts are intact, it is actually PrP(C.) that binds to blood proteins, albeit not directly, but through neighboring rafts components.
Our results therefore indicate that the binding of PrP(Sc) to blood components has no physiological relevance.

2002 Mar; 42(3): 334-42 ISSN: 0041-1132.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Blood and plasma of animals experimentally infected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) can transmit TSE infection by transfusion.
A conformational isoform of prion protein (PrPsc) is believed to be the TSE-infectious agent that propagates by converting the cellular prion protein (PrPc) to additional molecules of PrPsc.
In orally infected animals, PrPsc accumulates in intestinal endothelial cells.
In blood, two thirds of PrPc resides in plasma, but its source is not known.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression of PrPc in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was studied using flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and RT-PCR.
Flow cytometry was used to characterize endothelial membrane microparticles (MPs) in cell culture supernatants and in normal human plasma.
RESULTS: HUVECs and bovine aorta endothelial cells express PrPc.
The number of surface PrPc molecules per cell in HUVECs was 58,000 +/- 2,800.
The induction of apoptosis in HUVECs led to a marked release of membrane MPs (60,000-80,000 MPs/10(3) cells) that expressed PrPc and other endothelial antigens.
The presence of endothelial cell-derived MPs expressing PrPc was demonstrated in platelet-free human plasma.
CONCLUSION: Endothelial cell apoptosis is associated with the release of PrPc-positive MPs.
These MPs contribute to the PrPc pool in plasma and may have a role in disseminating TSE infectivity in blood.

Prion peptide 106-126 as a model for prion replication and neurotoxicity.
Frontiers of Bioscience Computer File: a Journal and Virtual Library.
2002 Apr 1; 7: a60-71.
ISSN: 1093-4715.
Abstract: Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are neurodegenerative disorders that are genetic, sporadic, or infectious.
The pathogenetic event common to all prion disorders is a change in conformation of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to the scrapie isoform (PrPSc), which, unlike PrPC, aggregates easily and is partially resistant to protease digestion.
Although PrPSc is believed to be essential for the pathogenesis and transmission of prion disorders, the mechanism by which PrPSc deposits cause neurodegeneration is unclear.
It has been proposed that in some cases of prion disorders, a transmembrane form of PrP, termed CtmPrP may be the mediator of neurodegenerative changes rather than PrPSc per se.
In order to understand the underlying cellular processes by which PrPSc mediates neurodegeneration, we have investigated the mechanism of neurotoxicity by a beta-sheet rich peptide of PrP in a cell model.
We show that exposure of human neuronal cell lines NT-2 and M17 to the prion peptide 106-126 (PrP106-126) catalyzes the aggregation of endogenous cellular prion protein (PrPC) to an amyloidogenic form that shares several characteristics with PrPSc.
Intracellular accumulation of these PrPSc-like forms upregulates the synthesis of CtmPrP, which is proteolytically cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum and the truncated C-terminal fragment is transported to the cell surface.
In addition, we have isolated mutant NT-2 and neuroblastoma cells that are resistant to toxicity by PrP106-126 to facilitate further characterization of the biochemical pathways of PrP106-126 neurotoxicity.
The PrP106-126-resistant phenotype of these cells could result from aberrant binding or internalization of the peptide, or due to an abnormality in the downstream pathway(s) of neuronal toxicity.
Thus, our data suggest that PrPSc aggregation occurs by a process of 'nucleation' on a pre-existing 'seed' of PrP.
Furthermore, the PrP106-126-resistant cells reported here will provide a unique opportunity for identifying the cellular and biochemical pathways that mediate neurotoxicity by PrPSc.

v. 277 (13) p. 11084-11089.
ISSN: 0021-9258 Journal URL: www.jbc.org/ Abstract: Some transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) (or "prion") strains, notably those derived from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, are highly resistant to total inactivation by heat.
When three TSE strains derived from sheep with scrapie were heated, little inactivation took place at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures, considerable inactivation occurred.
The temperature at which substantial inactivation first occurred varied according to TSE strain, and it was calculated to be 70 degrees C for the 22C strain, 84 degrees C for ME7, and 97 degrees C for 22A by fitting the data to a model based on competition between a destructive and a protective reaction.
However, PrP(Sc) from mice infected with a range of TSE strains retained similar resistance to proteinase K digestion after heating to below or above these temperatures, showing that the properties of PrP(Sc) responsible for proteinase resistance do not correlate with those conferring thermostability on the TSE agent.
The simplest explanation of these data is that the causal agent contains a macromolecular component that is structurally independent of the host, that it varies covalently between TSE strains, and that it is protected by other macromolecular components.
The model is in accord with the virino hypothesis, which proposes a host-independent informational molecule protected by the host protein PrP.

Abstract: Diagnosis of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is confirmed by specified laboratory methods on brain material.
On the other hand clinical signs of manifest BSE are quite obvious.
The first part of this paper describes case histories, clinical signs, laboratory findings and the most common differential diagnoses.
On the basis of the data of actual prevalence in Germany, the role of clinical examination in eradication of BSE is dealt in the second part.
Clinical diagnosis is a very sensitive and specific method when there is a high prevalence.
According to the data from December 2000 to November 2001 prevalence in Germany was beyond 1 BSE case per 100,000 cattle or 3 cases per 100,000 cows.
This very low prevalence decreases rapidly sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis made by clinical examination.
Therefore the main focus of field-diagnostics has to be laid on specified laboratory diagnostic methods.
On the other hand prevalence of BSE-positive cattle is distinctly higher in the group of animals slaughtered in cases of illness or emergency than in cattle slaughtered on the regulatory bases.
Nevertheless every veterinary practitioner should be aware of the clinical picture of BSE, clinical examination-routine and differential diagnosis, because occurrence of BSE is still possible in any dairy herd.
At the moment it is not possible to make any statement if eradication of BSE can be reached in future.

Expression of cellular prion-related protein by murine Langerhans cells and keratinocytes.
Journal of Dermatological Science.
February, 2002; 28 (2): 126-134.
ISSN: 0923-1811.
Journal URL: www.elsevier.com/locate/jdermsci Abstract: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are characterized by the accumulation of a proteinase-resistant isoform of the cellular prion-related protein (PrPc) within the central nervous system (CNS).
The accumulation of scrapie-associated PrP (PrPSc) within cells of the lymphoreticular system prior to its accumulation in the CNS is regarded as important for the development of neurological diseases after peripheral inoculation.
Little, however, is known as to which cells are the targets for peripheral inoculation.
Here, the presence of PrPc on murine Langerhans cells (LC), dendritic cells in the skin and mucosa, and keratinocytes (KC) is demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining, Western-blotting and FACS analysis.
The expression of PrPc mRNA in freshly purified LC and KC was also detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
The expression of PrPc on LC was slightly increased during culture.
These data suggest that LC and KC may be the targets for peripheral infection with prions.

The identification of several distinct classes of prion inhibitors has created an opportunity to investigate the mechanism of prion formation using pharmacological tools.
These new inhibitors include substituted tricyclic derivatives, tetrapyrrole compounds, cysteine protease inhibitors, branched polyamines, and specific antibodies.
Each inhibitor class contains at least one active compound that inhibits prion propagation in cell culture at sub-micromolar concentrations and several structurally related, inactive compounds.
Work with branched polyamines and specific antibodies has already provided insight into the kinetics and cell biology of endogenous prion clearance mechanisms.
Other anti-prion compounds do not appear to bind directly to the prion protein.
Detailed investigation of the mechanism of drug action of these compounds may lead to the identification of novel prion propagation factors.

ISSN: 0022-1317.
Abstract: Late onset ataxia reported in three independently derived PrP null lines of mice has been attributed to the overexpression of the doppel protein in the CNS of these mice rather than to the loss of PrP.
The central role of PrP in the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), the proximity of the gene which encodes doppel (Prnd) to the PrP gene (Prnp) and the structural similarity shared by PrP and doppel have led to the proposition that ataxia which develops during TSE disease could, in part, be due to doppel.
In order to address this hypothesis, we have crossed our two inbred lines of PrP null mice, which either express (RCM) or do not express (NPU) the Prnd gene in the CNS, with mice expressing two Prnp(a[108F189V]) alleles of the PrP gene.
We have found that the TSE infection does not influence the level of expression of Prnd in the CNS at the terminal stages of disease.
Moreover, we have demonstrated that the level of expression of Prnd in the CNS has no influence on the incubation period, vacuolar pathology nor amount or distribution of deposition in the brains of the TSE-infected mice.
Doppel has therefore no apparent influence on the outcome of TSE disease in transgenic mice, suggesting it is unlikely to be involved in the naturally occurring TSE diseases in other species.

Abstract: Outside Great Britain, the number of clinical cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) seems to be rising.
It is unclear whether this increase is real, or whether it is caused by improved recognition and improved registration of BSE.
A strict and independent control of the implementation of measures intended to keep human food free of the BSE agent is imperative.

Abstract: Specific conditions and practices of cattle feeding in Germany have to be taken into account for assessing the risk of feed born transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, especially regarding the situation before the year 2000 when specific directives were introduced for feed production.
The present retrospective epidemiological study includes data on feed production and the estimated amount of animal derived feedstuffs for the production of compounded feed for cattle.
Risk assessment was performed based on the 'reproduction rate' (R0), that is defined as the estimated number of infections resulting from the processing of brain and spinal cord of BSE affected cattle that is recycled to bovines via feed.
Under the conditions as given in Germany until the year 2000 the reproduction rate of BSE via the inclusion of animal derived feedstuffs in compounded feed production for cattle was estimated to be 1.1.
Thus, it can be expected that BSE could be reproduced in the system, but with comparatively low efficiency.
The expected incidence of BSE should be considerably lower compared to the situation during the 90th in the UK, due to the markedly lower recycling rate of animal protein in cattle feeding.
Animal fat could have been a significant factor for BSE transmission due to contamination by proteinaceous brain and spinal cord material during the production process.
The relative significance of fat containing feedstuffs for BSE transmission could have been higher in Germany compared to the situation in the UK where meat and bone meal was produced under different conditions and frequently used in higher proportions as an ingredient for compounded feed for ruminants.

Molecular analysis of the abnormal prion protein during coinfection of mice by bovine spongiform encephalopathy and a scrapie agent.
Journal of Virology.
Jan. 2001.
v. 75 (1) p. 107-114.
Abstract: Molecular features of the proteinase K-resistant prion protein (PrP res) may discriminate among prion strains, and a specific signature could be found during infection by the infectious agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
To investigate the molecular basis of BSE adaptation and selection, we established a model of coinfection of mice by both BSE and a sheep scrapie strain (C506M3).
We now show that the PrP res features in these mice, characterized by glycoform ratios and electrophoretic mobilities, may be undistinguishable from those found in mice infected with scrapie only, including when mice were inoculated by both strains at the same time and by the same intracerebral inoculation route.
Western blot analysis using different antibodies against sequences near the putative N-terminal end of PrP res also demonstrated differences in the main proteinase K cleavage sites between mice showing either the BSE or scrapie PrP res profile.
These results, which may be linked to higher levels of PrP res associated with infection by scrapie, were similar following a challenge by a higher dose of the BSE agent during coinfection by both strains intracerebrally.
Whereas PrP res extraction methods used allowed us to distinguish type 1 and type 2 PrP res, differing, like BSE and scrapie, by their electrophoretic mobilities, in the same brain region of some patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, analysis of in vitro mixtures of BSE and scrapie brain homogenates did not allow us to distinguish BSE and scrapie PrP res.
These results suggest that the BSE agent, the origin of which remains unknown so far but which may have arisen from a sheep scrapie agent, may be hidden by a scrapie strain during attempts to identify it by molecular studies and following transmission of the disease in mice.

Archives of Neurology.
2001 Oct. 58(10): 1673-1678 ISSN: 0003-9942 Abstract: BACKGROUND: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk occur in the United States.
Recent reports of 3 unusually young patients with CJD who regularly consumed deer or elk meat created concern about the possible zoonotic transmission of CWD.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the possible transmission of CWD to humans.
PATIENTS: Three unusually young patients (aged 28, 28, and 30 years) with CJD in the United States during 1997-2000.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records and interviewed family members and state wildlife and agriculture officials.
Brain tissue samples were tested using histopathologic, immunohistochemical, immunoblot, or prion protein gene analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence or absence of established CJD risk factors, deer and elk hunting in CWD-endemic areas, and comparison of the evidence for the 3 patients with that of a zoonotic link between new variant CJD and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
RESULTS: None of the patients had established CJD risk factors or a history of travel to Europe.
Two patients hunted game animals and 1 was a daughter of a hunter.
Unlike patients with new variant CJD, the 3 patients did not have a unique neuropathologic manifestation, clinicopathologic homogeneity, uniformity in the codon 129 of the prion protein gene, or prion characteristics different from those of classic variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the occurrence of 3 unusually young patients with CJD who consumed venison suggested a possible relationship with CWD, our follow-up investigation found no strong evidence for a causal link.
Ongoing CJD surveillance remains important for continuing to assess the risk, if any, of CWD transmission to humans.

A better understanding of the molecular strain determinants could be obtained from cells in monoculture than from whole animal studies where different cell targeting is commonly a strain-related feature.
Although a few cell types can be infected with different strains, the phenotypes of the emergent strains have not been studied.
We have cured the scrapie-infected, clonal SMB cell line with pentosan sulfate, stably re-infected it with a different strain of scrapie and shown that biological properties and prion protein profiles characteristic of each original strain are propagated faithfully in this single non-neuronal cell type.
These findings attest to the fact that scrapie strain determinants are stable and host-independent in isolated cells.

Emerging Infectious Diseases 2001 Jan-Feb. 7(1): 6-16 ISSN: 1080-6040 Abstract:
The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom, which began in 1986 and has affected nearly 200,000 cattle, is waning to a conclusion, but leaves in its wake an outbreak of human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, most probably resulting from the consumption of beef products contaminated by central nervous system tissue.
Although averaging only 10-15 cases a year since its first appearance in 1994, its future magnitude and geographic distribution (in countries that have imported infected British cattle or cattle products, or have endogenous BSE) cannot yet be predicted.
The possibility that large numbers of apparently healthy persons might be incubating the disease raises concerns about iatrogenic transmissions through instrumentation (surgery and medical diagnostic procedures) and blood and organ donations.
Government agencies in many countries continue to implement new measures to minimize this risk.

Abstract:
Prion diseases have been popularized by extensive media coverage of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease" epidemic, observed in Great Britain since 1986, and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD), reported for the first time in 1996.
In contrast to the classical form of the disease, nvCJD affects younger patients, presents a relatively longer duration of illness and is caused by the same agent as BSE.
Evidence from laboratory studies now strongly supports the hypothesis that new variant represents human form of animal disease, linked to exposure, probably through food, to bovine prions.
Number of BSE reports in the United Kingdom began to decline in 1993, and has continuously decreased year by year since then, but a great worry spread in European countries in association with new BSE reported cases outside of the Great Britain, and increasing incidence of nvCJD.
New epidemiological, clinical, histopathological and experimental data on prion diseases are reviewed, focusing our attention on the possible transmission of prion proteins from animals to humans.

51(3-4): 245-257 ISSN: 0167-5877 Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of tracing and compliance encountered in setting up and maintaining a UK-wide 5-year observational study of beef cattle.
The 5-year prospective study was initiated in 1997 to investigate the occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a single herd of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle, in which BSE had been detected at low prevalence.
The study was given the acronym ULiSES (University of Liverpool Spongiform Encephalopathy Scheme).
All cattle present on the farm at the start of the scheme were registered as members of the study population (n=320), as were all calves standard histopathological techniques) for the presence of spongiform change.
Remaining samples were stored at -70 degrees C for future investigation by alternative tests.
At the halfway point of the scheme in October 1999, 75.2% (506/673) of the study population was still alive; 42% (284) of the population was still alive on the study farm and 33% (222) was distributed on other farms throughout the UK.
Complete sets of specimens had been recovered from 77% (129/167) of dead animals.
All brainstem sections were negative by histopathological examination.
No suspect cases of BSE were reported in ULiSES animals.
Failure to recover specimens occurred principally in animals which had left the study farm.
The main cause of specimen loss was a failure of compliance in a small number of individuals who had purchased large numbers of ULiSES animals, and subsequently slaughtered them without contacting the University.
Despite this, farmer compliance was generally high.
The ULiSES scheme shows the feasibility of a country-wide longitudinal observational study spanning a period of several years and indicates the large impact of small numbers of non-compliant individuals.

24: 519-550 ISSN: 0147-006X Abstract: Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative conditions that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie in animals.
Prions appear to be composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of a host-encoded glycoprotein, prion protein.
Prion propagation involves recruitment of host cellular prion protein, composed primarily of alpha-helical structure, into a disease specific isoform rich in beta-sheet structure.
The existence of multiple prion strains has been difficult to explain in terms of a protein-only infections agent, but recent studies suggest that strain specific phenotypes can be encoded by different prion protein conformations and glycosylation patterns.
The ability of a protein to encode phenotypic information has important biological implications.
The appearance of a novel human prion disease, variant CJD, and the clear experimental evidence that it is caused by exposure to BSE has highlighted the need to understand the molecular basis of prion propagation, pathogenesis, and the barriers limiting intermammalian transmission.
It is unclear if a large epidemic of variant CJD will occur in the years ahead.

2001 Sep. 12(9): 729-733 ISSN: 0938-8990 Abstract: The doppel protein (Dpl) is a prion-like protein encoded by the gene PRND, which has been found downstream of the prion gene, PRNP, in human and mouse.
This paper describes the isolation and structural organization of the bovine and ovine PRND genes, which are composed of two exons compared with the three of human and mouse.
Intergenic distances between PRNP and PRND were covered by means of long-range PCR and found to be 16.8 and 20 kb, in cattle and sheep respectively.
The 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) were analyzed to identify transcription regulatory sequences and compared with those from the PRND and PRNP sequences published for other species.
Three polymorphisms (R50H, N110H, and R132Q) were revealed in the cattle coding region; two synonymous substitutions (I12I, A26A) were found in sheep.
None of the polymorphisms was significantly associated with either Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle or scrapie in sheep.

2001 Feb. 12(2): 150-156 ISSN: 0938-8990 Abstract: A novel gene, rasfadin (RASSF2) was identified close to the bovine prion gene, and its genomic structure was derived with a combination of exon trapping and RACE.
The gene covers at least 28 kb and maps to the same chromosomal region as the prion gene in cattle, sheep, and human.
The RASSF2 ORF is composed of 987 base pairs divided into nine exons and shows a high nucleotide (88%) and amino acid similarity (95%) with a previously described human cDNA, KIAA0168.
The bovine 3'UTR region is significantly shorter than the human counterpart, but shares with it two highly conserved nucleotide blocks.
The expression of the gene was investigated in brain, liver, and spleen.
Alternative splicing yields a shorter product in the liver composed of only four exons.
Computer analysis showed a highly significant similarity of the rasfadin protein with the Ras association (Ral-GDS/AF-6) domain family 2 and with the afadin family, respectively, for the longer brain/spleen and the shorter liver variants.

Abstract:
Bovine brain tissue samples from 625 UK cattle, clinically suspected as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cases, were used in a blind analysis to assess a rapid Western immunoblotting technique (Prionics Check; Prionics AG, Zurich), which detects bovine disease-specific protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(Sc)).
By means of statutory histopathological examination, 599 of the 625 cattle were confirmed as BSE cases by the demonstration of spongiform encephalopathy, the remaining 26 being classified as negative.
Duplicate samples from the same animals were also examined by electron microscopy for the presence of abnormal brain fibrils (scrapie-associated fibrils; SAFs).
The Prionics technique showed a high sensitivity, particularly when compared with the fibril detection test; the detection rates were 99.3% and 92.0% respectively, with histopathology being used as the "gold standard".
The false negative results by the Prionics test were possibly related to the sampling procedure.
Analysis of 50 BSE-positive samples revealed similar glycoprofiles, the majority of PrP(Sc)isoforms being di-glycosylated protein.
The Prionics test also detected PrP(Sc)in the four brain samples from the 26 histopathologically negative animals, apparently reducing the specificity of the test to 84.6%; however, confirmatory positive results in these samples were obtained by demonstrating SAF or by immunohistochemical examination, or both.
It was concluded that the Prionics test detected PrP(Sc)in a small percentage (0.64%) of clinically suspected BSE cases showing no spongiform change.
Since January 2000, the Prionics Western blot test has been introduced as one of the statutory tests for the diagnosis of clinically suspected BSE and scrapie cases in the UK.

Here, we summarize current information bearing on the natural history, pathobiology and epidemiology of these disorders and public policy responses to the potential threats to public health posed, particularly, by bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).
Six years after the first case reports of vCJD, there is still no clear indication of the magnitude of the primary epidemic, or of the likelihood of lateral transmission of this untreatable disease by iatrogenic means, particularly by blood and blood products.
However, the unsettling nature of the available evidence warrants prudence regarding public health policy and regulation, as well as a forward-looking approach to research.

357(9261): 1002-1007 ISSN: 0140-6736 Abstract: BACKGROUND: Geographical variation in the distribution of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) might indicate the transmission route of the infectious agent to man.
We investigated whether regional incidences of vCJD were correlated with regional dietary data.
METHODS: The National CJD Surveillance Unit prospectively identified 84 people with vCJD up to Nov 10, 2000, in Great Britain.
Their lifetime residential histories were obtained by interviews with a close relative.
Cumulative incidences of vCJD by standard region were calculated.
Grid references for places of residence in 1991 were identified and evidence of geographical clusters were sought.
Data on diet in the 1980s were analysed for regional correlations with vCJD incidence.
The socioeconomic status of the places of residence of people with vCJD was compared with that of the general population.
FINDINGS: vCJD incidence was higher in the north of Great Britain than the south.
The rate ratio (north vs south) was 1.94 (95% CI 1.27-2.98).
The mean Carstairs' deprivation score for areas of residence of people with vCJD was -0.09 (-0.73 to 0.55), which is close to the national average of zero.
Regional rates of vCJD were correlated with consumption of other meat or meat products as classified and recorded by the Household Food Consumption and Expenditure Survey (r=0.72), but not with data from the Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults.
Five people with vCJD in Leicestershire formed a cluster (p=0.004).
INTERPRETATION: Regional differences in vCJD incidence are unlikely to be due to ascertainment bias.
We had difficulty determining whether regional variations in diet might cause these differences, since the results of dietary analyses were inconsistent.

Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research; Revue Canadienne de Recherche Veterinaire.
2001 Apr. 65(2): 131-132 ISSN: 0830-9000 Abstract: Early epidemiological information indicated that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) originated from scrapie in sheep.
The question arose if scrapie in North America would induce a BSE-like disease in cattle.
Six years ago, we reported that brain tissue from sheep with scrapie caused a neurologic disease when injected directly into the brains of cattle, but the disease induced was different from BSE as it occurs in the United Kingdom and Europe.

Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry 2001 Dec. 49(12): 1519-1524 ISSN: 0022-1554 Abstract: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a transmissible neurodegenerative disease of cattle.
Clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by investigation of both spongiform changes and abnormal prion protein (PrPsc), a marker considered specific for the disease.
Tissue autolysis, often unavoidable in routine field cases, is not compatible with histological examination of the brain even though PrPsc is still detectable by immunoblotting.
To determine how autolysis might affect accurate diagnosis using PrPsc immunohistochemistry, we studied 50 field samples of BSE brainstem (obex) with various degrees of autolysis.
We demonstrated that the antigen-unmasking pretreatments necessary for PrPsc immunohistochemistry were compatible with the preservation of autolyzed brain sections and that PrPsc detection was unaffected by autolysis, even though anatomic markers were sometimes lost.
In tissue samples in which anatomic sites were still recognizable, PrPsc accumulation was detected in specific gray matter nuclei.
In samples with advanced autolysis, PrPsc deposits were still observed, at least at the cellular level, as an intraneuronal pattern.
We found that the sensitivity of PrPsc immunohistochemistry as a diagnostic method for BSE was undiminished even by severe tissue autolysis.

Abstract:
In Switzerland, the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was diagnosed in November 1990.
Case numbers peaked in 1995, with a total of 352 BSE cases identified by 30 April 2000.
Reporting of clinically suspect cattle is currently the most commonly used method world-wide to detect BSE cases.
The effectiveness of mandatory reporting depends on a variety of factors; for other diseases passive surveillance underestimates the incidence of clinical cases.
The efficiency of passive surveillance systems for BSE will remain unknown until screening tests able to identify clinically affected cattle have been applied in several countries.
This paper provides the first detailed description of a targeted screening programme for BSE.
Two populations of cows 
Between 1992 and 1999, on average 81 clinical BSE suspects per year were reported to the veterinary authorities (passive surveillance), of which 43% were confirmed with BSE.
A total of 30 clinical cases were captured by passive surveillance and an additional 20 BSE cases detected by targeted screening between May 1999 and April 2000.
The odds of finding a BSE case was 49 times higher in the fallen stock and 58 times higher in emergency-slaughtered cattle when compared to passive surveillance.
The targeted screening of fallen stock and emergency-slaughtered cattle considerably increased the number of detected cases in this 12-month period.
Targeted-screening cases were on average 4 months younger than the clinical suspect cases.
In conclusion, post-mortem testing of fallen stock and emergency-slaughtered cows 
Without ante-mortem screening tests to detect BSE-infected cattle during the incubation period, a combination of effectively functioning passive and active BSE surveillance strategies might be the only approach to assess the BSE situation reliably in a given country or region - and it is necessary to substantiate claims of freedom from the disease.

Abstract: This paper compares the clinical signs, histopathology, detection of PrPSc protein and PrP genetics of the transmission of BSE to sheep and goats, with the effects of the transmission of natural scrapie from a brain homogenate from a single sheep.
After intracerebral and oral inoculations there were similarities in the clinical signs due to the two sources of infection, but there were differences in pathology at the end stage of disease and in the genotypes of the sheep which succumbed to the challenges.
The incubation period of BSE was associated with the sheep PrP codon 171 genotype, but the natural scrapie source, despite inducing disease only in known susceptible genotypes, showed no clear association with PrP genotype.

Despite a wide range of incubation period lengths, affected sheep showed a similar distribution of high levels of PrP(Sc) throughout the central nervous system.
PrP(Sc) was also found in the lymphoid system, including parts of the digestive tract, and some components of the peripheral nervous system.
These abundant PrP(Sc) deposits in sheep in regions outside the central nervous system are in direct contrast with cattle infected with BSE, which show barely detectable levels of PrP(Sc) in peripheral tissues.
A number of genetically susceptible, challenged animals appear to have survived.

ISSN: 0022-1317 Abstract: The diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) depends on the detection of vacuolation in brain sections taken from affected individuals and/or the identification of the disease-associated isoform of the PrP (prion) protein (PrP(Sc)).
During the course of an investigation, goats clinically affected following experimental infection with three different sources of TSE (SSBP/1, CH1641 and BSE) developed widespread vacuolar degeneration in the brain.
With BSE, PrP(Sc) was clearly recognized in affected goat brain by immunocytochemistry (icc) and Western blotting, but in contrast the experimental scrapie sources SSBP/1 and CH1641 showed almost no or very little PrP(Sc) by icc.
Western blot analysis of PrP(Sc) from BSE-affected and SSBP/1-affected goat brain showed that the protein was present in brain affected by both TSE sources, but could not be used to determine how much protein was present.
It became clear that PrP(Sc) and vacuolation could be partially dissociated following challenge with two of the three TSE sources.
Subtle differences in glycosylation patterns between BSE- and SSBP/1-associated PrP protein isoforms could also be recognized, although these experimentally generated results should not be regarded as a BSE/scrapie differential test.
However, our study warns that the reliance on PrP(Sc) determination by icc alone as a means by which to diagnose TSE infection may generate false negative results.

International Review of Cytology 2001.
208: 121-160 ISSN: 0074-7696 Abstract: The normal cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a membrane sialoglycoprotein of unknown function having the unique property of adopting an abnormal tertiary conformation.
The pathological conformer PrP(sc) would be the agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases.
They include scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.
The conversion of PrP(c) into PrP(sc) in the brain governs the clinical phenotype of the disease.
However, the three-dimensional structure change of PrP(c) can also take place outside the central nervous system, in nonneuronal cells particularly of lymphoid tissue where the agent replicates.
In natural infection, PrP(c) in nonneuronal cells of peripheral extracerebral organs may play a key role as the receptor required to enable the entry of the infectious agent into the host.
In the present review we have undertaken a first evaluation of compelling data concerning the PrP(c)-expressing cells of nonneuronal origin present in cerebral and extracerebral tissues.
The analysis of tissue, cellular, and subcellular localization of PrP(c) may help us better understand the biological function of PrP(c) and provide some information on physiopathological processes underlying prion diseases.

v. 91 (2) p. 191-205.
ISSN: 1364-5072 Abstract: This paper considers the development of microbiological risk assessment models for pathogenic agents in drinking water with particular reference to Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The available evidence suggests that there is potential for considerable variation in exposures to C. parvum oocysts through drinking water, during both outbreak and non-outbreak conditions.
This spatial/temporal heterogeneity arises both from variation in oocyst densities in the raw water and fluctuations in the removal efficiencies of drinking water treatment.
In terms of risk prediction, modeling the variation in doses ingested by individual drinking water consumers is not important if the dose-response curve is linear and the oocysts act independently during infection.
Indeed, the total pathogen loading on the population as represented by the arithmetic mean exposure is sufficient for risk prediction for C. parvum, BSE and other agents of low infectivity, providing the infecting particles (i.e. oocysts or BSE prions) are known to act independently.
However, for more highly infectious agents, such as rotavirus, ignoring the variation and just using the arithmetic mean exposure may over-estimate the risk by a factor of about threefold.
If it were to be shown that pathogens co-operate with each other during initiation of infection, such that the dose-response relationship is non-linear, then modelling the variation in doses ingested by individual consumers would be very important.
Possible mechanisms for co-operation of pathogens during infection are considered.
Simulations show that acquired protective immunity for C. parvum reduces the risk of infection during outbreak conditions by over 10-fold.
Variation in virulence between strains of C. parvum is a further source of uncertainty.

2001 Jan. 124(1): 52-59 ISSN: 0021-9975 Abstract: The histological changes in the brains of 506 clinically normal 7-year-old cattle, which were part of a cohort study on maternal transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, are described.
Vacuolation of the white matter, of unknown aetiology, located particularly in the substantia nigra, was a frequent finding.
Vacuolated neurons were commonly observed in the red nucleus (64.3% of the animals) and in the habenular nucleus (50.1%).
Spheroids were found in 10.8% of the brains, most frequently in the vestibular nuclei.
Cellular inflammatory infiltrates in association with blood vessels occurred in 30% of the animals at various locations in the brain; their aetiology remains uncertain, but they may have reflected subclinical or latent infections.
Mineralization of the wall of blood vessels, with proliferation of the intima, was observed frequently in vessels of the internal capsule and was probably associated with ageing.
The description of histological findings in the brain of symptomless adult cattle in the present study provides a useful background for diagnostic bovine neuropathology.

Medical Journal of Australia, 2001 Aug 6.
175(3): 154-158 ISSN: 0025-729X Abstract:
The bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epizootic developed in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s.
Feeding practices in the cattle industry amplified the causative prion, and meat contaminated with BSE entered the market.
Human consumption of prion-contaminated meat led to the new zoonosis--variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).
The UK BSE Inquiry published its report in October 2000; while praising policy decisions, it also documented failures in the execution of these policies, specifically delays and lack of rigour.
Australia is in an excellent position to maintain its BSE- and scrapie-free status, but widespread active surveillance of neural and non-neural tissue from all species of farmed quadrupeds is needed.

Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

2001 Mar 22.
268(1467): 587-592 ISSN: 0962-8452 Abstract:
A postal survey of British sheep farmers provided information on the proportion of farms that experienced their first case of scrapie in each year between 1962 and 1998.
We found no evidence of a large increase in the proportion of scrapie-affected farms prior to, during or following the epidemic of BSE in British cattle.
After correcting for between-farm heterogeneity in the probability of acquiring scrapie, we estimated the yearly between-flock force of infection since 1962.
The current force of infection is estimated at approximately 0.0045 per farm per year and combined with a simple model of scrapie spread provides an estimate of the average duration of a scrapie outbreak on an individual farm.
Considering all farms, the average outbreak lasts for five years, but if only those farms that have cases in animals born on the farm are considered, it lasts 15 years.
We use these parameter estimates to compare the proportion of farms with scrapie in time periods of different lengths.
In the survey, 2.7% of farms had a case in 1998.
The 5.3% of farms reporting having a case between 1993 and 1997 is consistent with the hypothesis that the scrapie force of infection remained constant over this period.
