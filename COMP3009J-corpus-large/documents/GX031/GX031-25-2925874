S19.30 2) As the need arises, ship stations and ship earth stations to which the provisions of Chapter SIX apply, and coast stations or coast earth stations capable of communicating with such ship stations, shall have assigned to them maritime mobile service identities in accordance with Section VI of this Article.
S19.31 3) It is not compulsory to assign call signs from the international series to stations identified by maritime mobile service identities or which are easily identified by other means (see No. S19.16) and whose signals of identification or characteristics of emission are published in international documents.
S19.32 Â§ 13 Should the available call sign series in Appendix S42 be exhausted, new call sign series may be allocated according to the principles set out in Resolution 13 (Rev.WRC-97) relating to the formation of call signs and the allocation of new international series.

S19.36 Â§ 17 A single maritime identification digit (MID) has been allocated initially to each administration.
A second MID should not be requested unless the first MID allocated is more than 80% exhausted in the basic category of three trailing zeros and the rate of assignments is such that 90% exhaustion is foreseen.
The same criteria should be applied to subsequent requests for MIDs.
S19.37 Â§ 18 The Secretary-General shall be responsible for supplying series of selective call numbers or signals (see Nos. S19.92 to S19.95) at the request of the administrations concerned.

These notifications do not include call signs assigned to amateur and experimental stations.
S19.39 2) Each administration shall choose the maritime mobile service identities of its stations from the maritime identification digits allocated to it and notify this information to the Secretary-General for inclusion in the relevant lists, as provided for in Article S20.

Administrations shall notify the Bureau immediately in accordance with No. S20.16 when assigning selective call numbers to ship stations.
S19.96A 3) Five-digit ship station selective call numbers are assigned to sequential single frequency selective calling (SSFC) equipment (as described in Recommendation ITU-R M.257-3) for calling in radiotelephony and for the phasing in of narrow-band direct printing (NBDP) equipment (as described in Recommendation ITU-R M.476-5).

S19.97 4) Each administration shall choose the coast station identification numbers to be assigned to its coast stations from the blocks of the series supplied to it.
S19.98 A - General
S19.99 Â§ 39 When a station* in the maritime mobile service or the maritime mobile-satellite service is required to use maritime mobile service identities, the responsible administration shall assign the identity to the station in accordance with the provisions described in Nos. S19.100 to S19.126; in so doing, it should take into account the relevant ITU-R and ITU-T Recommendations.
In accordance with No. S20.16, administrations shall notify the Bureau immediately when assigning maritime mobile service identities
S19.100 Â§ 40 1) Maritime mobile service identities are formed of a series of nine digits which are transmitted over the radio path in order to uniquely identify ship stations, ship earth stations, coast stations, coast earth stations and group calls.
S19.101 2) These identities are formed in such a way that the identity or part thereof can be used by telephone and telex subscribers connected to the general telecommunications network principally to call ships automatically in the shore-to-ship direction.
S19.102 3) There are four kinds of maritime mobile service identities:
S19.103 i) ship station identities;
S19.104 ii) group ship station call identities
S19.105 iii) coast station identities;
S19.106 iv) group coast station call identities.
S19.107 Not used.
S19.108 B - Maritime identification digits (MIDs)
S19.109 Â§ 42 These provisions do not require an administration to assign numerical identities until it determines that such identities are necessary.
They do not concern the assignment of ship station identities without trailing zeros, since it is assumed that there is enough capacity inherent in the system to provide for the assignment of such identities to all ship stations which an administration may wish to identify in this manner.
S19.110 C - Ship station identities
S19.111 Â§ 43 1) Administrations should:
S19.112 a) follow the guidelines contained in the relevant ITU-R and ITU-T Recommendations for the assignment of ship station identities;
S19.113 b) make optimum use of the possibilities of forming identities from the single MID allocated to them;
S19.114 c) take particular care in assigning ship station identities with six significant digits (three-trailing-zero identities), which should be assigned only to ship stations which can reasonably be expected to require such an identity for automatic access on a world-wide basis for public switched networks;
S19.115 d) assign one-trailing-zero or two-trailing-zero identities to vessels when they require automatic access only on a national or regional level, as defined in the relevant ITU-T Recommendations;
S19.116 e) assign ship station identities without trailing zeros to all other vessels requiring a numerical identification.
S19.117 2) The 9-digit code constituting a ship station identity is formed as follows:
M1I2D3X4X5X6X7X8X9
wherein
M1I2D3
represent the maritime identification digits and X is any figure from 0 to 9.
S19.118 D - Group ship station call identities
S19.119 Â§ 44 1) Group ship station call identities for calling simultaneously more than one ship are formed as follows:
01M2I3D4X5X6X7X8X9
where the first figure is zero and X is any figure from 0 to 9.
S19.120 2) The MID represents only the territory or geographical area of the administration assigning the group ship station call identity and does not therefore prevent group calls to fleets containing more than one ship nationality.
S19.121 E - Coast station identities
S19.122 Â§ 45 1) Coast station identities are formed as follows:
0102M3I4D5X6X7X8X9
where the first two figures are zeros and X is any figure from 0 to 9.
S19.123 2) The MID reflects the territory or geographical area in which the coast station or coast earth station is located.
S19.124 F - Group coast station call identities
S19.125 Â§ 46 1) Group coast station call identities for calling simultaneously more than one coast station are formed as a subset of coast station identities, as follows:
0102M3I4D5X6X7X8X9
where the first two figures are zeros and X is any figure from 0 to 9.
S19.126 2) The MID represents only the territory or geographical area of the administration assigning the group coast station call identity.
The identity may be assigned to stations of one administration which are located in only one geographical region as indicated in the relevant ITU-T Recommendations.
S19.127 Â§ 47 1) In the aeronautical mobile service, after communication has been established by means of the complete call sign, the aircraft station may use, if confusion is unlikely to arise, an abbreviated call sign or identification consisting of:
S19.128 a) in radiotelegraphy, the first character and last two letters of the complete call sign (see No. S19.58);
S19.129 b) in radiotelephony:
- the first character of the complete call sign; or - the abbreviation of the name of the owner of the aircraft (company or individual); or - the type of aircraft; followed by the last two letters of the complete call sign (see No. S19.58) or by the last two characters of the registration mark.
S19.130 2) The provisions of Nos. S19.127, S19.128 and S19.129 may be amplified or modified by agreement between administrations concerned.
S19.131 Â§ 48 The distinguishing signals allotted to ships for visual and aural signalling shall, in general, agree with the call signs of ship stations.
S20.1 Â§ 1 The following documents shall be published by the Secretary-General.
As circumstances warrant and in response to individual requests by administrations, the published information shall also be available in computer printed form, machine readable form, film, microfiche or by other appropriate means.
S20.2 Â§ 2 List I - The International Frequency List.
S20.3 This list shall contain:
S20.4 a) particulars of frequency assignments recorded in the Master International Frequency Register;
S20.5 b) the frequencies (e.g. 500 kHz or 2 182 kHz) prescribed by these Regulations for common use by certain services;
