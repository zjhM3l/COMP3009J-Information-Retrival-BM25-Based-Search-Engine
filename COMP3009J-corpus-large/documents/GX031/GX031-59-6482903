Preface
Euthanatizing agents are commonly categorized into three main categories: inhalant agents, noninhalant pharmacologic agents, and physical methods.
The inhalant agents include anesthetic gases, ether, cyclopropane, nitrous oxide, halothane, methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, nitrogen gas, and hydrogen cyanide gas.
They are administered to the animal via a closed chamber, container, or face mask.
The noninhalant agents include injectable pharmacologic agents.
The preferred route of administration of the noninhalants is by intravenous injection.
Physical methods of euthanasia include the use of the captive bolt pistol, gunshot, cervical dislocation, decapitation, electrocution, microwave irradiation, and rapid freezing.
The 1993 Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia is frequently referred to by the veterinary and biomedical communities and provides guidelines for recommended euthanitization methods by animal group and species.
Personnel administering an euthanatizing agent must consider: 1) whether the agent is appropriate for the species, 2) the route, dose, and concentration of the agent that should be administered, 3) if the agent may result in fear behavior, pain, struggling, or vocalizations, 4) how rapidly the agent results in unconsciousness, 5) if the agent causes tissue changes, 6) the technical skills for appropriate administration, and 7) if the agent is economical.
If the animal is a pet, veterinary or shelter personnel must also address the emotional needs of the owner.
This Special Reference Brief (SRB) is designed for use by veterinarians, shelter personnel, pet owners, researchers, agriculturists, and zoologists.
Bibliographic citations on euthanatizing methods for a variety of animal species in different circumstances are listed.
The citations include references from professional journals and books indexed multiple resources including MEDLINE and AGRICOLA databases.
Citations cover the publication years 1990 to November 1997.

The Art of Veterinary Practice: A Guide to Client Communication.
Milani MM 1995, xiv + 294 pp.; many ref (1995) Descriptors: death; fees; therapy; animal behavior
Abstract: The fact that the client-patient-veterinarian relationship is not only seen as a subject to light-hearted jokes, is probably a sign of the times, and this author takes a timely and serious look at this often neglected area of veterinary practice.
The book provides not only practical advice on how to cope with difficult clients, euthanasia, animal rights, alternative therapies and fees but addresses the deeper issues of practitioner burnout, owner-animal relationship and owner's guilt providing, new and refreshing insights into these unspoken aspects of a veterinarian's life.
All in all a good bedtime read for both large and small animal practitioners.
The author is a veterinary practitioner herself and her own experience gives the book a touch of reality.
The book has a subject index and a valuable collection of references.

Abstract: In central New York State, USA, arthropod succession was observed on whole rat carcasses euthanized by CO2 anoxia and sodium pentobarbital (SP) overdose.
Adult Diptera accounted for 84% (417 of 494) of all arthropods collected, of which 76% (319 of 417) were Calliphoridae.
Calliphorid oviposition on SP euthanized rats was protracted throughout the first 7 days of putrefaction compared to CO2 euthanized rats.
Seventy-one percent (353 of 494) of adult arthropods were associated with SP euthanized rats and SP rats took twice as long to decompose.
Arthropod succession and development on rat carcasses was most likely influenced by manner of death.

Finnie, J. W. Journal of Comparative Pathology v.109(3): p.253-258 (1993) Descriptors: sheep; parenchyma; consciousness; euthanasia; vascular damage
Abstract: The neuropathological changes produced by a captive bolt pistol are described.
The primary wound track in the brain was similar to that inflicted by a weapon such as a .22 calibre rifle.
However neural and vascular damage at a distance from the primary wound canal was much less severe and widespread after penetration of the low velocity captive bolt projectile due to the formation of a smaller temporary wound cavity by radial forces imparted to the parenchyma.
These findings suggest that the use of a captive bolt pistol for euthanasia should be immediately followed by further actions to ensure that an animal is rendered permanently unconscious.

Descriptors: inhalation; stress; animal-behavior; brain; heart rate; electroencephalograms; electrocardiograms; animal welfare; brain activity
Abstract: This paper records the effects of carbon dioxide when used for euthanasia, on behaviour, electrical brain activity and heart rate in rats.
Four different methods were used.
Animals were placed in a box (a) that was completely filled with carbon dioxide; (b) into which carbon dioxide was streamed at a high flow rate; (c)into which carbon dioxide was streamed at a low flow rate and (d) into which a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen was streamed at a fast rate.
It was found that the cessation of behaviour was associated with an aberrant pattern of electrical brain activity together with an abnormally low heart rate.
The time to reach this point was shortest in those animals placed in the box filled with pure carbon dioxide, longer when carbon dioxide was introduced at a high rate into the box, longer still when oxygen was added to the carbon dioxide gas, and longest when carbon dioxide was streamed slowly into the box.
In the condition with pure carbon dioxide, signs of behavioural agitation and asphyxia were seen.
This was also true for the two conditions in which carbon dioxide streamed into the box, but to a lesser degree.
These signs occurred when some degree of consciousness may still have been present in the animals.
Signs of agitation and asphyxia were almost completely absent in the condition where oxygen was added to the carbon dioxide.
These results not only demonstrate the usefulness of behavioural criteria next to electrophysiological indices, but also demonstrate that the negative effects of carbon dioxide euthanasia can be prevented by an additional supply of oxygen.

NAL Call No.: SF955 E6 Cardiovascular effects of thoracic compression in horses subjected to euthanasia.
Hubbell JAE; Muir WW; Gaynor JS Equine Veterinary Journal v.25(4): p.282-284; 13 ref (1993) Descriptors: anaesthesia; emergencies; heart; bloodflow; euthanasia
Abstract: Six horses scheduled for euthanasia were instrumented for the measurement of blood flow by thermodilution, pulmonary arterial, right atrial and arterial blood pressures and collection of arterial blood for pH and blood gas analysis.
The horses were anaesthetised with intravenous (i.v.) thiamylal sodium (10 mg/kg) and placed in right lateral recumbency.
After euthanasia with an overdose of phenobarbitone sodium (100 mg/kg, i.v.) and loss of the electrocardiogram and arterial pulse pressure, thoracic compression at rates of 40, 60 and 80 compressions/min was instituted.
Thoracic compression was accomplished by an investigator who delivered a blow to the chest wall with his knee dropping from a standing or crouching position.
Compression rates of 40, 60 and 80/min produced blood flows of 5.65 Ã± 0.5, 6.33 Ã± 1.11 and 8.28 Ã± 2.16 litres/min, respectively.
Compression rates of 80/min produced significantly greater blood flows and mean arterial blood pressures than did slower rates.
The blood flows produced by 80 thoracic compressions/min were approximately 50% of those reported for deeply anaesthetised horses and while not sufficient to sustain life might be used to prolong life in order to facilitate distribution of resuscitative drugs to vital tissues.

Bhathena, S. J. Life Sciences v.50(21): p.1649-1655 (1992) Descriptors: glucagon; insulin; liver plasma membrane; plasma receptor; hormone receptor
Abstract: The modes of euthanasia by either anesthesia or by decapitation were compared by assessing several metabolic and hormonal parameters from plasma and hormone receptors from liver plasma membranes.
Two different anesthetics were used.
Compared to decapitation, euthanasia by anesthesia significantly increased plasma glucose and triglyceride levels but not plasma cholesterol.
Plasma insulin was also significantly increased by anesthetics.
No significant differences were observed in plasma glucagon levels or insulin and glucagon receptors from liver plasma membranes between rats euthanized by decapitation and anesthesia.
Glucagon reeptors were however, affected by dietary carbohydrates.
It is concluded that in studies involving measurements of metabolic and hormonal parameters the use of anesthesia is to be avoided for euthanasia and that decapitation should be the method of choice.

Descriptors: rats; euthanasia; carbon-dioxide; animal- welfare; methodology; blood; gases; animal-behavior
Abstract: The two methods (prefilled and fixed flow rate filled chambers) recommended in the 1993 AVMA Euthanasia Panel report for using carbon dioxide to euthanatize rats were evaluated in terms of their effect on behavior and selected blood gas values.
Responses were videotaped during exposure to greater than or equal to 90% carbon dioxide in a prefilled chamber or a gradually filled chamber, using a fixed flow rate of 20% chamber volume/min.
Arterial blood samples were taken to determine partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, pH, and oxygen saturation prior to entering the chamber and at time points determined by rats' responses to carbon dioxide.
Rats showed similar reactions when exposed to carbon dioxide by either method.
Significant differences in mean time for each response to occur were seen between euthanasia methods.
Maintaining a near atmospheric oxygen chamber concentration by using a 75% CO2:20% O2:5% N2 gas mixture to gradually fill the chamber did not change rats' reactions upon exposure.
Significant differences were found between pre-exposure values and values from samples obtained when rats became immobile after entering the prefilled chamber.
Partial pressure of carbon dioxide significantly increased, and pH and percent oxygen saturation significantly decreased from pre-exposure values in all samples obtained after rats entered the gradually filled chamber.
Partial pressure of oxygen in these rats was greater than or equal to pre-exposure levels in all samples.
Rats appeared sedated because of the anesthestic effects of carbon dioxide when immobility was observed.
Distress was not observed in the rats when either method of euthanasia.

Evans AT; Broadstone R; Stapleton J; Hooks TM; Johnston SM; McNeil JR Journal of the American Veterinary Association v.203(5): p.664-666; 15 ref (1993) Descriptors: electrocardiograms; electroencephalograms; pentobarbital; lidocaine
Abstract: Pentobarbital alone, pentobarbital plus 1% lidocaine solution, pentobarbital plus 2% lidocaine solution, and pentobarbital plus 3% lidocaine solution were each used to kill 6 dogs.
For each dog, time between the beginning of injection of the euthanasia solution and each of the following events was recorded: collapse, onset of apnoea, flat-line electrocardiogram, flat-time electroencephalogram, loss of palpable heartbeat, and loss of palpable pulse.
Any signs of pain or discomfort were also recorded.
There were no significant differences among groups except for time to flat-line electrocardiogram.
Dogs killed with pentobarbital alone had significantly longer times than did dogs killed with pentobarbital in combination with any of the lidocaine concentrations.
It was concluded that pentobarbital in combination with lidocaine was a reasonable alternative to pentobarbital alone when killing dogs.

Arluke A Journal of the American Veterinary Association v.198(7): p.1176-1180; 6 ref (1991) Descriptors: pets; population density
Abstract: An ethnographic study was made of a single 'kill shelter' serving a major metropolitan area [in the USA].
76 h were spent observing all the facets of shelter work and life, including euthanasia of animals and training shelter workers how to do it.
Results showed that workers had to be able to get used to the value of euthanasia, the technical aspects, as a humane act to reduce suffering, to be able to shift the blame on to the people abandoning the pets and themselves as having to combat pet overpopulation.
The 'shelter culture' served to admit workers into an inner community once they performed euthanasia so that they could support each other, and also this community considered that attachment to particular animals was normal.
Therefore the shelter culture adapted the euthanasia routine to accommodate concerns of the workers.

Abstract: Embutramide is a general anesthetic having a strong narcotic effect on the central nervous system where it paralyzes the brain center that controls respiration.
It is a constituent of T61, a veterinary euthanasia drug.
This paper describes a gas chromatographic procedure using nitrogen- phosphorus detection for the determination of embutramide in biological matrices.
The drug and the internal standard (ambucetamide) are extracted with dichloromethane under alkaline conditions.
The method is linear from 100 to 3000 ng/ml.
The within-day and day-to-day coefficients of variation range from 5.1 to 5.7% and from 9.1 to 10.0%, respectively.
The recovery is above 80% while the minimum detectable level under the conditions described is 40 ng/ml analyzing a 1-ml or a 1-g aliquot of a sample (blood or tissue).
The method is also applied to different samples from dogs euthanized with T61.

NAL Call No.: 41.8 Am3 Disseminated opportunistic fungal disease in dogs: 10 cases (1982-1990).
Watt, P. R.; Robins, G. M.; Galloway, A. M.; O'Boyle, D. A. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association v.207(1): p.67-70 (1995) Descriptors: antifungal drugs; neck pain; back pain; weight loss; anorexia; pyrexia; paresis; paralysis; diskospondylitis; euthanasia
Abstract: Medical records of 10 dogs in which fungal infection was diagnosed between 1982 and 1990 were reviewed.
In each dog, infection was determined to be caused by a single species of fungus, either Aspergillus terreus, Penicillium sp, Paecilomyces sp, Chrysosporium sp, or Pseudallescheria boydii.
Nine dogs were German Shepherd Dogs; 1 was a German Shepherd Dog cross, and 9 were females.
The most common clinical signs were signs of neck or back pain (9 dogs), weight loss (7 dogs), anorexia (6 dogs), pyrexia (6 dogs), paresis (3 dogs), and paralysis (3 dogs).
All 10 dogs had evidence of multiple sites of diskospondylitis.
Urine sediment was examined in 6 dogs, and all 6 had fungal hyphae.
Urine samples from these dogs produced a medium to heavy pure growth of fungi when placed on Sabaraud's medium.
Predisposing causes were not identified in any of the dogs.
Four dogs were euthanatized immediately after diagnosis because of paralysis or paresis.
The other 6 dogs were treated, and 4 of the 6 received itraconazole.
One dog was euthanatized for an unrelated problem after 21 months of treatment; 1 dog was still alive after 4 years of continuous treatment with itraconazole.
The other 4 dogs were euthanatized because of eventual paralysis or paresis.
Our results suggest that German Shepherd bogs are predisposed to infection with opportunistic fungi, possibly because of a specific inability to mount an effective response.
This predisposition needs to be further studied.

NAL Call No.: SH171 J68 Effect of different methods of killing Atlantic salmon on whole-body concentrations of selected electrolytes.
Perry CM Journal of Aquatic Animal Health v.2(2): p.154- 156; 8 ref (1990) Descriptors: calcium; sodium; potassium; magnesium; injectable anasthesia; euthanasia
Abstract: Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), mean total length, 44 mm, were killed by an overdose of tricaine (MS-22) or quinaldine sulfate, or by a blow to the head.
Comparisons of whole-body concentrations of Na+, K+, Mg2+ were made among fish killed by the different methods.
The Na concentration in fish killed with quinaldine sulfate was significantly lower than that in fish killed by the other methods.
There were no significant differences in the concentrations of the other cations among treatments.

Descriptors: rabbits; rats; euthanasia; fat metabolism; aorta; colon
Abstract: This study was designed to determine the effects that specific euthanasia methods have on vascular arachidonic acid metabolism and vascular and intestinal smooth muscle contractility.
Rats were euthanatized by decapitation (DC), pentobarbital overdose (PB), or anesthesia with CO2, methoxyflurane or ether followed by DC (CO2-DC, Met-DC, Ether-DC, respectively).
Rabbits were killed by a similar protocol, but CO2 overexposure replaced Ether-DC.
The rat and rabbit aortas produced mainly 6-keto PGF1 alpha, the prostacyclin metabolite, and lesser amounts of PGE2.
No qualitative differences were seen in arachidonate metabolites.
However, aortic tissue from rabbits and rats killed by Met-DC produced more prostacyclin.
In contrast, aorta from rabbits euthanatized by CO2-DC produced less prostacyclin than controls, whereas aorta from rats killed in the same way yielded greater amounts of prostacyclin.
Aortic tissue from rabbits killed by Met-DC and CO2-OD was less responsive to acetylcholine (ACH).
Intestinal contractility to ACH was increased in rabbits when Met-DC was used as the method of euthanasia, while colon from rats sacrificed by Met-DC showed decreased responsiveness to ACH.
Colon from rats killed by intraperitoneal PB exhibited altered contractility to ACH and norepinephrine.
The results of this study show that methoxyflurane, carbon dioxide (rabbit) and pentobarbital (rat) alter the vascular synthesis of prostacyclin and smooth muscle contractility.
We conclude that the method of euthanasia affects certain physiologic parameters and careful consideration should be given to the selection of a particular euthanasia technique.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects that specific euthanasia methods have on mitogen induced lymphocyte proliferation (LP) and the induction of alloantigen specific cytolytic T-lymphocytes (CTL).
Mice were euthanatized by cervical dislocation (CD), or anesthesia with methoxyflurane or pentobarbital followed by CD (M-CD or P-CD respectively), CO2 overexposure (CO2-OD) or halothane overexposure (H-OD).
Mitogenic lymphoproliferation was increased in cells derived from mice euthanatized by M-CD and P-CD.
In contrast, the cytolytic profile of CTL derived from mice euthanatized by P-CD, CO2-OD and H-OD was decreased.
The results of this study show that euthanasia techniques involving the use of methoxyflurane, pentobarbital, CO2 and halothane affect in vitro lymphoproliferation and CTL function.
We conclude that the method of euthanasia influences certain immunologic parameters and selection of a particular technique should be given careful consideration.

(1994 Aug.) Descriptors: rats; acetylcholinesterase; choline- acetyltransferase; enzyme activity; anesthesia; carbon dioxide; decapitation; hippocampus; cerebral cortex; cerebellum; euthanasia; animal-welfare
Abstract: We report that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities in rat brain were virtually identical whether the rat was anesthetized with carbon dioxide (CO2) before decapitation or decapitated without prior sedation.
The AChE and ChAT activities were measured in three brain regions; the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum.
Enzyme activities varied significantly by brain region, with the highest values in the hippocampus and the lowest values in the cerebellum.
Enzyme activities, however, did not vary with the method of euthanasia, either CO2-induced anesthesia prior to decapitation or decapitation without anesthesia.
These data suggest that CO2-induced anesthesia prior to decapitation does not alter activities of these cholinergic markers in rat hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum.
This method of euthanasia eliminates the need to capture a conscious animal, which reduces stress to the animal and the experimenter.

Abstract: We report that the short-term use of various anesthetic agents prior to decapitation causes alteration of the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in kidney, brain, heart, muscle, and liver.
These data indicate that even light anesthesia can not be used when levels of this metabolite are to be determined.
Also, it appears that the use of any of these anesthetics can profoundly alter glucose utilization in many tissues.

Abstract: The implications of shooting animals in the area of the occipito-atlantal junction was evaluated in 3 sheep by recording changes in the EEG activity.
All 3 animals were shot with a 5.6 mm calibre rifle using solid lead bullets with an estimated muzzle velocity of 950 m/s.
In the first sheep, due to incorrect aiming of the rifle, the bullet passed below the cervical vertebra.
In the second sheep, a shot which entered the occipito-atlantal junction and fractured the first cervical vertebra failed to produce insensibility.
In contrast, a shot in the third sheep which struck the occipital condyles of the skull resulted in loss of cortical evoked responses, the presence of high amplitude low frequency activity and ultimately all loss of brain activity.
It is concluded that shooting through the vertebral column does not necessarily transmit sufficient percussive forces to higher brain regions to produce immediate insensibility.
It is suggested that this has important implications for the humane destruction of animals, particularly, as in the cases of cetaceans, where the occipito-atlantal junction or a high neck position is a recommended target area.

Descriptors: mice; ethanol; cross reaction
Abstract: Mice were immunised with an immunogenic peptide construct CKNNNSTNSGI coupled to diphtheria toxoid as a carrier.
This peptide sequence contains the epitope STNS which is the target of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies directed against the second merozoite surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum.
Antisera raised against the peptide construct were taken using an injection of 70 per cent ethanol or sodium pentobarbitone as methods of euthanasia and these methods compared by determining their effects on the binding specificity of the antibody to the antigen using the immunological criteria of immunofluoresence, immunoblotting and ELISA assays.
There was no significant decrease in antibody binding with either sodium pentobarbitone, or ethanol with a final concentration of less than 30 per cent in mouse antisera.
Antisera with an added ethanol concentration of 40 to 60 per cent relaxed antibody conformation and this raises the possibility of using the differential effects of ethanol as a tool in mapping antigenic fine structure of a range of antibodies directed against defined epitopes.
The cross-reactive response of non-specific antibodies in polyclonal antisera was lowered at the suggested dosage for ethanol euthanasia.
Ethanol has immense potential as an alternative method of euthanasia when barbiturate drugs, such as sodium pentobarbitone, are unavailable in specific experimental protocols.
This may especially aid research workers in developing countries involved in vaccine development, antibody production and subsequent serological analysis.

NAL Call No.: 41.8 D482 Ethical and legal questions of the killing of animals to prevention to considerable pain and suffering.
Moebius, G. DTW (Deutsche Tieraerztliche Wochenschrift) v.101(9): p.372-376 (1994) Descriptors: ethics; cruelty; euthanasia
Abstract: The ethical and legal problems that are connected with the killing of animals are continuously discussed.
Problems with the interpretation of "reasonable reason" and the public criticism of killing to get luxury goods as well as of the methods of killing show the main points.
ln contrast to the killing of animals in the interest of people the euthanasia of animals to prevention of considerable, not to soothed pain and suffering is appreciated generally as reasonably and ethically justified.
The ethical justification confronts with legal problems based on the conflicting position of animals in civil law.
These problems are important for a practising veterinarian.

Endenburg, N.; Vorstenbosch, J. M. G. Veterinary Quarterly v.14(4): p.129-136 (1992) Descriptors: dog; cat; euthanasia; tail docking; ear clipping; sterilization; behavior
Abstract: This article deals with ethical aspects of companion animal ownership.
Research was done by means of interviews (n = 40) and questionnaires (n = 871).
Respondents were randomly chosen from Dutch telephone directories.
Euthanasia, docking tails, ear clipping and sterilisation are discussed on the basis of the opinions of respondents.
Owners of companion animals very often seem to have insufficient knowledge about animal behaviour.
Companion animal owners as a group differ rather strongly in their moral opinions about the acceptability of certain actions towards animals.
At the individual level also people are not always consequent in their reasoning as was illustrated by their opinions about ear clipping and the stopping of tail docking and vice versa.
Respondents live in a community with animals and usually use a utilitarian balancing model.
The different outcomes of the uses of this balancing model indicate how far the respondents are willing to adapt their life style to the needs of an animal; in other words to what extent intrinsic values and integrity are taken into account within the process of (re)creating a living community.

Abstract: An 8-year-old, neutered, male, domestic shorthaired cat is admitted to your clinic with a complaint of lethargy and anorexia.
The cat was last examined 2 months previously with a urinary tract infection and severe cellulitis at the site of a ventral abdominal urethrostomy.
The urethrostomy was performed several years ago at another clinic.
Euthanasia was recommended during your first examination, but the owner insisted on treatment.
The cat improved after receiving fluids and systemic and topical antibiotics, but its condition suddenly deteriorated 2 days ago.
Physical examination reveals severe dehydration, bradycardia, hypothermia, and an infected and fly- blown urethrostomy opening.
Euthanasia is again recommended.
The owner refuses and leaves the clinic, apparently intending to seek a second opinion.

Euthanasia by decapitation: evidence that this technique produces prompt, painless unconsciousness in laboratory rodents.
Holson, R. R. Neurotoxicology and Teratology v.14(4): p.253-7 (1992 July-1992 Aug.) Descriptors: rodents; animal welfare; method
Abstract: Rapid euthanasia of laboratory rodents without the use of anesthesia is a necessary research technique whenever there is the likelihood of anesthesia or stress interfering with the chemistry of the tissues under investigation.
Decapitation has long been the procedure of choice under such circumstances.
Recently, however, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) panel on euthanasia recommended that decapitation be avoided on the grounds that the decapitated head may be conscious and suffering for as much as 15 seconds.
The panel further recommended that if decapitation was scientifically necessary, the decapitated head be immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen.
These AVMA guidelines now enjoy regulatory status; the recommendation that decapitation be avoided has thus caused considerable difficulty for all research requiring rapid, anesthesia-free collection of tissues.
The scientific validity of these recommendations is consequently a matter of great practical as well as theoretical importance.
The decision to discourage decapitation appears to have been based on a single literature report claiming that the EEG of the decapitated head revealed conscious suffering for more than 10 seconds (Mikeska and Klemm 1976).
This review carefully examines the scientific literature on this subject.
It is concluded that the report by Mikeska and Klemm of EEG activation in the decapitated head is correct, but that this phenomenon is also seen when the decapitated head is under deep anesthesia, and in normal brains under ether anesthesia or during REM sleep.
Hence these findings do not demonstrate either consciousness or the perception of pain.

Abstract: The efficacy for the euthanasia of day-old chicks of mixtures of carbon dioxide and air, or carbon dioxide and argon containing 1, 2 or 5% residual oxygen, or argon containing 1 or 2% residual oxygen was tested in 3 experiments.
The time to the onset of unconsciousness of individual chicks, determined from the time to loss of posture, was similar during their exposure to 2% oxygen in argon, 20, 30 or 40% carbon dioxide in argon with 2% residual oxygen, or 90% carbon dioxide in air.
The exposure of chicks in batches of 20 to a mixture of 20, 30 or 40% carbon dioxide in argon resulted in the death of all the chicks within 2 minutes.
However, a residual oxygen level of 5% in these mixtures resulted in the survival of some chicks for longer than 2 minutes.
With argon alone the level of residual oxygen was critical; less than 2% was essential to achieve 100% mortality within 3 minutes, and a rise from 2 to about 3% resulted in up to 20% of the chicks surviving for 7 minutes.

Ayala, G. F.; Padilla, S. G.; Uribe, V. E.; De, A. A. S. Veterinaria Mexico v.25(1): p.51-54 (1994) Descriptors: electrocution; dogs
Abstract: Effectiveness of an electrical method to euthanize clogs was clinically and electrophysiologically assessed.
A 126 V, 3 A electrical current was delivered through a pair of stainless steel nippers placed dorsally on the skin of the animals.
Death was almost immediate after applying the electrical current during a period of 20 seconds.
However, this method was only effective when one of the nippers was placed on the skin covering the occipital protuberance and the other one near the insertion of the tail.
It is also important that the skin-nipper contact areas are completely wet with an electrolytic solution (faucet water), in order to facilitate the current flow.
Since animals exhibited a minimum of suffering, it is concluded that the method described in this paper is appropriated to euthanize adult dogs.

Descriptors: nitrogen; consciousness; behavior
Abstract: The time periods and the behavioural pattern of mink euthanized with carbon dioxide (CO2), 100% and 70%, carbon monoxide (CO), 4%, and nitrogen (N2), 100%, are described.
The time between the placement of the animal in a glass box and the first symptoms of incoordination (phase I), the period to loss of consciousness (phase II), and, finally, the coma phase until cessation of respiration (phase III) using three groups each of 10 pastel male mink each were recorded.
Phase I times ranged from 14 s for CO2, 31 s for N2, and 49 s for CO.
In phase II, the difference was even more pronounced, being 5 s for CO2, 15 s for CO, and 45 s for N2.
In phase III, the time was 58 s for N2, 134 s and 151 s for CO2 and CO respectively.
Hence, the critical period from the time when the animals were placed in the glass box till unconsciousness occurred (phase I and II) was 19 s for CO2, 64 s for CO, and 76 s for N2.
The total course of euthanasia was 153 s for CO2, 215 s for CO, and 134 s for N2.
The following minimum times will be required before it can be judged to be safe to remove the animals: CO2 and N2: 5 min, and for CO: 6.5 min.
In a supplementary experiment, involving a mixture of 70% CO2 and 30% atmospheric air, it was not possible within the allotted time to kill adult male mink.
Convulsions, in phase III only, occurred to a varying degree in all the animals euthanized with CO, and N2, and in 6 out of the 10 animals killed with CO.

Abstract: Preliminary studies in 19 cats indicated that there was little perception of either injection of sodium pentobarbital-lidocaine when cats were minimally restrained and the agent was injected rapidly.
When the injection penetrated the liver, rapid achievement of recumbency resulted.
Intrahepatic injection was performed in 85 cats and intraperitoneal injection was performed in 77 cats.
Response to injection, excitement, and speed of euthanasia were observed, then cats were examined PM to determine exact location of euthanasia agent.
Although i.v. injection is the method of choice for euthanasia in veterinary practice it is suggested that when non-veterinarians have to kill stray cats in large numbers, intrahepatic injection is a humane method.

Abstract: In anticipation of the need to kill large numbers of cattle in the event of a foreign animal disease outbreak, 2 models of captive bolt gun and various firearms and ammunition loads were tested in order to assess their suitability.
In the first phase of the project, 2 models of captive bolt stunner were used in an abattoir, and assessed for effectiveness.
In the second phase, several firearms and ammunition were used on isolated bovine heads and assessed for effectiveness.
Little difference was found between the 2 captive bolt stunners.
Of the firearms and ammunition evaluated, the Ruger Mini-14 and the Core-Shot round, a prefragmented projectile, were large herds of livestock are to depopulated, and where the restraint required for the use of captive bolt stunners is not practical, there are commercially available firearms and ammunition that are suitable for this purpose.

Abstract: 2 interviews with 89 cat owners, one soon after diagnosis of cancer in the cat and one 6 months later, were used to identify factors associated with the owners satisfaction with euthanasia or intervention, and to evaluate expectations of the owners who selected an intervention.
Satisfaction with euthanasia was associated with the ability of the cat to groom itself, eat, and play at the first interview.
Among owners who selected an intervention, factors associated with being satisfied were: clinic of origin, having a live cat at the 6-month follow- up interview, understanding of the number of return visits required for the intervention, and type and frequency of adverse effects.
30% (21 of 69) of the owners tended to overestimate their cats' life expectancy.
Owners also felt they had reasonably accurate estimations of adverse effects of treatment and number of return visits, but underestimated the costs required for an intervention.

Abstract: The rodent protection test (RPT) is used in antimicrobial research to confirm the in vivo efficacy of novel antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agents.
The RPT may involve lethal infection and thus has the potential to cause significant suffering.
These Guidelines recommend refinements to the RPT which reduce animal use to a minimum and suggest cardinal clinical signs which act as predictors of lethality.
Early recognition of these signs is imperative to minimize suffering, allow identification of humane end points and permit timely euthanasia.
Constructive suggestions for the improvement of these Guidelines are welcomed.

Abstract: 102 horses requiring to be euthanased for a variety of reasons were killed by the intravenous injection of a mixture of quinalbarbitone sodium (400 mg/ml) and cinchocaine hydrochloride (25 mg/ml).
The dose rates used were 1 ml/10, 15, 20 and 30 kg bodyweight, and the time of injection was varied between 5 and 25 seconds.
The average time to collapse from the start of injection was 34 seconds and the average time to clinical death was 230 seconds.
Slow injection (particularly of the low dose rates) and premedication with detomidine resulted in a longer time to collapse (median 46 seconds).
Premedication with xylazine and low dose rates of the mixture resulted in an unacceptable degree of muscular activity and agonal gasping and death was delayed.
Premedication with romifidine and butorphanol resulted in an apparent (but insignificant) reduction in the time to collapse and death was also accompanied by significant agonal gasping.
Without premedication quinalbarbitone and cinchocaine resulted in a smooth and quiet collapse with the cessation of cardiac and respiratory functions within 3 minutes in all cases, but the palpebral reflex of the horses was prolonged significantly beyond the time when all other reflex activity was lost.
Occasional gasping and muscular tremors, particularly of the upper forelimb, occurred particularly when lower dose rates were used.
One horse which was premedicated with xylazine and received a very low dose at a slow rate showed unacceptable violent muscular activity.
At no other time was the procedure regarded as violent or unacceptable.
Inadvertent extravascular injection caused no apparent pain.
A dose rate of 25 ml for ponies and 50 ml for horses is recommended, and the injection should be administered intravenously over 10 to 15 seconds.
The carcase of a horse killed in this way is not fit for human consumption.

Abstract: A cost-effective and humane method for on- farm killing of old hens is described.
A mobile modified atmosphere killing (MAK) unit was developed, consisting of a 21 ft.3 [6.4 m3] closed cart with spring-loaded doors through which hens can be placed inside.
A carbon dioxide (CO2) cylinder is mounted on the unit so that CO2 can be dispensed into the interior, as needed, to maintain the concentration of CO2 above 30%, in order to stun and kill birds rapidly.
The MAK unit is rolled along the isles of hen houses, so hens can be put into it directly from their cages, thus minimising handling stress.
Hens become unconscious within 20 s and die within 2 min.
The MAK unit has clear loading doors so that the operator can ensure birds are dying rapidly and thus can dispense CO2 accordingly and ensure that live hens are not overlain by other hens.
The prototype MAK proved to be effective in on-farm trials and it is suggested that the efficiency of the unit should make it possible to recover the cost of the CO2 used to kill the hens.

Abstract: This study was carried out under commercial conditions to investigate the feasibility of killing turkeys while they were still in their transport containers, with a mixture of gases, and to compare the effects of this method and electrical stunning on the prevalence of carcass downgrading conditions and hemorrhages in the breast muscles.
The results showed that turkeys could be readily killed while still in their transport containers by using either anoxia induced with 90 per cent argon in air or hypercapnic anoxia induced with a mixture of 30 per cent carbon dioxide and 60 per cent argon in air, and that the prevalence of carcass-downgrading conditions and hemorrhages in the breast muscles was lower after killing the turkeys with the gases.

Animal welfare considerations in killing by euthanasia, slaughter and hunting in Europe.
Oen, E. O. Norsk Veterinaertidsskrift v.108(5): p.313- 321 (1996) Descriptors: literature review; animal welfare; techniques; slaughter;
Abstract: Some people compare the killing of an animal by euthanasia and slaughter with hunting.
The methods are so different that any real comparison is impossible.
This kind of comparison is none the less widespread.
From an animal welfare point of view the most important objective is to render the animal unconscious as rapidly as possible.
The way in which the animal ultimately is killed, in principle, is irrelevant when unconsciousness has occurred.
In slaughtering of livestock in abattoirs, the killing methods does not give exclusive priority to animal welfare considerations.
A number of other considerations such as economy, market acceptance of the product, worker's safety, and work environment, seem to count just as much as animal welfare.
Despite good intentions and regulations, killing methods for domestic animals are by no means devoid of faults and misuse.
Both methodological and technological weaknesses have been identified.
There is no room for individual considerations.
and the technology has been adapted to meet the requirement of a high-tempo slaughtering process which must not be slowed down by the killing process, inwhich the quality of the product must not be impaired.
Even so, from the point of view of animal welfare, the centralized and industrialized process, which imposes suffering through a long and stressful process which can last for up to several days before the animals are put to death, is the aspect worthy of the gravest concern.
Wild free-roaming animals are shot in their natural environment and most of them have not been subjected to man-made stress before being shot at.
However, animals wounded during the hunt is a serious problem associated with hunting.
In most cases it is the result of human error, but also for hunting, economical considerations like prices and size of quotas will have impact on the humaneness of the activity.
If we focus exclusively on the moment the animal is killed, i.e. when the bolt or the electric shock hits the animal, the risk of a long survival time will be greater for hunted than slaughtered animals.
On the other hand, most hunted animals will be killed without realizing that they are being hunted, and they will not be subjected to the long-term stress and pain experienced by animals for slaughter before they are killed.
So, from an animal point of view, it is not obvious that the killing of livestock is more acceptable than hunting.

Abstract: To determine if anesthetic agents used in laboratory animal euthanasia affected sperm motion parameters, rats (n = 10 per group) were euthanized by one of 5 different methods: decapitation alone, or decapitation following either ether, halothane, or Nembutal anesthesia, or CO2 asphyxiation.
Sperm were collected from the distal cauda epididymis, diluted, and videotaped for computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA; HTM-2030, Hamilton-Thorn Research, Beverly, MA).
The percentage of motile sperm (MOT), their straight-line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), curvilinear velocity (VCL), linear index (LINX), and linearity (LIN) were measured on 
No significant differences in any of these 6 motion parameters were found among the treatment groups.
Thus, none of these 5 methods of euthanasia affect sperm motion as assessed by CASA methods, making them equally suitable for use in reproductive toxicology studies.

This imaging procedure enabled precise localization of the projectile and metal and bony fragments, and depicted parenchymal damage, distortion and displacement of the brain, and skull fractures.
Computerized tomography scanning was found to be useful in the clinical evaluation of craniocerebral missile injuries and confirmed the acceptability of the 0.22 calibre rifle and 12-gauge shotgun for the euthanasia of sheep.

Abstract: Intramuscular administration of veterinary drugs can induce severe muscle damage resulting in economic losses and residue persistence.
Local tolerance is usually evaluated by macroscopic examination of the injection site requiring euthanasia of a large number of animals.
A noninvasive quantitative method, based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of creatine kinase (CK) release from muscle, is proposed for the evaluation of post-injection muscle damage.
Plasma CK activity is a specific and sensitive marker of skeletal muscle damage.
Three disposition parameters are needed to measure the actual amount of CK released by the injured

Descriptors: dogs; rabbits; euthanasia
Abstract: A number of experiments was carried out to determine the sequence of events leading to death following administration of the euthanizing agent T61.
Simultaneous recordings of the EMG, EEG, ECG and end-tidal CO2 (dogs only) were obtained in acutely instrumented rabbits and dogs.
Results show that following T61 administration the loss of consciousness and loss of muscle activity occurred simultaneously.
Vocalization and increased muscle movement occurred in the initial phase of the injection in 3 of 8 dogs, injected with T61 or butyramid.
From this study it was concluded that the presence of the muscle relaxant does not pose an ethical problem for the use of T61 as an euthanizing agent, but our results suggest that the use of T61 may have some emotionally unpleasant side-effects.

NAL Call No.: SH365 A1J6 Options for humanely immobilizing and killing crabs.

Journal of Shellfish Research v.16(1): p.219-224 (1997) Descriptors: Pseudocarcinus gigas; australian giant crab; freshwater bath; chilling; heating; prolonged air exposure; hypercapnic seawater bath; 2-phenoxy ethanol bath; magnesium sulfate bath; benzocaine bath; MS 222 bath; chloroform bath; clove oil bath; aqui-s bath; xylazine hydrochloride injection; ketamine-hydrochloride injection
Abstract: Trials were conducted on the Australian giant crab Pseudocarcinus gigas (Lamarck) to evaluate methods to: paralyze by injection (so that no muscular response is observed); paralyze by bath; humanely kill for scientific purposes; and humanely kill for human consumption.
Treatments tested were: freshwater bath, chilling, heating, prolonged exposure to air, hypercapnic seawater bath (carbon dioxide addition), 2-phenoxy ethanol bath, magnesium sulfate bath, benzocaine bath, MS 222 bath, chloroform bath, clove oil bath, AQUI-S bath, xylazine-HCl by injection, and ketamine-HCl by injection.
Xylazine-HCl (16 or 22 mg/kg) and ketamine-HCl (0.025-0.1 mg/kg), administered by injection, appear to be the best techniques for paralyzing crabs for short periods.
Where injection is impractical, crabs may be successfully paralyzed within 30 min by a bath treatment of clove oil ( gtoreq 0.125 mL/L) or AQUI-S ( gtoreq 0.5mL/L).
Chloroform (1.25 mL/L; 1.5 h) and clove oil (-O. 125 mL/L; ltoreq 60 min) baths appeared to kill crabs humanely and are useful options for scientific use; however, clove oil is preferred because chloroform poses a human health risk.
Of the methods tested, only clove oil and AQUI-S appear promising as treatments for the humane killing of crabs for human consumption.

Patronek GJ; Glickman LT; Moyer MR Anthrozoos v.8(1): p.31-43; 20 ref (1995) Descriptors: animal welfare; age; breeds; risk factors
Abstract: The records of dogs in an animal shelter in Chester County, Pennsylvania were analyzed for a 3.5-year period to describe the canine population dynamics and to identify the risk factors for dogs' failure to be reclaimed or to be euthanized.
Dogs over 1 year of age accounted for the majority (72.5%) of incoming dogs.
41% of dogs received by the shelter were purebred.
The 6 most common breeds were Labrador Retriever (14.6%), German Shepherd (9.8%), Golden Retriever (7.5%), Beagle (7.1%), Cocker Spaniel (5.5%), and Siberian Husky (5.3%), accounting for 50% of all incoming purebred dogs.
Nearly one fifth (17.2%) of the live surrendered dogs were brought in by their owners specifically to be euthanized.
A similar proportion (18.8%) of adopted dogs were returned to the shelter.
52% of surrendered dogs and 77% of stray dogs were discharged alive from the shelter (53.8% of stray dogs were returned to their owners).
The reclaim rate was lowest (10.8%) for the dogs 
67.7% of purebred dogs were reclaimed by their owners, compared with 41.2% of mixed breed dogs.
More purebred dogs were reclaimed the same day they were admitted than mixed breed dogs (46.1% vs. 38.0%).
Approximately 60% of all stray dogs Ã² 1 year old were reclaimed each month while only 23.2% of dogs less than 1 year were reclaimed.
Mixed breed dogs were 1.8 times more as likely to be euthanized as purebred dogs.
The risk of euthanasia increased with age for mixed breed dogs, but not for purebred dogs.
Purebred dogs Ã² 3 years old were at an increased risk of euthanasia only when compared with dogs 
Of the dogs that were adopted, purebred dogs 
Approximately one fifth (19.4%) of purebred dogs were adopted through a breed rescue group.

Abstract: Progressive ethmoidal haematoma was diagnosed in 12 Thoroughbreds, 1 part-Arab and 1 stock horse.
Ages ranged from 3 to 18 years and both males and females were affected.
Diagnosis was based on history, clinical signs, endoscopic and radiographic findings, and was confirmed histologically in 10 cases.
Eleven (78%) of the lesions were unilateral and 3 (22%) were bilateral.
Two horses were euthanased on diagnosis, 4 were treated conservatively.
Of the latter, 3 were euthanased 6 to 24 months after diagnosis; due to progression of the lesions, while 1 case resolved completely within 13 months.
Eight horses were treated by surgical excision of the lesion.
Three died in the post-operative period, 3 were euthanased within 48 months after recurrence of the condition, and 2 had no recurrence within 60 and 72 months, respectively.

Abstract: Albino rabbits (2-2.3 kg) were euthanized with T-61R (N-[2-(m-methoxyphenyl)-2-ethylbutyl-(1)-]-gamma- hydroxybutyram ide, 200 mg/mL; 4,4'-methylene-bis- (cyclohexyltrimethylammonium iodide), 50 mg/mL; tetracaine hydrochloride, 5 mg/mL; 0.2-1.0 mL/kg, i.v.) or EuthanylR (pentobarbital sodium, 100-240 mg/kg, i.v.) at 15:00 h, and samples of arteriovenous blood or venous blood were collected.
The time to loss of consciousness was dose dependent for T-61, ranging from 7 to 1 s or less.
Serum obtained after T-61 euthanasia, but not after Euthanyl, was routinely contaminated with measurable hemoglobin levels (up to an estimated 3 mg/mL).
The extent of hemolysis increased with increasing T-61 doses.
The activity of hexosaminidase in the serum (determined by hydrolysis of a methylumbelliferyl substrate at pH 4.6) was up to 80% lower in sera obtained after the use of T-61 compared with sera obtained after the use of Euthanyl or without euthanasia drugs.
The reduction in measurable activity appears to be due to interference, by hemoglobin, in the fluorescence measurements of the methylumbelliferol reaction product (with threshold effects being detected at 0.1 mg/mL).
Standardization of serum volumes used in these types of enzyme assays and reporting on hemoglobin levels is thus recommended.

Abstract: The influence of time between euthanasia and lung fixation on the fixed to physiological lung volume ratio was investigated in 13 normal sheep lungs.
Physiological lung volumes were measured in anaesthetized sheep by a single-breath helium dilution method.
Sheep were immediately euthanased and the lungs removed and fixed by constant-pressure airway instillation of 4% paraformaldehyde for a period of 4 days.
The time delay prior to fixation varied from 20 to 380 min.
The fixed lung volume was measured by water displacement.
The fixed to physiological lung volume ratio was significantly positively correlated with the time delay (r-s = 0.831; P lt 0.001).
Post-mortem bronchoconstriction may account for this phenomenon.

Abstract: Establishing a prognosis for dogs with dominance-related aggression is difficult.
Some dominant- aggressive dogs respond well to treatment but others continue to be a serious risk for their owners.
A study was performed to identify characteristics of dominance-related aggression and to identify risk factors associated with whether the aggressive behaviour led to euthanasia.
Medical records of 110 dogs with dominance-related aggression were examined retrospectively; characteristics of owner-directed aggression and eventual outcome of the dogs were recorded.
By means of logistic regression, 2 different models were found to describe the association between behaviour characteristics and outcome.
In the first model, severe aggression in response to benign dominance challenges and body weight 
In the second model, unpredictability of aggression and a history of being purchased were associated with outcome.
It is concluded that dominance-related aggressive behaviour can be subclassified according to severity and type and that outcome (ie, euthanasia) may be predictable in some cases.

Abstract: In the past veterinary interest in snails has been confined to their role in the transmission of disease; nowadays the trend to keep these animals in captivity - for food, for study, as 'companion animals' - means that the profession is increasingly likely to be consulted about their health, welfare or conservation.
An understanding of the biology of snails is an important prerequisite to work with them.
Land snails are hermaphrodite and have a complex reproductive system; other organs also show special adaptations.
Management methods vary considerably and farmed snails can be maintained under extensive or intensive conditions.
Methods for handling and transporting them are important considerations.
There is little published information on the diseases and pathology of snails but suboptimum environment, poisons, nutritional deficiencies, predators and parasites are known to cause or contribute, to their mortality.

All health problems reported by owners and veterinarians in the first 2 weeks of ownership were tabulated.
The prevalence of serious disease among pups (resulting in death, euthanasia, return, or extensive treatment) was 
Pups from pet stores had more respiratory tract disease, but fewer fleas and parasites of the intestinal tract.
Data supplied by the veterinarians indicated that the risk of intestinal tract diseases was significantly higher among pups from pet stores and SPCA pounds compared with those from private owners.
The prevalence of reported behavioural and congenital problems did not differ among the 4 sources.

A study of different euthanasia techniques in guinea pigs, rats and mice.
Animal response and postmortem findings.

Abstract: Different killing techniques for guineapigs, rats and mice were compared using 24 animals for each species.
Stunning by a blow to the back of the neck (guineapigs), decapitation with guillotine (rats) and cervical dislocation (mice) were judged to be followed by immediate unconsciousness rapidly followed by a cessation of breathing.
If possible, animals should be sedated or lightly anaesthetized before death using a physical method.
Physical methods induced local traumatic damage (neck, brain, meninges) as well as changes in the respiratory organs, especially the lungs (emphysema, bleeding, blood and fodder aspiration).
Intraperitoneal overdose of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg body weight) was followed by a calm induction within 2-3 min and a cessation of breathing within 8-11 min with considerable individual variation.
Morphologically, acute degenerative lesions in myocardial muscle cells and circulatory changes in the kidney cortex as well as limited lung changes were demonstrated in all species.
Pure CO2 in an equilibrated system induced unconsciousness within 10-20 seconds in rats and mice and within 40 seconds in guineapigs, followed by rapid death.
Rats especially showed a moderate uneasiness during the induction.
All species developed lung emphysema while myocardial cell changes and extravasation to alveoli were found in guineapigs and rats.
Induction with CO2/O2 (80:20) for 1 min followed by pure CO2 was judged to be the most humane method.
By adding O2 the time for induction of unconsciousness was doubled in rats and mice but not much changed in guineapigs.
Breathing ceased within 4 min in rats and mice and within 7 min in guineapigs.
In all species this method induced lung oedema and considerable extravasation to alveoli and thus was not recommended for studies including morphological investigations of lungs.
From a strict animal welfare point of view the CO2/O2- method is the most recommendable of the methods studied, followed by the pure CO2-method and next pentobarbital i/p.

Cohen, S. P.; Sawyer, D. C. Problems in Veterinary Medicine v.3(1): p.101-9 (1991 Mar.)
Descriptors: bonding; human-pet; cat diseases; psychology; dog diseases; psychology; veterinary; pain
Abstract: Suffering is a powerful but elusive concept in veterinary medicine.
Because the companion animal cannot talk, assessment of suffering requires the best judgment of veterinarian, family, and other interested participants.
Determining whether euthanasia is appropriate rests on a similar consensus but is based on the entire medical and social situation.
Clinicians need skill, sensitivity, and a well- developed sense of timing to uncover what clients really feel and want.
Offering the family options, such as to be present during the euthanasia, makes the veterinarian's task easier and helps clients cope.

Abstract: A nineteen month old male Hovawart dog was referred to the clinic with a history of apathy and cryptococcosis was suspected.
Clinical, radiographic and ultrasound examinations revealed lesions in various locations of the skeletal system.
The oral and nasal cavity in addition to retrobulbar and intraocular lesions.
Cryptococcus neoformans was detected microbially and histologically.
Euthanasia was performed because of the poor prognosis.
Post mortem, further lesions were evident in the central nervous system, the spleen, the lung and different lymph nodes.

Murray RW; Speare R Australian Veterinary Practitioner v.25(2): p.68-72; 4 ref (1995) Descriptors: shelters; age; animal-welfare
Abstract: During August, 1991, 328 pets (206 dogs, 116 cats and 6 others) were killed in the adjacent cities of Townsville and Thuringowa for humanitarian and animal control reasons.
Of these, private veterinary clinics accounted for 52% of the dogs and 57% of the cats, while an animal shelter handled the rest.
The dogs killed at the animal shelter were significantly younger than those at the veterinary clinics (mean ages 1.4 years and 4.7 years, respectively), a greater percentage were sexually entire and a greater percentage were killed because they were unwanted (73.7% vs. 15%).
Cats killed at the shelter were much younger than those killed at the clinics (mean ages 0.9 years and 6.3 years, respectively).
Estimates of the numbers of dogs and cats disposed of in the cities of Townsville and Thuringowa for the 12 months from September, 1990 to August 1991 were 2533 dogs and 2385 cats, representing about 12% of the estimated total population.

Abstract: The isolated heads of a Friesian bull and three large, Large White pigs were shot from various aspects with a 12-gauge shotgun using both a single 28g solid lead projectile and buckshot, the latter consisting of 9 individual lead pellets with a combined mass of 28g.
The sites of impact to the skull included the conventional frontal region, an occipital site and immediately behind the ear.
A live mature Large White sow was shot with buckshot in the depression just caudal to the right ear, resulting in immediate insensibility and death.
The damage caused to the isolated heads indicated that similar effects could be expected if the heads had been part of intact living animals.
It is suggested that buckshot fired from a 12-gauge shotgun may be suitable for the emergency slaughter or euthanasia of a wide variety of domestic livestock and other species of animal.
