Institutes and Research Divisions National Institute of Mental Health [line_red.gif] Mission The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provides leadership at a national level on brain research, mental illness, and mental health.
It plans, conducts, fosters, and supports an integrated and coordinated program of research, investigations, research training, and services research relating to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses, and supports basic research in related scientific areas.
Provides grants-in-aid to public and private institutions and individuals in fields related to its areas of interest, including research project, program project, and research center grants.
Conducts a diversified program of intramural and collaborative research in its own laboratories and clinics.
Provides contracts for the funding of research and research support projects in areas related to the brain, mental illness, and mental health.
In many years of work with animals as well as human subjects, NIMH researchers have advanced understanding of the brain and vastly expanded the capability of mental health professionals to diagnose, treat, and prevent mental and brain disorders.
The institute also conducts information and educational activities, including the dissemination of information and educational materials on mental illness, for health professionals and the lay public, and maintains relationships with professional associations international, national, and state and local officials and voluntary agencies and organizations working in the areas of mental health and mental illness.
Important Events in NIMH History 1773--Three years before the Declaration of Independence was written, the first hospital for the mentally ill in the U.S. opened in Williamsburg, Va. 1775--In the late 18th century, mental illness in this country finally received scientific attention, from Dr. Benjamin Rush.
As part of his program to improve the care given mental patients admitted to the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Dr. Rush struck at the hearsay, superstition, and ignorance surrounding mental illness.
He introduced occupational therapy, amusements, and exercise for patients and saw to it that they had decent, clean quarters.
For his accomplishments, Dr. Rush is known as the "Father of American Psychiatry."
1840--In 1840 there were only eight asylums for the insane in the U.S. Dorothea Dixs crusading led to establishment or enlargement of 32 mental hospitals, and transfer of the mentally ill from poorhouses and jails.
The first attempt to measure the extent of mental illness and mental retardation in the United states occurred with the U.S. Census of 1840.
The census included the category insane and idiotic.
1855--The Government Hospital for the Insane opened in Washington, D.C.
It was renamed St. Elizabeths Hospital in 1916.
1900--Early in the 20th century, the "mental hygiene" movement came into being, due largely to the efforts of Clifford Beers in New England.
A former mental patient, Beers shocked readers with a graphic account of hospital conditions depicted in his famous book, The Mind that Found Itself.
The inspection of immigrants at Ellis Island included screening to detect the mentally disturbed and retarded among the thousands of men, women, and children arriving daily.
The high incidence of mental disorders found among the immigrants prompted public recognition of mental illness as a national health problem.
1929--The establishment of two Federal Narcotics farms was authorized within the PHS.
The Lexington Hospital opened in 1935 and the Fort Worth Hospital in 1938.
Both facilities participated in pioneering research on drug abuse, carried forward by the Addiction Research Center at Lexington, which later moved to Baltimore.
1930--The PHS established the Narcotics Division, later named Division of Mental Hygiene.
The division brought together for the first time the threads of the mental health movement--from research and treatment programs to combat drug addiction to the study of the causes, prevalence, and means of preventing and treating nervous and mental disease.
Dr. Walter Treadway headed the division.
He was succeeded by Dr. Lawrence Kolb who retained the post until his retirement in 1944 when Dr. Robert H. Felix took over.
1940--The concept of a "National Psychiatric Institute" was born, but World War II intervened and the plan was not introduced before the Congress.
The war demonstrated the tremendous toll taken by mental illness.
More men received medical discharges from the Armed Forces for neuropsychiatric disorders than for any other reason more than 1 million Americans were rejected for military service for that reason.
1944--It was soon evident that there were severe shortages of professional mental health personnel and that understanding of the causes, treatment, and prevention of mental illness lagged far behind other fields of medical science and public health.
Dr. William Menninger, chief of Army neuropsychiatry and an outstanding leader of the profession, called for Federal action.
The new director of the PHS Division of Mental Hygiene, Dr. Robert H. Felix, presented a proposal for a national mental health program to the Surgeon General of the U.S.
This proposal was to form the basis of the National Mental Health Act of 1946.
1946--On July 3 President Truman signed the National Mental Health Act which called for the establishment of a National Institute of Mental Health.
The first meeting of the National Advisory Mental Health Council was held on August 15.
Since no Federal funds were available, the Greentree Foundation awarded a grant of $15,000 to finance the meeting.
1947-- On July 1 the first mental health research grant (MH-1) was awarded to Dr. Winthrop N. Kellogg of Indiana University by the Division of Mental Hygiene.
It was titled Basic Nature of the Learning Process.
The National Reporting Program on Patients in Mental Institutions was transferred from the U.S. Census Bureau to the Division of Mental Hygiene.
1948-- Congress did not appropriate funds to implement the National Mental Health Act until fiscal year 1948.
1949-- On April 15 the NIMH was established with the abolishment of the Division of Mental Hygiene.
NIMH was one of the first four NIH institutes.
1955-- The Mental Health Study Act of 1955 called for an objective, thorough, nationwide analysis and reevaluation of the human and economic problems of mental health.
The act furnished the basis for the historic study conducted by the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health.
The commission's final report, Action for Mental Health, provided the background for President John F. Kennedys special message to Congress on mental health.
The number of patients in mental hospitals began to decline reflecting the introduction of psychopharmacology in the treatment of mental illness.
1956-- Congress appropriated $12 million for research in the clinical and basic aspects of psychopharmacology and the Psychopharmacology Service Center was established.
The Health Amendments Act authorized the support of community services for the mentally ill, such as halfway houses, daycare, and aftercare under Title V. 1961-- Action for Mental Health, the final report of the Joint Commission on Mental Health and Illness, was transmitted to Congress.
A 10-volume series, it assessed mental health conditions and resources throughout the U.S. to arrive at a national program that would approach adequacy in meeting the individual needs of the mentally ill people of America.
1963-- President Kennedy submitted a special message to Congress on mental health issues.
Passage of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, an outgrowth of President Kennedys message, began a new era in Federal support for mental health services.
1965-- During the mid-1960s NIMH launched an extensive attack on special mental health problems.
Established were centers for child and family mental health, crime and delinquency, minority group mental health problems, schizophrenia, urban problems, and later, rape, aging, and technical assistance to victims of natural disasters.
The mental health centers staffing amendments authorized grants to help pay the salaries of professional and technical personnel in Community Mental Health Centers.
The Joint Commission on Mental Health of Children was established by Congress to recommend national action for child mental health.
1966-- Despite the large population directly affected, alcohol abuse and alcoholism did not receive full recognition as a major public health problem until the mid-1960s.
The National Center for Prevention and Control of Alcoholism was established as part of NIMH.
Four years later it became a division on its way to institute status.
A research program on drug abuse was inaugurated with the establishment of the Center for Studies of Narcotic and Drug Abuse within NIMH. Division status followed in 1968, with institute status in 1972.
1967-- NIMH was separated from NIH and raised to bureau status in PHS by a reorganization that became effective January 1.
NIMHs Division of Clinical, Behavioral and Biological Research, within the Mental Health Intramural Research Program, comprising activities conducted in the Clinical Center and other NIH facilities, continued at NIH under an agreement for joint administration between NIH and NIMH.
On August 13 DHEW Secretary John W. Gardner transferred St. Elizabeths Hospital, the Federal Governments only civilian psychiatric hospital, to NIMH. 1968-- NIMH became a component of PHSs Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA).
1969-- Crisis in Child Mental Health, the report of the Joint Commission on Mental Health of Children, was made public.
1970-- Dr. Julius Axelrod, an NIMH researcher, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research into the chemistry of nerve transmission for discoveries concerning the humoral transmitters in the nerve terminals and the mechanisms for their storage, release and inactivation.
He found an enzyme that terminates the action of the nerve transmitter, noradrenaline.
FDA approved the use of lithium as an anti-manic based upon NIMH research.
This led to a savings of approximately $40 billion over the next couple of decades and a sharp drop of inpatient days and suicides.
The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act established the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism within NIMH. 1971-- A group of 17 national health and mental health organizations sponsored a 2-day conference honoring the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the National Mental Health Act.
1972-- The Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act established a National Institute on Drug Abuse within NIMH. 1973-- NIMH temporarily rejoined NIH on July 1 with the abolishment of HSMHA.
On September 25 the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA)--composed of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and NIMH--was established administratively by the DHEW secretary as the successor organization to HSMHA.
A task force consisting of over 300 consultants, was established to review and analyze the 25-year history of federally sponsored research programs in mental health.
Their report, Research in the Service of Mental Health, was issued in 1975.
1974-- ADAMHA was officially established on May 4 when President Nixon signed P.L. 93-282.
1975-- The community mental health centers program was given added impetus with the passage of the CMHC amendments of 1975.
1977-- President Carter established the Presidents Commission on Mental Health on February 17 by Executive Order No. 11973.
The commission was to review the mental health needs of the Nation and to make recommendations to the President as to how the Nation might best meet these needs.
1978-- Dr. Solomon H. Snyder, an NIMH grantee, was awarded the Albert Lasker Award in Basic Medical Research for his pioneering work in identifying the opiate receptors, and the demonstration of their relation to the enkephalins, natural chemicals released by the brain which have the effect of relieving pain and influencing emotional behavior.
The Report to the President from the President's Commission on Mental Health was submitted.
1980-- The Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study, a unique and massive research effort in which more than 20,000 persons were interviewed, began.
The field interviews and first wave analysis were completed in 1985.
Data from the ECA provide an accurate picture of rates of mental and addictive disorders and services usage.
The Mental Health Systems Act, which was based on the Report to the President from the President's Commission on Mental Health and was designed to provide improved services for the mentally ill, was passed.
1981-- President Reagan signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.
This act repealed the Mental Health Systems Act and consolidated ADAMHAs treatment and rehabilitation service programs into a single block grant that enabled each State to administer its allocated funds.
With the repeal of the community mental health legislation and the establishment of block grants the Federal role in services to the mentally ill became one of providing technical assistance to increase the capacity of State and local providers of mental health services.
Dr. Louis Sokoloff, an NIMH researcher, was given the Albert Lasker Award in Clinical Medical Research for developing a new method of measuring brain function that contributes to basic understanding and diagnosis of brain diseases.
His technique involving measuring the brains utilization of glucose led to the development of the PET scanner, which produces color images showing glucose utilization in the living, functional brain.
Dr. Roger W. Sperry, an NIMH grantee, shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Drs. David Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel.
It was awarded for his discoveries concerning functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres.
1983-- Dr. Eric R. Kandel, an NIMH grantee, was awarded the Albert Lasker Award in Medical Research for application of cell biology techniques to the study of behavior, revealing the mechanisms underlying learning and memory.
1985-- A major reorganization to align the extramural structure to emphasize the institutes primary mission of research was accomplished.
This provided for an increased focus on understanding the biological and behavioral underpinnings of mental illness and mental health and for improving the treatment/prevention of mental and emotional disorders.
1986-- A 2-day scientific seminar, which was held to honor the 40th anniversary of the National Mental Health Act, took place in Washington, D.C.
It was sponsored by the organizing committee for the 40th anniversary commemoration and the MacArthur Foundation.

Work is conducted in laboratories at three main facilities located on the main campus of NIH in Bethesda, Md.,at the Neuroscience Center at St. Elizabeths Hospital (NSCSE) in the District of Columbia, and at the NIH Animal Center (NIHAC) in Poolesville, Md.
Broad spectra of adult and childhood psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness, are studied in patients at both the NIH and St. Elizabeths facilities.
In addition, hundreds of basic neuroscience projects examining many aspects of central nervous system structure and function are carried out at all three facilities.
Behavior, both normal and pathological, is studied through an interdisciplinary approach.
A variety of methods is used to correlate changes in neuronal function with behavior and to identify and measure the neurochemical and neurophysiological substrates of behavior.
The regulation of central nervous system metabolism is examined at various levels to determine its role in relationship to health and disease.
Relatively noninvasive brain imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), and functional magnetic resonance are used to study living subjects in various physiologic and pathologic states.
Molecular studies focus on many aspects of synaptic neurotransmission, including the biosynthesis, release, reuptake, and metabolism of neurotransmitters.
The effects of disease, dietary changes, hormones, and drugs on synaptic events constitute a major area of investigation within DIRP.
Clinical pharmacological studies designed to improve treatment of the mentally ill center on work with psychoactive and psychotherapeutic drugs.
Included in these studies are efforts to identify biological events and clinical measures that can serve as predictors of therapeutic response to these drugs.
Other work includes characterization of receptors for neurotransmitters and psychoactive substances whose mechanisms of action are unknown.
Studies of the regulation and action of receptors at the cellular level constitute a major area of investigation.
Genetic studies include molecular genetic analyses of psychiatric and neurologic disorders, pharmacogenetic as well as epidemiologic and family studies.
Data from these projects will aid in sorting out the important and complex interactions between biological systems (i.e., the central nervous system) and the environment that determine behavior.
In the Office of the Director, DIRP, are five research sections: socio-environmental stuides; genetics; pharmacology; preclinical neuroscience; and cognitive neuroscience.
Other branches and laboratories are devoted to: Research Services; Neuropsychiatry*; Clinical and Research Services*; Experimental Therapeutics; Biological Psychiatry; Clinical Psychobiology; Clinical Neuroscience; Clinical Neurogenetics; Veterinary Medicine and Resources; Child Psychiatry; Clinical Brain Disorders*; Neurophysiology; Clinical Science; Brain and Cognition; Cellular and Molecular Regulation; Neurochemistry; Cerebral Metabolism; Systems Neuroscience**; Biochemical Genetics; Behavioral Endocrinology; Neurotoxicology; Geriatric Psychiatry; and Developmental Neurobiology.

Division of Extramural Activities
The most important responsibility of the DEA is to oversee the review of grant applications.
Its aim is to provide every applicant with expert and fair review of his or her application and thereby ensure that NIMH supports the research and other activities that offer the greatest promise of furthering knowledge relevant to mental health and mental illness.
DEA also provides committee management services and oversees activities of the National Advisory Mental Health Council, the advisory body to NIMH.
In these and other ways, DEA exercises leadership in developing, implementing, and coordinating NIMH extramural programs and policies.
DEA consists of the Office of the Director, Office of Grant Referral and three branches: Clinical Review; Neuroscience Review; and Behavioral and Applied Review.
Each branch administers the initial review groups (IRGs) which provide scientific and technical review of applications for research and training grants, fellowships, and cooperative agreements, as well as concept review for research and development contracts.
The branches of DEA monitor the review process to ensure quality and conformity to policy.
They also interpret the IRGs' recommendations to the National Advisory Mental Health Council.
DEA is responsible for management and logistics of the meetings of the council grant review.
A member of DEA staff serves as executive secretary to the council grant review.
The division takes steps to ensure that grant applications reviewed by the institute adhere to guidelines on ethical conduct of research and provide for the inclusion of women and minorities in studies on human populations.
The division also promotes adherence to safeguards for human and animal research.
DEA also oversees the issuance of program announcements and requests for applications (RFAs) that let the research community know what kinds of studies NIMH is most interested in supporting.
Ensuring that these announcements and RFAs are clearly written, programmatically accurate, and faithfully conform to relevant criteria is DEAs responsibility.
Office of the Associate Director for Prevention
This office provides leadership in the coordination of institute programs concerning the prevention of mental disorders and the promotion of mental health.
This is done by setting institute goals and priorities, as well as by assessing, developing planning and executing internal and external strategies to implement the institute's prevention research policy.
For example, the office sponsors national conferences, convenes groups of prevention experts to increase the quality of prevention science and facilitates the preparation of scientific reports on prevention science.
In addition the office collaborates with Federal agencies, national organizations and coalitions, state, local, and consumer groups with interests in prevention.
It also collaborates with the Office of Disease Prevention, the NIH prevention research coordinating committee, and other private and public organizations.
Office of Rural Mental Health Research
The ORMHR directs, plans, coordinates, and supports research activities and information dissemination on conditions unique to those living in rural areas, including research on the delivery of mental health services to such areas.
Also coordinates related departmental research activities and related activities of public and nonprofit entities.
Office of the Associate Director for Special Populations
The associate director for special populations provides leadership, advice, and coordination in developing, and fostering implementation of NIMH programmatic and administrative policies to promote mental health concerns of racial/ethnic minorities and women initiates and advances plans, policies, and activities to improve health and mental health of the Nation's women and racial/ethnic minorities.
The office uses program planning, research, research training and public educational activities to promote mental health and prevent mental illness among women and racial/ethnic minorities; provides leadership in establishment and maintenance of organizational linkages and collaborates on mental health concerns of women and racial/ethnic minorities with components of HHS, other Federal agencies, professional organizations, and other health organizations and institutions; monitors progress of division-level goals and programs which bear on racial/ethnic minority and womens issues; and provides leadership and program guidance for the Career Opportunities in Research Education and Training Program (COR), the Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program (M-RISP), and the Supplements for Underrepresented Minorities in Biomedical and Behavioral Research Program.
The COR Honors Undergraduate Program assists institutions with substantial enrollment of racial/ethnic minority students in training of greater numbers of scientists as teachers and researchers in disciplines related to research in mental health.
The M-RISP provides grants to institutions with a substantial enrollment of racial/ethnic minority students for support of research projects, enhancement of existing research infrastructure, and for advanced training of faculty.
These grants also provide support for graduate and undergraduate students to serve as research associates on M-RISP projects.
The Supplements for Underrepresented Minorities in Biomedical and Behavioral Research are administrative supplements to existing research grants for research and salary support for high school students, undergraduate students, graduate research assistants, and junior level investigators.
The proposed research must be an integral part of the ongoing research of the parent grant supported by NIMH.
The purpose of the supplemental awards is to enhance the research capability of the minority student or faculty member, and to provide opportunites for minority individuals to develop as independent, competitive researchers.
Also, supplements exist to promote reentry into biomedical and biobehavioral research careers.
This program offers administrative supplements to currently funded NIMH research grants to support individuals with high potential to reenter an active research career after taking time to care for children or parents or to attend to other family responsibilities.
