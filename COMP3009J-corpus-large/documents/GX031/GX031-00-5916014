Dimension Stone is natural stone that can be cut or shaped to a specific size.
Dimension stone, a traditional building material, is mostly used for construction either for structural or decorative uses.
For hundreds of years or more dimension stone has been the main load bearing material used in construction of major buildings and bridges.
In modern construction granite blocks, sandstone slabs and slate shingles have been largely replaced by steel, reinforced concrete and aluminum sheets.
Today dimension stone is used in a decorative rather than a structural role.
Examples of Uses for Dimension Stone
PRODUCT USES sandstone blocks foundations, stonewall polished marble slabs cladding building, bathroom vanities polished granite slabs headstones, kitchen counters slate roofing shingles, pool table tops, floor tiles
Dimension Stone markets have grown considerably since the 1970's.
Improved technology has allowed cutting of thin rock slabs at prices attractive to the private home market.
New technology has reduced production costs and increased production capacity in many quarries.
Most rocks are unsuited for dimension stone being either too fractured, too weathered, too inconsistent or just plain unattractive.
Granite, limestone and sandstone are the three rock types most commonly used for dimension stones.
Granite, gabbro and other coarse grained igneous rocks are very durable foroutside decoration of buildings.
These rocks have low porosity and permeabilityand relatively slowly reactive minerals.
Limestone and sandstone were very popular as building stones in the last century .
Unfortunately they are susceptible to chemical attack by acidic rainfall (acid rain) and also to mechanical wear when used as steps and floor tiles.
Limestones and sandstones are typically considerably more porous and permable than igneous rocks.
This characteristic together with the susceptibility of calcite to dissolution by acids in rainfall (and moisture condensing directly from the atmosphere), makes limestone and calcite cemented sandstone strongly subject to weathering.
In contemporary building limestone, sandstone and other porousrocks are used mostly on interior walls of buildings where their natural colors and texture can be used to great advantage.
Dimension Stone quarry operations in Virginia include: Slate Company : Le Seur - Richmond Slate Corporation Location : 2 quarries and plant near Arvonia, Buckingham County
Products : slate shingles, flooring tiles, hearths Diabase Company : New England Stone Location : southern Culpepper County Products : diabase slabs for monuments Quartzite Company : Carter Stone Company Location : south of Lynchburg, Campbell County Products : flagging stones [desert.gif] Market Demand for Dimension Stone Dimension Stone has been in strong demand for the past 20 years or more.
Designers and architects seeking a more natural look have turned increasinglyto stone products.
Stone has become a fashionable material for designers.
As a result the market demands a constantly changing supply of different colors and rock textures.
Dimension Stone production in the U.S. in recent years has been greater than a million tons, worth over $200 million annually.
Much of the dimension stone produced has a high value added factor.
Special preparation (such as making shingles) greatly adds to the value of the rock per ton.
Because of the relatively high value of dimension stone quarry location and distance to market is not as critical as with crushed stone.
Dimension Stone production in Virginia is proprietory however.
This production does contribute significantly to the over $80 million of production of combined industrial mineral produced within the Commonwealth.

How is Dimension Stone Produced?
Dimension Stone production requires special quarrying methods.
Most aggregate quarries use large amounts of high explosives to fracture and move large rock volumes.
Some dimension stone quarries have been effectively ruined by fracturing resulting from overuse of explosives.
Although some quarries use low powered or soft explosives to good effect, other techniques are typically used for successful dimension stone quarrying.
Examples of such techniques include the use of :
thermal lance wire saw chain saw with tungsten cutting teeth stick drilling plug and feather high pressure water jet
Typically the strategy is to get a 20 ton or less block free that can be moved to the plant for sawing, splitting etc.
