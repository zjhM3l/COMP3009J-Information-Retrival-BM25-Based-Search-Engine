[newbanner.jpg] STATE DEPARTMENTS CELEBRATE DIVERSITY DAY TRENTON, N.J., Sept. 10, 2003- Three state departments celebrated the rich cultural heritage and diversity of state government with the annual Diversity Day celebration Wednesday.
The state Department of Labor, joined by the Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Senior Services, held a lunchtime celebration with a diverse mix of food, music, and performances representing the rich traditions of so many members of the state's diverse workforce.
"New Jersey has become a leader in promoting diversity," said Department of Labor Commissioner Albert G. Kroll.
"Through our example, this vision of diversity will be shared in businesses throughout the state, opening them up to new business opportunities, expanding their workforce base, and building the type of workplaces envisioned by our country's highest ideals."
Kroll said Wednesday's celebration reflected the diversity of state government, which has been a key goal of the McGreevey administration.
"Valuing diversity enhances our capacity to unite people to improve the quality of life in the workplace," Kroll said.
"Naturally there is still work to be done, but it is the department's policy to create and maintain an organizational culture that incorporates into its entire operation a positive work environment that enables all employees to achieve their full potential."
Kroll cited the department's Equity Committee and its reinstituted Employee of the Month program as examples of promoting the department's diverse workforce and addressing its concerns.
