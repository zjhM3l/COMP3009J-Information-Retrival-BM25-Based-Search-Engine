Government Accountability Notes from the AIRC A Word From the Center _______________________________________________________________________
Government Accountability Government accountability - that is, the duty of public officials to report their actions to the citizens, and the right of the citizens to take action against those officials whose conduct the citizens consider unsatisfactory - is an essential element, perhaps the most essential element, of any democracy.
How does this work in practice in the United States? The Constitution First, we start with the Constitution.
The Constitution of the United States requires that Congress keep a record of its proceedings, including of the votes that are placed.
It also requires that the President give to Congress a status report on the country - this has become the annual State of the Union address - and that the Presidents reasons for any veto be published in the Congressional record.
The Constitution also obligates the federal government to make its financial accounts public.
The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides for public trials, thus keeping the judiciary in check.
In addition, the Constitution subjects all civil officers of the government who commit any act of malfeasance to removal from office, impeachment, and conviction.
The fifty state constitutions have similar provisions.
There are also many more legal guarantees contained in federal and/or state statutes.
For example, citizens may have the right to inspect public records, candidates for public office may have to reveal the names of those who contributed to their campaigns, public officials may be obligated to disclose their sources of income, and legislative meetings might have to be open to the public.
Separation of Powers Since the founding of the United States, we have also relied heavily on the separation of powers to keep our officials in line.
In principle, this means that the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of our government are separate and distinct in their powers, but with the ability to check and restrain each other.
The separation of powers works in conjunction with federalism, which means that each governmental task is assigned to the smallest, most local government unit able to perform it.
The U.S. Constitution drafted in 1787 gives to the federal government such powers as the conduct of foreign relations, issues of war and peace, and the regulation of commerce among states and with foreign countries.
The federal government is not involved with, say, fixing potholes on local roads, educational curricula, or the appointment of local officials.
The method in which the courts exercise and enforce government accountability was not established by the Constitution but through a landmark 1803 Supreme Court decision, Marbury v. Madison.
This case established the principle that all laws and other governmental actions must conform to the Constitution, and that any individual who believes that his or her constitutional rights are being violated by any level of government federal, state, or local may obtain redress through appropriate litigation.
This is known as judicial review.
In one well-known case in 1974, President Richard Nixon refused to hand over tape recordings of conversations which were reported to be relevant to the Watergate burglary and cover-up.
The Supreme Court decided against the President and ordered him to deliver the tapes to the criminal court that was trying the case.
The Court reasoned that while the president does enjoy an executive privilege, which enables him to maintain the confidentiality of presidential conversations, that privilege is not absolute, but rather must be weighed against the countervailing interest in disclosure in individual circumstances.
The Court concluded that since President Nixon had not asserted any particular need for secrecy, his interests were outweighed by the obvious need to maintain the integrity of the criminal process.
As many may remember, the president promptly delivered the tapes to the criminal court.
The Media An additional check on the government is the media.
The First Amendment to the Constitution provides for freedom of speech, press, assembly, petition, and association, or, collectively, freedom of expression.
A free press provides voters with the information they need to make informed decisions by facilitating an exchange of political discourse.
The media sometimes go further, however.
Using the Watergate era as an example again, it was two Washington Post reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who doggedly pursued information about the burglary and the burglars connections to the executive branch of the government.
While they were not the first reporters to challenge our government, they have been an inspiration to many young journalists since that time.
In order to do their job as government watchdogs, media organizations develop very strict rules for their journalists and interaction with the government.
For example, many media organizations forbid their journalists from accepting meals and/or travel from government employees.
Media organizations pay big bucks for their journalists to accompany the President, the Secretary of State, and other government officials on domestic and foreign trips.
Limits to Accountability Courts have acknowledged that the governments responsibilities towards national security may outweigh the reasons for disclosing information.
Proceedings involving national security may be exempted from disclosure requirements.
In addition, where national security is concerned, public trials may be substituted by fair but closed trials.
Acts and Practices One of the authors of our Constitution and later our fourth president, James Madison wrote, A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy or perhaps both.
Madison perhaps foresaw the federal Freedom of Information Act and the similar statutes now on the books of all 50 states.
Federal law requires that some documents be placed in public reading rooms and that other information be made available upon request, without the requester having to give a reason for the request.
Exemptions include classified documents related to national defense, certain legal enforcement strategies, privileged financial information, and invasions of personal property.
The 1996 Electronic Freedom of Information Act requires that agencies provide electronic access to certain types of documents.
The Ethics in Government Act provides for, among other things, public financial disclosure by government officials and civil servants.
Financial disclosure gives citizens sufficient information to judge whether the actions of those officials are likely to be influenced improperly by their own financial interests.
This is primarily a preventive tool because, with early disclosure, agencies can then change the duties of employees or counsel them with regard to the measures that must be taken in order to avoid actual conflict.
The Federal Register is the official daily publication for rules and notices of federal agencies and organizations, as well as executive orders and other presidential documents.
This is also where the public can read about proposed laws, rules, and regulations.
These are published in the Federal Register in order to give interested persons an opportunity to participate in rule-making prior to the adoption of the final rules.
Public hearings on proposed rules are also published here.
Instructions for filing comments are provided.
The Federal Register serves more mundane purposes as well, functioning as a sort of governmental wish list.
For example, when the State Department has money for linkages between American and foreign universities, it would announce this in the Federal Register along with the guidelines for applying for the funding.
Additional acts include the Sunshine in Government Act, which provides for open meetings, with notices published in the Federal Register ahead of time, and the Privacy Act that provides access to government documents for people wishing to review any files kept on them.
The Whistleblower Protection Act protects from retaliation federal employees who disclose information regarding official conduct that the employees reasonably believe is a violation of law, rule or regulation, a gross waste of funds, gross mismanagement, abuse of authority, or a danger to public health and safety.
History has shown that open and transparent governments are less susceptible to corruption.
U.S. Government Integrity Systems and Ethics Over the last two centuries, the U.S. federal government has developed a comprehensive structure of laws and regulations designed to prevent, detect, and remedy conduct by government agencies and officials that is not in the public interest.
The overarching purpose of this legal framework is to promote institutional integrity as well as the personal integrity of each federal employee.
Many of the basic components of the legal framework supporting government integrity in the U.S. arose from events involving great national tension wars, assassinations, and resignations with refinements occurring over time.
The fundamental assumption behind these laws is that government employees are public servants or public trustees and that individual integrity is essential for the health of our government.
The activities of any government are carried out by individuals.
Early in U.S. history, holding a government job was based upon a so-called spoils system, and individual conduct was not closely controlled.
As each president was elected, he brought with him individuals who had supported his election.
This still happens today with a limited number of political appointments, some of which are subject to Congressional approval.
But today, individuals with influence in a new presidents administration can no longer sell their ability to secure jobs for others for a percentage of their salaries.
In the old days, people would shell out money in order to secure government jobs because they knew they would later be able to reimburse themselves in other ways from the public treasury.
Jobs in particular demand were those that allowed the holder to collect funds from the public.
Integrity or competence was not of primary importance in the selection of these employees.
After the appointed Collector of the Port of New York absconded with over $1 million dollars of public funds in the 1830s, however, the grossly corrupted federal service became a national scandal.
Reforms were implemented over time, with the first comprehensive civil service law finally enacted in 1883, establishing an examination process for fitness and competency, promotions on the basis of merit, and a fair system of job and pay classification requirements.
The civil service exam was abolished 100 years later as it was judged too cumbersome and not responsive to federal agencies needs, but the basic tenets of the 1883 law merit and competency, combined with more recent concepts such as equal opportunity still form the basis of our civil service employment system.
Decades later, in the mid-20th century, restrictions limiting the political activities of government employees were enacted.
The restrictions serve two purposes: to protect employees from requests from office seekers for assistance in their elections and to protect the public from having government employees use the authority and resources of their offices to help particular candidates.
The 1960s saw the creation of conflict of interest laws governing public servants that not only addressed conflicts of interest, but also the appearance of such conflicts.
These laws direct government employees to avoid any action that might result in or create the appearance of using public office for private gain, giving preferential treatment to any organization or person, impeding government efficiency or economy, losing complete independence or impartiality of action, making a government decision outside official channels, or adversely affecting the confidence of the public in the integrity of the government.
The next decade saw public confidence in our government shaken by the Watergate scandal.
In reaction to this, Congress created internal agency watchdogs, known as inspectors general, to audit operations and programs, to recommend improvements to economy, efficiency, and effectiveness, and to detect fraud and abuse.
In addition, the Office of Government Ethics was created to oversee a prevention program consisting of public financial disclosure, counseling, and education, and to establish an ethics policy for the entire executive branch.
In the legislative branch, the Senate and the House are responsible for determining the qualifications and setting the behavior standards of their own members.
Each has a specific ethics committee and its own rules of conduct.
Although members of Congress and Senators are democratically elected by their constituents, the House and Senate may expel their members on the grounds of misconduct without having to wait for voters to recall their representatives through elections.
The judicial branch has its own codes of conduct and disciplinary process.
Those judges who are guilty of serious misconduct, however, may be convicted by the House and impeached by the Senate.
Impeached federal judges are prosecuted by the Department of Justice for criminal violations.
Criminal conflict of interest statutes prohibit officers and employees of all three branches from accepting bribes or gratuities, from representing private individuals in matters before the government, and from sharing in a claim against the government.
Executive branch officials are prohibited from acting in any government matter in which they, a spouse, or a child or certain types of organizations with which they have a fiduciary or employment relationship, have a financial interest.
They are also prohibited from accepting from private sources payment for their government services.
However, a nuclear arms analyst for the Department of State may accept payment for articles she writes on wine for a local newspaper, for example, or a Department of Justice lawyer can be paid for her services as a preacher on Sundays, as these activities have nothing to do with their government jobs.
Finally, former officers and employees of the executive and legislative branches are restricted, for certain periods of time after leaving government service, from representing others to or before the government on certain types of matters.
Jane S. Ley, former Deputy Director for Government Relations and Special Projects, U.S. Office of Government Ethics has written Beginning with the Constitution itself, the United States has developed an interdependent system of laws and regulations that promote and require integrity and ethics.
This system is designed to promote institutional integrity through the establishment of consistent, fair, and public procedures for carrying out the business of government and to promote individual employee integrity through the establishment of fair, consistent, and enforceable standards of ethical conduct.
It is a system that has evolved over time and must and will need to continue to adapt to new challenges, such as the changing role and scope of government itself and the effect and sometimes stress of new technologies on government processes.
Citizen Participation In any democracy, the most important guarantee of government accountability is the right of citizens to control their government through elections.
James Madison wrote not only that all power should be derived from the people, but those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people.
Citizens groups such as Common Cause, Public Citizen, and the Center for Public Integrity have made public activity or inactivity their focus of attention and reason for being.
All levels of government are now subject to monitoring by these groups and others that look at issues such as election financing, consumer concerns such as food safety, corporate accountability, and public education.
More important than any group, however, is the individual.
The primary public tool in accountability is the individual vote.
In the U.S., we directly elect government officials.
In at least 26 states, we also vote on specific issues.
These are in form of referenda where state legislatures refer a proposed or existing law to the voters for their approval or rejection or ballot measures that allow voters to cast ballots on specific proposals.
Ballot measures and referenda are known as direct democracy or direct accountability.
Ballot measures may include questions about raising or imposing taxes, instituting or dropping term limits, restructuring the governing bodies of state universities, or, as in the Florida elections last November, mandating the humane treatment of pregnant pigs.
Voters can have issues placed on the ballot through petition drives the collection of a specified number of signatures.
Rules for ballot measures and referenda vary from state to state but all are ultimately subject to judicial review.
In certain cases, governments may be required to place issues before the voters.
Changes to state constitutions are usually done through ballot referenda, for example.
Voting on candidates, for ballot measures, or on referenda all depend heavily on an informed electorate and access to the media for all sides of an issue.
Fans of ballot measures see them as a useful check on ill-considered actions, while critics call them an unnecessary check on representative government.
Ballot measures raise the question of whether they are a threat to the tradition of representative government.
Voters seem to like them though.
The number of ballot measures has mushroomed over the last couple of decades.
Discussion about them is yet one more reminder that we cannot take democracy for granted.
Whether we are citizens, civil servants, or elected officials, the bottom line is that in protecting a democracy, we must all be vigilant.
We must encourage open and vigorous debate.
We must make decisions based on moral sense and on the desire to leave the world in better shape for our children and their children.

A Word From the Center H. L. Mencken once said that the cure for the evils of democracy is more democracy, but sometimes we may go too far.
A couple of months ago when my property tax bill didnt show up, I went on line and within minutes was able to find out how much I owed.
For kicks, I then checked out how much my neighbors owed.
On the one hand, I was pleased to conduct my business with so little hassle.
On the other, I was appalled that anyone could be privy to my personal tax bill.
But where do we draw the line? As with the relationship between different levels of government and our complex system for distributing power, the relationship between individuals and the state will continue to evolve.
We just need to make sure that the evolution proceeds in the right direction, and that the benefit of the people is always the primary goal and that the people exercise their choices wisely.
