The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Hearing on Coast Guard FY 2001 Supplemental Funding Needs __________________________________________________________________ TABLE OF CONTENTS(Click on Section) PURPOSE BACKGROUND WITNESSES __________________________________________________________________ PURPOSE On March 8, 2001, the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation will conduct an oversight hearing on the Coast Guards fiscal year 2001 shortfall of approximately $91 million.
This shortfall has resulted in a 10 percent reduction in Coast Guard operations.
Emergency supplemental funding is necessary to cover the Coast Guard funding shortfall and avoid a 30 percent reduction in operations during the third and fourth quarters of the year.
BACKGROUND
CRITICAL FISCAL YEAR 2001 COAST GUARD BUDGET SHORTFALL
In the past, the Coast Guard has deferred maintenance on vessels and shore facilities, cannibalized aircraft, and significantly increased the number of hours that personnel work to overcome budget shortfalls.
However, the Coast Guard has deferred maintenance on its aircraft, vessels and shore facilities to the point that it is no longer able to sustain its typical level of operations.
During fiscal year 2001, the Coast Guard has diverted funds from its law enforcement operations to pay for unbudgeted cost increases related to new and expanded personnel entitlement programs enacted under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, unanticipated fuel cost increases, and shortages of critical aviation spare parts.
In February 2001, the Commandant authorized his Operational Commanders to reduce operations by 10 percent and is projecting a 30 percent nation-wide reduction in operations starting this April.
The Coast Guard has identified a $91 million fiscal year 2001 funding shortfall comprised of:
* $36 million for new and expanded entitlements enacted in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001.
* $27 million for critical aviation spare parts.
* $28 million for unanticipated Department of Defense fuel contract and utilities cost increases.
According to the Coast Guard, the current operational cutbacks are required to preserve search and rescue capability, critical personnel training, and contract obligations.
The impact of a 30 percent operational reduction is a direct decrease in law enforcement activities, including drug and migrant interdiction as well as fisheries law enforcement.
In addition, the reduced operational presence may increase response times to areas where search and rescue cases often occur such as fishing grounds and high traffic migrant areas.
The Coast Guard is requesting to be included in any Department of Defense emergency supplemental request submitted by the Administration.
ANALYSIS OF THE COAST GUARDS BUDGET
Congress appropriated $3.192 billion for Coast Guard Operating Expenses (OE) in fiscal year 2001, a $336 million or 12 percent increase over the fiscal year 2000 appropriated level.
This figure was $7 million less than was requested by the previous Administration.
While the requested level and appropriated level of funding was nearly identical, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which was enacted into law after the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001, contained a number of expanded personnel entitlements which had not been included in the Presidents budget request.
In fiscal year 2000, the Coast Guard received $700 million in emergency supplemental funding for increased pay, healthcare, and housing allowances required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, and to purchase six new C-130s and one Gulf-Stream aircraft.
