The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Hearing Organizational Meeting and Hearing of Oversight of United States Coast Guard Expenditures February 4, 1998 __________________________________________________________________ TABLE OF CONTENTS(Click on Section) PURPOSE OF HEARING BACKGROUND WITNESSES HEARING TRANSCRIPT __________________________________________________________________ PURPOSE OF HEARING The purpose of this hearing is to consider Coast Guard spending on operational and support programs.
The Subcommittee will receive testimony from the Director of Resources, United States Coast Guard, and members of his staff.
BACKGROUND
For fiscal year 1999, the Administration requested $4.03 billion for Coast Guard programs and activities.
Recognizing several critical under-funded areas, the Congress provided the President's full request, and an additional $248 million.
In additional to providing funds necessary to support and maintain current-level services by the Coast Guard, funds were provided by the Congress to enhance two critical mission areas: Drug Interdiction and National Security.
This memo examines Coast Guard spending from several perspectives.
First, spending has been displayed in a format paralleling the categories of the Departmental Accounting and Financial Information System.
Then, an explanation of spending by program or mission is provided.
For another view, operating costs for major assets, such as cutters and aircraft, is provided.
Finally, since personnel costs account for such a high portion of Coast Guard spending, a view of where the Coast Guard's workforce employment by unit type is provided.

As the financial data on the previous page show, excluding the fixed entitlement costs for retired pay, 95% of all the resources available to the Coast Guard are devoted to Operating Expenses and Acquisition, Construction and Improvements.
The Acquisition, Construction and Improvements account, which is the Coast Guard fund for renewing or replacing its property, plant, and equipment, has typically been funded at around $400 million per year for the past several years.
However, in the current fiscal year, an additional $227 million was provided by the Congress to acquire or improve assets for drug interdiction and military readiness.
These initiatives include additional maritime patrol aircraft, deployable pursuit boats, Barracuda-class coastal patrol boats, improved cutter sensors and communications systems, and improved aircraft sensors.
Since the Coast Guard's deepwater fleet of cutters are on average 25 years old, the Service has undertaken planning for a major recapitalization of its deepwater ships and aircraft, a project that is likely to heavily influence the capital replacement program in the coming decades.
The Acquisition, Construction and Improvements account shifts emphasis from year to year, due to the magnitude of the projects involved.
For example, in the early 1990's, significant resources were devoted to the rehabilitation of high and medium endurance cutters.
Now, as the buoy tender fleet is being replaced, a large proportion of the capital account has shifted to support Aids to Navigation.
The critical question in evaluating the adequacy of the capital account is whether the recapitalization plan is well tuned to the mission needs the Coast Guard will face ten and twenty years from now.
A perspective on the Coast Guard's current priorities can be derived from a close examination of the Operating Expenses account.
This $2.8 billion lump-sum account funds virtually all activities that directly execute or support Coast Guard missions.
Salaries and benefit costs for military and civilian personnel; fuel and parts for cutters, boats, and aircraft; training expenses; and administrative and support costs are all covered by this account.
The Coast Guard has developed a two-stage cost allocation model known as the Program Budget.
In this model, all costs incurred by all units in the Coast Guard are allocated to a mission.
Some of these allocations are straightforward.
For example, virtually all costs associated with Polar Class Icebreakers are allocated to the International Ice Mission.
By contrast, the costs incurred by a small boat station may be split among drug enforcement, illegal economic migrant enforcement, fisheries enforcement, search and rescue, recreational boating safety, and other missions based on operational activity.
The following table provides the Operating Expenses account by mission, according to the current data:
(Actual) (Actual) (Planned)
% of OE % of OE % of OE
In FY 97 In FY 98 In FY 99
Drug Interdiction 17.9% 16.6% 17.2%
Search and Rescue 12.5% 12.7% 11.6%
Aids to Navigation/Ice Operations 19.1% 19.3% 19.8%
Defense Readiness 1.7% 2.5% 2.1%
Marine Environmental Protection 10.9% 11.0% 11.5%
Other Law Enforcement 2.5% 2.6% 2.5%
Marine Transportation Safety 14.3% 14.2% 13.6%
Fisheries Law Enforcement 16.4% 16.8% 16.3%
Migrant Interdiction 4.7% 4.3% 5.4%
Another perspective on Coast Guard costs can be obtained by examining the operating cost of specific classes of asset.
For example, both high endurance cutters and patrol boats engage in drug enforcement.
Of course, the high endurance cutter has operational capabilities that far exceed those of patrol boats, just as the high endurance cutter's operating costs vastly exceed the operating costs of a patrol boat.
The trade off between cost and capability is an important Coast Guard management issue, especially in the massive Deepwater Recaptilization Project which is currently under development.
Also noteworthy is that for every dollar spent on directly operating a Coast Guard asset, about a dollar is spent in the support infrastructure, which includes supply, logistics, training, and Headquarters administration.
Asset Annual Operating Cost per Unit
378' High Endurance Cutter (12) $17,350,000
270' Medium Endurance Cutter (13) $11,277,000
210' Medium Endurance Cutter (16) $8,293,000
110' Patrol Boat (49) $2,078,000
HC-130 Patrol Aircraft (30) $5,405,000
HU-25 Jet Interceptor Aircraft (41) $2,197,000
HH-60 Medium Range Helicopter (42) $3,934,000
HH-65 Short Range Helicopter (96) $2,550,000
