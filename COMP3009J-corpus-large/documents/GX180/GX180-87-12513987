Progress on 2000 Activity 1
More than $500,000 will be spent in 2000-2001 on new and continuing research and development of IPM techniques that will enable growers to reduce their reliance on higher risk pesticides.
More than 50% of this funding is for projects directly related to our extensive IPM program and making progress toward developing and implementing IPM strategies
The projects funded for 2000-2001 include: * Ant Management in Almond * Biological Control of Ants * Evaluation of Low Risk Insecticides for San Jose Scale * Reducing Impact of OP Dormant Sprays on surface water * Alternative Dispensing Technologies for Navel Orange Worm * Insect and Mite IPM Research * Almond Cultural and Orchard Management * Nickels Soil Lab Projects * Epidemiology and Management of Almond Diseases * Biology and Control of Phytophthora * Bacterial Canker and Leaf Scorch * Epidemiology and Control of Alternnaria * Honey Bee Management * Aluminum Phosphide Evaluation for Rodent Control
Work progressed on a number of research projects that will identify IPM strategies for various pests and other cultural practices in almonds.
Progress for each is described below.
* Biology and Ecology of San Jose Scale Parasitoids The parasitoids Encarsia perniciosi, Aphytis aonidiae and Aphytis vandenboschi were tested for ability to control SJS.
While A. vanderboschi effectively parasitized adult SJS, it did not survive the hot temperatures typical of Central Valley summers.
* Reducing the Impact of OP Dormant Sprays on Surface Water Dormant sprays using organophosphate insecticides are identified as contributing to pulses of pesticides found from winter storm runoff.
Run-off from orchards treated with an OP at different times during the dormant season was compared to determine if application timing affected the potential for run-off.
The data from a year where rainfall was uncharacteristically heavy early and light later in the winter still showed that the earlier application caused less run-off.
* Improving Naval Orange Worm Monitoring Efforts to determine the best location for NOW monitoring traps did not find any preferred tree location (height) for ovipositing eggs on developing nuts.
* Insect and Mite IPM Research
Supporting the UC Statewide IPM Program through this funding is important to the almond industry for decreasing dependence on higher risk pesticides.
Field trial research emphasizes refinement of pest monitoring and trapping.
In 2000, progress was made in understanding the relationship between the number of SJS crawlers captured on sticky tape and the infestation level.
In addition, it was determined that fungicides may impact predator mites.
The impact of newer miticides on predator mites showed that propargite (Omite) is still the miticide with the least impact on predatory mites.
* Ant Management in Almond Ants continue to be an increasingly destructive pest in almonds.
The Board sponsored two projects on the biology of the insect and on control measures.
This research created important efficacy data for new chemistry vs. conventional control measures and facilitated registration of Abamectin, a new control product.
Research sponsored by the Board also improved efficacy of ant bait stations.
* Almond Culture and Orchard Management A key component of the Board's extensive variety development involves selective breeding of new varieties for pest and disease resistance.
The orchard management emphasis on IPM involves continual innovations in IPM. * Nickels Soil Lab Projects The Nickels Lab provides trees and orchards for field trials of various almond culture and IPM studies.
In addition, research plots are dedicated to evaluating different types of irrigation systems, pruning trials, and soil types.
Minimal pruning provides excellent tree growth in some varieties of almond, with great cost savings.
The type and density of micro, drip and subsurface drip systems do impact yield and disease incidence.
* Epidemiology and Management of Almond Diseases The Board's extensive disease research program continues to make progress toward better understanding the variables affecting alternaria, anthracnose, brown rot, silver leaf, lethal canker, bacterial canker and other diseases.
Climatic conditions conducive to brown rot development were monitored to assist in the development of a predictive model.
An alternaria predictive model based on wetness and temperature parameters is looking promising.
* Biology and Control of Phytophthora Research into finding alternatives to methyl bromide treatments was initiated.
* Bacterial Canker and Leaf Scorch Varietal differences in susceptibility to leaf scorch were determined.
* Honey Bee Management Over one million hives are required to pollinate the almond crop.
Board-sponsored research is assisting in the progress of developing healthy breeding stock and refining IPM methods for controlling bee mites and diseases.
Results from CDPR Pesticide Use Reporting California's Department of Pesticide Regulation released a report on October 16, 2002 detailing a third consecutive year of reduction in pesticide use statewide.
The report highlights almonds as one of the crops having significantly reduced pesticide use, with a decrease of more than 1.5 million pounds from 2000-2001.
In terms of pounds applied of particular chemical compounds to the almond crop, the following changes have occurred between 1999 and 2001: azinphos methyl use decreased 17%; chlorpyrifos use decreased 20%; diazinon use decreased 49%; esfenvalerate use decreased 4%; methidathion use decreased 57%; permethrin use increased 10%; phosmet use decreased 29%; and propargite use decreased 2%.
During this time almond acreage increased in California.

Progress on 2000 Activity 2
The Almond Board is a partner with the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, Pest Management Alliance Program (PMA).
The Almond Board recently received its third year of funding from PMA, which includes a $1 00,000 per year grant for comparing conventional and reduced risk orchard management systems on demonstration plots located in commercial almond orchards.
These plots are located in three regions of the state, representing the variable growing conditions and pests of each area.
An important aspect of the PMA is the grower-to-grower communication and outreach efforts associated with the project.
A total of 6 PMA field days are scheduled for 2000-2001.
The PMA plots also exhibit a proven IPM strategy for two major pests of the crop, the navel orange worm (NOW) and the peach twig borer (PTB).
This "Four Point Program for Navel Orange worm Control," developed by the University of California, is a program that relies on orchard sanitation during the dormant season to decrease overwintering "mummy" nuts and thereby decreasing overwintering larvae.
This practice alone can reduce in-season worm damage by 50-60%.
a.
Grower participation at PMA meetings The PMA project has held 6 field days each year, 2 at each almond orchard participating in the program.
Stanislaus held a winter meeting Nov 28, 2001 that was attended by 130 growers and PCA's.
Butte County's January 11, 2002 meeting drew about 80 attendees.
Additional field days were held in May 2002 at each of the field sites.
Attendance has been increasing as the years in the PMA program have continued.
b. Encourage grower participation at the almond conference.
Education, outreach and the extension of information are the basis for California almond growers to gain confidence in reduced risk practices.
Efforts were made to increase grower attendance and participation at the annual conference.
This resulted in attendance of 720 individuals at the conference.
c. Increase Dissemination of Almond Board MaterialsAlmond Board Publications - IPM information was communicated through various Almond Board publications including:
* 2001 and 2002 Proceedings of the annual Almond Industry Conference; 700 copies each.
* Years of Discovery, a compilation of Board-sponsored research from 1972-present; 100 copies.
* Almond Almanac, annual summary of almond research and marketing information, 800 copies.
* Pest Management Alliance Newsletter - published two times during the year.
Featured results of the PMA demonstration plots, including IPM projects; 6,000 copies.
Now on available on the website http://www.lookercomm.com/AlmondPMA/Newsletter/Winter2003/pmanews.p df * Almond Board Newsletter - published several times a year to inform growers of ongoing issues and research results of interest.
* Almond Board Website - contains information on research, food safety, PMA newsletters, etc.
The Board also disseminated these materials through traditional channels, including farm advisor meetings, field days, conferences and other events.
__________________________________________________________________
Progress on 2000 Activity 3
An important channel for disseminating information to growers is through California's certified Pest Control Advisors (PCA).
A large percentage of growers use the services of PCAs when making decisions on pest control practices.
In 2000, the Almond Board began an outreach effort aimed at informing PCAs about Board-supported research and new developments on the reduced risk pest control practices.
Representatives of the Almond Board will make presentations at board meetings of regional chapters of CAPCA, the professional organization made up of PCAs.
An article will also be written for placement in Ag Advisor, the CAPCA membership publication.
Almond Board representatives will also make presentations at continuing education seminars sponsored by CAPCA.
The Board provided information materials as well as speaking about Board-funded IPM research at a number of farm advisor-sponsored meetings, grower field days and orchard tours meetings including the Kern, Butte, Stanislaus, and Merced County field days, six Pest Management Alliance field days (dormant and in-season field days for north, central and south state).
Attendance at field day meetings reflects the optimism and success of the PMA program.
Each region organizes at least two meetings per year.
One meeting is conducted in the spring and the other is a dormant/winter meeting.
Stanislaus held a winter meeting Nov. 28, 2001 that was attended by 130 growers and PCA's.
Butte County's dormant spray workshop was Jan. 11, 2002 and drew about 80 interested parties, and Kern County hosted a meeting in Bakersfield on Nov. 26, 2002.
Topics included: second and third year results of the Almond Pest Management Alliance demonstration plots; activities of the Board's Environmental Task Force; FQPA reregistration of organophosphates; mitigating dormant spray runoff; and protection of ground water.
An article in Western Fruit Grower Magazine in November 2001 explains the reduced risk approach to growing almonds results in a high quality crop, but that the softer products are still often more expensive than conventional pesticides.
An article in Ag Alert, the California Farm Bureau's newsletter, June 26, 2002 includes information from Rich Coviello's ant control presentation at the Modesto Field Day on May 2, 2002.
An article in the August California Farmer highlighted dormant season pesticide runoff problems and the educational effort aimed at reducing this type of environmental contamination.
The Spring 2002 Almond PMA Newsletter was sent to 6,500 growers, PCA's and other interested parties.
It contained updates on the regional projects and was also posted to the Almond PMA website.
At the annual research conference 184 persons signed up for continuing education credits to maintain the PCA, PA or CCA licenses.

Progress on 2000 Activity 4
The Almond Industry will continue to promote in 2000 in its publications and seminars the UC Statewide IPM program's "On-Line Calculator."
This Internet-based website provides growers and consultants a means to evaluate the economics of alternatives to conventional organophosphate sprays.
The Board dedicated the majority of its Spring 1999 newsletter to this on-line tool and will continue to supply reprints of this newsletter at grower meetings and other events.
Availability and promotion of the calculator will also occur at almond industry continued education and outreach activities; the Almond Board 2-day annual research conference highlighting the latest in Almond Board-sponsored research; periodic field days; on the Board web site; through web links to UC IPM, BIOS, etc.; and in newsletters and related publications.
The University of California's "On-Line Calculator" is available at the UC-IPM website since 2001.
The Almond Board has promoted its use through its publications and seminars.
__________________________________________________________________
Progress on 2000 Activity 5
The Almond Board will continue to distribute and publicize two important documents that describe reduced risk pest control practices: * USDA Crop Profile on almonds and USDA Pest Management Strategic Plan.
The Crop Profile, complete in 1998-99, is a comprehensive guide to the major pests and diseases of almonds and management practices currently employed to treat the pests and diseases.
* Pest Management Strategic Plan (PMSP) was developed in 1999-2000 by the almond industry and led by the Board, in conjunction with USDA.
The plan was developed specifically to document the next steps in transitioning away from high risk compounds.
The steps are covered on a pest-by-pest, compound-by-compound, and region-by-region basis.
The document identifies and evaluates reduced risk compounds.
This document is being used by EPA to assess the status and use of compounds employed in the almond industry.
It also provides growers and PCAs a comprehensive guide to the advantages and disadvantages of alternative compounds.
On December 12, 2002 a meeting was held to revise and expand the Pest Management Strategic Plan.
The meeting included growers, PCAs, researchers, and others.
The Pest Management Strategic Plan should be finalized by June 2003.
The Crop Profile and PMSP have been invaluable in answering questions from regulators on current pest control practices and needs.
They have helped to guide the Almond Board's decisions on research to request and fund.
The discussions have also aided the Board in contacting registrants and IR-4 to request research or tolerance development for promising reduced-risk compounds.

Progress on 2000 Activity 6
The Almond Board of California has increased participation in various activities including: an effort to expand intra industry involvement in environmental issues; building alliances with grower, academic and government agencies; and participating committees involved with exotic pests, diseases, and environmental Protection.
* The Almond Board Environmental Task Force (ETF) addresses current and environmental issues facing the almond industry.
The task force, which meets quarterly, is made up of almond growers and handlers who direct and advise the Board on issues such as: the Food Quality Protection Act; reregistration of pesticides; and air and water quality.
* The Methyl Bromide Alternatives Workgroup which Board staff is involved in is a consortium of agricultural representatives.
This workgroup involves a review of current research in methyl bromide alternatives and a discussion of directions for new research activities.
This workgroup is the key California conference on methyl bromide alternatives activities.
* The Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter/Pierce's Disease Task Force was appointed by the California Department of pesticide Regulation to address the immediate threat to agriculture and spread of Glassy-winged Sharpshooter and the vectoring of Pierce's Disease and Almond Leaf Scorch.
Board staff is involved in this task force to insure Board research adequately addresses the factors that relate directly to the almond industry.
Research will determine the relative susceptibility of the disease to almonds and varieties of almonds.
* The Ag Practices workgroup of the Sacrarnento/Feather River Watershed Program is working to identify farm practices that can protect northern California rivers from organophosphate insecticide runoff from farming operations, including almond orchards.
Partnership Activities The Almond Board is participating in several partnerships with governmental and academic institutions to improve communication and understanding of environmental issues.
These programs include: * US-EPA: Partners in Environmental Stewardship Program * California Department of Pesticide Regulation: Pest Management Alliance * USDA - ARS, Pest Management Strategic Plans describe the steps to decrease dependence on organophosphate and carbamate insecticides by specific pest, compound, and region.
EPA relies on this document to assess the status and use of pest control compounds applied to control almond pests.
The document also describes the status of reduced risk compounds in development by the pesticide industry * USDA - ARS, Crop Profile is a comprehensive guide to the major pests and diseases of almonds and management practices currently used by farmers to treat pests and diseases.
This document informs regulators about the use of various compounds by the almond industry as well as providing growers a comprehensive guide to the advantages and disadvantages of alternative compounds.
* University of California Statewide IPM program is a key program to improve utilization of reduced risk compounds * Almond Hullers and Processors (AH
AH
* The California Association of Pest Control Advisors (CAPCA) alliance allows the Board to target outreach activities to professionals who help growers make pest management decisions in the orchard.
* Community Alliance of Family Farmers (CAFF) partners with the Board in the Pest Management Alliance program.
CAFF involvement is important in representation of the segment of the industry actively pursuing reduced risk techniques.
The CAFF partnership also enhances the Board's ability to perform outreach activities.
* Commodity groups - the Almond Board actively involves other commodity groups in research, FQPA, environmental and water issues that are common to a number of different commodity groups.
The Nut Consortium, in particular, is seeking to address common issues jointly.
* Pesticide Registrants - the Board meets on a regular basis with representatives from the pesticide registrant community to keep abreast of pipeline products consistent with the Almond Pest Management Strategic Plan.
The California Almond Board has continued to be involved in numerous task forces, working groups and alliances with regard to pesticide and environmental issues.
These efforts have helped to focus research and education efforts to minimize the impact of pesticides (see 1 and 2 above).
They have also helped the industry understand emerging issues.
In response to the increased focus on environmental impacts of pesticides the Almond Board has listed "pro-actively seeking solutions to environmental challenges" as one of the 4 top priorities for the Board.
The Environmental Committee (formerly the Environmental Task Force) membership has increased from 5-7, research funding for environmental issues was separated out from the production research budget and now stands at $255,000.
See 3 for dissemination of information to almond growers and handlers on environmental issues.
__________________________________________________________________
Progress on 2000 Activity 7
Board staff has been instrumental in developing a comprehensive grower survey in cooperation with UC Statewide IPM Program.
The survey of almond growers is being conducted statewide in summer 2000 to assess growing practices and adoption of IPM techniques.
No report.

Activities for the Coming Year __________________________________________________________________
Activity 1
More than $700,000 will be spent in 2002-2003 on new and continuing research and development of IPM techniques that will enable growers to reduce their reliance on higher risk pesticides.
More than 50% of this funding is for projects directly related to our extensive IPM program and making progress toward developing and implementing IPM strategies.
The projects funded for 2002-2003 include: * Mating Disruption for Navel Orangeworm * Role of Natural Enemies for Leafroller and Leaffooted Bugs * Xylella Fastidiosa from Neighboring Vegetation * Biology and Management of Ten Lined June Beetle * Attractants for Ten-Lined June Beetle * Insect and Mite IPM Research * Field Evaluation of Almond Rootstocks * Almond Culture and Orchard Management * Nickels Soil Lab Projects * Control of Alternaria Leaf Spot * Epidemiology and Management of Anthracnose and Brown Rot * Epidemiology and Management of Silver Leaf * Replant Disease and Lethal Phytophthora Canker * Chemical and Cultural Control of Band Canker * Tree Architecture impact on Alternaria Leaf Spot * Fire Ant Monitoring Device * Study of Eastern Fox Squirrels in Orchards * Spray Swath Analysis for Drift Management * Reducing Impact of Dormant Sprays
How does this activity reduce pesticide risk?
Research into these insect, disease, and rodent pests of almonds provides the foundation for practices that will facilitate use of reduced risk pesticides where appropriate.
These studies increase knowledge for growers and consultants of the almond production system, pest biology, pest monitoring, and the development of resistant varieties.
The study of alternative methods for application or mitigation of pesticide applications will assist in development of methods to reduce the impact of pesticides on the environment.
Results of solid, reliable research gives growers more confidence in adopting new practices for controlling pests, including IPM and reduced risk pesticides.
How will you measure the risk reduction gained from this activity?
Risk reduction from adopting IPM and other practices can be measured by analyzing pesticide use reports from the Department of Pesticide Regulation and comparing current and past use of traditional control product usage with alternative practices, once those practices are refined and adopted by growers.
__________________________________________________________________
Activity 2
The Almond Pest Management Alliance's objectives are to focus on pest management solutions that reduce organophosphate and carbamate pesticides risk to human health and the environment.
These management and demonstration practices demonstrated at the field sites and educational events are specifically designed to enable growers to reduce or eliminate use of organophosphate dormant sprays such as diazinon, and herbicides such as simazine.
The Almond Board is providing funding to the project as well as staff time to manage it.
Specific goals include the outreach and education of growers as the effectiveness of reduced-risk pest management strategies.
Several field days are held each year to allow growers to learn on site about successful management techniques.
Outreach through media read by growers and specific material developed to help growers use new pest management techniques.
How does this activity reduce pesticide risk?
These field days give growers the opportunity to see firsthand and under local conditions how low risk practices can be used in almond production.
As a result of these types of field days over the past 5-6 years, almond growers have reduced their organophosphate (OP) use to where less than 40% now rely on these sprays for insect control.
How will you measure the risk reduction gained from this activity?
Track the number of growers attending the PMA meetings __________________________________________________________________
Activity 3
The Almond PMA project also addresses surface water contamination by helping to reduce dormant spray pesticides in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Watersheds.
Cover crop demonstrations are monitored specifically to reduce herbicide run-off into the waterways.
How does this activity reduce pesticide risk?
Techniques to minimize the run-off of pesticides into surface waters, such as cover crops, border strips, etc., will reduce the impact of pesticides on aquatic species.
How will you measure the risk reduction gained from this activity?
Monitor the levels of pesticides in the run-off from different treatments.
__________________________________________________________________
Activity 4
An important channel for disseminating information to growers is through California's certified Pest Control Advisors (PCA).
A large percentage of growers use the services of PCAs when making decisions on pest control practices.
In 2000, the Almond Board began an outreach effort aimed at informing PCAs about Board-supported research and new developments on the reduced risk pest control practices.
Representatives of the Almond Board will make presentations at board meetings of regional chapters of CAPCA, the professional organization made up of PCAs.
An article will also be written for placement in Ag Advisor, the CAPCA membership publication.
The Almond Board is also ensuring that attendance at the annual research meeting and their field days can be counted toward the necessary continuing education hours PCA must achieve each year.
How does this activity reduce pesticide risk?
This effort with PCAs will help disseminate information on low risk pest control practices to these key influencers of farmers.
In many cases, farmers will not try a new practice unless their PCA is knowledgeable and endorses the new practice.
Educational outreach continues by giving PCA, OA or CCA education credits for attending meetings.
How will you measure the risk reduction gained from this activity?
Continue monitoring adoption of low risk pest control practices through records provided by the Department of Pesticide Regulation.
__________________________________________________________________
Activity 5
Pest Management Strategic Plan (PMSP) was developed in 1999-2000 by the almond industry and led by the Board, in conjunction with USDA.
In December 2002, a meeting with growers, PCAs, researchers and others was held to update the Pest Management Strategic Plan.
The plan was expanded to include diseases, mammals, and weed control issues.
In addition, strategic issues were updated.
The plan was developed specifically to document the next steps in transitioning away from high-risk compounds.
The steps are covered on a pest-by-pest, compound-by-compound, and region-by-region basis.
The document identifies and evaluates reduced risk compounds.
This document is being used by EPA to assess the status and use of compounds employed in the almond industry.
It also provides growers and PCAs a comprehensive guide to the advantages and disadvantages of alternative compounds.
How does this activity reduce pesticide risk?
The plan does not reduce risk but can assist in dissemination reliable information about pest control and IPM techniques.
It also assists in determining research needs and registration needs to allow the use of reduced risk materials or methods.
How will you measure the risk reduction gained from this activity?
Monitor the use of the document by government officials.
Monitor the implementation of needs identified through the document development process.
