An electronic device comprising:
a display unit for displaying video data which is input through an image input unit;
a coordinate input unit for inputting hand-written data to said display unit,
wherein said display unit and said coordinate input unit are integrated;
a common frame memory which stores the video data input from the image input unit and the handwritten data input from said coordinate input unit;
a memory interface which controls timings of reading and writing of the video data and the handwritten data for said common frame memory; and
a processor which writes the video data and the handwritten data read from said common frame memory through said memory interface, synthesizes the written video data and the handwritten data, reads the synthesized video data and handwritten data as display data, and outputs the read display data to said display unit,
wherein said common frame memory, said memory interface and said processor are formed on a single semiconductor substrate.
