Polished smooth and battered by decades of harbor currents, luminescent fragments of 19th-century pottery and glassware belie their origin on Spectacle Island, once a city landfill for the burgeoning metropolis of Boston.
On Spectacle Island, both trash and treasures tell the isle's tale.
Debris from a midden (an archeological trash pile) on Spectacle Island reveals artifacts and food refuse discarded over a period of approximately 1,000 years by native people from the mainland who visited the island to fish and gather clams or other food.
By 1620, European sailors and settlers had introduced diseases that practically destroyed the native population.
English colonists named the island for its resemblance to a pair of eyeglasses and harvested firewood from the site.
Later, entrepreneurs from Boston established out-of-the-way businesses ranging from hotels and gambling dens to garbage dumps and a horse-rendering plant.
One of 30 islands that comprise Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area, 105-acre Spectacle Island has been transformed from an eyesore to a vision of reclamation and resource protection.
Recently, long-neglected Boston Harbor received acclaim for an unprecedented cleanup operation that has reversed the effects of centuries of watershed degradation and pollution in Massachusetts Bay.
Spectacle Island was identified in 1978 as a site for the deposit of more than three million cubic yards of excavated soil and materials from the Central Artery/Tunnel project, otherwise known as the "Big Dig."
A dike was built to contain the island's mountain of trash and prevent erosion.
Dirt and gravel transported by barge were used to reshape the island, which was capped with 18 inches of clay.
Two to five feet of topsoil over the cap has allowed for revegetation with plants and trees, setting the scene for a future recreational destination that includes water transportation, hiking trails, and a visitor center for the entire 50-square-mile national park area.
Spectacle Island has become part of the mission to protect Boston Harbor Islands historical, ecological, and recreational resources and make the island system an integral part of the life of the surrounding communities and region.
Managed by a dedicated partnership of current managers and owners including the National Park Service, Spectacle and its neighboring islands now offer a wealth of knowledge and access for education and enjoyment.
