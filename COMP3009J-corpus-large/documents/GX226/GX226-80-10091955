Acid deposition A complex chemical and atmospheric process whereby recombined emissions of sulfur and nitrogen compounds are redeposited on earth in wet or dry form.
See acid rain.
Acid rain Rainwater that has an acidity content greater than the postulated natural pH of about 5.6.
It is formed when sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides, as gases or fine particles in the atmosphere, combine with water vapor and precipitate as sulfuric acid or nitric acid in rain, snow, or fog.
The dry forms are acidic gases or particulates.
See acid deposition, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides.
Acid Solution Any water solution that has more hydrogen ions (H+) than hydroxide ions (OH-); any water solution with a pH less than 7.
See basic solution.
Acidic See acid solution.
Adiabatic Process A thermodynamic change of state of a system such that no heat or mass is transferred across the boundaries of the system.
In an adiabatic process, expansion always results in cooling, and compression in warming.
Aerobic A life or process that occurs in and is dependent upon oxygen.
See methanotrophic, anaerobic.
Aerosol Particulate matter, solid or liquid, larger than a molecule but small enough to remain suspended in the atmosphere.
Natural sources include salt particles from sea spray, dust and clay particles as a result of weathering of rocks, both of which are carried upward by the wind.
Aerosols can also originate as a result of human activities and are often considered pollutants.
Aerosols are important in the atmosphere as nuclei for the condensation of water droplets and ice crystals, as participants in various chemical cycles, and as absorbers and scatters of solar radiation, thereby influencing the radiation budget of the Earth's climate system.
See climate, particulate matter, sulfate aerosols.
Afforestations Planting of new forests on lands that have not been recently forested.
Air carrier An operator (e.g., airline) in the commercial system of air transportation consisting of aircraft that hold certificates of, Public Convenience and Necessity, issued by the Department of Transportation, to conduct scheduled or non-scheduled flights within the country or abroad.

Such chemicals or physical conditions (such as excess heat or noise) are called air pollutants.
Albedo The fraction of the total solar radiation incident on a body that is reflected by it.
Albedo can be expressed as either a percentage or a fraction of 1.
Snow covered areas have a high albedo (up to about 0.9 or 90%) due to their white color, while vegetation has a low albedo (generally about 0.1 or 10%) due to the dark color and light absorbed for photosynthesis.
Clouds have an intermediate albedo and are the most important contributor to the Earth's albedo.
The Earth's aggregate albedo is approximately 0.3.
See radiation, radiative forcing, photosynthesis.

Atmosphere The mixture of gases surrounding the Earth.
The Earth's atmosphere consists of about 79.1% nitrogen (by volume), 20.9% oxygen, 0.036% carbon dioxide and trace amounts of other gases.
The atmosphere can be divided into a number of layers according to its mixing or chemical characteristics, generally determined by its thermal properties (temperature).
The layer nearest the Earth is the troposphere, which reaches up to an altitude of about 8 km (about 5 miles) in the polar regions and up to 17 km (nearly 11 miles) above the equator.
The stratosphere, which reaches to an altitude of about 50 km (31 miles) lies atop the troposphere.
The mesosphere which extends up to 80-90 km is atop the stratosphere, and finally, the thermosphere, or ionosphere, gradually diminishes and forms a fuzzy border with outer space.
There is relatively little mixing of gases between layers.
Atmospheric lifetime See lifetime.

Under the Framework Convention, developed countries pledged to take measures aimed at returning their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The Berlin Mandate establishes a process that would enable the Parties to take appropriate action for the period beyond 2000, including a strengthening of developed country commitments, through the adoption of a protocol or other legal instruments.
See United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Conference of the Parties.

Also, materials that are biological in origin, including organic material (both living and dead) from above and below ground, for example, trees, crops, grasses, tree litter, roots, and animals and animal waste.
Biomass energy Energy produced by combusting biomass materials such as wood.
The carbon dioxide emitted from burning biomass will not increase total atmospheric carbon dioxide if this consumption is done on a sustainable basis (i.e., if in a given period of time, regrowth of biomass takes up as much carbon dioxide as is released from biomass combustion).
Biomass energy is often suggested as a replacement for fossil fuel combustion.
See biomass.

C Carbon black An amorphous form of carbon, produced commercially by thermal or oxidative decomposition of hydrocarbons and used principally in rubber goods, pigments, and printer's ink.
Carbon cycle All carbon reservoirs and exchanges of carbon from reservoir to reservoir by various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes.
Usually thought of as a series of the four main reservoirs of carbon interconnected by pathways of exchange.
The four reservoirs, regions of the Earth in which carbon behaves in a systematic manner, are the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere (usually includes freshwater systems), oceans, and sediments (includes fossil fuels).
Each of these global reservoirs may be subdivided into smaller pools, ranging in size from individual communities or ecosystems to the total of all living organisms (biota).
Carbon dioxide A colorless, odorless, non-poisonous gas that is a normal part of the ambient air.
Carbon dioxide is a product of fossil fuel combustion.
Although carbon dioxide does not directly impair human health, it is a greenhouse gas that traps terrestrial (i.e., infrared) radiation and contributes to the potential for global warming.
See global warming.
Carbon dioxide equivalent A metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential (GWP).
Carbon dioxide equivalents are commonly expressed as "million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MMTCDE)."
The carbon dioxide equivalent for a gas is derived by multiplying the tons of the gas by the associated GWP.
MMTCDE = (million metric tons of a gas) * (GWP of the gas) See greenhouse gas, global warming potential, carbon equivalent.
Carbon Equivalent A metric measure used to compare the emissions of different greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential (GWP).
Greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. are most commonly expressed as "million metric tons of carbon equivalents" (MMTCE).
Global warming potentials are used to convert greenhouse gases to carbon dioxide equivalents - they can be converted to carbon equivalents by multiplying by 12/44 (the ratio of the molecular weight of carbon to carbon dioxide).
The forumula for carbon equivalents is:
MMTCE = (million metric tons of a gas) * (GWP of the gas) * (12/44) See greenhouse gas, global warming potential, metric ton, carbon dioxide equivalent.
Carbon intensity The relative amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy or fuels consumed.
See energy, energy-efficiency.
Carbon pool The reservoir containing carbon as a principal element in the geochemical cycle.

Fossil fuels were at one time biomass and continue to store the carbon until burned.
See carbon sinks, fossil fuel.
Carbon sinks Carbon reservoirs and conditions that take-in and store more carbon (i.e., carbon sequestration) than they release.
Carbon sinks can serve to partially offset greenhouse gas emissions.
Forests and oceans are large carbon sinks.
See carbon sequestration.
Carbon tetrachloride A compound consisting of one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms.

Solvent use was ended in the United States when it was discovered to be carcinogenic.
See ozone depleting substance.
Chemical reaction Interaction between chemicals in which there is a change in the chemical composition of the elements or compounds involved.
Chlorofluorocarbons Organic compounds made up of atoms of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine.
An example is CFC-12 (CCl2F2, used as a refrigerant in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a foam blowing agent.
Gaseous CFCs can deplete the ozone layer when they slowly rise into the stratosphere, are broken down by strong ultraviolet radiation, release chlorine atoms, and then react with ozone molecules.
See ozone depleting substance, fluorocarbons.
Climate The average weather, usually taken over a 30 year time period, for a particular region and time period.
Climate is not the same as weather, but rather, it is the average pattern of weather for a particular region.
Weather describes the short-term state of the atmosphere.
Climatic elements include precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind velocity, phenomena such as fog, frost, and hail-storms, and other measures of the weather.
See weather.
Climate change The term "climate change" is sometimes used to refer to all forms of climatic inconsistency, but because the Earth's climate is never static, the term is more properly used to imply a significant change from one climatic condition to another.
In some cases, climate change has been used synonymously with the term, global warming; scientists however, tend to use the term in the wider sense to also include natural changes in climate.
See climate, global warming, greenhouse effect, enhanced greenhouse effect, radiative forcing.
Climate feedback An atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, or other process that is activated by direct climate change induced by changes in radiative forcing.
Climate feedbacks may increase (positive feedback) or diminish (negative feedback) the magnitude of the direct climate change.
See climate, climate change, radiative forcing.
Climate lag The delay that occurs in climate change as a result of some factor that changes only very slowly.
For example, the effects of releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere may not be known for some time because a large fraction is dissolved in the ocean and only released to the atmosphere many years later.
See climate, climate change.
Climate model A quantitative way of representing the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.
Models can range from relatively simple to quite comprehensive.
See General Circulation Model.

Coal A black or brownish black solid, combustible substance formed by the partial decomposition of vegetable matter without access to air.
The rank of coal, which includes anthracite, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, and lignite, is based on fixed carbon, volatile matter, and heating value.
Coal rank indicates the progressive alteration, or coalification, from lignite to anthracite.
See anthracite, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, lignite.
Coal coke A hard, porous product made from baking bituminous coal in ovens at temperatures as high as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
It is used both as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.
Coal gasification Conversion of solid coal to synthetic natural gas (SNG) or a gaseous mixture that can be burned as a fuel.
Coal liquefaction Conversion of solid coal to a liquid fuel such as synthetic crude oil or methanol.
Coalbed methane Methane that is produced from coalbeds in the same manner as natural gas produced from other strata.
Methane is the principal component of natural gas.
Co-control benefit The additional benefit derived from an environmental policy that is designed to control one type of pollution, while reducing the emissions of other pollutants as well.
For example, a policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions might reduce the combustion of coal, but when coal combustion is reduced, so too are the emissions of particulates and sulfur dioxide.
The benefits associated with reductions in emissions of particulates and sulfur dioxide are the co-control benefits of reductions in carbon dioxide.
Cogeneration Production of two useful forms of energy such as high-temperature heat and electricity from the same process.
For example, while boiling water to generate electricity, the leftover steam can be sold for industrial processes or space heating.
Combustion Chemical oxidation accompanied by the generation of light and heat.

Decomposition The breakdown of matter by bacteria and fungi.
It changes the chemical composition and physical appearance of the materials.
See composting.
Deforestation Those practices or processes that result in the change of forested lands to non-forest uses.
This is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect for two reasons: 1) the burning or decomposition of the wood releases carbon dioxide; and 2) trees that once removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis are no longer present and contributing to carbon storage.
Degradable See biodegradable.
Desertification The progressive destruction or degradation of existing vegetative cover to form desert.
This can occur due to overgrazing, deforestation, drought, and the burning of extensive areas.
Once formed, deserts can only support a sparse range of vegetation.
Climatic effects associated with this phenomenon include increased albedo, reduced atmospheric humidity, and greater atmospheric dust (aerosol) loading.
Distillate fuel oil A general classification for the petroleum fractions produced in conventional distillation operations.
Included are products known as No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 fuel oils and No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 diesel fuels.

Electrons Tiny particle moving around outside the nucleus of an atom.
Each electron has one unit of negative charge (-) and almost no mass.
Element Chemicals such as hydrogen (H), iron (Fe), sodium (Na), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), or oxygen (O), whose distinctly different atoms serve as the basic building blocks of all matter.
There are 92 naturally occurring elements.
Another 15 have been made in laboratories.
Two or more elements combine to form compounds that make up most of the world's matter.
See compound.
El NiÃ±o A climatic phenomenon occurring irregularly, but generally every 3 to 5 years.
El NiÃ±os often first become evident during the Christmas season (El NiÃ±o means Christ child) in the surface oceans of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
The phenomenon involves seasonal changes in the direction of the tropical winds over the Pacific and abnormally warm surface ocean temperatures.
The changes in the tropics are most intense in the Pacific region, these changes can disrupt weather patterns throughout the tropics and can extend to higher latitudes, especially in Central and North America.
The relationship between these events and global weather patterns are currently the subject of much research in order to enhance prediction of seasonal to interannual fluctuations in the climate.
Emission inventory A list of air pollutants emitted into a community's, state's, nation's, or the Earth's atmosphere in amounts per some unit time (e.g. day or year) by type of source.
An emission inventory has both political and scientific applications.

Energy has several forms, some of which are easily convertible and can be changed to another form useful for work.
Most of the world's convertible energy comes from fossil fuels that are burned to produce heat that is then used as a transfer medium to mechanical or other means in order to accomplish tasks.
In the United States, electrical energy is often measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), while heat energy is often measured in British thermal units (Btu).
Energy-efficiency The ratio of the useful output of services from an article of industrial equipment to the energy use by such an article; for example, vehicle miles traveled per gallon of fuel (mpg).
Enhanced greenhouse effect The concept that the natural greenhouse effect has been enhanced by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.
Increased concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, CFCs, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3 and other photochemically important gases caused by human activities such as fossil fuel consumption, trap more infra-red radiation, thereby exerting a warming influence on the climate.

Global warming The progressive gradual rise of the earth's surface temperature thought to be caused by the greenhouse effect and responsible for changes in global climate patterns.
An increase in the near surface temperature of the Earth.
Global warming has occurred in the distant past as the result of natural influences, but the term is most often used to refer to the warming predicted to occur as a result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases.

Global Warming Potential (GWP) The index used to translate the level of emissions of various gases into a common measure in order to compare the relative radiative forcing of different gases without directly calculating the changes in atmospheric concentrations.
GWPs are calculated as the ratio of the radiative forcing that would result from the emissions of one kilogram of a greenhouse gas to that from emission of one kilogram of carbon dioxide over a period of time (usually 100 years).
The chart below shows the original GWPs (assigned in 1990) and the most recent GWPs (assigned in 1996) for the most important greenhouse gases.

Greenhouse effect The effect produced as greenhouse gases allow incoming solar radiation to pass through the Earth's atmosphere, but prevent part of the outgoing infrared radiation from the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere from escaping into outer space.
This process occurs naturally and has kept the Earth's temperature about 59 degrees F warmer than it would otherwise be.
Current life on Earth could not be sustained without the natural greenhouse effect.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) The IPCC was established jointly by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988.
The purpose of the IPCC is to assess information in the scientific and technical literature related to all significant components of the issue of climate change.
The IPCC draws upon hundreds of the world's expert scientists as authors and thousands as expert reviewers.
Leading experts on climate change and environmental, social, and economic sciences from some 60 nations have helped the IPCC to prepare periodic assessments of the scientific underpinnings for understanding global climate change and its consequences.
With its capacity for reporting on climate change, its consequences, and the viability of adaptation and mitigation measures, the IPCC is also looked to as the official advisory body to the world's governments on the state of the science of the climate change issue.
For example, the IPCC organized the development of internationally accepted methods for conducting national greenhouse gas emission inventories.

Lifetime (Atmospheric) The lifetime of a greenhouse gas refers to the approximate amount of time it would take for the anthropogenic increment to an atmospheric pollutant concentration to return to its natural level (assuming emissions cease) as a result of either being converted to another chemical compound or being taken out of the atmosphere via a sink.
This time depends on the pollutant's sources and sinks as well as its reactivity.
The lifetime of a pollutant is often considered in conjunction with the mixing of pollutants in the atmosphere; a long lifetime will allow the pollutant to mix throughout the atmosphere.
Average lifetimes can vary from about a week (sulfate aerosols) to more than a century (CFCs, carbon dioxide).

It can then be purified and upgraded to synthetic crude oil.
See bitumen.
Temperature Measure of the average speed of motion of the atoms or molecules in a substance or combination of substances at a given moment.
See heat.
Terrestrial Pertaining to land.
Terrestrial radiation The total infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere in the temperature range of approximately 200 to 300 Kelvin.
Terrestrial radiation provides a major part of the potential energy changes necessary to drive the atmospheric wind system and is responsible for maintaining the surface air temperature within limits of livability.
Trace Gas Any one of the less common gases found in the Earth's atmosphere.
Nitrogen, oxygen, and argon make up more than 99 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.
Other gases, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, oxides of nitrogen, ozone, and ammonia, are considered trace gases.
Although relatively unimportant in terms of their absolute volume, they have significant effects on the Earth's weather and climate.
Transportation sector Consists of private and public passenger and freight transportation, as well as government transportation, including military operations.
Troposphere The lowest layer of the atmosphere and contains about 95 percent of the mass of air in the Earth's atmosphere.
The troposphere extends from the Earth's surface up to about 10 to 15 kilometers.
All weather processes take place in the troposphere.
Ozone that is formed in the troposphere plays a significant role in both the greenhouse gas effect and urban smog.
See ozone precursors, stratosphere, atmosphere.
Tropospheric ozone (O3) See ozone.
Tropospheric ozone precursors See ozone precursors.

U Ultraviolet radiation (UV) A portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths shorted than visible light.
The sun produces UV, which is commonly split into three bands of decreasing wavelength.
Shorter wavelength radiation has a greater potential to cause biological damage on living organisms.
The longer wavelength ultraviolet band, UVA, is not absorbed by ozone in the atmosphere.
UVB is mostly absorbed by ozone, although some reaches the Earth.
The shortest wavelength band, UVC, is completely absorbed by ozone and normal oxygen in the atmosphere.
Unfinished oils All oils requiring further refinery processing, except those requiring only mechanical blending.
Includes naphtha and lighter oils, kerosene and light gas oils, heavy gas oils, and residuum.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) The international treaty unveiled at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in June 1992.
The UNFCCC commits signatory countries to stabilize anthropogenic (i.e. human-induced) greenhouse gas emissions to 
Out of 155 countries that have ratified this accord, the United States was the first industrialized nation to do so.
See Conference of the Parties, Berlin Mandate, Kyoto Protocol, Montreal Protocol.

V Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) One vehicle traveling the distance of one mile.
Thus, total vehicle miles is the total mileage traveled by all vehicles.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) Organic compounds that evaporate readily into the atmosphere at normal temperatures.
VOCs contribute significantly to photochemical smog production and certain health problems.
See non-methane volatile organic compounds.

W Wastewater Water that has been used and contains dissolved or suspended waste materials.
See sewage treatment.
Water Vapor The most abundant greenhouse gas; it is the water present in the atmosphere in gaseous form.
Water vapor is an important part of the natural greenhouse effect.
While humans are not significantly increasing its concentration, it contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect because the warming influence of greenhouse gases leads to a positive water vapor feedback.
In addition to its role as a natural greenhouse gas, water vapor plays an important role in regulating the temperature of the planet because clouds form when excess water vapor in the atmosphere condenses to form ice and water droplets and precipitation.
See greenhouse gas.
Waxes Solid or semisolid materials derived from petroleum distillates or residues.
Light-colored, more or less translucent crystalline masses, slightly greasy to the touch, consisting of a mixture of solid hydrocarbons in which the paraffin series predominates.
Included are all marketable waxes, whether crude scale or fully refined.
Used primarily as industrial coating for surface protection.
Weather Weather is the specific condition of the atmosphere at a particular place and time.
It is measured in terms of such things as wind, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and precipitation.
In most places, weather can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season.
Climate is the average of weather over time and space.
A simple way of remembering the difference is that climate is what you expect (e.g. cold winters) and 'weather' is what you get (e.g. a blizzard).
See climate.
Wetland Land that stays flooded all or part of the year with fresh or salt water.
Wetlands Areas regularly saturated by surface or groundwater and subsequently characterized by a prevalence of vegetation adapted for life in saturated-soil conditions.
Wood energy Wood and wood products used as fuel, including roundwood (i.e., cordwood), limbwood, wood chips, bark, sawdust, forest residues, and charcoal.
