[dentalium.jpg] Mitochondrial Genomics We are targeting a large number (hundreds) of phylogenetically diverse animals for sequencing of complete mitochondrial genomes.
We are reconstructing evolutionary relationships from the deepest levels to the population level using both sequences and genome level characters (such as gene arrangements), and we are using this system for better understanding the processes of genome evolution.
Some projects are specifically addressing issues of biogeography and of conservation biology.
[chloroplast.jpg] Plastid Genomics We are determining more than 100 complete chloroplast genome sequences from phylogenetically diverse lineages.
We are using both gene arrangements and sequences to reconstruct evolutionary patterns and learning about the processes of genome evolution.

Organelle genomes of diatoms, oomycetes, basidiomycetes, Chlamydamonas, Phanerochaete, and poplar tree
The organelle genomes come "for free" when JGI sequences an entire nuclear genome, as in these cases.
[RCA_gel.jpg] Rolling circle amplification strategies for organellar genomes RCA is a new technique that can amplify essentially any DNA from picogram to microgram quantities overnight.
This enables complete organelle genome sequencing from miniscule quantities of pure DNA, making valuable a new range of enrichment techniques and facilitating study of small or rare organisms.
We have been experimenting with various approaches using RCA and have successfully amplified and sequenced both mtDNAs and cpDNAs. [one.jpg] Software for gene annotation of organellar genomes We have written highly interactive software (DOGMA) that facilitates the annotation of genes for mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes and for subsequent submission to GenBank. [tRNA.jpg]
We are working to place much of this in databases and to provide tools for browsing and comparing genome level information for organelle genomes. [vertebrate_tree.jpg] Characterizing the tempo and mode of gene duplication for vertebrates We have developed a novel method for clustering genes by family and have created phylogenetic trees for all homologous genes of Ciona, pufferfish, mouse, and human, sorting out paralogous and orthologous relationships.
We have used this data to make many inferences about the rate and nature of gene/gene segment/genome duplication across the vertebrates.
[P.sojae_canker.jpg] Comparing the whole genomes of two oomycetes, Phytophthora sojae (soybean pathogen) and P. ramorum (causative agent of sudden oak death syndrome) These two species have very different host specificity.
We are nearly finished determining the complete genome sequences of both, and are planning a set of comparisons for identifying the genomic correlates of the physiological (etc.) differences between these two water molds.
[P.pachyrhizi_infection.jpg] Comparing the whole genomes of two basidiomycetes, Phakopsora meibomiae and P. pachyrhizi Similarly, we will soon have available these two complete genome sequences.
P. pachyrhizi infects and kills soybeans, but P. meibomiae only infects without causing significant disease.
We hope to identify the genomic differences that are responsible for this. [cichlid.jpg] Hox clusters of a cichlid fish We have determined the complete sequence of one Hox gene cluster for a cichlid and hope to obtain the sequence for the rest.
Comparisons have identified many highly conserved regions likely to play important roles in regulation of this gene family.
[mite.jpg] Hox cluster of the mite Archegozetes This animal is a model for studies of evolution and development.
We have recently determined the complete sequence of this Hox cluster and are working on analysis of conserved regulatory regions.
These genes are serving as reagents to characterize gene expression patterns in developing mite embryos in order to assay homology to segmental patterns of other arthropods. [tuatara.jpg] Constructing BAC libraries and broad targeting of interesting genomic regions The limiting factor in broad phylogenetic surveys of interesting genomic regions is generally having the relevant clones in hand.
BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes) vectors are ideal for making whole genome libraries because a relatively small number of clones must be stored, probed, etc.
We are working to make BAC libraries for several major lineages and to make these reagents available to the scientific community.
[reef.jpg] Genome-enabled study of coral reef biology Reef building corals are key organisms in tropical marine benthic communities and coral health is highly dependant on the tight relationship they maintain with their dinoflagellate (zooxanthellae) symbionts.
Coral bleaching (loss of symbionts) is a widespread phenomenon known to be associated with sea temperature increases and/or elevated light levels, thus understanding the host-symbiont interactions becomes very important under the threat of global warming.
We are using a genome-wide strategy to try to identify genes and molecular processes involved in coral symbiosis by producing: 1) EST libraries from hosts and their symbionts, 2) microarrays to screen for potential symbiosis genes under different treatments in the field, 3) BAC libraries from which relevant clones will be sequenced to look at cis-regulation of symbiosis genes.
[stalk_eyed_fly.jpg] Genomics behind the evolution of stalk-eyed flies Sexual selection is responsible for much of the morphological diversity among animals.
This diversity is often expressed in the form of male ornamental display traits and these characters generally exhibit rapid rates of evolutionary change and abundant intraspecific genetic variation.
The eyestalks of stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae) provide one of the most dramatic examples of this type of exaggerated male character.
Despite the widespread study of sexually selected characters, few attempts have been made to identify variation at the molecular level associated with these ornamental traits.
We are currently using an integrative approach that combines EST libraries, microarray analysis, comparative genomics, phylogenetic reconstruction and QTL mapping to identify genes responsible for differences in eyespan in stalk-eyed flies and to examine the evolutionary dynamics of these genes.
This research will focus on molecular variation in both protein coding and regulatory DNA and address questions such as 1) How and where does the molecular variation associated with phenotypic diversity accumulate in the genome? 2) Is morphological convergence associated with molecular convergence? 3) Are signs of positive selection evident in DNA regions coding for rapidly divergent morphology?

Phylogeny and molecular evolution of prokaryotes A large number of complete genome sequences have recently become available that represent many evolutionary lineages of bacteria.
We are using large scale sequence comparisons to reconstruct these ancient evolutionary relationships.
Based on this phylogenetic framework, we are also studying the processes of genome evolution, unraveling correlations among molecular characters, such as genome size, base composition and rate of amino acid substitution.
By also analyzing how changes in the repertoire of DNA repair enzymes among different organisms correlate with the evolution of these molecular characters, we are attempting to understand the mechanistic basis of genome change.
