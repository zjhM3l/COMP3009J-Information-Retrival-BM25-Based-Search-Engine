A thousand years ago, the Chacoan people planned ceremonial events and agricultural planting according to celestial observations.
In this remote, northwest corner of New Mexico, Puebloan descendants continue many of these traditions under clear, dark skies, free from urban light pollution.
In 1993 Chaco Culture National Historical Park designated the night sky as a critical resource to be protected.
All park lighting has since been retrofitted to reduce light pollution and enhance night sky viewing.
In 1997 a partnership with The Albuquerque Astronomical Society attracted astronomer John Selfick to donate a domed observatory and equipment to the park.
Chaco's Night Sky Program is now a successful volunteer project that involves more than 13,000 park visitors each year.
