REGIONAL CQI TEAM MEETING 5/15/ 0 3 Attending: Kathy K., Kathy H., Malinda B.
The team did not review data as attendance was low and data was not forwarded for review.
It was noted that this meeting date continues to have very low attendance and that it is difficult to move the work forward with so few members.
1.
Yearly schedule of Leadership, Quality Assurance Committee and DAIT was noted.
Kathy Haven will adjust all future agendas so that we can forward quality reports to these teams.
2.
Customer Satisfaction data for phone customers.
The team brainstormed ideas for collecting data for this large number of customers.
It was noted that we have no current system to collect data to make system improvements for these customers.
It was also noted that the information thus far received from the Mystery Shopper Reports indicates this is an area that needs attention.
Following are ideas:
Ã˜ Set up our own mystery shopper internally.
Ã˜ Purchase additional shops from the present vendor.
Ã˜ Have "cue cards/scripts" for staff providing services over the phone (said my name, said customer's name, asked if all questions were answered, asked if person knows next steps, etc.).
Ã˜ Identify what kind of data we want from additional phone shops.
Ã˜ Check for trends when we receive the next Mystery Shopper report (should have 3 quarters worth).
Ã˜ Develop a cross-county, cross-agency team to develop cue cards/phone scripts.
