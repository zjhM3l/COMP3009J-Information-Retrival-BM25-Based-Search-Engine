House Committee on Small Business "The Offshoring of High Skilled Jobs" October 20, 2003 Prepared Remarks of Ms. Natasha Humphries, Santa Clara, CA
Mr. Chairman, and esteemed members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to hear my testimony today on behalf of myself as well as many other ex-Silicon Valley technical workers disenfranchised by the use of offshoring by Silicon Valley companies.
My name is Natasha D. Humphries.
Immediately following my undergraduate studies at Stanford University, School of Humanities in 1996, I developed an interest in computer software landing my first job at Apple Computer, Inc.
Over the years I have continued to acquire new skills through classes, seminars, and self-study in order to adapt to the face-paced technological changes in Silicon Valley.
As a Senior Software Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer, I have over seven years experience testing US and International software applications, most recently in the handlheld device industry.
After more than three years of service, I was laid off from Palm, Inc. at the end of August 2003 due to a workforce reduction or realignment.
Palm, Inc. is the leading global provider of handheld computing devices, and operating systems for handheld devices including both Palm branded and Palm OS powered devices.
According to Palm's Form 10-Q SEC filing, dated Oct. 14, 2003, Palm shipped over 22.9 million Palm Branded devices, and approximately 30.1 million Palm Powered devices had been sold worldwide as of August 31, 2003, resulting in total revenue of $871.9 million in fiscal year 2003.
Since the dot com bust a few years ago, Palm, as well as many other companies in Silicon Valley, has been struggling to reduce R
Early year 2002, Palm's software testing organization definitively began an aggressive campaign to outsource all testing assignments to India and China
.
After securing bids for pay rates as low as $2-5/hr or $4,200-$10,400 per year, executive management made the decision to outsource all testing assignments to Software QA Engineers in India, achieving considerable savings of 50-70% on salaries alone.
Pay rates of US workers range from $30-60/hr or $63,000-$125,000 per year.
In my role as Senior Software QA Engineer Lead, it was my responsibility to review product specifications, develop product test support documents and milestone schedules, set up/manage the software defect tracking system, report defect metrics and testing status to QA management and US-based cross-functional teams, and to manage the offshore test team.
My software project was one of the first to use the offshore team in India.
After several weeks of mounting project management difficulties including but not limited to language and geographical barriers, cultural differences, downed e-mail servers, weak network and telephone infrastructure, immature software development knowledge, lack of familiarity with (software and hardware) products and IT/Engineering systems, I and a number of my colleagues forecasted protracted development and testing cycles.
Management quickly identified a solution for the last three problems.
In order to build core competency of Palm's products, software development practices, and IT/Engineering systems, the Product Software Integration and Test (PSWIT) organization began sending in-house Software QA Engineers to train their counterparts in India from their Milpitas headquarters.
I was one of the designees, and trained Software QA Engineers in Bangalore, India for a period of two weeks in December 2002.
After six months, the major problems began to subside, and the offshore team were rapidly advancing up their learning curve.
Over a period of more than four months after returning from India, I met repeatedly with my Software QA manager and QA Director in order to ascertain the new direction of the organization and any new skill sets required to remain competitive in my position as the offshore team began performing more of my job functions.
I sought advice and approval for tuition-reimbursed course work in programming languages (e.g., Java and C++) and scripting languages for automation testing (e.g., Silk).
At each individual or organizational meeting, I was unable to learn any specific new requirements of my position, and was discouraged to enhance my professional skill set either through poor direction, or denied approval of coursework.
The QA Director always indicated that his organizational structure was in flux, and that his strategy to increase the QA group's technical expertise in alignment with new business objectives would be revealed soon.
Moreover, he assured the QA group that no one would lose their jobs to offshoring of work, although the majority current assignments were already being tested in India and China.
In March 2003, however, I learned that new automation testing assignments had recently been offshored to a different vendor in India.
Management quickly dismissed my job security concerns, stating that delegating the current job functions to the offshore team would provide more freedom to develop new technical skills.
The veracity of these statements were doubtful, and I suspected that I would be displaced by the offshore team, particularly after returning from a 10-day vacation in which my Lead counterpart in India directed the test effort in my absence without me having to work repometly while on vacation for the first time in three years.
In preparation for my vacation, I provided detailed instructions to the Lead in India defining how to report defect metrics for team status reporting, how to manually correct queries that failed, when to send the status report Monday mornings prior to executive program review and to which distribution lists.
When I returned from vacation in June.
I was astounded to learn that that my plan was flawlessly executed without a glitch.
I recognized immediately that my time horizon at Palm as a Sr. Software QA Engineer was shortening and that I may have engineered my way out of my job.
My suspicions were confirmed when management failed to conduct an annual performance review in July 2003.
On August 20, 2003, I was terminated from my position along with~ 40% (forty percent) of the software quality assurance group which represented fourteen people.
Although this number may not appear statistically significant, it is of import to note that we represented the talented few remaining after scores of layoffs over a three-year period following the dot com bust.
Most of the terminated QA individuals held senior positions and commanded a considerably higher annual salary in comparison to our offshore counterparts earning less than $5/hr.
Although most of the Software QA Engineers in India are Master's degree holders, Palm is only required to pay home country wages commensurate to living standards in India ($2-4/hr).
According to my termination letter, Palm made a determination that the software project to which I was assigned had reduced or eliminated investment in the company.
However, I have knowledge that the software project to which I was assigned is indeed in alignment with the company's business objectives, and further, represents a new platform on which development of all future software applications will be based.
I have also received confirmation from anonymous sources within the company that my offshore team in India continues to test following my departure from Palm.
Ironically, one of my peers in QA, who was also separated from Palm in August during the seventh month of her pregnancy is a US citizen from India, displaced by technical workers in her home country.
I learned recently from a former team member in the Customer Support organization that he received notice last week that his employment at Palm will terminate at the end of this month.
Although the notice indicated that the termination was due to the Handspring merger, he suspects the decision may be related to the recent outsourcing of Customer Support to India.
An anonymous source reports that additional layoffs are expected as Palm increase its "multisourcing" efforts to companies in India.
A month following my departure from Palm, I joined TechsUnite.org which is building an alliance of technical workers to raise public awareness and to protest offshoring, among other worker's rights issues.
During TechsUnite meetings, I have met many Software Engineers, and IT workers who have been unemployed or underemployed on average between 18 to 24 months.
Offshoring has created a devastating economic climate, not just among Silicon Valley technical workers, but throughout the US.
Although the public and media have recently faulted H1B and L1 guest worker visa programs for massive US job losses, companies have found a new back door, and are circumventing H-1B and L1 restrictions by directly off-shoring large volumes of work directly to companies in India.
Off-shoring will prolong the economic recovery period as the number of US jobs quickly diminish over time.
Rising unemployment numbers will further exacerbate local, state and federal budgetary deficits, since the taxable income base will be unemployment benefits until the benefit period (usually 1 yr) expires.
Congress will need to work quickly to revise current legislation and enact new legislation with incentives to maintain high tech jobs in the US and create disincentives for companies to offshore US high tech jobs.
