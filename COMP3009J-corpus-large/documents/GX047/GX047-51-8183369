President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright are determined to achieve this objective as soon as possible.

The recent fate of Pol Pot followed the precipitous collapse of the Khmer Rouge who defected in large number to the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and thus exposed Khmer Rouge leaders to possible capture.
We are disappointed that Pol Pot did not face a court of law.
But a number of top Khmer Rouge leaders remain at large.
As President Clinton said on April 16, "we must not permit the death of the most notorious of the Khmer Rouge leaders to deter us from the equally important task of bringing these others to justice."

They are a significant reason thousands of refugees, with all of their attendant requirements, flow across the border into Thailand.
Most importantly, the most senior living Khmer Rouge leaders who conceived, planned and directed the crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes against the people of Cambodia and others during April 1975 to January 1979 must be held accountable for these crimes to reaffirm our common faith in the rule of law and to end impunity for these crimes.

The United States is working within the Security Council to establish an international criminal tribunal for Cambodia with a mandate to investigate and prosecute senior Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes committed during the Pol Pot regime years of 1975 to 1979.
We are doing so in addition to our longstanding and continuous support for the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda.
We also are pleased that the U.S. funding for the Cambodia Genocide Project at Yale University, directed by Professor Ben Kiernan, and of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, ably administered by Youk Chhang, has proven instrumental in recording the crimes of the Pol Pot regime
.

We hope senior Khmer Rouge leaders realize that their personal safety and the opportunity to live out a natural life would be assured if an international criminal tribunal ultimately gains custody of them.
The United States will do what it can to facilitate that objective.

set forth by the UN General Assembly last year and being advanced by Ambassador Hammarberg, the UN Secretary General We have consulted with the director and staff of the UN Center for Human Rights in Phnom Penh, and
we look forward to further efforts to examine the facts and to pursue accountability in Cambodia for the crimes committed during the Pol Pot regime.
No one who tours Tuol Sleng prison, as I did on Monday, can forget the horror that consumed this country during the Pol Pot regime.
We all have a profound responsibility to the victims of that regime and to our commitment to the rule of law to vigorously pursue those most responsible for these heinous crimes, to ensure they receive fair trials, and to help build a democratic, prosperous and peaceful future for the people of Cambodia.
Thank you.
