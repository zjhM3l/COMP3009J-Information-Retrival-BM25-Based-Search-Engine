Department of Justice Seal FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NCATF THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1998 JUSTICE PUBLIC AFFAIRS (202) 616-2765 WWW.TREAS.ATF.GOV TREASURY PUBLIC AFFAIRS (202) 622-2960 WWW.USDOJ.GOV TTD (202) 514-1888 CHURCH ARSONS FALLING IN THE FACE OF INCREASED PROSECUTIONS WASHINGTON, D.C.
-- The National Church Arson Task Force issued its Second Year Report to the President today, detailing a string of prosecutions that contributed to curbing church arsons across America.
Federal officials believe that vigorous investigations and prosecutions played a role, along with increased vigilance, well publicized arrests and community prevention efforts in reducing the fires.
The Task Force has made arrests at a rate twice the national average for arson cases, and convicted 235 defendants in connection with 173 incidents.
"Two years ago, when President Clinton created the National Church Arson Task Force, the agents of ATF, the FBI and federal prosecutors committed to work with state and local authorities to investigate fires with vigor, integrity and compassion," said James E. Johnson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement.
"We have kept our commitment and will continue to be vigilant."
"Federal state and local law enforcement have come together as one to seek justice," said Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.
"We have had tremendous results, but we have much more to do."
The reports describes the accomplishments of the Task Force, including:
1.
opening 670 investigations into arsons, bombings or attempted bombings that have occurred at houses of worship since January 1, 1995, resulting in the arrest of 308 suspects in connection with 230 of these investigations; 2.
a 34 percent arrest rate in Task Force arson cases more than double the 16 percent arrest rate of arsons in general; and, 3.
convictions by federal, state and local prosecutors of 235 defendants in connection with 173 incidents since January 1995.
In order to ensure that these prosecutions remain a priority, the Task Force lodged the responsibility of federal prosecution in the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, the existing structure within the Justice Department that has jurisdiction over church arsons and other federal criminal civil rights cases.
U.S. Attorney's offices and state and local authorities will continue to investigate and prosecute arsons at houses of worship, drawing upon the resources of the Task Force's partners, including ATF and the FBI.
The Second Year Report is available through the Public Affairs Offices of the Department of Justice (202) 616-2765 or the Department of the Treasury at (202) 622-2960 or via the internet at www.atf.treas.gov.
