International Information Programs South Asia | Afghanistan 26 October 2001 Bill Introduced on Health, Education of Afghan Women, Kids Senate women submit S. 1573 to aid Afghan women, children The women of the U.S. Senate joined forces October 25 to submit a bill that would provide educational and health care assistance to the women and children of Afghanistan.
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson (Republican of Texas) introduced S. 1573, the Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001, to the Senate October 25.
The bill was co-sponsored by the Senate's 12 other female senators.
Senators Barbara Boxer (Democrat of California), Maria Cantwell (Democrat of Washington), Jean Carnahan (Democrat of Missouri), Hillary Rodham Clinton (Democrat of New York, and the former First Lady), Susan Collins (Republican of Maine), Dianne Feinstein (Democrat of California), Mary Landrieu (Democrat of Louisiana), Blanche Lincoln (Democrat of Arkansas), Barabara Mikulski (Democrat of Maryland, who worked with Hutchinson on the proposed bill), Patty Murray (Democrat of Washington), Olympia Snowe (Republican of Maine) and Debbie Stabenow (Democrat of Michigan) all signed on to the bill.
"I commend Senator Hutchison and Senator Mikulski for taking the initiative to introduce the Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001," Senator Murray said.
"Many of us have been working since the Taliban seized control in Afghanistan to give voice to women who have been silenced, beaten, harassed and even executed," she continued.
"Women in Kabul, Afghanistan represented 70 percent of the teachers when the Taliban came to power.
Women in Kabul represented 50 percent of the public employees and more than 40 percent of the medical professionals including doctors.
Women students made up 50 percent of the student body at Kabul universities," Murray told fellow lawmakers.
"Throughout Afghan society women served their country, their culture and their families as scientists and professors, as members of parliament, as leaders of their communities.
The Taliban changed all of that quickly and cruelly with little consideration for the rights of women or the many roles played in Afghan society by women," the Washington State lawmaker said.
The Taliban, she added, "now bans women from working as teachers, doctors or for that matter, in any profession."
"I rise today in support of a bill sponsored by Senators Hutchinson and Mikulski that would authorize the use of Federal resources to increase the education, health and living standards for women and children in living in Afghanistan, and as refugees in neighboring countries.
Importantly, it also specifies that this assistance is provided in a way that protects and promotes the human rights of all people in Afghanistan," Senator Olympia Snowe said.
The Maine Republican said it was "simply unconscionable" that American lawmakers "should even have to consider such a measure in this day and age."
However, she said, "the facts show that Congressional support for women in Afghanistan is nothing short of a moral imperative."
The issue, Snowe continued, "is a core human rights issue, and to ignore the plight of Afghan women is to turn our backs on a terrible wrong that we have the power and I would say the obligation as fellow human beings to help right."
When the Taliban seized power in 1996, she said, it began "a regime of gender-based apartheid."
The banishment of women from civic life has been enforced "with the most extreme brutality," Snowe said.
Under Taliban rule, Snowe continued, "girls aren't allowed to go to school.
And women have been expelled from the universities."
Women "are prohibited from leaving their homes at all unless accompanied by a close male relative, even in the event of a medical emergency for themselves or their children," she said.
The women "are under house arrest," Snowe said, "they are prisoners of their own homes."
By authorizing the President to provide educational and health care assistance to women and children living in Afghanistan or as refugees in neighboring countries, S. 1573 recognizes that "women must have a future in Afghanistan," Snowe said.
The potential for prosperity in Afghanistan can only be realized if "both men and women have an opportunity to participate and contribute," Snowe said.
"That's what this bill is all about, and I hope that my colleagues will join us in supporting it."
Following are the texts of speeches on S. 1573 by Senators Murray and Snowe from the Congressional Record: (begin text) Mrs. MURRAY.
Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today to again raise the plight of women, girls and children in Afghanistan.
I commend Senator Hutchison and Senator Mikulski for taking the initiative to introduce the Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001.
Many of us have been working since the Taliban seized control in Afghanistan to give voice to women who have been silenced, beaten, harassed and even executed.
Afghanistan has been in a cycle of war and conflict for more than twenty years.
These two decades have been hard on the Afghani people but especially difficult for women, young girls and children.
When the Taliban seized control in Afghanistan, the plight of women, girls and children went from a crisis existence to a catastrophic one.
As noted in our bill and mentioned by my colleagues, women in Kabul, Afghanistan represented 70 percent of the teachers when the Taliban came to power.
Women in Kabul represented 50 percent of the public employees and more than 40 percent of the medical professionals including doctors.
Women students made up 50 percent of the student body at Kabul universities.
Throughout Afghan society women served their country, their culture and their families as scientists and professors, as members of parliament, as leaders of their communities.
The Taliban changed all of that quickly and cruelly with little consideration for the rights of women or the many roles played in Afghan society by women.
The Taliban now bans women from working as teachers, doctors or for that matter, in any profession.
The Taliban closed schools to women.
Not just the teachers.
But to all young girls.
It is against the law for a young girl to attend a school in Afghanistan.
To attend school, women and young girls in Afghanistan risk floggings, death by stoning, or single shot execution.
Women cannot leave their homes without the heavy veil style clothing.
They must be accompanied by a male.
Women must not laugh or make noise in public.
The punishment for violating Taliban law as we have now seen in several informative documentary pieces can be deadly.
Many of my constituents have contacted me shocked and outraged at the video clip of the woman ushered into a soccer stadium to the jeers of a crowd.
She's forced onto the playing field on her knees where she is quickly executed by a single shot from a rifle.
Women in Afghanistan, every generation now living, is suffering under the Taliban rule.
Some have been forced from meaningful lives to absolute poverty.
Others now see no future in Afghanistan for themselves and their children.
Still others, war widows and elderly women, are forced into prostitution or forced to sell all of their possessions to feed themselves.
Yesterday, we passed the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.
I served on this subcommittee for a long time and its many programs offer hope to women in Afghanistan.
The Afghan Women and Children's Relief Act notes many of these programs.
We provide assistance to help educate and immunize young girls in the world.
We provide assistance in the form of maternal health care and family planning in the most needy areas of the world.
We support microcredit lending, particularly to women led households, in many impoverished areas of the world.
We support international organizations from UNICEF and other UN entities to non-governmental organizations based here in the United States and throughout the world.
Our bill would include Afghani women and girls in these vital programs.
As we look to aid women, young girls and children in Afghanistan, we must not assume that simply ending the Taliban rule will cure the problem.
We walked away from Afghanistan when the Cold War ended, we cannot do that again when the Taliban goes.
We must ensure that women and children are fully protected in the Afghan government which will eventually follow the Taliban.
Women in Afghanistan must be brought back -- fully brought back -- into Afghani society.
All of Afghanistan will be better when women are allowed again to teach, to serve publicly, and to treat illness.
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for raising this issue.
I join them as an original cosponsor of this legislation and I urge its prompt passage.
Further, I call on all of our colleagues to support the appropriate funding levels which will ultimately make a great difference in the lives of Afghani women, young girls and children.
