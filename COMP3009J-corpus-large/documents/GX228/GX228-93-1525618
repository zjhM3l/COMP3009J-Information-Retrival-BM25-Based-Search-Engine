Dimension Reduction and Sampling Imola K. Fodor and Chandrika Kamath Center for Applied Scientific Computing Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory SciDAC All-Hands Meeting, San Diego September 11-13, 2002 UCRL-PRES-149962.
This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by University of California Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract W-7405-Eng-48.
We are investigating dimension reduction and sampling techniques Problem: data from simulations and experiments is high dimensional (i.e. many features) Querying the features can help in understanding the data -- but, searching in a high-dimensional space is difficult May want to cluster similar objects for efficient access --but, clustering is expensive in high dimensions May want to analyze data --a representation in fewer dimensions would help Solution: use dimension reduction techniques But, dimension reduction techniques can be expensive if have many data items Solution: use sampling to appropriately reduce the number of data items CASC 2 Our work on dimension reduction will help both data management and mining Reducing the dimensions will improve --searching (LBNL) --clustering (ORNL) Dimension reduction can also help in data mining and scientific discovery focus of this talk Our initial focus is on climate data --complements work at ORNL on climate Our techniques are also applicable to other data --high-energy-physics data LBNL on HEP We only discuss the .8 FTE work funded under SciDAC; however, our data mining research is more extensive.

CASC 28 Dimension Reduction and Sampling: Mini Review Imola K. Fodor and Chandrika Kamath Center for Applied Scientific Computing Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory SciDAC All-Hands Meeting, San Diego September 11-13, 2002 CASC 29 Our work on climate data focuses on separating volcano and El NiÃ¯Â¿Â½o signals Atmospheric scientists are interested in understanding changes in global temperatures Simulated and observed data include effects of volcano eruptions, El NiÃ¯Â¿Â½o and Southern Oscillation (ENSO), etc.
We need to remove effects that are not shared by the different models to --make meaningful comparisons --understand effects of man-made contributions for global warming Domain expert Dr. Benjamin Santer (PCMDI, LLNL) Dimension reduction supporting scientific discovery CASC 30 The raw data: 264 monthly temperatures on a 144x73 spatial grid on 17 vertical levels Volcano ICA El NiÃ¯Â¿Â½o Other effects January 1979 raw temperatures (Kelvin) on the 144x73 latitude by longitude grid at 1000hPa pressure level.

Without the volcano eruption, the global temperatures would be higher in this model.

Ben Santer was very pleased when we showed him our results, and suggested further analyses.
CASC 35 Future plans What do you expect to achieve by Feb. 2003? What are your goals? What are your plans for achieving these goals? Why are these goals important? To whom? Which scientific domain and who are you working with as your token application scientist? Why is your work significant? Who will use it? How does your work compare with or differ from similar work by others? Why not simply adopt other people's work in you domain? What is your vision at the end of three years? Do you believe you can achieve that? Why? Do you think there will be unsolved problems in your domain at the end of three years? What would you plan to propose? CASC 36 What do you expect to achieve by Feb. 2003? What are your goals? Follow up on our discussion with Ben Santer -- look at the PCA time series for covariance and correlation matrices for zonal means -- incorporate post-processing suggested by Ben -- correlate with ENSO, volcano signals, and other time series -- investigate alternative ICA implementations -- summarize in a report See if possible to incorporate constraints in the ICA to separate non-linearly mixed signals: risky Complete a design of the ICA implementation in C++, incorporating our enhancements Goal: help to improve the climate scientist's understanding of how the signals can be separated CASC 37 What do you expect to achieve by Feb. 2003? What are your goals? (contd.)
Several aspects of our scientific discovery work are high risk -- poor understanding among climate scientists on how the various signals interact -- not always easy to interpret the output from ICA -- existing techniques not always well understood -- techniques work in some cases but not in others We may not be able to solve the entire problem -- but, any progress is valued by Ben Santer -- even a negative result! -- still an important problem that generates great interest The techniques are very specific to this problem Scientific discovery is hard! CASC 38 What are your plans for achieving these goals? Understand and implement the post-processing needed for the PCs Convert the PCA "images" into time series Implement the correlation between the PCs and the various signals to see if we can determine which PC represents what Investigate new ICA implementations that give more "meaningful" ICs ICA with constraints (risky) -- literature search -- software implementation in Matlab CASC 39 Why are these goals important? To whom? They help us to better understand the behavior of the earth's temperature when naturally occurring phenomena are removed -- identify the contributions of man-made sources -- understand global warming -- make better comparisons of climate models A better understanding of how the signals interact and can be removed is of interest to climate scientists such as Ben Santer CASC 40 Which scientific domain, and who is your application scientist? Climate Ben Santer, Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) -- MacArthur fellowship for research supporting the finding that human activity contributes to global warming Future (beyond this domain): HEP, working with LBNL CASC 41 Why is your work significant? Who will use it? Our work helps in better understanding of the separation of sources contributing to the temperature For our work so far, we expect that our findings will contribute to a better understanding of climate models and global warming The results will be used by climate scientists Future (beyond Feb'03): -- investigate other dimension reduction techniques for this problem -- use the dimension reduction techniques in conjunction with sampling to improve indexing and clustering in HEP data CASC 42 How does your work compare with others? Why not simply adopt their work? To the best of our knowledge, no one else is looking at techniques such as ICA for the separation of mixed signals in climate data The existing techniques for this problem are simplistic and involve knowing something about the kinds of signals that are mixed Our approach tries to find the signals in the mix without knowing what kinds of signals they are Future (beyond this problem) -- No one else is looking at effective sampling to improve the efficiency of dimension reduction CASC 43 What is your vision at the end of three years? Do you believe you can achieve it? Scientific discovery -- Investigate more complex mixing models -- understand how much PCA, ICA, and related techniques can contribute to the separation of the signals -- issue: to determine when we have reached the point of diminishing returns Software tools -- for PCA, ICA, and related techniques -- with sophisticated sampling for large data sets A better understanding of how these techniques apply to real datasets in climate and high energy physics CASC 44 Will there be unsolved problems at the end of 3 years? What will you propose? Definitely! Climate, high energy physics and other applications are replete with data analysis problems -- application of dimension reduction techniques -- analysis of time series data -- analysis of HEP data CASC 45
