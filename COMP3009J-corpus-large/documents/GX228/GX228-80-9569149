INTRODUCTION "There is no single greater threat to our way of life in New Jersey than the unrestrained, uncontrolled development that has jeopardized our water supplies, made our schools more crowded, our roads congested, and our open space disappear."
Gov. James E. McGreevey, 2003 State of the State Address P reservi n g Eq uit y Recognizing the importance of equity, the State Planning Commission made it the number-one statewide policy of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, adopted first in 1992 and again in 2001.
The impact assessments prepared by Rutgers University on both plans acknowledge the need to address equity by using a broad array of programs to preserve farmland, including the purchase or transfer of development rights.
This Agricultural Smart Growth Plan reflects the State Planning Commission's position that "the achievement, protection and maintenance of equity be a major objective in public policy decisions..."
Indeed, the maintenance of equity is an underlying tenet of this Agricultural Smart Growth Plan and a guiding principle that is carefully woven throughout all five components.
In his 2003 State of the State Address, Governor James E. McGreevey vowed to say "no more" to mindless sprawl and instead to say, "yes" to smart growth.
But what does smart growth have to do with agriculture? A lot.
New Jersey has a finite land base of 4.8 million acres that is shared by urban, suburban and rural communities alike.
Much of that land is already developed or has been preserved through various open space and farmland preservation initiatives.
What remains is 1.7 million acres of unprotected, undeveloped land, more than half of which is actively devoted to agriculture and forestry production.
This is land where the cranberries we enjoy on Thanksgiving are harvested, where the sweet corn we look forward to on the 4th of July is grown, and where the mums that decorate our homes in the fall are produced.
However, active farmland, with its open landscape and deep soil, is as attractive to backhoe as it is to tractor.
As a result, farmland is in high demand for development in what is already the most densely populated state in the nation and is too often viewed as just another location for more houses.
If New Jersey is to fight sprawl and retain its farmers, this thinking must change.
Consider what would occur if New Jersey were entirely paved over.
Green, open spaces would vanish.
Traffic would become even more congested than it already is.
Air and water quality would suffer.
Classrooms would be overcrowded and municipal services overburdened.
Access to locally grown fresh food would diminish.
Who would want to live, work or raise a family in a state like that? New Jerseyans must realize that an important balance exists between the state's cities, suburbs and rural areas.
To maintain that balance, New Jersey needs agriculture.
Productive farmland: helps keep municipal taxes down, increases property values, benefits the environment, adds to a community's character, is part of New Jersey's heritage, 4 ensures that New Jersey residents continue to have access to an abundant supply of locally produced fresh food and agricultural products.
Did you know New Jersey's food and agriculture complex contributes $63 billion annually to the state's economy?
New Jersey is one of the nation's top 10 producers of a variety of fruits and vegetables, from spinach and bell peppers to tomatoes and sweet corn.
The state ranks second in blueberry production, third in cranberry production and fourth in peach production nationally.
Abraham Browning, a well-known political leader in Camden County in the 1800s, compared New Jersey to "an immense barrel filled with good things to eat and open at both ends with Pennsylvanians grabbing from one end and the New Yorkers from the other."
Browning's remark, at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia on Jersey Day, August 24, 1876, is believed to have led to New Jersey garnering the nickname Garden State.
Today, New Jersey is home to more than 9,000 farmers, some who own their land and others who lease.
All are stewards of the agricultural working landscape from fields to forests.
Many are growing crops that make Jersey Fresh produce known nationally.
Others are raising livestock, primarily horses, which are recognized across the country.
New Jersey's horticultural industry is among the strongest in the Northeast, and aquaculture continues to grow.
In order to sustain this modern-day, diverse food and agricultural industry, New Jersey must have a comprehensive Agricultural Smart Growth plan that ensures the farming community and local and county governments have the necessary guidance, education and tools to accommodate growth.
At the same time, the plan must seek to ensure the state protects its most valuable natural resources, supports urban development and redevelopment, and encourages wiser use of the state's existing infrastructure.
New Jersey agriculture is at a critical crossroads today, as farmland is disappearing at an average rate of 10,000 acres a year.

In 2002, the voluntary program surpassed the 100,000-acre mark for preserved farmland, marking a major milestone in its 20-year history.
And by the end of 2003, the Garden State's Farmland Preservation Program will have permanently preserved more than 14 percent of its agricultural land base, more than any other state in the nation.
In his State of the State speech, Governor McGreevey pledged to preserve a record 20,000 acres of farmland per year, continuing to accelerate the pace of the program.
That ambitious goal is also reflected in the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's Strategic Plan.
While farmland preservation may be the cornerstone of the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan, the future of New Jersey agriculture in an expanding, worldwide market also depends upon innovative planning techniques, economic development, natural resource conservation, and programs and policies to sustain a viable industry.
These five components make up the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan and are inextricably linked.
New Jersey cannot preserve the agricultural industry by protecting the land alone.
Public policy must support farms and agriculture-related businesses.
Agriculture must be integrated into economic development efforts.
Growth planning must consider the needs of the individual farmer, the industry and New Jersey's rural communities.
Education and training must equip the next generation of farmers to succeed in a rapidly changing agribusiness environment.
This Agricultural Smart Growth Plan reflects the definition of smart growth as set forth by the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan.
"Smart growth is the term used to describe well-planned, wellmanaged growth that adds new homes and creates new jobs, while preserving open space, farmland and environmental resources.
Smart growth supports livable neighborhoods with a variety of housing types, price ranges and Five Components of the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Farmland Preservation Innovative Conservation Planning Economic Development Natural Resource Conservation Agricultural Industry Sustainability 6 multi-modal forms of transportation.
Smart growth is an approach to landuse planning that targets the state's resources and funding in ways that enhance the quality of life for residents in New Jersey.
Smart growth principles include mixed-use development, walkable town centers and neighborhoods, mass transit accessibility, sustainable economic and social development and preserved green space.
Smart growth can be seen all around us: it is evident in larger cities such as Elizabeth and Jersey City; in smaller towns like Red Bank and Hoboken, and in rural communities like Chesterfield and Hope.
In New Jersey, smart growth supports development and redevelopment in recognized centers a compact form of development as outlined in the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, with infrastructure that serves the economy, the community and the environment."
The New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan provides a twopronged approach to sustaining agriculture.
First, under the plan, 23 statewide policies are designed to provide an effective agricultural strategy that creates a supportive climate for farming and plans for its future economic growth and development in ways that promote continued use of the land for agriculture without undermining property values.
Second, planning area policies guide development into centers to protect the outlying agricultural areas by encouraging the use of planning and land use techniques that maintain a farmer's equity in the land.
In January 2003, the delegates to the State Agriculture Convention, including the State Board of Agriculture, endorsed a resolution recognizing that the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan will chart the course for the future of agriculture in New Jersey.
The resolution stresses the need for innovative planning and design to stem the loss of farmland to development, while making it explicitly clear that maintaining the land's value is central to the economic viability and retention of farming operations.
The resolution also reflects the agricultural community's opposition to down zoning, large lot zoning and any other zoning that has the practical effect of large-lot zoning.
These zoning practices fracture and consume farmland, promote land- 7 consumptive sprawl, adversely impact landowner equity and are counterproductive to the principles of smart growth.
Instead, the agricultural community supports equitable and feasible densitytransfer methods, such as clustering, to coordinate preservation planning in conjunction with regional growth management.
New Jersey's smart growth efforts must include agriculture, as that is what keeps farmlands green and productive, brings farm-fresh products into our homes and makes New Jersey a better place to live and visit.
A strong, vibrant, and diverse agricultural industry will help the Garden State achieve its smart growth goals and strengthen New Jersey's dynamic agricultural character.
By preserving this agricultural character, New Jersey continues to support traditional agriculture, but also provides opportunities for new and emerging agricultural markets, such as hydroponics and aquaculture.
Together, the traditional and the new enable the state's agricultural industry to continue contributing to the economic success of a diverse Garden State.
This plan, developed by the Agriculture Smart Growth Working Group under the leadership of Agriculture Secretary Charles M. Kuperus, is a roadmap for agriculture in the 21st century and will be integrated into the statewide comprehensive plan for smart growth.
The plan is not meant to replace the good planning work that is taking place throughout the state, but is meant to focus on the five components that are critical to agriculture.
This plan is also meant to be integrated with plans developed by other state agencies, such as the departments of Community Affairs, Environmental Protection and Transportation.
Integration will ensure that all state-level plans and programs support the objectives and strategies of the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan and will help avoid potential conflicts among various plans and programs.
Like the agricultural industry itself, this plan will evolve as New Jersey moves forward with its smart growth efforts.
The New Jersey Department of Agriculture is committed to working with other state and federal agencies, county and local governments and the farming community to evaluate and refine the plan as necessary to maintain its effectiveness.
8 This plan ensures farmers, who are on the front lines in the fight against sprawl, have a voice in ongoing discussion about how and where New Jersey will grow.
Perhaps most importantly, the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan puts the interests of farmers and the agricultural industry in the forefront, as the state considers important decisions related to managing growth and balancing competing interests.
This plan repositions agriculture for a strong future a future that protects the state's farms, creates new economic opportunities for farmers and ensures a better quality of life for all New Jerseyans.
9 FARMLAND PRESERVATION Permanently preserving privately owned productive agricultural land ensures a stable land base for the future of the agricultural industry.
Farmland preservation, the foundation of the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan, is an important investment in our economy, our farming heritage and the overall quality of life for each and every New Jerseyan for generations to come.
O verview Agriculture's very existence is dependent upon a A Unique Landscape New Jersey's diverse agricultural industry has adapted to the unique landscapes of the Garden State.
The rugged terrain of the northwest is home to grain, livestock and dairy operations.
The vast, well-drained sandy soils of the south provide for an abundant vegetable and nursery industry.
The rolling pasture lands of central Jersey provide fruit, grain, hay and bucolic horse farms, while the acidic soils and bogs of the Pinelands produce beautiful blueberries and cranberries. stable land base.
Even with new innovations in greenhouse and hydroponics production, open and available land is essential for the vast majority of agricultural production.
Without farmland, where would farmers grow their crops? Or raise their livestock? What would happen to our local food supply? How would we recharge the aquifers that provide us our fresh drinking water? These are serious questions as New Jersey's farmland faces an imminent threat of permanent conversion to nonfarm uses.
The state's citizens have already made it clear that the retention and development of an economically viable agricultural industry is a high priority, voting time and again to approve bond issues and dedicated property taxes for the preservation of farmland and open space.
By year's end, New Jersey will have permanently preserved 120,000 acres of agricultural land since the establishment of the Farmland Preservation Program in 1983.
In November 1998, New Jersey citizens voted overwhelmingly to amend the State Constitution to dedicate a portion of existing sales tax revenues to farmland, open space and historic preservation.
The Garden State Preservation Trust Act, signed in 1999, further boosted the Farmland Preservation Program by establishing, for the first time in history, a stable source of funding for farmland preservation efforts.
Because of this public commitment, New Jersey continues to be a national leader in preserving farmland, with more than 14 percent of its agricultural land base preserved by the end of 2003.
Clearly, New Jersey recognizes the important benefits of preserving farmland.
Preserved farmland often has a positive environmental impact locally and statewide; as well-managed, productive farmland provides a portion of the land base necessary to manage watersheds, recharge aquifers, manage wildlife and protect stream corridors.
This is especially true when proper conservation practices are implemented.
12 Preserved farmland also preserves a way of life for farmers and non-farmers alike.
Where else could families go to pick their own strawberries in the spring and hunt for pumpkins in the fall? Who hasn't slowed at least once to marvel at cows in a pasture or horses in a field as they drove along the state's more scenic byways? Many hard-working farmers who sell their rights to develop their land reinvest the capital back into their farm operations, retire debt, or use the income to acquire land and expand their existing agricultural operation.
The easement purchase program also enables farmers to plan for retirement while still maintaining their land and deriving income from it.
The State Agriculture Development Committee administers the Farmland Preservation Program.
The voluntary program offers a variety of Farmland Preservation Programs Ã¯Â¿Â½ County Easement Purchase: Landowners sell the development rights to their county.
Landowners retain ownership of the land, but agree to permanent deed restrictions that prohibit nonagricultural development.
The state provides grants to counties to fund between 60 to 80 percent of the cost to purchase the development rights on approved farms.
The county, municipality, or both come up with the difference of 20 to 40 percent.
Direct Easement: The state purchases the development rights on farmland directly from the landowner, and the landowner retains ownership of the land.
Fee Simple: Farms are purchased outright from willing sellers, permanently preserved for agricultural use and resold or leased with deed restrictions attached.
Grants to Nonprofits: The state provides costsharing grants of up to 50 percent to assist nonprofit organizations in permanently preserving farms.
Planning Incentive Grants: These are grants to municipalities or counties that have identified specific project areas where they intend to permanently protect large blocks of reasonably contiguous farmland.
Municipalities must have an agricultural advisory committee and their master plan must contain a farmland preservation plan.
Eight Year Program: An eight-year program allows landowners to voluntarily restrict nonagricultural development on their property for eight years in exchange for selected easement purchase benefits, such as protection from emergency water restrictions and access to soil and water conservation matching grants.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ options for landowners that provide for the preservation of land in perpetuity or for a limited term of eight years.
The Farmland Preservation Program is one of the most fiscally responsible methods of preserving land for several reasons: Once the land is preserved there are no additional maintenance costs to the taxpayer; the land remains on the tax rolls, stabilizing the local tax burden, and because only easements are purchased, the state is able to stretch its funds to preserve many more farms than if the land were purchased outright.
Inarguably, preserved farmland helps offset the high cost of providing government services to residential developments.
A September 2001 American Farmland Trust study found that, on average, for every dollar in tax revenue, farms require just 36 cents in government services.
Residential property, however, requires $1.15 in government services.
13 The New Jersey State Agriculture Development Committee recognizes the importance of focusing preservation efforts in viable agricultural areas and primarily preserves farms in Agricultural Development Areas.
Agricultural Development Areas are defined as regions of productive agricultural lands that have a strong potential for future production.
In keeping with the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan, the State Agriculture Development Committee, through its Strategic Targeting Project, is working with counties to develop a more strategic approach to prioritizing farmland preservation investments among all levels of government.
This coordinated planning approach will improve preservation efforts and guide decision making across all programs within the State Agriculture Development Committee and ultimately enhance the agricultural industry.
The Strategic Targeting Project has three primary goals: Coordinate farmland preservation/agricultural retention efforts with proactive planning initiatives; Update and when necessary create maps to more accurately target preservation efforts in areas of important agricultural land; Coordinate farmland preservation efforts with open space, recreation and historic preservation investments.
As of November 2003, a draft Strategic Targeting Map had been developed by identifying the location and quality of agricultural soils, the location of land in agricultural production and the location of existing sewer service areas.
The next phase of analysis will incorporate the latest land-use information from counties, municipalities and other state agencies.
Data will include current county agriculture development area maps, Planning Incentive Grant project areas and information contained in County Comprehensive Farmland Preservation Plans.
This targeting effort will also consider other preservation and growth initiatives to determine how best to prioritize farmland preservation activities.
A landowner's decision to permanently preserve land is a serious commitment.
Therefore, it is imperative that efforts to preserve productive agricultural land are 14 efficient, coordinated and manageable, and serve to encourage greater participation in the program.

By targeting the preservation of important agricultural land, New Jersey is ensuring there will always be land available for agriculture production.
Yet, just because the land is available doesn't guarantee the viability of the agricultural industry.
Farmland preservation efforts must consider and incorporate the next four components of the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan if New Jersey's agricultural industry is truly going to thrive.
18 INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION PLANNING Under the innovative conservation planning approach, land conservation is the central organizing principle around which livable communities are created.
Purchase of development rights programs coupled with innovative conservation planning efforts help New Jersey grow in ways that consume less land and strike a balance between preservation and growth.
O verview New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation.
Farmland is disappearing at an average rate of 10,000 acres a year.
Fields where dairy cows once grazed and peach trees once blossomed are now home to shopping malls, houses and highways.
Many New Jersey towns are fed up with this development and want to stop growth completely.
Some scramble to preserve any parcel of land slated for development.
Others downzone open land typically active farmland to reduce the number of homes that are built and to limit infrastructure costs associated with residential development.
But these random and reactionary preservation efforts actually encourage sprawl and result in the loss of farmland.
Downzoning and large lot zoning may reduce the number of homes that can be built, but it also spreads out those homes in such a way that consumes more land, with none of the remaining land useable for farming, forestry or recreation.
Lots become "too large to mow, but too small to plow."
Downzoning also devalues agricultural land by reducing its development potential.
When a municipality decreases the land's development potential, it is also reducing a farmer's net worth and hurting the farmer's ability to obtain flexible financing at competitive interest rates.
This in turn increases the pressure on New Jersey's farmers whose land is often their primary financial asset.
The American Farmland Trust found the problem does not lie in growth itself, but in wasteful and destructive land use.
From 1982 to1997, the population in the United States grew by 17 percent, while urbanized land grew by 47 percent.
Furthermore, the nation's farmland disappeared 51 percent faster in the 1990s than it did in the 1980s.
Clearly, New Jersey is not alone in its struggle with the difficult task of managing growth.
While New Jersey should not stop growth, it can plan for it in a way that protects the state's most valuable farmland and other natural resources and ensures the continued viability of its agricultural industry.
21 A primary goal of the State Agriculture Development Committee's Strategic Targeting Project is to encourage counties to coordinate farmland preservation and agricultural retention efforts with local proactive planning initiatives that consider growth, open space, recreation and historic preservation.
This type of land use planning can be accomplished using an array of planning techniques that accommodate growth in rural areas while retaining productive agricultural lands.
Because agriculture is an industry in which land is the primary instrument of production, it is important to retain the land base by identifying and prioritizing key parcels for preservation.
Once these critical agricultural areas are identified, efforts can be made to steer development away from them and into areas with existing infrastructure or to marginal lands where infrastructure can be provided.
Prioritizing the importance of agricultural lands in a regional context, as called for in the Strategic Targeting Project, allows for the coordination of farmland preservation and agricultural retention efforts with proactive land use planning at all levels of government.
The New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan outlines many agricultural policies and specific land use techniques that should be implemented in the agricultural regions of the state.
These are areas with most of New Jersey's prime farmland, which has the greatest potential of sustaining the agricultural industry in the future.
In these planning areas, growth should be focused in existing and new rural centers where development is mixed in use and compact.
Ideally, the areas outside of these centers are maintained for agriculture by using planning techniques that address landowner equity and support farming.
Municipalities and counties have the option of using tools such as capacity analysis and build-out analysis to determine opportunities for as well as the implications of future growth and preservation.
Capacity analysis evaluates the ability of the environment and infrastructure, such as water supply, to support projected growth.
Build-out analysis illustrates what a town, region or county will look like if built to the full extent allowed by existing zoning.
Such an illustration can be an effective way to demonstrate the importance of proactive planning that balances the need to accommodate future growth and preserve natural resources.
22 Below are some of the land use techniques and infrastructure systems that support development and redevelopment.
These techniques and systems enable the accommodation of growth, the preservation of farmland and the continued viability of the agricultural industry.
These techniques must be used in tandem with the other components of the Agriculture Smart Growth Plan to sustain agriculture in New Jersey.
Agriculture-Friendly Zoning: Agriculture- friendly zoning is a comprehensive land use practice that coordinates zoning and land use policy in a proactive way to encourage agribusiness and reduce the incidence of farmer-homeowner nuisance issues.
The agricultural land use zone identifies active farms, farm product processing and farm support businesses as permitted uses.
The zoning regulations would consider the needs of farm operations and permit increased lot coverage, housing for agricultural labor, reduced front setbacks and less restrictive signage regulations.
These regulations can significantly reduce the regulatory obstacles, fees, fines, and nuisance complaints faced by many farmers when trying to comply with regulations designed for residential development, not farms.
Clustering: Clustering is a development design technique that concentrates buildings on a portion of land to allow the remainder to be preserved for agriculture, recreation, or environmental purposes.
Clustering is most effective when applied regionally as a component of a larger, overarching land use planning strategy, but the technique can be effectively applied on a single parcel of land.
When administered correctly, as an application of consistent land-use policy, clustering conserves land, cuts infrastructure costs, maintains landowner equity, and reduces the cost of government services.
It is also important for a municipality to require a developer to include state Right to Farm Act language in the deeds to the developed portion of a cluster project and ensure that the homeowners' association regulations specifically do not prohibit farming Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Incentives for Clustering Increased building densities and higher impervious cover limits, which allow developers to build more units on less land.
More liberal height restrictions.
Increased capacity for sewer and water infrastructure.
23 Conventional Versus Cluster Development Clustering is particularly appropriate in rural areas that wish to remain rural while accommodating additional growth.
(Plans from Rural By Design by Randall Arendt, 1994.)
The plan on the left illustrates a conventional development pattern, in which uniform-sized large lots (typically 2.5 acres or greater) blanket an entire development site, consuming all the land and obliterating the distinctive, natural features that made the site a special place.
The small pond at the center is hidden behind private lots, off-limits to most residents.
In contrast, the cluster development plan at right uses a greater variety of lot sizes (generally 1/4 to 1 acre in size) to accommodate the same number of units, while preserving substantial areas as open space.
The pond is preserved as an accessible amenity, linked with roadways to a trail.
As a result of more connections and linkages between streets, travel distances are shorter throughout the development.
The sparse arrangement of homes along the main roads on the perimeter allows an attractive, unobstructed view of the development's rural surroundings.
(From Growing Smart in Minnesota, The St. Croix Valley Development Design Study, prepared for the Metropolitan Council by Calthorpe Associates, January 2000) activities on the remaining parcel when the remainder is specifically set aside for agricultural preservation.
Clustering can be implemented on a voluntary or mandatory basis.
Typically, in voluntary situations, strong incentives are provided to encourage the use of clustering as opposed to existing conventional zoning.
Clustering in agricultural areas should be accompanied by land use policy that ensures that the most productive farmland is preserved while accommodating development on marginal land.
Most successful clustering schemes involving lots smaller than Ã¯Â¿Â½ acre use alternative wastewater treatment systems.
Towns in New Jersey and across the country are using a variety of wastewater technologies that provide treatment for small-scale communities ranging from 10 units to several hundred.
These systems can be utilized to enable compact growth patterns and can improve water quality in areas where septic systems are failing.
These systems produce clean water at the point of discharge that can replenish critical groundwater resources or can provide effluent for irrigation, municipalstreet cleaning and other suitable uses.
When these systems are used to cluster development on marginal lands, with the majority of the remaining land set aside with an easement restricting development, hundreds of acres of farmland can be preserved at no cost to the public.
Having preapproved designs for these "stand-alone" wastewater treatment systems can reduce the cost and limit the number of hookups.
The use of innovative infrastructure systems gives municipalities and counties the ability to plan for the future development of their community according to their own vision.
More than 30 of these systems have been serving several New Jersey communities for a number of years and are functioning well.
Density Transfer: New Jersey amended its Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL) in 1996 to encourage flexibility regarding density, intensity of land use and design.
Density transfer techniques can be used to engage landowners in a specific region of a municipality to change traditional land use patterns.
For example, the development potential from four farms can be transferred to one farm, allowing for the accommodation of growth and the permanent protection of four out of five farms.
Lot Size Averaging: Lot size averaging is a simple method to permit flexibility in lot size on a parcel of land.
This is an effective technique for smaller parcels (10-20 25 acres) that are proposed for subdivision where flexibility in lot size may help to preserve resources.
The overall density remains the same.
Only the lot sizes vary.
Transfer of Development Rights (TDR): Transfer of development rights (TDR) programs can protect farmland by shifting development from agricultural areas to areas targeted for growth.
TDR is the clustering of development, a tool that can be implemented in a portion of a township, townshipwide or regionally.
TDR allows landowners to transfer the right to develop from one parcel of land called a sending area, the area to be preserved to a different parcel of land called a receiving area, the area to accommodate growth.
At present, only Burlington County is empowered to implement TDR programs in New Jersey.
However, the Department of Agriculture collaborated with other state agencies to develop draft legislation to enable all counties in New Jersey to implement TDR.
To implement TDR, receiving areas and sending areas are designated and mapped in accordance with a comprehensive plan.
The sending area may include agricultural land, but the receiving districts must have the capacity and infrastructure necessary to support increased development and must be designed to meet other smart growth principles.
As a result, identifying the receiving area is the most challenging aspect of TDR, as specific guidance is needed regarding infrastructure criteria in the receiving area.
The state is committed to working with municipalities to assist in all aspects of TDR implementation.
Once the development rights are transferred from the sending area, the land is permanently restricted from development.
For this program to succeed, communities must agree on its use as a tool to protect special resources and direct future growth.
A market must exist for both the development rights and the higher density development that will result.
TDR programs can be voluntary or mandatory depending on the municipality's goals and needs.
In a voluntary program, the owner of property in a sending area can either transfer the development potential of that property to a receiving area or develop Innovative Conservation Planning Techniques Ã¯Â¿Â½ Agriculture Friendly Zoning Ã¯Â¿Â½ Clustering Ã¯Â¿Â½ Density Transfer Ã¯Â¿Â½ Lot Size Averaging Ã¯Â¿Â½ Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) Ã¯Â¿Â½ County Participation in Subdivision Review Ã¯Â¿Â½ Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ordinance Reform 26 the property in accordance with the land use ordinance in effect prior to the adoption of the TDR ordinance.
In a mandatory program, the owner of property in a sending area can either transfer the development potential of that property at the full value to a receiving area or develop the property at a much-reduced density.
Chesterfield, Burlington County: A TDR Success Story Established in 1997, Chesterfield Township's voluntary TDR program reflects the desire of its residents to promote the agricultural industry and retain the rural landscape of the township while encouraging planned economic and residential development.
The program aims to steer development from a 7,000-acre sending area to a 500-acre receiving area.
Through the use of creative land use and design techniques, the township created a planned village center with a mix of housing types, commercial businesses, offices and public spaces.
Critical to the success of the project was the extension of the sewer line from the Wagner Correctional Facility to the receiving area.
The township participated in the State Planning Commission's Center Designation process, designating the receiving areas as planned villages, Crosswicks as an existing village and Chesterfield and Sykesville as existing hamlets.
Chesterfield already had a strong farmland preservation program under which it preserved 4,000 acres of out of the 14,000 that make up the township.
27 The following elements are critical to a successful TDR program: Identification of "sending" and "receiving" areas.

County Involvement in Preliminary Subdivision Review: Although New Jersey is a home rule state wherein local governments have adopted the enabling legislation that grants them sole responsibility over the development of their land, a significant benefit to regional land use management may be realized by enabling the County Agriculture Development Boards (CADBs) to review and comment on subdivision and development proposals.
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs): Under planned unit developments, zoning provisions permit large lots to be developed in a more flexible way than allowed by the underlying zoning.
These ordinances may allow developers to mix land uses and develop at greater densities with more design flexibility, including by concentrating infrastructure needed to service the development or offering other community facilities and services.
Local governments can utilize these ordinances to negotiate significant design and use changes in development applications, while requiring developers to compensate for the 28 impacts of their projects by setting aside the undeveloped portion to be permanently maintained as agricultural land or open space.
Ordinance Reform: Municipalities have the ability to reform local zoning ordinances to encourage more compact growth and mixed-use development patterns in and around existing town centers or in new centers.
These techniques can be used in ways that consider land equity.
To encourage this type of development pattern, municipalities can: Provide incentives to cluster development in centers.
Reduce lot sizes, setbacks and yard requirements.
Allow a mix of commercial and residential uses in centers.
Increase permitted building heights.
Encourage pedestrian and bicycle-friendly features.
Provide for shared parking areas.
Permanently preserve a majority of the area's farmland.
Plant street trees and develop parks and recreation facilities to make town centers more attractive places to live and work.

31 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Stabilizing and fostering an active and productive agricultural industry is critical to retaining viable farms.
Facilitating investments in agricultural infrastructure supports, maintains and expands the business of farming.
At the same time, identifying and facilitating the creation of new markets helps farmers access an ever-changing marketplace.
Overview Just as important as preserving the state's farmland is preserving the state's farmers and the agricultural industry that sustains them.
New Jersey's diverse food and agriculture complex is valued at approximately $63 billion and benefits not only the state's economy, but also all New Jerseyans who enjoy locally grown food and farm products and privately maintained open space in their community.
From fruits and vegetables, nursery stock and aquacultured shellfish to corn, grain, field crops and livestock - New Jersey is far from a one-crop state.
Helping the industry to grow and expand is essential to maintaining the various working landscapes of agriculture.
A strong and vibrant agricultural industry will be in a position to resist development pressure and help New Jersey contain sprawl and achieve its smart growth goals.
The New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment Plan recognizes agriculture as a significant contributor to the state's economy and supports the industry's future economic growth in ways that promote the continuation of agricultural land use.
Several of the agricultural policies in the plan address economic development specifically.
However, most municipalities and counties do not consider agriculture when they plan for economic development activities in their region.
Although farmland preservation efforts have increased significantly throughout the state, protecting farmland from development alone does not guarantee that the land will be actively and viably farmed.
Formulating strategies that address farming as an economic sector supports farmland preservation efforts and strengthens the business of farming.
The geographical data contained in the Strategic Targeting Project will be a valuable tool to help municipalities and counties as well as the state identify key areas to locate agricultural industries and support businesses, based on the agricultural production of the region.
Identifying the state's key agricultural regions will help focus agricultural retention efforts and enable the implementation of the objectives outlined throughout this Agriculture Smart Growth Plan.
34 The New Jersey Department of Agriculture's approach to smart growth planning connects farmland preservation efforts with economic development strategies and marketing opportunities for today's farmers.
New Jersey's proximity to large, affluent markets has always been an advantage Expanding the Marketplace As a result of efforts by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture to establish 10 new market opportunities Ã¯Â¿Â½ New Jersey schools received 3,300 cases of New Jersey peaches in 2003 to help alleviate a late-season oversupply of peaches.

for the state's food and agriculture industry.
In addition, the state's increasing immigrant population creates a new demand for agricultural products.
As consumer demands change, so too must the agricultural industry.
Identifying these new markets and providing the products consumers demand is an ongoing effort in the ever-changing agricultural industry.
In January 2003, the delegates of the 88 State Agricultural Convention endorsed economic development strategies for nine key sectors of New Jersey's food and agriculture industry.
These strategies address horticulture, produce, dairy, aquaculture, field crops, livestock, organic farming, equine and wine production.
These th Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ strategies are currently being implemented.
The Department recognizes that a healthy agricultural industry is largely dependent on healthy plants and animals.
The Department administers numerous programs to ensure the health of livestock and poultry and plant stock.
These programs help to safeguard animal and human health and ensure pest-free plants in the marketplace.
At the same time, the Department realizes that promoting the wide variety of agricultural products the Garden State offers is critical to sustaining the industry.
The Department's Jersey Fresh promotion program is a long-standing economic development tool.
This nationally recognized marketing and grading program promotes the 35 consumption of Jersey produced agricultural products and ensures consumers a highquality product.
For nearly 20 years, the Jersey Fresh program has been successful at strengthening consumer awareness of the traditional New Jersey-grown fruits and vegetables.
The Department will build on the success of this program and broaden the umbrella of products that are identified as Jersey produced.
In addition, strategies for supporting value-added products will be developed to increase farmer participation in the market chain and allow for additional income beyond the sale of fresh-market, New Jersey-grown commodities.
Value-added agriculture refers to taking raw agricultural products and refining them in some way to add further value to them, for example, through processing or packaging.
New markets typically start out small, but have the potential to grow into highly profitable sectors as agriculture continues to evolve to meet the demands of a changing marketplace.
Another way to ensure a strong food and agriculture industry statewide is for state agencies, counties and municipalities to commit to ensuring regulations and programs are flexible and supportive of the farming community.
It is critical that other state agencies, especially the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Community Affairs, the Department of Labor and the New Jersey Commerce Commission, consider the Agricultural Smart Growth Plan when making important decisions regarding existing and proposed infrastructure, developing and amending regulations and programs, and protecting environmental and historic resources.
It is especially critical for the Department of Agriculture to collaborate with the Department of Environmental Protection to craft regulations that provide flexibility for agricultural operations, while protecting the environment.
The New Jersey Department of Agriculture is committed to working with these state agencies to promote economic development activities and other improvements that will support and grow New Jersey's agricultural industry.

In order for agriculture to be successful in New Jersey, it must be economically viable.
Looking ahead for new and emerging markets, as well as alternative uses for products already grown in the state, is just as important as preserving farmland.
The diversity of New Jersey's agricultural products, coupled with the state's close proximity to major markets, creates a foundation for continued success for New Jersey's third largest industry.
Key to this success will be the commitment from municipalities, counties and other state agencies to incorporating agriculture into their economic development efforts.
39 NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION As stewards of the land, farmers must protect the quality of our environment and conserve the natural resources that sustain it by implementing conservation practices that improve water quality, conserve water and energy, prevent soil erosion and reduce the use of nutrients and pesticides.
Overview Soil.
Water.
Energy.
Little could grow without them.
That is why protecting and conserving these and other natural resources should be a priority of all who live and work in New Jersey, including farmers.
This is not a new idea for New Jersey or the nation.
Since 1935, when the Soil Conservation Act was passed - during the worst of the Dust Bowl - this country has recognized the importance of the land and its relation to the overall well being of the nation.
Various state and federal programs have been initiated to protect natural resources.
The programs have evolved over the years to take advantage of advances in agricultural practices.
The New Jersey Department of Agriculture helps to protect and conserve the state's soil, water and related natural resources through the stewardship efforts of its natural resource conservation program.
This program offers technical, financial and regulatory assistance and provides educational outreach to landowners throughout the state.
In addition to the Department's program, a variety of other federal and state programs exist to provide technical and financial assistance to landowners for the conservation, protection and improvement of soil, water, air, and related resources.
A number of programs provide assistance to eligible landowners to address wetlands, woodlands, and wildlife habitat.
A few of the voluntary programs even provide payments to producers who have historically practiced good stewardship on their land and provide incentives to those who want to do more.
The 2002 Farm Bill placed a greater emphasis on the implementation of new and expanded conservation programs that help protect our soil resources and improve water quality.
The Department, through the State Soil Conservation Committee, is planning for the strategic implementation of these programs as well as state conservation programs.
The Committee, in the fall of 2003, began coordinating an initiative for Soil Conservation Districts to perform a natural resource assessment to determine conservation needs and priorities at the local level.
This effort will help to identify the appropriate conservation programs to implement and the technical and financial assistance needed in each district area.
42 The 2002 Farm Bill also provides funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), which provides technical, financial and educational assistance to farmers for conservation practices that address natural resource concerns.
However, based on past experience, it is unlikely this federal conservation planning and design.

The Department is currently working in conjunction with the Natural Resources Conservation Service to continue to provide and enhance these service centers and increase the necessary technical assistance to farmers.
Outside of the Farm Bill programs, the Department and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection jointly developed a Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) proposal that Governor McGreevey submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture.
New Jersey's program seeks to enroll 30,000 acres of agricultural lands into conservation practices that will improve the quality of runoff from these lands.
This program encourages farm owners to voluntarily implement conservation practices on their land by offering financial incentives for participation.
The program provides a 10-year enrollment period and targets the installation of riparian buffers, filter strips, contour buffer strips and grass waterways.
Farmers will be able to enroll their land in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program by installing conservation practices under 10-15 year rental agreements and/or permanent easement contracts.
Of the 2.1 million acres of forested land in New Jersey, 1.3 million are privately owned, 326,000 are owned by the state and 73,000 are Did you know that New Jersey farmers provide more than 70,000 families with Christmas trees each year? 43 federally owned.
The remainder are owned by other public entities.
Combined, forested land and productive farmland account for more than 60 percent of New Jersey's land base.
Forestlands are often components of larger traditional agricultural operations, but are also considered to be a form of agriculture on their own.
Like other forms of agriculture, woodlands require management strategies to continue to provide income to the landowner while ensuring the protection and preservation of other vital resources, including clean surface water, adequate groundwater supplies, and soil retention.
Recent droughts have sensitized farmers to the need for adequate farm water supplies, efficient water conservation irrigation systems and an irrigation water management regimen that reduces unnecessary water use.
Although agriculture accounts for a small portion of the state's total water use, the availability of an adequate and sustainable water supply for agricultural purposes is becoming more problematic.
Competing user demands and limitations in critical water supply areas only exacerbate this problem.
The Department is working with Rutgers Cooperative Extension, the Natural Resources Conservation Services, the United States Geological Survey, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the farm community to assess the water needs of agriculture and to assist in the development of essential rules, policies and guidelines to ensure an adequate water supply to meet the current and future needs of the agricultural industry.
Finally, as part of a national Clean Water Action Plan, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have proposed a unified national strategy for addressing water quality concerns on animal farm operations.
At the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection prepared a statewide strategy outlining how Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) and Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs) will be managed and/or regulated.
The strategy, under existing legislative authority and through cooperative agreements, calls for the state Department of Environmental Protection to administer the required permits for CAFOs and the New Jersey Department of Agriculture to administer the appropriate measures for AFOs.
A CAFO general permit is now available through the Department of Environmental Protection.
The primary 44 requirement of the permit is the development and implementation of a comprehensive waste management plan.
The Department of Agriculture is developing an animal waste program with criteria and standards for the proper disposal of animal wastes, including the waste generated from aquaculture.
This program will emphasize the use of costeffective voluntary measures and limit the need for permits, primarily through the implementation of farm conservation plans.

To protect the state's natural resources is to also protect the state's agricultural industry.
Few would argue about the importance of an abundant supply of clean water and clean soil to maintaining a viable agriculture.
Preserving farms and planning for growth are key to maintaining the industry, but what kind of industry would there be without the natural resources to sustain it? Through the use of conservation practices and through policies and programs at the state, county and local levels, New Jersey can ensure that natural resources will remain available to sustain not only the state's agricultural industry, but all who live and work in the Garden State.
Did you know that in 2002, New Jersey recycled nearly 26,000 pounds of plastic pesticide containers, nursery pots, flats and five gallon plastic buckets, and 472,000 pounds of nursery and greenhouse film? 47 AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY SUSTAINABILITY Creating an environment that supports the agricultural industry at the municipal, county and state levels demonstrates that agriculture is a preferred land use in New Jersey and encourages the retention of thriving and diverse farming operations.
Educating the next generation of farmers, welcoming newcomers and ensuring the safety and well-being of today's farm workers are critical components of maintaining a profitable, strong agricultural industry poised for a bright future.
Overvie w Sustaining a profitable, modern-day agricultural industry ensures that Garden State residents will continue to have access to an abundant supply of locally grown food and agricultural products.
Preserving the land base is the initial step.
The next is ensuring the farmer can continue to work profitably on the land.
A thriving industry is largely dependent upon public policies, including laws, rules and programs that are tailored to meet the agricultural industry's unique needs.
At the same time, the industry must have access to a well-trained and educated workforce to be successful.
In addition, while the general public appreciates the products of New Jersey's farms, many may not understand the process that brings fresh eggs to their breakfast tables, apples to their children's lunches and corn to their summer barbecues.
The public must recognize that commercial agriculture is first and foremost a business a business that may create noise and odors or generate traffic from delivery trucks and tour buses.
The existence of viable farms and therefore the open space New Jerseyans enjoy is largely dependent upon the business' ability to operate profitably.
Agriculture must be recognized as a priority by state and local leaders when making policy decisions regarding taxation, regulations and financial incentives.
Tax incentives, such as the Farmland Assessment program, keep land in farms by reducing the property tax on active farmland.
However, this incentive program does not apply to farm structures, such as barns and storage facilities, and farmsteads.
Abatements and exemptions that encourage farmers to maintain their buildings in good working order and do not penalize them for renovating or replacing old or unsafe structures can benefit not only the farmer, but the entire community.
Regulatory programs, such as the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Water Allocation Program, give special consideration to the industry's water needs and provide for a separate certification and registration process.
Financial incentives, such as the income averaging legislative proposal introduced in March 2003, help stabilize a farmer's bottom line by recognizing the high-risk, 50 cyclical nature of farming.
Under income averaging, New Jersey farmers can average out yearly gains and losses over a four-year period to even out their tax liability.
Just as important is New Jersey's Right to Farm Act, which provides eligible farmers who operate responsibly with protection from overly restrictive municipal ordinances, and public and private nuisance actions.
The Act, the strongest in the nation, provides increased protection to those farmers who operate in accordance with agricultural management practices that have been adopted by the State Agriculture Development Committee.
The Act gives primary jurisdiction in resolving operations complaints to against agricultural Agriculture County Right to Farm Act at a Glance The Act provides commercial farm owners or operators with certain protections from restrictive municipal ordinances and public and private nuisance actions.
To receive these protections, commercial farms must be in conformance with federal and state laws, agricultural management practices recommended by the State Agriculture Development Committee or site-specific agricultural management practices.
They also must not be a direct threat to health and public safety, must be located in an area where agriculture was a permitted use under municipal zoning ordinances and must have been operating as of December 31, 1997.
Protected activities under the Act include production, processing and packaging of agricultural products, farm market sales, and agriculture-related education and farm-based recreational activities that are related to marketing of the farm's agricultural products.
An alternative conflict resolution process can help improve communication among farmers, municipalities and private citizens, and reduce litigation time and expense.
Development Boards, and ultimately to the State Agriculture Development Committee if decisions of the County Boards are appealed.
The Committee also offers a voluntary mediation program that disputing parties can use instead of going directly to court and has the authority to review municipal actions in Agricultural Development Areas to determine their potential impact on agricultural operations.
Still, right-to-farm conflicts are typically the number one concern of farmers.
Many people want to live near a farm to enjoy the rural character it provides.
However, once they move in they often discover that rural character means more than pretty open spaces and traditional, small-town values.
Rural character includes tractors on local roads, odors and early morning noise.
As the New Hampshire Office of State Planning points out: "Everyone wants the calendar-photography scenes of rural character, but along with the pretty side of rural character comes a gritty side."
51 That gritty side can create conflict between farmers and neighbors and often municipal governments who don't understand the business of agriculture.
Many people don't want to see or live near farm worker housing.
Neighbors and municipal leaders often would prefer acres and acres of open fields rather than greenhouses.
Municipal officials sometimes enact overly restrictive ordinances that can hamper a farmer's ability to run a profitable farm market operation.
With increased pressures from local development, agricultural operators need a strong commitment from their municipalities.
The most effective right-to-farm support must occur at the municipal level.
Municipal right-to-farm ordinances that are consistent with the state's model indicate to residents that the local community supports agriculture as an industry and a land use.
In addition to right-to-farm ordinances, state, county and municipal regulations must also be sensitive to the needs of farmers.
Small changes to or exemptions from certain regulations can protect agricultural operations from unnecessary costs and create a farmer-friendly environment.
State, county and local officials must be conscious of farm machinery when planning road improvements to ensure that farmers can move efficiently on local roads.
One way to address this is through the delineation and special consideration of commonly traveled agricultural routes.
Local officials need to be aware of changes to building and tax codes as well as fees as they relate to agricultural operations.
Counties and municipalities must Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Pulling it all Together: A Rural Redevelopment Success Story The City of Bridgeton, Cumberland County, in October 2003, received a $3 million low-interest loan for the construction of 40 duplex rental units exclusively for farm workers and their families.
The funding the result of cooperative efforts among federal, state and local partners was the first such funding for off-farm housing in New Jersey in more than a decade.
As part of a comprehensive redevelopment strategy, the housing will be designed to reflect the character of Bridgeton's historic district.
This approach is a model program that addresses several needs at once by: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Providing desperately needed quality housing for agricultural workers, whose efforts drive the local economy.
Visually and functionally integrating all socio-economic groups into the community.
Promoting appreciation of local history, which improves community morale and sense of place.
52 also be sensitive to the negative economic impacts caused by excessive wildlife populations and support the federal, state, and local efforts to minimize the damages.
Some municipalities may take advantage of the variety of grant and loan programs offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program.
Grants and loans are available in three key areas: Rural Business-Cooperative Service, Rural Housing Service and Rural Utilities Service.
Unfortunately, many of New Jersey's rural municipalities may not qualify for many of the programs offered because most are unavailable to cities with more than 50,000 residents or municipalities with more than 10,000 residents.
While the population criteria for these programs may make sense in a large portion of the country, they do not make sense for New Jersey.
Efforts are underway to reevaluate specific program criteria to make these programs available to New Jersey's rural communities, especially the regional centers serving the state's most rural regions.
It is also important farmers understand and participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's risk management programs to insure their operations against potential losses.
The New Jersey Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, conducts farm risk management and crop insurance education programs to assist farmers in understanding what assistance is available to reduce agricultural risks.
Understanding and addressing the labor needs of the industry are also critical to sustaining viable farming operations.
Without an adequate labor supply, crops cannot be harvested, livestock cannot be properly cared for, and the agricultural industry cannot continue to provide food for our tables.
The supply of farm laborers must meet demand.
When U.S. workers are unavailable to meet the demand, employers traditionally look to foreign workers for relief.
Currently, nonimmigrant foreign workers can be employed temporarily in agriculture under specific provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
However, this process has its own set of limitations that make it unworkable for many agricultural employers.
This fall federal lawmakers introduced AgJOBS the Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act of 2003.
AgJOBS supports much needed reforms to the guest 53 worker visa program (H-2A) and also allows for the short-term, on a one-time basis, workers with a significant work history in American agriculture to stay in the United States legally and earn adjustment to legal status.
Although vital to agriculture, hired farm workers continue to be one of the most economically disadvantaged groups in the United States, with low wages, seasonal employment and limited participation in the non-farm labor market.
More can be done to ensure a well-trained farm labor workforce and to improve farm worker living and working conditions.
Housing and training opportunities need to be considered.
Quality housing, along with an educated workforce, will improve the quality of life for farm workers and enable them to perform even more efficiently.
A comprehensive, ongoing worker safety program is also critical to improving working conditions and retaining experienced workers.
Farm owners and employees need to implement proper safety measures to prevent injury and death.
Ongoing worker training includes lessons on: Safe handling of pesticides, Safe handling of power tools, Safe operation of farm vehicles, and Appropriate emergency response protocols.
From training the farm worker to equipping future farmers to lead and manage the state's food, agricultural and natural resource industry, agriculture education takes on many forms.
High school agricultural education programs provide classroom instruction, workbased learning, and career and leadership development for FFA members and other students considering careers in agriculture or related fields.
The national Agriculture in the Classroom program helps to make K-12 students aware of the importance of agriculture.
4-H is an informal, practical educational program for youth, while the New Jersey Agricultural Society's Agriculture Leadership Program provides young adults in agriculture with leadership development skills and opportunities.
While these programs are valuable, it is imperative they are coordinated to eliminate duplication of effort and to 54 maximize educational opportunities for New Jersey's next generation of agricultural managers and leaders.
For agriculture education programs to be effective, it's important the industry's leadership and employment needs are identified and communicated to educators preparing young people for careers in agriculture.
An educational curriculum that addresses the needs of the food and agricultural industry, and the natural resources that sustain it, is needed at the secondary and post-secondary education level.
Educational programs in agriculture must be offered as an optional and viable opportunity for the youth and adults of New Jersey who are interested in pursuing such careers.
Education in agricultural production and business practices for those currently involved in agriculture is just as important as programs for those who have an interest in changing to or initially choosing a career in agriculture.

57 CONCLUSION "Agriculture contributes to the quality of life in our communities in many ways, providing natural buffers against sprawl, enabling us to enjoy fresh, locally grown food and other farm products, and helping to ensure a traditional way of life for current and future generations of hard-working farm families.
By preserving our farms and ensuring that agriculture is profitable, we can retain our farms and keep our farmers on the land."
Agriculture Secretary Charles M. Kuperus, following Gov. McGreevey's call to preserve 20,000 acres of farmland a year January 2003 This Agricultural Smart Growth Plan provides realistic and practical approaches to ensuring that as New Jersey continues to grow, its agriculture industry remains strong.
It details the contributions productive farmland makes to the quality of life for Garden State residents and outlines the critical role agriculture plays in the state's smart growth efforts.
This plan provides the basic framework for planning for agriculture at all levels and establishes common principles to be used to guide preservation and development activities throughout the state.
Chief among these principles is the importance of maintaining land values for New Jersey's farmers.
This Agricultural Smart Growth Plan needs to be embraced and implemented by the agriculture community in its entirety.
Ensuring the industry's continued success is a collaborative effort, already supported by the successful open space referendums in more than 200 municipalities and counties statewide.
New Jersey is proud to be the nation's leader in farmland preservation, but we cannot depend on that alone to keep the agriculture industry strong and viable.
We must plan for the needs of our communities and recognize the agricultural industry's important role in maintaining a balance that enhances the quality of life in New Jersey and across the region.
By considering agriculture as a key component of its overall Smart Growth Plan, New Jersey can take a leadership role in the national fight against sprawl.
Understanding how a viable and productive agricultural industry is integral to all regions of the state - urban, suburban and rural - is an important first step in that effort.
It is hoped that this plan may be used as a starting point for agricultural leaders in neighboring states to embark on a collaborative and cooperative process to develop a similar plan for the entire Northeast region.
We all rely on a strong food and agriculture industry.
By preserving our farmland and helping our farmers achieve economic success, we can retain our farms and the quality of life in our communities, and position the industry for a bright future.
