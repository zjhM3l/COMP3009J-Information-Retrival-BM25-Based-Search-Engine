CHESTERFIELD COUNTY Pr ov i d i n g a F I RST C HO I C E C o m m u n i t y Th r o u g h E xc e l l e n c e i n Pu b l i c S e r v i c e Parks and Recreation Program Guide Autumn 2003 (804) 748-1623 TDD (804) 748-1127 chesterfield.gov From the Director's Desk Partner.
The word evokes many possibilities.
In a business relationship, partners have an equal stake in the viability of a company.
Whether an organization has two partners, or 200, each one brings to the table unique contributions of talent and resources.
They work as a team to achieve success.
And share in its rewards.
In government, partnering is becoming just as crucial.
In recent years, Chesterfield County Parks and Recreation has been fortunate to develop mutually beneficial relationships with an ever-increasing array of partners, from volunteer sports leagues to corporations to associations such as Chesterfield Friends of the Riverfront.
The Manchester YMCA is one local organization entering the partnership arena to fill a recreational interest recently identified by teens throughout the county.
After Parks and Recreation received repeated requests from youths for a skateboard park, we explored the scope of the project in terms of site location, costs, insurance and maintenance.
The Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors allocated matching funds for the project.
To our delight, as well as that of teens throughout the county, the YMCA raised the matching funds and will construct the facility on the old tennis courts at its Hull Street Road site.
It should open in early autumn.
As other citizen concerns and needs emerge in the future, Parks and Recreation looks forward to responding with innovative new partnerships, including future partnerships for additional skateboard facilities throughout the county.
Mike Golden Director, Chesterfield County Parks and Recreation The mission of the Chesterfield County Parks and Recreation Department is to provide a comprehensive system of leisure programs, educational opportunities and recreational facilities for all of its citizens while conserving and protecting environmental, historical and cultural resources.
We will promote community involvement in developing and providing leisure services.
The department will ensure customer service excellence, affordability, equal opportunity, a safe environment and access for all citizens.
