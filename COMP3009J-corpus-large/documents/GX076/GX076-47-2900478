9(1): 70-76.
January-February 1986.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy, ease of operation, and cost of five self-monitoring blood glucose meters.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Patient management.
Methodology: Statistical analysis.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: For four of the five meters, adjusted blood glucose values were not significantly different from laboratory values.
Various advantages and disadvantages were found relative to price, calibration, strip utilization, and ease of operation.
RECOMMENDATION: Patient education is absolutely necessary for accurate use of the blood glucose meters.
ABSTRACT: The authors assessed five kinds of currently marketed meters for home use: Accu-Chek (Bio-Dynamics, Inc.); Glucochek II bG (Medistron/Larken), with Chemstrip bG reagent strips; Glucochek II-Dextro (Medistron/Larken), with Dextrostix reagent strips; two Glucometer (Ames Division, Miles Laboratories) reflectance photometers, with calibration either by fluids or special chips; and Glucoscan II (LifeScan, Inc.).
Fasting blood samples were taken from patients (n = 37) at the University of Kansas College of Health Sciences and Hospital and tested immediately on the meters.
Blood samples were also taken to the laboratory for serum testing according to the glucose-oxidase method.
When unadjusted meter readings of whole blood glucose were plotted against laboratory values, three of the meters had a 35-49 percent inaccuracy rate; for the other two, inaccuracy rates were 65 and 70 percent.
After adjustment of the whole blood glucose values to match the serum values, only the Glucochek II-Dextro with Dextrostix reagent strips had significantly different values.
(A technical revision by the manufacturers may have changed this meter's performance.)
For blood glucose ranges of both 60-180 mg/dL and 181-300 mg/dL, all meters except Glucoscan II were at least 95 percent accurate.
For values of 301-400 mg/dL, both the Glucometer (with "CHIP" calibration) and the Glucoscan II were less than 95 percent accurate.
Prices approximated $150 for the Accu-Chek and the Glucometers, $140 for the Glucochek models, and $178 for the Glucoscan II; 404 to 704 for reagent strips.
The Glucoscan II and the two Glucochek models were factory calibrated; the other models required periodic recalibration.

TITLE: Conference Report: Approaches to the Treatment of Type II Diabetes and Developments in Glucose Monitoring and Insulin Administration.
Bloomgarden, Z.T. Diabetes Care.
19(8): 906-909.
August 1996.
OBJECTIVE: To review presentations at conferences held in 1996 concerning treatment of type 2 diabetes and developments in glucose monitoring systems and insulin administration.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Patient management.
Methodology: Conference summary.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: None.
RECOMMENDATION: None.
ABSTRACT: The author reviews 1996 conference presentations concerning treatment of type 2 diabetes, glucose monitoring, and insulin administration.
In 1992, medical costs for diabetes were 12 percent of total health care costs, but only 8 percent of patient visits were to diabetes specialists.
For each 1 percent fall in hemoglobin A1c (HbA[1C]), development of proliferative retinopathy and nephropathy falls 50 percent.
Diet and exercise are effective in controlling blood glucose and in decreasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Elizabeth Barrett-Connor suggested that achieving glycemic control is not a key to decreasing mortality.
A speaker on managed care stated that protocol-based care is needed, and that outcomes and costs should be followed.
Researchers in England are looking at the effect that controlling blood glucose and hypertension has on outcome for patients with type 2 diabetes.
A new study of the effects of obesity and exercise on development of type 2 diabetes is about to start.
According to one speaker, Julio Santiago, most self-glucose monitoring is a waste of money.
He indicated that an annual investment of $2,000 per patient would decrease mortality substantially in patients with diabetes (supporting data are available).
Santiago proposed that therapeutic programs use algorithms based on the HbA[1C], the fasting blood glucose value, and the avoidance of hypoglycemia.
Another speaker stated that home blood glucose meters are inaccurate, especially at glucose concentrations less than 75 mg/dL.
An implantable insulin pump was found to decrease blood glucose and HbA[1C], but infections, mechanical failures, and cost were problems.
Inhalation, trans-dermal delivery, and sonophoresis are being investigated, as is the use of computer programs for records management and treatment advice.

9(1): 1-10.
January-February 1986.
OBJECTIVE: To assess, in the context of a randomized clinical trial, the impact of an education program for adult patients with diabetes.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Randomized clinical trial.
Methodology: Statistical analysis.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: Patients in the intervention education group made lasting changes in skills and self-care behavior and achieved modest improvement in glycemic control.
RECOMMENDATION: More research in similar and different settings is needed to determine whether the patients from this study are truly representative of patients with type 2 diabetes.
ABSTRACT: The authors report the results of the Diabetes Education Study (DIABEDS) developed by the Indiana University School of Medicine.
The DIABEDS is a randomized, controlled trial of patient and physician education in managing diabetes.
The 532 patients recruited from a clinic population into the study were primarily elderly, female, black, and obese; 95 percent had type 2 diabetes.
Patients could be assigned to intervention groups (patient education, physician plus patient education) or control groups (control group, physician education group).
Staff were randomly assigned to care groups.
Patients in the intervention groups (n = 263) received interactive instruction over an 8-week period on diabetes and its complications, use of medications, the effects of diet and exercise, foot care, urine testing, and behavior modification; they also received meal plans and menus as well as a home visit.
Patients in the control groups (n = 269) received the standard institutional patient education.
Patients were assessed at entry into the study and at postintervention periods ranging from 6 to 14 months.
Two hundred seventy-five patients took part in postintervention assessment.
On most knowledge items, there was little difference between intervention and control groups; intervention patients did better in listing causes of hyperglycemia, knowledge of urine test implications, and knowing the diabetes exchange list system.
Intervention patients were significantly better on two of four urine testing skills as well as on food partitioning and/or weighing.
In addition, they made more improvement in fasting glucose concentrations, glycosylated hemoglobin, body weight, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and serum creatinine concentrations.
Intervention patients also had statistically better diet compliance and safety habits.

TITLE: Effect of Diabetes Education on Self-Care Metabolic Control and Emotional Well-Being.
Flack, J.R. Diabetes Care.
13(10): 1094.
October 1990.
OBJECTIVE: To rebut the assertion by Rubin et al.
(Diabetes Care.
12:673-679.
1989) that educational programs with a few sessions spread over a long time period are probably less effective than a program of 5 consecutive days.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Patient management.
Methodology: Statistical analysis.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: Diabetes education programs that spread the education process over a period of time (up to 6 weeks) may be more effective than five consecutive-day programs.
RECOMMENDATION: Future studies on diabetes programs need to focus on who should teach what, when and how it should be taught, and how to assess outcome.
ABSTRACT: The author questions the contention of Rubin et al. that educational interventions for persons with diabetes that consist of a few sessions spread over a long period will probably be less effective than the 5 consecutive-day program of Rubin et al.
A study presented by Beeney et al. (1988) at the 13th International Diabetes Federation meeting compared four diabetes education programs over 3 years.
At 12 months after entry, knowledge improvement was independent of the program format.
Psychological adjustment was better in patients for whom the program was prolonged for up to 6 weeks.
Beeney et al. concluded that the demonstrated benefits of extended formats must be rationalized with the size and requirements of the population served to determine the most cost-effective program.
They noted that shorter programs have higher patient turnover.
The author suggests that diabetes education needs more study in terms of who is to teach what, when and how it should be taught, and how to assess a suitable outcome.
In a reply, Rubin et al. agree that extended education programs can be effective.
They state that the content and time devoted to teaching are the most important factors in a program, but they indicate that the point of diminishing return for the amount of education has not been identified.
They recommend that future studies seek to identify the content and format that produce the best results.

TITLE: Effect of Diabetes Education on Self-Care, Metabolic Control, and Emotional Well-Being.
Rubin, R.R.; Peyrot, M.; Saudek, C.D. Diabetes Care.
12(10): 673-679.
November-December 1989.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intensive comprehensive educational program will improve emotional well-being, self-care practices, and metabolic control in patients with diabetes.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Prospective trial.
Methodology: Statistical analysis.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: An intensive comprehensive educational program improves emotional well-being, self-care practices, and metabolic control, especially in patients whose functional status in these areas is poor.
RECOMMENDATION: Randomized, controlled studies are needed to assess more definitively the effectiveness of diabetes education programs.
ABSTRACT: Participants (n = 165) in this study at the Johns Hopkins Diabetes Center were enrolled in a week-long outpatient diabetes education program designed to improve self-care practices, emotional well-being, and metabolic control.
The study population was 70 percent white, mean age was 47.4 " 16.5 years, and 59 percent had some college education; most participants were overweight.
Sixty-three percent were taking insulin, and 62 percent had type 2 diabetes.
Disease complications in the study group included neuropathies, retinopathy, vascular complications, and infections.
Baseline data were collected on emotional status, self-care behaviors, diabetes knowledge levels, and glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c tests (HbA[1C]).
One hundred twenty-four (75 percent) of the participants completed a 6-month follow-up questionnaire, and 71 (43 percent) had HbA[1C] tests at 6-month follow-up.
At both program end and 6-month follow-up, participants had significantly improved from baseline on all measures of emotional well-being as well as on knowledge.
At 6 months (versus baseline), bingeing was lower (p 
Program effects were unrelated to demographic or disease characteristics but were strongly related to initial status.
On six different measures, participants who entered the program in the worst condition improved the most; those who entered in the best condition improved little, if at all.

TITLE: The Effectiveness of Diabetes Education for Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetic Persons.
Scott, R.S.; Beaven, D.W.; Stafford, J.M. Diabetes Educator.
10(1): 36-39.
Spring 1984.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a patient education program for patients with type 2 diabetes in improving their understanding and management of the disease and their use of hospital and specialist services.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Randomized clinical trial.
Methodology: Statistical analysis.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: The patient education program did not result in sustained improvement in glycemic control or long-term behavior change.
RECOMMENDATION: The effectiveness of any education program for people with type 2 diabetes should be carefully assessed, as considerable investment of time by health professionals may not result in substantial benefits.
ABSTRACT: This two-part study was carried out at the Christchurch Diabetes Center in New Zealand.
In the first part, individuals with type 2 diabetes were referred to a diabetes education program where they were randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 32) or control (n = 28) group.
The treatment group entered an education program immediately, while the control group entered it four weeks later.
Researchers assessed participants' knowledge and anxiety levels and glycemic control at the time of referral and 4 weeks later, before the control group had begun the education program.
At the latter time, assessment indices (plasma glucose; urinary glucose; glycosylated hemoglobin; and knowledge, anxiety, and depression levels) in the control group showed no significant improvement except for a small increase in the knowledge score (p 
In the treatment group, knowledge (p 
Comparison of improvement in the control and treatment groups found significant differences in favor of the treatment group for knowledge, plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and anxiety.
In the second part of the study, 30 patients received education at referral and 26 patients received education after a 4-week delay.
Glycemic control was assessed at referral, at the end of the program, and 4 weeks after the program's completion.
In both groups, the mean values for blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were not significantly different 4 weeks after program conclusion from the values at referral.

TITLE: Effects of Educational Interventions in Diabetes Care: A Meta-Analysis of Findings.
Brown, S.A. Nursing Research.
37(4): 223-230.
July-August 1988.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of educating patients with diabetes on their knowledge, self-care behavior, and metabolic control.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Formal meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
Methodology: Statistical analysis.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: Patient education has positive outcomes in adults with diabetes.
RECOMMENDATION: More research is needed to develop the statistical basis for meta-analysis, and researchers must make data available in a form that permits comparisons with other studies.
ABSTRACT: The author used meta-analysis to explore several issues: What is the magnitude of the effect of patient teaching in adults with diabetes? What outcomes from teaching in this population have been documented in terms of patient knowledge, self-care, and metabolic control? Is there a relationship between outcome effects and various study characteristics (e.g., research design, type of instruction)? Data were derived from published and unpublished sources; studies had to have a control group (n = 27) or a preintervention control phase (n = 20) for comparison of results.
Studies had been published between 1954 and 1986 (50 percent after 1982).
The studies included 3,605 patients (range: 8 to 373), 236 effect sizes, and 52 pooled effect sizes.
(An effect size is the difference between the experimental and control group in standard score form.)
The author found that patient teaching appears to enhance patient outcomes in diabetes management; she determined that the weighted mean effect size across all studies was 0.33 (i.e., outcomes that are 0.33 standard deviation units higher than those for the comparison group).
The effect of teaching on patient knowledge was moderate to large; on skill performance it was small to low-moderate.
There was a small effect of teaching on weight loss and a large effect on dietary compliance.
Teaching also had a positive effect on metabolic control.
The only study characteristic to be correlated with overall weighted mean effect size was attrition.

TITLE: Evaluating the Costs and Benefits of Outpatient Diabetes Education and Nutrition Counseling.
Kaplan, R.M.; Davis, W.K. Diabetes Care.
9(1): 81-86.
January-February 1986.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the studies that supported the resolution of the American Diabetes Association recommending third party payment for outpatient education and nutrition counseling of patients with diabetes.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Patient management.
Methodology: Review of studies.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: The reports cited by the American Diabetes Association in support of third party reimbursement for outpatient education and nutrition counseling of patients with diabetes do not meet criteria to measure benefits and rarely include the full costs of such programs.
RECOMMENDATION: The first criterion for evaluating education and nutrition counseling should be evidence that they improve health status.
Scientifically sound experiments evaluating education of patients with diabetes should be undertaken.
ABSTRACT: The authors analyzed the scientific validity of 13 studies cited by the American Diabetes Association in support of its recommendation for third party coverage of outpatient education and nutrition counseling of patients with diabetes.
Only two of the reports mentioned control or comparison groups, and in neither case were the patients randomly assigned to such groups.
Only four studies provided health care cost accounting, and two of these studies did not include the intervention costs.
Some of the studies seemed to show an increase in costs with intervention.
None of the studies included discount analyses and most failed to report net differences in costs.
Some studies did not report costs of related services or program implementation costs.
In some cases, apparent savings were in fact cost shifting, which may not equate to cost reduction.
None of the studies estimated indirect patient costs, such as travel time, changes in diet, and lost work.
Only one study reported costs of medications and educational materials.
Costs of continuing intervention were not estimated.
Attrition was high in the five studies that reported it, and follow-up was nonexistent or not reported in half of the studies.
Researchers extrapolated limited results nationwide, and the programs varied widely.
None of the reports meets accepted criteria to establish the cause and effect of education intervention.
Well-designed experiments are needed to assess the direct and indirect program costs, the savings attributable to the program, and the net program benefits.
Costs must be based on all patients who receive service, adequate patient follow-up, and discounted future benefits.

TITLE: Evaluation of a Structured Treatment and Teaching Program for Non-Insulin-Treated Type II Diabetic Outpatients in Germany after the Nationwide Introduction of Reimbursement Policy for Physicians.
Gruesser, M.; Bott, U.; Ellermann, P.; Kronsbein, P.; Joergens, V. Diabetes Care.
16(9): 1268-1275.
September 1993.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the practicability and efficacy of a structured treatment and teaching program for patients with type 2 diabetes in a routine primary care office setting.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Patient management.
Methodology: Cost analysis.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: The structured treatment and teaching program improved the quality of care, as evidenced by decreased patient weight, less use of oral antidiabetic agents, and improved metabolic control.
RECOMMENDATION: The participating physicians recommended a higher reimbursement rate for providing a structured treatment and patient education program for their type 2 diabetes patients.
ABSTRACT: In 1991, nationwide insurance coverage of a standard treatment and teaching program for outpatients with type 2 diabetes was introduced in Germany.
Physicians' fees and the costs of teaching materials were reimbursed.
Physicians and office staff were required to complete a training course to obtain reimbursement.
The authors interviewed 127 office-based physicians in Hamburg who had completed the training course (42 percent were internists and 58 percent were general practitioners) 12 months after the training, and information was collected on 179 patients who participated in group treatment and teaching programs, which were provided in 17 randomly selected office practices.
Of the 127 physicians, 122 (96 percent) rated the training course content as good and useful, 2 reported they learned nothing new, and 3 rated the content as useless or poor.
Sixty-one percent of the physicians had implemented at least one treatment and teaching course in their practice at the time of the evaluation (median: 12 months after completing the training course).
Information on patients completing the program showed substantial improvements in quality of treatment and self-care practices.
The number of patients who tested their urine for glucose at least twice a week rose from 3 percent to 70 percent.
Improved dietary habits led to a reduction in body weight, which resulted in decreased use of oral antidiabetic agents and improved metabolic control.
The net cost for the program was $35.80 (U.S. dollars) per patient in year 1, with an expected savings of $13.20 per patient per year beginning in year 2.
These savings do not include anticipated reductions in the costs associated with treating long-term complications of diabetes.
Most of the physicians found reimbursement for offering the program to be either "extremely inadequate"or "inadequate."

TITLE: Obesity and the U.S. Navy [letter]
Yowell, S.K. Military Medicine.
156(12): A10.
December 1991.
OBJECTIVE: To show that the authors of an earlier article (Hoiberg, A.; McNally, M.S. Military Medicine.
156(2): 76-82 [abstract 222]) did not provide support for the Health and Physical Readiness Program of the U.S. Navy.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Patient management.
Methodology: Review of study.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: The referenced authors' support for the Navy's Health and Physical Readiness Program was not justified by their study.
RECOMMENDATION: A weight control program's efficacy, potential benefits, and adverse effects should be examined, as should its cost of screening and monitoring.
ABSTRACT: This letter to the editor offers several criticisms of Hoiberg and McNally's article on overweight patients in the U.S. Navy.
The author points out that obesity was not defined in Hoiberg and McNally's article and that data were obtained from sources that did not verify diagnoses.
Furthermore, the control group was not age-matched with the obese group.
The author also questions diagnoses of gout, hypertension, gallbladder disorders, and diabetes on admissions of obese patients.
He points out that admissions for a diagnosis like diabetes are more likely to have obesity mentioned in the workup than are admissions for diagnoses where weight is thought to be irrelevant.
Referring to the authors' finding of a high concordance of alcoholism and obesity, the writer notes that during the study period almost all obesity therapy was offered by alcohol rehabilitation staff; a co-diagnosis of alcoholism was often needed to gain admission.
Before implementing weight control programs and examining their potential savings in hospitalization, he suggests looking at their efficacy, potential benefit, adverse effects, and the cost of screening and monitoring.

TITLE: A Randomized Study of the Effects of a Home Diabetes Education Program.
Rettig, B.A.; Shrauger, D.G.; Recker, R.R.; Gallagher, T.F.; Wiltse, H. Diabetes Care.
9(2): 173-178.
March-April 1986.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a home-based individualized instruction program in diabetes.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Randomized clinical trial.
Methodology: Statistical analysis.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: Six months following enrollment, patients in the intervention group (home teaching) had significantly greater knowledge and skill scores than the control group (no teaching).
Hospitalization rates, diabetes-related emergency room visits, physician visits, and sick days did not differ significantly by group at 12-month follow-up.
RECOMMENDATION: Because diabetes is a chronic disease, new guidelines for diabetes patient education should incorporate a long-term management plan in conjunction with periodic reinforcement of self-care knowledge and skills.
ABSTRACT: In this Nebraska-based study, home health nurses provided up to 12 educational visits for 193 patients randomly assigned to the intervention group.
The 180 patients in the control group, while not receiving home visits, were free to participate in other types of health education.
The two groups did not vary in terms of demographic composition, diabetes duration, diabetes type, or previous diabetes education.
A survey instrument developed by the Nebraska Diabetes Demonstration Project was used to measure self-care knowledge and skills.
At 6-month follow-up, total mean knowledge scores were 60.2 for the intervention group, 51.6 for controls (p = 0.001); total mean skill scores were 74.8 for the intervention group and 72.6 for controls, a difference that was statistically significant (p = 0.04) but not considered meaningful.
At 12-month follow-up, hospitalization rates did not differ by group on any of three types of admission: nondiabetes-related, nonpreventable diabetes-related, and preventable diabetes-related.
There was no difference between the groups in mean foot appearance score at 6-month follow-up.
The authors warn of possible bias in the selection of study participants, as those who chose to participate may have been more highly motivated than those who did not (about 70 percent of patients who were asked to participate actually did).
Such a bias could have resulted in recruiting patients for whom teaching would have added little to present knowledge and skill levels.
In addition, persons hospitalized with a diabetes-related condition were more likely to have been identified as eligible to participate than those hospitalized with a condition not overtly related to diabetes.

TITLE: Reduced Hospital Utilization and Cost Savings Associated with Diabetes Patient Education.
Sinnock, P. Journal of Insurance Medicine.
18(3): 24-30.
Summer 1986.
OBJECTIVE: To review data demonstrating the impact of patient education programs on health care services used by patients with diabetes; to review the system for assuring the quality of such programs and the current status of reimbursement by third party payers for diabetes outpatient education.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Patient management.
Methodology: Review of studies.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: Diabetes patient education programs can dramatically reduce the physical and economic costs of diabetes.
RECOMMENDATION: The insurance industry and diabetes community should work together to monitor and improve diabetes patient education programs.
ABSTRACT: Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between diabetes patient education and reduction in hospitalizations, resulting in cost savings.
A 2-year study of 6,000 persons with diabetes who participated in a patient education program at Los Angeles County Hospital demonstrated a 73 percent decrease in hospitalizations; cost savings over the study period were estimated at $1.8 million.
A program at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta showed a 65 percent decrease in admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis and an estimated savings of $3.5 million over 8 years.
In Maine, a Centers for Disease Control state-based program demonstrated a 32 percent reduction in hospitalizations among 1,000 participants, with net savings estimated at $293 per participant per year.
A 51 percent reduction in hospitalization from diabetic acidosis and infection and a 63 percent reduction in emergency room visits were seen in a Rhode Island program.
Estimated cost savings associated with this intervention were $355 per participant per year.
The quality of diabetes education programs in the United States has varied, but it is hoped that the implementation of the National Standards for Diabetes Patient Education Programs (National Diabetes Advisory Board 1983) will improve this situation.
Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield and selected private insurers reimburse for outpatient education in 14 states, Medicare in 15 states, and Medicaid in 6 states.
Several states are considering legislation that would mandate coverage for self-management education programs for diabetes outpatients.

TITLE: Third Party Reimbursement for Diabetes Mellitus: Outpatient Education: A Year's Progress.
Peddicord, M.; Lyons, A.; Tobin, C.; Vinicor, F. Diabetes Spectrum.
3(1): 9-12.
January-February 1990.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the progress made in obtaining third party reimbursement for outpatient education programs for patients with diabetes.
CATEGORY: Secondary intervention.
Type of Study: Patient management.
Methodology: Survey.
Perspective: Health care system.
CONCLUSION: Between 1986 and 1989, the number of states reporting reimbursement for diabetes outpatient education increased.
Medicare reimbursement increased because of a national policy statement from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).
An increase in private insurer reimbursement is credited to consumer demand and Medicare policies.
There was little change in Medicaid programs.
RECOMMENDATION: Continued consumer advocacy, emphasis on quality, providing additional cost and cost-savings information, and ongoing exploration of strategies and alternatives are recommended to continue the progress made in reimbursement policies.
ABSTRACT: Reimbursement for outpatient education programs for patients with diabetes is increasing across the United States.
Four states have enacted legislation covering reimbursement of these programs.
Medicare reimbursement has increased for outpatient education programs because of a national policy statement issued by the HCFA defining Medicare's criteria for reimbursement of prevention, including diabetes education.
Private insurers, including HMOs, have shown the greatest increase in third party reimbursement for outpatient education programs, primarily because of consumer demand and Medicare policies.
Medicaid programs, which are regulated by the states, have shown the least change toward third party reimbursement.
Among many insurers there is an acceptance of education as a part of treatment, and not solely as a preventive measure.
Most reimbursed outpatient education programs are either hospital-based or based in rural health clinics.
Programs formally recognized by an accrediting or recognition body at the state or national level are more likely to be reimbursed.
Concerns regarding reimbursement for outpatient education for patients with diabetes include the fact that only one or two education programs per state currently receive reimbursement, that the prospective payment system is causing more programs to shift from an inpatient to outpatient setting, and that little progress has been made in reimbursement for free-standing education programs.
