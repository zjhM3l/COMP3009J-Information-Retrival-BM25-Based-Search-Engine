[ars150.gif] TEKTRAN __________________________________________________________________ COLEOSPORIUM HELIANTHI - ANOTHER RUST DISEASE OF SUNFLOWER Author(s): GULYA JR THOMAS J Interpretive Summary: Sunflower is prone to the rust disease caused by the fungus Puccinia helianthi worldwide.
Another rust fungus, Coleosporium, was recently observed on Jerusalem artichoke, a relative of cultivated sunflower, in Georgia.
The Coleosporium rust requires two hosts to complete its life cycle - a two-needled pine and any Helianthus (sunflower) species.
A sample of Coleosporium was used to determine its host range on cultivated sunflower.
Nearly all sunflower breeding lines and commercial hybrids were immune to Coleosporium rust, and the sunflower's reaction to Coleosporium was not related to its response to the other rust (Puccinia).
Coleosporium rust does not appear to be a threat to cultivated sunflower, but Jerusalem artichoke and other sunflowers grown as ornamentals can be highly susceptible.
