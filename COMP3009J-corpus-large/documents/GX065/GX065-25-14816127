Confounded by Frogs
Deformed-Frog Meeting is Short on Answers, Long on Speculation

After David Hoppe concluded a slide-lecture presentation before a conference of about 75 scientists, one member of the audience approached him and said: "Boy, those slides of yours sure have me stumped!"
Hoppe, a herpetologist and biology professor at the University of Minnesota-Morris, showed picture after picture of deformed frogs that he collected in west-central Minnesota in 1996.
Some frogs had missing or partial legs; others were hideously deformed.
Some had legs poking out from the middle of their bodies.
Still others had legs encumbered by excessive skin.
Hoppe has collected thousands of frogs since 1976 but had noticed only a couple of deformities until last year, when he began to see them by the dozens, and in eight different species.
He won't speculate about the cause of the deformities, except to say that they appear to be more frequent in such species as mink and leopard frogs that spend most of their lives in water.
Some blame parasites
Others at the conference at Shenandoah National Park in Virginia proposed explanations for frog deformities and claimed that more research will prove them correct.
Stan Sessions, a biologist at Hartwick College in New York, said most of the frog deformities in Minnesota and elsewhere have natural causes, including viruses, predators and parasites.
The parasites live for part of their life cycle in pond snails, Sessions said, and are released in time to invade tadpoles, burrow into their bodies to become cysts, and disrupt normal development of legs.
"In some cases there are so many cysts that they prohibit one side of the frog from growing at all," he said; in other cases the cysts that block normal limb growth cause extra legs to sprout.
Under questioning from other scientists, Sessions admitted that there is no evidence for his theory, except for some lab work in the late 1980s where plastic implants in California frogs caused extra legs to sprout.
Hoppe bristled at Sessions' notion that most Minnesota frog deformities can be explained largely as the result of predation or other trauma.
He said his research sites have few if any turtles or fish that might eat frogs or snails that might carry parasites.
"If the cause is natural, show me why we haven't ever noticed this number of deformities before," he said.
Kathy Converse, wildlife biologist for the National Wildlife Health Research Center in Madison, Wis., said lab analysis from about 50 Minnesota frogs, most of them with deformities, has shown no unusual viruses, bacteria or parasites.
But she said the sample size is too small to definitely rule out parasites.
Converse said analysis of Minnesota frogs did provide one surprise: A few of the frogs, including one that appeared to be normal on the outside, showed unusual formations in their spines and lower jaw bones, including cartilage that seemed disorganized and oddly developed.
The finding, if seen in more cases, raises questions about whether Minnesota frogs have numerous internal deformities that might provide other clues about what's causing the problems.
University of Minnesota scientists are studying organs of some deformed frogs but have not released their findings.
The Case For Chemicals
Another line of research suggests that chemicals may be causing some of the deformities.
Malcolm Maden, professor of developmental biology at Kings College in London, said there is a "striking similarity" between frogs with extra limbs from Minnesota and frogs that he has induced to grow extra limbs in studies that involve retinoic acid.
What may be happening, he said, is that some manmade chemical similar to retinoic acid is causing those deformities.
Ken Muneoka, professor of cell and molecular biology at Tulane University in New Orleans, said scientists know a lot about how limbs develop and that there are strong similarities in that respect among frogs, mice and many other vertebrates, including humans.
Muneoka said that some studies have shown that chemicals, including at least one pesticide, can mimic the body's naturally occurring chemicals and send false signals that result in abnormal development.
Andrew Blaustein, ecology professor at Oregon State University, said the sun's ultraviolet radiation may be a contributing factor to frog deformities, but he has not studied the issue.
He and a team of researchers have found that extra radiation because of the thinning atmospheric ozone layer is killing or damaging eggs of several frog species on the West coast.
Although no connections have been made, Blaustein said he's beginning to wonder whether radiation may have anything to do with eye deformities found in some of the Minnesota frogs.
Hillary Carpenter, a toxicologist for the Minnesota Department of Health, said that investigation of certain chemicals should be a top priority.
"What's driving this whole issue is not deformed frogs," he said.
"It's the potential for effects on human health."
Priorities for funding became an issue at the conference, and several biologists argued that more money should be provided to determine whether the clusters of frog deformities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont and Quebec represent more widespread occurrences in North America.
Minnesota Data Criticized
Martin Ouellet, a consultant for the Canadian Wildlife Service from McGill University in Montreal, has collected thousands of frogs in the past few years and has documented the highest rates of deformities in agricultural areas that have been treated with pesticides.
Ouellet, who expects to add 60 more sites to his large study area in the St. Lawrence River Valley in 1997, was critical of Minnesota's research.
"I don't think Minnesota has good data," he said.
"It means nothing."
States need to conduct a broad-based random survey to determine specific numbers of normal and abnormal frogs, he said.
"I'm surprised that the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency [MPCA] is not here at this conference," Ouellet said, noting that it is largely because of Minnesota that frogs have begun to receive national attention in the United States.
Judy Helgen, MPCA wetlands biologist, said from her St. Paul office that she and others could not attend the conference because they're preparing to begin field research in the next week or two.
She said the MPCA was set back in its research when a lab it hired to do some of the analysis declared bankruptcy and a new contract had to be arranged.
She said that some of her findings from 1996 should be available this summer.
Other state researchers are expected to release information in the next few months.
