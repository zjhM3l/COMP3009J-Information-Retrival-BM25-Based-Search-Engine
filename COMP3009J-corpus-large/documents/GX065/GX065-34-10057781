Searching For Clues
A Closer Look at the Frogs and the Research

Did you know that their complex life cycles and habitats make frogs a good barometer of environmental quality?
Frogs are considered to be sensitive indicators of environmental quality because of their unique position in nature.
They have permeable skin, they live in water and air, and they have a complex life cycle in which a large percentage of their body tissues change.
If frogs are having trouble because of pollution, it may be an early sign of potential problems for humans as well.
The Key Question for 1997
Researchers in Minnesota and elsewhere are gearing up to study frogs closely as they emerge from winter dormancy and move to spring breeding ponds.
Scientists are convinced that something has changed recently in the frog's environment, and want to determine whether pollutants, natural diseases or parasites, or some other factors are interfering with normal development.
A key question is when frogs are being affected, so it will be important to study the frogs and their surroundings almost daily during their life cycle.
Northern Leopard Frog
This is the most commonly seen frog in Minnesota and the one in which most deformities have been reported.
The Current Theories
It is not yet known what is causing the abnormalities, but several explanatins have been offered.
It is possible that the different types of deformities observed may have different causes or combinations of causes.
Most researchers expect that it will take several years to sort out what is happening.
Chemicals * Heavy metals or pesticides could be accumulating and affecting eggs or tadpoles.
* Adult frogs may be exposed to chemicals as they move from wintering sites to spring breeding ponds.
* Chemicals also could flow into hatching areas through runoff from nearby fields or by air from distant sources.
Ultraviolet radiation * Some types of UV radiation from the sun can "photoactivate" certain chemicals and transform them from nontoxic to toxic.
* Not a leading theory to explain frog abnormalities, but perhaps a contributing factor.
Parasites + Can burrow into tadpoles during development, forming cysts that interfere with the normal growth of limb buds and cause multiple limbs to sprout.
Viruses and Diseases + Environmental changes may weaken frogs' immune systems and other natural defenses.
The National Scene Citizens and scientists have reported deformed frogs in 185 locations in in Minnesota (26 confirmed), 21 sites in Wisconsin (5 confirmed) and 12 sites in Vermont (4 confirmed).
Smaller numbers of reports have come from a scattering of other states: California, Oregon, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, New York and Texas (salamanders with deformed limbs).
* Total reported sitings of deformed frogs An MPCA database lists deformed frogs in 185 locations in 54 of the state's 87 counties, including 26 sites where abnormalities were confirmed by scientists.
Six incidents were reported from the early 1990s, 13 were reported in 1995, and the rest were called in during 1996.
* Numbers of abnormal frogs per site, 1996 Citizens' reports vary in terms of the amount of information that has been provided.
In many locations, only one deformed frog was found.
In others, the numbers varied from several to dozens.
In most cases, reports do not include estimates of how many healthy frogs were in the surrounding area.
*
Types of deformities Some frogs had missing eyes, but most problems were associated with strange limbs, especially back legs.
The deformities included extra, missing or partial legs, limbs that divided and branched, and unusual spikes or protrusions at the tail end of some frogs.
