Smart Energy Communication Campaign July 14, 2003
The Department of Energy has launched a Smart Energy Communication Campa [energysaver2.gif] ign to help reduce summer demand for electricity.
An increasing amount of electricity generated today is derived from natural gas, and today natural gas supplies in underground storage are lower than they have been at this time during the past five years.
Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham has expressed concern that lower-than-usual reserves going into next winter could result in price spikes.
Therefore, DOE is encouraging the nation's energy consumers to be "energy smart" and apply the latest innovations and technologies to reduce energy consumption...and save money.

House-Senate Energy Conference to Start Tomorrow California lawmaker says comprehensive plan `critical' to economic and national security June 26, 2002
Washington, DC - Rep. George Radanovich (R-CA) today urged the conferees for the Securing America's Future Energy Act (SAFE) to put politics aside and agree on a sound energy plan for the United States.
Radanovich, a member of the Hill Energy Act Team (HEAT), stressed the significance of this legislation for our economic and national security.

Enron memos spur two Senate hearings By David Whitney Sacramento Bee Published 2:15 a.m. PDT Friday, May 10, 2002
WASHINGTON -- Two committees in the U.S. Senate will hold hearings next week into the possible manipulation of last year's California electricity crisis.
The hearings come in the wake of recently released Enron Corp. memos revealing schemes to artificially tighten supplies to drive up prices.

California Republicans Want Justice Dept.
Probe Of Enron National Journal -- Congress Daily AM May 10, 2002
California GOP Reps. Mary Bono and George Radanovich sent a letter Thursday to Attorney General Ashcroft, requesting that the Justice Department investigate whether Enron Corp. manipulated prices during California's energy shortage last year.
The legislators wrote that an investigation is necessary because of new Enron documents uncovered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
They show the company might have contributed to soaring prices and blackouts in the state.

Energy Efficiency, Conservation and Demand Management Washington, DC - Conservation, energy efficiency and demand management are crucial components of a national energy plan.
They are the actions that control one whole side, the need side, of the energy supply and demand equation.
How, when and for what purpose we use energy are just as important as the production of reliable, affordable and environmentally sound energy.

An Energy Interstate Highway System Washington, DC - Just recently, Governor Davis decided not to attend a meeting of the Western Governors Association called to discuss wildfires and energy.
This, when wildfire risk was at its peak, and when the California Manufacturers and Technology Association issued the second edition of its Â³Energy Casualty Report.Â² The Shasta Paper Mill said it will be forced to shut down soon, Libbey Glass in southern California said it too may be forced to shut down permanently, and California Steel Industries is on the casualty watch list.
Good jobs with high pay! And this is not the first meeting he has missed.
In his two and one-half years in office he has attended only one of at least six full-fledged meetings.

Is More CAFE Good for Us? Washington, DC - Some say yes, some say no.
For an impartial and thoughtful answer to this question, Congress turned to the National Academy of Sciences and it just recently responded with its report on July [powerwires.gif] 31, 2001.
Despite its plain black and white cover, and dry technical format, the Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards offers some very informative, and even captivating reading.
I highly recommend it for anyone with a serious, thoughtful interest in learning more about this energy policy issue.
If you canÂ¹t find the time, let me offer you the following highlights.
[readmore.gif] __________________________________________________________________
Environmentalism and Consumerism - A Reasoned Balance Washington, DC - Much has been made by some of Vice President CheneyÂ¹s remarks that energy conservation is in a way a personal virtue, and thus should not be relied on as the primary government sponsored action to address our nationÂ¹s energy needs.
At the core of his observation, though, is a question that should be of great interest to all of us, which is: How much and how far should our governments go to motivate, force, or limit individual choices and behavior.
After all, our nation is founded on the principles of individual freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Government intervention against those principles must be careful and limited, if it cannot be avoided.

Stewardship of Our Federal Lands Washington, DC - The people of California, the media, the special interest groups, and the politicians, and that includes me, are now talking more about energy than we have in a decade.
One of the issues foremost in the debate is making responsible use of the resources that can be found on the federal lands of which we are stewards.
This is because among the factors making it difficult to increase domestic energy production are the limitations on access to federal lands with high potential for new discoveries.
[readmore.gif] __________________________________________________________________
Technology and Energy Washington, DC - The PresidentÂ¹s goal of reliable, affordable and environmentally sound energy will call forth innovations in science, research, and engineering.
It is an opportunity for enterprising young students at Cal State - Fresno, and throughout our state high schools and universities, to become involved in building our nationÂ¹s energy future.
The energy crisis is a call to put to good use the talents within us, and offers the best rewards - in new jobs, a healthier environment, a stronger economy, and a brighter future for our young people.
AmericaÂ¹s energy strength lies in its technological leadership.
[readmore.gif] __________________________________________________________________
An Alternative Energy Choice Washington, DC - Our seasons change subtly in California, but it is still important to consider the passing of the year, to reflect on how we have fared, and plan for our future.
Last winter brought us panic as the electricity crisis came upon us.
Spring brought anger at the little control we had over the precarious position in which we were put.
Summer brought us dread of frequent blackouts, which luckily we seem to have avoided.
But now it is late summer, Fall is upon us and it is time to turn to the question of where things should go from here.
We cannot pretend this was just one big nightmare, a bad year, and that a return to the good old days somehow simply lies ahead.
[readmore.gif] __________________________________________________________________
A Better Choice for Energy Washington, DC - There appear to be some breaks forming in the storm clouds of CaliforniaÂ¹s electricity crisis.
An important, hopeful sign is the GovernorÂ¹s recent statement that it's in our best interests to have the most knowledgeable, expert people buying power, not to have the state consuming all its time and energy and resources to do this work.
Something I have been saying for some time.
Get the State out of the power business, restore the utilities credit, and transfer the StateÂ¹s financial commitments to provide energy back to the private sector.
Public officials are no match for savvy power-industry executives in a competitive market place and the State cannot guarantee lower rates by building its own power plants.

Energy Policy Principles * Affordable, reliable and sufficient energy resources are necessary for the continued enhancement of the standard of living of all Americans.
* Energy must be used wisely.
* Consumers choice reflecting individual need, is superior to government mandates concerning your use of energy.
* America must responsibly develop its own resources and not exploit the resources of the other nations.
* Federal action should be focused on removing "man-made" barriers harmful to consumers.
This includes maximizing the efficiency of the policy-making and regulatory processes.
* There is no clear choice between limiting demand or increasing supply.
Action on both fronts is essential.
* Energy is a ubiquitous issue that must be considered by all agencies in their decision making.
Radanovich Blasts Davis for Playing Wall Street with Taxpayer Dollars
Washington, DC - Rep. George Radanovich (R-CA) blasted Governor Gray Davis this afternoon as reports revealed that state officials have been selling surplus power for outrageous losses to the taxpayer.
The Man Standing with Money in Hand San Jose Mercury News reported today that power contracts averaging $138 per megawatt-hour are being sold for as little as $1 per megawatt-hour.
"This is one of the most obscene examples of incompetence I have ever seen," Radanovich said.
"California taxpayers continue to suffer at the hands of this governor and, unfortunately, they will pay for his missteps for years to come."

Opening ANWR, Increasing Supply Critical to Energy Independence and National Security
Washington, DC - Rep. George Radanovich (R-CA), a member of both the Resources and Energy and Commerce Committees, will urge his colleagues today to accept ANWR exploration provisions in the Energy Security Act.
The Resources Committee will convene at 2:00 PM EST to markup the legislation and report it to the full House of Representatives.
"We cannot conserve our way out of this supply problem," Radanovich said.
"While conservation is an integral part of a comprehensive energy plan, it would be a grave mistake to overlook the fact that our nation's supplies have not increased proportionately with population and demand.
In fact, they really have not increased at all.
In many cases, they have declined, which increases our heavy dependence on foreign countries for our energy needs."

Radanovich Hails Passage of Landmark Energy Conservation Legislation -- Committee Overwhelmingly Approves Measure on Bipartisan 50-5 Vote
Washington, DC - House Energy and Commerce Committee member George Radanovich (R-CA) is calling today's overwhelming approval of a sweeping energy conservation package "a giant step towards updating America's national energy policies."
The Energy and Commerce Committee today approved "The Energy Advancement and Conservation Act of 2001" - which among other things reduces light truck fuel consumption by 5 billion gallons over six years; provides incentives for cleaner energy sources and alternative fuel vehicles; promotes clean coal technologies; simplifies regulation of nuclear and hydroelectric power and reformulated gasoline; increases funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act; and sets stricter standards for energy use in federal buildings - by a resounding, bipartisan vote of 50-to-5.

Radanovich Applauds FERC Decision -- California lawmaker deems market-based solutions to crisis appropriate, arbitrary price caps unsound
Washington, DC - Rep. George Radanovich (R-CA) today announced his support for the Federal Electricity Regulatory Commission's (FERC) bipartisan 5-0 decision to reaffirm its market-based price mitigation measures first issued in April.
The FERC extended the plan to all eleven Western States, and to California on a 24-hour, 7-day per week basis.
"I congratulate Chairman Herbert and all the commissioners for this important decision," Radanovich said.
"It is critical that we, in dealing with this crisis, stick to market based principles in determining the ceiling for electricity pricing.
This is a very positive step in achieving reasonable electricity rates for Californians, and I am pleased that the FERC dismissed the massive misstep known as price-caps." [readmore.gif] ________________________________

Congressman Radanovich Opening Statement on the National Energy Policy Before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality
REP. GEORGE RADANOVICH (R-CA): Thank you, Chairman Barton and Chairman Tauzin for having this hearing.
I want to welcome you again Mr. Secretary (Spencer Abraham, Secretary of Energy).
I look forward to your testimony.
It was mentioned a little bit earlier by someone that ANWR (Artic National Wildlife Refuge) would not solve California's problems.
They are exactly right -- California's problems really are a crisis in state leadership in California.
Although I support drilling in ANWR, that's really more for the long-term interest of our nation, not to solve California's current problem.
I would recommend three things that the Secretary and the Administration can do in order to get California out of their energy crisis.
Number one, suggest that the governor get out of the energy purchasing business.
Number two, focus your efforts on making the utilities creditworthy again so that they can, in turn, be the energy purchaser in the state.
Finally, number three, do what you can to get the utilities out of the spot market.
It was the utilities being forced into the spot market that caused the problem in the first place.
If we get proper leadership in the state of California, if they do those three things, we're out of our problem.
Having said that, there is still the issue of supply in California.
I think energy policy is a lot like environmental policy, in that everybody wants to be green everywhere in the country except their own backyard.
I think the NIMBY attitude, or "not in my backyard," has been the cause of a lot of the nation's energy shortage.
I congratulate you [Secretary Abraham] on taking the leadership and the President on the leadership in developing a policy that makes us more reliant on our own resources and diversifies our base.
Thank you very much for this opportunity to speak.
I look forward to your [Secretary Abraham] testimony and I look forward to your [Secretary Abraham]

Energy Solutions Seek State Leadership
Our daily conversation, our newspapers, our television news, and even our family dinner table conversations are filled with the energy crisis.
Rolling blackouts brought the issue home to some of us earlier this year.
A nine-percent rate increase in retail energy costs got our attention, along with uncapped natural gas price increases.
Our local utility,
PG
We've been told to expect an overall 46 percent retail rate increase, though we don't yet know what this means to us as rate-payers or as consumers.
The Governor promised the energy crisis would be addressed without rate increases deferred meaningful action, and then embraced huge rate increases imposed by the State's Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
The Governor told us all that the problem was "well in hand" last March.
Today we face statewide rolling blackouts and will for the next several months.
The Governor negotiated long term contracts with energy suppliers at the peak of the price curve, ensuring California's ratepayers, and its taxpayers, will be paying for today's energy for many years into the future.
The Governor has done all of this behind closed doors, and has not shared with those paying the bill the cost of contracts for future electricity needs.

Radanovich Appointed to Energy Action Team California Lawmaker Joins Leadership, Committee Chairmen in steering energy policy communication and agenda in House
Washington, DC - Rep. George Radanovich (R-CA) has been appointed to the newly created Energy Action Team assembled by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-TX).
Comprised of House leaders, committee chairmen, and other key members engaged in energy policy debate, the 15-lawmaker group was formed to map a comprehensive energy strategy and communications plan for Republicans.
"I am pleased to be part of the team and anxious to help both the House leadership and the Bush administration ensure that this Congress embraces a coherent energy policy," Radanovich said.
"It is imperative that we become more self-sufficient in the United States and slash our dependence on foreign sources of oil." [readmore.gif] __________________________________________________________________
More Choices, More Chances
On the weekend shows, Governor Davis once again portrayed California as a victim of out-of-state energy companies.
He [violin.gif] claimed that "these out of state generators drove our utilities to the brink of bankruptcy" and that "the energy companies...are playing us like a fiddle."
Well, Governor, it is time that you quit acting like a victim and do what is right for California.
It is time to stop blaming others for your situation and take control.
The energy companies can only play you like a fiddle if you let them.
Gray Davis is responsible for the sixth largest economy in the world.
If things keep going the way they are, he will be presiding over a much less economically viable state.
We can't take many more chances with his lack of leadership.

Radanovich Backs Bush Energy Plan Lawmaker calls on Governor Davis to follow President's leadership in exacting real, comprehensive solutions to crisis.
Washington, DC - Rep. George Radanovich (R-CA) announced his support for President Bush's energy package this morning.
After eight years without a comprehensive national energy policy, Radanovich welcomed the release of the task force report that calls for increased exploration, production, and environmental safeguards.

Radanovich to Davis: Stop Finger Pointing and Start Leading!
Washington, DC - Rep. George Radanovich (R-CA) blasted Governor Gray Davis today for his non-leadership style of assigning blame and pointing fingers as California's energy crisis deepens.
Governor Davis, in his comments following President Bush's release of his energy policy, said "Mr. President, you are the only who can help us," referring to a plea for price controls on wholesale electricity in California.
Rep. Radanovich and President Bush have continually discredited such a plan as economically unwise.
