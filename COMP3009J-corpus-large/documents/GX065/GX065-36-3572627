Emerging research about deformed frogs found in Minnesota and other parts of North America is providing intriguing hints that pesticides or other chemicals may be causing at least part of the problem.
But most scientists agree that it's too early to rule out parasites, viruses and other potential factors.
Since school children found frogs with malformed and missing legs in a southern Minnesota farm pond in 1995, abnormal frogs have been reported in more than 180 Minnesota locations and in scattered places in several other states.
Health officials in Minnesota and elsewhere have begun to monitor the situation in case what's harming amphibians could affect humans as well.
State and federal agencies and universities are scrambling to find research money, and cumulatively have proposed to spend more than $1 million this year on frog collection, analysis and public information in the Upper Midwest.
There have been several recent developments.
A team of Canadian scientists in Quebec has associated likely exposure to pesticides with a large number of frogs with partial or missing legs or digits studied in the St. Lawrence River Valley.
In the latest Journal of Wildlife Diseases, researchers note that in 1992 and 1993 they found deformities in 106 out of 853 frogs collected from 14 farmland areas, primarily ponds and ditches near sweet corn and potato fields.
They found only two deformed frogs out of 271 taken from 12 "pesticide-free" environments.
Martin Ouellet, lead author of the study and consultant for the Canadian Wildlife Service, said more than 10,000 frogs collected in 1995 and 1996 show a similar pattern, but his team has not studied water chemistry of breeding ponds and, therefore, has no scientific proof to link deformities to agricultural chemicals.
"We strongly suspect pesticides," said Ouellet, who has planned a more comprehensive study starting this spring.
Limb deformities in Canada were found in one toad species and three frog species, including the northern leopard frog, which has shown the most frequent abnormalities in Minnesota.
National Wildlife Health Center scientists in Madison, Wis., have found bone, cartilage and jaw deformities in some Minnesota frogs they have analyzed.
Kathy Converse, a wildlife disease specialist at the center, said more frogs need to be studied, but results so far raise the possibility that estimates of the number of deformed frogs may be too low.
"What we don't know is whether there are worse deformities in frogs that don't survive at all and that we never see," she said.
Other diagnostic tests on Minnesota frogs have not linked deformities with naturally occurring diseases, viruses or parasites, she said, but nothing can be ruled out.
A California researcher studying Minnesota frogs has not seen evidence yet that deformities are linked with parasites, as other experts had predicted.
Stephen Goldberg, herpetologist and biology professor at Whittier College, said he has seen mixed results in the 250 normal and deformed Minnesota frogs that he has been analyzing.
"At this point we have found abnormal frogs with parasites, and we have found abnormal frogs without parasites," he said.
"It's too early to pin anything down."
Goldberg and others have raised another possibility: that different categories of problems - such as eye deformities, multiple limbs, internal abnormalities and missing or partial legs - may each have distinct or different combinations of causes.
Preliminary research by a University of Minnesota cell biologist and cancer expert shows major problems in the internal organs of deformed frogs that he collected last summer.
Robert McKinnell, a professor who has studied frogs since 1958, is completing the analysis and will publish the results later this year.
"I can't tell you the significance of this yet, but I predict we will find a syndrome of internal abnormalities for these frogs."
Federal officials are hustling to establish a national reporting center that would collect, analyze and distribute information about deformed frogs.
The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in Jamestown, N.D., is developing a World Wide Web site and reporting system that officials expect to inaugurate this spring.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning a national conference in April to bring together experts to discuss frog deformities.
Peder Larson, commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), has requested that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences consider a research partnership with the state so specialists and laboratories "sufficient to the scale or possible complexity of this problem" can study the frogs.
The institute, which studies public-health issues related to the environment, sent five scientists to Minnesota in December to receive briefings from the MPCA.
An MPCA administrator acknowledged last week that he and others may have been "myopic" earlier this year when they talked about reducing the agency's role in frog research.
In the letter to institute, Larson said the MPCA is "committed to continuing to be a lead agency" in investigating the problem.
Research Directions
While officials try to improve the quality of information about where deformed frogs are found, much of the research in 1997 is aimed at discovering when the abnormalities occur during a frog's life cycle.
Converse, the Wisconsin researcher, and several other scientists agree that the most frequent deformities - missing, partial or extra legs - probably occur early on, when the frog is a tadpole and its limb buds are just forming.
However, most of the deformities so far have not been noticed until the last stage of development, as frogs are emerging from breeding ponds.
The Wildlife Health Center is seeking research money from various sources to "piggyback" with MPCA, Converse said, and proposes to study the entire life cycle of frogs and the changing quality of their breeding ponds.
"You've got to be there earlier when the change is occurring," she said.
"I don't know how else we can learn what the causative factor is."
Judy Helgen, MPCA wetlands biologist, said researchers also need to study frog eggs, which could be affected if frogs were exposed to certain contaminants and passed along any kind of "chemical burden" to their offspring.
"We want to know if we can read from the environment what is causing this, and it's going to be tough," she said.
David Hoppe, herpetologist and biology professor at the University of Minnesota-Morris, has several deformed frogs in hibernation that will be used in breeding trials this spring.
He also has collected frog eggs to raise in different water samples to determine whether the deformities "are a function of the eggs or of the water" in which they grow.
Larger Questions
Val Beasley, amphibian specialist and toxicology professor at the University of Illinois, said frog abnormalities are only the latest "ominous signal" that agricultural practices and rural development are "running amok" and disrupting the balance of nature.
"We push everything to its limits and then try to figure out why it's crashing around us," he said.
Beasley said the cause of deformities could be a combination of factors, including herbicides and fertilizers that decrease natural cover for tadpoles, increase food for pond snails and produce huge numbers of parasites that can burrow into tadpoles.
Stan Sessions, a biology professor at Hartwick College in New York, said the trematode parasite he studied in California frogs in 1990 is the most likely explanation for frog deformities in Minnesota and elsewhere.
"They're at the right place at the right time doing exactly the right kinds of things to interfere with limb development [in frogs]," he said.
But Sessions said he cannot explain why so many deformities have been reported in so many places during the past few years, or why some of the deformed frogs that have been analyzed do not have trematode parasites.
Joe Tietge, a biologist at the EPA's Midcontinent Ecology Division in Duluth, said parasites need more study, but he and other scientists will focus primarily on chemicals.
"There is a class of chemicals that naturally control development in amphibians" and that function as messengers to direct parts of an organism to grow in certain ways, he said.
But there are other non-natural chemicals that can interfere with those messengers or mimic them, he said, resulting in abnormalities.
Tietge said scientists in Duluth and elsewhere are developing new methods to study these changes.
Several EPA regional offices also have proposed projects to study amphibians in different parts of the country, he said.
Tietge said he's "squarely on the fence" about whether chemicals are the leading potential cause of the deformities.
"There are a lot of possibilities and not enough data."
Helgen, the MPCA biologist, has proposed using normal frogs in a study in 1998 to examine their blood serum, gonads and larynxes to determine if male frogs and fish are showing signs of unusual sexual development.
Male carp taken from below the St. Paul metropolitan sewage-treatment plant showed signs of female hormones in a study published last year, and researchers want to expand that research by using frogs and more fish from other locations.
