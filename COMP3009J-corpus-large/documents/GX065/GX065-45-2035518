The exhibition reveals the many different ways that artists have sought, over the past century, to blur the distinction between art and life.
Presented in the exhibition are works dating from 1921 to the present that incorporate found objects and images, elements of performance and digital manipulation.
The inspiration for the exhibition is the recent gift to the museum from the Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation of six works by Joseph Cornell, widely regarded as the American master of collage and assemblage art.
The exhibition is curated by Peter Boswell, assistant director for programs and senior curator at MAM.
"The phrase 'between art and life' comes from a celebrated statement by another American master, Robert Rauschenberg, who stated that he sought to work in 'the gap between art and life,' said Mr. Boswell.
"These Cornell pieces are an important addition to MAM's collection and they provide a perfect point of departure for exploring the realm between art and life."
Artists featured in the exhibition include Vito Acconci, Wallace Berman, Joseph Cornell, Marcel Duchamp, Nancy Grossman, Damien Hirst, Donald Lipski, Ana Mendieta, Louise Nevelson, Claes Oldenburg, Gabriel Orozco, Alfonso Ossorio, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, Betye Saar, Lucas Samaras, Cindy Sherman, and Kurt Schwitters.
The exhibition also showcase a number of young Miami artists, including Westen Charles, Robert Chambers, John Espinosa, Luis Gispert, Mark Handforth, Jean-Claude Rigaud, and Tom Scicluna.
A special installation has been created for the exhibition by the artist duo Guerra de la Paz. -- an evocation of a natural Eden made from discarded clothes.
Over the years the relationship between art and life has become a fertile ground for many artists and their approach to the issue has taken many forms.
Early in the 20th century such artists as Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Kurt Schwitters affixed newspaper fragments, tickets, and other mass-produced printed materials onto their paintings, introducing a piece of everyday reality into the rarified realm of the canvas.
This bold move will be represented in the exhibition by a small but exquisite work by Kurt Schwitters in which he included a ticket (Complete sentence)
Marcel Duchamp went a step farther by taking manufactured objects such as a urinal, a typewriter cover, or a snow shovel and called them "art" without altering them in any way; this bold move raised the question -- what constitutes a work of art? -- a question that artists continue to pose to this day.
Duchamp will be represented in the exhibition by one of his famous boÃ®tes-en-valise, a traveling case filled with miniature replicas of his works, much like a traveling salesman's sample case.
Joseph Cornell-a close friend of Duchamp's, who helped him assemble his first boÃ®tes-en-valise- followed these early leads by assembling together such disparate materials as cordial glasses, maps of the constellations, newspaper fragments, wooden balls, and colored sand into glass fronted wooden boxes that served as poetic metaphors of the vastness of the imaginative life.
Although best known for his assembled boxes, Cornell also worked in collage throughout most of his career.
He will be represented in the exhibition through one box and five collages, all dating from the 1950s and '60s, and recently donated to MAM's permanent collection.
Cornell had an enormous impact on subsequent artists, particularly the so-called Neo-Dada artist of the 1950s and Pop artists of the 1960s.
These artists will be represented through works by Louise Nevelson, who scoured decrepit New York brownstones for her materials, which she assembled and painted a uniform color-usually black or white-to create poetic assemblages evoking mystery and memory; Robert Rauschenberg, who used silkscreened images from newspapers and magazines suggesting the dizzying flux of modern life; and Claes Oldenburg, who made oversized sculptures of common objects such as an ice bag, a clothespin, and a light switch.
More recently, artists have narrowed the gap between art and life by using the camera to create images that blur the distinction between documentation and fabrication.
Cindy Sherman's Film Stills series are fabricated "found images" that look like publicity stills for movies from the 50s or 60s; yet because the figure in them is always the artist herself, they are like fragments of an imaginary visual diary.
Gabriel Orozco photographs eccentric arrangements of objects found in the streets.
His artwork asks the question: are these chance encounters or are they staged? Is this life or is it art, or is art all around us in life?
The digitization of images makes possible a sort of seamless collage that throws into question where life ends and art begins, as in Anthony Goicolea's photographs featuring multiple images of the same person interacting with each other.
In these photographs reality (life) and artifice (art) are indistinguishably intertwined, casting doubt whether reality isn't, in fact, just an artful contrivance, a frame we place around an idea in order to understand it.
The exhibition features a number of new acquisitions to MAM's permanent collection that will be unveiled at MAM for the first time in addition to the Joseph Cornell works.
Among the new acquisitions are sculptures by Miami-based artists Robert Chambers and Westen Charles and by New York-based artist Donald Lipski; photographic works by former Miami residents John Espinos and Luis Gispert and a video by Liliana Porter.
Miami-based artists, Tom Scicluna and the team of Guerra de la Paz, will be making works especially created for the exhibition.
Also included will be several works borrowed from private collections by artists Wallace Berman, Mark Handforth, Damien Hirst, Betye Saar, and Lucas Samaras
