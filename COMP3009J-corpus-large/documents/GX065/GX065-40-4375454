Odd Frogs Might Signal Future Threat
Deformity Cases Grow at Alarming Rate

North Hero -
Frog Number AGI1-29 squirmed uncomfortably in Tom Faber's hand.
The inch-long leopard frog, a beautiful iridescent green with black polka dots, looked normal at first glance.
As Faber checked the frog's hind legs, however, it became clear that frog No. 29 had problems.
There were stumps where the toes of one foot should be.
Faber and other scientists from around the country spent last week combing Vermont for deformed frogs like No. 29.
The search was one of the most intensive frog surveys in the country.
Nationally, scientists are struggling to find out what is causing record numbers of frog deformities found in Vermont and in at least seven other states and two Canadian provinces.
Scientists fear the frogs have been deformed by a pollutant that could threaten humans.
While there are at least four theories on what's hurting the frogs, no one has yet been able to say for certain why the deformities have appeared in recent years.
Vermont was chosen for the intensive survey because, along with Minnesota, it has the highest rates of deformities in the country.
Vermont's effort, coordinated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and researchers at Middlebury College, produced lots of data but little comfort.
Surveyors found the most deformities in West Haven, on the Poultney River, where 45 percent of the 121 frogs collected were deformed, mainly missing hind limbs.
Malformations at many of the other sites averaged 5 percent to 20 percent, said Rick Levey, an aquatic biologist with the state of Vermont who is coordinating the statewide survey.
That's consistent with sites surveyed last summer, where an average of 13 percent of all frogs captured were deformed.
What's troubling is the contrast with the state's historical records.
Until last year, there had been only five reports of deformed frogs found in Lake Champlain in the past 80 years.
Of the 1,000 to 2,000 frogs examined this week, 100 or more will be kept to be sent off to researchers in Quebec, Minnesota and New York to see whether the cause of their deformities can be determined.
Some researchers will look for parasites, viruses or bacteria.
Kathryn Converse, from the federal National Wildlife Health Lab in Madison, Wis., will look at 65 of the frogs to see if there are internal deformities in addition to the obvious external ones.
The stubs of their missing limbs will be examined to make sure the deformities aren't caused by a predator's bite.
And in September, researchers will return to the sites they've sampled in the past week to see what they find.
"There are a whole slew of questions, and not a whole lot of answers," said Greg Hellyer, a lead EPA environmental scientist on the case.
"It's very hard to explain this with just one factor."
Beating the swamps
On a cloudless day this week, Hellyer and his crew loaded up their maroon government van and headed to a series of wetlands in North Hero and Grand Isle, on the northern fringe of Lake Champlain.
The team of Hellyer, EPA environmental engineer Faber, and Bob Hillger, senior science adviser to EPA Regional Administrator John DeVillars, was looking for dispersal sites: areas where large numbers of tadpoles have transformed into tiny, first-year frogs.
Northern leopard frogs were chosen as the species for study because they are common in Vermont in wet meadows.
Other frogs, including green frogs and spring peepers, spend so much time in the water it's too difficult to catch them, Levey said.
Researchers have to concentrate on first-year frogs because the deformities are often so extreme the frog can't be expected to survive more than a few months, Hellyer says.
Timing is everything: If the scientists wait too long after tadpoles have matured into frogs, the weaker, deformed frogs might already have been eaten by predators.
Northern leopard frogs lay their eggs in early spring.
After three weeks, the eggs hatch into tadpoles.
Nine to 12 weeks later, the tadpoles emerge as frogs no more than an inch-and-a-half long.
"The closer you can get to their dispersal site, the better," Hellyer says.
"It's harder to find them when they've dispersed, and some of their brethren may not make it."
Still, finding the frogs and catching them are two different things.
The young frogs like wet meadows, and their dappled skin is perfect camouflage in the sun and shade found on a meadow's edge, as Hellyer and his team discovered.
Wielding white, bread-box sized nets on long poles, the trio converged on one farmer's field with a small dried-up pond on one fringe.
Tiny frogs exploded out of the grass, mostly eluding the frustrated men.
"I got one, I got two," shouted Hillger, as he raised his net triumphantly, two inch-long frogs fluttering in the bottom.
Early on, Hillger demonstrated the most frog-catching skill.
His prowess led his co-workers to dub him "Frog Catcher."
The group's activity caught the attention of dairy farmer Larry Kill, who stopped his tractor while haying to find out why three grown men were waving nets around on the edge of his field.
Kill was excited when he learned of the researchers' mission.
Working in the fields as he does, Kill likes to watch the frogs, snakes and other animals that share his world.
But he was astounded when he learned that all might not be well.
"Holy smokes," he said.
"I'm fascinated by this."
Frog theories
Here's a look at the main causes being explored:
NATURAL AFFLICTIONS: One biologist thinks parasites, viruses or bacterial infection might be at work.
A parasite called a trematode might be burrowing into tadpoles and forming a cyst that blocks normal growth of limbs.
ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT: The earth's thinning ozone layer allows more ultraviolet light to penetrate to the surface of the Earth and the increased levels might be high enough to cause the deformities; another theory is ultraviolet light is converting nontoxic chemicals into toxic chemicals that could affect frog development.
CHEMICAL POLLUTION: Whether from pesticides or airborne toxic chemicals, deformities could be caused by the buildup of these chemicals in the ponds and lakes where frogs breed and develop.
Some of the chemicals being studied by Quebec researcher Martin Ouellet mimic the body's naturally occurring hormones.
Those chemicals might trigger the body to stop development, or cause abnormal development.
PREDATION: Although most researchers discount this idea, they are still investigating it.
The theory is young frogs are losing their limbs to predators like fish or small mammals; most researchers don't think this is the case because predators usually consume the whole animal, and the deformed frogs don't show any evidence of trauma.
