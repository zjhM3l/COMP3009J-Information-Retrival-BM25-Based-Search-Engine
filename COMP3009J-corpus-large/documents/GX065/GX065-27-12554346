Widespread Abnormalities Stump Scientists Pesticides, Parasites Among Explanations

WATERBURY, Vt. - Eight tiny three-legged frogs hopped about awkwardly in a terrarium at the state lab here last week, right next to a tank of bullfrog tadpoles that have bizarre airsacs on their sides that cause them to float sideways.
Two years after reports of deformed amphibians surfaced in the Midwest, the animals are being spotted across the country, from Massachusetts to California, as researchers focus on one of the most puzzling wildlife mysteries in years.
And with the first reported deformities in Massachusetts this spring - three five-legged salamanders - the concern has broadened beyond frogs.
Researchers admit that they are not much closer to explaining all the missing legs, extra eyes, and other abnormalities found in the animals than they were in 1995 when Minnesota schoolchildren found deformed frogs on a field trip.
Possible causes range from a naturally occurring parasite to pesticide run-off to ultraviolet light penetrating the Earth's ozone layer.
``At this point, all the theories have equal weight,'' said Kathy Converse of the National Wildlife Health Center, as she loaded Vermont frogs into a cooler to be shipped to her lab in Wisconsin.
``Until we have some concrete evidence, we have to assume all theories have equal merit.''
To date, the North American Center for Amphibian Malformations, a federally backed group that runs a web page on the amphibian issue, has reports of deformed amphibians in 10 states and two Canadian provinces.
Most of the sightings have been in Quebec, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Vermont.
In Vermont last week, teams of researchers, including Converse, found unusual numbers of deformed Northern leopard frogs in more than half a dozen marshes and meadows around the state.
Fifty of the 115 young frogs found along the Poultney River in West Haven had some physical abnormality, a startling 45 percent deformity rate.
Biologists consider 1 percent to be normal.
The only Massachusetts sighting occurred when two students from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, collecting specimens for an elementary school class, found three yellow-spotted salamanders with an extra hind leg.
``It was smaller than the normal leg, and yet the toes could wiggle and move and the leg itself could move,'' said Scott Jackson, wildlife biologist for the Cooperative Extension Service in Amherst, who saw two of the animals.
The concern behind the intensifying frog search, including a statewide survey launched by a Vermont environmental group last week, has more to do with human health than the frogs themselves.
Because frogs metamorphose from egg to adulthood in the water, rather than in the womb, they may be indicators of environmental contamination.
``The deformities we're seeing may well be caused by human degradation of the environment,' said Barbara Ripley, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.
``Unless we learn that this is a naturally occurring problem, we should be deeply concerned about the deformed frogs.''
Unfortunately, every theory that scientists have advanced to explain the deformities seems unable to explain such a variety of deformities over such a large area.
Several researchers have suggested that pesticides or other manmade chemicals could cause deformities by mimicking the frogs' growth hormones.
But abnormal frogs have been found in places with very different histories of chemical use, from farmland to protected state forests.
Moreover, some reports of deformed amphibians date back to the 1940s, before many of the modern pesticides were heavily used.
``It's hard to explain how one contaminant could cause all this,'' said Greg Hellyer of the US Environmental Protection Agency, who helped look for frogs in Vermont last week.
The idea that the thinning ozone layer could have caused deformities is even less plausible.
Theoretically, the damaged ozone layer allows more ultraviolet light to reach the Earth than in the past, which could in turn photoactivate chemicals and make them toxic.
However, the actual increase in ultraviolet rays reaching the Earth is controversial, and their role in causing developmental defects is unproven.
Stanley Sessions, a biology professor at Hartwick College in New York, has emerged as the leading defender of the theory that the deformities are a natural event.
But his views, too, have come under attack.
Sessions argues that a parasite called a trematode causes the extra legs, forming a cyst in the tadpoles' leg buds that disrupts normal growth.
The missing legs, he argues, were bitten off by predators.
``This whole deformed frog incident has been blown way out of proportion,'' argues Sessions.
``We have been primed to think in terms of environmental pollution, and so that's the first thing we thought of in this case.''
Most researchers agree that some of the extra legs, such as those on the Massachusetts salamanders, could be caused by parasites.
The eight deformed frogs in the terrarium at the Agency of Natural Resources, each missing part or all of a hind leg, had only been out of the water for a few days, leaving little time for predators to eat them.
``They've only been out for a week.
They all have missing legs and they have no sign of fresh trauma,'' said Richard Levey, aquatic biologist at the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.
Consequently, researchers are beginning to suspect that the deformed frog phenomenon could be sort of an amphibian Gulf War Syndrome with no obvious single cause.
``We're probably lumping a whole slew of things together under a common end point,'' said EPA's Hellyer.
But researchers' first concern is simply determining the extent of the abnormalities.
The data still consists mainly of anecdotal reports in most states.
Until last week, the main information on deformities in Vermont had come from a one-day outing last October in which state officials found that 13.1 percent of the frogs they collected had abnormalities.
