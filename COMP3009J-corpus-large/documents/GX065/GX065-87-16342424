[lbls_t3.gif] Bishop, May 24-27 2003 [nersc_sb.gif]
As usual, it was for the simple reason of visiting Erin that we made the journey.
The fact that we had various bits of climbing gear in the car was purely coincidental.
We drove down on Friday afternoon, going over Sonora Pass which had just opened up.
Tioga was still closed, and they're projecting an opening date of mid June.
We were very pleased to discover that the restaurant at the Mobil station at the intersection of 395 and 120 just south of Lee Vining was open.
I sampled their fish tacos and was rather disappointed - the pork loin that I had last time was much tastier.

The reason we went to Bishop.
Once again, it was Erin who suggested that we trek into the Owen's River Gorge to study the texture of the rock, and witness the quality of the water - she is a hydrologist after all.

Note the texture of the rock and the quality of the water.
On Saturday morning, we descended into the upper gorge, trying to stay away from the madness that was sure to plague the popular areas.
Despite the 90 degree weather, the gorge was a popular destination.
We started off at the Lower Elbow Room where Jack and I warmed up on Quail Trail (5.10b).
I only did the first pitch, which was fairly trivial, but Jack continued on to the second, which involved some interesting stemming on a dihedral, and looked very fun.
Rod, Vivian and Erin warmed up on Phoenix (5.7).
Jack and I then did Chuckers (5.10c), which the guide describes as slab, but is really just a face climb with small crimps.
Even though there are many climbs described as "slab" in the guide, true one are very rare - usually they're really thin face.

The sun was beginning to threaten us, so we moved down the gorge a bit, seeking out more shade.
We found some at the Monkey to Monk Area, where Jack led Scorched Egos (5.11b), a tricky climb that starts up a thin crack, then traverses left for 30 feet.
I followed, as it was the only way to clean it, and even then it gave me pause.
Rod led Know the Drill (5.10c), a very fun vertical face climb, which Viv and Erin followed.
We paused for lunch, lurking in the ever diminishing shade, then I braved the sun and led Know the Drill as well.
By the time we were done, the sun had moved sufficiently that the west side of the gorge was in the shade, and some clouds had moved in as well.
We headed for the Mothership Cliff, where I wanted to get back on Living Dead (5.11c).
I had tried this on TR last time we were in the gorge, and wanted to lead it.
I managed to convince Jack that it would be fun, so he hung around while Rod, Vivian and Erin walked further south to play with some gear.
I had a little difficulty about half way up, when I tried to follow the dihedral instead of turning the arete and moving on the face, but after a few minutes of elevated heart rate and frustration, I figured it out and made the move.
This is a really amazing climb that features crack, crimps, smearing, and lots of sweat.
Jack also led the route and had some fun near the top too.
I also led Northern Pike (5.11a), which was interesting, but only had a few 5.11 moves.

Jack and I rejoined the rest of the gang at the DMZ, where Rod, Erin and Viv were playing on Brandenburg Gate (5.7).
Jack proceeded to lead a very tricky Fingertip Ledge of Contentment (5.10c), which had a really tough section where one has two minute crimps for hands, and then has to do an enormous high step.
I followed it, and all I can say is that I'm glad I didn't lead it! I did lead Breaking the Law (5.10a), which was a series of small crimps for fingers and toes, with few rests.
My toes were in serious agony by the end of it.
It was getting late by then so we hiked out, and returned to Erin's place for a fine dinner of jambalaya that Vivian threw together.
On Sunday, we entered at the central gorge, and headed the Dilithium Crystal.
Erin went for a bike ride, but promised to join us later in the afternoon.
The Great Wall of China was literally crawling with people as we walked by - I've never seen it that busy.
There was no one at the Dilithium Crystal though.
We warmed up on Impulse Power (5.10c), then I proceeded to try Photon Torpedo (5.11b).
The guide says it's been getting more difficult as it gets polished, but I found it about right for the grade.
Lots of fun, and fairly sustained.
There's one more bolt on the climb than the guide claims.
Jack also led it, while Rod did Extreme Caffeine (5.10a).
I then tried out Mind Meld (5.12b) on TR. Ouch.
The start is bouldery and hard.
It took me a while to figure out the sequence, and now I know for sure that I don't want to lead it!

After lunch, I tried out Enterprise (5.12b), which is very reminiscent of the climbs at Jailhouse.
The start is fairly positive overhanging pockets, which took a lot out of me.
The top section is crimpy face, somewhere in the mid 5.10s.
I think that I might be able to get it all if I went back and worked the sequence for the first few bolts.
The holds are good, it's just tiring as it's so overhung.
The real crux is making the move just above the roof.

Rod and I went across the river to the Fun House, while Jack and Vivian went to try to stand in line for Hardly Wallbanger on the Pub Wall.
Rod and I both led Melts in Your Mouth (5.10c), a very fun face climb of fairly small holds, with a sturdy bulge in the middle.
You can traverse right of the bulge into slightly easier territory, but then you have to make a few delicate moves getting back left.
We then moved on to Staying Power Towers, where Rod led Blood Sugar Sex Magic (5.10d).
This is a long climb - about 140 ft, and 16 bolts.
We did it as one pitch, with Rod belaying me from the top while I trailed a second line for the rap.
It can be done with one rope, but requires to raps.
It's an excellent climb - many jugs, with a few tricky moves thrown in, and fairly sustained.
As we headed down the gorge to rejoin the rest of the gang, we spotted Lisa, Todd and Doug on Faulty Towers, so we paused to chat.
While chatting, I saw a nice 10d there that I hadn't tried before, so I led Perched , and got a nice stab wound in the chest as I impaled myself on a sharp spire while trying to traverse under the roof.
Ouch.
Rod followed it, and did that section with much better style, avoiding any bloody encounters with the rock.

We finally found Erin, Jack and Vivian climbing at the Warm Up Wall.
They had tried to get in line for Hardly Wallbanger, but were dissuaded by the enormous crowds there.
Vivian had a go at Humbly, Mumbly, Jumbly (5.10b), but made Jack clip the first bolt for her.
After she was done with it, Jack forced me to clean it.
I didn't want to climb anymore, but he made me.
I swear.
As we were standing around the car, trying to regain our breath after the hike out, we were joined by Dan and Chris.
They had been up at Pine Creek in the morning, and then went into the gorge in the afternoon.
They were driving back the next day, and wanted to boulder a bit in the morning, so we made some tentative plans to meet at Schat's for breakfast the next morning.
We headed back to Erin's then decided to go out for pizza, where we hoped to meet up with another large gang from the bay area.
We found Erin and Heather there, but the rest of the gang failed to materialize.
The next morning, I was pushing for a trip to Rock Creek, to get away from the heat and climb a few granite cracks.
Unfortunately, I was outvoted, and after a very large and fattening breakfast at Schat's, we headed for the Happy boulders.
It was hot, and not a cloud in the sky to protect us from mean Mr. Sun.
We spent most of the morning and early afternoon seeking shade under large boulders, making half hearted attempts at a few problems.
The only one of us who worked hard was Jack, who kept on throwing himself at a certain V4.
We finally retreated at around 3, and stopped by a river for a swim.
Or a wade really - the water was only a few feet deep.
It felt rather good, however the mosquitoes made us pay for our pleasure.
We returned to Erin's for a game of scrabble, and to finish off the jambalaya, then walked to the theatre where we saw "The Matrix Reloaded".
What a horrible film - I'm glad movies are cheap in Bishop.
The total lack of acting ability and plot in the film were truely mind boggling.
When we returned to Erin's place, we celebrated Rod's birthday (I won't say which one...) with a very tasty cheese cake than erin had made.
Yum!

We drove back on Tuesday.
We had thought to stop in the Sonora pass area and get in a bit more climbing, but the rock up there was still wet.
Actually, it was considerably more than wet - there were large waterfalls coming down over the routes we wanted to do.
So we just drove straight back, and then ended up meeting again at the gym.
Oh well - plastic isn't anything like granite, but it's better than nothing.
