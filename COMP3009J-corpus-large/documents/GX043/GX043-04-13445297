The report on the National Arson Prevention Initiative reflects the accomplishments of all levels of government, community and church leaders, and the private sector in meeting President Clinton's challenge to stop arson fires.
"I have broadened the scope of this initiative to address this nation's serious problem of arson generally," Witt said.
"Arson affects communities economically, socially, and spiritually every day.
I plan to build on the interests of the many who have contributed to the success of this effort thus far.
Arson is a problem that individuals and communities must work together to solve and FEMA is committed to this cause."
Some of the initiative's notable accomplishments include: * FEMA created the National Arson Prevention Clearinghouse, which is accessible toll-free at 1-888-603-3100.
The Clearinghouse has received more than 10,000 inquiries from every state and territory, and has distributed more than 300,000 arson prevention information packets.
* The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance made grants of $4,600 to 586 counties in 13 targeted southern states to enhance church surveillance efforts and prevent arson.
* The Corporation for National Service's Americorps and VISTA volunteers conducted arson risk assessment surveys and provided arson prevention information in 18 communities that had experienced church arson, and 73 other potentially vulnerable communities in six southeastern states.
* FEMA distributed $774,000 in training grants to all 50 states and the District of Columbia to enhance state and local arson investigation and prevention.
* The Department of Housing and Urban Development authorized the use of existing Community Development Block Grant and Public Housing funds to support arson and other crime prevention community strategies.
* The Department of Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Justice's U.S. Attorneys and Community Relations Service participated in hundreds of community meetings on arson prevention.
* The Department of Education awarded seven grants for a total of $1.8 million for hate crime prevention activities.
* The leaders of eight national fire service organizations joined together with the President last June and signed a resolution committing themselves and their memberships to arson prevention.
Over the last several months, other national organizations representing law enforcement, churches, voluntary agencies, crime prevention, the insurance industry, and educational interests have also committed themselves to this initiative and the cause of arson prevention.
The NAPI Six Month Report is available from the clearinghouse by calling 1-888-603-3100.
