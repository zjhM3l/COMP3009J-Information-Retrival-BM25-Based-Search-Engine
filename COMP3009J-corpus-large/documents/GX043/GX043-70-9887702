Bryan,
The only thing I know about this is that is was reported to be occurring May 5, 2000.
I heard the story connected to the doomsday cults, but I only remember the date because it is the day before my father's birthday.
As I said, beyond that, I have no information.
Thanks for using NEWTON!
Dr. Rupnik
