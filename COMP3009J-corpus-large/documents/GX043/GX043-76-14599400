San Jose Mercury News Latina lawmakers make their mark By Joe Rodriguez--Mercury News Thursday, May 29, 2003 TO get to state Sen. Deborah Ortiz's office, pass first through handcrafted, wooden doors, walk down a marble hallway and take an elevator to the fifth floor, where the grandeur of California's Capitol gives way to linoleum floors and cramped offices.
The Democrat from Sacramento slumped in a chair, pooped from another budget battle.
``Do you know what they want to cut?'' Ortiz asked.
``Dental benefits for poor adults.
Don't they know that if poor adults can't see a dentist, then their young children probably won't either?''
As chairwoman of the Senate Health and Human Services committee, she is one of the most powerful Hispanic women in state government, and she's got more company than you'd expect.
Of the 25 Latinos in the state Senate or Assembly, 12 are women.
There were only three a decade ago, one in 1983 and none in 1973.
The Latina contingent today heads nine standing committees, one more than the Latino men.
As a group, they represent one-fifth of Latina state legislators across the country.
Only New Mexico, a heavily Hispanic state, has more -- 13.
Given California's backlashes against immigrants, bilingual education and affirmative action in recent years, this emergence of Latina leadership is extraordinary.
Most experts credit term limits for opening the door to them.
But what does it mean? Is the Latino community and state better off for them? How do the Latina legislators differ in substance and style from their Latino comrades?
``The women in the (Latino) caucus have a focus on health and human services, in trying to protect people of color and the working poor,'' Ortiz said.
``And I think we do go harder and beyond the liberal responses.
We struggle more with our liberal, Democrat male colleagues than with the Latino men.''
Luis Fraga, a professor of political science at Stanford University has nearly finished his ``Latino/Latina Legislators Project,'' which tracks Latinas in legislatures across the country going back 10 years.
``The hunch we were testing is that the Latina and other women legislators of color may be the strongest and most successful advocates for minority communities,'' Fraga said.
Among his findings for California Latina legislators: A high percentage tend to enter the Legislature from community work; they are just as likely to form alliances with other groups, especially the women's caucus; their top priorities are education and health care -- same as for Latino men -- but the women have more personal experience in these areas; and they have greater appeal to non-Hispanic and suburban voters.
Fraga's study helps explain Ortiz's political profile: A working class kid from a family with no health insurance eventually heads the health committee.
There she passes legislation to fight ovarian cancer, which took the life of her mother.
That leads her to promote funding for controversial stem cell research, which can help defeat diabetes, a disease that hits Latinos particularly hard and took the life of several of Ortiz's aunts and uncles.
State Sen. Martha Escutia, a former United Way official, chairs the Judiciary Committee from an office next door to Ortiz.
The bill she'd most like to pass, is ``the one that does something about Proposition 13.''
Escutia would soften Proposition 13 by removing commercial property from its umbrella, primarily to improve school funding.
Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, chairs the powerful budget committee and is a serious contender for speaker.
Assemblywoman Bonnie Garcia, the only Republican Latina, was elected in a conservative San Diego County district.
Sen. Liz Figueroa, a Salvadoran-American representing suburban Fremont, is the poster girl for cross-over appeal and is a contender for lieutenant governor.
Their accomplishments in office and Professor Fraga's observations support this argument: The Latina legislators have the better stuff for delivering the Latino agenda and for increasing the number of Latinos in statewide office.
So, where does that leave the Latino guys?
``If the women have the cross-group appeal, and on those issues where the men feel the same way,'' Fraga said, ``they should let the women lead.''
