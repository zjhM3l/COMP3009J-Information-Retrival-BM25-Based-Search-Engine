One hundred ten years ago this month, arguably the worst natural disaster to strike the U.S. occurred.
What was it? __________________________________________________________________
Those natural disasters causing the most lost of life in the U.S. occurred earlier this century or late in the last century.
Of course, it's not that storms are less severe now than in previous times or that earthquakes are less powerful.
Actually, there's some evidence that if global temperatures continue to rise, storms may become more intense.
We're just better prepared now than in the past.
In general, our warning systems are much more sophisticated, are structures are safer and people are more aware of potential danger and what to do to avoid it.
This being said, we're still building homes on fault lines, on beaches and in floodplains.
In other parts of the world where either warning systems are deficient or where the inhabitants simply have nowhere to go to escape, people continue to be buried or swept away by flood waters, tsunamis and tidal surges associated with hurricanes.
For example, this past week, hundreds of people drowned when a cyclone (the name for a hurricane in the Indian Ocean) slammed into Pakistan.
Most large countries, if they encompass diverse geographical regions, have to deal with natural phenomena which sometimes prove deadly.
Parts of the U.S. are susceptible to tornadoes, earthquakes, avalanches, mudslides, hurricanes, flooding, lightning, fires, heat waves, cold spells, and volcanoes, all of which have taken their share of lives.
Our deadliest disasters have resulted from earthquakes, hurricanes and floods.
In 1906, the great San Francisco earthquake was responsible for the loss of over 500 lives.
A few years earlier (1900), a hurricane in Galveston, Texas, claimed perhaps 6,000 lives! But the number one cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S. is flash flooding.
In 1889, a flash flood in Johnstown, Pennsylvania killed at least 2,100 people (Galveston was more than 3 times as big as Johnstown at the turn of the century).
The Johnstown flood happened 110 years ago on May 30 and May 31, 1989.
Johnstown was then a manufacturing city of about 30,000 people, located in the Allegheny Mountains of southwestern Pennsylvania.
A slow-moving, but not a powerful storm system, approaching from Ohio pulled warm moist air from the south and east towards the storm center and into the mountains.
Clouds piled up against the mountain ridges, as if brought in on conveyor belts.
The rain started in the afternoon of the 30th.
By evening it was raining hard and didn't let up overnight.
The next morning the water in the Conemaugh River, which runs through Johnstown, was already almost 20 feet above flood stage and higher than ever had been observed.
As much as ten inches of rain was estimated to have fallen in areas around Johnstown and likely more fell at higher elevations.
The official rain gauge for Johnstown was washed away in the flood, as was the official recorder.
Probably every year a deluge like this occurs somewhere in the U.S.
In 1995, for instance, a slow-moving storm with easterly winds ushered in clouds against the Blue Ridge Mountains in north-central Virginia, pouring-down more than a foot of rain on the east-facing flanks.
The resulting floods were devastating.
The loss of life was minimized, though, largely because the area hardest hit was sparsely populated.
Even though the rainfall may have been unprecedented in Johnstown in 1889, what was largely responsible for the high death toll was the failure of an dam upstream on the South Fork River.
Dams are built primarily to protect people from flood waters as well as for hydropower, but when they fail, vast amounts of water in the reservoirs behind them can be unleashed in a few short minutes.
The dam on the South Fork River was built in 1852 to hold water for the Pennsylvania Canal, which was abandoned in the 1870s after the railroad went through.
The reservoir contained a body of water that was about two miles long, and at its widest, about one mile wide - it was about 70 feet deep in the middle.
In the late nineteenth century, dams were, for the most part, constructed of earth and rock rather than concrete.
The dam on the South Fork River was an earthen dam which stood about 72 feet above the river bed and stretched across the river for approximately 900 feet.
This dam was 450 feet higher than the elevation of Johnstown.
In the early 1880s, the height of the dam was lowered two feet so it could be used as a roadway.
This proved to be a fatal mistake.
The water level by noon on the 31st was beginning to breach the dam, and by mid afternoon, the pressure of the added volume of water being exerted against the face of the earthen material was too great (see the science question from this past September about flooding and dikes).
Much of the dam soon gave-away or dissolved, and the entire reservoir emptied in a matter of only about 3/4 of an hour! The unsuspecting residents below never had a chance.
The wall of water was said to look like a black cloud or bank of smoke, and the sound was described as a terrifying roar.
Within minutes Johnstown was destroyed.
Every tree, telegraph pole, and locomotive in the path of the surge was either flattened or quickly carried away.
Much of the debris, including humans desperately clinging to life on anything they could grasp, ended up jammed about a bridge spanning the Conemaugh River.
The volatile mixture of materials in the jam soon caught fire and burned for five days, and sadly, hundreds of people died in the flames before they could be rescued.
As mentioned earlier, these kind of tragedies aren't something that only happened in "olden times."
Each year, lives are lost in floods.
Some areas, because of their geographic setting, are more prone to intense rains and, consequently, to flash flooding than are other areas.
Twenty two years ago this July, a thunderstorm opened up over the Conemaugh River valley, and 8.5 to 12 inches of rain cascaded down its hills and ridges, again flooding Johnstown.
Flood prevention measures had been taken over the years, and the volume of flow on the Conemaugh River and its tributaries was constantly monitored, nevertheless, more than 75 people were killed in the ensuing flooding.
