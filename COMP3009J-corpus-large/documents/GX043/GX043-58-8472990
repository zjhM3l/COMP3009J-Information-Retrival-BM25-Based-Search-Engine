[1.jpg] Why Do We Hunt? W atch a springer spaniel wriggle and squirm ecstatically as it's being led afield to nose up pheasants and you understand a little
We may not wriggle, but walking down a forest trail to a deer stand or wading in mud flats to set out a raft of decoys triggers in hunters irrepressible excitement and pleasure.
Going hunting is like quenching a thirst, scratching an itch.
It seems to satisfy a deep, human need.
Hunting is basic to our natures.
As long as people have populated earth they have taken the lives of other species to feed themselves.
In terms of human time, we've only recently domesticated animals; for most of our history, the meat people have eaten was taken from the carcasses of wild animals they captured and killed.
Social anthropologists maintain that our unique and complicated social organization and language evolved because coordination and communication were necessary to successfully hunt large and dangerous game.
Hunting may have also spurred our aesthetic impulses.
Certainly, some of the first evidence we have of our species; artistic nature, manifested in the cave paintings of Lascaux, France, were stylized representations of animals and the human hunters that pursued them.
When human life and so many human qualities owe their existence to hunting, it seems preposterous that newly organized animal rights groups could claim hunting is inhuman.
Hunters needn't apologize for hunting.
They follow their instinct and their part is clear and straightforward.
Hunters allow no middlemen, salesmen, marketing experts, chefs or grocers to trick them into thinking their lives don't rely on the death of other animals.
For hunters, the formula is as simple as nature herself: an animal is harvested to feed the hunter's family.
[2.jpg] Nor is hunting cruel.
Game animals aren't caged, fattened, bred, jam together or raised on production lines.
They live in forests, clearings and wetlands, following the natural instincts of their species.
Some fall day, a hunter's bullet may end a wild animal's life.
Animal rights activists often dwell on that exact moment, seeming to forget that death is the fate of all living things.
A hunter's bullet is usually clean and quick.
Good hunters insist on it.
Thanks to hunters' interest in maintaining sustainable populations of game animals and to many dollars generated for wildlife management through license sales and special taxes on hunting equipment, the number of deer, turkey, squirrel and other game species are stable or increasing.
Other species, such as the giant Canada goose, have been brought back from the brink of extinction.
Regulated hunting seasons and bag limits keep animal populations in check and prevent a repeating boom and bust cycle of overabundance followed by disease and mass starvation.

Hunting also brings into balance those who go afield.
Hunting rewards alertness, patience, self-restraint.
It demands stealth, keen vision, a knowledge of the quarry and its environment.
Those who refuse to learn the ways of the woods are seldom successful.
It's true, hunters could buy their meat in sanitized, foam and plastic containers from the supermarkets, leaving the killing to others.
By doing so, however, they'd sacrifice their sense of self-reliance, of individuality, of participation in the natural world.
"If they only didn't seem to enjoy it so much," some people complain, as if hunting would be acceptable if it were dull, tedious work.
But hunting provides many pleasures, including lifelong companions, loyal and hard-working dogs, the earthy scents of linseed oil and decaying leaves.
Every bit of a hunt is somehow satisfyingplanning, scouting, packing sandwiches to eat on a downed log, driving in the darkness to reach a hunting stand before first light, listening to the forest awake, being startled by nearby snap of a twig...
And yes, a hunter who successfully brings down a swift, intelligent and graceful prey animal does experience happiness and pride.
If it were not forever so, humans wouldn't be on this planet today.

[3.jpg] Hunting is a great way to learn more about wildlife and nature and to carve your own personal niche in the cycle of life.
Hunters don't just observe nature, we participate.
We become immersed in the birds and animals we seek and constantly strive to learn more about them.
We scout, plan, and anticipate.
Hunting is also great fun.
It's and outstanding way to forge strong bonds with family and friends.

[4.jpg] Hunting is one form of exercise that I truly enjoy...being in the woods...seeing everything in its natural state...breathing the fresh air...and watching my grandson's progress in his learning of the hunting skills.
I also enjoy the feeling that I am helping nature keep things in balance, through the licenses and taxes I pay on supplies, which helps the Missouri Conservation Department do the great job it is doing.

[5.jpg] Hunting lets me escape urban trappings and reconnect with nature.
I'm glad to have a season when I can leave plastic, concrete, car horns, computers, commercials and manipulating people behind and participate in the simple and stark world of predator vs. prey.
Hunting requires and develops self-discipline, cunning and patience, talents I believe valuable, even in these modern times.

Facts About Hunting * Safety
Statistics show there is only one accident for every 10,000 hunters.
In fact, of all the accidental deaths in 1987, only two percent involved firearms, much less than drowning, suffocation and burns.
To further reduce hunting accidents, the Conservation Department requires hunter safety training for everyone born on or after January 1,1967.
Over 500,000 Missourians have received hunter safety certificates.
* Stable wildlife populations A healthy deer herd on suitable habitat can be reduced by as much as 40 percent with no ill effect on populations; hunters rarely take more than 15 percent.
If not harvested, a deer herd can double in size in only two years, quickly deplete available food supplies and face certain starvation.
Quail have an annual mortality rate of 75 to 85 percent, whether they are hunted or not.
* Funds for all wildlife Through license fees and taxes on equipment, hunters and anglers contribute an average of $3 million each day to wildlife conservation.
Habitat improvement that benefits quail likewise helps songbirds; land that's acquired or managed for deer or turkey also provides homes for foxes, bobcats, other mammals and many species of birds.
