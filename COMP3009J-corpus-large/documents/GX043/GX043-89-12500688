TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ REGISTRATION OF TEN INTERSPECIFIC GERMPLASM RESTORATION LINES FOR SUNFLOWER PET1 MALE-STERILE CYTOPLASM Author(s): SEILER GERALD J JAN CHAO C Interpretive Summary:
Cultivated sunflower ranks second only to soybean among field crops grown for the production of edible oil.
It is also the second largest hybrid crop in the world.
Unfortunately, it is based on a single male sterile cytoplasm as the female parent with a limited number of male pollinators.
Wild sunflowers are the ancestors of the cultivated sunflower.
The ancestors comprise a strong natural variation for morphological and physiological characteristics.
The problem is that many of the species are very distant relatives of the cultivated sunflower so the breeding of the wild relative with cultivated sunflower can be very difficult.
In the present study we have developed interspecific germplasm lines to add diversity to the cultivated sunflower.
The lines are rather primitive and are based on three annual species and one perennial species.
Based on the present breeding system in sunflower, these lines offer the opportunity to introduce foreign genes directly into the cultivated sunflower.
Utilization of these germplasm lines in a sunflower breeding program has the potential of increasing the genetic diversity for disease resistance and decreasing the genetic vulnerability of cultivated sunflower.
