Battered Women's Programs/Sexual Assault Services (Twin Cities) NOTE: Do not assume that a battered woman prefers to work with an advocate from her country of origin or ethnic community.
In some cases, these communities are very small, making a woman uncomfortable to work with someone who may know her family or acquaintances.
Please ask the battered woman whether she would prefer to work with an advocate who speaks her language or from her country before referring her.
