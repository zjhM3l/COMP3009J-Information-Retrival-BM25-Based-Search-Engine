DIMENSION S Dimension stone consists of quarried blocks or large pieces of rock including granite, marble, limestone, sandstone, and slate.
These stones are cut into panels, slabs or other shapes for primary use in building and construction, in monuments, and in curbing.
The most prominent required qualities of dimension stone are strength, toughness, hardness, and resistance to environmental damage.
Color and grain structure contribute largely to price and marketability.
U.S. stone production data are developed by the U.S. Geological Survey from a voluntary survey of U.S. producers of rough and finished dimension stone.
Of the 278 dimension stone operations surveyed for 1995, including those that were idle, 209, 75% responded, representing 81% of the estimated value shown in table 1.
(See table 1.)
In comparison with 1994, total domestic stone production for 1995 decreased 3% to 1.16 million metric tons valued at $233 million.
Exports of dimension stone decreased slightly in value to $51.8 million.
The value of dimension stone imports for consumption increased 8.6% to $478 million, equivalent to double the value of domestic production.
(See table 2.)
Production Blocks cut or split from a quarry face are typically transported to processing plants often located at the site, for final sizing and finishing operations.
Stone finishing may include polishing, edging, and decorating the final stone products.
Recent developments in quarry and processing technology include techniques for making very thin natural stone products.
Of the total dimension stone production in 1995, 42% was granite; 31% was limestone; 13% was sandstone; 3% was marble; 3% was slate; and 8% was miscellaneous stone.
Four States, Georgia, Indiana, Vermont, and Wisconsin, had dimension stone production exceeding 100,000 metric tons.
These four States represent 45% of total domestic production.
(See table 3.)
Leading producing companies in terms of tonnage were Cold Spring Granite Co., principally in California, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Texas; Rock of Ages Corp. in New Hampshire and Vermont; Fletcher Granite Co., Inc. in Massachusetts and New Hampshire; Indiana Limestone Co., Inc. in Indiana, and Halquist Stone Co., Inc. in Wisconsin.
Granite.--Dimension granite includes all coarse-grained igneous rocks.
Production in 1995 remained comparable with 1994 levels at 495,000 tons with a 15% increase of value to $104 million.
Granite was produced by 42 companies at 80 quarries in 19 States.
Georgia continued to be the leading State, producing 25% of the U.S. total.
Cold Spring Granite, Rock of Ages, Fletcher Granite Co., and McCannon Granite Co. were TONE By Jim F. Lemons, Jr. the leading producers and accounted for 56% of U.S. production.
(See table 4.)
Limestone--Dimension limestone includes bituminous, dolomitic, and siliceous limestones.
Production in 1995 remained comparable with 1994 levels at 363,000 tons with a 5% increase in value to $61 million.
It was produced by 29 companies at 39 quarries in 13 States.
Indiana, the leading State, produced 172,000 tons in 1994, with Wisconsin, as the second largest producer and Kansas as the third largest.
(See table 5.)
Sandstone.--Dimension sandstone includes calcareous- and siliceous-cemented sandstones or conglomerates.
Quartzite, which also is included, may be described as any siliceouscemented sandstone.
In 1995, the U.S. total for sandstone decreased by 16 % from 1994 levels to 145,000 tons valued at $17 .2 million.
Dimension sandstone was produced by 29 companies at 50 quarries in 15 States.
Leading producing States were New York and Pennsylvania.
(See table 6.)
Consumption Production during the year was assumed to equal consumption, since no separate accounting is made of changes in industry stocks.
Rough stone represented 51% by tonnage and 32% by value of the dimension stone market.
The largest uses of rough stone were in building and construction (48%) and monumental ( 24%).
Dressed stone represented 49% of the total consumed tonnage.
The largest uses of dressed stone market share were in ashlars and partially squared pieces at 24%, curbing at 22%, flagging at 18%, and monumental at 9%.
(See table 7.)
Granite.--Primary uses of the 1995 reported consumption of granite by weight ( 495,000 tons) were in monumental applications (rough stone 27% and dressed stone 9%), rough blocks for construction 20%, and dressed stone used in curbing 25%.
(See table 8.)
Limestone.--Primary uses of the 1995 reported consumption of limestone by weight (363,000 tons) were in rough blocks for building and construction 41%, and dressed stone for ashlars and partially squared pieces 17% (See table 9.)
Marble.--Dimension marble includes certain hard limestones, travertines, and any other calcareous stone that can be polished.
Marble sold or used in the United States in 1995 increased 9% in tonnage to 39,600 tons, and 2% in value to $21 .1 million, from 1994.
Marble was produced by 7 companies at 13 quarries in 6 States and Puerto Rico.
(See table 10.)
Sandstone.--Primary uses of the 1995 reported consumption of sandstone by weight (145,000 tons) were in dressed stone for 1 flagging 44%, and dressed stone for ashlars and partially squared pieces 17%.
(See table 11.)
Slate.--Slate is a fine grained metamorphic rock derived from shale, siltstone, or claystone.
Shale is composed mostly of original clay minerals, and cleavage is parallel to the bedding.
Dimension slate sold or used by producers in the United States in 1995 remained comparable with 1994 .
Slate was produced by 17 companies at 25 quarries in 8 States.
Forty three percent of the slate was used for roofing.
(See table 12.)
Two major dimension stone projects completed this year were the Denver International Airport and the Korean War Veterans Memorial.
The Denver Airport included almost 20,000 square feet of 2-centimeter-thick cut-to-size marble slabs from the Colorado Yule quarry.
This quarry was reopened in 1990 after being closed for almost 50 years.
Previously this quarry had supplied marble for the exterior of the Lincoln Memorial and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Washington, DC.
The Korean War Veterans Memorial was dedicated in July 1995.
The memorial consists of a 164 foot long reflective wall made from 41 panels of Cold Spring granite etched with thousands of photographic images.
A total of 2,000 square meters (22,000 square feet) of Academy black granite quarried in Clovis, CA was supplied for the wall and the polished inscription paver.
Prices The average 1995 price for dimension stone increased to $203 per ton from $183 in 1994.
Foreign Trade Exports.--Exports of dimension stone decreased slightly in value to $51.8 million.
The primary export was granite principally to Italy.
(See table 13.)
Imports.--Imports for consumption of dimension stone increased 8% in value to $476 million, mostly because of increases in imports of major granite categories of dimension stone.
(See tables 13, 14, 15, and 16.)
Italy remains a principal supplier of granite.
Other principal suppliers of granite are Brazil, Canada, and India.
Brazilian granites have become very popular in residential markets.
India greens are popular in kitchen countertops.
China is a relatively new country in the U.S. granite market.
Low pricing has allowed their strong entry into U.S. markets.1 Current Research and Technology In 1995, the dimension stone industry moved into the computer age in areas of fabrication and marketing.
Computerized design is becoming more prominent in the industry with the use of etching and contour cutting of memorials stones.
Images such as those on the Korean War Veterans Memorial can be produced using computer-assisted laser etching of the stone.
Computerized wire saws are now able to cut complex hearts, animals, and other abstract repr esentations on monuments.
In addition, many companies and leading trade journals have developed web sites.
These sites allow designers to view and select stone from color representations of the stone shown on computerized images.
Outlook Industry experts believe North American firms are more likely to be successful in the 1990's when a large portion of their sales are in fast-growing niche markets: granite and marble in kitchens and bathrooms, limestone in landscaping stone and ledges, hand-carved or worked stone in custom built houses, and perhaps, limestone tiles.
The trend is continuing for the use of "natural stone" to provide a rustic earthy setting.
This includes acid-washed stone and other stones that are harder to take a polish.
Annual growth rates through this decade have been projected to be 2.6% for granite; 3.7% for limestone; 3.8 to 5% for slate and 2.0 to 4.5% for marble.2 1 2 Dimension Stone.
