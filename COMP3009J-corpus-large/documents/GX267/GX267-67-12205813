COMPREHENSIVE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PLANNING GUIDELINES for the Gulf Prairies and Marshes Ecological Region of Coastal Texas (Prepared in partial fulfillment of the requirements of HB 1358 - Wildlife Management Property Tax Valuation) The Texas Constitution and the legislature now provide those with a current 1-d-1 Agricultural Valuation (often known as an Ag Exemption) an opportunity to change at an equal tax value from primarily ag use to primarily wildlife use through a Wildlife Management Tax Valuation.
To immediately determine if you may qualify for the Wildlife Use Valuation, please refer to Appendix A, the 1-d-1w Wildlife Use Appraisal Checklist, or call or visit your County Tax Appraiser.
HB 1358 by Representative Clyde Alexander provided that the landowner must implement and complete at least one management practice from at least three of the seven wildlife management activities listed in Appendix B. Most landowners interested in wildlife can meet this requirement, and implement several practices beyond the minimum required.
A Sample Wildlife Management Plan for 1-d-1w is attached in Appendix C.
This provides a quick review and example of how a landowner may go about preparing a wildlife management plan for their property.
It is highly recommended that the landowner prepare a wildlife management plan, and almost every county appraiser requires a wildlife and habitat management plan to review the context, extent and time-frame of selected practices.
The "plan" must address a separate practice in at least three of the seven wildlife management categories.
The following is intended to provide the landowner with information to develop their own plan.
The plan may be as simple or as extensive as the landowner chooses.
These practices are intended as guidelines.
Certain site-specific situations may necessitate changes that can be allowed, if based on trained resource professionals' recommendations.
A wildlife management plan describes historic and current land use practices, establishes landowner goals and objectives (also family goals if desired) for the property, and describes specific activities and practices designed to benefit wildlife species of interest and their habitats.
This is the landowner's plan, designed by the landowner, with the possible assistance of a wildlife biologist of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department [TPWD], Texas Agricultural Extension Service [TAEX]
Efforts to perform activities identified in the plan are completely voluntary on the part of the landowner, except those practices that are necessary to maintain the agricultural appraisal for 4
wildlife management use.
A complete plan will likely include elements of all seven listed wildlife management activity categories.
Landowners of smaller properties that cannot by themselves meet intensity requirements for wildlife management use may choose to be an active member of a Wildlife Management Association (wildlife co-op) that is actively working under a cooperative wildlife management plan and participating in key practices.
For more information about forming or joining a Wildlife Management Association, contact Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (800/792-1112) or your county extension agent.
General Habitat Management Considerations/Recommendations: Fundamental requirements that must be considered when managing wildlife habitat include food, cover, water and the proper distribution of these elements.
Wildlife and habitat management should be directed at maintaining a productive and healthy ecosystem.
The ecosystem consists of the plant and animal communities found in an area along with soil, air, water and sunlight.
All management activities should be aimed at conserving and improving the quantity and quality of soils, water and vegetation.
Managing for plant diversity is essential.
A diverse habitat has a good mixture of various species of grasses, forbs (weeds), and browse (woody) plants.
Many of these plants will be at various stages of growth, which adds another element of diversity.
The diversity of vegetation increases the availability of food and cover for wildlife species.
A greater diversity of range plants results in more food being made available during different periods of the year.
The volume and diversity of plants protects the soil from erosion.
The decomposition of vegetation also helps restore needed minerals to the soil to sustain plant life.
Vegetation improves the water cycle by increasing water infiltration into the soil and reducing surface runoff.
An ecologically based habitat management program serves to improve water cycling, mineral cycling, and energy flow and manipulate plant succession.
These processes enhance vegetative quantity, quality and diversity.
A greater diversity of all life forms, including microorganisms, insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals may be achieved under sound management.
The land's long term health is improved and conserved for future generations to utilize as a source of income, recreation and for aesthetic enjoyment.
Plant communities with a diversity of grasses and native broad-leaved weeds (called forbs) are more productive than those comprised primarily of grasses.
The climax plant community of most rangelands is comprised primarily of perennial grasses with a relatively low forb component.
While this may be suitable for livestock and some grassland wildlife, most species are dependent on the seeds and foliage of forbs.
Periodic disturbances such as fire, soil disturbance, livestock grazing, and mowing can set back plant succession and maintain a diverse plant community, simulating conditions under which plants and animals evolved within ecosystems in Texas.
Below is an example of a plan that many landowners in the Gulf Prairies and Marshes may find 5
applicable to their property, depending on their particular goals and objectives.
A fill-in-the-blank plan following this format is attached in Appendix T.
This is presented to help landowners develop a Wildlife and Habitat Management Plan.
To meet the requirements of the wildlife management tax valuation, a landowner must annually implement and complete at least one management PRACTICE from at least three of the seven wildlife management ACTIVITIES (i.e. Habitat Control, Erosion Control, Predator Control, Providing Supplemental Supplies of Water, Providing Supplemental Supplies of Food, Providing Shelter, and Making Census Counts to Determine Population).
Again, a complete plan will likely include more than three activities, and may include several practices under each activity.
Space is provided throughout the plan [ ] for the land manager to designate the management practices that will be implemented.

Specific Habitat Management Practices, By Activity
A. HABITAT CONTROL [ ] GRAZING MANAGEMENT (Refer to Appendix D - Livestock Recommendations, for information to help prepare a specific grazing proposal for the plan.)
Grazing management is the planned manipulation of livestock numbers and grazing intensities to increase food, cover, or improve structure in the habitat of selected species.
Grazing management includes: 1) kind and class of livestock grazed, 2) determination and adjustment of stocking rates, 3) implementation of a grazing system that provides planned periodic rest for pastures by controlling grazing intensity and duration, and/or 4) excluding livestock from sensitive areas to prevent trampling, allow for vegetative recovery, or eliminate competition for food and cover.
Planned deferments can be short or long term up to 2 years.
Extended rest from grazing (two years or more, if necessary) may be required on some ranges.
Seasonal stocker operations may be appropriate to manipulate habitat.
Supplemental livestock water (earthen tanks, troughs, wells, piping) to facilitate deferred rotational grazing of livestock and disperse grazing pressure may be incorporated into planning to improve wildlife habitat.
Similarly, it is important to plan and design fence construction to facilitate deferred-rotation grazing of livestock (a minimum of Â½ mile of barbed-wire or electric fence must be constructed per year).
Fencing can also be used to enhance or protect sensitive areas, woodlands, wetlands, riparian areas and spring sites as designated in plan.
Activities should be reviewed annually.
Select the type of grazing system to be implemented.
Also attach an initial grazing schedule as an addendum to the plan.
[ ] 1 Herd / 2 Pasture (only as a step in moving toward a 1 herd / multiple pasture {4+} grazing system that provides a minimum of 75% of land rested, with a time-line in he plan to meet this goal) 10

Briefly describe and show on a map: ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________
[ ] PRESCRIBED BURNING (Refer to Appendix E Vegetation Management Recommendations, for information to help prepare a specific burning proposal for the plan.)
Prescribed burning is the planned application of fire to enhance habitat and plant diversity, increase food and manipulate cover, or improve structure in the habitat of selected species.
Plans should indicate a minimum percent of acreage 12
and general burning cycle (eg. minimum of 33 percent of acreage annually burned in coastal marshes, 15 percent in wooded uplands, and 20 percent in rangeland).
Attach a written burning plan as an addendum to the Wildlife and Habitat Management Plan (burn plans and prescribed burning should only be attempted with aid of professionals).
The plan should include a map that shows the areas to be burned and the planned dates (month and year) that each area will be burned during the burn cycle.
It should also designate areas to be protected from burning, and should incorporate flexibility during periods/years when conditions are not favorable.
Planned acreage to be burned___________ Date to be burned________ Completed acreage burned___________ Date burned__________ Specific areas (eg. sensitive sites) will be protected from burning.
Briefly describe and show on a map: ________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________
[ ] RANGE ENHANCEMENT (Range Reseeding) Establish native herbaceous plants (grasses and forbs) that provide food and cover for wildlife or erosion control benefits.
Plant species selected and methods for establishment should be applicable to the county (nonnative species are generally not recommended, but if required for a specific purpose, non-native species should not exceed approximately 25 percent of the seeding mix).
Seeding mixtures providing maximum native plant diversity are recommended.
Many herbaceous broadleaf plants (known as forbs - weeds and wildflowers) are beneficial to wildlife for forage and/or seed production.
See key species adapted to the Gulf Prairies and Marshes in Appendix on Native Prairie planting and procedures).
Encourage "weed and wildflower" species by selective application of chemical, biological (eg. grazing management) and/or mechanical means on native rangelands, Conservation Reserve Program lands, and tame grass pastures (eg. coastal bermuda).
Some periodic weed control may be needed in fields converted to native rangeland to assist in the establishment of desirable vegetation.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan and be designed to reestablish native habitats within a specified time frame.
13
Range enhancement should annually affect a minimum of 10% of the total area designated in the plan, or a minimum of 10% annually, whichever is smaller, until the project is completed.
Show the designated areas where Range Enhancement is to be implemented on a map.
Total acres to be seeded _________ Approximate acres to be seeded annually ________ Planned seeding mixture (list names and percentage of total seed mix): Seeding [ [ [ Method: ] Broadcast ]
Fertilized to encourage establishment? [ ] yes [ ]
[
] BRUSH MANAGEMENT
(Refer to Appendix E - Vegetation Management Recommendations, for information to help prepare a specific brush management proposal for the plan.)
Brush management may be the removal or establishment of woody plants.
It can be the selective removal or suppression of target woody species, including exotics, to allow the increased production of desirable trees, shrubs, grasses, and forbs for forage and nesting or protective cover for selected species.
Brush management practices should annually affect a minimum of 10% of the total area designated in the plan, or a minimum of 10 acres annually, whichever is smaller.
This practice includes retaining the proper kind, amount, and distribution of woody cover for selected species.
Brush planning management planning must consider wildlife cover requirements, soil types, 14
slope angle and direction, soil loss and erosion factors, and subsequent planning to control reinvasion.
This practice also includes retention of snags to provide cover and nesting sites for cavity nesting animals.
When used, herbicides should be applied in strict accordance with label directions.
This practice can include the planting of a minimum of 150 individuals of native tree and shrub species per acre per year for the area designated in the plan to provide food, corridors and/or shelter using species and methods as described in appendices.
Brush management must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.

[
] TIMBER/BOTTOMLAND HARDWOOD MANAGMENT
Periodic harvest, removal or suppression of trees or woody species, including exotics, to allow the increased production of desirable trees, shrubs, grasses, and forbs for forage and nesting or protective cover for selected species.
Timber management includes retaining the proper kind, amount, and distribution of woody cover for selected species.
This practice also includes retention of snags to provide cover and nesting sites for cavity nesting animals.
When used, herbicides should be applied in strict accordance with label directions.
This includes precommercial thinning or non-commercial thinning which involves reducing the stocking levels in a stand to increase the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground to increase the growth or 15
production of herbaceous vegetation or browse plants in the understory.
Establish native tree and shrub species to provide food and cover using species and methods applicable to the county (some non-native exceptions may be noted where native species have limited success for addressing the limiting factors for wildlife).
When used, herbicides should be applied in strict accordance with label directions.
Restore important forested habitats including bottomland hardwoods, bogs, and upland hardwoods.
A minimum of 150 native seedlings/acre/year for the area designated in the plan.
Avoid fragmentation of large forested habitats.
Maintain at least 100 yards of buffer habitat along each side of streams.
This practice must be part of an overall habitat management plan and should be based on consultation of a professional forester.
Briefly describe the proposed Timber Management project(s) and identify on a map: ____________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________
[
] RIPARIAN MANAGEMENT AND ENHANCEMENT
Annually and seasonally protect the vegetation and soils in riparian areas (low areas on either side of stream courses) from mismanagement, such as caused by excessive, long-term livestock trampling or caused by poor timber harvest practices.
Riparian management and enhancement can include providing livestock with alternate watering sites, deferring livestock grazing in pastures with riparian areas during critical periods of the year, total exclusion of livestock from pastures with riparian areas, and fencing riparian areas to exclude or provide short duration grazing by livestock.
Establish trees, shrubs, or herbaceous vegetation along streams or water courses to provide food, cover, and travel corridors, and to reduce erosion.
Corridors should be at least 100 yards wide.
Restore important forested habitats including bottomland hardwoods and turkey roost sites.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
A minimum of one Riparian Management and Enhancement project must be implemented every 5 years to qualify.
Show the planned project(s) on a map.
See Appendix E. Proposed Riparian Management and Enhancement projects: [ ] Fencing [ ]
Season of deferment from livestock grazing: __________
[ ] WETLAND ENHANCEMENT Annually provide seasonal or permanent water for roosting, feeding, or nesting habitat for wetland 16
wildlife.
This practice involves shallow wetland management, creation or restoration of wetlands, greentree reservoir creation or management, and other moist soil management.
Selective herbicide applications may be necessary for control of problem wetland vegetation.
Wetlands and saline lakes management includes protection from modifications (i.e. drainage, saltwater intrusion, filling, shape alteration, etc.), protecting vegetation, maintaining water by pumping, seeding grass/legumes, buffers, prescribed grazing and burning, and fencing to enhance manageability.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
Annual management as described in management plan, such as water level manipulation, is required to qualify.
Construction of a new project will qualify for 5 years.
Briefly describe the proposed Wetland Enhancement project(s) and identify on a map: ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________
[ ] HABITAT PROTECTION FOR SPECIES OF CONCERN Planned protection and management of land or a portion of land to provide habitat for an endangered, threatened or rare species, such as fencing off critical areas, managing vegetation structure and diversity within species parameters, establishing and maintaining firebreaks to protect critical overstory vegetation, and annually monitoring the species of concern.
This includes the management/protection of 17
nesting sites, feeding areas, and other critical habitat limiting factors, and the development of additional areas.
The broad-scale management of habitat for migrating/wintering/breeding neotropical birds (primarily songbirds) should follow guidelines in the appendix for zones of importance.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
(Refer to Appendix I for information on the management of the Southern Bald Eagle, Houston Toad, Attwater's Prairie Chicken, Ocelot, Jaguarundi, and other species of concern that occur in portions of the Gulf Prairies and Marshes.)
A minimum of one project must be implemented every 5 years to qualify.
Proposed Habitat Protection for Species of Concern project(s): Show location of species or habitat type on a map.
Planned [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ protection/management projects: ] fencing ]
[ ] PRESCRIBED CONTROL OF NATIVE, EXOTIC AND FERAL SPECIES Use legal means to control numbers of grazing and browsing animals.
Maintain the population density of native wildlife (particularly whitetailed deer) at the carrying capacity of the habitat to prevent overuse of desirable plant species and enhance habitat for native wildlife species.
Populations of exotic wildlife (including feral hogs) should be strictly controlled to 18
minimize negative impacts on native wildlife and habitats.
This should incorporate harvest and vegetative monitoring over time to assess control intensity and impact on habitat to meet plan objectives.
Remove or control exotic vegetation impacting native habitats and wildlife populations (eg. large stands of Chinese tallow trees, McCartney rose, etc.).
Convert tame pasture grasses (such as large areas of coastal bermuda) to native vegetation.
This practice must be a part of an overall habitat management plan.
The removal or control of exotic vegetation or the conversion of tame grass pastures must affect a minimum of 10% of the area designated in the plan, or 10 acres annually, whichever is smaller.
Briefly describe the proposed Prescribed Control of Native, Exotic, and Feral Species project(s) and show on a map as applicable: __________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________
[ ] WILDLIFE RESTORATION Restoration or enhancement of habitat to good condition for target species, and reintroduction and population management of TPWD approved native species within the carrying capacity of the habitat as part of an approved restoration area at a scale capable of supporting a sustainable population (eg. eastern turkey).

[
] GULLY SHAPING
Reducing erosion rates of severely eroded areas by smoothing with top soil to acceptable grades and reestablishing vegetation, primarily native vegetation, with sensitivity to existing wildlife cover and woody vegetation that provides travel corridors.
Area must be interseeded with species that provide food and/or cover for wildlife to be applicable (see range enhancement guidelines).
This practice may include the feeding of large numbers of cattle on gully sites to contour the eroded areas by way of hoof action to aid in the recovery of the site.
Practice must be a part of the plan.
A minimum of one project must be completed every 5 years to qualify.

PREDATOR CONTROL [ ] PREDATOR MANAGEMENT
The management of predator populations to increase survival of target species.
Key native predator species may include coyote, raccoon, skunk, bobcat, and mountain lion, and rat snakes, while exotic predators may include feral house cat, feral dog, and feral hogs.
Predator control alone will not be an applicable practice unless it is part of an overall plan to manage the habitats and populations of the target species.
Texas Parks and Wildlife advocates elimination of feral/exotic predators, with the thoughtful management of native predators as an integral part of functioning natural systems.
The predator control plan should be prepared or approved by a competent professional and include the list, duration and intensity of methods to remove the target species annually.

[ ] FOOD PLOTS The establishment of locally adapted annual (spring and fall) or perennial forages on suitable soils to provide supplemental foods and cover during critical periods of the year.
Livestock should be generally excluded from small food plots.
The shape, size, location, and percentage of total land area should be based on requirements for the target species (eg. 2-5% of area for white-tailed deer) and should meet goals of a comprehensive wildlife plan.
A minimum of 1% of the acreage should be planted in both winter and summer food plots.
Managing the habitat for proper nutrition should be the primary management goal.
Supplemental feeding and/or planting of food plots is not a substitute for good management.
These practices should only be considered as "supplements" to the native habitat, not as "cure-alls" for low quality and/or poorly managed habitats.
Supplemental feeding should always be combined with population management, or the resulting artificially higher numbers of animals will have a negative impact on native plants.
Consult with the NRCS, TAEX, TPWD, and local seed dealers for food plot mixtures suitable for your area.
Plant according to dealer recommendations with proper equipment.

[ ] BRUSH PILES AND SLASH RETENTION The planned placement and/or retention of brush piles to provide additional wildlife cover in habitats where cover is a limiting factor for the selected species.
This practice also includes slash retention, or leaving dead brush on the ground where it was cut or uprooted, to provide wildlife cover and protection for seedlings of desirable plant species.
Stacking posts or limbs in teepees can provide cover for small game and other wildlife in open areas.
Artificial cover of this type may have an extended life if suspended on a frame above the ground if it is to subsist and be of any long term value (eg. 30' diameter brush pile at 1 per 40 acres in open areas to meet optimum overhead protective cover requirements for bobwhite quail).
This practice must be part of a comprehensive wildlife management plan.
A minimum of 3 percent of the designated area must be treated annually to qualify.

A minimum length of 100 yards of Fence Line Management per Â¼ mile of fence is required annually to qualify.
Proposed Fence Line Management project(s) and show on a map as applicable: Length of fenceline (feet)____ Initial establishment [ ] yes [ ]
[ ] HAY MEADOW, PASTURE AND CROPLAND MANAGEMENT FOR WILDLIFE Mowing/swathing of hay fields should be postponed until after the peak of nesting/rearing period of ground-nesting birds and mammals (July 1).
Mow/shred 1/3 of open areas per year, preferably in strips or mosaic types of patterns, to create "edge" and structural diversity.
A wide bar should be placed on the front of the tractor at a height of 1' when mowing to help flush wildlife using this cover.
Weeds are an important source of food for many wildlife species, therefore minimize weed control practices.
Use no till/minimum till agricultural practices to leave waste grain and stubble on the soil surface until the next planting season to provide supplemental food or cover for wildlife, control erosion, and improve soil tilth.
Other forms of supplementing and providing shelter include roadside right-of-way management for groundnesting birds, establishing perennial vegetation on levees, dikes, terraces, fencerows and field borders, establishing multi-row shelterbelts or renovating old shelterbelts, and protecting and managing old homesites, farmsteads and Conservation Reserve Program cover.
