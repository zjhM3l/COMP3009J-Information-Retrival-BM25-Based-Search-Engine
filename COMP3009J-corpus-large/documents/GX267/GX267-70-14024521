L i m i t at i on s i n A c t i v i t i e s of D ai l y L i v i n g f or N u r s i n g Home Residents A major factor that can precipitate admission to a nursing home, is limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs).
ADLs include: bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, and eating.
In this section of the chartbook, trend data on ADL limitations are from 1992 to 1997.
Comparisons are also made in ADL status between Maryland and nursing home resident data for U.S. nursing homes.
Finally, ADL dependence is examined for nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and subacute care facilities.

Â¦ Almost all nursing home residents receive help with bathing (93 Â­ 94 percent).
Three-quarters or more of nursing home residents received assistance or were dependent in toileting (76 Â­ 82 percent) and transferring (72 Â­ 77 percent).
Â¦ In all ADLs, Maryland nursing home residents are more dependent than the nation as a whole.
Â¦ Of all ADLs measured, nursing home residents are more independent in eating in both Maryland and the U.S.
For the eating activity, almost one-half of Maryland and about 55 percent of U.S. nursing home residents were independent and did not require assistance in performance of this ADL.

Â¦ Overall, there is a trend of decreasing independence and decreasing total dependence across ADLs.
The proportion of residents requiring supervision, limited assistance, and extensive assistance with ADLs increased between 1992 and 1997.
Â¦ Nursing home residents' dependence in transferring and toileting is concentrated at the two extremes of total dependence and independence.
In 1997, about 38 percent of Maryland nursing home residents were totally dependent in the toileting ADL, while 20 percent were independent.
Â¦ Although a significant proportion of nursing home residents are dependent in
bathing, the proportion of residents requiring limited or extensive assistance is increasing, while the proportion totally dependent is decreasing.
In 1997, 31 percent of nursing home residents required extensive assistance for bathing and 51 percent were totally dependent.
Â¦ Nursing home residents' ability to dress themselves is primarily dependent, although there is a slight trend toward less dependence.
Â¦ While almost one of every two nursing home residents are able to feed themselves independently, there is a slight trend toward increasing dependence in this ADL.

Â¦ In the toileting and transfer ADLs, nursing home residents are more likely to be dependent when compared with subacute care and assisted living settings.
Subacute care patients are less likely to be independent, but more likely to require limited assistance.
Assisted living patients are overwhelmingly more independent in both toileting and transfer.
Â¦ In all three settings, the proportion of patients or residents who eat independently is high, ranging from 49 percent in nursing homes to 84 percent in assisted living facilities.
