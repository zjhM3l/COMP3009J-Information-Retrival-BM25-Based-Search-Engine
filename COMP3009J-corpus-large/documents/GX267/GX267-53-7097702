SECTION 1: PROJECT INFORMATION A. PROJECT SPECIFIC Special Note: Nothing in this Scope shall preclude federal agencies or federal officials from fulfilling their responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.
Section 4321, et seq., or any of NEPA's implementing regulations.
A1.1 INTRODUCTION The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) intends the Consultant to perform the necessary environmental study and associated work efforts to prepare the necessary NEPA documents, currently anticipated to include preparation of a Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Record of Decision (ROD), including DEIS, FEIS, and Basic Engineering for the Northwest Corridor.
Sufficient level of design will be required to provide a clear definition of the project, to identify impacts and mitigation measures for the EIS, and to ensure that accurate cost estimates are given.
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is the lead agency for the EIS/Basic Engineering study in cooperation with CDOT.
Work programs, procedures, and products are subject to FHWA review and approval.
A1.2 BACKGROUND Project Description The goal of this project is the examination of interregional transportation needs along this transportation corridor, and the generation of an EIS/ROD which identifies a preferred alternative that best meets those needs, and prepared in coordination with CDOT, RTD, FWHA, local entities, and the public.
Proposed work defined under this contract consists of an evaluation of all reasonable alternatives, including no-action.
Alternatives must consider a full range of possible multimodal options, including possible general transit options, possible improvement of existing roadways, possible new highways and enhancements, possible implementation of a tolling enterprise, as well as Transportation System Management (TSM), and Transportation Demand Management (TDM) items.
Several alternatives are presented in the previously completed "Northwest Quadrant Feasibility Study, Final Report, Management Committee Decision, January 31, 2001 (NWQS)".
Special Note: The noted study represents an informational resource, only.
Neither the mention of this document in this Scope nor the contents of this document are intended to influence the procedures, direction, or results of the environmental studies the Consultant will perform.
It is anticipated that the scope of this environmental study will involve examination of any corridor-relevant (within the limits described in the feasibility study) transportation alternatives appearing in that study.
However, other reasonable alternatives shall not be foreclosed in the environmental study done by the
9
Consultant, and no alternative stated in the feasibility study will be preferred arbitrarily over any other alternative.
Reasonable alternatives must ensure that maximum multi-modal capacity is attained for the corridor's capital investment, possibly including toll lanes, additional replacement/modifications to interchanges and bridges, and improvements to local arterials.
This will ensure that the final preferred alternative is designed to avoid reconstruction if these other improvements are completed at some future date.
Figure 1 illustrates the Northwest Corridor area.
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires that environmental impacts be assessed and considered whenever federal funds are used for major transportation projects.
Preparation of an EIS, ROD, and Basic Engineering allows the Northwest Corridor to qualify for federal funds available through FHWA if needed.
Alternative courses of action are required to be assessed in a comparative form in the preparation of the EIS, and decisions shall be made in the best overall public interest based on a balanced consideration of the purpose and need for the proposed action.
The engineering activities will identify spatial requirements for the alternatives under consideration, refine cost estimates, and provide more detailed design plans for the roadway and transit elements.
The design element will be conducted to the extent necessary for complete impact analysis.
The final deliverables will provide a comprehensive evaluation, designed to meet NEPA EIS and ROD preparation requirements of FHWA, focusing specifically on the environmental impacts associated with development of the identified preferred alternative, and determining the appropriate steps toward mitigation of such impacts, if necessary.
CDOT will work cooperatively with the affected cities, agencies, organizations, residents, businesses, and property owners to identify specific alternatives and mitigation that will best meet the needs of the affected area.
As part of this work effort, CDOT will be conducting an extensive community/public outreach effort dedicated to maintain a proactive dialogue with the citizens of the affected communities and to insure that questions and concerns are dealt with quickly and fairly.
CDOT and local jurisdictions have entered into a partnering agreement which will outline roles and responsibilities in this analysis.
A1.3 PROJECT LIMITS The Project Corridor is approximately bounded by the foothills on the west, Simms Street / 96th Street on the east, the intersection of the Northwest Parkway / Tape Drive / Carbon Road / 96th Street on the north, and the intersection of C 470 / I 70 on the south.
The exact project termini may vary during the systems-level analysis.
A1.4 PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS This scope of work has been prepared to define work to be conducted for preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Northwest Corridor (between Broomfield and Golden).
This project is within the counties of Boulder, Broomfield, and Jefferson.
Sufficient level of design will be required to define the project, to identify impacts and mitigation
10
measures for the EIS, identify corridors for preservation, and to ensure accurate cost estimates.

Special Note: Some or all of the Consultant's possible System Feasibility Study activities may be assigned to take place either antecedent to or concomitantly with activities that are parts of the non-System-Feasibility-Study portions of the Scope.
The purpose of the Procedural-Directive-1601.0-process System Feasibility Study is to provide a comprehensive, responsible, professional analysis under the Procedural Directive 1601 guidelines.
Such a Study is not intended to and will not supplant or contradict any of the results of the NEPA analysis.
A draft study shall be submitted to the PMT for review and comment prior to final submission for transportation commission approval.
C3.3 ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS Develop Alternatives Develop reasonable range of alternatives that may satisfy the purpose and need of project requirements (see discussion in Section A1.2 Project Description).
If a multi-modal alternative is developed, FTA requires approval of a baseline alternative in order to complete the New Starts rating and allow the project to advance to Preliminary Engineering.
FTA's baseline alternative must be carried through to the entire evaluation.
When required, conceptual layouts will be developed for major structures for each alternate that shows satisfaction of the required span arrangement and the horizontal and vertical clearances.
Examples of items to consider while developing alternatives are multiple modes and transfers between them, alternate routes, accident history, congestion, and effects of the interchange on
38
the existing highway system, effects on adjacent interchanges, economic development impact, and local commitment to improving local roadways.
These alternatives must respond to projected design-year traffic volumes as developed for this scope and for projected ridership on bus service.
Evaluate the impacts of these alternative concepts and the degree to which they fulfill purpose and need.
These concepts will be described schematically and narratively, and reviewed by the PMT.
Screen Alternatives A preliminary screening process will be used on the universe of alternatives to identify a limited number of feasible and significantly different alternatives, which will be subject to more detailed evaluation in Section C3.3 "Test Alternatives Analysis".
The purpose of this screening is to eliminate the obviously unfeasible or unsuitable alternatives.
The criteria used in the preliminary screening should include items identified in Section 3, "D", "Gather Data, Analysis, and Mitigation."
Examples of concerns used in the screening process are environmental (air, noise, water quality, parkland, etc.), historic and archaeological impacts, cost and engineering feasibility, construction staging options, transportation impacts, design-year level of service and other performance measures, socioeconomic impacts and community acceptability, consistency with adopted plans, and urban design issues and opportunities.
The no-action alternative must be carried through the entire evaluation and assessment process.
The Consultant shall develop evaluation criteria related to purpose and need for review and approval by the PMT prior to beginning the screening process.
The design alternatives will be described in a final design alternatives memorandum.
For the set of alternatives, horizontal and vertical alignment studies, at a scale of 1"=200', will be examined.
Test Alternatives Analysis Following the development of the short-list of alternatives, the Consultant shall perform a comprehensive test of each of the short-listed alternatives.
This test shall utilize a decision process, which includes a compilation of all appropriate criteria, as established above.
In addition to the socioeconomic and environmental concerns, the decision criteria shall include design standards.
The criteria will be compiled in coordination with other activities.

The Consultant or the CDOT Region Planning/Environmental Manager and the Resident Engineer must compile the information on the project activity that requires the acquisition of the 402 Permit and the general project description as it relates to stream or wetland encroachment for the permit application.
The Resident Engineer will coordinate with the Hydraulics Engineer.
E3.3 SECTION 404 PERMIT The Section 404 Permit is used to obtain compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
A 404 Permit is required whenever construction projects or maintenance activities requiring dredging or filling occurs below the ordinary high-water line in any body of water considered a water of the United States (navigable waters of the United States and adjacent wetlands; all tributaries to navigable waters and adjacent wetlands; interstate waters and their tributaries and adjacent wetlands; and other waters of the United States such as isolated wetlands and lakes, intermittent streams, and prairie potholes).
Ordinary high-water line is defined as that line of the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank; shelving; changes in the character of the soil; destruction of terrestrial vegetation; the presence of litter and debris; or other appropriate means which consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.
The CDOT Region Planning/Environmental Manager is responsible for preparing and submitting 404 Permit applications in coordination with the Corps of Engineers.
The Region Planning/Environmental Manager will transmit the permit application and any permit stipulations required by the Corps of Engineers to affected Region and Staff offices.
Maintenance activities are also regulated.
Permits are obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
There are three levels of permits, generally based on the amount and type of impact: 1.
Individual Permit: A Corps of Engineers authorization that is issued following a case-bycase evaluation of a specific project involving the proposed discharge and a determination
59
that the proposed discharge is in the public interest.
The greater the wetland impacts on a project, the more likely that an Individual Permit will be required.
If an application for a permit cannot be addressed with a Nationwide or Regional permit, then a detailed application must be submitted requesting an Individual Permit.
A 30-day public review is required.
2.
Regional Permit: Permits for activities authorized by the Corps of Engineers on a regional basis.
A 15-day public review is required.
Examples of activities include minor excavations in wetlands and stream habitat improvement projects.
3.
Nationwide Permit: General permits that cover common design elements and/or construction activities.
Specific requirements are attached to each Nationwide Permit.
If certain conditions are met, the specified activities can take place without the need for an Individual or Regional permit.
Each Nationwide Permit contains a description of the permit and may include the size of the area that can be impacted, the quantity of allowable fill, and other relevant information.
A written pre-discharge notification of the Corps of Engineers may be required before work can begin.
The approval process for a Nationwide Permit is fairly easy; however, it can take up to 45 days to receive the permit.
For all these permits, it is important that the Resident Engineer provide the required information in a timely manner to facilitate the approval process.
The Environmental study prepared for the project should identify by alternative the general location of each dredge or fill activity, and determine the impacts and proposed mitigation measures.
All Categorical Exclusion (Minor) projects involving waters of the United States also require 404 Permits and documentation is required using Form 128, Categorical Exclusion Determination.
Construction cannot start without a signed 404 Permit.
The 404 Permit is a legally binding agreement between CDOT and the U.S. Army Corps.
This means that changes in design or changes made in the field that alter impacts cannot be made until all parties have agreed to the changes and those changes have been documented.
