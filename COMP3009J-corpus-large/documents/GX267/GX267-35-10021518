Foreword School Guidance and Counseling Programs nationwide have evolved, over the past few decades, from a limited service approach toward a comprehensive program approach that supports and enhances school district goals.
Traditionally, guidance services were characterized as crisis driven, positionoriented, and serving special populations only.
Today we know that to be truly effective in preparing students to meet the challenges of the future, Prevention, Early Intervention, and Planned Learning Opportunities for all students must be part of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Comprehensive guidance and counseling programs that promote student success through a focus on academic achievement, prevention and intervention activities, advocacy, social and individual learning, and career development, provide students with the skills to resolve problems before they become roadblocks.
Every student needs to approach the educational program ready to learn, and this means having the social and emotional skills to benefit from the educational setting.
Individual uniqueness and developmental growth are supported in a comprehensive program approach.
Such programs focus on the development of students to ensure that they gain knowledge, skills, competencies, and personal habits that will help them to be productive workers in a global economic environment, as well as contributing citizens in society.
The results of a comprehensive guidance and counseling program are enhanced when state and local educational agencies work together to form shared language, vision, and expectations.
This implementation manual was developed through the Department of Education with direct input from guidance and counseling professionals throughout the state and across the nation.
State and national models were reviewed, and information recommended by the advisory group, and other school counseling professionals, was written and adapted for this state manual.
This manual presents a method to develop, implement, and evaluate comprehensive guidance and counseling programs in New Hampshire's schools.
It is organized around the standards of the NH K-12 Career Development Curriculum Framework, available from the NH Department of Education, as well as the National Standards for School Counseling Programs (1997) by the American School Counselor Association.
If all students are to benefit from the positive changes occurring in school guidance and counseling programs around the state, parents, teachers, counselors, principals, superintendents, and school boards must understand the organizational structure a comprehensive guidance and counseling programs and its contributions to student achievement and life success.
In order for New Hampshire to sustain this integrated and developmental approach to school guidance and counseling, all stakeholders related to education need to be familiar with and supportive of the program goals.
These goals, in their turn, must arise from and contribute to state and local educational goals.
It is the intention of this implementation manual to assist school guidance and counseling program personnel to self assess their progress in these areas and take the necessary steps to develop toward a Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Program.

Introduction: The Comprehensive Guidance and Counseling Impact on Student Achievement and Life Success The connection between comprehensive guidance and counseling programs and school academic accountability begins with the establishment of academic standards for students.
Academic standards articulate a common core of knowledge and skills that every student should possess.
They define what each student should know and be able to do in a core set of subjects.
In New Hampshire this core set includes Arts, Career Development, English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies.
These standards provide a solid foundation for future learning and give students, teachers, and parents consistent targets to meet.
Standards form the heart of school improvement.
Academic standards set high expectations that drive curriculum and, when fully aligned with the assessment and accountability system, give schools the information they need to re-evaluate and strengthen their programs.
In 1998, the UCLA Center for Mental Health in Schools published a report to encourage school boards to increase their focus on addressing barriers to learning in America's schools.
The report states that while emphasis on higher expectations, assessment, and accountability is important, it is not enough.
The barriers hindering the performance and learning of students must be addressed through school guidance and counseling programs in partnership with the instruction and management components of the school environment.
Guidance and counseling programs must address whatever interferes with a student's ability to learn, to succeed, and to participate in the learning process.
For this to happen, school counselors must be given the tools to develop the comprehensive guidance and counseling program in their schools.
Student Learning is the Goal of Guidance and Counseling Programs Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Programs set student standards for competencies to be achieved, contain an articulated body of content, and use a variety of strategies to deliver this content to all students.
The program is evaluated and held accountable for its results, as well as for whether certain functions or activities are in place.
The goal of all program content and intervention strategies is learning.
The guidance and counseling program, in collaboration with other programs, is also supports district goals and missions that ensure student learning.
Although the content of school guidance and counseling programs address results such as social and individual adjustment, and educational and career planning, it is how these results enhance learning that supports the existence of the program.
Academic excellence requires personal excellence and the ability of the individual to take full advantage of the educational opportunities available.
Competencies such as study skills, testtaking skills, resource utilization, problem-solving skills, interpersonal and social skills, educational and career planning skills, self-esteem, self-knowledge, career awareness and exploration, employability skills, conflict resolution, communication skills, self management and personal responsibility, and community involvement form a core content of student development programs.

the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program are the means to the development of students who are ready to learn and ready and able to achieve high standards.
School Guidance and Counseling Promotes Readiness for Student Achievement How does the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program promote readiness for student achievement? Figure 1 illustrates a pathway model of the elements of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program that shows the relationships between: (1) "Readiness to learn" (the guidance component) and "Learning in the curriculum" (2) "Learning in the curriculum" and "Measures of student achievement" and (3) "Measures of student achievement" and the desired "outcomes of the educational programs."
According to this model, the initial state of "readiness to learn" involves acquiring skills, knowledge, and attitudes that prepare students for learning challenges at each stage of educational growth and development.

Readiness to Learn Not all students come to school prepared to take advantage of the opportunities to learn from classroom learning environments.
Some lack important knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and this interferes with their capacity to reach their full potential.
In a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, individual, group, classroom, and curriculum integrated strategies help students bridge this gap to achieve self-efficacy as a learner, career and life goals, academic learning skills, and social skills.
Self-efficacy as a Learner: This characteristic refers to a student's self-confidence as a learner.
High achieving individuals believe that they can master the material presented to them in the classroom through their own personal efforts.
They accept responsibility for their own learning.
They look upon curricular areas in which they encounter difficulty as challenges to be met and seek out resources and assistance when needed.
Career and life goals: This element refers to the capacity for students to relate classroom learning to ultimate purposes in life, to the establishing of a career, and to a place in society.
It requires that students become able to comprehend that learning today will have an impact on career and life opportunities in the future.
Career and life goals provide an important aspect of the motivation to achieve in the classroom.
As students apply their learning, they come to understand the relevance of the curriculum.
This becomes increasingly important as students mature.
Academic learning skills: This aspect is often referred to as "learning how to learn."
It involves study skills techniques, general problem-solving abilities (cognitive strategies), focusing and sustaining attention, and listening skills.
This component also includes the development of skills in time management, reviewing and editing, and test-taking.
Classroom social skills: Modern learning takes place in a dynamic multicultural social context.
Teaching and learning techniques have moved beyond only lecture and listening, to a variety of interactive and experiential strategies that require students to use effective collective problem-solving, self-management, and communication skills.
The number one reason that people in the United States lose their job is the inability to work with others.
Therefore students must learn and transfer classroom social skills to the modern workplace in which the capacity for successful collaborative performance is essential.
Acquiring basic human interaction and communication skills thus becomes an important outcome of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Reviewing these components, it becomes very clear how essential a strong comprehensive school guidance and counseling program model is to the mission and goals of any school system.
The ultimate purpose of education is prepare students for the future, a future in which they will actively participate in society both for their benefit and the benefit of others.
A collaborative, developmental approach in every school assures this outcome.

Chapter 1: Beginning Issues in Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Moving from a Position to a Program Orientation A program-focused comprehensive school guidance and counseling program incorporates many of the same specific activities as a position-focused program, such as assisting students with scheduling in a way that optimizes their educational and career path plan, counseling and supporting students in need to help them become ready to learn, and supporting the overall smooth functioning of the school.
However, there is a significant difference between program and position-focused missions.
A comprehensive school guidance and counseling program: Â¶ Â¶ Â¶ Â¶ Â¶ Is seen as an integral part of the school's total educational mission.
Focuses primarily on addressing the developmental needs of all students as the top priority.
Identifies all students' competencies that relate to their corresponding developmental needs.
Plans appropriate work tasks for the counselor with sufficient time to perform them.
Develops and implements a counseling program which assists all students to select, develop, and demonstrate student outcomes.
Â¶ Provides counseling for all students at those times when they have special decisions to make or problems to face.
Â¶ Supports other educational programs, while remaining a separate but equal component of the school's educational mission.
Therefore, a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program displays three important and essential characteristics: 1.
The language describing the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program is focused on student competencies, actions, and knowledge.
In a traditional position-oriented approach, those guidance departments that provide services rely primarily on a description of the services to be provided, but in terms of counselor behavior.
In this case the language is administrative in nature and focuses on tasks the counselor must perform if the school services are to run smoothly.
The description of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program is student-competency oriented rather than counselor position oriented.
The layperson reading this description will have a clear impression of what students will be able to do if the program is successful in achieving its goals.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling

2.
The counselor role is 100% guidance program focused.
From the first day of school in the fall, to the last day of school at the end of the school year, counselor time is spent implementing a program that has student-based competencies, goals and objectives.
Day to day changes in program activities occur through negotiations rather than as add-ons given to the Guidance and Counseling Department simply because no one else seems to have the flexibility in their daily schedule to carry out new tasks.
3.
Counselors have clearly defined and mutually understood relationships with teachers, administrators, and other staff members.
Through the guidance curriculum, school counselors participate fully in the instructional program of the school.
However, they also have specialized and unique skills in human development and counseling.
Through negotiation, counselors and teachers know how they fit together.
Likewise, school administrators appreciating the diversity of skills and approaches, and can foster creative working relationships among counselors, teachers and administrators.
In the comprehensive school guidance and counseling approach, the major complaint of counselors Â­ that they spend too much of their time in activities that they were not trained to perform, and not enough time doing what they were trained to do - is not heard.
The Guidance Curriculum and Career Development as an Integral Part of that Curriculum A comprehensive school guidance and counseling program includes two functions that must not be overlooked or minimized if students are to reach their full potential through their years in school.
The first is that of teaching students, in individual or group sessions, to identify, develop, and demonstrate progress in developmental goals and objectives that the school district has selected as important and age appropriate.
This function now is referred to as the Guidance Curriculum.
The development of the Guidance Curriculum and its learning goals and strategies is determined through a process that is explained in Chapters Four and Six of this manual.
It is specifically aimed at developing and presenting certain learning activities both in and out of the classroom, to help students successfully complete specific guidance objectives that have been deemed vital for them to become fully functioning adults.
In the Guidance Curriculum, teachers, counselors, parents, students and community members have parts to play.
Each of them may act as the primary instructor for a specific learning activity, or along with others, they may contribute by sharing some special knowledge or experience with students.
The second function that a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program highlights is that of Career Counseling and Development, sometimes referred to as career guidance.
Career planning is really life planning - that is, planning one's way through life and toward a successful future.
Therefore, it needs to be addressed in an organized manner in all components of the school guidance and counseling program and as an integral part of the school's educational program.
Chapter Six presents "How to" ideas to help school counselors develop effective comprehensive school guidance and counseling programs that include career development.
Teaming With Other Program Areas and Connecting with Teachers In a position-focused guidance program, an observer might get the impression from the detached physical locations of the guidance area and counselor offices, that the guidance function and the work of the counselors are quite separate from the instructional program of the school.
Where there is a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, students, teachers, other school staff and New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
14
community members view the guidance and counseling program as an integral part of the school's educational program, and the physical location of the program offices reflect this.
This allows teachers and school counselors to more easily share planning and communication responsibilities.
A change of this type calls for commitment by many school staff members to teaming on major functions and programs.
This teaming produces profound benefits for the school and the students, benefits that are not present in position-focused programs.
However, making the change to a team approach is daunting.
Often, to save time or work more comfortably, individual team members are tempted to focus on their own tasks and "go it alone."
This can lead to a return to the old ways Â­ a position-focused program with its limitations and obstacles to success.
It is important that the whole school understands and supports the counselor team approach, and applies patience, fortitude, and support until working together becomes second nature to all team members.
Developing a Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Program as a Team Effort A few beginning steps are helpful in the process of changing from a position-focused guidance program to a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
These include forming an internal steering committee and selecting a committee chair or head.
The steering committee should reflect the collaborative function of comprehensive guidance: all stakeholders should be included.
Representatives from the instructional programs, the administration, support staff, students, and parents result in a strong team that will not overlook important components leading to success.
Leadership of the steering committee is important to focus discussions and keep the momentum flowing while the work continues.
Often, schools select a school counselor, guidance director, administrator, or parent to chair the work of the committee.
It is more important to select someone with leadership skills than to focus the attention on the person who has the most appropriate job title.
The person selected must have a good sense of working in and with groups, must be able to establish a team momentum, and motivate already over-scheduled professionals to go the extra mile.
The Chair will need to understand both school and community environments and the team culture present in the group that makes up the steering committee.
The development and implementation of an emerging guidance and counseling program is highly vulnerable to attempts by individual team members or small groups that may want to establish a program to meet their particular needs.
Remember the goal is to develop a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program that will meet the developmental needs of all students in the various aspects of their lives.
Calling in task-specific consultants to work with local school personnel is very effective.
It establishes a successful foundation when the steering committee involves task specific experts to help with the tasks and to check with the populations that have expectations about the outcomes.
Even though it may involve more time to manage this process, it stands a better chance of helping the school reach its goals without becoming stuck on particular issues or being distracted by the many needs that must be incorporated.
At times, perhaps structured periodically, schools will want an `outside the school' view of their progress and plans.
Some schools have enjoyed connecting with a neighboring school in the `critical friends' model, to obtain input and fresh ideas at points along the way.
Schools can also utilize outside consultants, as needed.
State Department of Education personnel from the Guidance and Counseling Office are available to work with local committees.
Counselor Educators and independent Guidance Consultants are sometimes willing to contract with schools for advice and/or assistance.
Outside consultants from schools that have already implemented some parts of a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program can often be quite helpful, especially when the steering committee needs to hear New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
15
from someone who may have faced the same or similar implementation challenges.
Collaboration during the development stage is the key that will unlock the door to a successful, cooperative future in implementing the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program created.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
16
Chapter 2: Getting Underway First Steps First Guidance and counseling responsibilities need to be clearly defined within any district-wide planning for change.
This means linking the development of a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program to the district's local improvement plan and/or strategic plan.
In accordance with RSA 193-C9, New Hampshire school districts are encouraged to develop a Local Education Improvement and Assessment Plan (LEIAP).
The LEIAP is a written document produced by representative individuals within the school district that describes how the school district plans to build upon and complement the NH state goals of improvement and accountability in education "built upon the establishment of educational standards specifying what students should know and be able to do" as an important element in educational improvement.
The New Hampshire Career Development Framework is a part of this requirement, and should be included as the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program is developed and implemented.
Involving Administrators The building principal's initial and continuing involvement has a great impact on the development, implementation, and success of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
The principal also is the lead person responsible for creating public awareness of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling initiative.
An initial meeting between school counselors and school principal is important to form a shared understanding from the very beginning.
It is the principal whose behavior sends signals to other staff members about the importance of the initiative.
Teachers look to the principal for leadership; they interpret the importance of a new program or strategy by how the principal presents it.
The principal must be out ahead of all, including the counseling staff, in the degree of enthusiasm and commitment to the program.
It is the principal who is most effective in conveying the importance of comprehensive school guidance and counseling programs to the parents and community.
With the principal's continued involvement and support, the program has the greatest chance of success.
The principal and other administrators can help by: Â¶ Providing written and verbal Â¶ Providing time to counselors the deleting of non-guidance the counselors.
Â¶ Providing appropriate and comprehensive guidance and support to others inside and outside of the building.
to develop and implement the new program.
This often entails paperwork or administrative duties that have been assigned to adequate facilities and resources to implement the new counseling program.
17
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
Â¶ Ensuring a valid evaluation of the program on an annual basis according to the written program plan.
Â¶ Providing the connection to the district school board, which will ultimately need to approve the new program, by keeping them updated and informed about the benefits of change.
Plan for Success Start with open conversation and discussion.
Before you begin to plan, have an open discussion with other professionals in your school to determine the need to move into a comprehensive model for school guidance and counseling.
Make sure that everyone understands that a comprehensive model is focused on helping students meet guidance and counseling needs based upon their developmental stage or level.
Avoid the "delegation of tasks" at this point.
The principal should set the meeting time and place and involve all persons who have a vested interest in the agenda and the discussion that results.
There are several topics that need full honest discussion among staff members who hold differing views.
You may decide to use a facilitator for these initial discussions.
Discussion topics may include, but are not limited to: Â¶ The belief that school guidance and counseling is a function of the whole school and intended to meet the needs of all students.
Â¶ The merits of a comprehensive approach to school guidance and counseling Â­ the need for counselors and other school staff members to recognize the importance of the students' educational, individual/social, and career development as a central focus of the school guidance and counseling program.
Â¶ Views and factual information about the percentages of time the current organizational format of the guidance and counseling program provides to various populations and groupings of students, or how the current distribution of time may actually exclude all populations and students.
Â¶ Views on whether the current guidance and counseling program primarily serves the developmental needs of all students, and what organizational responsibilities may be preventing that goal.
Preparatory Steps for the Guidance and Counseling Staff Strategic Plan Review Review your school district's local improvement plan or strategic plan.
On newsprint, try to identify as many common themes as you can that connect to, support, or complement your comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, as you envision it.
Confirming the School Counselor Job Description A well-defined job description needs to be developed using the review process that already exists in your district and based on a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program model.
Chapter 7 in this manual, Figure 7-1, is an evaluation of counselor responsibilities based on a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program model.
You may want to reference this evaluation as a guide, if it becomes apparent that the counselors' job description needs to be rewritten and renegotiated through the district's review process.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling

Achieving a Common Vision Visualize what life will be like when you implement a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program at your school.
Close your eyes for a moment and picture how things will be different - and more positive: Â¶ How students might respond in different ways to each other, to their teachers, and to the tasks students are expected to perform.
Â¶ How teachers might respond as they carry out their assignments with students and connect with parents, Â¶ How students might respond to teaching and counseling activities.
Â¶ How you, as an individual staff member of the school, might respond to students and to other staff members, to parents, and to the community.
Â¶ How you might identify the guidance and counseling needs of students when you view them through a human growth and development perspective; how might these needs differ from the current guidance and counseling program services? Think of other things that might be different in a guidance and counseling program that meets the comprehensive developmental needs of all students in all aspects of their lives.
Brainstorming for Success There are many questions that need to be asked.
The initial counselor group can identify these questions by considering the following items that are generally accepted as keys to success.
As a team, determine and list your thoughts about these items.
Use a flip chart and tape these thoughts around the room as you brainstorm and share understanding of the various elements.
Â¶ Have you determined that change is necessary? Â¶ Discuss and reach consensus on the conditions that are present in your school or district that suggest or require change.
Â¶ Identify the challenges involved in carrying out a change process.
Â¶ Make a commitment to action.
Agree upon and write out the specific items of that commitment.
Â¶ Identify membership for a steering committee, and convene a meeting.
Â¶ Develop trust among those who will become part of the steering committee.
Â¶ Meet with the school board to gain support and secure authorization to develop a written plan for implementing a complete comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Â¶ Discuss major resistances that may become barriers to change.
(Adapted from Gysbers 
Assessing the Current Guidance and Counseling Program As you examine your present school guidance and counseling program, ask these questions: Is the program prepared meet the challenges it will face in the next twenty years? Does it truly meet all the guidance and counseling needs of all of the students in the school, or is it addressing only a single priority area Â­ college admissions or student crises, for example? Is your program the sole responsibility of the counselor(s), or of the total school staff with shared responsibilities? With your group, discuss New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
19
how your program fulfills the following new expectations for a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Â¶ Does your program reach all students? Â¶ Is it integrated within the educational programming of the school? Â¶ Is it comprehensive in scope? Does it include Educational, Individual/Social, and Career Development goals? Â¶ Is it comprehensive in sequence? Does it address the developmental needs of students at the appropriate ages? Â¶ Is it outcome based? Do students identify and enhance their guidance learning objectives as they progress through the grades? Â¶ Is it more prevention than intervention? Both are necessary, but which one is dominant? Â¶ Does it possess a structure that encourages counselors to spend all of their time in counseling, planning, and instruction of guidance outcomes? Â¶ Does it use a steering committee as the primary planning group? Â¶ Are the guidance and counseling program activities planned, scheduled, and announced ahead of time? Â¶ Is the program evaluation based on agreed upon standards and accountable to the school and community? Involving Teachers Teachers also need to be involved in the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program development.
Their involvement and participation can happen at several levels.
Teachers need to be able to see how they might fit into the overall program and they need to be given opportunities to volunteer for active participation in the planning and implementation process.
From the beginning, some teachers will seek or accept a great degree of participation.
But all teachers need to be kept informed and encouraged to participate at a later time.
Often, these teachers who enter later will become more active and the best supporters of this new approach to the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Launching the Steering Committee Once the decision is made to develop and implement a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, it is essential to establish steering committee.
The committee's task is to oversee the development and implementation process.
This collaborative team should include all stakeholders: school counselors, principals, teachers, parents/guardians, students, representatives of the community, and school board members.
Although you want most of the steering committee members to be early adopters of the new initiative, you may want to include one or two "show-me" types.
The reason for this is that once they understand what you are trying to accomplish, they will become strong advocates for the program changes.
The steering committee needs to be seen as a "working committee" that assists with important decision-making, promoting public understanding of program priorities, and future program initiatives.
The steering committee has a very significant role in the success of every step of the development and implementation process.
Each member needs to be solidly in support of the work.
(VanZandt 
Choose your committee members carefully and be sure to include an administrator who will represent the process and decisions to other administrators.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
20
Be certain to keep the community informed about the work of this committee.
One highly effective method for accomplishing this communication is to use the local newspaper or a school newspaper that is shared with the community.
Another effective method is public information announcements on radio or television.
As an integral member of the steering committee, the selected committee chair needs to take an active leadership role.
This means that her/his responsibility extends to convening committee meetings, developing agendas, facilitating the meetings, and assuring that written materials are distributed appropriately.
The chair may delegate tasks, but is responsible for seeing that they get done.
Sharing these responsibilities makes excellent use of the committee members.
Long before the first meeting, generate a list of responsibilities to be taken on by the steering committee.
Distribute this list at or before the first meeting and give attendees time to react to it.
The list may include some of the following tasks: Â¶ Review written material about the school counseling program.
Â¶ Discuss feedback from previous needs assessments.
Â¶ Communicate information about guidance and counseling programs and services to other members of the community.
Â¶ Present the perspective of the constituent group each member represents.
Â¶ Participate in National Counseling Week activities.
Â¶ Offer suggestions and advice about program offerings.
Plan for short meetings with tight agendas, unless you are reviewing extensive documents, and attach any related documents to the agenda.
Be sure that everyone leaves the meetings with clearly defined tasks.
Shortly before the first meeting, think about other agenda items that you will include for first steering committee meeting.
For each substantive item of discussion, the following decisions need to be made: Â· Who is likely to carry the weight of the discussion on these topics? Â· How will you utilize the energy of the entire committee to carry forward the tasks need to be accomplished? Â· How long will the discussion(s) take? Â· What other questions do you need to ask before you hold this discussion/make decision? Â· Will the right people with the authority to make the decision(s) be around the table? your will that this
Once the steering committee is up and running, the members will be responsible for planning all phases of the development and implementation process.
Persons selected for the steering committee need to be able to commit to being chairpersons of various workgroups assigned to address particular objectives and activities.
Ideally, counselors will participate as members on each of the workgroups.
Workgroups may be responsible for such activities as: Â¶ Developing a philosophy of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program to help the program respond to the needs of the students now and in their future.
Â¶ Suggesting a structure of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program that is consistent with the program philosophy.

Â¶ Developing a written plan that aligns with the district's local improvement plan or strategic plan for submission to the District School Board.
Â¶ Conducting a Time and Task Analysis of guidance and counselor program activities, if needed.
Â¶ Developing and conducting a Needs Assessment consistent with the philosophy of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Â¶ Conducting a Resource Audit to determine current activities that can be considered as part of the program curriculum.
Â¶ Using the Needs Assessment results to establish goals and objectives for the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Â¶ Developing an annual and ongoing comprehensive school guidance and counseling program evaluation.
Including All the Players Now is the time to reconsider the importance of including all the players.
If this is not done from the very beginning, you may need to stop and begin again.
For example, if you have published an article in the local newspaper describing that your district is undertaking the effort to build a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, and a community member or parent calls for additional information, be prepared to listen to the concerns.
Consider whether this person would be beneficial as a member of the steering committee but, in any case, plan to keep her/him informed.
Implementing a Program in the Midst of Development One frequent concern on the part of many practicing school counselors is that there is not enough time to do what needs to be done in the current program, and re-structuring seems like a way of adding new responsibilities.
Actually, changing from a traditional reactive, position-oriented guidance model to a proactive, comprehensive school guidance and counseling model involves doing things differently and eliminating non-guidance related activities.
A structured program is likely to run more smoothly.
Normal C. Gysbers, national Comprehensive Guidance and Counseling expert, describes this change process as similar to remodeling a home while living in it.
Among other challenges, it's messy, it takes more time, and we're not sure exactly how it will look when it is completed.
On the other hand, we can see the results emerging, we can make needed changes as the project emerges, and we have brought everyone with us along the way.

Chapter 3: Needs Assessment Simplifying the Process A needs assessment is part of the larger processes of decision-making and program planning and serves many worthwhile purposes.
It is a key factor in program development and evaluation, and contributes to program and staff accountability.
It is also a public relations tool, for it provides an understandable and objective communication channel between school and community and among school staff members.
A well conducted needs assessment can serve as a basis for allocation of resources.
As an important part of the planning process, the needs assessment identifies perceived or expressed needs of the school district and its subpopulations.
The needs assessment helps to determine what is already in place to address the concepts of comprehensive school guidance and counseling.
Gaps or redundancies in the current guidance curriculum will also come to light during the needs assessment, and provide an opportunity for new ideas and methods to be tried.
Through needs assessment, counselors involved in program development are able to identify the program categories and student learning outcomes that students, parents/guardians, teachers, and the community believe are important.
It is one basis for the selection of guidance learning activities that are used to help students acquire the necessary skills they need for their next steps.
A needs assessment seeks opinions about the content of a program.
Because you want to know what people's needs are, you need to ask questions about the issues in their lives that are the most important to them.
You also need to make it clear that your program will not be able to address all of the needs that your needs assessment identifies.
Ideally, a complete needs assessment will be administered in the development phase, in the first year of the program and every third year thereafter.
If the surveys developed are relatively brief and easy to administer, they can be administered to 100% of the student, parent, and school staff population in moderate sized schools (up to 500 students).
In larger schools (above 500 students) a 50% random sampling is recommended.
If it is possible to develop an assessment instrument that may be scored electronically, this will save time and effort and useful, accurate results will be quickly available.
The interpretation of the needs assessment results becomes one basis for selecting student guidance learning activities and curriculum to be addressed by the guidance and counseling program.
It is important that the data be interpreted carefully.
By differentiating the responses of parents, teachers, students, and community members, it is possible to determine whether various groups see similar priority needs or whether different perspectives will need to be addressed in program planning.
If each student respondent also identifies her/his grade level, this information will help the committee to create a developmental comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling

Steps in Conducting a Needs Assessment Utilize a workgroup headed by a steering committee member to:
Â¶ Provide ways for two-way communication between the workgroup and parents/guardians, teachers, school board, etc.
Â¶ Establish general areas of student need to include in the assessment such as educational, individual/social, and career development.
Â¶ Review available data from school records and community agencies.
Â¶ Obtain a demographic picture of the school district's needs and challenges.
Â¶ Identify the community's and school's expectations for the school population in each general area assessed.
Â¶ Collect information about how the current guidance program matches community and school expectations.
Â¶ Summarize the information collected, avoiding educational and counseling jargon.
Â¶ Determine in what ways your new program objectives meet community and school expectations.
Â¶ Identify elements to be assessed and target groups to be surveyed.
Include target groups such as teachers, students, parents, and the wider community.
Â¶ Organize the community and school expectations into a set of higher and lower priorities Â¶ Limit the number of student learning areas to be surveyed.
Focus on those that have been derived from the higher priority expectations of the community or the higher priority areas that require more data for decision-making.
Â¶ Develop the survey instrument and determine the methodology for the survey.
Â¶ Write survey questions that will result in a clear idea of differences and similarities between program objectives and target groups' expectations.
Â¶ Modify wording of items for each target group but, where possible, use similar wording.
Â¶ If the survey is not applied to 100% of the population of each target group, pay attention to how the sample population is chosen.
A representative sample, randomly chosen, will increase the ability to generalize from the sample to the whole population.
Â¶ Don't sacrifice ability to follow-up on non-respondents for anonymity.
If necessary, follow up with non-respondents in order to obtain as complete a picture as possible.
Individual phone and written reminders to each non-respondent are the most realistic procedures.
Impersonal reminders placed in newspapers or at key locations around the community and leaflets distributed at gatherings of target groups are also helpful.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
24
Using Existing Information Below is an example of how existing information may be utilized in the needs assessment, in addition to a survey of target groups.
Other examples of useful existing information may be your school's policy and procedures manuals, your school or district's strategic plan or local improvement plan, the results of the statewide testing program, and other local assessments.
All the information needed exists in one place or another; it is the task of the workgroup to collect, analyze, and use the data in the best possible manner.
Activity: Know Your Community Each community has a unique personality and its own set of characteristics, norms, and issues.
Consider the following list of community characteristics.
A good place for the needs assessment work group to start is to review the information outlined in this list, wherever this information may be available, such as the Annual Town Report.
This is one example of the type of background information that will help the group develop a relevant survey tool.

Informal Needs Assessment Methods Careful reflection on thoughts and suggestions from counselors, teachers.
administrators, and steering committee members can be valid and helpful.
Consideration of available resources, current related programs, school and district priorities, and even "gut level" feelings help in selecting the appropriate guidance curriculum.
Suggestions of other ways to look for information for your informal needs assessment include, but are not limited to:
Â¶ focus groups, Â¶ open ended questions at meetings of parent-teacher organizations, service organizations, etc., Â¶ local newspaper articles, editorials, and letters to the editor that highlight concerns that the school curriculum may need to address, Â¶ district policy and procedures manuals, Â¶ information from outside programs, such as DARE, that are brought into the school.
Using the Results After the results are gathered, the work group will need to determine what procedure will be used for analyzing and interpreting the needs assessment results.
The group will identify the issues and concerns of each of the target groups surveyed, take note of which results indicate differences between program objectives, including student attainment, and target groups' expectations, and form conclusions about what these differences mean.
Subsequent needs assessment surveys can be compared to previous ones to give information about progress toward desired goals.
It may be helpful to follow some of the steps listed here: 1 Translate the needs assessment data into program statements.
This process began during the design of the survey.
Program statements may be organized under the general comprehensive component headings of Guidance Curriculum (classroom and school-wide activities), Individual Planning (appraisal, advisement, placement, and follow-up), Responsive Services (consultation, individual counseling, group counseling, and crisis counseling), and System Support (research, professional development, public relations, committee work, community outreach, program management, and fair-share school responsibilities).
The work group will want to include the full steering committee in this process.
Translate the needs assessment data into the development of a set of 25 to 30 student outcome statements.
Group these statements under the general headings of educational, individual/social, and career development.
The statements, along with or aligned with the appropriate student competencies from state and national frameworks, become the basis for the focus of the offerings of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Organize the objectives (student outcome statements program statements from the survey) from #1 and #2, above, into one of the four comprehensive program components.
Design activities that offer opportunities for the above objectives to be met.
For instance, if the parent and community survey reveals that the public would like more information about what the guidance and counseling program offers, the objective of a program newsletter or webpage can be placed under the component of System Support.

Many of your objectives will likely be focused under Guidance Curriculum, Individual Planning, or Responsive Services.
This is as it should be, as the student's development is the main focus of a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
For each of the student outcomes or competencies included, design activities, or identify activities already in practice, that offer opportunities for student attainment.
Identify areas of the school's curriculum where your team may suggest instruction in the student competencies.
Ask key persons or representatives of key groups to help in the curriculum construction and implementation.
Publicize a clearly written summary of the needs assessment results, and the school's action plan to address these results.
This need not be in great detail, as plan development will take time.
It is better to publicize a timely, easily read summary, than to wait too long.
Show community involvement and seek community support!

Auditing Your Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Program Program Auditing: The comprehensive school guidance and counseling program is one that meets the developmental needs of all students.
Once you have conducted both informal and formal needs assessments, gaps or overlaps in your program will be revealed.
These assessments will tell you whether appropriate curriculum for all levels has been included in the program plans, and when, where, or whether counseling/teaching staff include this curriculum in the ongoing teaching and learning opportunities of the school.
This program audit provides baseline information from which you may develop the scope and sequence of your program.
Process Auditing: It is very important to monitor the process by which the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program is emerging.
Putting a plan into place that keeps track of the developing program will enable you to make mid-course corrections.
One example: counselors and teachers are working together to counteract some bullying behavior between the older and younger students in the school.
An excellent curriculum is available that addresses this issue, but it is designed for grades 5 through 8, and bullying is going on elsewhere.
How do you provide activities to meet the needs of all the students without being repetitious? What other curriculum units are available which address this issue? They may not be titled bullying, and yet some teachers/counselors may have been using them successfully.
As your process builds into a developmental and sequential curriculum, it will be very helpful to keep a chart or graph that places the themes and activities in plain sight.
This will allow you to build seamlessly on previous activities, thus eliminating gaps and overlaps.
Product Auditing: If a student who leaves school on a successful note can be considered our final product, how do we measure success? For many years, schools used percentages of students graduating from high school as the major criteria for success.
We need to pay attention to other factors including, but not limited to, next-step career plans.
One great way to address this issue is to use life/career portfolios, which students develop throughout their school experiences and carry with them after high school.
Another system is a competency-based electronic portfolio, in which student growth, proficiency and mastery can be seen, heard, and viewed over time.

Chapter 4: Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Program Elements The ultimate goal of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program is to assist all students to benefit from their educational opportunities.
This enables them to become fully functioning adults who have developed their talents and abilities and are able to demonstrate them for themselves and for their society.
There are four program components that need to be considered in order to successfully carry out a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program: 1.
2.
3.
4.
Guidance Curriculum Individual Planning Responsive Services System Support and Program Development
Each component addresses the guidance needs of all students and together these four provide the framework for the guidance and counseling program.
The identified needs emerge from the stages of development that all students pass through in their progress from childhood to adulthood.
As they pass through these stages, their needs become affected by the expectation that all students will eventually become members of the workforce, participating in either paid or unpaid employment.
This expectation calls for education and training to enable students to eventually participate fully as self-reliant, contributing citizens.
Each of the program components has a set of expected counselor activities, but also allows counselors to respond to special events, problems, and needs in students' lives.
Certified school counselors, often in collaboration with teachers, implement activities with support and assistance from administrators, students, parents, and other school personnel.
Each component focuses its mission on helping students acquire the skills and knowledge designed for their grade and ages.
1.
Guidance Curriculum The guidance curriculum is a designed and agreed upon set of structured experiences for students.
These experiences are systematically presented in a logical sequence through classroom, group, and individual activities.
The objective of the curriculum is the students' attainment of specific competencies.
These competencies are arranged to reflect developmental needs at each developmental stage.
In the NH K-12 Career Development Curriculum Framework, these types of competencies are organized into three major developmental areas: educational, individual/social, and career.
Student New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
31
competencies from the NH Frameworks, the ASCA National Standards for School Counseling, the National Career development Guidelines, and any others developed through the needs assessment process and specific to the school population's guidance needs can be organized in the same way and listed by grade level.
This results in draft guidance curriculum outline.

From Gysbers and Henderson.(2000) Developing and Managing Your School Guidance Program.
Page 53.
A school-based guidance curriculum is understood in two ways.
Broadly, it refers to all the programs and activities conducted by the school staff and others to help students attain those guidance competencies that will meet their developmental needs.
In this sense many, if not all, teachers are already informally engaged in the guidance curriculum as they carry out their instructional programs.
Identifying where the guidance activities are already being taught is the first step to developing and structuring a formal guidance curriculum.
Those teachers are encouraged to continue; some of them will be the first volunteers to assist in the more formal and structured guidance curriculum.
In a narrower sense, guidance curriculum is a more formal and structured component of your comprehensive guidance program, and is viewed as similar to the English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and other curricula of the school.
School counselors need to serve as the major proponents of the guidance curriculum, but not to the exclusion of others.
The success of the guidance curriculum depends on the degree to which it is "owned" by the total school community.
2.
Individual Planning Individual planning consists of activities that help students plan, monitor, and manage their own learning and their own educational, individual/social, and career development.
The focus is on assisting each student to develop, analyze, and plan educational, occupational, and individual pathways.
This individual planning action usually originates in classroom and group activities, but eventually it becomes the focus of individual sessions with a counselor, teacher/advisor, or career development facilitator.
Individual planning includes an annual review of each student's life-career plan and is often, but not necessarily, connected with the student's course selection.
Individual planning is implemented through such strategies as: Individual appraisal of talents and achievements Counselors assist students to use self-assessment information, along individual/social, and career and labor market information to plan for and realize involvement of counselors with students, parents and the school in developing a meets each student's needs is a critical part of both the individual appraisal advisement activities.
Examples of student goals that call for individual planning limited to, the following: with educational, their potential.
The life/career plan that and the continuing include, but are not
Â¶ Identification of abilities, aptitudes, interests, and achievements that may be useful in future life/career planning, Â¶ Identification of possible careers for further study, exploration, or training, Â¶ High school and college course selection and development of a life/career plan, Â¶ Selection of in-school and out-of-school activities relevant to the life/career plan.
Placement and follow-up
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
33
Counselors assist students in their transitions from one educational level to another, from one school to another, or from school to work.
In order to provide for the needs of all students, counselors focus on providing access to information, advising, helping to establish linkages, counseling in the event of intra-personal conflict, and referral.
Using portfolios One excellent method of assisting students with individual planning is the use of portfolios.
Many elementary and secondary schools today are either developing their own portfolios or adapting ones that have been developed and tested by organizations such as the National Career Development Association or the American School Counselor Association.
Portfolios are a valuable tool in the hands of students.
The portfolio represents the student to her/himself and helps to represent the student to the world.
For example, records of how students make course selections based on career awareness and exploration may be included to remind the students on what basis these decisions were made.
They may use these portfolios to communicate with parents and others by sharing their work in a positive manner.
They may store individual assessment and appraisal results and awards and commendations of any kind in the portfolio for future reference.
Portfolios of the course of individual planning are extremely useful as students transition from school to other goals in higher education and/or the world of work.
As mentioned earlier, electronic portfolios are even more portable.
3.
Responsive Services The responsive services of counseling, consultation, and referral are designed to meet immediate needs and concerns of all students.
Certified counselors have special training and skills to respond effectively, knowledgeably, and in a timely manner.
However, the cooperation and support of the entire staff is necessary for the success of this component.
Responsive services include: Individual and small group counseling In small groups and with individual students, counselors engage in a process of supportive counseling that can range from simple information sharing to interactions that may include problem solving and decision-making.
Other interactions may have preventive and assistance goals.
In general, there are two major reasons for providing individual/social counseling to students: to give short term assistance to those students who are involved in chronic or repeated situations which may present barriers to their school or future career performance, and to provide follow-up assistance to students, individually and in small groups, as a complement to curriculum activities, in order for them to attain their developmental life/career expectations.
Educational development Educational developmental needs that school counselors address through responsive services include student adjustment to school or to the classroom expectations, and assisting to instill desirable and effective study habits or skills, among others.
The focus of responsive services in the realm of educational development positively affects interactive communication skills, problem-solving skills, and skills in self-management.
These tools, or standards of learning, help students to take advantage of the learning opportunities offered.
Individual/Social development New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
34
This area encompasses self-understanding and the understanding of how to work with others.
Management and resolution of student conflicts with peers, family, teachers, and other authority figures, shyness in classroom responses, and apparent low self-esteem, are examples of the issues that school counselors address in individual and social development.
Career development Career development helps students to better understand themselves and their world as they progress through the educational environment and transition to adult life.
Some examples of responsive services in this area include, examination of intra-personal obstacles that may hinder students from understanding and realizing full potential, and assisting students to develop the ability to set goals, consider options, and make decisions.
Crisis counseling Counseling and support are provided to students and the school community facing emergency situations or traumatic events.
Crisis counseling is normally short term and temporary in nature.
Some crises may call for an immediate involvement of community agencies either because of the scope of the crisis or because of the work commitment of the counselors.
Although it is recommended that each school/district develop a crisis team which includes relevant school personnel and representatives from community agencies, it is likely that the school counselors will be involved in some way when a crisis occurs.
It is also extremely important for every school to develop and be able to implement a plan to cope with an unexpected and disastrous event that may be overwhelming.
School counselors have a responsibility during the implementation of the crisis plan consistent with their role and expertise.
Consultation School counselors consult with students, parents, teachers, other educators, and community agencies.
There are many and varied circumstances that call for consultation.
The consultation that happens as a responsive service generally occurs when the situation or problem faced by a student calls for more than individual supportive counseling or simple referral to an outside agency.
Consultation with a student provides the opportunity to share information that could help the student, devise strategies of personal intervention when such intervention is appropriate, and assess and evaluate the results of a personal intervention undertaken earlier.
Consultation with school staff can help to enhance effectiveness in working with students and parents.
Consultation with parents can help them to communicate more effectively with school staff or children.
Consultation with community agencies can help families obtain assistance for some particular situation.
School counselors do not engage in consultation unless the appropriate permissions regarding confidentiality have been obtained.
Referral Counselors often refer students and their parents to community agencies.
This works more smoothly when the guidance and counseling program has developed an easily accessed and annotated list of the referral resources available in the community.
Even more important is maintaining this list, continually updating it, and developing formal and informal relationships with members of these agencies.
At any given time, a counselor needs to be able to call the appropriate agency and, without breaking confidentiality, consult on a situation or presenting problem.
As school counselors become aware of and committed to providing for the needs of all students through a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, they must identify and use more of the existing community resources.
4.
System Support and Program Development New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
35
System Support and Program Development consist of management activities that establish, maintain, and enhance the total comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Activities in this component provide support both to the guidance and counseling system itself and to the school system as a whole.
This component is carried out through activities in the following areas: Research and Development Guidance program evaluation, follow-up studies, and the continued development and update of guidance curriculum activities are three of the research and development activities that are constant and ongoing.
Professional development School counselors need to be involved regularly in updating their professional knowledge and skills.
This may involve participation in school in-service training, attending professional meetings, completing post-graduate work, and contributing to professional literature.
Teachers also need staff development involvement to help them carry out their role as a member of the guidance curriculum team.
State re-certification in school guidance counseling requires a professional development plan that is consistent with local improvement goals and with increasing expertise in the field of school counseling.
Participation in professional development activities must be documented and verified.
Specific information is available at the Department of Education website: www.ed.state.nh.us/Certification/teacher.htm.
Staff/Community public relations Orienting the school staff and the community to the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program through such means as the use of newsletters, local media, and school and community presentations, is the main focus of staff and community public relations.
It also includes parent involvement activities, and activities designed to increase parents' and community members' knowledge of and comfort in attending school guidance and counseling sponsored events.
Community/Advisory Boards Serving on departmental curriculum committees and community committees or advisory boards are examples of activities in this area Community Outreach Included in this area are activities designed to help counselors become knowledgeable about community resources, employment opportunities, and the local labor market.
This may involve counselors visiting local businesses and social service agencies on a periodic basis, or hosting visits to the school.
It also includes connections with community agencies for setting up networking and referral linkages.
Program Management and Operations This area includes the planning and management tasks needed to support the activities conducted in a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, such as reviewing and updating budget, equipment, and facilities needs.
Fair Share Responsibilities All members of the school staff have a share of responsibility in ensuring that the organization runs smoothly and efficiently.
Fair share responsibilities may not have a direct connection to activities New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
36
that school counselors believe are related to their training and expertise.
However, they do afford school counselors an opportunity to observe, interact with, and form relationships with students in various settings.
An example is `lunch duty'.
Although this is not a counseling activity, many school counselors use this time to connect with students informally and create friendly connections between and among students.
Fair share responsibilities should not require a disproportionate amount of the school counselor's time, or the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program will suffer.
Staffing Patterns: Who Does What? In figure 4-1 is a chart called "Suggested Distribution of Total Counselor Time/Percentage Rate".
This chart suggests the best practice in allotting time for particular aspects of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Of course, schools will vary depending on their specific needs and challenges, but if they veer too far from the recommended percentages, they run the risk of losing the comprehensive nature of the program.
Too often, one aspect of need will take precedence until others are almost excluded.
When this happens, it is a signal or `red flag' that staffing patterns are out of alignment and some discussion and re-negotiation needs to take place.
Solutions may include hiring a paraprofessional for the non-guidance but guidance-related duties, developing a community-agency collaborating crisis team to assist with unusual, severe student crises, more counselor/teacher teaming for guidance curriculum delivery, hiring of counselor/therapists on a yearly contracted basis for specific IEP-designated therapy, and forging close, collaborative ties with several community counselors and agencies for referral of the students needing long-term therapy.
The New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules (Ed 306.17, 1996), which has the force of law, specifies exactly the caseload ratio of students to school counselor.
For elementary schools, the ration is 500 students per full time counselor.
This means that if an elementary school has 600 enrolled students they need one full time counselor plus another counselor one day a week.
For middle/jr. and high schools, the staffing ratio is 300 students per full time counselor.
These ratios are part of the minimum standards for school approval and must be implemented by the local school boards.
The ASCA national recommendations for student/counselor ratios is 250/1.
Many national research studies have shown that counselor/student ratios of 225/1 result in increased academic achievement by students.
In the percentage chart, the time spent in the various comprehensive components varies according to grade level.
These designations, which are acknowledged nationally, were based on developmental needs.
For instance, the guidance curriculum is allotted a greater proportion of the counselor's time on the elementary level than it is on the high school level.
This is because individual planning, which includes appraisal, advisement, placement, and follow-up, comprises a greater proportion of time in the higher grades.
This individual planning builds on the foundation that the guidance curriculum of the lower grades has established, by assuring that students have the educational, personal, interpersonal, and social skills they need to take advantage of college and career development activities through individual planning.
Resources Human Although counselors are the main providers of and coordinate the comprehensive guidance and counseling program, the involvement, cooperation and support of the teachers, administration, and other school staff members are key elements of a successful program.
In addition, the involvement, cooperation, and support of parents, community members, and business and labor are critical for full student participation in the program.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling

Financial The financial resources categories required for a successful program include budget, materials, equipment, and facilities.
Just as any program area in the school requires a budget, so does the school guidance and counseling program.
This budget is needed to fund and then allocate those funds across the buildings and grade levels within the district.
Materials and supplies are needed so that guidance and counseling activities can be fully implemented throughout the program.
A comfortable and private room for individual aspects of the program, and a community space for group aspects is also needed for the implementation of a comprehensive program.
Political The political resources of a comprehensive guidance and counseling program include district and school board policy, state and federal regulations governing education, and professional association statements and standards.
Clear school board policies are needed for the successful operation of school guidance and counseling programs.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling

Chapter 5 Conducting and Using The Time and Task Analysis The time and task analysis serves as a valuable resource.
It is positive evidence of how time is spent in the guidance program.
This is extremely useful when auditing the program to investigate how much time is spent on non-guidance duties and where adjustment of time spent on various components needs to be made.
It is a communication tool, with concrete, observable evidence, that helps focus discussions on negotiating duties and time.
Once a comprehensive program is established, the periodic time and task analysis serves as an accountability tool.
This method is an option if a time and task analysis is useful to your process.
If doing the time and task analysis prevents moving forward with the rest of your implementation, please consider which starting points for implementation of change are most important to benefit your particular school system! It is most beneficial to begin the time and task analysis early in the school year Â­ as early as the guidance responsibilities begin.
Since many guidance programs begin with an out-of-school planning session in late summer, even before school opens, this is a good time to start recording time and tasks.
The analysis may begin at any time of the year, however, as the recording of time and tasks would continue until a full year's analysis had been accomplished.
A sample recording sheet is included for convenience and a self designed record sheet would work just as well.
The example included in this manual covers much more than a regular school day, in order to capture the important after-school work done through the guidance program.
While this record will demonstrate that there are evening obligations, it may also bring to light workload issues that require constant extra hours.
Before beginning this recording and analysis, the guidance staff and the steering committee should replace the "examples of activities" with specific activities that your program accomplishes.
Determine which activities belong in which cells, using a brainstorming procedure.
Agreeing ahead of time and checking in as you progress will save a lot of time and make your final report more credible.
It's a good idea to keep all stakeholders informed of this step and of what you are trying to accomplish through the time and task analysis.
Consider using these steps as you conduct your time and task analysis: New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
39
Â¶ Select one day a week for the entire school year, 36 days in total.
A clear way of organizing is to start with a Monday on one week, continue on a Tuesday for the second week, and so on.
Â¶ Use the Time and Task Analysis Log to keep track of the time you spend in various activities, at 30-minute intervals.
Although check marks will suffice, little notes or abbreviations in the cells will result in a more specific picture of the work.
Â¶ Count the total number of 30-minute daily blocks of time for each school day that is being logged.
Do not count times when you were not on duty, for example lunch or personal errands.
Â¶ Next, count the number of 30-minute block intervals for each category.
Record these figures in the appropriate cells in the time block totals at the bottom of the log.
Then calculate your percentages for the day in each category by dividing the total daily category blocks of time by your total daily blocks of time.
Â¶ On the Time and Task Analysis Summary sheet, record the number of 30-minute blocks of time for each of the 36 weeks of the school year, or at the end of each grading period.
Â¶ At the end of the Time and Task Analysis Summary sheet, total the blocks of time by category.
Calculate the percentages of time spent in each category.
Do this by dividing each total category block by the grand total number of blocks.
Try to keep your work on the same page for tallying purposes.

Using the Results Even with just a few weeks of Time and Task Analysis, changes needed in day-to-day operations begin to emerge.
If, through the steering committee, the school and community have been kept aware that changes are planned, small steps toward this change can occur immediately.
At the New Hampshire School Counselor Association Fall Conference in October 1999, Norman Gysbers said, "If you do not attend to the structure within which you work, it will attend to you."
By working with the steering committee and ensuring that all school guidance and counseling staff agree on these changes, small changes applied early on allow the group to "test the waters" and fine tune long-range plans.
Activity: Best Use of Counselors' Time Working with the steering committee, try to determine, from the Time and Task Analysis information, if the activities listed are the best use of the counselors' time.
Among the list of activities will be counselor-specific duties, professional duties, fair-share responsibilities, and non-counselor/nonprofessional duties.
When examining the fair-share responsibilities, those duties that assist the smooth running of the organization and in which all staff members have some share, strive for balance.
If possible, make those in which school counselors are involved as non-disciplinary as possible, so that when counselors meet with the students in class, group, or individual counseling, they are not perceived as antagonists.
The steering committee should assist to determine a list of fair share responsibilities.
Carefully examine the information to identify non-counselor/non-professional duties listed in the Time and Task Analysis.
For each one, discuss, within the steering committee, who else might take on or share in this responsibility? What would they have to give up in order to do this? What professional activities could the counselors spend time on if these identified responsibilities were given up or shared? If, in the final analysis, it is determined that the school counseling staff are the only ones in the school prepared to conduct a particular responsibility, can a way be developed to do it more efficiently? Ask your advisory committee to brainstorm with you some solutions to this challenge.
You may want to create a grid similar to the one in figure 5-1 to begin to address these issues.

Examining the Structure When the percentages of the Time and Task Analysis have been calculated, they can be compared to the recommended "Suggested Distribution of Total Counselor Time/Percentage Rate" in figure 4-1.
This analysis can be shared with the steering committee to stimulate thinking about necessary revisions and reorganization in the structure of the guidance program.
Once the information is collected, it should be communicated in a format that clearly demonstrates the needs of the program.
If the school guidance and counseling staff and the steering committee have been able to chart the activities accomplished within the four dimensions of the school guidance and counseling program and, at the same time, agree upon those activities that are clearly someone else's or a shared responsibility, they will be able to move on to the next step of designing the new structure.
Figure 5-2 gives you a method for charting your new responsibilities.
Projected on an overhead or in a power point presentation, your descriptive dialogue will be very convincing.
These conversations and negotiations of structural change may happen over time, and the results will become a part of the comprehensive plan.
It is helpful to think in terms of "less of" certain things and "more of" other activities, in order to reach a balance in the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.

The change from the current structure to the proposed structure requires careful planning.
There are several steps that help to divide a big task into manageable components, listed below.
This is not an exhaustive list.
Each school may have a process that includes steps important to their particular educational community, and individualization of this process is encouraged.
1.
Compare your present time and task analysis to the proposed program time allocations.
Note the discrepancy between the under-served and over-subscribed.
Within each component, isolate those activities causing the discrepancy.
2.
Plan activities to bolster under-served components and to reduce activities in over-subscribed components, following the suggested time allocations for each component.
3.
Note those non-guidance administrative activities you are providing and the time they consume.
4.
Propose methods for removing non-guidance activities from the present program so that the counselors' time can be better used in the new proposed program.
Administrators need to be included in this step.
5.
Specify the changes needed to implement a comprehensive guidance and counseling program, and develop a plan to accomplish program improvement.
6.
Develop a timetable for implementation of the proposed program and removal of non-guidance activities.
7.
Present the information through your steering committee to your administration, and through your administration, to your school board and through your school board to your community.
8.
Begin building-level program improvement, keeping everyone informed about these changes through your steering committee and any other means that you have at hand.
9.
Expand the leadership base appropriate to the needs of your emerging program.
As you make the transition to the newly designed comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, communication skills are a highly important tool for success.
Working With Your Administration About Your Guidance and Counseling Needs Administrator involvement is critical to the successful implementation of a comprehensive program.
Counselors need to foster a climate of professional rapport and gain the support of their administrators for the development of their program.
Build professional relationships with administrators and practice the following : Â¶ Develop and maintain a trusting relationship with your administrator by demonstrating your professional knowledge and skills.
Â¶ Listen well and carefully to recognize areas of need identified by the administrator.
Â¶ Articulate the connection of a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program approach to addressing school needs/goals.
Â¶ Provide research-based information relating the success realized in schools with fully implemented comprehensive school guidance and counseling programs.
Â¶ Articulate the program's alignment with national and state standards.
Â¶ Share the benefits of a comprehensive program for all stakeholders (students, parents, teachers, and community) with your administrators.
Â¶ Model the integration of guidance curriculum within the existing curriculum (English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and others) in your school.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
46
Â¶ Increase awareness of the New Hampshire Career Development Framework and identify its connection to your comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
Â¶ Collect data to support the need for a comprehensive program and its usefulness in meeting school/student needs (referrals, attendance, discipline, counselor activity log, academic achievement, parent/community concerns, etc.)
Above all, school counselors need to consider awareness as a process that needs continued attention, to recognize the effects of change on individuals and the school, and to continually invite and involve administrators in the process of developing and implementing a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program Â­ pointing out the benefits to all along the way.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
47
Chapter 6: Program Resources There are at least five critical areas of resources that must be provided if your comprehensive school guidance and counseling program is to move from a position orientation to a program orientation.
These areas include: Steering Committee, Staff Assignments and Staffing Patterns, School Counseling Materials and Equipment, Program Facilities and Space, and the School Counseling Budget.
The first two address the human resources that assure smooth operation of the program goals.
The second two areas listed are the material and space considerations that enable the work to be accomplished.
Locating and Activating Resources Personnel and Support: Steering Committee: This committee consists of members who have broad insights into the local community and into parental expectations for students, as well as the various needs of the school community.
Because this is also a working committee and will divide into task groups, individuals need not only special talents and expertise, but also willingness to tackle and remain with special assignments until they are completed.
Although the steering committee may meet as a whole only once or twice a semester, subcommittee task groups may meet as often as once a week.
One way to develop steering committee coherence is for the committee as a whole to identify the tasks that need to be done, and then to insure that everyone on the committee is a member of a task group.
If it turns out that an identified task is not being addressed, the committee may want to add individuals with expertise in that particular area.
Tasks to be addressed may include, but are not limited to: Needs Assessment Resource Assessment Community Advocacy Program Evaluation Curriculum Development Staff Assignments and Staffing Patterns: Four factors need to be kept in mind relative to the successful management of a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
1.
Participatory management practices are recommended.
This approach to management is based on the premise that employees are more enthusiastic and produce more efficiently if they have a role in solving problems and making the decisions that they will carry out.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
48
2.
Counselors with management responsibilities require a lower counselor to student ratio.
When the program management function is assigned to a counselor, the expectation is that the student case load of that counselor will be reduced to whatever level is appropriate for effective management, and that no other counselor will assume a case load that exceeds that required by the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules.
3.
Staffing the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program includes sufficient administrative assistant or clerical support to enable the program to achieve its objectives.
Over time, professional counselors in a school setting can `collect' duties that are best completed by support and paraprofessional staff.
School districts will find it most cost effective to ensure that the program has sufficient support staff for the completion of these responsibilities.
Guidance program paraprofessionals and secretaries fulfill essential roles and also need support in the form of clear and uncluttered job descriptions.
As with counselors, secretarial time assigned to the guidance program needs to be spent on tasks that lead to attaining guidance program goals.
4.
Identifying the special skills of staff members is helpful in providing quality activities.
This may be a place where differentiated assignments of counselors and other staff members could best serve the program and provide staff with the opportunity to use some special talent or training.
Materials and Space: Materials and Equipment: The materials that must be available to you and your staff as you change your program from reactive to proactive are as important as the human resources.
Consider beginning with a survey of guidance and other school equipment and materials that you may use in your program.
As a part of this survey, counselors and teachers are given the opportunity to include any equipment and materials that are currently available and any that are to be purchased.
Steps in Assessing Current Guidance Program Resources: 1.
Gather information about the present state of your current program using the perspective of the four guidance program components.
In this assessment, the resources include space, equipment, materials, use of community resource persons and agencies.
2. Use the four Guidance Components (Guidance Curriculum, Individual Planning, etc) to organize this review of resources.
For each Guidance Component, list objectives, the methods used to reach those objectives (curriculum activities, counseling strategies, etc.), and the resources needed to apply each method.
3.
Taking each of the resources listed above one by one, list on separate sheets of paper, in three columns: a) available now, b) are now in use, and c) need to procure.
4.
Develop a plan to organize those resources you have available and to procure those you do not have.

Facilities and Space: Your comprehensive guidance and counseling program will require an area that is appropriate for housing human and material resources.
You will need to assure that your center: 1.
Will house appropriate personnel, resources, and equipment 2.
Is easily accessible to all students including those with disabilities 3.
Is equipped with up-to-date equipment and materials 4.
Contains a soundproof, confidential area for counselors 5.
Includes a well organized and displayed collection of guidance resource materials and the equipment needed to use the materials.
Activity: Designing Program Facilities and Space On a piece of graph paper, (You may want to use newsprint sized graph paper.)
chart your current guidance and counseling resource center.
Indicate where small and large group meetings take place, where equipment and resources are located, and how access is gained.
On a second piece of graph paper, chart a proposed comprehensive guidance and counseling center, one that will meet the requirements of your new program.
Ask yourselves how these are different.
Brainstorm how you will move from your current center to your proposed center.
What is your first step? Guidance Program Budget: As your program is defined and takes its place with other established programs, (e.g. Mathematics, Language Arts, etc.) an adequate comprehensive guidance and counseling program budget needs to be established.
The budget will reflect all resource needs of your program if it is to achieve its place within the school program.
In order to make this happen, the guidance program budget needs to be separate and distinctive from the administrative budget and stand on its own merits.
Those expense items that are common to all sections of the school's program are included in the administrative budget.
Examples include staff development, professional subscriptions, computer hardware, etc.
Only items that are pertinent to the guidance program need to be included.
Working with your steering committee as you design your budget, reflect the resources needed to provide a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program to all of the students in your school.
By utilizing the four guidance components, you will be able to relate your budget items to the new program plan.

Integrating Activities into the School and Guidance Programs Once you have completed your formal and informal needs assessments, you will be able to identify specific guidance objectives that need to be done in classrooms or small groups.
Step one: Clarify from your needs assessment which of the needs to address.
Your steering committee might decide to take one of the top three needs that have been identified and brainstorm how, when, and where to integrate this into the guidance and counseling program.
Using your best brainstorming techniques, your committee will arrive at a consensus before implementing your strategies.
Step two: Clarify which student needs will be addressed in which program components.
The way a particular need is addressed is up to the counseling staff in conjunction with the steering committee.
Step three: Find places within the total school program and in the guidance and counseling program where these needs may be addressed.
Many teachers and staff members not only find places where this need may easily be infused, they may already be doing it.
If they are, then counselors may serve as resources.
As an example, imagine that students, parents, teachers, and community members have identified several areas that, upon further analysis, appear to reflect a need for conflict resolution.
These identified needs: 1) Peer pressure, 2) Resolving conflicts and making compromises, 3) Help for transfer students, and 4) School adjustment, all indicate that many students are having difficulties getting along with others.
There are several excellent programs that have been developed to address the challenge of helping students get along with others.
A first step in tackling this challenge might be for one or several of your counseling staff to attend a staff development program that addresses one or more of the issues described and to return from this program with new strategies to address the needs.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
51
An Example of How Integration of Activities Takes Place: Guidance Curriculum: If the challenge, such as the one described above, is a school-wide or districtwide problem, then your steering committee will want to address the challenge in a comprehensive developmental manner that pervades your entire system.
Let's use "preventing bullying" as an example.
In this case, The Kindness Campaign, (Weinhold, 2000), is a good example of a developmental, whole school approach to the challenge.
Once your chosen resource has been identified, consider developing a matrix that reflects how and where the activities will be introduced.
To avoid repetition, indicate exactly what activity and method is being used at each level.
Individual Planning: Perhaps the bullying behavior is not generalized throughout the school, but appears to be concentrated in one grade or at one level.
As with any other need that appears to be more specific, you and your team will want to develop strategies that can be utilized either in a classroom, a small group, or perhaps even with an individual student.
Responsive Services: An example of using responsive services to deal with bullying may be if the student is in danger of harming him/herself or others.
Here is where the counseling, consulting, and referral skills of the counseling staff may involve the crisis management team.
System Support: Recently, through both local and national events, a concern about the safety of students in the schools has arisen.
Policies to address these issues may already be in place locally, through school, district, or statewide policies, or through national regulations, such as the No Child Left Behind Act.
This is an example of a system support approach to the challenge.
Sources of Useful Resources and Successful Practices Many school counselors are either using commercial programs or have developed excellent program activities.
A small random sample of New Hampshire school counselors related that they preferred to create their own tailored programs rather that to use "canned" programs.
Creating your own in each area takes time and resources, however, so it is useful to canvas what is available and perhaps build or adapt from that.
Increasingly, there are web sites that describe resources and curriculum materials.
For example, a quick search of Education World located Ten Web Sites for Exploring Conflict Resolution in the Classroom with links to approximately 600 separate and distinct publications.
In New Hampshire, the Keene Curriculum Materials Library at the Keene State College loans guidance and counseling materials on many subjects to any NH educator - conveniently, through the mail!

Figure 7-4 Steps in Developing a Guidance Curriculum 1.
From the list of need statements, generated out of the needs assessment, develop a priority list of learning objectives that will address the identified needs.
2.
Using the set of learning objectives, develop a set of corresponding outcomes.
Some objectives will have several outcomes.
3.
With the help of your steering committee, establish a priority list of outcomes for the present or the next school year.
Be certain that you inform the total school staff, parents, students and community of this list and how the priorities were selected.
Cross reference with state, district, and building goals.
4.
Engage the total school staff in publicizing these priorities as top priorities for all school staff and students.
If possible, create a "theme" for the school year, semester, or grading period.
Use common and age appropriate language.
5.
Link these priorities to the various program components.
Most learning objectives will require a multi-faceted approach, integrating many within school courses and extracurricular activities while also assigning them to multiple components of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program.
6.
Identify a preferred delivery system for each learning objective.
Most will be introduced in one instructional situation (example: classroom) but will be developed, reinforced and supported by other instructional situations (examples: individual planning session, or as part of a subject-matter course.)
7.
With the teaching staff who have already agreed to assist, determine appropriate instructional formats and strategies for each learning objective (figure 6-3); select and/or create curriculum units and activities to teach the specific learning objectives to classrooms, small groups, or individuals (figure 6-4).
8.
Develop a matrix that reflects how, when, and where the learning objectives will be introduced; and where they will be developed and reinforced (examples: elementary, middle, senior high or grades K Â­ 3, 4 Â­ 6, 7 Â­ 9, 10 Â­ 12.
9.
Similarly, identify the specific components of the comprehensive school guidance and counseling program that will introduce, develop, and reinforce each of the guidance learning objectives.
You may want to develop a similar matrix.
10.
Develop a school year schedule for the assignment of learning objectives teaching and obtain the necessary commitments both from school staff members and for resources and time.
Create specific criteria that prove outcome success.
The following Example with its useful activities (using bully-proofing as the subject area) are included to give a visual reference of how Classroom Guidance and Counseling activities may be designed and implemented.
Your program may decide to use a format and style that works best for your school and population.

Lesson #1 Survey on Bullying Note: This is a sample lesson from a unit developed by school counselor Jan Wiley specifically for this model.
Outcome Statement: Both adults and students will become aware of the extent of bullying in their school by completing and receiving feedback on a survey about bullying.
Grade Level: All Task: Students and adults will complete an anonymous survey on bullying in their school.
Materials: Copies of the survey for each student.
Number 2 pencils.
Note: The following have excellent surveys Â­ Maine Project Against Bullying Â­ sauflers@lincoln.midcoast.com, The Bully-Free Classroom by Allan Beane, Dr. Rigby's website Â­ profread@pipeline.com.au, or a simple survey can be created by the counselor asking pertinent questions about his/her school as long as questions about extent of the problem, frequency of intervention and knowledge of parents about their child's school experience are included.
Procedure: 1.
Tell students that you are seeking information to help deal with the problem of bullying in their school.
2.
Tell them that the survey is anonymous.
They are not to put their names on the survey.
All students should use the pencils supplied to complete the survey.
3.
Ask the students to read each question carefully, to think about each question before answering and to answer as honestly as they can.
4.
Provide a definition of bullying before students begin.
5.
When students have finished, collect the surveys, thank them for their participation and tell them that you will return next week (or as soon as the results are done) to discuss the results.
6.
You may wish to remind students of your referral procedure in case anyone wishes to discuss a current bullying situation confidentially.
Follow-up: It is crucial to disseminate the results of the survey as soon as possible.
Evaluation: Students can be evaluated on following classroom rules for participation.
Survey results can be evaluated by how useful the information is in formulating a plan.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
56
Lesson #2 Discussion About Bullying Outcome statement: Through discussion about the results of the survey taken in lesson one and in answer to the counselor's discussion questions, the students will learn information about bullying both in their school and in the world at large.
Grade level: All - with adjustment in language for grade level.
Note: Because high school students are more reluctant to discuss bullying in large groups, the counselor may choose to present responses to survey and use the discussion questions in smaller groups.
Task: Counselor will share results of survey completed in lesson #1.
Counselor will lead a discussion using questions which he/she thinks are pertinent to her/his school..
Materials: Copies of the results of the survey completed previously.
Procedure: 1.
Remind students of the survey completed in lesson #1.
2.
Tell them that you are there to share the results.
3.
Go over the results of the survey.
4.
Ask if students have any questions.
5.
Using your list of questions, lead a discussion that will tie together your school's data and the research on bullying.
6.
Ask each student what he/she learned during today's discussion.
Follow-up: Writing on the topic of bullying can be done through journals, in articles for school newsletters, or as general writing assignments.
Groups can be formed for discussion of interventions (though this might be better done after lessons #3 and #4).
Evaluation: Students can be evaluated on following class rules during the discussion.
Writing samples can be evaluated for knowledge of the topic.
Observation of ability to work together in the small group and large group discussion is also a valuable assessment point.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
57
Lesson # 3 Responding to Bullies Outcome statement: Through discussion and role-play students will learn several ways of responding to disrespectful treatment.
Grade level: K-6 Materials: The Bullying Quiz from Beane (1999).
Book to be read to class.
See resource list for titles of books for children and grade level.
Poster paper and markers for 4 or 5 groups.
Procedure: 1.
Optional - Administer the bullying quiz to set the stage.
2.
Read the book (which you have chosen from the resource list) aloud to a point where the bully in the story is threatening someone.
3.
Stop here and ask for ideas about how the target feels and how he/she can respond.
Brainstorm and list suggestions.
4.
Teach the concepts: " If Someone Treats you Disrespectfully, You Could...."
5.
Return to the story and ask volunteers to role-play the target using one or more of the ideas learned in #3.
(It is better for the counselor/teacher to take the bullying role.)
6.
Complete the story to see how it is resolved.
Follow-up activities: Students could write their own stories using what they have learned and share them with younger students.
Posters can be created and posted throughout the school reminding students of the choices they have in responding to bullying.
Evaluation: Students can be evaluated on the following of classroom rules during the presentation and o the student's ability to work together as a team.
Evaluate the difference in student responses in #3 and # 5 in the procedure.

Lesson # 4 Bystanders Barry K. Weinhold (2000) tells that when Tom Brown (1999) interviewed students for his Broken Toy Project, he asked students what three things kids do when they see someone being bullied.
This is what they answered: Run over and watch, run over and watch and run over and watch.
Herein lies an important piece of the problem.
The majority of our students are not bullies, are frustrated about bullying, say they want to help, but lack the skills to intervene.
These students can significantly reduce bullying by the ways in which they react to it.
We need to teach those skills to our students if bullying is to be reduced.
Some of the skills include refusing to watch bullying, reporting bullying incidents, and/or using distraction with either the bully or victim.
One of the few resources to address this important aspect is the work out of Wellesley College (Quit It!, BullyProof, and Flirting or Hurting) The following lesson plan adapts some of the ideas found in those curricula.
Outcome: Students will learn skills to take appropriate action when they witness incidents of bullying or harassment.
Grade Level: K-6 with teachers adapting language for grade level.
Note: Since research shows that high school students do not participate as readily in large group discussions about bullying, but since it is important to address this issue at that level, counselors are referred to Flirting or Hurting? (Stein,1994) for age appropriate approaches.
Task: The students will complete the "Courage by Degrees" intervention adding their own where applicable.
handout and discuss the steps of
Materials: A copy of "Courage by Degrees" for each student.
Video on bullying.
Procedure: 1.
Start the lesson by showing clips from a video or filmstrip or reading from one of the books for children mentioned in the resource list.
(Optional) 2.
Introduce the concept of the bystander using data gleaned from your research review.
3.
Ask the students what they would do as a bystander.
(Often, students say they would help, but in reality, very few do.
They are unsure about how to help.)
4.
Have students complete "Courage by Degrees" from Sjostrom and Stein (1996), or use a selfreflection tool that you have created.
5.
Divide students into groups and have them brainstorm ways that bystanders can help.
6.
Pull the group back together and share ideas.
You may wish to fill in ideas not mentioned by students.
7.
Ask students to name one thing they would do the next time they witness bullying.
Follow-up: Conflict resolution lessons in befriending, assertiveness and leadership would be helpful to all children, but especially to those children who will take on this helping role.
Bystanders who take action must be supported by the adults in the school (Cowie, 1998).

Chapter 7: Implementing and Promoting Your Program Now that your new program is going into place, here are some strategies to raise public awareness of your progress.
Public Service Announcements: If a media person has been included on the steering committee, this work may have already begun.
Use radio, television, or newspaper sound bites or public service announcements to detail what is happening this week with your program.
If you do not have a media person directly involved, you may need to designate a member of your committee to fulfill this role.
Speaking Engagements: The first group that you will be presenting to is your school board.
Once you have their go-ahead, you are ready to present to other groups; for example, the Parent Teachers' Organization, the Chamber of Commerce, and/or the many service groups.
The committee should consider where and how will you let the students know about your new program.
Professional Service: Many of the members of your steering committee are members of professional groups.
They may be Boy/Girl/Explorer Scout leaders, members of boards of directors, or leaders in a community service organization.
They not only model the behavior of a steering committee member, they serve as advocates for your program.
Professionalism: As you really begin to implement your comprehensive school guidance and counseling program, you may decide to present your work to your state counseling organization.
The New Hampshire School Counselor Association holds yearly conferences and entertains proposals for program presentations.
This is a great way to describe your progress and to receive feedback and share recommendations from other schools, and at the same time inspire others with your progress!.
Student Activities and Events: You are probably enjoying some of these activities: Career Days, Job Shadowing, Poetry and Poster Contests for School Counselor Month or Career Development Month.
What else are you doing in your school that promotes your emerging program? Meetings with Parents: Many schools have program meet with, for example, eighth grade parents about consider alternative times so that you will meet with things to consider? Child care? The dinner schedule? planning evenings during which the staff members the process of course selections.
As you do this, potentially all of the parents.
What are some other Transportation? Who can help you with this?
A Web Presence: School districts today provide on-line communication within and outside of their schools, using the World-Wide-Web.
Ask your web-master to help you set up a website.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
67
Newsletters and Journals: Not only is your school newsletter looking for items of interest, but the New Hampshire School Counselor Association Newsletter welcomes stories that describe the work that you are accomplishing.
Consider submitting articles of interest to regional and national publications as well.
Professionals appreciate stories by and about other professionals.
Policy Briefs: As your Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Program changes and meets your expectations, consider developing one-page policy briefs that describe these changes and your continuing success.
Advocating for Your Program: Because you have been inclusive of your consumers and providers (your steering committee) during the planning and development phases of your program, you have put into place an advocacy group.
Although you and your staff are constantly promoting that which you are accomplishing, a number of other school and community personnel are advocating for, and with, you.
This is one good reason for keeping everyone involved and informed every step of the way.
At the same time that you are counting upon your steering committee to work with you in advocating for your program, you are also modeling positive behavior in every possible situation.
Teachers know their students well because they see them every day.
Teachers are often in touch with parents/guardians about challenges that are facing the students, and can become your best advocate when suggesting that the student join a small guidance group or participate in a classroom activity that addresses those challenges.
By putting a positive spin on the situation, you may be seen as advocating for the teacher at the same time that you are advocating for the students Communicating With Parents/Guardians: Next to the students, the single most important population with whom you work is the parents or guardians.
Some schools provide a yearly spaghetti dinner or pot-luck supper for families and use this as an opportunity to acquaint parents and guardians with the school counselors and the school guidance and counseling program.
One school district sends a guidance letter home with the quarterly grade report, simply keeping parents or guardians informed about what is going on that pertains to their student.
This letter is mailed with the grade report, and is addressed to the parent or guardian.
Using a Time Line: Once your steering committee has decided upon the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to move from a reactive, service-oriented delivery to a proactive, program oriented delivery, they will need to decide the period of time this project will take.
We suggest that you plan on two to three years for a complete change.
If your plan is in place and well communicated to all involved, it may just move right along.
If there are changes in staff, committee members, or other important entities, you may need to revisit certain parts of your planning.
Figure 7 -1 is a suggested sequence.
You may choose to use this to determine your time frame.

Systematic Training Over Time Periodically, your steering committee will need to take stock of its direction, and perhaps even consider some mid-course corrections.
Throughout the process, you need to consider building in training and development time to accomplish this.
You may find that you will send members of your committee to a state or regional conference to gain some expertise to bring back to your committee.
Other times, you may want to bring in a professional to train the entire committee.
Often, the expertise is readily available to you; it may rest with your state department guidance and counseling office, state counseling association leadership personnel, or with someone who has been through the change process.

Chapter 8: Evaluating Your Program There are many aspects to the evaluation of your Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Program.
These aspects can be divided into several manageable parts, each of which can be developed and implemented as a unit within its own time frame and program area.
Three major areas of evaluation and some of the questions that need to be addressed pertain to staff performance, comprehensive guidance program, and guidance curriculum.
The examples included in this chapter are only examples, meant to be adapted or serve as guides so that each program may develop its own evaluation processes and procedures.
Developing Job Descriptions/Facilitating School Counselor Evaluation Each position within the comprehensive program deserves its own job description, and as the program changes, you will need to rewrite job descriptions to make certain that they fit with new responsibilities.
Many schools use the same tool to evaluate both teachers and the school counseling staff.
Sometimes this is done because of contract issues that are common to all staff, and it is important to collect the relevant information about the current evaluation practices in your school, and follow the correct procedures if you would like to make change.
As an example of an evaluation tool specific to school counselors, we have included, with permission, the School Counselor Appraisal adapted from an instrument developed by Kathryn VanZandt, Director of Guidance Programs, Windham High School, Windham, Maine, (Figure 8-1).
A Word about Supervision The supervision of school counselors is composed of three parts.
First, counselors administrative supervision.
The building principal does administrative supervision.
This supervision looks at school counselors' administrative performance.
For instance, counselors arrive on time to work, they need to return phone calls, they need to turn their reports in on administrative supervision, counselors are supervised like other school employees.
receive type of need to time.
In
The second type of supervision is program supervision.
This type of supervision looks at how well the counselor is implementing the comprehensive program elements.
In larger districts a guidance director does this evaluation; in smaller systems, administrators or lead counselors do this type of evaluation.
The third type of supervision is counseling supervision.
Professional school counselors provide essential services, both direct and indirect, to students.
Among these services, school counselors provide counseling to students.
While school counselors do not provide in-depth therapy to students, they do provide supportive and educational counseling and guidance This is the one area where school counselors need specialized supervision, provided by someone with the knowledge and training of a counselor.
Research suggests that unless counselors receive supervision on their counseling skills, their New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
70
skills stagnate and decline.
Yet few school counselors are provided consistent counseling supervision.
Recent research suggests that, more often than not, school administrators will support the provision of counseling supervision if counselors present a strong case for it.
Counseling supervision can take several forms.
Probably most common is the practice of counselors within the same district meeting regularly to discuss the counseling they provide.
This peer supervision reduces isolation, strengthens skills, and can increase the ethical practice of counseling in schools.
Other times, counselors in a district will receive counseling supervision from school psychologists, community mental health counselors or university counselor educators who contract with the school or district.
Regardless of the form counseling supervision takes, its provision is essential to professional implementation of a comprehensive school counseling program.
Student Outcome Evaluation Measurement of student outcomes reveals the effectiveness of your comprehensive school guidance and counseling program in meeting the assessed needs of the student population.
If desired student outcomes have already been determined through the needs assessment, it will be an easy task to develop outcome statements for this type of evaluation.
Figure 8-2 is a sample student outcome assessment that can serve as a guide.
Administering the outcome evaluation to those students who have been selected to learn the specific skill or knowledge in a pre-test/post-test situation (in September and again in May) will yield data to show the degree to which the students believe they have learned the skill.
This approach provides subjective responses from students about areas in which growth has occurred.
Additional information about individual students can be obtained from parents or teachers, if desired, by using a parallel instrument and asking parents or teachers to rate their students.
After gathering the data, compare the results of the three groups to determine which knowledge or skill areas need more attention.
A relatively quick method for assessing student progress is a rubric, a chart that can show individual or accumulative data.
Figure 8-3 is an example of an assessment rubric for this purpose.
Evaluating the Results of Your Curriculum When a comprehensive school guidance and counseling program curriculum presentation, in either a classroom or a group presentation, is completed by a counselor and/or teacher, a very brief presenter(s) evaluation needs to be administered.
Each student should anonymously complete a form similar to figure 8-4 and drop it in a box or envelope before leaving the session.
Figure 8-5 has been designed to serve as a feed-back instrument for 1) classroom activities presented by a counselor and/or teacher 2) groups (one time only meeting or discussion, or ongoing groups), and 3) special workshops or programs (such as class or individual activity, job-shadowing a person in business or industry, visits to a college, etc.).
Care needs to be taken to actually use the results of these evaluations to further the goals of the program and to enhance the good work already being done.
Reviewing the evaluations provides information about trends.
The emerging information can be useful in determining mid-course corrections as the program is developed.
Furthermore, program evaluation categories and program activity review results can be compared within the same year as well as from one year to another over a period of years.
New Hampshire Implementation Manual for Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling
71
Instruments for Program Review A good program evaluation is a process rather than an event that occurs only once or twice.
The primary purpose of evaluation is the improvement of the school guidance and counseling program.
One way to gather ongoing evaluation and feedback from those who use the school guidance and counseling program is to provide an easy way for them to comment after contact with the program.
This gives a welcoming, open atmosphere to the program, demonstrating in concrete terms that the program is designed to meet the needs of the whole school community for the benefit of students.
Figures 8-6 and 8-7 represent sample forms that have been developed to further this process of on-going evaluation and feedback.
The Individual Session Form (Figure 8-6) provides process information for those who would like a method for collecting information about the results from the student's, parent's, or staff person's viewpoint on individual planning sessions or consultation sessions.
This form is intended primarily to give feedback to the individual school counselor on the effectiveness of individual meetings either with students or in the role of consultant with adults.
Some school counseling offices leave these feedback forms outside each office where they are easily noticeable and accessible, along with a closed container where they can be discretely deposited after being filled out.
Not only does this afford continuous feedback, but gives the strong message that feedback is welcomed and responded to by the entire school guidance and counseling program.
It is also important to evaluate your program as a whole.
After carefully building the structure of your comprehensive program and developing the schedule, scope, and sequence of activities that will fulfill the mission of your program, it makes sense to periodically find out how its working.
Periodic evaluation of the program itself allows for data-driven decision making and gives everyone in your school community the opportunity to share feedback about the needs and benefits of the school guidance and counseling program.
Information gleaned from program evaluation can be used by administrators to request budget support to implement the program, and allows for clear communication about all that is accomplished through your efforts.
An example of a Comprehensive School Guidance and Counseling Program Evaluation that may be adapted to fit your program and school is included in figure 8-7.
The program evaluation form may be completed by staff members, either individually or as a group.
By totaling each category and converting to percentages, you will arrive at a quick indication of which categories require additional review and development or reinforcement.
Each school is encouraged to set a level of acceptable performance as indicated by a specific percentage for each of the seven major categories identified on the program evaluation form.
For program planning purposes, each school should establish its own ranking order of the seven categories, according to local philosophy and conditions.
This ranking will help to determine the best use of limited resources.
Comparing the evaluation forms completed by teachers with those completed by counseling staff and administrators can provide rich discussion about future program/staff development and refinement.
