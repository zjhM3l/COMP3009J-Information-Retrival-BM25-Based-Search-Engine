MARIANNE FLECKNER
am delighted to announce that 2001 was a very productive year for the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women.
Our support for the proposed legislation that allows domestic violence victims to collect unemployment insurance was successful and the legislation was passed into law.
The Commission's public hearings continued; the most recent hearings were held in Worcester and Brockton.
Many women and girls testified regarding issues that consume their daily lives.
These issues include, but are not limited to, domestic violence, affordable high quality childcare, affordable housing, access to health care and economic stability or equal pay for equal work.
On behalf of the full Commission, I would like to thank our former Chair, Susana Segat, for all her hard work and dedication over the past two years.
I would also like to extend our wholehearted thanks and best wishes to former Commissioners Mary Ann Glendon, Gwendolyn Tyre and Sandra Jesse who recently stepped down.
We would like to welcome our newest Commissioners, Jennifer Braceras, a John M. Olin Fellow in Law at Harvard Law School, Dianne Luby, President and CEO, Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts and Nilka I.

n our third year of operation, we at the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women are pleased to have come so far in such a short time.
Our priorities continue to be childcare issues and the prevention of violence against women and girls.
Focusing on workforce issues in the childcare communities we plan to support the public and private endeavors to strengthen the quality and continuity of childcare staff.
Continuing to explore innovative methods of violence prevention, we are working closely with the many committed individuals and agencies on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault.
In the fall of 2001 we welcomed Sonia Shah as our Administrative Assistant and Paula Daddona as Program Coordinator.
Both women bring a commitment to improving the status of women and girls.
Paula Daddona is currently the Chair of the Brockton Mayor's Commission on Women's Issues, where she has volunteered since 1999.
While at the University of Michigan, Sonia Shah volunteered and worked at the campus Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center.
This season we also have two extraordinary interns, Valerie Taing, from Simmons College and Alison Mitchell, from Northeastern University Law School, to round out a very productive Commission staff.

LEGISLATIVE UPDATES Legislation Endorsed by the Commission Succeeds in Becoming Law One piece of legislation endorsed by the Commission has become law! An Act to Ensure Eligibility for Unemployment Insurance for Victims of Domestic Violence was signed into law by Acting Governor Swift on August 11, 2001.
This law will help ease the devastating financial impact of domestic violence and assist those affected by domestic violence on the road to economic security.
The Commission is currently supporting two other pieces of legislation: An Act to Prohibit Discrimination in Insurance Policies, which provides for gender-neutral insurance policies, and An Act to Establish a Self-Sufficiency Standard in Massachusetts, which creates a standard that calculates the realistic costs of housing, food, childcare, transportation, medical care and taxes by region within Massachusetts.
At press time, both bills were in House committees.
The Commission is also working to create legislation that establishes a Berkshire Women's Commission.
Currently, the Legislative Subcommittee is tracking more than thirty bills before the legislature that concern the Commission's priorities of Childcare and Violence Against Women.

EEA is a project of Strategies for Children, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing universal, quality early childhood education to 3, 4 and 5-year old children in Massachusetts.

March is National Women's History Month National Women's History Month began in 1978 as effort to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of women in American history.
The Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (California) Commission on the Status of Women initiated a "Women's History Week."
Then in 1987, at the request of educators, museums, and libraries across the country, the National Women's History Project petitioned Congress to expand the celebration to the entire month of March.
A National Women's History Month Congressional Resolution was quickly passed with strong bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.
The theme for National Women's History Month 2002 is Women Sustaining the American Spirit.
The goal is to showcase the diverse and interlocking stories of women who have created and affirmed the American spirit.
The 2002 theme will help deliver the message of who American women are and what they have accomplished.
To celebrate Women's History Month, the Massachusetts Commission on the Status of Women is co-sponsoring several events in March.

Commonwealth Announces Support of New YWCA Battered Women's Shelter
S
tate Senate Majority Leader Linda J. Melconian recently announced, on behalf of Governor Jane Swift and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, that $2.5 million has been committed from the Housing Innovations Fund of the Department of Housing and Community Development to support the YWCA of Western Massachusetts' capital project to build a brand new 48-bed, state-of-the-art battered women's shelter.
The total cost of the new shelter and program services center is estimated to be $7.7 million.
The YWCA has already raised more than $4.5 million in public and private funds in support of the projects.
For additional information, please contact the YWCA's Executive Director, Mary Reardon Johnson at 413-732-3121.
The new shelter will triple the YWCA's current shelter capacity, allowing a substantial increase in the number of women and children served in the shelter, as well as allow for innovative enhancements to the scope of services provided to both women and children.
The new shelter will include childcare and classroom space specifically for the children in the shelter.
YWCA Executive Director Mary Reardon Johnson accepts a check from the Commonwealth of MA. Pictured L to R: Mayor Michael Albano, Senator Linda J. Melconian, YWCA, Executive Director Mary Reardon Johnson, Mary Jenewin-Caplin from Governor Swift's office, and Representative Stephen Buoniconti.
