THE VIRGINIA REGISTER INFORMATION PAGE THE VIRGINIA REGISTER is an official state publication issued every other week throughout the year.
Indexes are published quarterly, and the last index of the year is cumulative.
THE VIRGINIA REGISTER has several functions.
The new and amended sections of regulations, both as proposed and as finally adopted, are required by law to be published in THE VIRGINIA REGISTER OF REGULATIONS.
In addition, THE VIRGINIA REGISTER is a source of other information about state government, including all emergency regulations and executive orders issued by the Governor, the Virginia Tax Bulletin issued periodically by the Department of Taxation, and notices of public hearings and open meetings of state agencies.
extension period; (ii) the Governor exercises his authority to require the agency to provide for additional public comment, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the period for which the Governor has provided for additional public comment; (iii) the Governor and the General Assembly exercise their authority to suspend the effective date of a regulation until the end of the next regular legislative session; or (iv) the agency suspends the regulatory process, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the 30-day public comment period.
Proposed regulatory action may be withdrawn by the promulgating agency at any time before the regulation becomes final.
ADOPTION, AMENDMENT, AND REPEAL OF REGULATIONS An agency wishing to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations must first publish in the Virginia Register a notice of intended regulatory action; a basis, purpose, substance and issues statement; an economic impact analysis prepared by the Department of Planning and Budget; the agency's response to the economic impact analysis; a summary; a notice giving the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal; and the text of the proposed regulation.
Following publication of the proposal in the Virginia Register, the promulgating agency receives public comments for a minimum of 60 days.
The Governor reviews the proposed regulation to determine if it is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and if it is clearly written and easily understandable.
If the Governor chooses to comment on the proposed regulation, his comments must be transmitted to the agency and the Registrar no later than 15 days following the completion of the 60-day public comment period.
The Governor's comments, if any, will be published in the Virginia Register.
Not less than 15 days following the completion of the 60day public comment period, the agency may adopt the proposed regulation.
The appropriate standing committee of each branch of the General Assembly may meet during the promulgation or final adoption process and file an objection with the Registrar and the promulgating agency.
The objection will be published in the Virginia Register.
Within 21 days after receipt by the agency of a legislative objection, the agency shall file a response with the Registrar, the objecting legislative committee, and the Governor.
When final action is taken, the agency again publishes the the regulation as adopted, highlighting all changes made proposed regulation and explaining any substantial changes since publication of the proposal.
A 30-day final adoption begins upon final publication in the Virginia Register.
text of to the made period EMERGENCY REGULATIONS If an agency demonstrates that (i) there is an immediate threat to the public's health or safety; or (ii) Virginia statutory law, the appropriation act, federal law, or federal regulation requires a regulation to take effect no later than (a) 280 days from the enactment in the case of Virginia or federal law or the appropriation act, or (b) 280 days from the effective date of a federal regulation, it then requests the Governor's approval to adopt an emergency regulation.
The emergency regulation becomes operative upon its adoption and filing with the Registrar of Regulations, unless a later date is specified.
Emergency regulations are limited to addressing specifically defined situations and may not exceed 12 months in duration.
Emergency regulations are published as soon as possible in the Register.
During the time the emergency status is in effect, the agency may proceed with the adoption of permanent regulations through the usual procedures.
To begin promulgating the replacement regulation, the agency must (i) file the Notice of Intended Regulatory Action with the Registrar within 60 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation; and (ii) file the proposed regulation with the Registrar within 180 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation.
If the agency chooses not to adopt the regulations, the emergency status ends when the prescribed time limit expires.
STATEMENT The foregoing constitutes a generalized statement of the procedures to be followed.
For specific statutory language, it is suggested that Article 2 (Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9-6.14:7.1 et seq.) of Chapter 1.1:1 of the Code of Virginia be examined carefully.

Virginia Water Protection Permit Regulation.
The purpose of the proposed action is to amend the regulation to incorporate changes to Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.3, 62.1-44.5, 62.1-44.15, 62.1-44.15:5 and 62.1-44.29 of the Code of Virginia relating to wetlands as mandated by the 2000 General Assembly in Senate Bill 648 and House Bill 1170 and other changes that the department or the public deems necessary and are warranted.
These changes are designed to clarify and streamline the permitting process and to establish and implement policies and programs to protect and enhance the Commonwealth's wetland resources, using a regulatory approach to achieve no net loss of wetlands and a voluntary approach to achieve a net resource gain.

General Virginia Water Permit for Wetland Restoration and Creation Activities.
The purpose of the proposed action is to develop general permits for activities in wetlands as specified in changes to Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15:5 of the Code of Virginia relating to wetlands as mandated by the General Assembly in Senate Bill 648 and House Bill 1170.
The new regulations are needed to expedite and streamline the wetland permitting process in Virginia.
Need: Pursuant to the actions of the 2000 General Assembly, Virginia Water Protection Permit General Permits are to be developed in accordance with changes to Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15:5 of the Code of Virginia relating to wetlands.
General permits are to be developed for such activities in wetlands as the board deems appropriate, and are to include such terms and conditions as the board deems necessary to protect state Monday, July 3, 2000 Notices of Intended Regulatory Action resources and fish and wildlife resources from significant impairment.
The adoption of general permits for wetland impacts is essential to protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens because they will streamline the permitting process, allowing agencies and applicants to save time and money.
Substance: The proposed regulatory action is to develop a series of Virginia Water Protection Permit General Permits in response to the requirements of new legislation.
These general permits are for classes of similar activities with minimal environmental consequence.
The board shall develop general permits for: 1.
Activities causing wetland impacts of less than onehalf of an acre; 2.
Facilities and activities of utilities and public service companies regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or State Corporation Commission; 3.
Coal, natural gas, and coal bed methane gas mining activities authorized by the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, and for sand mining activities; 4.
Virginia Department of Transportation or other linear transportation projects; and 5.
Activities governed by nationwide or regional permits approved by the board and issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Conditions contained in the general permits shall include, but not be limited to, filing with the board copies of any preconstruction notification, postconstruction report and certificate of compliance required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The permits will contain specific thresholds for use and mitigation ratios for compensation for unavoidable wetland impacts.
Alternatives: The alternative of not developing these general permits is not feasible as the proposed changes are mandated by action of the General Assembly.
The alternative of developing these permits will clarify and streamline the permitting process and help alleviate duplicative requirements of state and federal programs.
Public Participation: The board is seeking comments on the intended regulatory action, including ideas to assist in the development of general permits.
An informational public meeting will be held and notice of the meeting posted in the Calendar of Events section of the Virginia Register of Regulations.
In addition, a Technical Advisory Committee has been formed to assist in the development of the general permits; notice of the meeting dates will be posted in the Calendar of Events section of the Virginia Register of Regulations.
The board is using the participatory approach in the development of these regulations.

No. R00-211; Filed June 15, 2000, 12:01 p.m.
(See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: Section 58.1-439.9 of the Code of Virginia mandates the board to promulgate regulations for (i) establishing procedures for claiming the tax credit and (ii) providing for the allocation of tax credits among taxpayers requesting credits and employers claiming grants under the Virginia Targeted Tax Grant Program.
The Virginia Employer Tax Credit is currently operating under the provisions of an emergency regulation.
Purpose: The purpose of the regulation is to set forth procedures for employers to claim tax credits when they hire qualified TANF recipients.
The purpose of the tax credit is to provide incentives to employers to hire TANF recipients who otherwise may not be considered for a position, thereby, maximizing employment opportunities that will lead to selfsufficiency.
Substance: The regulation will set forth time frames for the submission of applications for the Virginia Employer Tax Credit (VETC) and the Virginia Targeted Job Grant (VTJG).
Additionally, requirements for submission of applications for the respective programs as well as details on how funds will be allocated for the programs will be addressed.
As set forth in the enacting legislation, the regulation must address the allocation of the funding between the VTJG and the VETC.
The funding issue was created by the enacting legislation which tied funding for both programs to the appropriation for the VTJG.
The regulation must describe how the appropriation will be allocated between the two programs.
Issues: The primary advantage of implementing this regulation is the provision of a tax credit that will provide employers with incentives to hire recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
This regulation will benefit both the employer and the recipient.
The advantages of this regulation to the public and the agency will be a reduction in the TANF caseload.
Because of the block grant and maintenance of effort spending requirements, there will not be a direct impact on public assistance spending; however, the Commonwealth's TANF surplus may be indirectly impacted.
Further, the public will benefit by the fact the former recipients will be productive, taxpaying citizens.
The disadvantage to the agency is additional costs associated with administering the program.
Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 13 (94).
Section 9-6.14:7.1 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property.
The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts.

Volume 16, Issue 21 Monday, July 3, 2000 2615 Proposed Regulations Summary of the proposed regulation.
This amendment to the Virginia Independence Program (VIP) permanently implements the Virginia Employer Tax Credit, which was originally implemented through an emergency regulation on May 19, 1999.
The Virginia Employer Tax Credit offers a tax credit not to exceed $750 to employers who hire qualified Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients.
The Employer Tax Credit program, along with the Virginia Targeted Jobs Grant (VTJG), has been appropriated $375,000 each year through fiscal year 2000 for its implementation.
Money not spent for tax credits or job grants reverts back to the general VIEW fund for use in other programs.
Estimated economic impact.
Current Literature The majority of recent literature on welfare-to-work strategies concentrates on overall initiatives rather than specific components, such as tax credit or job grant programs.
One recent study of four state welfare-to-work strategies showed clear positive results in terms of employment and earnings gains for program participants.1 In addition, the resulting reductions in public assistance payments were large enough to offset program costs in two of the four programs, and in a third when impacts on other transfer payments (i.e., Medicaid payments, food stamps) were factored in.
The programs that included more generous education and training components were more likely to have longer lasting impacts on recipient's self-sufficiency and income, although these programs generally cost more and, therefore, do not provide the same amount of short-run savings to government.
Recent literature on tax credits and wage subsidies presents evidence that such policies often have low utilization rates.2 Data from the 1970s Work Incentive Tax Credit (WINTC) program indicates that no more than 20% of the workincentive program enrollees who were known to have entered employment during the year were claimed by firms as a tax credit.3 During the Job Opportunities in the Business Sector (JOBS) program in the late 1960s-early 1970s, the federal government offered contracts that would reimburse businesses an average of $3,200 per placement.
Despite this relatively large hiring subsidy and much publicity, only one third of all businesses hiring JOBS eligible employees took advantage of the grant.
Review of Employer Tax Credit Program to Date Implemented on May 19, 1999, as an emergency regulation, the Employer Tax Credit program has been in place for almost seven months [this analysis is dated December 21, 1999].
Although some businesses have expressed interest, no one has been placed through the Employer Tax Credit program to date.4 One possible reason why the Employer Tax Credit program is not currently being utilized may be that availability of a tax credit has not been aggressively marketed.
Another possible explanation could be that the tax credit is not large enough to generate firm interest.
Although the Employer Tax Credit program is not currently being used, it is still possible to evaluate its potential cost effectiveness.
In spite of minimal administrative costs, the average cost per new job created may be greater than the tax credit amount of $750.
There are two reasons for this.
First, certain participants hired might have found jobs without the Employer Tax Credit program and, therefore, do not represent a net increase in employment.
This is especially relevant since the tax credit program is open to all TANF recipients and a significant portion of that population has historically been able to return to the workforce without state assistance.
The second reason the average cost per new job created may exceed the tax credit amount of $750 is that the program provides a subsidy for qualifying welfare recipients.
The effect of such a subsidy will be to increase the demand for tax credit-eligible workers relative to other comparably skilled workers since the cost of hiring them is lower.
If a tax crediteligible individual is hired in place of a noneligible worker then there is (again) no net gain in employment.
The extent of such job displacement among nonqualifying workers will depend on the state of the labor market.
In a tight labor market where jobs are plentiful and workers are scarce, a wage subsidy is more likely to create new jobs, although the possibility that the participants hired would have found work without the grant is higher.
In a slack labor market where jobs are few and workers are plentiful, a wage subsidy will most likely result in substantial job displacement for nonqualifying workers as firms turn to "cheaper" labor.
The most obvious benefits of successful placements resulting from the tax credits will be the savings in Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF) assistance and other related transfer payments.
These savings will result from the increased incomes of participants and their earlier departure from the welfare rolls.
Some individuals may also gain employment that provides health insurance benefits, decreasing state Medicaid expenditures.
The community will benefit from the increase in productivity that results from the movement of individuals from the welfare rolls to the workforce.
On the other hand, there are some potential costs associated with an individual's transition to the workforce.
While the belief that most people prefer to be productive members of society is probably well-grounded, a single mother that must work long hours at a low-paying job while having to put her children in day care may believe that she was better off on welfare, especially if the available day care is perceived to be of a lower quality.
A precise estimate of the cost effectiveness of this program would require the following information: 1 Friedlander, Daniel and Gary Burtless.

How many individuals hired with the tax credit subsequently returned to the welfare system? 5.
What is the increased productivity to society of the employed worker (i.e., the value gained by society)? Because there is little data on any of these important factors, it is not possible to draw a conclusion about whether the benefits resulting from the tax credit program will outweigh the costs.
Businesses and entities affected.
The Virginia Employer Tax Credit (VTEC) offers a tax credit not to exceed $750 to employers who hire qualified Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients.
In FY 1999, there was an average of 37,798 TANF recipients per month.
This regulation will also positively affect businesses that take advantage of the wage subsidy.
A firm will not hire additional workers unless there is some marginal benefit, however small it may be.
This benefit to the firm may come in the form of higher profits or it may be derived from the contribution to the community or an enhanced reputation, but, in any case, the firm will expect to be better off.
Localities particularly affected.
This regulation is not expected to disproportionately affect any particular localities.
Projected impact on employment.
This program could potentially result in a net increase in employment for Virginia.
As discussed previously, the extent of the increase would depend on the state of the labor market and whether the placements would have found jobs otherwise.
In a slack labor market the potential for job displacements of noneligible workers is strong.
Effects on the use and value of private property.
This regulation is not expected to have any effect on the use and value of private property.
Agency's Response to the Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Social Services concurs with the findings of the Department of Planning and Budget.
Summary: The regulation sets forth procedures for employers to claim tax credits when they hire Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients as authorized by the passage of HB 696 during the 1998 session of the Virginia General Assembly.
The tax credit provides incentives to employers to hire TANF recipients who otherwise may not be considered for an employment opportunity.

The owner of any community and nontransient noncommunity waterworks may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirement of subdivisions B 2 c and d (2) of this section.
The waterworks owner shall reapply for a waiver for each compliance period.
f.
A commissioner may grant a waiver after evaluating the following factors: Knowledge of previous use (including transport, storage, or disposal) of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence of the source.
If a determination by the commissioner reveals no previous use of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence, a waiver may be granted.
If previous use of the contaminant is unknown or it has been used previously, then the following factors shall be used to determine whether a waiver is granted.
(1) Previous analytical results.
(2) The proximity of the waterworks to a potential point or nonpoint source of contamination.
Point sources include spills and leaks of chemicals at or near a waterworks or at manufacturing, distribution, or storage facilities, or from hazardous and municipal waste landfills and other waste handling or treatment facilities.
Nonpoint sources for SOCs include the use of pesticides to control insect and weed pests on agricultural areas, forest lands, home and gardens, and other land application uses.
(3) The environmental persistence and transport of the contaminants listed in Table 2.3 VOC and SOC. (4) How well the water source is protected against contamination, such as whether it is a waterworks which uses a surface water source in whole or in part or whether it is a groundwater source waterworks.
Groundwater source waterworks shall consider factors such as depth of the well, the type of soil, wellhead protection, and well structure integrity.
Waterworks which use surface water in whole or in part shall consider watershed protection.
(5) Special factors.
(a) For VOCs.
The number of persons served by the waterworks and the proximity of a smaller waterworks to a larger waterworks.
(b) For SOCs.
Elevated nitrate levels at the waterworks supply source.
(c) For SOCs.
Use of PCBs in equipment used in the production, storage, or distribution of water (i.e., PCBs used in pumps, transformers, etc.). g. Condition for waivers.
(1) As a condition of the VOC waiver the owner of a groundwater waterworks shall take one sample at each sampling point during the time the waiver is effective (i.e., one sample during two compliance Virginia Register of Regulations 2652 Final Regulations periods or six years) and update its vulnerability assessment considering the factors listed in subdivision B 2 f of this section.
Based on this vulnerability assessment the commissioner shall reconfirm that the waterworks owner is nonvulnerable.
If the commissioner does not make this reconfirmation within three years of the initial determination, then the waiver is invalidated and the waterworks is required to sample annually as specified in subdivision B 2 d (1)(a) of this sectio

f.
A commissioner may grant a waiver after evaluating the following factors: Knowledge of previous use (including transport, storage, or disposal) of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence of the source.
If a determination by the commissioner reveals no previous use of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence, a waiver may be granted.
If previous use of the contaminant is unknown or it has been used previously, then the following factors shall be used to determine whether a waiver is granted.
(1) Previous analytical results.
(2) The proximity of the waterworks to a potential point or nonpoint source of contamination.
Point sources include spills and leaks of chemicals at or near a waterworks or at manufacturing, distribution, or storage facilities, or from hazardous and municipal waste landfills and other waste handling or treatment facilities.

(3) The environmental persistence and transport of the contaminants listed in Table 2.3 VOC and SOC. (4) How well the water source is protected against contamination, such as whether it is a waterworks which uses a surface water source in whole or in part or whether it is a groundwater source waterworks.
Groundwater source waterworks shall consider factors such as depth of the well, the type of soil, wellhead protection, and well structure integrity.
Waterworks which use surface water in whole or in part shall consider watershed protection.
(5) Special factors.
(a) For VOCs.

(b) For SOCs.
Elevated nitrate levels at the waterworks supply source.
(c) For SOCs.
Use of PCBs in equipment used in the production, storage, or distribution of water (i.e., PCBs used in pumps, transformers, etc.). g. Condition for waivers.
(1) As a condition of the VOC waiver the owner of a groundwater waterworks shall take one sample at each sampling point during the time the waiver is effective (i.e., one sample during two compliance Virginia Register of Regulations 2652 Final Regulations periods or six years) and update its vulnerability assessment considering the factors listed in subdivision B 2 f of this section.
Based on this vulnerability assessment the commissioner shall reconfirm that the waterworks owner is nonvulnerable.
If the commissioner does not make this reconfirmation within three years of the initial determination, then the waiver is invalidated and the waterworks is required to sample annually as specified in subdivision B 2 d (1)(a) of this sectio
