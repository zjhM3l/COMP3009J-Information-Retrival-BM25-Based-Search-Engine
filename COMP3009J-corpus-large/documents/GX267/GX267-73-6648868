THE VIRGINIA REGISTER INFORMATION PAGE THE VIRGINIA REGISTER is an official state publication issued every other week throughout the year.
Indexes are published quarterly, and the last index of the year is cumulative.
THE VIRGINIA REGISTER has several functions.
The new and amended sections of regulations, both as proposed and as finally adopted, are required by law to be published in THE VIRGINIA REGISTER OF REGULATIONS.
In addition, THE VIRGINIA REGISTER is a source of other information about state government, including all emergency regulations and executive orders issued by the Governor, the Virginia Tax Bulletin issued periodically by the Department of Taxation, and notices of public hearings and open meetings of state agencies.
the agency to provide for additional public comment, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the period for which the Governor has provided for additional public comment; (iii) the Governor and the General Assembly exercise their authority to suspend the effective date of a regulation until the end of the next regular legislative session; or (iv) the agency suspends the regulatory process, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn, becomes effective on the date specified, which shall be after the expiration of the 30-day public comment period.
Proposed regulatory action may be withdrawn by the promulgating agency at any time before the regulation becomes final.
ADOPTION, AMENDMENT, AND REPEAL OF REGULATIONS An agency wishing to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations must first publish in the Virginia Register a notice of intended regulatory action; a basis, purpose, substance and issues statement; an economic impact analysis prepared by the Department of Planning and Budget; the agency's response to the economic impact analysis; a summary; a notice giving the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal; and the text of the proposed regulation.
Following publication of the proposal in the Virginia Register, the promulgating agency receives public comments for a minimum of 60 days.
The Governor reviews the proposed regulation to determine if it is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and if it is clearly written and easily understandable.
If the Governor chooses to comment on the proposed regulation, his comments must be transmitted to the agency and the Registrar no later than 15 days following the completion of the 60-day public comment period.
The Governor's comments, if any, will be published in the Virginia Register.
Not less than 15 days following the completion of the 60day public comment period, the agency may adopt the proposed regulation.
The appropriate standing committee of each branch of the General Assembly may meet during the promulgation or final adoption process and file an objection with the Registrar and the promulgating agency.
The objection will be published in the Virginia Register.
Within 21 days after receipt by the agency of a legislative objection, the agency shall file a response with the Registrar, the objecting legislative committee, and the Governor.
When final action is taken, the agency again publishes the the regulation as adopted, highlighting all changes made proposed regulation and explaining any substantial changes since publication of the proposal.
A 30-day final adoption begins upon final publication in the Virginia Register.
text of to the made period EMERGENCY REGULATIONS If an agency demonstrates that (i) there is an immediate threat to the public's health or safety; or (ii) Virginia statutory law, the appropriation act, federal law, or federal regulation requires a regulation to take effect no later than (a) 280 days from the enactment in the case of Virginia or federal law or the appropriation act, or (b) 280 days from the effective date of a federal regulation, it then requests the Governor's approval to adopt an emergency regulation.
The emergency regulation becomes operative upon its adoption and filing with the Registrar of Regulations, unless a later date is specified.
Emergency regulations are limited to addressing specifically defined situations and may not exceed 12 months in duration.
Emergency regulations are published as soon as possible in the Register.
During the time the emergency status is in effect, the agency may proceed with the adoption of permanent regulations through the usual procedures.
To begin promulgating the replacement regulation, the agency must (i) file the Notice of Intended Regulatory Action with the Registrar within 60 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation; and (ii) file the proposed regulation with the Registrar within 180 days of the effective date of the emergency regulation.
If the agency chooses not to adopt the regulations, the emergency status ends when the prescribed time limit expires.
STATEMENT The foregoing constitutes a generalized statement of the procedures to be followed.
For specific statutory language, it is suggested that Article 2 (Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9-6.14:7.1 et seq.) of Chapter 1.1:1 of the Code of Virginia be examined carefully.

PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODS - PROPOSED REGULATIONS TITLE 9.
ENVIRONMENT STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD October 27, 1999 7 p.m.
Public Hearing Shenandoah County Brick Building, 112 South Main Street, 3rd Floor Conference Room, Woodstock, Virginia.
November 29, 1999 - Public comments may be submitted until this date.
Notice is hereby given in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9-6.14:7.1 of the Code of Virginia that the State Water Control Board intends to amend regulations entitled: 9 VAC 25-260-5 et seq.
Water Quality Standards.
Water Quality Standards consist of designated uses of the water body and narrative and numeric criteria that protect those uses by describing water quality in general terms and specifically as numerical limits for physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water.
The State Water Control Board proposes to amend the State Water Control Board's Water Quality Standards at 9 VAC 25-260-350 and 9 VAC 25-260-400 to designate Stony Creek and its tributaries in Shenandoah County as a nutrient enriched water.
If the water is designated nutrient enriched, a companion regulation, the Board's Policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters, 9 VAC 25-40-10 et seq., requires certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentration of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less.
Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a design flow of 1.3 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus.
Question and Answer Period: A question and answer period will be held one-half hour prior to the beginning of the public hearing at the same location.
Department of Environmental Quality staff will be present to answer questions regarding the proposed action.
Accessibility to Person with Disabilities: The hearing will be held at a public facility believed to be accessible to persons with disabilities.
Any persons with questions on the accessibility of the facilities should contact Jean Gregory at Volume 16, Issue 1 15 the address or phone numbers in the contact information given below.
Comments: The agency requests comments on any aspect of the proposal and also on the costs and benefits of the proposal.
Alternatives: In compliance with the State Water Control Board's Public Participation Guidelines, 9 VAC 25-10-10 et seq., the department will consider all alternatives which are considered to be less burdensome and less intrusive for achieving the essential purpose of the proposed regulation and any other alternatives presented during the proposed rulemaking.
Several alternatives have already been considered.
One alternative was to leave the regulation unchanged.
This may appear to be the least intrusive approach; however, such an alternative would not provide a control strategy for the potential water quality degradation in Stony Creek from an already documented excess of phosphorus.
There may be other less intrusive alternatives to consider.
For example, other alternatives would be to designate only the mainstem or a portion of the mainstem of Stony Creek as a nutrient enriched water.
Other Pertinent Information: The department has conducted analyses on the proposed action related to basis, substance, issues, need, estimated impacts, applicable federal requirements and alternative approaches and schedule for reevaluation.
These analyses as well as copies of the amendments may be viewed at the Department of Environmental Quality, Valley Regional Office, 4411 Early Road, Harrisonburg, VA 22801 or obtained from Jean Gregory.

PROPOSED REGULATIONS TITLE 9.
ENVIRONMENT STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD Title of Regulation: 9 VAC 25-260-5 et seq.
Water Quality Standards (amending 9 VAC 25-260-350 and 9 VAC 25260-400).
Statutory Authority: Ã¯Â¿Â½ 62.1-44.15(3a) of the Code of Virginia.
Public Hearing Date: October 27, 1999 - 7 p.m.
Public comments may be submitted until November 29, 1999.
(See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: Section 62.1-44.15(3a) of the Code of Virginia authorizes the State Water Control Board to establish water quality standards and policies for any state waters consistent with the purpose and general policy of the State Water Control Law, and to modify, amend or cancel any such standards or policies established.
Such standards shall be adopted only after a hearing is held and the board takes into consideration the economic and social costs and benefits which can reasonably be expected to be obtained as a result of the standards as adopted, modified or canceled.
Purpose: Amendments to the Water Quality Standards (9 VAC 25-260-350 and 9 VAC 25-260-400 section 6) are proposed to designate Stony Creek and its tributaries as nutrient enriched waters in order to hold the line on nutrient enrichment in these waters via the point source total phosphorus control requirements in the board's Policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters (9 VAC 25-40-10 et seq.).
The proposed regulation is essential in protecting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth.
It will enhance the department's ability to protect the water quality and living resources of Stony Creek for consumption of fish, recreation uses and conservation in general.
Although nutrients such as phosphorus are necessary for the growth of algae which are an essential part of the food chain, problems occur when an overabundance of these nutrients cause excessive growths of algae.
Excessive amounts of aquatic plants, particularly algae, can discolor the water, create taste and odor problems for water supply managers, reduce water clarity and block sunlight from submerged aquatic vegetation.
Another side effect of excessive algal blooms is impairment of primary contact recreation due to the aesthetically displeasing appearance of the water.
The most serious problem resulting from algal growth occurs when the plants die and decay; at that time they can deplete the oxygen level of the water to the point where fish and other aquatic organisms cannot survive.
It is important, therefore, that there are nutrient controls so that the symptoms of nutrient enrichment, i.e., the excessive growth of plants and fluctuating levels of dissolved oxygen, be avoided.
The proposed regulation is also essential for the efficient and economical performance of an important governmental function.
The amendment will establish the appropriate standards for use in calculating permit limits for point source discharges under the Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System Permit program.
Substance: The department's evaluation of agency in-stream nutrient monitoring data for Stony Creek for the period of July 6, 1994, through May 6, 1997, indicates nutrient enriched conditions.
Consequently, the department proposes that the watershed (Stony Creek and its tributaries) qualifies for regulatory designation as a nutrient enriched water.
The basis for this determination was monitoring data for total phosphorus, which is one of three indicators of nutrient enrichment used for regulatory designation of waters as nutrient enriched.
If the water is designated nutrient enriched a companion regulation, the board's policy for Nutrient Enriched waters (9 VAC 25-40-10), requires certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentrations of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less.
Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a design flow of 1.3 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus.
Issues: Total phosphorus is one of three indicators of nutrient enrichment used for regulatory designation of waters as nutrient enriched.
The department's monitoring data indicate that total phosphorus levels in this creek are above the nutrient enrichment trigger for this parameter.
Several citizens at the public meeting were concerned that we were not basing the designation on nitrogen levels in the creek, but the technical advisory committee report which we use to evaluate whether a waterbody is nutrient enriched does not consider nitrogen to be an appropriate indicator of nutrient enrichment in flowing waters.
Several citizens have inquired whether designation of Stony Creek as a nutrient enriched water will automatically place it on the 303(d) list.
303(d) refers to a section of the federal Clean Water Act that, in conjunction with a 1992 federal regulation, requires the states to notify the public and submit a list to the Environmental Protection Agency of those waters which are not meeting water quality standards or are indicating declining quality and potential problems.
There are five parts to the list and Total Maximum Daily Loads (which are usually called TMDLs) are to be developed for waters placed on parts 1 and 2 which are those waters identified through monitoring or modeling to not meet water quality standards.
Waters designated as nutrient enriched in the standards regulation are both identified in the 305(b) report Virginia Register of Regulations 18 Proposed Regulations and listed in part IV of the 303(d) list as "fully supported but threatened" for nutrients.
A threatened listing does not result in the development of TMDLs, which is Total Maximum Daily Loads, but its listing does draw careful attention to the waterbody and biological and chemical monitoring will continue in these waters to determine the impact.
The above may be perceived as disadvantages to the public.
There are no disadvantages to the department for the implementation or enforcement of the proposed amendment.
Impact: If these waters are designated as nutrient enriched, a companion regulation, the board's Policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters (9 VAC 25-40-10 et seq.), would require certain point source dischargers to these waters with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentration of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less.
Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a flow of 1.3 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus.
The other three point source dischargers in the watershed, Stony Creek Sanitary District, Shrine Mont, and Edinburg Sewage Treatment Plant, have design flows below that covered in the Policy and thus would not be required to install phosphorus controls.
New dischargers with flows greater than or equal to 50,000 gallons per day who propose to discharge to these nutrient enriched waters would be required to meet the monthly average total phosphorus effluent limitation of 2 mg/l.
Because the amendment is specific to that area and not statewide in nature, Shenandoah County could be considered "particularly affected."
Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98).
Section 9-6.14:7.1 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property.
The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts.
Summary of the proposed regulation.
The proposed regulation amends the Commonwealth's Water Quality Standards Regulation to designate Stony Creek and its tributaries in Shenandoah County as a nutrient enriched water.
When a water body is designated as nutrient enriched, a companion regulation (the board's policy for Nutrient Enriched Waters (9 VAC 25-40-10)) requires that certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater, and whose effluents contain phosphorus, maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentrations of two milligrams per liter or less.
The only point source discharger impacted by this requirement would be Rocco Farm Foods, near Edinburg, which has a design flow of 1.3 MGD.
Estimated economic impact.
As discussed above, a consequence of this regulation is that dischargers into Stony Creek with a design flow of 1.0 MGD must install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorous.
Currently, Rocco Farm Foods would be the only point source discharger that would be subject to this requirement.
There are two sets of economic impacts that may arise because of this requirement.
One result of this requirement could be that Rocco Farm Foods could redesign its flow operations so that the design flow would be less than 1.0 MGD.
Another set of impacts result if Rocco Farm Foods keeps its current design flow and installs a phosphorus removal system.
The requirement to install phosphorus removal systems only applies to sources with design flow greater than 1.0 MGD. Rocco Farm Foods currently has a design flow of 1.3 MGD.
It might be possible for Rocco to redesign its processes to reduce its design flow to below 1.0 MGD.
If Rocco could do this, it would no longer be subject to the requirement to install phosphorus removal systems.
However, while this is theoretically possible, discussions with Tim Moppin, in charge of environmental permitting for Rocco Farm Foods, suggest that it would be very difficult for Rocco to reduce its design flow to under 1.0 MGD, and therefore that it would not be likely that they would do so (Conversation with Moppin, 4-1699).
This implies that Rocco expects that the cost of reducing its design flow to exceed the cost of the installation of the phosphorus removal systems.
Instead of reducing its design flow to under 1.0 MGD, it is likely that, due to the requirements arising because of this regulation, Rocco Farm Foods will install a phosphorus removal system.
We therefore need to examine the costs and benefits arising from this installation.
The costs associated with this installation are somewhat uncertain, because very little phosphorus-specific removal systems have been developed.
Rocco Farm Foods is working with Professor Clifford Randall of Virginia Tech to develop this system.
The exact cost of this system is uncertain, because it is early in its development.
However, one rough estimate is that installation of this system will cost two million dollars, according to Tim Moppin (Conversation with Moppin, 4-1699).
Another rough estimate from John Reid, a consulting engineer located in Fredericksburg, given to Bob Wolfe of Rocco, was two and a half million dollars (Email from Clifford Randall).
Other costs could include the continuing costs of operating this system, and the cost of enforcing the permit.
Rocco does not expect there to be substantial continuing costs of operation (Conversation with Bob Wolfe, Rocco Farms, 4-26-99).
Also, the Department of Environmental quality does not expect that any extra resources will be necessary to enforce this permit (Conversation with Jean Gregory, 4-16-99).
Thus, the costs of this regulation appear to be primarily the costs of installing the phosphorus removal system.
On the other hand, there will be many benefits from this installation, but these benefits are very difficult to quantify.
After installation of the removal system, Rocco Farm Foods expects discharges of phosphorus to be significantly reduced Monday, September 27, 1999 19 Volume 16, Issue 1 Proposed Regulations (Conversation with Moppin, 4-16-99).
This improvement in water quality will have several beneficial effects.
There are many fish and wildlife affected by the water quality of Stony Creek.
The wood turtle, which is listed as threatened by the Commonwealth of Virginia, has been documented near Stony Creek.
Improvements in water quality are expected to be beneficial to this species (Comment by Department of Conservation and Recreation, from Public Comments on this Regulation, 11-20-98).
Also, a trout fishery is located near the discharge point of Rocco Farm Foods.
Reducing the level of phosphorus in Stony Creek will lead to higher levels of dissolved oxygen which will greatly benefit this trout fishery.
There are also aesthetic and recreational benefits from reducing phosphorus discharges.
Stony Creek itself has aesthetically pleasing clear water.
To keep this water clear, reductions in phosphorus levels are necessary to prevent significant increases in algae.
Also, this region offers opportunities for ecotourism.
Maintenance of the water quality of Stony Creek is important to these opportunities.
Additionally, Stony Creek flows into the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, and much rafting activities take place on the Shenandoah River.
These rafting activities also will be benefited by maintenance of the water quality of Stony Creek.
A further advantage arises because the waters from Stony Creek eventually reach the Chesapeake Bay.
Reducing phosphorus discharges into Stony Creek can therefore reduce the amount of phosphorus entering the Bay.
While all of these are advantages to the installation of the phosphorus removal system by Rocco Farm Foods, it is difficult to determine the monetary value of these advantages.
Doing so is beyond the scope of this review.
However, such an investigation would examine the following: the value of improving the likelihood of survival of the wood turtle in this region; the value of improved trout size and yield at the trout fishery; the value placed on the cleanliness of Stony Creek by residents of the Commonwealth; additional profits for rafting and ecotourism operators, arising due to the improvement of the water quality of Stony Creek; and the cost of the next best alternative to reducing the same amount of phosphorus discharges into the Chesapeake Bay.
These are all significant values, but they are also difficult to quantify.
The sum of these values could then be compared to the cost of installing the removal system, along with the costs of operating this system.
Businesses and entities affected.
This regulation will directly affect Rocco Farm Foods.
Businesses indirectly affected include a trout fishery located nearby the Rocco discharge point, and operators of ecotourism and rafting in the area, and along the North Fork of the Shenandoah River.
Localities particularly affected.
The Rocco Farm Foods facility is near the town of Edinburg.
This locality will be principally affected by this regulation.
Projected impact on employment.
The proposed regulation is not expected to have any affect on employment (Conversation with Bob Wolfe, Rocco Farms, 4-26-99).
Effects on the use and value of private property.
This regulation will lead to the installation of a costly phosphorus * removal system.
However, once this is installed, it is not expected to have any substantial negative effect on private property.
Summary of analysis.
The proposed regulation designates Stony Creek and its tributaries in Shenandoah County as nutrient enriched water.
A consequence of this regulation is that municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater must maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentrations of two milligrams per liter or less.
Because of this, Rocco Farm Foods, which has a design flow of 1.3 MGD, must either reduce its design flow below 1.0 MGD or install a phosphorus removal system.
It is expected that Rocco will install a phosphorus removal system.
While it is currently unclear exactly what phosphorus removal system will be installed, it is expected that the cost of whatever system is installed will be approximately two million dollars.
There will be many benefits resulting from the decreased discharges of phosphorus.
These benefits include protection of fish and wildlife nearby, improvement of the aesthetic quality of the river, maintenance of recreational opportunities including rafting, and a reduction of phosphorus discharges into the Chesapeake Bay.
It is difficult to assess a monetary value to any of these benefits, but it is expected that these benefits will be substantial.
Agency's Response to the Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The department has reviewed the economic impact analysis prepared by the Department of Planning and Budget and has no comment.
Summary: The proposed amendments designate Stony Creek and its tributaries in Shenandoah County as a nutrient enriched water.
If the water is designated nutrient enriched a companion regulation, the board's policy for Nutrient Enriched waters (9 VAC 25-40-10), requires certain municipal and industrial dischargers with a design flow of 1.0 MGD or greater and effluents containing phosphorus to maintain a monthly average total phosphorus concentration of 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less.
Rocco Farm Foods near Edinburg - based on a design flow of 1.3 MGD - would be the only point source discharger impacted by this regulatory requirement to install a phosphorus removal system to control total phosphorus.

GAMING VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION REPROPOSED 6f IV PWS pH-6.5-9.5 6g IV pH-6.5-9.5 Title of Regulation: 11 VAC 10-60-10 et seq.
Regulations Pertaining to Horse Racing with Pari-Mutuel Wagering: Participants (amending 11 VAC 10-60-10, 11 VAC 10-6020, 11 VAC 10-60-40, 11 VAC 10-60-70, 11 VAC 10-60-120, 11 VAC 10-60-130, 11 VAC 10-60-140, and 11 VAC 10-60150; adding 11 VAC 10-60-15, 11 VAC 10-60-290, 11 VAC 10-60-300, 11 VAC 10-60-310, and 11 VAC 10-60-320; repealing 11 VAC 10-60-30 and 11 VAC 10-60-60).
Statutory Authority: Ã¯Â¿Â½ 59.1-369 of the Code of Virginia.
Public Hearing Date: N/A -- Public comments may be submitted until November 29, 1999.
(See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: The Virginia Racing Commission derives its statutory authority to promulgate regulations from the provisions of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 59.1-369 of the Code of Virginia.
The section states, in part in subdivision 3, "The Commission shall promulgate regulations and conditions under which horse racing with parimutuel wagering shall be conducted in the Commonwealth, and all such other regulations it deems necessary and appropriate to effect the purposes of the chapter."
The proposed regulation was published in its proposed version in the October 12, 1998, issue of the Register of Regulations.
A public hearing was held on the regulation on November 18, 1998.
After receiving written and oral comment on the proposed action, staff met with interested parties to revise the proposed version.
On advice from counsel from the Attorney General's Office, the commission at its August 18, 1999, meeting voted to put the revisions in the proposed regulation out for an additional 60-day period of public comment.
Purpose: The commission has promulgated this regulation to achieve its statutory purpose of maintaining horse racing in the Commonwealth of the highest quality.
The proposed regulation reflects more closely the intent of the statute regarding the consideration of applications for participation in horse racing thereby eliminating the provisional permit.
Furthermore, the regulation takes into account changes in standard operating procedures found at most racetracks in the mid-Atlantic region since the current regulation was promulgated eight years ago.
The proposed regulation V *** pH-6.5-9.5 VI iv iv 6h IV 6i IV PWS pH-6.5-9.5 Virginia Register of Regulations 30 Proposed Regulations amends the existing regulation pertaining to participants in horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering to promote the public health, safety and welfare.
Substance: The proposed regulation repeals the sections pertaining to provisional permits and clarifies the procedures under which applications for permits shall be considered by the commission.
The regulation also clarifies the responsibilities of participants regarding alcohol and drug testing, provision of workers' compensation insurance coverage for employees, disorderly conduct and unwarranted objections.
The regulation also specifies that permit holders shall provide a current mailing address.
Further, the regulation incorporates the practices of other jurisdictions, primarily Maryland, regarding the responsibilities placed upon owners of racehorses.
These amendments were necessitated by the demise of the thoroughbred ownership registry of The Jockey Club.
The proposed regulation incorporates the practices of other jurisdictions as to the responsibilities placed upon jockeys and apprentice jockeys.
It also introduces an apprentice certificate that has been instituted among the racing states in the midAtlantic region.
It also establishes a multiple engagement regulation for a jockey that parallels regulations in other jurisdictions.
The proposed action more appropriately shifts four categories of permit holders from the chapter pertaining to racing officials to the chapter pertaining to participants.
Following the public hearing and the close of the period of public comment, commission staff held extensive meetings with racing officials, representatives of the Jockeys' Guild and the Maryland Jockey Club.
As a result, the following sections were revised after the regulation was published in its proposed version.
The revisions are: 11 VAC 10-60-10: In subsection H, the felonies considered detrimental to horse racing in the Commonwealth are specified, and in subsection V, the original language is restored but the levels of alcohol content are reduced.
11 VAC 10-60-40: In subsection C, the original language is restored and the proposed language is stricken.
In subsection D, the age limitation is stricken from the proposed version.
In subsection H, the term of leases is stricken.
In subsection I, the word "written" is substituted for the word "notarized" and the requirement of a legal name accompanying a stable name is stricken.
The registration requirements, notification of a change of trainer, and prohibitions on owners in subsections K, L and M are stricken.
11 VAC 10-60-70: In subsection D, the revision allows a trainer to participate as a jockey but the jockey may only ride horses he trains.
In subsection F, the provision for workers' compensation insurance is eliminated as unnecessary.
In subsection G, the wording "or a permit in Virginia" is added to conform to other similar provisions.
11 VAC 10-60-120: In subsection T, the revised language clarifies the weighing in procedures and the amount of overweight carried by the jockey during the running of a race.
11 VAC 10-60-320: The revised language eliminates the requirement upon the track superintendent of having the Volume 16, Issue 1 31 necessary personnel and equipment available.
It has been determined that this is the responsibility of the licensee and not one of its employees.
Issues: The proposed regulation was promulgated with the input of counsel from the Attorney General's Office as well as the commission's experience in operating the first five race meetings at Colonial Downs.
Furthermore, representatives of the horse industry, primarily the Jockeys' Guild and racing officials from Colonial Downs and the Maryland Jockey Club were intensely involved in the revision of the proposed regulation.
The proposed regulation essentially updates the previous regulation by eliminating outmoded procedures.
The proposed regulation further creates the advantage of providing uniformity among neighboring jurisdictions while not creating a disadvantage for the Commonwealth or the public.
Summary: The proposed amendments incorporate the changes in standard operating procedures for racetracks in the midAtlantic region; allow licensees reciprocity if licensed in another state with similar regulatory requirements; and clarify sections with permit application procedures, including the repeal of provisional permits.
The proposed version of the regulation has been revised to reflect the public comment received during the public hearing and the period of public comment.
11 VAC 10-60-10.
Generally.
No person shall participate in any horse racing subject to the jurisdiction of the commission or in the conduct of a race meeting or pari-mutuel wagering of the race meeting unless the person possesses a permit from the commission and complies with the provisions of the Act and the regulations of the commission.
Permits issued by the commission are not transferable.
A. Application for permit.
A person desiring to obtain a permit to participate in horse racing, with pari-mutuel wagering, shall make an application for a permit on a form prescribed by the commission.
The application shall be accompanied by a fee prescribed by the commission and the cost of fingerprinting.

Regulations for Administration of the Virginia Hearing Impairment Identification and Monitoring System (amending 12 VAC 5-80-10, 12 VAC 5-80-20, 12 VAC 5-80-30, 12 VAC 5-80-40, 12 VAC 5-80-80, and 12 VAC 5-80-90; adding 12 VAC 5-8095; and repealing 12 VAC 5-80-50, 12 VAC 5-80-100, 12 VAC 5-80-110, and 12 VAC 5-80-120).
Statutory Authority: Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 32.1-12 and 32.1-64.1 of the Code of Virginia.
Public Hearing Date: N/A -- Public comments may be submitted until November 26, 1999.
(See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: The existing Virginia Hearing Impairment Identification and Monitoring System was adopted in 1987 under the authority of Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 32.1-64.1 and 32.1-64.2 of the Code of Virginia.
Section 32.1-64.1 of the Code requires the State Health Commissioner to establish and maintain the Virginia Hearing Impairment Identification and Monitoring System and requires the State Board of Health to promulgate regulations for implementing this system.
In addition, SB 591 (1998 Acts of Assembly, Chapter 506) amended Ã¯Â¿Â½ 32.1-64.1 to require the State Board of Health to "provide by regulation for the giving of hearing screening tests for all infants born in all hospitals," thereby requiring the proposed amendments.
Purpose: The purpose of the regulations and the intended amendments is to provide consistent guidance for the implementation and administration of a system designed to ensure that all infants born in Virginia with hearing loss are identified and receive appropriate intervention at the earliest possible age after birth.
This system promotes early intervention that is crucial in preventing learning problems, social problems and costly remedial education activities for children with hearing loss.
The amendments are needed to improve and hone the system and allow it to comport with the changes in the law.
Substance: The proposed regulations will specify the responsibilities of hospitals with neonatal intensive care services, hospitals with newborn nurseries, the Virginia Department of Health, and persons providing audiological services to children following discharge from the hospital after birth.
These responsibilities are identified as beginning July 1, 1999, and July 1, 2000.
As required by SB 591, on July 1, 1999, hospitals with neonatal intensive care services will be responsible for screening the hearing of all infants prior to discharge after birth, providing test results and other pertinent information to the parent and the child's primary medical care provider, and reporting those results and other data to the Virginia Department of Health.
Hospitals with newborn nurseries and no neonatal intensive care services will be responsible for identifying infants who are at risk for hearing loss, as they are required to do under the current regulations; providing specific Volume 16, Issue 1 49 information and recommendations for follow-up to the parent and to the child's primary medical care provider; and reporting those infants who are at risk to the Virginia Department of Health.
Hospitals that are not required to screen the hearing of all infants before July 1, 2000, but elect to do so will not be required to report infants who are at risk for hearing loss.
They will be given the same responsibilities as hospitals with neonatal intensive care services.
As of July 1, 2000, all hospitals with newborn nurseries and all hospitals with neonatal intensive care services will be responsible for screening the hearing of all infants prior to discharge after birth, providing test results and other pertinent information to the child's parent and to the child's primary medical care provider, and reporting those results and other data to the Virginia Department of Health.
The Virginia Department of Health will be responsible for (i) collecting, maintaining and evaluating the data reported by hospitals, reports from audiological follow-up and information regarding intervention referrals in a database; (ii) providing follow-up for reported infants that includes letters and information to parents; (iii) supplying the reporting format, written information, as well as training and technical assistance on the program to hospitals; (iv) conducting a yearly review and evaluation of the program; and (v) communicating performance data to hospitals on a yearly basis.
Persons who provide audiological services to a child once that child is discharged from the hospital after birth will be responsible for providing screening or evaluation results to the parent and the child's primary medical care provider; sending a complete report to the Virginia Department of Health; advising the parent about and offering referral to early intervention and education programs; and providing the parent of any child found to have a hearing loss with information about hearing loss, such as communication and amplification options and resource agencies and services.
Issues: The primary advantages of these amendments for the public are for parents, children who are born with hearing loss, hospitals and local education agencies.
Parents will be informed of results of the hearing screening and need for further testing before their newborn is discharged from the hospital after birth.
With the early identification of a child's hearing loss, parents can make informed choices regarding early intervention and education methods that will benefit both the child and the family.
Recent research suggests that when hearing loss is identified by three months of age and intervention is offered before six months of age, children with hearing loss stay competitive with hearing peers in language and social skills.
Further, the advantages remain regardless of the level of hearing loss, the child's cognitive skills or the method of intervention.
The amount of information that hospitals will be required to report to the Virginia Department of Health is reduced, as they are currently submitting a report form on every infant discharged after birth.
With the early identification of hearing loss, there will be a savings to local education agencies.
Research suggests that Monday, September 27, 1999 Proposed Regulations costs of special education services are reduced when hearing loss is identified and intervention initiated within the first year of life.
There are no disadvantages to the public or to the agency.
Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98).
Section 96.14:7.1 G requires that such economic impact analyses include, but need not be limited to, the projected number of businesses or other entities to whom the regulation would apply, the identity of any localities and types of businesses or other entities particularly affected, the projected number of persons and employment positions to be affected, the projected costs to affected businesses or entities to implement or comply with the regulation, and the impact on the use and value of private property.
The analysis presented below represents DPB's best estimate of these economic impacts.
Summary of the proposed regulation.
Section 32.1-64.1 of the Code of Virginia requires the State Health Commissioner to establish and maintain the Virginia Hearing Impairment Identification and Monitoring System and requires the State Board of Health to promulgate regulations for implementing this system.
The 1998 General Assembly (Chapter 506) amended Ã¯Â¿Â½ 32.1-64.1 to require the State Board of Health to "provide by regulation for the giving of hearing screening tests for all infants born in all hospitals."
The proposed changes to this regulation are designed to comply with this mandate.
Estimated economic impact.
Under current regulations, hospitals are required to screen the hearing of only those infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) who are identified to be at risk for hearing impairment according to specific indicators.
According to the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), approximately 10% of Virginia newborns are admitted to a NICU.
Since presumably not all NICU infants exhibit the specified risk indicators, hospitals are required to screen the hearing of fewer than 10% of Virginia newborns.
The proposed amended regulation requires that starting July 1, 1999, all hospitals with neonatal intensive care services screen the hearing of all newborns, whether or not they have been admitted to the NICU.
In 1996, 59% (54,130 out of 92,115) of the children born in Virginia hospitals were born in hospitals with a NICU.
As of July 1, 2000, the proposed amended regulation requires all Virginia hospitals to screen the hearing of all their newborns.
Increasing the percentage of newborns screened for hearing impairment from less than 10% to 100% will be costly, but will have clear, if not entirely quantifiable benefits.
In a study (Colorado study) published in the journal Pediatrics1 it was shown that at 26 Colorado hospitals which screened all their newborns for hearing impairment, 50% of the children that were proven to have congenital hearing loss did not exhibit the standard risk factors.
Thus, it is likely that if Virginia 1 screens the hearing of all newborns instead of only NICU newborns that exhibit specified risk factors, the number of Virginia infants who are diagnosed with congenital hearing loss shortly after birth may increase twofold or more.
For the 90% of children with congenital hearing loss who do not have profound hearing loss, research has shown that through early hearing amplification and appropriate therapy these children achieve near-normal language development, significantly exceeding the language development of comparable children not identified until after 6 months of age2.
For the children with profound hearing loss, early detection allows for early initiation of sign language or cochlear implants, if appropriate.
In the Colorado study it was calculated that on average it costs $25 per infant to screen all newborns.
That calculation takes account of labor costs, disposable supplies and amortized capital equipment costs.
The average costs for the screening of newborns for other maladies are less per infant, but the occurrence of those maladies are significantly less common.
According to the Colorado study, screening costs per confirmed diagnosis are as follows: $9,600 for congenital hearing loss, $10,800 for hypothyroidism, $23,100 for hemoglobinopathy and $40,500 for PKU.
Screenings for the last three maladies in that list are currently conducted for all newborns in Virginia.
In addition to improved language development, early detection of hearing impairment allows for some reduction of costs that otherwise would occur.
According to the Colorado study, additional expenses accrue for children not diagnosed at birth who go on to require some form of special intervention once they reach school age.
The study asserts that all screening costs could be recovered after 10 years due to subsequent savings in avoided intervention.
Though that calculation may be optimistic, it is noteworthy that at least some of the screening costs may be recouped through avoided intervention.
The net economic impact of the proposed changes to this regulation would likely be positive.
It is very likely that the proposed increase in screening would result in significantly increased early detection of congenital hearing loss.
The additional children diagnosed with hearing impairment would be able to receive early treatment, which would most likely significantly improve their language skills.
This would provide the non-quantifiable benefit of happier children and parents, as well as an improved economic future.
The cost of the proposed screenings would be about the same or less per confirmed diagnosis as other health screenings currently conducted in Virginia for all newborns.
The initial screening costs would also be countered somewhat by a reduction in the future costs of special intervention for students with language deficiencies and hearing problems.
Businesses and entities affected.
The 67 Virginia hospitals with newborn nurseries and the one Virginia hospital with a NICU but no nursery would all be affected by the proposed A.L. Mehl and V. Thomson, "Newborn Hearing Screening: The Great Omission," Pediatrics, 101(1), January 1998.
2 C. Yoshinaga-Itano, "Efficacy of Early Identification and Early Intervention," Seminars in Hearing, 16 (2), 115-123.
Virginia Register of Regulations 50 Proposed Regulations changes to this regulation.
Health insurers that may cover part or all of the expense of screening would also be affected.
Localities particularly affected.
The proposed regulatory changes affect all Virginia localities.
Projected impact on employment.
VDH estimates that each hospital will likely need to hire a 25% FTE audiologist or nurse to run the program, plus additional hours for a nurse or technician to run the tests (the number of hours depend on the number of newborns at the hospital).
Effects on the use and value of private property.
The implementation of the proposed regulatory changes would require the purchase of hearing screening equipment for many of Virginia's hospitals with nurseries, but no NICU.
VDH estimates that the equipment would cost between $10,000 to $15,000.
Firms that sell such equipment would clearly benefit while hospitals would incur an additional expense.
Agency's Response to the Department of Planning and Budget's Economic Impact Analysis: The Department of Planning and Budget (DPB) analyzed the economic impact of this proposed regulation in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9-6.14:7.1 G of the Administrative Process Act and Executive Order Number 25 (98) and submitted that analysis on July 9, 1999.
The Virginia Department of Health agrees with DPB's overall analysis.
Summary: The proposed amendments comply with the statutory changes to Ã¯Â¿Â½ 32.1-64.1 of the Code of Virginia.
The purpose of the regulations is to provide consistent guidance for the implementation and administration of a system designed to ensure that all infants born in Virginia with hearing loss are identified and receive appropriate intervention at the earliest possible age after birth.
The proposed regulation will amend the responsibilities of hospitals with neonatal intensive care services and hospitals with newborn nurseries regarding newborn hearing screening, parent education and follow-up; modify the newborn hearing screening protocols; amend the Virginia Department of Health responsibilities; and add reporting requirements for persons who provide audiological services to children following discharge from the hospital after birth.
These responsibilities are identified as beginning July 1, 1999, in hospitals with neonatal intensive care services and July 1, 2000, in all hospitals with newborn nurseries.

This regulatory action was initially proposed in 15:25 VA.R. 3327-3328 August 30, 1999.
New proposed changes are shown in brackets.
Title of Regulation: 14 VAC 5-395-10 et seq.
Rules Governing Settlement Agents (amending 14 VAC 5-395-20 and 14 VAC 5-395-60; adding 14 VAC 5-395-25).
Statutory Authority: Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 6.1-2.25 and 12.1-13 of the Code of Virginia.
Summary: This regulation was promulgated in 1997 to carry out the provisions of the Consumer Real Estate Settlement Protection Act (Ã¯Â¿Â½ 6.1-2.19 et seq. of the Code of Virginia).
The original proposed changes contained in the draft attached to the State Corporation Commission's "Order To Take Notice" date July 28, 1999, are being made to comply with the provisions enacted during the 1999 Session of the Virginia General Assembly pursuant to Senate Bill No. 1278 (Chapter 647 of the 1999 Acts of Assembly) regarding "lay real estate settlement agents."
Changes are also being proposed to require settlement agents to keep separate escrow accounts for Virginia settlement funds.
The revised proposed changes contained in the latest draft attached to the State Corporation Commission's "Order to Take Notice" dated August 31, 1999, clarify that a "lay real estate settlement agent" who provides escrow, closing, or settlement services in transactions involving multiple parcels or tracts of real estate located wholly or partially outside of Virginia must maintain another separate escrow account for those settlement funds.
This latest revision takes into account the fact that lay real estate settlement agents may provide settlement services on real estate involving multiple locations, some of which may be located in other states.

Regulations Governing the Practice of Physical Therapy (amending 18 VAC 85-31-10, 18 VAC 85-31-40, 18 VAC 85-31-50, 18 VAC 85-31-60, 18 VAC 85-31-80, 18 VAC 85-31-90, 18 VAC 85-31-100, 18 VAC 85-31-120, 18 VAC 85-31-130, and 18 VAC 85-31-140; adding 18 VAC 85-31-25, 18 VAC 85-31-65, and 18 VAC 85-31-135).
Statutory Authority: Ã¯Â¿Â½ 54.1-2400 and Chapter 29 (Ã¯Â¿Â½ 54.12900 et seq.) of the Code of Virginia.
Public Hearing Date: November 19, 1999 - 8 a.m.
Public comments may be submitted until November 26, 1999.
(See Calendar of Events section for additional information) Basis: Chapters 24 (Ã¯Â¿Â½ 54.1-2400 et seq.) and 29 (Ã¯Â¿Â½ 54.1-2900 et seq.) of Title 54.1 of the Code of Virginia provide the basis for these regulations.
Chapter 24 establishes the general powers and duties of health regulatory boards including the power to establish qualifications for licensure and responsibility to promulgate regulations.
Sections 54.1-2942 through 54.1-2948 establish the requirement for the licensure of physical therapists and physical therapy assistants and specifies the powers and duties of the Advisory Board on Physical Therapy.
Purpose: Amendments are proposed pursuant to a biennial review of regulations as required by the Public Participation Guidelines of the Board of Medicine and by Executive Order 25(98).
As a result of its review, the board proposes amendments to clarify the use of unlicensed persons in the practice of physical therapy, to require proof of English proficiency for graduates of schools located outside the United States or Canada, to require graduates of nonapproved schools to provide documentation of certification by the Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical Virginia Register of Regulations 58 Proposed Regulations Therapy, to establish the passing score for the examination, and to clarify certain requirements for practice and supervision of physical therapy assistants.
In addition, the proposed amendments establish an inactive licensure status and those requirements for renewal or reinstatement of licensure which are necessary to protect the public health and safety in the delivery of physical therapy services.
Substance: 18 VAC 85-31-10.
Definitions are proposed for (i) an "approved program" to specify those educational programs which are accredited for licensure; (ii) "FCCPT" as the Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical Therapy; and (iii) "nonlicensed personnel as an individual not licensed or certified by a health regulatory board and is performing patient care functions at the direction of a physical therapist or a physical therapist assistant.
An amendment is proposed in the definition of "inactive practice trainee" to clarify the meaning of "inactive" as not having practiced for at least 320 hours within the past four years and as consistent with terminology used elsewhere in the regulations.
18 VAC 85-31-25.
A new section is proposed to require licensees to furnish current name and address within 30 days of any change and to specify that notices mailed or served by the board to the name and address on file shall be validly given.
18 VAC 85-31-40.
The section on educational requirements is amended to specify that graduates of approved programs outside the United States or Canada must pass the Test of English as a Foreign Language or provide proof of English proficiency.
18 VAC 85-31-50.
Regulations are amended for graduates of schools which are not approved by the board to require that such applicants in physical therapy provide documentation of certification by the FCCPT as evidence of equivalency in education and training.
The requirements for a foreigntrained physical therapist assistant and for a traineeship have not been amended.
18 VAC 85-31-65 has been added to specify the current requirements for an examination and to set out the minimum passing score on the exam as a scale score of 600 or a score to be established by the advisory board.
18 VAC 85-31-80.
An amendment is proposed to clarify that an applicant for licensure by endorsement who has not been practicing in another jurisdiction for at least 320 hours within the four years immediately preceding application meet the requirements for a traineeship in 18 VAC 85-31-140.
Other amendments in 18 VAC 85-31-80 are editorial.
18 VAC 85-31-90.
Amendments are proposed to clarify that the physical therapist gets a referral for treatment from a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, podiatry or dental surgery.
18 VAC 85-31-100.
An amendment is proposed to change the term "physical therapy aide," which is not a category of practitioner created by statute to the term "unlicensed personnel," which is defined in the regulation.
An amendment is also proposed to clarify that the physical therapist shall supervise no more than three trainees at any one time.
Volume 16, Issue 1 59 18 VAC 85-31-120.
Amendments are intended to clarify the schedule by which a physical therapist must reevaluate a patient who is receiving treatment by a physical therapy assistant.
18 VAC 85-31-135.
A new section is proposed to allow a practitioner to request an inactive license without requiring evidence of continuing practice in physical therapy.
Such a license does not entitle the licensee to perform any act which would require a license to practice.
The proposed amendments would also establish a fee for inactive licensure and add requirements for reinstatement of an inactive license to active status to include evidence of active practice hours in another jurisdiction equal to the number of years of inactivity and payment of the difference between the cost of an active and inactive license.
An inactive licensee who cannot meet the requirement of active hours of practice must meet the requirements for a traineeship as specified in 18 VAC 85-31140.
18 VAC 85-31-140.
An amendment is proposed to clarify the requirement for evidence of active practice in order to reinstate a license and to specify that a traineeship must be under the supervision of a physical therapist and to clarify who is required to do a traineeship as set forth in subsection A.
The requirement for reexamination after a period of seven years of inactivity is deleted.
Issues: ISSUE 1: Type and amount of continuing competency requirements.
In response to the statutory mandate for the Board of Medicine to develop regulations for the assurance of the continued competency of all its licensees, the advisory board reviewed its current requirement for hours of active practice as a prerequisite for renewal of licensure.
In these proposed regulations, there are no amendments for continuing education or other type of evidence of continued competency.
However, the advisory board is continuing to monitor the research on continued competency, the requirements of other states, and the availability of credentialing organizations offering continued competency courses or activities.
ISSUE 2: Requirements for reactivation of an inactive or lapsed license.
In current regulations, there is a requirement for at least 320 hours of practice within the preceding four years in order to renew a license.
The board is proposing an inactive license at a reduced renewal fee for those practitioners who want to take a leave of absence or are now out of state and have no intention of engaging in active practice in the Commonwealth.
In doing so, requirements for reactivation of such a license are necessary to ensure that practitioners are competent to resume practice.
The board determined that it was necessary for a practitioner whose license has been inactive to provide evidence of continuing competency hours equal to the amount of time the license has not been active.
If a practitioner has not engaged in active practice during the time the license was inactive in Virginia, the board currently requires that he serve a board-approved traineeship of 480 hours under the supervision of a licensed physical therapist.
Monday, September 27, 1999 Proposed Regulations Advantages or disadvantages to the licensees.
The inactive licensure status will be beneficial to practitioners who are not currently living or practicing in the Commonwealth.
They will be able to maintain a license at a reduced cost.
If they choose to reactivate and return to practice, they will not have to apply for reinstatement or pay back renewal fees and penalty fees.
They will only have to indicate that they have the required hours of active practice in another jurisdiction or have served the requisite traineeship and pay the difference between the inactive and active renewal fee.
There are no disadvantages to licensees who will have the option of requesting inactive licensure.
Advantages or disadvantages to the public.
Inactive licensure has no significant advantages or disadvantages to the public; these are persons who are not authorized the practice physical therapy in Virginia.
Inactive licensure may have a minor positive impact on access to physical therapy services in that it would be less costly and burdensome for an inactive licensee who has taken a break from professional practice or has been living out of state to return to active practice and employment in Virginia.
The public is well served by a requirement for a board-approved traineeship under supervision if a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant has not been professionally active for a period of time.
Such a practice will provide assurance by the observation and guidance of a licensed therapist that the applicant for licensure or relicensure has regained his ability to practice.
ISSUE 3: Licensure requirements for applicants trained in foreign schools.
a.
Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) requirement for graduates of approved schools.
Graduates of schools approved by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education of the American Physical Therapy Association are recognized by the board as having met its educational requirements for licensure.
Those schools were traditionally located in the U.S. or Canada, so English proficiency was not an issue.
The commission has begun approving schools in foreign countries, so the board has determined that a test of English (TOEFL) or some other proof of English proficiency is necessary.
For example, if a graduate attended a school in Great Britain or a citizen of the U.S. attended a school in a foreign country, the TOEFL test would not be required.
b. Documentation of certification by the Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical Therapy for graduates of nonapproved schools.
As far as the board has been able to determine, the only "nonapproved schools" of physical therapy are located outside the United States and Canada.
(The new school of physical therapy located at Shenandoah University will have accreditation completed before it graduates any students.)
With foreign-trained therapists, there has been a problem throughout the U.S. with persons getting green cards or temporary occupational visas to work in this country as physical therapists who, once they get to the U.S., find that they do not meet the requirements for licensure in any state.
Recent reforms in the immigration laws of the U.S. have created a requirement for internationally educated health care professionals entering the country to meet certain criteria before being granted a visa or applying for licensure.
To ensure that those criteria have been met prior to entering the U.S., persons are being required to obtain prescreening certification.
Through the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy, the Foreign Credentialing Commission on Physical Therapy has been authorized to review credentials for the purpose of determining eligibility to be licensed as a physical therapist.
The board is proposing that certification by the FCCPT be required for international candidates from nonapproved educational programs.
From its review of the criteria for certification by FCCPT, the board determined that in every way its requirements met or exceeded Virginia's requirements for licensure, with one exception the lack of a traineeship in the U.S.
The board will continue to require a traineeship in Virginia to ensure through supervised practice that the foreign-trained applicant has the knowledge, skills and English proficiency to communicate with and practice safely on patients in the Commonwealth.
Requiring certification by FCCPT will eliminate the need for submission to the board of documents on educational programs, equivalency of degrees, translations from embassies, proof of English proficiency, and verification of licensure status in another country.
Advantages or disadvantages to the licensees.
The TOEFL examination is the nationally recognized standard for determining English proficiency for internationals seeking to practice a profession in the U.S.
To require a different standard would be burdensome, since the TOEFL exam is readily available at schools located in other countries.
Students who can clearly demonstrate English proficiency will not be required to take the TOEFL exam.
Since prescreening is required for entry into the U.S., applicants who have to get FCCPT certification will not have an unnecessary burden or barrier to licensure.
The prescreening process will eliminate the unfortunate situation of a foreign-trained physical therapist sacrificing to come to the U.S. only to find that he is not eligible to sit for the examination or to become licensed in any state.
Prescreening may also reduce the extremely high failure rate for foreign-trained graduates on the national licensure examination (out of the 30 foreign-trained applicants currently pending with the Board of Medicine, 27 have already failed the licensure examination at least once).
Advantages or disadvantages to the public.
The public is better protected by having potential licensees prescreened for their ability to practice safely in Virginia and to communicate in English with their patients.
The FCCPT will authenticate the licensure status of any person who has been licensed or certified in another country, evaluate the equivalency of his degree, and ensure English proficiency.
ISSUE 4: Clarification of practice responsibilities.
The Code of Virginia requires a referral from a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, chiropractic, podiatry or dental surgery for treatment by a physical therapist.
In 18 VAC 85-31-90, the title clearly referred to those particular practitioners, but the regulation spoke of the "referring practitioner."
As a result, Virginia Register of Regulations 60 Proposed Regulations there have been questions about whether a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant working for physician could make the referral as the "referring practitioner."
An amendment will clarify the requirement and make it explicitly consistent with the Code.
Currently, regulations provide for the practice and supervision of a physical therapy aide; such a category of practitioner was not created in the statute and therefore should not be created by regulation.
The proposal establishes a definition for "unlicensed personnel" and utilizes that terminology in the regulation.
Two other practice issues have been addressed to specify more clearly the requirements and policies of the board.
Supervision by a physical therapist of trainees is restricted to no more than three; the proposed amendment would clarify that it means three trainees at any one time.
The schedule for reevaluation by a physical therapists of a patient being treated by a physical therapist assistant has been edited for greater clarity.
Advantages or disadvantages to the licensees and the public.
Greater clarity in the language of the regulation will serve to ensure more consistent compliance with regulations.
Licensees will not inadvertently or unintentionally violate some provision of the requirements nor will they be pressured to accept a patient from a practitioner who is not authorized by law to make such a referral.
The public is better protected by regulations which are specific in their requirements for practice and for supervision of unlicensed persons working in a physical therapy pra
