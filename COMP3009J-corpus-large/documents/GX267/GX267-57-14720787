n the six months since the declared end to major combat actions, the New York National Guard has seen troops both return home from Operation Iraqi Freedom and prepare for deployment to support the rebuilding efforts of the coalition.
"The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but it is worth every effort," said President George W. Bush during his address from the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003.
"Our coalition will stay until our work is done.
Then we will leave, and we will leave behind a free Iraq," he said.
Hundreds of members of the New York Air National Guard as well as Naval Militia members of the Marine Corps Reserve returned from duties throughout the Middle East this summer even as other Army National Guard units received initial alert orders for mobilization.
"While our families, friends, and communities welcome home our brave men and women of the National Guard, we remain all too aware that this conflict is not yet over," said Maj. Gen. Thomas P. Maguire, The Adjutant General.
"Our nation is at war and we shall continue to provide troops for federal missions still to come," he said.
Other units continue to support the Homeland Security missions for Operation Noble Eagle, with security operations continuing at New York's Air National Guard bases and state active duty service throughout New York City and key power plants in the state.
The sustainment of Guard and Reserve forces for the nation's Global War on Terror is the largest since World War II.
"Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power," said President George W. Bush in his State of the Union Address in January of 2003.
"In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this nation made a pledge: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men -- free people will set the course of history."
The soldiers from the 27th Infantry Brigade's 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry are expected to mobilize later this fall for deployment to Iraq in 2004.
Other New York National Guard units prepare for possible mobilizations in the new year as part of the nation's rotation of forces throughout Central Command.

Guard Notes Bush Establishes Medals for Global War on Terror WASHINGTON, D.C.
(American Forces Press Service) -- President Bush issued an executive order establishing two military awards for actions in the global war on terrorism.
The president signed the order March 12 establishing the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.
A White House spokesman said the medals recognize the "sacrifices and contributions" military members make in the global war on terror.
The Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal will be awarded to service members who serve in military expeditions to combat terrorism on or after Sept. 11, 2001.
Operation Enduring Freedom is the prime operation the medal may be awarded for.
Personnel assigned to operations in Afghanistan and the Philippines are examples of service members who will receive the award.
The Global War on Terrorism Service Medal will be awarded to service members who serve in military operations to combat terrorism on or after Sept. 11, 2001.
Operation Noble Eagle is an example of the type of operation the medal may be awarded for.
The awards do not take the place of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, established Dec. 4, 1961, or the Armed Forces Service Medal, established Jan. 11, 1996.
"Any member who qualified for those medals by reason of service in operations to combat terrorism between September 11, 2001, and a terminal date to be determined by the Secretary of Defense, shall remain qualified for those medals," the executive order reads.
"Upon application, any such member may be awarded either the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal or the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal in lieu of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal or the Armed Forces Service Medal."
No one may be awarded more than one of the four medals for service in the same approved expedition or operation to combat terrorism.
No one is entitled to more than one award of the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal or the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.
The medals may be awarded posthumously.
DoD and military service officials, including the Coast Guard, are working on provisions to award the medals.
TAG Talk Impact of 9-11 will Guide our Lives for Years to Come It goes without saying what extraordinary times we live in.
And, the citizensoldiers, airmen and women, and sailors and Marines of New York State's military forces, are surely on the cusp of these momentous days.
The facts are that since Sept. 11, 2001, no American has entirely escaped either the physical consequences, or emotional toll, of the terrorist attack on America, the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.
That's monumentally so for members of the U.S. Armed Services -- across-the-board Â­ and particularly New York's National Guard.
It was literally a matter of weeks and hours after I was sworn in as your Adjutant General, in August, 2001 , that travail and uncertainty were thrust upon the Guard as a whole, as well as on our professional and personal lives.
The Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist assault on America is still as piercing and poignant to me and so many fellow soldiers today, as it was that crisp, sunny but eventually devastating Tuesday morning.
Though we will collectively have just marked the 2nd anniversary of 9-11, it appears to many of us that we've lived practically a lifetime.
In the succeeding months, since those intense moments when two terrorist hijacked passenger planes careened into the Twin Towers, the United States, in rapid fire order, launched the War on Terrorism, established Homeland Security with Operation Noble Eagle, organized Operation Enduring Freedom, invaded Afghanistan, and successfully toppled the tyrannical Taliban dictatorship from power.
Barely pausing for a reasonable break, U.S. and coalition forces went on in quick fashion to put together Operation Iraqi Freedom, uprooting the nefarious regime of Saddam Hussein, thus setting Iraq on an irreversible course towards representative government and democracy.
Throughout it all, the President and the Department of Defense have counted heavily on the National Guard and reserve force components to augment and power U.S. and coalition combat forces to victory.
Such is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
In this edition of National Guard Times, readers will find news of successive deployments and redeployments of Guard forces, as they continue to make top of the TV news hours and front page coverage, not only with local and regional media, but state and nationwide as well.
You'll read about the tragic loss of the National Guard's first combat casualty in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Sergeant Heath McMillen, age 29, of Clifton Springs, near
Maj. Gen. Thomas P. Maguire, Jr., The Adjutant General Canandaigua, NY.
The father of three, Sergeant McMillen was patrolling a convoy route 20 miles south of Baghdad with other members of his unit, when an enemy explosive device was triggered next to his humvee.
The blast ripped through the vehicle, mortally wounding Sergeant McMillen, and injuring his comrade, Spc. Brett Goheen of Medina, NY.
Our deepest and heartfelt thoughts and condolences go out to Sergeant McMillen's widow, Kelly, the children, Mom and Dad, the entire family, friends and loved ones.
The truth is that words on occasions like these are woefully inadequate.
You'll examine, also, the return of 230 soldiers of the NYARNG's 1st Battalion, 127th Armor Regiment from their one-year mobilization to support Operation Noble Eagle.
Deployed to federal sites throughout the northeast, the soldiers left behind families, friends and their heavy main battle tanks for security duty such as vehicle searches, patrols and checkpoints.
"Homeland security is teamwork at its finest.
Each of you were on the front lines for families, friends and neighbors," City of Buffalo Mayor Anthony M. Masiello told returning soldiers at the headquarters company arrival ceremony.
Across from this page you'll be reading, too, about Governor George Pataki's signing of the far-reaching Patriot Plan Law, July 3, 2003, at the Lexington Avenue armory in Manhattan.
From a state perspective, and historically speaking, this benefits law is a de facto Magna Carta for National Guard members and reservists throughout New York.
As I proudly stated in the previous issue of the Guard Times, you'd have to go back to the days of Nelson A. Rockefeller (19591974) or Al Smith (1919-1921, 1923-29) to find a Governor even approaching the level of devotion and concern Governor Pataki has provided to his soldiers, airmen, sailors or Marines.
It is an absolute priority of mine to help make the promise and hope of the Patriot Plan a reality for all the troops and their families it is intended to assist!
Deployment Stipends to Continue in New Fiscal Year WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Army News Service) -- Soldiers deployed to high threat areas will continue to receive Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Pay when the new fiscal year starts Oct. 1, said Department of Defense officials Aug 15.
In April, Congress authorized an increase in both Family Separation Allowance, from $100 to $250 and Imminent Danger Pay, from $150 to $225.
These increases were part of the FY 03 DoD Supplemental Funding.
This funding was temporary and will expire Sept. 30 at the end of this fiscal year.
If Congress doesn't vote to renew the increases in Family Separation and Imminent Danger Pay, the DoD will use "other authority available to the department to make up for any shortfalls," a DoD press release stated.
This means troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan will not see a cut in their takehome pay.
"We are not going to reduce their compensation," said David S.C.
Chu, defense undersecretary for personnel and readiness.
Shades of Green at Disney World to Reopen in 2004 ORLANDO, FL (American Forces Press Service) - The refurbished Armed Forces Recreation Center Shades of Green on Walt Disney World Resort won't open until March 1, 2004, instead of the originally planned Dec. 15, 2003, date.
Unexpected construction delays caused officials to move the date back 76 days, according to Peter F. Isaacs, chief operating officer at the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center.
The Army serves as the executive agent, operating AFRCs for DoD.
The renovation and expansion project that began in April 2002 was driven by high demand that kept the original 288 rooms at or near 100 percent occupancy.
The hotel is financially self-sufficient, and no taxpayer dollars are used in the operations or for the new construction.
When it reopens, there will be 586 new or renovated rooms, 500 new covered parking spaces and 7,500 square feet for special events.
The current room rates of $66 for E-1 through E-5 will only go up $4 to $70.
Other rates are computed on a sliding scale based on rank.
The Armed Forces Recreation Center is open to DoD ID-card holders in all branches of military service: active duty and reserve components, DoD civilians, both military and civilian DoD retirees, and their families.
"The information about our new opening date and reservations is on our web site," said McCrindle, adding, "The best way to make a reservation is to use the Web site as the phones tend to be overloaded."

Rainbow Leaders Gain Corps Perspective Sgt. 1st Class Corine L. Lombardo HQ, 42nd ID (M)
FORT LEAVENWORTH, KS eaders and soldiers from the 42nd Infantry `Rainbow' Division witnessed first hand the complex battle and staff responsibilities of an Army Corps during recent training at the Battle Command Training Program.
In mid-July, nearly 250 soldiers from the 42nd Inf. Div. deployed to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas for a two-week battle simulation exercise.
The contingent of Rainbow soldiers replicated an Army Corps headquarters and functioned as the higher control and command cell or `HICON' for more than 1,200 soldiers from the Army National Guard's 29th (Light) Infantry Division, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.
The computer simulation exercise, called Warfighter, mirrors the demands of modern warfare and places division leaders and their staff against a "free thinking" opposing force.
The intent is to sharpen planning and coordination skills for combat operations and provide doctrinally based training assistance across all battlefield operating systems and specialties.
The fast paced and high stress environment is designed to demonstrate what combat division staff elements will face while preparing for and conducting contingency operations throughout the world.
Last year more than a thousand members of the Rainbow Division deployed for it's own multi-echelon Warfighter exercise.
"The significant experience we gained last year allowed us to effectively guide the 29th Division through theirs" said Brig. Gen.
L
Vincent Lucenti, 42nd Inf. Div. Deputy Commander for Maneuver, adding, "this is an exceptional example of using all the lessons learned from our own Warfighter."
In addition to traditional combat warfare issues, the soldiers faced other challenges that portray the nature of current Army combat missions: political and ethnic unrest, synchronizing information operations, media on the battlefield, dealing with non-government organizations, handling displaced civilians on the battlefield and coordinating assistance to reestablish a nation's infrastructure.
"Although our primary focus was to support the 29th Infantry Division, the Rainbow took advantage of this opportunity to fine tune our own `cross talk' between staff sections, to ensure information is shared quickly and often," said Col. Mark Heffner, Division Chief of Staff.
"The HICON mission came at a time when the Rainbow was developing new primary staff and formulating cohesive working relationships that will cement the groundwork for our own future deployments," Heffner said.

The Battle Command Training Center at Fort Leavenworth provides staff training for commanders at the Brigade through Corps level, their staffs, major subordinate commanders and supporting special operations forces.
It provides a framework to conduct highly realistic and stressful combined arms training according to Army doctrine.
Most notably, it replicates uncooperative and adaptive opposing forces that fight to win.
Combined with exercise controllers, trainers and senior observers, the training reflects the challenges of the contemporary operational environment.
"the Rainbow took advantage of this opportunity to fine tune our own `cross talk' between staff sections, to ensure information is shared quickly and often," Simulating the higher command at this year's Warfighter provided Rainbow soldiers with an opportunity to experience the comprehensive obligations that U.S. Army Corps' sustain during combat operations.
"With the large number of mobilizations and real-world deployments facing the Rainbow in 2004 and beyond, this training marks our first steps for training and preparation," Heffner said.
Representatives of every 42nd Division Headquarters Staff receive congratulations from the First U.S. Army Commander, Lt. Gen. Joseph R. Inge.
Inge served as the Corps Commander during the exercise, with soldiers from the 42nd Division supporting as the corps staff.

From 60 Tons of Steel to 6 Pounds of Kids 127th Armor Leaves Tanks at Drum and Returns to Families By Maj. Richard Goldenberg HQ, 42nd ID (M)
BUFFALO ith hundreds of enthusiastic family members waiting, soldiers from the Rainbow Division's 1st Battalion, 127th Armor Regiment returned home from their one-year mobilization to support Operation Noble Eagle on Thursday, July 31st.
The 230 soldiers, more than half of the battalion's total strength mobilized one year ago for homeland security missions.
Deployed to federal sites throughout the northeast, the soldiers left behind families, friends, and their heavy main battle tanks for the security duties of vehicle searches, patrols, and checkpoints.

"Each of you were on the front lines for families, friends and neighbors" "Homeland security is teamwork at its finest.
Each of you were on the front lines for families, friends and neighbors," Buffalo Mayor Anthony M. Masiello told returning soldiers at the headquarters company redeployment ceremony.
"You allowed us to maintain our ability to work and live our lives in safety."
"There are really two great stories here," said Major Burch, the acting battalion commander.
"One is the completion of our mission for the Army and the Nation, but the other is the reunion today with our families who supported us during this deployment," he said.
Every company in the 127th Armor deployed soldiers for the security mission.
Troops manned security check-
points, provided quick reaction forces and conducted local security patrols.
"We all have a role to play and sometimes it doesn't seem all that significant when you are there on the ground," said Sgt. Timothy Makai from A Company, "but every role in the war on terror is pivotal."
The National Guard soldiers spent nine months of service at locations such as the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Army's War College at Carlisle Barracks, the Army's Picatinny Arsenal and the Letterkenny Army Depot.

"I could not have asked for more from any of our soldiers and their leaders," Burch said in his remarks.
They all returned to their home armories in Buffalo, Dunkirk, Jamestown, Olean and Ithaca from recent training in July at Fort Drum.
The battalion consolidated at Fort Drum for more than four weeks of intensive training to refamiliarize the tank crews with their primary role, armored warfare.
The companies rotated between field training and simulator training to refresh their armor skills.
"Really, this just came back easily," said Spc. Brian Laskey, a tank driver with 2nd Platoon, A Company.
"Just like riding a bike," he said.
Staff Sgt. James Robinson, also with A Company, agreed.
"We really needed to just jump back into it," he said about the training.
"The support of families and employers over the past year made this deployment successful," Burch added.
"Family life, now that will be a real good thing," echoed Sgt. Kevin Black from C Company.

Orion to Mobilize Soldiers for Iraqi Freedom 27th Brigade Troops to Join National Guard Brigades in Iraq Rotation Guard Times Staff
SYRACUSE
L
ight Infantry soldiers from the 27th Enhanced Separate Infantry Brigade began planning for a possible battalion-sized mobilization later this year as part of the Army's troop rotation in Iraq.
Announced in late July by General Jack Keane, the Acting Chief of Staff of the Army, the Orion soldiers will deploy as part of the mobilization of two Army National Guard brigades for duties overseas.
The two brigades from the Army National Guard, totaling 10,000 soldiers, will deploy to Iraq next year to support two active Army divisions earmarked to replace troops now engaged in Operation Iraqi Freedom next spring, according to Keane.
The 30th Infantry Brigade from North Carolina and the 39th Infantry Brigade from Arkansas have been alerted and "may participate in the Army unit rotation plan for Operation Iraqi Freedom," the Army announced July 26.
"We intend to alert, mobilize, train and deploy for operations and then re-deploy" The 27th Brigade similarly received alert notices for two of its infantry battalions to prepare for any possible mobilization.
Soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 105th Infantry began reviewing soldier records and conducting prescreening of individuals for mobilization later this year.
Individual armories across the state began soldier readiness checks and records reviews to identify the most likely soldiers for deployment.
The brigade's third infantry battalion, the 1st Battalion, 108th Infantry is currently supporting federal mobilizations for Operation Noble Eagle and providing soldiers for homeland security duties in the state.
The two brigades are part of the Army's plan to replace units anxious to return to their homes after leading coalition forces to victory over the regime of Saddam Hussein and to maintain the force required to stabilize that country.
"We intend to alert, mobilize, train and deploy for operations and then re-deploy," said Gen. Jack Keane, the acting Army Chief of Staff, during a briefing to reporters July 23.
"The entire deployments (for these brigades) from alert to redeployment and return to home station will last up to eighteen months."
The Orion soldiers from New York will augment Army National Guard troops from North Carolina's 30th Brigade.
A battalion from the Oregon Army National Guard's 41st Infantry Brigade will augment the 39th Brigade.
One brigade would deploy with the 1st Cavalry Division sometime between February and April of 2004 to replace the 1st Armored Division that is currently serving around Baghdad.
The other brigade would deploy with the 1st Infantry Division sometime during March or April to replace the 4th Infantry Division that is serving in northern Iraq.
The two Guard brigades would be replaced by two other Army Guard enhanced separate brigades "based on the needs of the theater," Keane said.
The intent of the National Guard brigades deployment is to sustain the level of forces that Gen. John Abizaid, the
U.S. Central Command's commander, needs to continue operations in Iraq, Keane added.
Ground forces in Iraq currently total 156,400, including 133,300 members of the active Army, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve.
Another 34,000 Army troops are in Kuwait.
All told, 15 of the Army Guard's 45 battalions from the enhanced separate brigades have been deployed overseas during this fiscal year that began last October, and 74,551 of the Army Guard's soldiers are currently deployed around the world.
That is 21 percent of the Army Guard's 352,000 citizen-soldiers.
"These deployments mark the Army's most ambitious use of National Guard brigade-size elements since World War II, when three infantry regiments from Washington state, California and Georgia, were used to round out three Army divisions," said Maj. Les Melnyk, an Army Guard historian.
The 27th Division, then a New York Army National Guard division, also mobilized for service just prior to World War II.
The 27th Division saw extensive combat service in the Pacific, with the Guard soldiers serving on active duty for
operations next year in Bosnia and Kosovo.
Rainbow soldiers from New York, Vermont and New Jersey will fill those force requirements in 2004-05.
An additional Rainbow battalion from Kentucky is scheduled to serve in the Sinai in 2004 while other Guard soldiers from the 42nd Division deploying to Europe and Guantanamo Bay for security force missions.
The enhanced separate brigades date from the 1993 Bottom-Up Review conducted by the Defense Department.
The primary mission of the National Guard's enhanced brigades is to deploy on short notice and destroy, capture or repel enemy forces, using maneuver and shock effect.
The mobilization of troops of the 27th Enhanced Separate Infantry Brigade occurs as the unit prepares some of its subordinate units for transformation.
This fall, soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 156th Field Artillery began conversion as part of new units in the New York Army National Guard.
Some of the Field Artillery troops were reflagged as new members of the Rainbow Division's 1st Battalion, 258th Field

The 30th Brigade, along with the Oregon Army National Guard's 41st Infantry Brigade were identified bythe Army for deployment to Iraq in 2004.
Light infantry soldiers from the 27th Enhanced Separate Infantry Brigade's 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment are also preparing for federal mobilization with the 30th Infantry Brigade later this year.
Both Army Guard units will roundout active duty Army Divisions as part of the scheduled rotation of troops to Iraq next year.
The soldiers are expected to serve in Iraq for up to twelve months, with additional federal service spent in predeployment training.

The chance to say thank you stretched over quite a distance.
More than a mile upstream from the beginning of the parade route, as lead vehicles were arriving at the reviewing stand, so many groups and organizations had pledged support that many of them were still waiting for their cue to march.
The parade was not only for the members of the local units.
An important theme was public recognition of military families.

Joe and Donna Muskat traveled to Niagara Falls from St. Catharines, Ontario, specifically for the parade.

God bless you.
We're so proud of you," she said.
As hundreds of people, vehicles and floats were passing the reviewing stand at the end of the parade route, visiting military dignitaries joined in the chorus of support for the 914th, 107th, 865th and 277th.

"This is one of those true hometown community events, which shows that the [military] is absolutely a part of this community.
You don't see that in many places," said Knauff.
"It shows how much support there is around here for military organizations," he added.
As the tail of the parade passed the reviewing stand, people were folding chairs and tucking away umbrellas.
Children were holding balloons with fierce grips and police were removing barriers, opening the busy commercial street for the Saturday shopping crowds.
The Niagara Region civilian community, well known for giving so much support to the local military community, had done a great thing.

Cross agrees with Blackburn's assessment of Cox and also feels that being in the military has a lot to do with Cox's attitude.
"I'm sure that she is one of those really good people.
But being in the military and having the two parts together gave here what she had to do," Cross said.
Capt. John Soltys, Chief of Detectives for the criminal investigation division of the Niagara Falls Police Department, also gives credit to Cox and her military bearing.
"It's commendable what she has done.
It's great when people get involved in their communities and it shows what can be done when they do," he said.
"I really believe that her commitment to duty went a long way in her choices and decisions to do what she did," he added.
Cox is taking the whole thing in stride.
She has no doubt that she would do the same thing again; has no doubts that she could have acted differently; and is humbled by statements from Cross and the police pointing toward a belief that she probably saved Cross' life and is solely responsible for Carlisle's capture.
"I don't know what to say.

Sponsored by the 109th Airlift Wing's Family Support Office, the Galaxy-Hercules is an annual, free of charge, five-day-long youth camp open to dependents of all Stratton Air National Guard assigned personnel.
Galaxy-Hercules centers and builds on the concept of Dreams plus Action equals Reality.
"Galaxy is an important part of our overall base youth program, and we hope to continue and expand it in the future, said Beverly Keating, the Air Wing's Family Support Coordinator.

Get Moving: New Air Force PT Test to Debut Next Year Armed Forces Press Network
WASHINGTON, DC eginning next year, Air Force officials will imple ment a new fitness test completely different than what airmen today are familiar with.
The more functional test will include a 1.5-mile timed run, a muscular-fitness test of push-ups and crunches and a body composition test.
It is designed to measure the general health of airmen, said Maj. Lisa Schmidt, chief of health promotions operations at the Air Force Surgeon General's Office.
In many respects, the fitness test will more closely resemble the Army's Physical Fitness Test, which includes push-ups, sit-ups and a timed 2 mile run.
"The goal is to have a healthy, fit force that can deploy at any time," Schmidt said.
"Our goal is to prevent the onset of diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, high-blood pressure and high cholesterol.
Basically, it is about keeping members healthy so they will perform optimally, in-garrison and deployed.
Healthy members are more heat-, stress- and fatigue-tolerant, and less prone to illness and injury."
To measure airmen's overall fitness, Schmidt's office and a panel of health and fitness experts developed a threecomponent measurement system that looks at aerobic fitness, body composition and muscular fitness, she said.
B
"The goal is to have a healthy, fit force that can deploy at any time" An airman's performance in each of the three component areas will earn points.
They can earn a maximum of 50 points on the aerobic portion of the test, 30 points on the body composition portion and 20 on the muscular fitness portion.
The total number of points earned on the fitness test will put the airman into one of four categories: 90 or greater is excellent, 75 to 89.9 is good, 70 to 74.9 is marginal, and less than 70 is poor, Schmidt said.
Airmen at Bolling Air Force Base near Washington, D.C. participate in physical-fitness training.
Their routine, which includes push-ups, crunches and a 1.5-mile run, mirrors the proposed Air Force fitness standards, which will be implemented in January 2004.
U.S. Air Force photo by Master Sgt. Jim Varhegyi.
People scoring marginal on the test will attend a two-hour healthy-living workshop that focuses on improvements to lifestyle behavior, time management and fitness education, Schmidt said.
Intervention for people scoring in the poor category involves the healthy-living workshop, an individualized exercise program and a weight-loss program for those who exceed body fat standards.
It also involves mandatory exercise five days a week, she said.
The test for body composition is still being finalized, but it will measure how much body fat a person has, Schmidt said.
Tests for other components of the fitness standard have already been determined.
A 1.5-mile run will determine aerobic fitness.
Airmen who are not medically cleared to run will take the cycle-ergometry test.
Muscular fitness will be determined by both push-ups and crunches.
Airmen's scores on the new fitness test will also determine how often they need to retest.
People scoring "good" or "excellent" will retest after a year, while those scoring "marginal" will retest after six-months.
Airmen scoring "poor" will retest after 90 days.
Just how many push-ups and crunches airmen will have to do, or how fast they will have to run, has yet to be finalized.
Schmidt's office has developed draft charts for the composite score.
The fitness standards on a draft chart are tailored to both age and gender.
While the draft charts are not available yet, airmen who are not already involved in some sort of exercise program should begin now, Schmidt said.
"If you are not doing anything now and have concerns, see your doctor first," she said.
"Begin slowly with an aerobic-exercise program , working up to at least 30 minutes on most days of the week.
Muscular fitness and flexibility also need to be part of a balanced fitness program.
If you have questions about starting a fitness program, you can contact your local (health and wellness center).
They can help develop a program that's right for you."

Soldiers Hone Skills During Infantry Competition By Senior Airman Mike R. Smith HQ, 109AW

A
ugmentee soldiers assigned to the 109th Security Forces Squadron here recently competed against other soldier teams from Air National Guard bases across the state in rifle marksmanship, land navigation and obstacle course navigation at the New York National Guard Range Complex in Guilderland.
"The purpose of the meet was for us to `get back to our infantry roots' while having a friendly competition and, of course, get valuable training in the process," said Army Sgt. 1st Class Sherwood Scott, Army NCOIC for the Security Forces Squadron augmentee platoon.
Rifle marksmanship included assembly of an M16A2 while blindfolded, with a complete functions check followed by a qualification range.
Soldiers then conducted a daytime land-navigation to locate five terrain points within 2.5 hours, with points awarded for the quickest completion time and number of points found.
Night land-navigation included the simulated treatment and evacuation of an "injured" teammate and move the entire team to a grid location given by the NCOIC.
At their final point, the teams requested medical evacuation of their teammate using the proper procedures.
Points were awarded for proper first aid, navigating during hours of darkness with and without night vision
goggles, returning with the injured soldier and proper use of the 9-line medevac request.
The Obstacle course included using proper bounding and overwatch movements techniques as the soldiers proceeded through the course.
At course completion, the soldiers donned protective masks and were questioned on reporting and calls for fire while they navigated through the course.
The fastest time received the most points.
Scott added that of the eight soldier teams that competed from across the state, the soldiers from the Stratton Air Base placed First, Second and Third in the competition.
"I am very proud of the teams that represented Stratton, it's a tribute to their discipline and dedication to the uniform in which we serve," said Scott.

Crushing Rock 204th Engineers, Community Benefit Equally from Stone Quarry By Spc. Jacob Kinne Photos by Maj. Richard Goldenberg 138th MPAD
WINDSOR ncompassed by the stadium-like walls of the Windsor stone quarry, a rusted gravel screening conveyor stands beside a red, tarnished stone crusher that has seen better days.
Defenseless and tattered, the old equipment seems willing to welcome any help and since April, soldiers from Headquarters Company, 204th Engineering Battalion of Binghamton have been doing just that- helping! The 204th installed a new, more heavily equipped rock crusher known as a Crushing/Screening and Washing Plant (CSWP) at the quarry.
The CSWP is a required piece of equipment and is the only National Guard rock crushing system in the northeast.
The CSWP is not intended to replace the town's aforementioned equipment, but rather to assist with overall production of crushed aggregate.

We will be able to produce in a weekend what they produced in a month."
By operating the equipment and producing a product, the quarry section will learn to do the intended mission, which is to provide crushed stone and sand to maintain runways, helipads, and main supply routes in a wartime situation.
This quality training was sporadic for the quarry section of the 204th since their 35-ton-per-hour stone crusher became obsolete eight years ago.
"This is the first time that I have been able to operate the quarry equipment since I received training on it," said Spc. Eric Beavers a heavy equipment operator for the 204th Engineer Battalion.
"I will be filling the crusher and driving the water trucks."
The 204th's quarry section and support staff spent a great deal of extra time training on the equipment and preparing the site; sometimes working three weekends a month.
"I think it's great," said Spc. James Burkee, a fuel handler for the 204th Engineer Battalion, peering down at the completed crusher and recalling the exhausting preparations he assisted in.
"This gives me the opportunity to cross-train and satisfaction knowing I am helping the community."
Although the crusher itself is incredible for it's capabilities and it's size, without the support from the community the project would not be possible.
"It's a community function.
It's not one sided- it's a group effort," said Corpin.
The CSWP was purchased from Cedarapids Inc. by TACOM (Tank Automotive 
Mr. David Schwartz, Assistant Program Manager at TACOM, provided invaluable logistical support.
Mr. Norb Sedlak and Mr. Ron Hamilton of Cedarapids Inc. provided the technical expertise and conducted all the training in the setup and operation of the crusher.

"This equipment will provide for everything from road and drainage work to concrete and sand production," Corbin said.

from the top: the 204th Engineers newest equipment, crusher, can produce nearly 150 tons of crushed rock The unit fielded the stone crusher at a quarry site in of Windsor, New York near the unit's armory.
Within the expansive 20-acre quarry, the $2.5 million stone crusher, together with the loading ramp, measures 390 feet long.
Aiming towards the sky, multiple conveyor belts stem from the main parts of the crusher like spider's legs, sending the finished products to specific stations.
The unit's use of the quarry was made possible through a lease agreement between the Division of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA) and the Town of Windsor, which was completed in March.
According to Michael Friess, the acting director of Facilities Management and Engineering at DMNA, the duration of the lease is for five years with the possibility of more five-year renewals.
While the agreement did not include any monetary transactions, it stated - with no particular amounts - that the town of Windsor gets use of the engineer's aggregate production.
"It's a trade off," said Staff Sgt.
Marc Robinson, the Quarry Foreman for the 204th Engineer Battalion.
"We are allowed to set up our equipment and train our soldiers and, in return, whatever we produce goes toward the town's
Currently, the town's crusher and washing system only has the ability to produce 40-tons of crushed stone per hour, whereas the 204th's new CSWP system can generate up to 150-tons in the same amount of time.
Twenty-three soldiers of the 204th's quarry section will work at the site on drill weekends and annual training.
Their production will save the town approximately $20,000 in sand and $30,000 in stone, according to Richard Kohlbach, Windsor's Highway Superintendent.
"I think it's going to be a real asset to the town," said Cheryl Peet, the town's highway department clerk.
"It will be a big savings for the tax payers."
As the town will benefit financially from the Guard's presence, the hands-on training soldiers receive will sharpen their military occupational skills (MOS).
Soldiers from the 204th Engineers make adjustments to the unit's Crushing/ Screening and Washing Plant (CSWP) at the Windsor Town Quarry.

Bringing Brad Home How Family Readiness Steps up for Families in Need Story and photo by Sgt.
Ray Drumsta 138th MPAD
FREDONIA hile Spc. Brad Mcniff was guarding his country, his 6-month old daughter Angelina became a casualty.
Twice.
And each time, the unit's Family Readiness Program responded to a soldier and family's needs.
Family Readiness, working with the Red Cross and his unit, got Brad home in 9 hours twice.
McNiff was deployed from his hometown of Fredonia, New York to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point with A Company, 1st Battalion, 127th Armor Regiment.
The battalion had mobilized one year ago for duty supporting Operation Noble Eagle II, with soldiers performing security missions across the Northeastern United States.
Earlier this year, Angelina's lungs collapsed from a combination of a viral infection and asthma.
The combination was a life-threatening condition which put her in the hospital in western New York.
Dawn Mcniff, Angelina's mother, contacted the company Family Readiness Group to bring McNiff home to assist with his daughter's medical care.
"If she didn't make it, I felt he should be there," Dawn said emotionally.
Sgt. 1st Class James Lemanski, the company Family Readiness Group Coordinator, contacted the Red Cross, who then contacted Brad through his chain of command at West Point.
W
"You had a woman who was distraught and didn't know what to do," said Lemanski.
"That's where Family Readiness comes in."
Dawn said she was "very happy" when Brad walked in to the hospital just hours from her call to the Family Readiness Group.
"I just smiled," she said.
Just 10 days after the first emergency, Angelina suffered a heart attack from an allergic reaction to her medication, and was airlifted to the hospital in a Mercy Flight Helicopter.
Again, Family Readiness Together again: Spc. Brad McNiff and his family pose outside the 1st Battalion, 127th Armor Regiment's A Company Armory in Dunkirk, following his recent homecoming.

Employers Urged To Support Reservists By Paul Purpura Courtesy of the New Orleans Times-Picayune With more than 207,900 part-time troops involved in the war on terrorism, two national military organizations have urged the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to lead the way toward changing how employers treat workers who are in the Reserves and National Guard.
ESGR (Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Committee) and Reserve Officers Association representatives said they hope that combining forces will give them a louder voice to push national issues, such as encouraging the U.S. Chamber to help make the lives of reservists and National Guard members easier when called to active duty.
That includes having companies make up the difference between military employees' civilian income and that provided by the military.
The ESGR helps employers understand federal labor laws that affect reservists and National Guard members when they are called to active duty.
Bob Hollingsworth, the ESGR's national executive director, said employers' main concern during mobilizations is that they get enough advance notice of when their military employees will be called away.
The Home Depot, a multi-billion corporation headquartered in Cobb County, is doing more than its share to support America's National Guardsmen and Reservists who have left their jobs to answer their country's call to arms.
Home Depot President and CEO Bob Nardelli signed a Statement of Support for the Guard and Reserve, allowing all Home Depot employees either mobilized or on active duty to continue receiving their full salary, health insurance and retirement benefits for six months.
Home Depot Public Relations Manager Goldie Taylor said the employees still receive a paycheck from the National Guard, but if the check falls short of what they would have received from Home Depot, the multi-billion dollar corporation will make up the difference.
Nardelli said Home Depot is not required by federal law to offer this compensation.
"We feel it is our civic duty," he said.
"We owe our Reservists and Guardsmen a debt of gratitude, and we want to send them a message that their job is secure at Home Depot while they are serving abroad."
Medical care for your baby is paid as part of your maternity care for the first 3 days.
After 3 days, the baby could begin separate cost-sharing as an individual at the normal rate.
Under maternity care, well-baby and well-child care are extended benefits for children from birth up to age 6, when services are provided by the attending pediatrician, certified nurse practitioner, or certified physician assistant.
Some of the extended benefits include routine newborn care, health supervision examinations, routine immunizations, periodic health screening, and developmental assessment in accordance with American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.
For more information, please visit Chapter 10 "What's Covered - Maternity Care" in the TRICARE Handbook: http://www.tricare.osd.mil/tricarehandbook
Some TRICARE Facts...
Â·Dependent parents and parents-in-law are not eligible for TRICARE benefits.
However, they are eligible for care in a military treatment facility on a space-available basis (and if available, under TRICARE Plus), and may be eligible for TRICARE Senior Pharmacy benefits.
Â·Beneficiaries must appear in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) database as eligible for TRICARE benefits, or TRICARE Standard will deny those claims.
Â·To use TRICARE benefits, beneficiaries must have a valid identification (ID) card issued by the uniformed services and be in the DEERS database.
The back of the ID card indicates eligibility for medical care from military or civilian sources in the "Medical" block.
Normally, children under 10 years of age can use either parent or guardian's
ID card, but must be enrolled in DEERS.
The child's sponsor should obtain an ID card for the child after age 10.
TRICARE Little Known Facts: Maternity Care If you become pregnant, TRICARE helps pay for the maternity care you will need.
This covers pregnancy, delivery, and up to 6 weeks of newborn care.
If an active duty member is discharged while his wife is pregnant, TRICARE does not cover any maternity care after the day of discharge from the military unless the family qualifies for the Transitional Assistance Management Program or has enrolled in the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP), which extends eligibility for health care benefits similar to TRICARE Standard for a certain period after TRICARE eligibility ends.

Tips for Mailing Packages and Letters Overseas
Letters, Small Packages Get to Troops Quicker
Mail to Iraq or Afghanistan spends "a couple of days" in the U.S. Postal Service system before it reaches either San Francisco or New York City, said Military Postal Service Agency official, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Brian Lomax.
Then it travels another 16 to 19 hours by plane before landing in Kuwait or Bahrain, where it's delivered by motor vehicle.
Once in theater, a letter takes 7 to 14 days to reach the service member, while a package usually takes 14 to 24 days.
"The size of the package plays an important role," Lomax said.
"Large packages take up a lot more room.
If there's a choice between taking one large box or a lot of smaller boxes and letters, the large box will stay (at the mail facility).
The ideal size is a shoebox.
It's also important to correctly address the package."
National Guard Key To the Army Its Role Is Increasing As Soldiers Are Deployed More Frequently When you hear of National Guardsmen, do you know who they are? Yes, they are soldiers, but how do they fit into the overall U.S. military structure? It may be easiest to think of the National Guard as part-time soldiers.
In peacetime, they train one weekend a month and two weeks a year.
When they are activated, they train and serve full time.
The modern National Guard is part of a massive reserve system that augments the full-time active armed forces.
Forty percent of today's armed forces are in the National Guard, and the Guard and its predecessors have participated in every war since the Pequot War in Massachusetts in 1637.
Particularly in recent times, the Guard has been essential to the nation's defense as the number of soldiers in the regular armed forces decreased.
The Guard's soldiers are deployed more frequently and serve longer tours.
The Guard is unique among the seven divisions of the reserve system because it is under the command of the state and federal government.
In times of peace, governors have command over their respective state's Guard, and they have authority to call them into service during natural disasters, such as blizzards, tornadoes or floods, and for help during civil unrest.

A Salute to Our Military Families Commentary from Duane B. Fish Chief Warrant Officer (retired) Korea 
200,000 Parents Receive Air Force Pins By Master Sgt.
Scott Elliott Air Force Print News
WASHINGTON, DC our Guardians of Freedom, the Air Force's grassroots outreach information and recognition pro gram, has touched the lives of more than 200,000 parents of airmen, Pentagon officials announced August 8th.
The program began in 2002 as a way for Air Force leaders to recognize employers of reservists and guardsmen who were called to active duty.
Employers nominated by airmen employees received lapel pins emblazoned with the Air Force logo and the letter "E," and a personal letter signed by the Air Force's senior leaders.
The recognition program expanded in May to include parents.
Nominated parents received a letter and lapel pin with the letter "P."
All active-duty, Air National Guard and Reserve airmen may participate in the program.
About 110,000 of the nearly 590,000 uniformed airmen have nominated their parents for recognition, according to Brig. Gen. Ed Tonini, program director.
"That's a huge number," he said.
"We've gotten an exceptional reaction to the program from the individual airmen and incredibly emotional responses from their parents when they've received their letters and pins."
Even though I am now long since home from an overseas deployment, I still cry when I see military families reunited on the news.
I remember how I felt each time.
For those of you going through deployments right now, keep the faith and know that you will get through this.
We are a different breed apart, aren't we? Thank God for our soldiers and their family members and loved ones that support them.
We really do live in the greatest nation on Earth.
Y
The pins are about three-fourths of an inch square and feature a silver letter "P" cradled within the Air Force symbol.
Airmen may request up to two parent pins and letters to be sent to either their parents or people they view as parental figures, Tonini said.
"Everyone has someone they want to recognize," he said.
A personalized letter to the parents from Secretary of the Air Force Dr. James G. Roche and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. John P. Jumper will accompany the pins.
"We could not protect America's freedom without the incredible people who are willing to carry on the Air Force tradition," the letter reads.
"As the proud parents of one of those airmen, your support continues to be critical to our ongoing efforts and makes a real difference to our country."

GuardHELP 2003: Engineers Tour State with Community Projects Guard Times Staff
BINGHAMTON
M
embers of the 204th Engineer Battalion, with headquarters here in New York's Southern Tier, conducted statewide missions of community support this summer as part of the New York National Guard's GuardHELP initiative.
In the central New York town of Minekill, engineers from the A Company Horizontal Platoon leveled a large expanse of the state park to grade for a soccer field.
Soldiers brought dozers, scrapers and excavators to the site to perform the project.
In the City of Cohoes, troops cleared away debris from the Erie Canal's Locks Nine and Fifteen.
The two sites, long since abandoned and in disrepair, will be restored as historical sites thanks to the members of the 204th Engineers.
"Years of neglect and exposure to the elements have degraded the lock sites to a condition not suitable for such an American Treasure.
With the help of our National Guard Engineers, the locks will be returned to a state that preserves the greatest engineering marvel of the 19th Century," said Cohoes Mayor John T. McDonald.
In Central New York's Madison County, Guard troops deployed to upgrade a stretch of public trails between Lincoln and Cazenovia.
More than 20 guardsmen and women and a fleet of graders, backhoes, dump trucks and other machines arrived Aug. 16 to restored culverts, installed new French drains and graded certain parts of what used to be a washed-out path.
"The community is the beneficiary," said local North Country

"When they (the Guard) put this team together, it took only a few days to meld into a perfect work force."
The Madison County Link Trail connects to the 390-mile Finger Lakes Trail.
The North Country Trail Association is building a 4,200-mile trail from the New York-Vermont border to North Dakota, and is approaching 50 percent of that goal.
Much of the trail conversion is based on existing, but abandoned rail lines.
"This is a perfect example of rails to trails," said Edward Heinrich, regional director of the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

Sailor Supports Living History Guard Times Staff
BOSTON
hile many Americans celebrated the Fourth of July holiday at home with families, Naval Militia member Petty Officer 2nd Class Joseph Palumbo was working to help preserve history.
Palumbo, from Massapequa Long Island served on board the USS Constitution in Boston's Charlestown Navy Yard.
The Constitution is an historical Navy vessel and is the nation's oldest commissioned warship still afloat.
Palumbo served on the Constitution during the ship's annual sailing in Boston Harbor where the ship fires a 21-gun salute to the nation before returning to port.
The activation for the security mission was a rare and unique chance for a Naval Reserve sailor to serve on the historic vessel.
"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be here in this historic site right next to the Petty Officer Joseph Palumbo on duty at the USS Constitution.

Constitution," Palumbo said during his tour of duty.
"Never in my life would I have imagined that some day I would be attached to such an historic ship," he said.
Cleland began his military career over forty years ago, as a fresh faced Marine Corps boot recruit.
He has served in the New York Guard since 1988, and was named commander in June of 2002.
Since taking over the command of the New York Guard, Cleland embarked on an aggressive program of change: raising standards and inspiring professionalism throughout the ranks.
"Thomas Cleland has brought about within the New York Guard a revitalization," Maguire said.
"I want to thank General Maguire for his support for the program we initiated just about a year ago," Cleland said.
"Things (in the NYG) are changing in a very major way."
Looking ahead, Cleland cited the importance of enlisted personnel to the New York Guard's future.
"It takes a special person to be in the New York Guard.
You have to have a desire to serve.
I expect to see the New York Guard in the next three years grow substantially from where we are now," he said.
"That can't happen without talented, committed enlisted personnel.
I am a former Marine, I'm very proud of that.
But, I have to tell you, I am just as proud to be able to work with the men and women volunteers of the New York Guard.
They are just very special, exceptional individuals."

n late July, the 900 Marines of the 2nd Battalion of the 25th Marine Regiment (2/25) handed over control of military operations in their area here to a 3,000-soldier Italian brigade under British command.
The ceremony marked the end of the Marine Reservists mission in Iraq.
"With support from the (15th) Marine Expeditionary Unit, 2/25 as a battalion has been able to effectively complete several missions," said Maj. Tom P. Adissi, the battalion logistics officer prior to departing from staging areas in Kuwait.
"The Marines are glad to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom and are really proud to help the war-torn city of An Nasiriyah get back to being a stable community."

We helped in that wherever we could."
The battalion also guarded the bridges that lead into the city.
As long as the battalion controled the routes leading into An Nasiriyah, they kept any opposing forces from interrupting the rebuilding efforts inside the city.
"Our line companies guarded the bridges," said Gunnery Sgt. Joseph F. Yuditsky, battalion logistics chief.
"We tried
to keep any potentially hostile individuals from coming into the city where we were trying to help the Iraqis."
The unit scheduled homecoming ceremonies across the Reserve Centers in New York State in early August.
The remaining 100 Marines of the battalion redeployed later that month.

Commentary: 9-11 Widow Supports Troops By Christy Ferer Courtesy of the Army News Service When I told friends about my pilgrimage to Iraq to thank the troops, their reactions were underwhelming at best.
Some were blunt.
"Why are you going there?" They could not understand why it was important for me, a widow of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, to express my support for the men and women stationed in the Gulf today.
But the reason seemed clear to me.
Two hundred thousand troops have been sent halfway around the world to stabilize a culture that breeds terrorists like those who I believe began World War III on Sept. 11, 2001.
Reaction at home was so politely negative I began to doubt my role on the first USO Tribeca Institute tour into newly occupied Iraq where, on average, a soldier a day is killed.
Besides, with Robert De Niro, Kid Rock, Rebecca and John Stamos, Wayne Newton, Gary Senise and Lee Ann Womack, who needed me?

Armed with M16s and saddlebags of water in 120-degree heat, the soldiers swarmed over the stars for photos and autographs.
When they heard a trio of Sept. 11 family members was also in the tent, it was as if a psychic cork on emotional dam was popped.
Soldiers from every corner of New York, Long Island and Queens rushed toward us to express their condolences.
Some wanted to touch us, as if they needed a physical connection to our sorrow and for some living proof for why they were there.
One mother of two from Montana told me she signed up because of the terrorist attacks.
Dozens of others told us the same thing.
One young soldier showed me his metal bracelet engraved with the name of a victim he never knew and that awful date none of us will ever forget.
In fact, at every encounter with the troops came a surge of Guardsmen and reservists -- firefighters and cops, including many who had worked the rubble of Ground Zero -- just to exchange a hometown hug.
Their glassy eyes still do not allow anyone to penetrate too far inside to the place where their trauma is lodged; the trauma of devastation far greater than anyone who hadn't been there could even imagine.

I had forced my way downtown on that awful morning, convinced I could find Neil beneath the rubble.

Soldier Wounded in Iraq Donates Combat Boots to Military Museum Guard Times Staff
FORT HAMILTON overnor George E. Pataki honored US Army Sgt. Curtis Campbell of Brooklyn with the presentation of the New York State Conspicuous Service Cross on July 31st for his actions on the battlefields of Iraq.
Sergeant Campbell was wounded in a convoy ambush that claimed the lives of eleven US soldiers and saw seven others, including Pfc. Jessica Lynch, taken prisoner.
Campbell -- a member of the 507th Maintenance Company out of Ft. Bliss, Texas - had requested an opportunity to meet the Governor upon his return home to New York.
"Sergeant Curtis Campbell is not only a native New Yorker, he's also a bone fide American Hero," Governor Pataki said.
"Sergeant Campbell risked his life to defend freedom, and all New Yorkers can be extremely proud of his tremendous courage and sacrifice."
After Governor Pataki presented Sergeant Campbell with the Conspicuous Service Cross, the Sergeant presented the Governor with the boots that he wore while on active duty overseas.
The pair of combat boots will become the first Operation Iraqi Freedom-related object in the collection of the New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center, established in Saratoga Springs by Governor Pataki in October of 2002.

"As a native of Brooklyn, New York, this recognition carries a very special meaning for me," Campbell said.
"I am also grateful to have the opportunity to present Governor Pataki with the pair of boots I wore while on duty overseas in Iraq for the State's Military Museum and Veterans Research Center.
"I hope they serve as a reminder for future visitors of the bravery and the sacrifices all of our nation's servicemen and women have made to defend freedom," he said.

BINGHAMTON inghamton General Hospital was recognized this summer for its support of employees who also serve in the Guard and Reserve.
The hospital was awarded the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve's (ESGR) Committee State Chair's Award for supporting Guard and Reserve members during recent federal mobilizations supporting the global war on terror in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.
The award was made at the recommendation by 1st Lt. Frank R. Rodriguez.
He is a nurse in the intensive care unit at Binghamton General Hospital.
He recently served on active duty in southwest Asia.
Peter V. McGinn, PhD, President and CEO of United Health Services accepted the award at the hospital on July 14.

Also present was Frank O'Connor, Director of Marketing for the State's ESGR Committee and vice president of Messenger Associates, Inc.
The National ESGR Committee sponsors an awards program designed to recognize employers for employment policies and practices that are supportive of their employees' participation in the National Guard and Reserve.
Puglisi said, "This award is but a token of thanks to the staff and administration at United Health Services.
This level of support is critical to the morale of those who are activated and who are leaving their families and communities.
Knowing that their job will be there when they return can provide some comfort to the activated troops."
"When troops are activated, they leave their family, their homes and jobs.
And to have the support from their employers is important to them.
United Health Services serves as an example for other employers when their employees are activated," O'Connor concluded.

Commissary Web Site is Customer Link to Savings By Bonnie Powell Courtesy of the Family Readiness Program hen is the next case lot sale? What time does my commissary open? Where can I get more cou pons? The answers to those questions, and more, are at www.commissaries.com.
Commissary customers will find their one-stop cyber information center is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year - and there is always something new.
"The Web site is there to help them save money," said Rick Brink, Web content editor for the Defense Commissary Agency.
"One thing we're often asked is why there aren't Internet coupons on our site.
But there are.
We may not be able to offer them ourselves, but customers can find links to commercial sites that offer commissary sales information, newsletters and downloadable coupons through the links page at www.commissaries.com."
The number of coupons redeemed online or downloaded and used at "brick and mortar stores" has increased dramatically over the last three years, with grocery coupons among the most popular.
For example, a link to CoolSavings, one of the largest providers of coupons on the Internet, is brand new on the links page available at the web site.
"If a business sells groceries in commissaries or has coupons of interest to our customers, all they need to do is provide a gateway page for commissary customers and we'll provide a text link to their Web site," says Brink.
"We want to do anything we can to encourage savings above and beyond the 30 percent savings we typically provide commissary shoppers."
"Store pages are the most visited areas of our Web site by far," said Brink.
"Customers can find commissary locations, hours, news about store events and other useful information about their commissary.
They can even e-mail the store.
It's all right there at their fingertips - all they have to do is click."
Customers can also access the shopping pages before they plan their commissary trips to find out what's on sale.
Another recent addition is a link to the "Commissary Gift Certificates" page, which allows anyone to purchase the certificates as a "gift of groceries" for military families and friends or to donate to charities that support the military.
The gift certificates page has become the top-ranked specialty page with over $1 million commissary gift certificates purchased or donated since October 2002.

"I love Watkins Glen.
"I love road racing and Watkins Glen is an awesome place to race.
To come here and have all family and friends, hometown, it's just awesome," Bodine said.
Unfortunately, the Guard car experienced difficulties, forcing Bodine off the track with 25 laps remaining and into 35th place in the race.

VA Reduces SGLI Premiums for Military and Family Coverage Sgt. 1st Class Doug Sample American Forces Press Service
WASHINGTON, DC
T
he Department of Veterans Affairs has announced that premiums for the Service members Group Life Insurance will be reduced, handing military members a few extra dollars in their pockets each month.
Beginning in July, the cost for a $250,000 policy -- the maximum coverage -- dropped from $20 to $16.25 monthly, a $3.75 savings.
Rates for Veterans Group Life Insurance will not change.
Tom Tower, DoD's assistant director for military compensation, welcomed the reduced premiums, adding that anytime you put "more money in the pockets of military members, it's always a good result."
Premiums will also be reduced for SGLI family coverage, with rates varying among age groups.
The largest saving will go to spouses between 35 and 39 years old, whose premiums will be nearly cut in half.
Service members currently pay $13.00 for a $100,000 family policy.
That policy will cost $7.50 beginning in July Â­ a $5.50 savings.
The reduced rates means a military family will save an average of $100 a year.
The VA estimates that service members collectively will save about $96 million annually in premiums, and $42 million in family coverage premiums each year.
Tower said the reduced premiums are a result of an ongoing process to keep costs down for military members.
"The VA regularly checks to see how much is paid out versus how much is collected in premiums, and whenever it seems like they have built up premium reserves, they like to reduce premiums to keep the cost to a minimum for the
member," Tower said.
"Its part of the objective of the program: to provide the lowest cost possible."
SGLI began in 1965 to meet the insurance needs of Vietnam- era service members.
Before SGLI, the military provided $10,000 policies to service members, and policies were available to active-duty military only.
Today the SGLI program provides coverage of $250,000 to active duty service members and most Reservists.
Coverage of $100,000 has also been provided for spouses of participating members with free coverage of $10,000 for dependent children.
Reduced levels of coverage may also be elected.
Information about the change in SGLI premiums can be found at www.insurance.va.gov, or call the Office of Servicemembers Group Life Insurance toll-free at 1-800419- 1473.
