and the licensee's physician.
The board may grant waivers of the minimum continuing education requirements for physical disability or illness for any period of time not to exceed one renewal period.
In the event that the physical disability or illness upon which a waiver has been granted continues beyond the period of the waiver, the licensee must reapply for an extension of the waiver.
