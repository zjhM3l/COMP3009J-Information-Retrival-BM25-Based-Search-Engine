CHAPTER 2 THE SECTION 106 REVIEW PROCESS 2-1 CHAPTER 2 THE SECTION 106 REVIEW PROCESS 2.0 OVERVIEW This Handbook chapter addresses applicable requirements set forth in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (as amended).
Section 106 pertains to actions performed, assisted, permitted, or licensed by a federal agency that may affect historic properties.
In regard to most transportation projects in Florida, this is generally the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acting in concert with its agent, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT).
Although this discussion is in terms of federal involvement, these actions apply to all levels of projects proposed by the FDOT because state laws and Florida's historic preservation compliance review program parallel the federal process for Section 106 review.
In the case of transportation projects, the four-step Section 106 process is initiated (Step 1) by the FHWA determining whether it has an undertaking that is a type of action that could affect historic properties.
If not, the FHWA has no further obligations under Section 106.
If potential effects may result, the FHWA identifies the proper parties with which to consult in the Section 106 process concerning the action.
The FHWA then determines the appropriate scope of the resource identification process for the action and proceeds to identify (Step 2) potentially affected historic properties.
If significant historic properties, i.e., those eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), are identified in the project's Area of Potential Effect, FHWA, in consultation with appropriate parties, makes an assessment of adverse effect on the significant historic resources (Step 3).
If no adverse effects are identified the project may proceed.
If adverse effects are identified the agency begins consultation to resolve these adverse effects (Step 4) by their avoidance, minimization, or mitigation.
Consultation may result in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) among consulting parties; the MOA outlines the measures to be taken to resolve the adverse effects.
Occasionally, there is no way to resolve the adverse effects of an undertaking and the effects must be accepted in the public interest.
The transportation undertaking then proceeds.
This chapter presents a simplified description of the Section 106 process as implemented by 36 CFR Part 800 (revised, 1/11/01).
SECTION 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 CONTENTS Introduction to Section 106 of the NHPA FHWA and the Section 106 Process State Review and Section 106 Other Participants in the Section 106 Process Implementing Section 106: The Four Steps Featured Hyperlinks PAGE 2-3 2-4 2-4 2-4 2-6 2-13 2-2 2.1 INTRODUCTION TO SECTION 106 OF THE NHPA The Section 106 process is a review procedure established by Congress in 1966.
The procedures for this process are contained in Title 36 CFR Part 800 ("Protection of Historic Properties"), revised January 11, 2001.
Section 106 represents the principal federal review process that looks at how historic properties are affected by projects funded by or under the jurisdiction of federal agencies.
It is the statutory responsibility of the federal agency to fulfill the requirements of the Section 106 process and to ensure that an agency official with jurisdiction over an undertaking takes legal and financial responsibility for Section 106 compliance (36 CFR Part 800.2).
Federal agencies under the U.S. Department of Transportation that may be involved in Section 106 actions include the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and the Federal Railroad Administration.
Other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Corps of Engineers, may be involved in the Section 106 process involving transportation projects through the permitting functions of the agency.
In the case of most transportation projects, the FDOT is primarily involved with the FHWA as the "involved federal agency" in terms Department activities and acts as the agent of the FHWA in such undertakings.
The FHWA is thus designated as the coordinating agency in the Section 106 process throughout this Cultural Resource Management Handbook.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended) states that: The head of any federal agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed federal or federally-assisted undertaking in any state and the head of any federal department or independent agency having authority to license any undertaking shall, prior to the approval of the expenditure of any federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license, as the case may be, take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
The head of any such federal agency shall afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation established under Title II of this Act a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.
In essence, Section 106 requires federal agencies to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Consider the effects their actions (or actions they may assist, permit, or license) may have on NRHP-listed or eligible historic properties Provide the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) a reasonable opportunity to comment on such actions The main purpose of Section 106 is to avoid, minimize, or mitigate impacts to significant historic properties resulting from federal actions.
Technically, Section 106 applies to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Properties that have been formally listed in the NRHP Properties that have been determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP Properties that may be eligible but have not yet been identified and evaluated 2-3 The latter is critical to FHWA and FDOT since it is the responsibility of the federal agency involved to identify historic properties and ascertain their potential NRHP eligibility following the procedures outlined in the Advisory Council and National Park Service regulations, 36 CFR Part 800.
The underlying philosophy behind Section 106 maintains that the optimal environment will possess a harmonious mix of old and new cultural resources.
Section 106 also recognizes that it is not realistic, nor in the public interest, to preserve every historic resource.
Therefore, Section 106 does not require preservation in every case, nor does it give the ACHP veto power over a federal agency's actions.
It does, however, require full consideration of preservation values by federal agencies compared with the projected benefits of the completed undertaking, costs, and other factors.
As a result, final actions performed by federal agencies and reviewed by the Section 106 process can range from avoidance to unmitigated loss of the historic property, as long as consideration of the effects and available options were carefully evaluated.
2.2 FHWA AND THE SECTION 106 PROCESS As a federal agency, FHWA is the lead agency and directly involved with the Section 106 review process.
In turn, FDOT also participates in the Section 106 review process as the agent of the FHWA.
Although policies and procedures change, the FDOT facilitates the 106 process by providing FHWA with the appropriate documentation and assistance at each step.
This documentation includes, but is not limited to, Cultural Resource Assessment Surveys (CRASs), Section 106 Consultation Case Reports, and Agreement Documents such as Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) or Programmatic Agreements (PAs).
Additional assistance includes, but is not limited to, gathering of required information and documents, coordination of the Section 106 process, and participation in consultation meetings.
2.3 STATE REVIEW AND SECTION 106 For state-funded transportation projects with no federal funding or assistance, the provisions in Chapter 267, F.S., which mirror the NHPA Section 106 requirements, apply.
In the case of state-funded projects, the lead agency is the FDOT.
Section 106 has been incorporated as part of Florida's uniform historic preservation program.
As noted in the DHR's program guidelines, this unified federal-state process avoids confusion.
Florida's comprehensive historic preservation statutory framework complements that of the federal government.
In many respects, Chapter 267, F.S. parallels the provisions of the federal NHPA of 1966 (as amended).
2.4 OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE SECTION 106 PROCESS In addition to FHWA and the Department, the revised Section 106 regulations (36 CFR Part 800.2(a)(4)) state that FHWA shall involve certain consulting parties in the findings and determinations made during the process.
Such consultations should be appropriate to the scale of 2-4 the undertaking and the scope of federal involvement.
Where applicable, this consultation process should be coordinated with agency procedures and mechanisms established to meet the requirements of other statutes such as those of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other regulatory legislation.
The consultation process involves seeking, discussing, and considering the views of other participants, and, where feasible, seeking agreement with them in matters arising in the Section 106 process (36 CFR Part 800.16(f)).
Consulting parties in the Section 106 process include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) The Division of Historical Resources (DHR), of the Department of State, is Florida's primary historic preservation agency.
The office of the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) is established in DHR.
The SHPO is appointed by the Governor and serves at the pleasure of the Secretary of State.
The SHPO conducts relations with the representatives of the federal government and with respective states concerning matters of historic preservation.
The Historic Preservation Compliance Review Section of DHR is responsible for reviewing and commenting on historic preservation work conducted under Section 106 and Chapter 267 F.S. (revised 2001).
The SHPO reflects the interests of the state and its citizens in the preservation of their cultural heritage.
The SHPO advises and assists federal agencies in carrying out their Section 106 responsibilities and cooperates with such agencies, local governments, organizations and individuals to ensure that historic properties are taken into consideration at all levels of planning and development (36 CFR Part 800.2 [c][1]
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) Native American coordination, where applicable, is an important FHWA responsibility in the Section 106 process.
The THPO is the tribal official appointed by a federally recognized tribe's chief governing body or designated by tribal ordinance or preservation program who has assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for purposes of Section 106 compliance on tribal lands.
Tribal lands refer to lands within the boundaries of any Indian reservation and all dependent Indian communities.
A tribal historic preservation representative may be consulted if a THPO has not been officially appointed and certified.
In the latter case, the SHPO will also be a consulting party concerning resources on tribal lands.
The THPO or an appointed historic preservation representative should also be consulted concerning historic properties of interest to a tribe that are located off tribal lands.
Again, the SHPO also participates as a consulting party in such cases.
The FHWA must ensure, where applicable, that federally recognized Native American tribes have a reasonable opportunity to identify concerns, including those of traditional and cultural significance known as "Traditional Cultural Properties," about significant cultural resources in all steps of the Section 106 process.
It is FHWA's responsibility to make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify the appropriate tribes to be consulted.
Furthermore, the need for confidentiality under certain circumstances should be recognized as an essential part of the consultation process.
Finally, consultation with a Native American tribe must recognize the "government-togovernment" relationship that exists between the federal government and federally recognized 2-5 Native American tribes and should be conducted in a sensitive manner that is respectful of tribal sovereignty.
For additional information, see Exhibit 2-1.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Advisory Council On Historic Preservation (ACHP) The ACHP provides guidance and assistance in the consultation process and generally oversees the operation of the Section 106 process.
The Council also consults with and comments to agency officials on individual undertakings and programs that affect historic properties.
It may enter the process of its own accord to ensure adherence to proper policy and procedure or in response to a request from a participating party to provide advice, guidance, and assistance concerning a specific undertaking including functioning in dispute resolution.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Representatives of Local Governments A representative of a local government with jurisdiction over the area in which the effects of an undertaking may occur is entitled to participate as a consulting party.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Public The views of the public (36 CFR Part 800.2[d]) are considered essential to informed decision-making in the Section 106 process.
FHWA shall seek and consider the views of the public in a manner commensurate with the nature and complexity of an undertaking and its potential effects on historic properties.
As in Native American coordination, confidentiality should be a consideration in certain circumstances.
FHWA must, except where confidentiality is to be protected, provide the public with information about an undertaking and seek public comment and input.
Where possible, FHWA may use the public involvement process associated with other regulatory requirements to fulfill its responsibility in this area if they are adequate to do so.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Additional Consulting Parties Certain individuals and organizations with a demonstrated interest in an undertaking may participate as consulting parties in the Section 106 process (36 CFR Part 800.2[c][5]
2.5 IMPLEMENTING SECTION 106 - THE FOUR STEPS The Section 106 process is briefly described in the following sections.
For federally funded or assisted undertakings, the FHWA is ultimately responsible for completing the process and for coordination and consultation with the SHPO, the THPO or other appropriate tribal representative, if applicable, and the ACHP.
As noted above, other consulting parties include representatives of local governments and the public.
FDOT's responsibility is to provide FHWA with the appropriate documentation and assistance at each step in the Section 106 process.
For state-funded projects, 2-6 the Department takes the responsibility for complying with the provisions of state historic preservation law with no FHWA involvement.
The revised regulations (36 CFR Part 800), effective January 11, 2001, strengthen certain requirements of the Section 106 process and also attempt to "streamline" portions of the review.
Consultation between the federal agency and other parties with an interest in the effects of an undertaking is stressed.
Increased consultation with federally recognized Native American Tribes is emphasized especially in cases where the action occurs on tribal lands or involves resources of cultural or religious significance to a tribe on or off tribal lands.
The revised regulations recommend commencing the review process at the early stages of project planning.
The review process, which implements Section 106, is divided into four steps and is illustrated in the flow chart below: Step Step Step Step 1: 2: 3: 4: Initiate the Section 106 Process Identify Historic Properties Assess Adverse Effects Resolve Adverse Effects Initiate Section 106 Process Establish undertaking Identify appropriate SHPO/THPO Plan to involve the public Identify other consulting parties Undertaking is type that might affect historic properties Identify Historic Properties No undertaking/no potential to cause effects Determine scope of efforts Identify historic properties Evaluate historic significance Historic properties are affected Assess Adverse Effects No historic properties affected Apply criteria of adverse effect Historic properties are adversely affected Resolve Adverse Effects No historic properties adversely affected Continue consultation FAILURE TO AGREE Memorandum of Agreement COUNCIL COMMENT 2-7 2.5.1 Step 1: Initiate the Section 106 Process The FHWA first determines whether the proposed action is an "undertaking" as defined in the Section 106 regulations and, if so, whether it is the type of activity that has the potential to cause effects on historic properties.
As noted in Chapter 1 of this Handbook, historic properties are significant cultural resources, that is, those that meet the criteria for inclusion in the NRHP.
An "undertaking" is defined in 36 CFR Part 800.16(y) as follows: "a project, activity, or program funded in whole or part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a federal agency, including those carried out by or on behalf of a federal agency; those carried out with federal financial assistance; those requiring a federal permit, license or approval; and those subject to state or local regulations administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a federal agency."
If the undertaking is concluded to be a type of activity that does not have the potential to affect historic properties, if they were indeed present, then the agency has no further obligations under Section 106.
This decision is unilaterally made by FHWA but the ACHP may issue an advisory opinion on the validity of this decision.
If the undertaking is determined to have the potential to affect historic properties, assuming that such resources were present, the FHWA must identify the appropriate SHPO and/or THPO (see 2.4) to consult in the Section 106 process.
FHWA then consults with the SHPO/THPO to identify other potential consulting parties (36 CFR Part 800.3) concerning the proposed action and is responsible for inviting them to participate.
This consultation process with the SHPO/THPO also includes developing a plan to involve the public in the Section 106 process by identifying the appropriate points to seek public input and for notifying the public of proposed actions.
Where practicable, existing agency public involvement procedures can be used in this process if they are adequate in assuring compliance with Section 106 requirements.
So too, is coordinating the Section 106 review with reviews required under other authorities such as NEPA.
The public outreach effort should reflect the nature and complexity of the undertaking, the potential effects involved, and the projected public interest in the project.
Confidentiality should also be considered in cases where resources may be threatened by public disclosure.
This is especially the case where resources considered of religious or cultural significance to Native American tribes are involved.
FHWA should consult with the SHPO/THPO in a manner appropriate for the agency planning process for the undertaking and to the nature of the undertaking and its effects on historic properties (36 CFR Part 800.3[c][3]
In other words, it is important that FHWA involve other participating parties in the Section 106 process in the project planning process and that the required consultation should be commensurate with the characteristics of the undertaking and its projected potential to affect historic properties.
Policies and procedures pertinent to these issues can be found in the FDOT Project Development and Environment Manual (PD
2-8 Once the determination has been made that the undertaking has the potential to affect historic properties, if present, and the consultation process has been initiated, the second step in the Section 106 process is implemented (see flow chart on page 2-7).
2.5.2 Step 2: Identify Historic Properties This step in the Section 106 process occurs when a determination has been made that the undertaking may have the potential to affect historic properties, that is, significant archaeological and/or historical cultural resources.
It involves FHWA and its agent, the FDOT, in determining the scope of the resource identification effort, conducting a cultural resource assessment survey tailored to the magnitude of the project and its potential for effects on historic properties, and in evaluating the significance of any cultural resources identified in the assessment process.
If it is determined that the proposed project could affect historic properties, FHWA, in consultation with the SHPO and/or THPO, determine and document the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the undertaking.
The APE is the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties (36 CFR Part 800.16[d]), that is, affect the qualities for which the resource has been determined significant according to the National Register criteria.
Once again, the nature and magnitude of the undertaking and its concomitant potential to cause effects is a critical element in the determination of the APE.
The scoping process of the resource identification effort involves, as applicable, a review of existing historic properties within the APE including any data concerning possible historic properties not yet identified.
Information is sought from consulting parties identified in Step 1 and, as appropriate, from any other individuals or organizations that are likely to have knowledge concerning cultural resources in the area.
The gathering of such information includes consultation as noted above, background research involving prior studies, oral history interviews where appropriate, and sample field investigation where necessary.
At this stage, it is also important to gather information from appropriate federally recognized Native American tribes concerning archaeological resources that may be of religious or cultural significance to them on or off tribal lands.
When appropriate, confidentially issues should be considered (36 CFR Part 800.11[c]) to protect any historic properties that may be identified.
Based on the background information gathered, and in consultation with participating parties, a cultural resource assessment survey (CRAS) is conducted appropriate to the nature of the undertaking and its potential effects.
Part 2, Chapter 12 of the FDOT Project Development and Environment Manual discusses level of survey in regard to various undertakings.
The cultural resource assessment survey process and its proper documentation are discussed in detail in Chapters 3 and 5 of this Handbook.
Where project alternatives consist of corridors or involve large land areas, or where access to property is restricted, FHWA may use a phased process to conduct identification and evaluation efforts.
If cultural resources, archaeological or historical are identified within the APE as a result of the CRAS, they are evaluated for significance according to National Register criteria.
The evaluation process for cultural resources is discussed in detail in Chapter 4 of this Handbook.
If FHWA and the consulting parties agree on the potential significance of a resource or resources encountered, then the evaluation process is complete.
If the participating parties do not agree, than the Keeper of the National Register may be requested to make a determination of 2-9 National Register eligibility for the resource (see 36 CFR Part 63).
A participant in the Section 106 process may also request that the ACHP become involved in this determination effort.
Two possible findings are possible as a result of Step 2 in the Section 106 process.
If the FHWA finds that there are no historic properties present or that there are historic properties present but that the undertaking will have no effect on them, a finding of "No Historic Properties Affected" is issued (see flow chart on page 2-7).
This finding is fully documented to the SHPO/ THPO according to documentation requirements listed in 36 CFR Part 800.11(d).
All consulting parties are notified and documentation is made available for public inspection prior to approving the undertaking.
If the SHPO/THPO or ACHP, if it has entered the process, does not object to the finding within 30 days of the receipt of the finding, the FHWA's obligations under Section 106 are fulfilled.
If the FHWA determines that there are historic properties that may be affected by the undertaking then a "Historic Properties Affected" finding results and Step 3 of the Section 106 process is initiated (see flow chart on page 2-7).
This is also the case if the SHPO/THPO or ACHP, if involved, object to the finding of "No Historic Properties Affected."
In this instance, the FHWA shall notify all consulting parties and invite their views on the effects and proceed to assess adverse effects in Step 3 of the Section 106 process.
2.5.3 Step 3: Assess Adverse Effects If historic properties are determined to be potentially affected in the APE, FHWA applies the Criteria of Adverse Effect to these resources.
In doing so, FHWA considers any views concerning such effects that have been provided by consulting parties and the public.
An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a resource that qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
Adverse effects are those that would diminish the integrity of the properties location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling or association.
Adverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be further removed in distance, or be cumulative (36 CFR Part 800.5[a]).
Adverse effects can range from physical destruction or damage to all or part of the property by the undertaking to the improper provision of handicapped access that is not consistent with The Secretary of the Interior 's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (36 CFR Part 68) and applicable guidelines.
The Criteria of Adverse Effect are fully described and discussed in Chapter 6 of this Handbook.
It is important to note that former "exceptions" to the Criteria of Adverse Effect determination have been eliminated in the new Section 106 process (revised, 1/11/01).
These include alterations to a historic property not in accordance with the Secretary's Standards (noted above) and the transfer, sale, or lease of a historic property out of federal ownership or control without proper legal restrictions or covenants assuring its protection.
The exception for data recovery regarding archaeological sites, that is, excavation for the scientific knowledge the site contained, has also been eliminated.
Such action is now considered an adverse effect.
FHWA considers the views of the SHPO/THPO and other consulting parties and the public 2-10 in applying the Criteria of Adverse Effect.
FHWA may propose a finding of "No Adverse Effect" (NAE) when the undertaking's effects do not meet those established in the Criteria.
FHWA documents the finding of NAE and provides it to all consulting parties.
The SHPO/THPO has 30 days from the receipt of adequate documentation to review the finding.
If there is no disagreement with this finding, FHWA may proceed with the undertaking.
If the SHPO/THPO does not respond within 30 days of the receipt of the finding FHWA may consider this as agreement of the SHPO/ THPO with the finding.
FHWA must maintain a record of the finding (36 CFR Part 800.5[d][1]
If the undertaking changes prior to its implementation, FHWA must reopen the consultation process concerning the project.
If the SHPO/THPO or any consulting parties disagree with FHWA's NAE finding in the 30day review period, FHWA will either consult with the objecting party to resolve the disagreement or request the ACHP to review the finding.
FHWA provides all pertinent documentation to the ACHP.
The ACHP will notify FHWA of its determination as to whether the adverse effect criteria have been correctly applied within 15 days of having received the documented finding.
The ACHP will specify the basis for its final determination and this determination will be binding.
FHWA will proceed according to this determination.
If the ACHP does not respond to the FHWA in the allotted 15 day time frame following receipt of documentation from FHWA, the agency may assume ACHP concurrence with its NAE finding and proceed accordingly.
If it is determined by FHWA and the consulting parties that an "Adverse Effect" to a historic property or properties has occurred as a result of the undertaking, then consultation continues under Step 4 of the Section 106 process (see flow chart on page 2-7) to resolve the adverse effect(s).
2.5.4 Step 4: Resolve Adverse Effects In this step, FHWA continues the consultation process established in Step 3 in an attempt to resolve the undertaking's adverse effect on a historic property.
As previously noted, an adverse effect is one that results in the alteration of any of the characteristics of a significant cultural resource that qualifies the property for inclusion in the National Register.
FHWA consults with the SHPO/THPO and other consulting parties to develop and evaluate alternatives or modifications to the undertaking that could avoid, minimize, or mitigate the adverse effect to the property.
FHWA also notifies the ACHP of the adverse effect finding and provides appropriate documentation to the Council.
This documentation includes a description of the undertaking and APE, information about the identification process and affected historic properties, a discussion of project effects and why the adverse effect finding is applicable, and the views of the consulting parties on the process.
The ACHP will advise the agency and the consulting parties within 15 days of receipt of the finding and the documentation as to whether it will participate in the consultation.
The ACHP may also enter the process for other reasons such as a request from an involved party or if a National Historic Landmark is involved in the undertaking.
If the ACHP decides not to participate, FHWA continues to proceed with the consultation process.
At this point, FHWA, the SHPO/THPO, and the ACHP (if participating), may agree to 2-11 invite other individuals or organizations to become consulting parties.
This will certainly be the case for any individual or organization that will assume a specific role or responsibility in the development and implementation of an MOA concerning resolution of the adverse effect.
FHWA provides all appropriate documentation to consulting parties subject to the confidentiality provisions of 36 CFR Part 800.11(c).
FHWA also makes similar information available to the public and provides the public with an opportunity to express their views on resolving the adverse effects of the undertaking.
If the ACHP is not participating, FHWA consults with the SHPO/THPO and the other consulting parties to devise ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the adverse effects.
First consideration is given to alternative ways of accomplishing the agency's goals without unacceptably damaging the National Register listed or eligible property.
This may include consideration of alternative sites, alternative alignments, and alternative designs as well as the "no build" option, which can be used to evaluate the importance of the undertaking against the severity of its effects.
If the consulting parties find that the consideration of such alternatives does not result in a viable solution that best serves the public interest, they can proceed to a discussion of mitigation measures.
Mitigation refers to actions that reduce or compensate for the impacts an undertaking may have on a National Register listed or eligible property.
This process and options are described and discussed in detail in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of this Handbook.
If the consulting parties agree on how to resolve the adverse effects, a MOA will be executed.
These parties will typically become signatories to the MOA along with others who may be invited to sign.
The MOA is the document that records the terms and conditions agreed upon to resolve the adverse effects of an undertaking on historic properties.
The executed MOA with appropriate documentation will be submitted to the ACHP prior to proceeding with the undertaking.
If the consulting parties fail to agree on the terms of the MOA, FHWA will request the ACHP to join the consultation process.
The Council will either join the process or proceed to comment on the process to the agency in which case the agency head must take the comments into account before reaching a final decision on the undertaking.
It should also be remembered that the ACHP had the right to join the process when originally contacted by FHWA concerning the adverse effect and participated as a consulting party throughout the process.
In some cases, it may be agreed that there are no mitigation measures available and that the adverse effects must be accepted in the public interest.
On the other hand, consulting parties may occasionally not be able to come to mutual agreement concerning the undertaking and its effects.
In this case, FHWA, the SHPO and/or THPO, or the ACHP (if participating) may decide to terminate consultation.
If this occurs, FHWA requests the ACHP's comments in accordance with 36 CFR Part 800.7(c).
The head of the federal agency shall then take into account the Council's comments before reaching a final decision on the undertaking.
The agency head will document the final decision on the undertaking that includes the rationale for the final decision and demonstrates that the Council's comments have been duly considered.
This documentation will be provided to the ACHP, all consulting parties, and to the public for notification purposes.
FHWA will either proceed or not proceed with the undertaking at this point.
Either way, this concludes the Section 106 process and satisfies the FHWA's statutory responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966 (as amended).

The Department acts as the agent of the FHWA in many aspects of the consultation process but the FHWA is ultimately responsible for compliance with the requirements of the regulations implementing Section 106 of the NHPA.
The objective of Native American consultation is to conduct good faith efforts to elicit information from the appropriate tribes concerning properties of traditional or historical importance to them.
Under Section 106 of the tation programs for the state.
As FHWA.
It is, therefore, the resp effort to identify the appropriate NHPA, FDOT acts as the agent of FHWA in enacting transpornoted above, the ultimate decisionmaking authority rests with onsibility of the FHWA to make a reasonable and good faith tribes to be consulted.
The Section 106 regulations define consultation as the "process of seeking, discussing, and considering the views of other participants, and, where feasible, seeking agreement with them regarding matters arising in the section 106 process" (36 CFR Part 800 Section 800.16(f)).
As defined in the NHPA and the implementing regulations, Indian tribes are those tribes that have received formal recognition by the United States.
Specifically, "Indian tribe means an Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community...., which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians" (36CFR Part 800 Section 800.16 (m)).
In Florida, consultation takes place with the following five federally recognized tribes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ T T T T T h h h h h e e e e e Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida Muscogee Creek Nation Poarch Band of Creek Indians Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and Seminole Tribe of Florida All five tribes are part of the former Creek Confederacy with ancestral lands throughout the southeastern United States.
Two tribes currently reside and have tribal lands in the state: the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
Although the Muscogee Creek Nation, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians and the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma do not currently have reservation lands in the state, they at one time lived in Florida and have a 2-16 direct historical and cultural association with the state.
They, therefore, are tribes that are culturally affiliated with the state of Florida.
Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida was originally part of the same group of Creek Indians as the Seminole Tribe who fought against the U.S. government during the Seminole Wars of the 1800s
.They took refuge in the Everglades during these wars and were part of the small group that was not removed to Oklahoma following the war.Eventually, they split from the Seminole Tribe to become an independent tribe and, in 1962, were formally recognized by the U.S. government.
Today, they have a population of approximately 550 individuals and three reservation areas in the state of Florida: Tamiami Trail, Alligator Alley and Krome Avenue.
The Tamiami Trail Reservation area, located 40 miles west of Miami, is the site of most tribal operations, and the center of the Miccosukee Indian population.
Alligator Alley is the largest of the Tribe's reservations, comprising 74,812.37 acres.
It is located west of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, lying north and south of State Highway 84 (Alligator Alley), and includes a service station plaza, a Miccosukee Police Substation, wetlands, and land used for cattle grazing.
The Krome Avenue reservation consists of the Miccosukee Gaming Facility and Convention Center and the Miccosukee Tobacco Shop, located at the intersection of Krome Avenue and Tamiami Trail.
For additional information consult the Miccosukee website (http://www.miccosukee.com).
Muscogee Creek Nation The Muscogee (Creek) people are descendents of a culture that, before AD 1500, spanned the entire region known today as the Southeastern United States.
Early ancestors of the Muscogee constructed earthen pyramids along the rivers of this region as part of their elaborate ceremonial complexes.
The historic Muscogee later built expansive towns within these same broad river valleys in the present states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina.
In the removal treaty of 1832, Muscogee leadership exchanged the last of their ancestral homelands for new lands in Indian Territory (Oklahoma).
The U.S. Army enforced the removal of more than 20,000 Muscogee (Creeks) to Indian Territory in 1836 and 1837.
Today, the Muscogee Creek Nation is located in Oklahoma and has land claims in the Florida panhandle.
The tribal headquarters is located in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, and the tribe has approximately 44,000 tribal members.
It, along with the Seminole Nation, is considered one of the "five civilized tribes," a name bestowed by the U.S government because of the belief that these tribes adapted more quickly than others to European ways.

Poarch Band of Creek Indians The Poarch Band of Creek Indians was historically part of the Creek Confederacy with territory primarily in Georgia and Alabama.
The Poarch represent one of the few groups that was not removed to Indian Territory by the United States government, and have lived together for nearly 150 years.
They have a 400-acre reservation in southern Alabama on the Florida border, 2-17 but tribal members also live off-reservation in Escambia County, Florida.
Federal recognition was obtained in 1984 and, currently, there are approximately 2,127 members of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians.
Additional information on the Poarch Band of Creek Indians can be found at http://www.poarchcreekindians.org.
Seminole Nation of Oklahoma In 1856, the U.S government established the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma in Indian Territory.
They are historically associated with the Seminole Tribe of Florida and represent the more than 3,000 Seminoles who were removed from Florida by the U.S government at the end of the Seminole Wars in the 1800s.
Consequently, the Seminole Nation considers Florida its ancestral home and has historical and cultural connections to the state.
The tribal headquarters are located at Wewoka (meaning Barking Waters), which is the county seat of Seminole County.The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma currently has around 12,000 enrolled tribal members, of which about 60 percent live within or near the Seminole Nation boundaries.
Except for about 700 not living in Oklahoma, the remaining 40 percent of tribal members live in other parts of the state.
Additional information about the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma can be found on its website at http: //www.cowboy.net/native/seminole.
Seminole Tribe of Florida The Seminoles are composed of various culturally related Creek tribes that began to migrate into northern Florida sometime before 1750.
In all likelihood, those Indians who survived the period of European settlement and the resultant diseases were absorbed into the Seminole Tribe as they migrated south into Florida.
During and following the Seminole Wars, approximately 300 Seminoles took refuge in the Everglades and avoided removal to Indian Territory.
Their descendants form the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
In 1957, a majority of these people voted to establish an administrative entity called the Seminole Tribe of Florida and, in that same year, the U.S. Congress officially recognized them as an Indian tribe
.Those who chose to not become members of the newly-formed Seminole Tribe either remained independent or eventually joined together to form the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.
Today, the Seminole Tribe of Florida has almost 3,000 members living on six reservations across the peninsula: Hollywood (formerly Dania), Big Cypress, Brighton, Fort Pierce, Immokalee, and Tampa.

The FHWA and the Department have worked diligently with the tribes to establish the trust relationships and mutual understanding essential to successful coordination efforts.
FHWA, SHPO, and the Department are currently involved in ongoing consultation meetings with representatives of the Native American tribes living in or having cultural affiliation with Florida.
This dialogue has its foundation in Section 106 discussion meetings and project related coordination begun in 1999.
The objectives of the current meetings are to build partnerships and to identify 2-18 transportation-related issues of concern to both the agencies and tribes.
These issues include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Establishing effective communication channels; Establishing appropriate communication protocols; Enhancing mutual respect and understanding; Encouraging growth of cultural sensitivity; Understanding roles and responsibilities under pertinent laws and regulations; Respecting tribal sovereignty; Understanding agency concerns for production schedules and costs; Understanding tribal concerns for Native American sacred and cultural resources; and Streamlining the consultation process.
The ultimate goal of this Native American consultation effort is to complete a Memorandum of Understanding between the agencies and tribes that will ensure compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and expedite the consultation process Major Issues Coordination with the five federally recognized tribes represents a developing and evolving process that, to date, has identified the following four major issues of concern to the tribes: 1 2 3 4 . . . .
Government-to-government relationship Confidentiality Human Remains Archaeological Sites Government-to-Government Relationship C o n s u l t a t i o n w i t h a N a t i v e A m e r i c a n t r i b e m u s t r e c o g n i z e t h e " g o v e r n m e n t - t o - g o v e r nment" relationship that exists between the federal government and federally recognized Native A m e r i c a n t r i b e s a n d s h o u l d b e c o n d u c t e d i n a s e n s i t i v e m a n n e r t h a t i s r e s p e c t f u l o f t r i b a l s o vereignty.
Indian tribes are sovereign governments that exist within the boundaries of the United States.
As such, the U.S government has a unique relationship with the tribes that derives from the Constitution, treaties, Supreme Court decisions, and federal laws and authorities.
Therefore, all initial coordination efforts must take place on a government-to-government level.
Technically, this means that the head of FHWA coordinates directly with each tribal Chief or Chairperson.
In recognition that this may not be workable on a day-to-day basis, the FHWA, in conjunction with the FDOT, initiated the government-to-government relationship with each of the five tribes and is in the process of developing a workable protocol that will satisfy tribal and agency objectives.
While the proper protocol is being established, Native American tribes should be kept informed of each step of the Section 106 process.
2-19 Until the official protocol and procedures for conducting consultation are completed, the District Cultural Resource Mangers should contact the FDOT Native American Coordinator with questions regarding the information to be provided to the tribes.
Confidentiality Native American people are often "held to norms of secrecy and confidentiality" when dealing with sacred information, and the mere act of revelation to an outsider can constitute a violation of traditional religious and cultural norms.
Because of this, Indian tribes are often concerned about revealing the locations of their religious and cultural sites.
Providing such information on traditional use areas, such as plant gathering places, ceremonial centers, and burial mounds, to the public may also lead to the disruption of its use or even destruction by curious or ill-intentioned people.
Section 204 of the NHPA allows agencies to withhold information regarding an undertaking or its effects if it determines that such information would: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cause a significant invasion of privacy; Risk harm to the resource; or Impede the use of a traditional religious site by its practitioners.
Additionally, legislation enacted by the Florida state legislature in January 2002 exempts the locations of archaeological sites in Florida from the provisions of what is commonly referred to as the "Sunshine Law," (s.119.07 (1) and 2.24(a) of Article I of the State Constitution).
The law allows agencies to limit the distribution of location information on sites vulnerable to looting or vandalism, in particular, prehistoric archaeological sites.
Again, FHWA and FDOT are currently working with the tribes to identify those cases where confidentiality is desired or required.
In the meantime, the District Cultural Resource Managers should consult with the FDOT Native American Coordinator to determine the need for withholding such information.
Human Remains Human remains are a matter of cultural, historical, and sacred significance to Indian tribes and should not be looked at only in an archaeological context.
For archaeologists, the significance of human remains sites lies in their ability to provide biological, pathological, epidemiological, dietary, and mortuary information that will assist in better describing, understanding, and explaining past human behavior and historical processes.
Many Native Americans, on the other hand, view such interests as incompatible with their traditional beliefs and values.
So strong are their beliefs regarding the sacredness of these types of sites that some tribes refuse to even discuss the subject of death.
Not surprisingly, the excavation of human remains for the purposes of scientific investigation is viewed as abhorrent to them and tantamount to an unauthorized 2-20 exhumation of their ancestors.
The discovery of human remains must, therefore, be approached with a great deal of cultural sensitivity and an understanding that, to Native Americans, human remains are sacred.
In the event that human remains are found during any project, the provisions of Chapter 872 (see Chapter 1 of this Handbook) must be followed.
Briefly, this law states that when "an unmarked human burial is discovered..., all activity that may disturb the unmarked human burial shall cease" and may not resume until authorized by either the District Medical Examiner or the State Archaeologist [(872.05(4)].
If human remains less than 75 years old are encountered or if they are involved in a criminal investigation, the District Medical Examiner has jurisdiction.
If the remains are determined to be more than 75 years of age, then the State Archaeologist takes the lead in determining appropriate treatments and options for the remains.
In cases where the State Archaeologist has jurisdiction, the State Archaeologist will set up a committee to initiate consultation and make decisions regarding the steps to be taken to satisfy the legal requirements of Chapter 872, F.S.
It is advisable to notify the FDOT Native American Coordinator immediately to ensure that the proper legal procedures are followed.
Archaeological Sites To non-Indians, the past, as reflected in archaeological sites, is not part of their cultural heritage, traditional religious system, or ancestral sites.
By the very nature of their profession, archaeologists are trained to view archaeological sites as sources of information about the past to be excavated and analyzed, and a means to better understand the way of life of Native American groups.
To Native Americans, archaeological sites are part of their ongoing cultural traditions and are frequently referred to as ancestral or cultural sites.
Consequently, these sites remain an integral part of their history and culture.
In many cases, such sites may have more importance than the scientific value that can be yielded through excavation.
It is, therefore, imperative that Native American tribes be consulted regarding these sites.
It is also recommended that the District Cultural Resource Managers consult with the Department's Native American Coordinator for any project where significant archaeological sites are identified during the CRAS.
The Native American Coordinator can help provide direction to assure that the tribes receive the proper information and are included in determining effects and providing input in ways to minimize, avoid or mitigate adverse effects.
2-21 Native American Tribal Contacts (updated July 16, 2003) Native American consultation regarding archaeological resources represents one of the most challenging Section 106 compliance issues.
The need to establish a cooperative relationship between the Department, FHWA, and the five federally recognized tribes affiliated with Florida is critical to ensure compliance with the law and to meet project schedules.
The Department is actively developing a workable consultation process that incorporates Native American concerns in all phases of the Section 106 review process.
Therefore, please consult with the Department Native American Coordinator and the FHWA with questions regarding the consultation process.
