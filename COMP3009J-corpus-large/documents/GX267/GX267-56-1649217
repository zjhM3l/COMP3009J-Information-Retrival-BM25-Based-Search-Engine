69 Foreword
This publication has been prepared to assist districts in developing and implementing effective programs for gifted and talented students as required by accreditation standard 10.55.804 (Appendix A).
This office, along with the Montana Gifted Education Advisory board and the publication's principal author, Sue Kidd, are providing Montana educators with a series of research-based, best practice publications.
As raise the students districts we seek to improve educational practices in our schools, we must not only base level of expectations for all, but also expand at the top to allow capable to go beyond and reach their potential.
This series of publications will assist in raising the "ceiling as well as the floor."
The program for the gifted and talented should reinforce and be compatible with other programs within the same institution.

Foreword 1 2 Gifted Education Resource Guide Prologue Educators are now rethinking and redesigning our educational systems.
There are advocates for Outcome-Based Education, Total Quality Management in Education, Site-Based Management, Heterogeneous Grouping, Authentic Assessment, Cooperative Learning, and Distance Learning.
Each of these ideas give us new insights into the educational process.
Some of them have real merit, others may be just tinkering with the system.
We must remember our mission: to educate our children.
It is time to review our basic philosophy and to use sound principles of learning to redesign systems and address student needs.
Developers of programs for high-ability learners must remember that our programs are part of the total educational system.
We must be willing to sit down at the table with our fellow citizens to develop the plan to educate our students--all of our students.
We must be willing to fight for the programs and services that can be demonstrated to work for our high ability learners and to let go of those that do not.
In our quest to develop programs where high-ability students can be challenged to reach their potential, it is appropriate to consider the derivation of the word "intelligence" and to measure our programs against it.
"Intelligence is derived from two words--inter and legere--inter meaning `between' and legere meaning `to choose.'
An intelligent person, therefore, is one who has learned `to choose between.'
He knows that good is better than evil, that confidence should supersede fear, that love is superior to hate, that gentleness is better than cruelty, forbearance than intolerance, compassion than arrogance, and that truth has more virtue than ignorance."

U. S. Dept. of Education Prologue 3 4 Gifted Education Resource Guide Chapter 1 Getting Started Providing a quality education to meet the needs of all our children is an exemplary goal of the community, the state, and the nation.
This manual is an attempt to bring the latest thinking and research in educational programming to help you and your community design or renew your program.
This manual focuses on the particular needs of the high-ability student (in some areas called the Gifted/Talented student) but with the view that the programming for these students is only a part of the continuum of educational possibilities for all students.
We are also aware that communities differ in some ways but also share many similarities.
This manual is designed to guide all types of communities, whether they are small or large, rural, urban or suburban.
The focus of this manual is on developing a program to meet the needs of high-ability learners from kindergarten through high school graduation.
Who should be part of the process of developing a program? What part should or could they play? 1.
District Commitment: the district commits to developing and implementing program.
MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES: TMMMA It is essential that you review the necessary elements needed for program success.
They are: Time-- Money-- Manpower-- To develop, implement, inservice, and assess.
For staff, staff development and materials.
To develop, implement, and carry out programming.
Providing a quality education to meet the needs of all our children is an exemplary goal of the community, the state, and the nation.
Management-- Skills and staff to manage programming.
Authority-- To develop, implement, and carry out programming.
Getting Started 5 All successful programs must consider these factors.
You may need to be creative, but you must make provisions for each of them.
2.
The Steering Committee: an ongoing committee whose major functions are to oversee the development and function of the district program and to advocate for the program (approximately 10-15 interested people).
Consists of a broad base of community members, each representative of a portion of the community and the school district's resources and interests.
Included might be: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ classroom teachers representing each of the levels in the district administrators school psychologists counselors or social service representatives parents school board representative gifted student advocates business and/or professional representative (could be through the local Chamber of Commerce) Ã¯Â¿Â½ civic representative (could be from a local service club) Ã¯Â¿Â½ students (male and female, middle and/or high school) Ã¯Â¿Â½ teachers with an interest/training in gifted education Responsibilities of the steering committee Ã¯Â¿Â½ become knowledgeable of the needs of high-ability students and best practices in their education Ã¯Â¿Â½ write the program philosophy statement Ã¯Â¿Â½ set program goals Ã¯Â¿Â½ oversee, monitor and validate the work of the planning committee Ã¯Â¿Â½ develop a time line for program development, implementation, and evaluation Ã¯Â¿Â½ act as an advocate in the community 3.
Planning Committee: a short-term committe whose task is to develop the district's program.
The committee may be made up of members of the Steering Committee and/or other interested individuals.
Responsibilities of the committee: This is the objective of the whole enterprise: to design a program that will successfully address the issues that created a need for it in the first place.
--Borland, James H., 1989, p.49 6 Gifted Education Resource Guide Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ complete a needs assessment What do we have? What do we need? define the population to be served devise the identification process develop the program options and levels of service provide for inservice training on: --characteristics and identification of high-ability students --current best practices --curriculum differentiation program options and levels of service design and conduct the program assessment and renewal act as advocates in the school and community NEEDS ASSESSMENT: What Do We Already Have/What Do We Need? The first task of the planning committee is to conduct the needs assessment.
The first task of the planning committee is to conduct the needs assessment.
This is an assessment of the programming options that are available and appropriate in the present system, perceived program needs of the district and perceptions about gifted students.
The needs assessment should address the following topics: Issues related to those who are the gifted.
For example: Can gifted students be gifted in only one subject area or is the perception that gifted students are gifted in all areas? What percentage of the school population should be identified as gifted? Should gifted education include the art and music areas or is it limited to academics? Issues related to programming for the gifted.
How can the program facilitate students progressing through the curriculum at a faster rate? How can the program facilitate independent learning and mentorships? How should highly creative students be accommodated by the program? How should non-motivated, high-potential students be accommodated in the program? What are the responsibilities of teachers who work with gifted students? Getting Started 7 Issues about current school programing.
Does the present educational program provide: The gifted program must be compatible with the general program, yet differentiated.
--Margo Long a strong general curriculum to establish a foundation upon which excellence can be built appropriate academic pacing (flexible pacing including acceleration) opportunities to develop in-depth studies experiences in critical and creative thinking, problem solving and decision making opportunities to recognize and develop relationships among various disciplines opportunities to relate to, and interact with, other high-ability students appropriate counseling services (personal, college, and career) opportunities to develop independence, self-direction and discipline in learning Issues related to current services should be addressed if a district program currently exists and is being renewed through this process.
How challenging is the course work in the current program? How challenging is the course work in the general school program? Questionnaires should be developed and distributed to parents of currently identified gifted students, parents of prior identified gifted students, parents of high ability but not yet identified students, identified gifted students, students enrolled in honors or higher-level high school classes, all administrators, randomly selected teachers K12, all counselors, psychologists and other interested community members.
This information provides the basis around which programming for high-ability students will be developed.
(See Appendix B for an example of a needs assessment from Great Falls Public Schools.)

Evaluate and revise ___ Evaluate and revise program options, identification procedure, levels of service and program implementation to support program philosophy and goals Getting Started 9 Flow Chart Checklist for Program Development In this chapter, we are developing an administrative response to the needs of high-ability students.
Our best programs will be rooted in theory but designed to meet the specific needs of our high-ability students in our individual districts.
We might think of the theoretical model as a ball sitting on a shelf.
It is obviously a ball but it doesn't do anything.
The ball becomes the administrative model when it is used in a real game and bounces, scores points and really does something.
A Brief Look at Theory Our best programs will be rooted in theory but designed to meet the specific needs of our highability students in our individual districts.
Exemplary educational systems are always grounded in sound principles; however, there is always a need for REvision, REnewal, and REformation in the administration of our educational programs to REalign our programs with our chosen principles.
Perhaps the best framework of "learner-centered principles" is a collaboration between the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Mid-Continent Regional Educational Laboratory (McREL).
This new publication (1993) is an extensive project developed and reviewed by the top psychologists, educators, professionals in various scientific disciples, and also a wide range of professional groups.
These principles can act as guidelines for educational reform and school redesign.
What are these sound principles of education? Metacognitive and Cognitive Factors Principle 1: The nature of the learning process.
Learning is a natural process of pursuing personally meaningful goals, and it is active, volitional, and internally mediated; it is a process of discovering and constructing meaning from information and experience, filtered through the learner's unique perceptions, thoughts, and feelings.
Principle 2: Goals of the learning process.
The learner seeks to create meaningful, coherent representations of knowledge regardless of the quantity and quality of data available.
Principle 3: The construction of knowledge.
The learner links new information with existing and future-oriented knowledge in uniquely meaningful ways.
Principle 4: Higher-order thinking.
Higher-order strategies for "thinking about thinking"--for overseeing and monitoring mental operations--facilitate creative and 10 Gifted Education Resource Guide critical thinking and the development of expertise.
Affective Factors Principle 5: Motivational influences on learning.
The depth and breadth of information processed and what and how much is learned and remembered are influenced by (a)self-awareness and beliefs about personal control, competence, and ability; (b) clarity and saliency of personal values, interests, and goals; (c) personal expectations for success or failure; (d) affect, emotion, and general state of mind; and (e) the resulting motivation to learn.
Principle 6: Intrinsic motivation to learn.
Individuals are naturally curious and enjoy learning, but intense negative cognitions and emotions (e.g., feeling insecure, worrying about failure, being self-conscious or shy, and fearing corporal punishment, ridicule, or stigmatizing labels) thwart this enthusiasm.
Principle 7: Characteristics of motivation-enhancing learning tasks.
Curiosity, creativity, and higher-order thinking are stimulated by relevant, authentic learning tasks of optimal difficulty and novelty for each student.
Exemplary educational systems are always grounded in sound principles; however, there is always a need for REvision, REnewal, and REformation in the administration of our educational programs to REalign our programs with our chosen principles.
Developmental Factors Principle 8: Developmental constraints and opportunities.
Individuals progress through stages of physical, intellectual, emotional, and social development that are a function of unique genetic and environmental factors.
Personal and Social Factors Principle 9: Social and cultural diversity.
Learning is facilitated by social interactions and communication with others in flexible, diverse (in age, culture, family background, etc.), and adaptive instructional settings.
Principle 10: Social acceptance, self-esteem, and learning.
Learning and self-esteem are heightened when individuals are in respectful and caring relationships with others who see their potential, genuinely appreciate their unique talents.
and accept them as individuals.
Individual Differences Principle 11: Individual differences in learning.
Although basic principles of learning, motivation, and effective instruction apply to all learners (regardless of ethnicity, Getting Started 11 race, gender, physical ability, religion, or socioeconomic status), learners have different capabilities and preferences for learning mode and strategies.
These differences are a function of environment (what is learned and communicated in different cultures or other social groups) and heredity (what occurs naturally as a function of genes).
Principle 12: Cognitive filters.
Personal beliefs, thoughts, and understandings resulting from prior learning and interpretations become the individual's basis for constructing reality and interpreting life experiences.
--Mid-Continent Regional Educational Laboratory, January 1993 These principles have direct implications to the programs we design for our students.
Many current programs for high-ability students are rooted in these principles and have proven their worth.
It is vital that we keep them in mind as we develop, REdesign and REnew our programs.
Exemplary educational systems are always grounded in sound principles; however, there is always a need for re/vision, re/newal, and re/formation in the administration of our educational programs to re/align our programs with our chosen principles.

Your program philosophy is the base upon which all else must rely.
The philosophy of your program for high-ability learners must be built on, and aligned with (integrated into), your district's adopted philosophy for the education of all students.
The philosophy provides the rationale (the why) for developing and implementing appropriate programs for high-ability students.
To develop the rationale, consider: Who are the high-ability students? What are their unique needs? How are their needs different from other learners? How can we meet these needs? Remember that the answers to the basic questions will be the foundation for your program.
We will now consider each of them briefly.
We came with VISION, not with sight.
--Wendall Berry Who are the high-ability students? Many theories about "giftedness" or high-ability students have been developed.
However, the definition developed as part of the 1978 federal report known as the "Marland Report" is most widely used.
(The gifted and talented are)"...children and, whenever applicable, youth who are identified at the pre-school, elementary, or secondary levelS as possessing demonstrated or potential abilities that give evidence of high performance capability in areas such as intellectual, creative, specific academic or leadership ability or in the performing and visual arts, and who by reason thereof require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the school."
(U.S. Congress, Educational Amendments of 1978 [P.L. 95-561, IX(A)]) Philosophy 13 A 1993 review of that definition has resulted in an updated definition of who gifted children are.
"Children and youth with outstanding talent perform or show the potential for performing at remarkably high levels of accomplishment when compared with others of their age, experience, or environment.
These children and youth exhibit high performance capability in intellectual, creative, and/or artistic areas, possess an unusual leadership capacity, or excel in specific academic fields.
They require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the schools.
Outstanding talents are present in children and youth from all cultural groups, across all economic strata, and in all areas of human endeavor."
NATIONAL EXCELLENCE: THE CASE FOR DEVELOPING AMERICA'S TALENT, U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and improvement, October 1993.
By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.
--Ben Franklin What are their unique needs? How are their needs different from other students? For purposes of the education of high-ability students, they are those students in a given school or school district who are exceptional by virtue of markedly greaterthan-average potential or ability in some area of human activity generally considered to be the province of the educational system and whose exceptionality engenders special educational needs that are not being met adequately by the regular core curriculum.
(Borland, 1989, p. 52) This definition is based on the student's need for educational programming to enable each student to reach his/her full potential.
In general, gifted students need curriculum and services that vary the depth, breadth, complexity and pace of instruction due to their ability to learn at faster rates, deal with high levels of abstraction, and make associations other children would not be able to make.
Educational needs are not always academic.
These students also have social and emotional needs that should be addressed at all levels.
In addition, at the secondary level these students have special needs for a variety of experiences in cultural and career education, as well as special counseling services.
(Feldhusen, 1990; p. 19) 14 Gifted Education Resource Guide How can we meet these needs? Your program can meet the needs of high-ability learners by assuring that the programs you develop are: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ grounded on a firm philosophical base that is agreed upon and supported by the community rooted in the principles of sound educational practice aligned with and integrated into the educational program for all students in the community qualitatively differentiated from the regular program (varied in depth, breadth, complexity and pace) The following are four sample philosophy statements.
It is vitally important that your committee develop its own statement of philosophy and definitions which reflect local needs and values.
The local development of these components build crucial local ownership.
Without ownership, the program's success could be endangered.
These are the foundations to which you will return for evaluation and renewal.
Fundamental to the basic ideals of a democratic society is the belief in the intrinsic worth of each individual citizen.
To ensure the maintenance and improvement of the quality of life in such a society, it is essential to provide educational opportunities for each individual to maximize his/her potential.
Thus, society, by providing for the growth of the individual, will in turn reap the benefits.
For the minority of children at the upper end of the mental ability continuum, the regular education program is inappropriate.
The needs, interests, and readiness of these pupils combine to form a mismatch with programs which are relevant for their more average age-mates.
They require special educational considerations to more fully realize their potential.
(adapted from State of California and Nebraska It is vitally important that your committee develop its own statement of philosophy and definitions which reflect local needs and values.
Philosophy 15 The Aurora Public Schools are dedicated to meeting the needs of every student.
In a democratic society, which seeks to offer educational opportunities appropriate to each child's ability, it is necessary to provide for the unique needs of the gifted and talented (high-ability learner).
(The gifted and talented) are those pupils whose abilities, talents, and potential for accomplishment are so outstanding that they require a variety of special provisions in addition to the usual curriculum to meet their educational needs.
The purpose of the AGATE program is to provide the academically gifted/ talented student with extensions for learning which provide a variety of educational experiences beyond those normally provided.
Enhancing the self as a learner and as a producer is of primary concern.
Activities, opportunities, and programs are thus structured to assist the student in assessing the capabilities upon the unique abilities, talents, interests, and needs which represent him/her as a "self."
(Aurora, Colorado) Programs must be grounded on a firm philosophical base that's agreed upon and supported by the community.
Appropriate gifted programs are based on a belief that excellent education for the gifted will result in excellence in our society.
This premise is part of a foundation upon which these guidelines are built.
* The belief in equal opportunity of education for all, according to individual ability and need, so that each student may have his/her potential challenged to a high degree.
* The belief that this equal opportunity is necessary and good for both the individual and society.
* The belief in the development of differential programs and the flexibility in the implementation thereof to provide for individual differences in regard to intellectual, social, and emotional abilities.
* The belief that the student should be able to engage in educational experiences that both provide a firm foundation in knowledge accumulated to date and enable that existing knowledge to serve as a basis for creativity, innovation and invention.
16 Gifted Education Resource Guide (continued) These guidelines reflect Pennsylvania's continuing commitment to provide a free, appropriate, public education for the mentally gifted consistent with their individual needs and outstanding abilities.
The XYZ Public School has the responsibility to provide services that meet the needs of all students to develop their potential.
Highly capable students have special needs created by their high degree of sensitivity, wide range of interests, advanced verbal and academic skills, rapid rate of learning, and a greater capability for higher-level thinking.
Intellectual, academic, and creative talents can paradoxically be a handicap in an educational situation designed to meet the needs of the majority of students.
XYZ School is committed to providing these students with a learning environment flexible enough to allow a diversity of options in order to maximize their potential.
The Extended Studies program will provide support and resources to teachers, students and parents.
It is vitally important that your committee develop its own statement of philosophy and definitions which reflect local needs and values.
Chapter three provides information about theories and definitions of giftedness are helpful to consider in the development of the philosophy statement.
See Appendix C for a sample school board policy that elaborates upon the philosophy statement.

It is a diagnostic and prescriptive approach to providing needed services.
This chapter provides insight into how theories of intelligence and definitions of giftedness are incorporated into the local program.
In effect, how to take the base components and align them with local needs.
The theoretical base that is chosen will direct the focus of the entire program from philosophy through identification and services.
DEFINITIONS OF GIFTEDNESS Purposes and Criteria for a Definition of Giftedness 1.
It must be based on the best available research about the characteristics of gifted individuals rather than a romanticized notion or unsupported opinion.
It must provide guidance in the selection and/or development of instruments and procedures that can be used to design defensible identification systems.
It must give direction and be logically related to the programming practices such as the selection of materials and instructional methods, the selection and training of teachers, and the determination of procedures that can be used for evaluation.
It must be capable of generating research studies that will verify or fail to verify the validity of the definition.
2.
3.
A sucessful program works because it effectively addresses the needs of gifted students in a specific school or school district and these needs generally vary from school to school, district to district.
--Borland, pg. 46 4.
Source: Unknown THEORETICAL USE OF DEFINITIONS This manual will focus on three definitions.
Since your program is being developed to meet the unique needs of the students in your community, you may wish to explore other definitions.
In development process, you will synthesize and adapt them as needed for your program.
Theories 
It defines the needs for talent development in the areas of intellectual, creative, specific academic, leadership, performing and visual arts.
By adopting this definition the district may centralize all services for high-ability students under one program.
Program options should address all of these areas.
Talent finding should address each of these areas and services should be structured to meet the needs of those determined to be the most talented or evidence the greatest potential talent in these areas.
Typically, the talent finding process for this model is divided into a screening section using a high percentile ranking on a standardized achievement test, a standardized aptitude test and a teacher rating scale; a preassessment period where the student is more closely monitored for high potential; and a more formal evaluation period in which individualized testing may occur.
This definition is widely used by many states and districts.
Montana State Law uses an adaptation of this one.
A criticism of this definition is that the categories are "frequently ambiguous, indefinable, or overlapping, and are frequently adopted without regard for their actual implications for identification or programming" (Treffinger and Renzulli, 1986 in Davis and Rimm, 1989, p. 13).
This definition was revised by the U.S. Department of Education in 1993.
The revision is included in chapter four.
If some degree of subjectivity cannot be tolerated, then our definition of giftedness and the resulting programs will logically be limited to abilities that can only be measured by objective tests.
--Renzulli, J.S.
"What makes giftedness: Reexamining a definition."
Phi Delta Kappan, 60, p.181) MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES THEORY The use of Howard Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences is redefining our view of intelligence, or human intellectual competence, and of the ways we can identify extraordinary potential.
Definitions grounded in this theory are directed toward the observation of an individual's ability to "resolve genuine problems or difficulties and, when appropriate, to create an effective product--and must also entail the potential for finding or creating problems--thereby laying the groundwork for the acquisition of new knowledge" (Gardner, l983,pp.60-61) Models are being developed and tested that rely on the trained observation of traits which seem to be common in people with extraordinary problem-solving potential.
These models attempt to identify this potential within the community's culture and to use these cultural traits to help define high potential.
This assures that the assessment of extraordinary potential is that which is valued in its own culture.
Using Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983), C. June Maker has developed the definition stating that the key element in giftedness or high competence is "The ability to solve the most complex problems in the most efficient, effective, or economical ways."According to this definition, a gifted individual possesses 20 Gifted Education Resource Guide abilities traditionally associated with both high intelligence and high creativity.
Such an individual is capable of: a. b. c. understanding problems already defined clearly, using the most efficient, effective, or economical methods that are known, and reaching appropriate solutions based on current knowledge and thought.
The gifted individual also is capable of: a. b. c. creating a new or clearer definition of an existing problem, devising new and more efficient, effective, or economical methods, and reaching solutions that may be different from the usual, but are recognized as being better than previous solutions.
(Maker, Educating Able Learners, Fall 1992, p.13) No single (predeveloped or theoretical) model can hope to meet the needs of school districts that differ along so many lines.
--Borland pg. 46 (parens added) This definition seems to have much merit.
The essence of the definition is that the gifted or highly able individual has superior problem-solving ability.
Another view of giftedness, also based on Gardner's work, is being proposed by Mary Frasier.
Her work indicates that we do not measure giftedness directly.
Instead, we infer giftedness by observing certain characteristics or behaviors of individuals (Hagan, 1980, pg. 1).
This model also includes the idea that "factors found in differing sociocultural contexts impact the manifestation of giftedness thereby influencing the way giftedness is identified" (Frasier, M.M., Martin, D.E., and Garcia, J. H., 1992).
Based on this work, a culturally unbiased identification system is being developed to help guide the identification and programming for high-ability students.
The system will be discussed in the next chapter on Identification.
THREE-RING MODEL DEFINITION Another frequently used definition is Renzulli's Three-Ring Model.
Renzulli (1986) argues that "Gifted behavior...reflects an interaction among three basic clusters of human traits--these clusters being above average (but not necessarily high) general and/or specific abilities, high levels of task commitment (motivation), and high levels of creativity.
Gifted and talented children are those possessing or capable of developing this composite set of traits and applying them to any potentially valuable area of human performance" (Davis and Rimm,1989).
Theories 
There is some concern in the field that this definition can lead to identifying only those students who are already succeeding in an educational program.
A systems approach or administrative model for gifted education tailor makes the program to fit the assessed needs of the local district.

Focus should be on diversity within gifted populations.
The gifted are not a homogeneous group nor do they express their talents in the same way.
The goal should be inclusion rather then exclusion.
Data should be gathered from multiple sources; a single criterion of giftedness should be avoided.
Both objective and subjective data should be used.
Professionals and nonprofessionals who represent various areas of expertise and who are knowledgeable about behavioral indicators of giftedness should be involved.
Identification should occur as early as possible and should be continuous.
Special attention should be given to the different ways in which children from different cultures manifest behavioral indicators of giftedness.
Decision making should be delayed until all pertinent data on a student has been reviewed.
Data collected during the identification process should be used to help determine the individual child's curriculum.

Identification of Students 23 SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR MEASURING POTENTIAL TALENT Three factors must be considered during the process of talent finding: test data, performance data, and developmental data.
Each plays its own part in finding talent and identifying the needs to be served by the program.
TEST DATA A variety of instruments are available.
Considerations must be made to select instruments that will effectively screen the talent your program is being planned to serve.
PERFORMANCE DATA This data is collected to demonstrate the student's accomplishments both in and out of school.
It includes the student's school records and any skills or products the student has developed inside or outside of school.
Screening is the ongoing process used to find all highability students in need of services.
DEVELOPMENTAL DATA This data comes from a variety of sources both inside the school (teachers, counselors, other staff ) and from the community and family.
It supports the test and performance data to suggest that this student is "ahead" of his/her age peers and helps define programming needs.
SCREENING AND PREASSESSMENT: FINDING POTENTIAL TALENT Screening is the ongoing process used to find all high-ability students in need of services.
It is important that we "cast the net" as widely as possible to assure that we "catch" all high-ability students; both those achieving at a high level and those who may not be at present.
Materials commonly used in the screening process are: test data-- group aptitude and achievement tests normally used by your district Ã¯Â¿Â½ the recommendation is to include all students scoring one standard deviation above the mean 24 Gifted Education Resource Guide performance and developmental data-- Ã¯Â¿Â½ cumulative records, student portfolios, student products and performances, plus observations by teachers, other professionals, parents, the community, and peers Preassessment in the screening process may also involve designing and implementing appropriate activities that highlight student's abilities in order to establish an educational need.
These may include specialized lessons, projects or other activities establishing educational need or designed to indicate the potential for performing at high levels of accomplishment when compared with others of their age, experience, or environment.
FORMAL ASSESSMENT: MEASURING POTENTIAL TALENT Formal assessment involves using measures to establish the educational potential and needs of the individual students which your program will serve.
Instruments and other indicators should be chosen whose results reflect and support the program goals and philosophy for which your program is designed.
Both objective and subjective measures should be used.
It is increasingly evident that subjective evaluation is vital if we are to achieve an equitable program free of bias.
Subjective measures include both performance and developmental data.
Well-designed and research-based subjective measures should be given equal consideration when compared with objective measures in the identification of high-ability students.
Several observation instruments have been developed and researched.
They are providing reliable results that tend to be bias free plus help to educate the observer as to the traits of the high-ability students.
Dr. Mary Fraxier, director of the University of Georgia National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, has formulated a method for identifying gifted children from varying cultural and economic groups.
Integrated throughout this systematic apprach are ten Traits, Aptitudes, and Behaviors (TABs) which have been found through research to be consistently associated with the psychological construct of giftedness.
The ten TABs are Motivation, Interests, Communication Skills, Problem-Solving Ability, Memory, Inquiry, Insight, Reasoning, Imagination/Creativity, and Humor.
These TABs serve as the basis for referral, assessment, creation of the individual student profile, and recommendations for meeting the student's needs.
An important component of this approach is the consideration that the TABs may be manifested differently among differing cultural or economic groups.
Identification of Students 25 If some degree of subjectivity cannot be tolerated, then our definition of giftedness and the resulting programs will logically be limited to abilities that can only be measured by objective tests --Renzulli, J.S.
What makes giftedness: Reexamining a definition.
Phi Delta Kappan, 60, p.181) The Research-Based Assessment plan was developed primarily as a means of finding and identifying a greater number of gifted students among traditionally underserved groups; however, its application as a means of equitably identifying gifted children from all groups of the general population merits serious consideration and thorough investigation.
A problem-solving based model was developed and is being tested by Dr. C. June Maker in the Southwest.
It relies on the observation of problem-solving abilities in defined problem situations.
This method is also culturally non-biased (Maker, 1992).
In the past, students were not identified until they were about eight years old.
This practice may cause problems for high-ability students whose needs are not being met in the early years of school.
The Kingore Observation Inventory (KOI) is an observation instrument which is used by classroom teachers to note the behaviors of K-3 high-ability students over a sixweek period of time.
It also serves as a curriculum-wide instructional focus in providing programs which accent the behaviors characteristic of gifted youth (Kingore, 1992).
The Early Assessment for Exceptional Potential Portfolio Process (Shaklee, 1989) for grades K-3 relies on multiple sources of data (six types of verbal and non-verbal) from a minimum of four persons who know the child well.
The data is collected over a 12-week time frame.
Shaklee's research indicated that teachers believe that the portfolios have a lot more weight than tests.
Her research also indicated that the teachers have made a major shift in blending instruction and management.
The teachers perceive themselves as having developed more child-centered classrooms which relieves them of a dictatorial role (Shaklee, 1992).
Using the collected data the instructional team determines the student's needs for additional programming.
This team, which includes involved staff, parents, and the student (if mature enough to participate), will develop the student's Individual Learning Plan.
FINAL PLACEMENT OF THE STUDENT Using the collected data the instructional team determines the student's needs for additional programming.
This team, which includes involved staff, parents, and the student (if mature enough to participate), will develop the student's Individual Learning Plan.
All of the data collected for evaluation should be used to design a plan to meet the student's educational needs.
Students included in the screening, but not formally placed, obviously have educational needs which are not being met.
A plan should be devised to meet these needs.
26 Gifted Education Resource Guide ACTION STEPS In summary, the components of a quality identification document are: I. Philosophy Statement A. B. Agree on a definition of high-ability students to be served by the program Define your program based on the theoretical model your community chooses and meets the needs of the students your community has committed to serve The correlation between IQ and achievement is about 0.60.
While this is a high correlation, it is not absolute.
This correlation means that about onethird of what is measured by achievement tests can be attributed to intelligence.
The other two-thirds can be attributed to motivation, interest, background, and other factors.

28 Gifted Education Resource Guide Chapter 5 Programming INTRODUCTION This chapter examines ways to utilize the opportunities currently available in your present curriculum, expand to new areas, and develop a comprehensive program.
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK This term is used to suggest a collection of programming options designed to match services to the needs of high-ability students.
This framework is comprehensive in that it includes the programming options already in place, validates them, and expands to include other options to meet the local needs.
It recognizes the strength of the regular classroom as the base of services and the opportunities and enrichment that the "essential" classroom teacher brings to that base.
It builds on the base to include options outside of the regular classroom to serve the special needs of some students, yet recognizes the needs of those few students who require even more individualized programming.
It emphasizes the importance of support services throughout a well-designed program.
Although this framework allows flexibility and provides a perspective of the "whole program," it is essential that each piece be a part of the integrated whole.
The support functions should be integrated throughout the program and are essential pieces to program development and implementation.
This framework is not tied to a particular philosophical or theoretical base and may be used with all identification processes.
The key concept in providing appropriate services to high-ability students is to offer options that place... "students at an appropriate instructional level, creating the best possible match between students' achievement and instruction, and allows them to move forward in the curriculum as they achieve mastery of content and skills" (Daniel, R. and Cox, J., Flexible Pacing for Able Learners, 1988).
This concept may be the single most important concept for designing programs for high-ability students.
Students must be able to move ahead on the basis of mastery.
As a mosaic is built piece by piece, the project (designing a program) builds upon current exemplary elements and adds new programs and new ideas.
--Gifted Students Institute Programming 29 Comprehensive Integrated Gifted Education Programming Framework for Identified Gifted and Talented Students The key concept in providing appropriate services to highability students is to offer options that place... "students at an appropriate instructional level, creating the best possible match between students' achievement and instruction, and allows them to move forward in the curriculum as they achieve mastery of content and skills" (Daniel, R. and Cox, J., Flexible Pacing for Able Learners, 1988).
30 Gifted Education Resource Guide OPTIONS WITHIN THE REGULAR CLASSROOM CURRICULUM MODIFICATION By using the curriculum "compacting" modification, the instructor can match the curriculum to the learner needs.
This approach is particularly successful in skillbased instructional areas, such as math, reading skills, spelling and language arts.
Three steps are integral to this process.
1.
Preassessment.
Before teaching a content/skill area, the instructor determines what parts of it the students already know.
Chapter tests, mastery tests and skills "spot" tests administered at the start of a new unit or chapter have all proved to be practical ways to preassess.
Modification.
Once the teacher knows the match between what students know and what they need to know in the curriculum, the teacher can modify for instruction.
Flexible grouping based on skills mastery is one effective, teacher-friendly way to accomplish this.
Students flow in and out of the instructional group based on the gaps in their skills knowledge.
Learning activities.
Students who have proven mastery of a particular set of skills or an entire chapter "buy" that instructional time to work on more appropriate curriculum.
To be successful for both students and teachers, learning opportunities need to be based on the student's individual interests, to focus on a student's strengths--not to shore up areas of weakness; to incorporate some degree of student choice, and to include a plan for structuring the student's use of time, as well as a standard of measurement for completed work.
These learning opportunities should provide an intellectual challenge for the student, not be "more of the same" activities.
2.
3.
Although enrichment and acceleration may be a part of the process, compacting encompasses much more.
It is, in fact, more closely associated with diagnosis and prescription, methods used in remedial education.
In remedial education, diagnosis and prescription point out learning objectives students have not yet mastered, and instruction is intended to help students "catch up" with the rest of the class.
With compacting, pretesting identifies learning objectives already mastered.
Students are allowed to "test out" of certain academic exercises and move on to new material.
Reis, Sally M., Deborah E. Burns, Joseph S. Renzulli, Curriculum Compacting: A Guide for Teachers, The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1992.
ENRICHMENT vs ACCELERATION All students should have enriching experiences as a regular part of their academic life.
Enrichment and acceleration are complimentary parts of a curriculum for highability students.
The critical point is that all three factors--content, process, and product-- Programming 31 must be both enriched and accelerated.
Without both acceleration and enrichment, more is simply more; the qualitative difference is not reached.
Other appropriate options for flexible pacing based on the students needs might be: early entrance into school or grade skipping cluster or ability grouping may be used particularly for skill work interest groups within and cross-grade level grouping compacted course work testing out of course work learning centers concurrent enrollment (dual enrollment in college and high school) early graduation DIFFERENTIATED CURRICULUM with flexible pacing...
In a comprehensive program for highability learners the core curriculum in the fundamental learning areas must be differentiated or modified.
These modifications may occur in the content, process, product and/or learning environment.
In a comprehensive program for high-ability learners the core curriculum in the fundamental learning areas must be differentiated or modified.
These modifications may occur in the content, process, product and/or learning environment.
Since this learning usually takes place in the regular classroom, the classroom teacher is the "essential" teacher in the delivery of the curriculum based on the needs of the student.

These proposals must then be revised, if necessary, and adopted by the steering committee.
At this time it is important that the local school board accept the proposals and adopt the necessary policy statements so that options such as early entrance, grade skipping, acceleration and test out, concurrent enrollment, and early graduation are supported by board policy.
You have to make friends long before you need them.
--Lyndon B. Johnson Program Design Standards of the Council for Exceptional Children Program design is the plan for the administrative configuration through which instruction is delivered to gifted and talented students.
Since these students are receiving service throughout the educational system, programs that fall into this category go beyond those designated as "G/T" and include all programs in which gifted and talented students are involved.
The intent is to build a flexible system of viable program options throughout the general and special education structures that are compatible with and can be matched to the strengths, needs, and interests of gifted and talented students.
1.
Programs for the Gifted and Talented Are Articulated With General Education Programs Programs for the gifted and talented are part of the general program offerings of the school district, as these students are typically involved in programs that are considered general education.
Articulation involves planning the extension of general education programs in order to address the needs of these students; policy review to assure that policies encourage involvement in rigorous programs; and communication between parties to keep all participants informed and the program developing.
.
Programs Are Comprehensive, Structured, and Sequenced Across Grade Levels Comprehensive programs for the gifted and talented go beyond academics and include options in areas such as the arts, leadership, and creativity.
These programs are planned and ordered so that students can continue to develop their skills.
The intent is to build a flexible system of viable program options throughout the general and special education structures that are compatible with and can be matched to the strengths, needs, and interests of gifted and talented students.

Programs Are an Integral Part of the School Day and May be Extended to Other School and Community-Related Settings Programs for the gifted and talented are central to the students' educational program and meet during the school day.
In some instances, programs may be held before or after school or in settings other than school when the nature of the experience (not the convenience of the schedule) requires this timing.
4.
Administrative Structures and Program Options Are Based on Student Needs The program options offered are determined by the needs of the students being served.
These options may vary based on the needs and resources of the community.
Ongoing needs assessments are necessary in order to assure that current needs and options are compatible.
5.
The program options offered are determined by the needs of the students being served.
All Gifted and Talented Students Are Assured Programs Commensurate With Their Abilities Programs are available that represent the varying ranges of ability and needs displayed by gifted and talented students.
Access to the programs is guaranteed to these students.
6.
Resources for Program Development and Implementation Are Distributed Equitably Throughout the School District Gifted and talented students throughout a school district are given appropriate educational programs regardless of the school they attend.
Resources are distributed based on student needs.
7.
Programs Incorporate a Blend of Community Resources and School-Based Support Services in Program Development and Delivery School psychologists, social workers, content area specialists, counselors, and community members add expertise to the planning and implementation of program options.
They expand the range of support for the programs and open doors to opportunities for students beyond those available through the district or individual program personnel.

In general, the learner goals we desire for high-ability students are to have the student: demonstrate a high level of mastery of the content and skills of the core curriculum master content and skills as appropriate develop and challenge abilities in using higher levels of thinking cultivate self-directed learning and self-evaluation skills produce original knowledge and products exhibit personal growth toward self-understanding and self-expression share a highly developed love of learning and doing demonstrate interpersonal growth and understanding The individual learning plan for a student should be developed with input from the classroom teacher or teachers, the enrichment specialist, the parents, the counselor, and the student, and any others involved in the implementation of the plan (e.g., mentors or administrators).
DESIGNING AN INDIVIDUAL LEARNING PLAN In the design of a plan for the individual student, each of the above factors, plus the student's interests and style of learning must be considered, as well as the curriculum and method of delivery so that the student has the opportunity to achieve the desired goals.
As evidenced in the learner goals for high-ability students, not only academic areas but also social and emotional goals are addressed.
It is vitally important that an individual learning plan address both of these areas.
The individual learning plan for a student should be developed with input from the classroom teacher or teachers, the enrichment specialist, the parents, the counselor, and the student, and any others involved in the implementation of the plan (e.g., mentors or administrators).
Academic Needs 41 The plan should indicate who is accountable for the implementation of the plan and who is responsible for the fulfillment of each goal or objective.
Generally, the program coordinator is responsible for the overall plan, but classroom teachers or mentors may be co-facilitators of the academic curriculum.
The counselor is often involved in the social/emotional areas of the plan.
Each participant (particularly parents and older students), plus the building administrator, should have a copy of the plan.
The plan should also indicate the date that the goals and objectives are to be implemented and when they are to be completed.
ACADEMIC ISSUES This plan should stress acceleration of the curriculum where appropriate, plus enrichment in the areas of interest.
Modifications to the curriculum for high-ability students involves a three-step process: 1.
The plan should indicate who is accountable for the implementation of the plan and who is responsible for the fulfillment of each goal or objective.

Credit is given for prior learning.
There is a reduction (compacting) of tasks and/or replacement of "regular" tasks with a more challenging study.
New experiences or activities are constructed and these activities capitalize on the students' strengths.
With a differentiated curriculum-based program, mastery of the learner goals in each content area is considered a basic educational requirement.
The natural extension or enrichment of these outcomes is necessary because of the early mastery of these outcomes by the student as compared to their age/grade peers.
"What Do They Know" --or--Credit for Prior Knowledge 42 Gifted Education Resource Guide assess prior learning using formalized tests, observations, or evaluation of student products depend on the established curriculum with defined objectives and assessment give students an opportunity to review the objectives and practice the skills to be tested set competency expectations at an agreed upon level (often 80%) manage more easily by units or small sections during the early years of schooling and by courses or semesters during high school ensure the practice with board policy "How Do You Build on What They Know"--or-- What Do They Do Instead? provide instructional options using advanced level thinking skills to extend regular curriculum provide a variety of activities in various learning styles relating to the objectives encourage student production of ideas or products to meet extended objectives keep records of process and the products of the student's extended study (a process-folio with input and evaluation from the student showing the work in progress, as well as the final product may be appropriate) grading should be based on a combination of planning, including time management, and the quality of the product.
A well-developed individual learning plan for a high-ability learner should be integrated into the regular curriculum and should extend it.
The learnings should be as a replacement and extension of the general curriculum, not in addition to it.
This plan should be based on the student's prior work (thus utilizing the process-folio) and addressing both strengths and needs.
The student should play an integral part in developing the plan, refining it during the process, assessing the learnings and the use of time and resources, and finally in developing the next plan.
The student should be given responsibilities for his/her own learning.
A well-developed individual learning plan for a highability learner should be integrated into the regular curriculum and should extend it.
Curriculum Design Standards Curriculum design is the plan for the instructional component of the gifted and talented student's program.
It includes the content, methodology, resources, and products of instruction.
Without sound curricular practices, program configurations are meaningless.
Curriculum involving gifted and talented students is the focus of these standards.
They should be applied to any class in which gifted and talented students are enrolled.
1.
Curriculum (Preschool-12) Is Articulated, Comprehensive, and Includes Substantive Scope and Sequence Curriculum that responds to the needs of gifted and talented students appears in all grades and all subject areas.
A scope and sequence plan outlining the types and progression of skills to be learned is available and consulted when making curricular decisions about individual students.
Academic Needs 43 2.
Curriculum Is Based on the Assessed Needs of Students Including the Areas of Intellectual, Emotional, Physical, Ethical, and Social Development The needs of gifted and talented students extend beyond academics.
Fullscale assessment conducted during or after identification can give instructors valuable information for curricular planning.
A student's instructional plan reflects the unique needs of the individual student.
3.
Curriculum Matches Substantive Content With the Developmental Levels of the Gifted and Talented Student Most gifted students have developmental patterns that must be taken into account when planning curriculum.
Physical, cognitive, and emotional growth are among the developmental factors that can affect how students learn and how they express what they have learned.
4.
Curriculum design is the plan for the instructional component of the gifted and talented student's program.
It includes the content, methodolog y, resources, and products of instruction.
Curriculum Incorporates Content and Experiences That Employ and Facilitate Understanding of the Latest Ideas, Principles, and Technology in a Given Content Area With rapidly changing academic fields of study, it is important that curriculum, including gifted and talented students, recognizes new ideas and is modified to reflect the changes in the form of the disciplines, how the fields are thought about and conveyed, what is important to know, and the technology used.
5.
Curriculum Provides Differentiation and Challenge for Students Through Involvement with Advanced and Rigorous Content and Procedures The content and procedures used in curriculum are compatible with the abilities of the students involved in it.
The opportunity to study content at a level commensurate with ability and achievement levels is offered to all gifted and talented students.
6.
Students Develop Critical and Creative Thinking Skills Through Instruction and Experiences Rooted in the Content Areas Skills for processing and design.
Students employ study, problem solving, areas in order to develop evaluating information are part of the curriculum such techniques as original research, independent and invention as part of their study of content these skills.
7.
Students Have Opportunities to Engage in Experiential and Interactive Learning Involving Real-Life Experiences That May Result in the Development of Sophisticated Products 44 Gifted Education Resource Guide Gifted and talented students are given the chance to become actively involved with the field they are studying.
This may include activities such as working with a professional in the field through a mentorship or internship, studying a topic in depth in the library or laboratory, or developing an original product (i.e., book, idea, plan, portfolio, etc.) and presenting it publicly.
8.
Flexible Pacing Is Employed, Allowing Students to Learn at the Pace and Level Appropriate to Their Abilities and Skills Students are given the opportunity to work at their own level and pace.
Assessment of skill levels, acceleration, skill groups, curriculum compacting, and individualization are among the methods that may be a part of the flexible pacing process.
9.
Curriculum Addresses the Attitudes and Skills Needed for Lifelong Independent Learning Gifted and talented students learn a great deal on their own.
It is vital that they be given the opportunity to develop the skills needed to become lifelong, independent learners.
10.
Specialists in Content Areas, Instructional Techniques, and Gifted Child Education Work With Curriculum Planners When Curriculum Is Being Planned and Evaluated A team approach to curriculum planning is in place to ensure that the curriculum responds to the needs of gifted students, reflects current content of practices in the academic fields, and is consistent with the goals and policies of the school district.

The assessment of the learner outcomes for highability students are no different than the best assessments for all students.
ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT LEARNING The assessment of the learner outcomes for high-ability students are no different than the best assessments for all students.
Assessment data should address: Evidence of the extent to which students use critical thinking developed within the program to modify behaviors Academic Needs 45 Evidence of students' ability to display key skills addressed by the education program Evidence of students' attitudes toward program goals Evidence of students' knowledge regarding the content and data included in the education program Program Assessment : a six-step process to curriculum improvement, Montana Office of Public Instruction, 1991.
Authentic assessment should integrate with the learning and instruction process and be a key part of that process.
Rieneke Zessoules and Howard Gardner (developer of the Theory of Multiple Intelligences) have studied assessments as a support to more effective learning and have listed six important experiences.
Authentic assessment should integrate with the learning and instruction process and be a key part of that process.
"Students are challenged to do the following: 1.
Tackle project work regularly and frequently.
These students don't create one dance phrase, write one dramatic scene, or paint one family portrait and then move on to the next unit.
They produce many works, exploring many aspects of the given discipline.
Judge their own work--not once or twice, but again and again, as it is in progress, finally completed, or in relation to earlier and later works.
Collaborate and converse with others, not as simply an interesting switch of pace, but as a critical element of working and thinking as active learners discussing, sharing, and learning from others' perceptions.
Distinguish a real audience for their work beyond the classroom teacher-- challenging them to reflect on the intent and purpose of their work.
Picture their learning and development over time again, not only at the end of the year, but also across the weeks, months, and even years of their academic careers.
Understand what it means to get better--helping them to develop and strive for standards of excellence and performance."

The Individual Learning Plan addresses the "how" you provide the needed services that your district defined in the philosophy statement.
The student assessment is based on meeting the standards outlined in the Individual Learning Plan.
The program is assessed on how well the various options available through the ILPs meet student needs.

Academic Needs 47 48 Gifted Education Resource Guide Chapter 7 Meeting Students' Social/Emotional Needs Through Program Options While academic programming is extremely important for high-ability students, support for the social and emotional aspects of maturing may be even more critical.
Research shows that bright children need help understanding their feelings and developing their self-concept.
They need to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Know how they are similar to and different from other people, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Feel pride in their abilities, rather than guilt or anxiety, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Learn how to value and accept people less able than themselves, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Own their own talents and determine how they best fit into the world, and Ã¯Â¿Â½ Belong to a group, and to the school community.
--Schmitz, Connie C. and Judy Galbraith, Managing the Social and Emotional Needs of the Gifted, Free Spirit Press, 1985.
We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality.
--Albert Einstein Discussion of these topics may be in a small group of high-ability students or with an adult.
Both should be led by someone trained in the interpersonal and intrapersonal aspects of giftedness.
Discussions and experiences should evolve around the following topics: Extra Perception The ability to have a deeper understanding and more acute awareness of physical, social and intrapersonal aspects of life.
High Involvement Because of increased sensitivity to thoughts, actions, interests and materials, there is often a frustration with those who do not exhibit the same characteristics.
Social/Emotional Needs 49 Emotional Sensitivity Super-sensitivity caused by the high degree James Alvino comments that they display "high and are quick to judge those who don't measure double standards, and other forms of logical and of perception may lead to problems.
standards of truth and morality . . . up.
They're affronted by hypocrisy, ethical contradiction."
Perfectionism While concerned with accomplishment and the pursuit of excellence, oftentimes high-ability students are unable to accept a product of "high quality" because it is not perfect.
Students need to develop criteria for their work and use that criteria for judging their accomplishments.
Uneven Integration Students may excel in mental math or story writing but do not have the ability to "get it down on paper."
This may be a real learning disability but probably can be attributed to the unevenness in the development of students' abilities.
Very few students are high in everything, and we must help them learn to cope with these differences.
For further exploration of cognitive and affective characteristics, see Growing Up Gifted, by A. Barbara Clark (second edition, pages 37-40; third edition, pages 126132).
While academic programming is extremely important for high-ability students, support for the social and emotional aspects of maturing may be even more critical.
Additional Concerns The Quality and Quantity of Giftedness As we learn more about intelligence, we are able to define it in more appropriate ways.
Howard Gardner has explored the "seven intelligences," and we must understand and address the strengths in all of these intelligences.
We must also note the differences caused by the degree of the intelligence.
A student with a very high IQ (above 150) is likely to feel more different than one with an IQ above 130.
Gifted Girls, Ethnic Minorities, Learners with Disabilities and Rural Isolation Each of these groups present particular problems which must be dealt with in order for the student to develop fully.
These are societal problems and students need both to be aware of the problems and given alternatives in order to deal with them.
We, as professionals in the field, must also make others aware and help to alleviate the conditions.
50 Gifted Education Resource Guide Resources are becoming available to help develop programs to meet the social and emotional needs of high-ability students.
This is a critical part of any well-developed program.
For more information on students' social/emotional needs: Delisle, James R., Gifted Kids Speak Out, Free Spirit Press, 1987 Galbraith, Judy, The Gifted Kids Survival Guide, Free Spirit Press, 1984 Kerr, Barbara, A Handbook for Counseling the Gifted and Talented, American Association for Counseling and Development, 1991 Schmitz, Connie C. and Judy Galbraith, Managing the Social and Emotional Needs of the Gifted, Free Spirit Press, 1985 Webb, James T., Elizabeth a Meckstroth, and Stephanie S. Tolan, Guiding the Gifted Child, Ohio Psychology Publishing Company, 1982 As we learn more about intelligence, we are able to define it in more appropriate ways.
Howard Gardner has explored the "seven intelligences," and we must understand and address the strengths in all of these intelligences.
Social/Emotional Needs 51 52 Gifted Education Resource Guide Chapter 8 Program Evaluation Evaluation is a form of disciplined inquiry, the purpose of which is to produce information to assist in making informed value judgments about a program (Carolyn Callahan, 1992 ) for the purpose of improving the program under evaluation ( James Borland, 1989).
This definition of evaluation contains several key elements which we will examine to gain an understanding of the process.
Disciplined inquiry--an exemplary evaluation shall involve a high degree of academic rigor (i.e., how you know what you know) and shall be characterized by its publicness.
Produce information to assist in making informed value judgments--the information collected shall be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program (i.e., its goodness, badness, does it work, does it not work, why, and how).
Purpose of improving the program under evaluation--the information collected shall be used for program renewal/improvement.
We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.
--T.S. Eliot What are the purposes of evaluation? What are some questions you might ask? During planning (or formative evaluation): to document the need for the program Why implement this program in the first place? to document the case for the particular program approach What makes you believe the approach you have advocated (e.g., comprehensive programming model vs. pull-out model) will work? to document the feasibility of implementing the program What makes you believe that given available resources, the program can be implemented as intended? Program Evaluation 53 While the program is in progress (formative evaluation): to document the fact the program is being implemented Does the program exist in fact as well as on paper? to assist in the identification of program strengths/weaknesses What parts of the program appear to be working and what parts appear not to be working? to generate information to assist in making in progress revisions of the program What needs to be changed and what are some alternative ways of changing it? After the program has been developed (summative evaluation): to document the results/impacts of the program in terms of: Evaluation is a form of disciplined inquiry, the purpose of which is to produce information to assist in making informed value judgments about a program (Carolyn Callahan, 1992) for the purpose of improving the program under evaluation.

Was this program worth the money? --Carolyn Callahan, 1992 54 Gifted Education Resource Guide How do you evaluate a program? Program Description This is the key piece on which the program will be evaluated.
It will provide the standard against which comparisons can be made and will provide the operational plan of the program.
Steps in Evaluating the Program Description 1.
2.
Determine the "boundary " of the program.
Give it a name, describe its general process, list its major resource conditions and major goals.
Analyze the program into 3-7 major functional components--examples include: Identification of students, program development and management, staff development, curriculum development, instruction, evaluation, etc.
Describe the major function of each, and identify the essential resource requirements, the processes or activities which happen as part of the component, and the component objectives.
Complete a finer level analysis of each component (i.e., break it into subcomponents).
Ensure that every function of the component is subsumed into one of the sub-components.
Check the comprehensiveness and logical organization of the design.
Does it represent the intended operation of the program? Are all activities of the program described? Are all of the objectives of the program stated as outcomes? 3.
It is not possible to evaluate that which you cannot describe.
--Carolyn Callahan 4.
Note: Ensure that each component is in fact a function.
A function is a process that produces outputs and consumes inputs.
--Carolyn Callahan, 1992 Who does the program evaluation? Program evaluation is always taking place on some level.
It may be by the parents in the stands during the basketball game, by the teachers in the lounge during lunch, or by the students after they have been asked to make up work they missed while being out of the room.
These are areas of concern which usually focus on one small part of a program and need to be addressed on an ongoing basis.
A summative evaluation, such as we are addressing, should be completed every 45 years or when any great change occurs.
Often an outside evaluator is invited to Program Evaluation 55 conduct the evaluation but the Steering Committee may accomplish the task.
It must be noted that this is an intense activity demanding a high degree of academic rigor and support through resources of both time and money.
The following recommendations by David M. Fetterman and the National Research Center of the Gifted and Talented may be helpful.
Make sure that the: evaluation serves the practical information needed by the targeted audiences, evaluation is realistic(politically and pragmatically) and cost-effective, evaluation is conducted in an ethical manner, evaluation is as accurate as possible, program documentation exists, review covers as many relevant data sources as possible, evaluation compares the program's stated goals with the actual performance, An evaluator is best regarded not as a judge or a referee but as "an educator (whose) success is to be judged by what others learn" --Cronbach, in Borland, 1989, p.200 57 evaluation describes and assesses the climate, evaluation includes talking to students, program finances are reviewed, and community and school board components are included in the evaluation.
Process of program development and renewal The process of program development and renewal is an ongoing cycle involving the community and its resources.
The best program is built by dedicated and concerned individuals working as a team to educate our students by integrating the best methods from the past, present and future.
This is dedication for continuous improvement.

66 Gifted Education Resource Guide Appendix D Glossary of Terms Academically Gifted--an individual who possesses a specific academic talent in one or more areas, but not necessarily all areas.
Acceleration--the practice of allowing students to progress through the curriculum at a more advanced rate than normal.
Grade skipping, specific subject acceleration, honors classes, advanced placement classes and early college entrance may be utilized to accelerate a student's pace in the curriculum.
Advanced Placement--high school classes with a curriculum designed to be at a level comparable to college classes.
Students who pass the AP exam are awarded college credit while still in high school.
Cluster Grouping--the practice of placing students of similar abilities in groups for the delivery of instruction in the classroom.
Compacting--the practice of determining a student's advancement through the curriculum by determining current strengths and then placing the student according to need.
Compacting is designed to relieve boredom that results from not being challenged and to "buy" the student time to pursue accelerated or enrichment activities.
Comprehensive District Plan--a locally developed plan for gifted education at all grade levels in the district which includes (MCA 20-7-904 and Montana Accreditation Standard 10.55.804): Ã¯Â¿Â½ identification of talent areas and student selection criteria according to a written program philosophy, Ã¯Â¿Â½ program description that is internally consistent with the philosophy, identification and definition, which includes stated needs and measurable objectives designed to meet those needs, Ã¯Â¿Â½ evidence that the activities are appropriate and will serve to achieve the program objectives, Ã¯Â¿Â½ a curriculum which reflects student needs, Ã¯Â¿Â½ teacher preparation/staff inservice, Ã¯Â¿Â½ criteria for formative and summative evaluation, Ã¯Â¿Â½ supportive services, Ã¯Â¿Â½ parent involvement.
Concurrent Enrollment--the practice of allowing students to enroll at college while they are still enrolled in high school.
Often college credit is allowed to count for graduation requirements from high school.
Appendix D 67 Distance Learning--the use of satellite or computer network technology in student instruction.
Early Entrance to Kindergarten--allows students to enter kindergarten at an age earlier than normal.
Enrichment--experiences or activities that are above or beyond the regular curriculum.

Grade Skipping--the practice of placing high-ability students a full grade level above their chronological placement.
Honors Classes--high-level classes taught at the high school to students who are placed in homogeneous groups of high-ability students.
Independent Study--a planned approach in which students employ research techniques, assimilate information and report on present findings, conclusions and/or solutions in topical areas of personal interest.
Intellectually Gifted--an individual who has high abilities in a variety of areas.
This person usually possesses an excellent memory and easily processes new, as well as large, amounts of information.
Mentorships--students work with a person who is an expert in the area of study in order to encourage and nurture the students' abilities and interests.
This work may be scheduled outside the class, school or as released time from the regular program.
Multiple Criteria--the uses of more than one source of information when selecting students for participation in programs for the gifted.
The use of multiple criteria helps to overcome the limitations and bias of any one source of information and provides greater insight into the potential gifts and talents of individual students and their concomitant needs.
Resource Room/Pull-Out/Send-Out--a designated room reserved for special program activities.
Students are pulled-out/sent-out to this room for special programming.
Regular Classroom Plan--the direction of a student's program is determined by modifications being made by regular classroom teachers in regular content areas.
Complementary enrichment activities may be a part of this approach.
Self-Contained Classes--the full-time grouping of gifted students for instruction in a class or classes within a school building.
68 Gifted Education Resource Guide Appendix E Brief Hints for Proposal Writers Kathleen Mollohan State Gifted and Talented Program Educational Opportunity and Equity Division Montana Office of Public Instruction Linda McCulloch, Superintendent December 2001 Writing proposals for funding is not really difficult.
Your challenge is to communicate your good ideas to others.
These brief hints may help you get over some of the hurdles as you write your proposal.
They are based on the most crucial elements of any proposal: determining and proving a need, writing measurable objectives, and evaluating the effectiveness of the project.
PLANNING Any proposal for funding, whether for a single activity or a multi-faceted project, must be based on a clear plan of action.
If the plan is well conceived, the proposal will be easy to write.
When planning, 1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
ask yourself: What is the problem or need I wish to address? What do I want to accomplish? What steps must be taken, by whom, and when? How much will the project cost? How will I know if the project was successful? Those questions form the outline of the proposal, and the answers supply the content.
The content is composed of basic elements, usually identified as: 1.
Statement of need 2.
Goals and objectives 3.
Activities 4.
Budget 5.
Evaluation plan DETERMINING NEED A proposal for funding must be a response to a need.
Usually it is a need for change from one condition to a better condition.
Even if the proposal does not call for you to state your needs, you must define them for yourself as the basis for creating your objectives.
The statement of need should include a description of the problem and documentation that the problem exists.
Documentation should consist of statistical evidence or a review of the literature on the topic.
Appendix E 69 SAMPLE NEEDS STATEMENT: "A self-assessment of teacher confidence in meeting the needs of students was conducted in the district this year.
While the district used multiple criteria for identifying gifted students, teachers reported that they were unsure of all the ways to measure these students' current level of achievement and, thus, were not confident they were providing the appropriate instructional programs to meet the educational needs of individual students.
The district's priority of providing an appropriate education to all students was not being met.
The district proposes to improve its gifted student needs assessment and instruction by sending a gifted and talented team to an intensive training institute on this topic."
As you will see later, the district's objective is not to train teachers.
That is just the strategy.
Their objective is to ensure gifted students' needs are being met.
WRITING MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES Although you may have a clear idea what will happen during the project period, it may be difficult to state your objectives.
The objective must indicate the outcome expected as a solution to the defined need or problem.
An objective must also state your criteria for success, which simply means it states how much and what kind of change or improvement you expect the project to produce.
In the sample above, the problem is that teachers feel they are not able to determine the actual needs of gifted students in order to provide the appropriate instruction.
The measurable objective would try to reverse that situation.
The essential part of your measurable objective could be stated like this: ". . . gifted students will receive appropriate instruction based on a determination of their academic needs . . ."
To be convincing you also need to show your need, your criteria for success, and your basic strategy.
A well-written objective also states the method of testing or measuring the outcome.
Say, for example, your district has decided it would be reasonable to expect that 95 percent of the gifted students will receive a more appropriate education than they were currently receiving (your criteria for success).
Now you must decide what you will need to do to make this change.
Based on current and anticipated resources, research, best practice, policy, legal requirements and other factors, you determine a strategy to accomplish your objective.
Your strategy could be intensive professional development which focuses on 1) methods of testing for current achievement levels, 2) methods of assessment to determine academic need, and 3) teaching strategies for meeting individual student needs.
Let's see if we can state the objective with what we have so far: "A 1999 districtwide teacher self-assessment revealed that gifted teachers lacked confidence that they were meeting the needs of individual gifted students.
The district's objective is to make sure that at least 95 percent of identified gifted students are receiving an appropriate instruction based on a determination of their academic needs.
The district's strateg y for meeting this objective is for three members of the gifted and talented team to attend a highly regarded gifted education teacher training institute in order to learn 1) the best methods of testing for current achievement levels, 2) methods of assessment to determine academic need, and 3) teaching strategies for meeting individual student needs.
70 Gifted Education Resource Guide Measures of the success of this approach will include: 1.
student academic advancement as measured by teacher-made and portfolio assessments.
student and parent questionnaires which reveal satisfaction with adjustments to the instructional program, and teacher follow-up self-assessment which reveals confidence in providing appropriate instruction."

Now you have stated your need, measurable objective, criterion for success, the strategy for accomplishing your objective, and a way to evaluate whether or not you were successful.
WHAT GOES WRONG? A common mistake in writing an objective is to refer to an activity instead of the desired outcome.
SAMPLE POOR OBJECTIVE: The objective of this proposal is to establish a parent newsletter so that the parents of gifted students are routinely and frequently involved in their child's education.
Why is this a poor objective? Remember, objectives are specific and state the expected results in measurable terms.
Although you can "measure" whether or not you established a newsletter, grantors are more interested in the extent to which parents are actually involved in their child's education, and whether or not the child's school experience is better because of that involvement.
Remember, too, that the grantors look for the validity and quality of what you are doing.
They may point out that sending out a newsletter, while having the potential to inform parents, is not necessarily a good vehicle to solicit their actual involvement.
Objectives should be specific, answering the questions WHO? WHAT? WHEN? and HOW MUCH? Who will benefit from the project? What should occur? When will the change happen? How much change must occur to prove the project's success? Avoid vague and unmeasurable words in writing objectives.
The following words and phrases practically guarantee objectives that will cause problems: appreciate enjoy be aware of realize expose to Another pitfall in writing objectives is to begin with phrases such as: to provide to impart to to instill in to work with to develop to enhance Appendix E 71 If you complete each of the above phrases, you will end up not with a measurable objective, but an activity that is only a step toward your true objective.
You can put the objective to the test by asking, "Why bother?" The answer to that question is probably the basis of your true objective.
By far the most common complaint about proposal objectives is that the applicant does not distinguish between what is to be accomplished (the objective) and what activities will take place (the strategies to reach the objective).
To turn the poor objective in the above sample into a true measurable objective, you might state it this way: "Research shows that parent involvement is an important factor in the child's successful school experience.
The objective of this proposal is to more closely align instruction to students' needs by increasing meaning ful involvement of those students' parents.
As a result of a multi-faceted district strateg y of routinely and frequently involving parents in their child's instructional program, at least 50 percent of these students and their parents will report improved school experiences.
The strateg y will include: 1.
2.
a regular newsletter to provide general information about the gifted program, regularly scheduled parent/teacher meetings to plan and review the student's instructional program, a structured process for reporting student progress and making program adjustments, and a plan to use parent volunteers in activities and projects.
3.
4.
This approach will be deemed successful if parents and students report satisfaction with the instructional program, as measured by a student and parent questionnaire administered during the first month of the project period, and again at the end of the project period."
This objective clearly states a desired outcome.
I shows what will be done, when it will be done, and how it will be measured.
How it will be measured IS the evaluation scheme! EVALUATION Ideally, a project's evaluation scheme will be build into the project design: you know in advance what you want to accomplish and what constitutes success.
Well-written objectives do this for you.
You are in the best position to decide how to test or measure the degree and quality of the change you anticipate.
That is the essence of evaluation, whether the evaluation design is simple or complex.
A proposal may have an evaluation scheme that sounds sophisticated but, because the objectives are not measurable, is meaningless.
By definition, evaluation cannot be applied after the fact.
If you know the results you want, you must have some idea in the beginning how you will be able to tell if you were successful.
That is why writing measurable objectives is so important.
A well-written objective states the criteria for success and states the method of testing or measuring.
72 Gifted Education Resource Guide In assessing the effectiveness of your program, you are usually asked for your formative and summative evaluation strategy.
Don't panic, and don't run off and copy someone else's important-sounding document.
Certainly, you should study guides that help you determine what you should measure and how you can collect the data, but essentially it boils down to this: FORMATIVE EVALUATION means you continually assess whether your strategy is working the way you want it to, and SUMMATIVE EVALUATION means you look at whether, in the end, your project did what you set out to do.
SUMMARY In summary, the grantor wants to know how effective the project is likely to be.
The grantor can estimate the value of the project if: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ it is the the the designed to meet a need or solve a problem, technique used has a good chance of bringing about the desired change, quality and quantity of the change can be measured, and results can be documented.
