9 Will You Vote? Grades 5-12 Subjects Civics - History - Language Arts Goals/Rationale Voting is an essential part of a democracy.
Unfortunately, voter turnout among young people is at an all-time low.
While young people today are not alone in their political apathy, they may be the ones to change this trend.
In an effort to help students understand the importance of voting, this lesson will show students the history of the vote, including the obstacles many dedicated activists had to overcome in order for our electorate to be truly representative of ALL, regardless of race, religion, gender, etc.
Voting is such a powerful act that throughout history people have been stopped from voting.
In recent years, the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) sponsored and produced a revealing study entitled New Millennium Project: American Youth Attitudes on Politics, Citizenship, Government, and Voting.
The results in the report are not necessarily surprising, but they are indeed startling.
Defined as "the problem," this study states: Y Y Since 18 year olds were first given the chance to exercise their right to vote in the 1972 elections, the voter turnout rate of 18 to 24 year olds has steadily declined.
In 1972, 50% of 18 to 24 year olds exercised their right to vote.
By the 1996 elections, only 32% of 18 to 24 year olds turned out at the polls.
Turnout among this age group in 1998 is projected to have been below 20%, perhaps the lowest in our nation's history.
Even with changes that have made voter registration easier, only half (49%) of 18 to 24 year olds were registered to vote in 1996.
We know that young people either DON'T vote or consistently DON'T show up at the polls on election day.
It is our mission to try to alter this mind set.

19 THE POWER OF PRINT ACTIVITY #3 The media has long been a powerful tool for communication about elections and issues.
The newspaper has been in existence longer than others (television and radio) and still is one of the most trusted and used in election year decision making.
The media plays an important role in communication about candidates and their backgrounds and issues facing the community, state and nation.
The newspaper is often thought of as the best resource for tangible, detailed information about the local, state and national elections and issues.
Y Y Y Use one edition of your newspaper to find examples, prior to the election, of the type of information the newspaper contains about candidates, issues, the voting process or anything that you think had to do with the elections.
Clip each example, as you search in your newspaper for stories, cartoons, advertising, charts, photos, comics, editorials, etc.
Put all of the information you have clipped in a folder or envelope and write on the outside of the envelope how much time you estimate it will take you to read all the information you clipped.
On your own, read the information clipped from the newspaper and record your reading time below: Newspaper Reading Time Begin:_____________ End:_____________ Y Y Watch one national or local television news broadcast for 30 minutes and keep (on a separate sheet of paper) a record of the election information featured in the broadcast Below: list what you think are the advantages/disadvantages of each form of media (television and newspaper) in election coverage.

29 A POLITICAL PICTURE ACTIVITY #5 In the space allotted below, create a "political picture" of yourself.
Now that you have studied about campaigns, candidates, elections and issues, this is your chance to reflect your political personality.
By evaluating where you stand on the issues, you should be able to decide which political party's ideals you come closest in attitude and in what ways you may differ from present members of this particular party A POLITICAL PROFILE OF_______________________________ (Your Name) Y Describe how you feel about three or four national issues Y Describe the platform of the party which has ideas similar to yours Y Explain what political party you would support in the coming election and give five reasons for your support 30 POLITICAL PARTY PLATFORMS ACTIVITY #6 Political party platforms outline the principles and recommendations of the party on a variety of issues.
The platforms contain "planks" (positions on specific subjects) that might benefit or disappoint different groups of people Y Y Read the Democratic and Republican Party platforms.
Also, read the platform presented by a third party or independent candidate.
The highlights of each party's platform can usually be found in your daily newspaper around the time of a national convention or during the month of the election Decide which platform appeals to you the most.
Do you have any special concerns not addressed in any of the platforms.
Democratic Party Platform Highlights Republican Party Platform Highlights Other Party Platform Highlights Your Concerns 31 ALL TOGETHER NOW ACTIVITY #7 As citizens, we study issues and candidates to make what we feel are the best decisions.
Often candidates we think we might vote for may not take the exact stand that we would want them to take on certain issues.
We often vote for the "best fit" candidates that come closest to our expectations in governmental leadership.
We may know what issues our country and community must face and we may be aware of the background of each of the candidates running for public office, but we must be informed about where the candidates and the issues come together.
Newspapers can help inform citizens about where candidates stand on certain issues, but citizens must make the final decision.
Y Y Y Y In the chart provided, list the major issues facing the nation this election year.
In the column at the left, identify candidates running for office at the federal, state or local level.
Use information from your local newspaper to find out where each candidate stands on the issues you listed.
Complete your chart by briefly identifying your stand on the issues.
ALL TOGETHER NOW Issues: Candidate Your Position 32 WHERE DO I STAND? ACTIVITY #8 The thoughts, concerns and attitudes of individuals throughout the nation are expressed daily in the newspaper- news events coverage, editorials, letters, photos and even advertisements and comics.
Historically, election day is the day in which individuals have their chance to speak out by going to the polls and expressing their views by voting for or against candidates and issues.
Though not everyone can win on election day, the opportunity to speak freely through action is an important part of our democracy Y Y Y Use your newspaper to identify certain candidates and issues voted on during this election year.
List the names of two candidates and identify two issues from the newspaper that you feel strongly about (you may not like the way things turned out in the election, but you still get a chance to have the last word on these candidates and issues) In the area provided below, summarize your thoughts and feelings about each issue and each candidate you identified.

If possible, have their local mayor or alderman come in to discuss this process with them.
The class will then brainstorm what offices they feel are important to have in their classroom Materials: Posterboard of many colors, markers, scissors, button materials, colored paper, lined paper, examples of speeches and advertisements, tape, ticky-tack.
Description 1.
Students will sign up for the office(s) that they wish to run for.
2.
Then students who do not wish to run may then divide into campaign groups.
These groups will be developing a platform for their candidate to run on.
3.
Students will use examples of local campaign paraphernalia to develop their ideas for buttons and posters.
35 4.
Students may begin posting their signs and wearing their buttons during the second week.
5.
During this second week, students may have their campaign group present 30 second/one minute commercials at the end of the day on Wednesday and Friday.
6.
Focusing on the issues of their campaign platform, students in each group will work with the candidate to write a speech that the candidate will present in front of the class during the week of voting.
Closure: During the final week candidates will give their final speeches on Monday afternoon.
On Wednesday, each student will cast their ballot into the ballot box.
The votes will be tallied by the teacher and offices will be announced on Friday.
Assessment: Students will turn in a peer evaluation forms of their group.
The teacher may use a checklist involving the criteria: cooperation, campaign paraphernalia, quality of speech drafts, etc.
Students could choose actual political candidates from a time period in history and create their platform for them.
They could either use the issues that they ran on or create those that they feel would have been significant then.
36 Inviting Candidates to Class Grades 9-12* * Adapted from AskERIC Lesson Plan submitted by Ronald W. Ryckman, teacher, Kansas Subjects: Social Studies/US Government Goal/Rationale: The purpose of having candidates speak is to show that politicians are people and that the students are old enough to decide who they want to represent them in the legislature.
The best citizen is the best informed one.

2.
Carry on a more intelligent conversation with others about the candidates and the issues.
3.
Understand more the power of the vote and why there are different views on the some issues.
37 4.
See that candidates are real people whom they can talk to.
This should make it easier for students to write or call them to express a concern when a candidate gets elected.
Materials: The candidate must be contacted to speak and must be told to have mostly question and answer time.
Students need access to newspapers and registration/voting sheets for the polling.
Description: 1.
Before the candidates speak to the class, the students contact parents, friends, neighbors, other teachers, administrators, and staff for information about the candidates and/or issues.
Students then compile a list of questions.
2.
Students make an election notebook from newspaper clippings, magazines, and campaign literature.
After the election, the students turn in the notebooks with the major issues written down, the results of the election, and their opinion as to why someone would vote for the candidates.
3.
A student will videotape the candidate's 15-minute speech and 45-minute question and answer time.
This tape is shown over the TV cable channel and a copy is given to each candidate.
4.
Students volunteer to conduct a phone survey of registered voters in the parish.
The poll is conducted one night, the results tabulated and sent to the candidates, local newspapers, and the Republican and Democratic headquarters 5.
Students are encouraged to campaign for any candidate.
It could be in the form of passing out literature or stuffing envelopes to conduct surveys.
6.
Students tape TV ads and show them to class.
They look for name calling, rumor mongering, loaded statements, guilt by association, catchwords, baiting, passing the blame, and evading real issues.
They are asked what they learned about the candidate from the ad.
How important was the setting and script? Was it aimed at a certain group? 7.
Students run a mock election for the school and publicize the results.
8.
Students encourage get-out-to-vote drive for eligible students.
9.
We have an election night party at the teacher's house or school and call the election center for local results.
10.
Students write why they thought each candidate won Assessment: Many students do not know their state legislators or the candidates running for office.
They do not understand the power of being informed and the influence they can have on an election.
38 When visiting the state capitol and meeting representatives, discuss with them the issues and lobby our position on the issues.
Discuss some reasons for people not voting and how valid are the reasons? What can be done to help encourage higher voter participation? 39 Extra Classroom Activities Y Y Y Y Y Tour the We the People Exhibit at Louisiana's Old State Capitol (Activity #9 attached) Study tactics and political strategies used to sway voters Design buttons, posters, pamphlets, TV and radio jingles to promote voting or a candidate Conduct poster or essay contests based on the election, a candidate, or an issue.
