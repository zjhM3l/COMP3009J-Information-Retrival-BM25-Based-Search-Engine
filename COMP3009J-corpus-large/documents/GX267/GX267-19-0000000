-- John F. Kennedy EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In recent years, different constituencies have raised a number of issues regarding gifted education services.
Teachers have raised issues related to the identification of gifted students and appropriate training.
Local administrators have raised issues related to eligibility criteria, administrative costs in time and energy, efficiency, and services to intellectual gifted students.
Parents have raised issues of educational planning and access to advanced educational services.
All groups have been interested in improving the integration and coordination of general and special education to better meet the needs of our intellectually gifted students.
In response to these concerns, the Tennessee General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution 75, which created The Intellectually Gifted Students Joint Study Committee.
Representatives Maddox and Hood sponsored HJR 75, which was signed by the Governor on June 11, 2003.
Three professional/advocacy groups mutually endorsed HJR 75: the Tennessee Association of Administrators of Special Education (TAASE), the Tennessee Association for the Gifted (TAG), and the Tennessee Initiative for Gifted Education Reform (TIGER).
These groups represent, respectively, administrators, teachers, and parents.
HJR 75 directed the Committee to examine and make recommendations for changes in State Board of Education rules and regulations in five interrelated areas: 1.
2.
3.
4.
Improving and clarifying eligibility criteria for intellectually gifted students.
Improving education planning for intellectually gifted students, as well as streamlining procedures and reducing paperwork related to Individualized Education Programs.
Making evaluation and reevaluation methods and procedures more efficient and more appropriate for intellectually gifted students.
Increasing the likelihood that the needs of intellectually gifted students are addressed and met in regular K-12 classrooms, and that students have easier access to advanced instruction in higher grades and in post-secondary school settings.
Providing pre-service, in-service, and advanced teacher training regarding the needs of intellectually gifted students.
5.
The Joint Study Committee met throughout the Fall of 2003, taking public input, reviewing research and available data, sharing personal experiences, and discussing policy options.
There is ii. . a shared consensus that the following recommendations will strengthen, improve, and streamline services for intellectually gifted students in Tennessee: Recommendation 1.1 The State Board of Education request the Department of Education to establish a Task Force for Intellectually Gifted with a representative from the State Board of Education to review the state guidelines and standards established for determining program eligibility criteria, evaluation procedures, and evaluation participants according to Rule 0520-19-.07.
This Task Force would study the following areas and report to the State Board of Education by May 2005: 1) 2) 3) revise or replace the Teacher Observation Checklist and the Teacher Creativity Checklist; establish criteria for preschool identification and determination of need; determine the guidelines as to the most appropriate grade levels for screening for intellectually gifted while allowing for flexibility for testing at an age appropriate for a given student; develop a clear "adversely affects" standard which is appropriate to intellectually gifted students and their needs; review the eligibility criteria in relation to the use of a variety of intelligence tests, their new norms, and their uses to identify subpopulations of gifted students including highly gifted, minority gifted, and gifted with dual diagnoses.
4) 5) Recommendation 2.1: The State Board of Education request the Department of Education to develop and maintain a research-based Best Practices Manual for Intellectually Gifted.
Such Manual should include a menu of appropriate goals and objectives for use in gifted IEPs, and a model gifted education curriculum keyed to the minimum program standards (e.g. program standards of the National Association for Gifted Children).
The Department of Education will present the Best Practices Manual for Intellectually Gifted to the State Board of Education by February 1, 2005.
Recommendation 3.1 : Add subparagraph (a) to rule 0520-1-9-.05 (6) so it reads: Each local school system shall ensure that an individual evaluation of each child eligible for special education is conducted every three (3) years or more frequently if conditions warrant or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.
(a) Intellectually gifted students in grades 7-12 are excluded from reevaluation rule 0520-19-.05 (6) unless requested by any member of the IEP team.
Recommendation 4.1: The State Board of Education request the State Department of Education include the disaggregated data on academic achievement and progress for students identified as intellectually gifted by state eligibility criteria in the annual publication, Tennessee Student Test Results, Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program beginning in 2004.

INTRODUCTION Intellectually Gifted" means a child whose intellectual abilities and potential for achievement are so outstanding that special provisions are required to meet the child's educational needs.
- Tenn.
Admin.
Rules, State Board of Education, 0520-1-9-.01(15)(h)) In all school districts there are children who have the potential of learning at a lev is significantly above the ability of their same age peers.
Many of these educational interventions to help them move forward academically and to help concomitant problems associated with spending much of their day in classrooms not academically challenged.
el and pace that children need them avoid the where they are The State of Tennessee has recognized the importance and responsibility of identifying and meeting the unique needs of intellectually gifted students for over three decades.
In 1972, the Tennessee General Assembly passed the Weldon Act (Tennessee Public Acts of 1972, Chapter 839), which defined intellectual giftedness as a handicapping condition in state law and required that all handicapped children receive a "free education appropriate to their needs."
This year nearly twenty thousand intellectually gifted school children in Tennessee are identified and receive needed interventions and services.
These students represent a cross section of cultural groups, regions, and income levels, and they attend schools in our largest cities and smallest towns.
State law provides a foundation for addressing the needs of intellectually gifted students, but improvements are needed in several areas.
It is the aim and purpose of The Intellectually Gifted Students Joint Study Committee to propose changes to Tennessee State Board of Education rules and regulations that will strengthen, improve, and streamline the identification, educational planning and services for these students.
In recent years, different constituencies have raised a number of issues regarding gifted education services.
Teachers have raised issues related to the identification of gifted students and appropriate training.
Local administrators have raised issues related to eligibility criteria, administrative costs in time and energy, efficiency, and services to intellectual gifted students.
Parents have raised issues of educational planning and access to advanced educational services.
All groups have been interested in improving the integration and coordination of general and special education to better meet the needs of our intellectually gifted students.
In response to these concerns, the Tennessee General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution 75, which created The Intellectually Gifted Students Joint Study Committee.
Representatives Maddox and Hood sponsored HJR 75, which was signed by the Governor on June 11, 2003, (Appendix A).
Three professional/advocacy groups mutually endorsed HJR 75: the Tennessee Association of Administrators of Special Education (TAASE), the Tennessee Association for the 1.
.
Gifted (TAG), and the Tennessee Initiative for Gifted Education Reform (TIGER).
These groups represent, respectively, administrators, teachers, and parents.
HJR 75 directed the Committee to examine and make recommendations for changes in State Board of Education rules and regulations in five interrelated areas: 1.
2.
3.
4.
Improving and clarifying eligibility criteria for intellectually gifted students.
Improving education planning for intellectually gifted students, as well as streamlining procedures and reducing paperwork related to Individualized Education Programs.
Making evaluation and reevaluation methods and procedures more efficient and more appropriate for intellectually gifted students.
Increasing the likelihood that the needs of intellectually gifted students are addressed and met in regular K-12 classrooms, and that students have easier access to advanced instruction in higher grades and in post-secondary school settings.
Providing pre-service, in-service, and advanced teacher training regarding the needs of intellectually gifted students.

The Joint Study Committee met throughout the Fall of 2003, taking public input, reviewing research and available data, sharing personal experiences, and discussing policy options.
There is a shared consensus that the recommendations enumerated in this report will, in very practical ways, strengthen, improve, and streamline services for intellectually gifted students in Tennessee.
The report proceeds in several stages.
The following section addresses each of the five areas mandated by HJR 75 individually, providing a narrative of the issues discussed, findings, and specific recommendations for improvement.
A summary of these recommendations are listed in the next section followed by the conclusion.
Appendices provide information on relevant resources and references.
2.
.
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The Committee examined each of the five mandated study areas separately, discussing areas of concern and possible improvement, reviewing policy options, and reaching consensus on areas of recommendation.
These discussions for each area are not necessarily concerns held by every member of the committee.
Only the recommendations have the consensus of the full committee.
The issues in the five areas tend to overlap or impact one another and, as a result, many Committee recommendations address two or more of the mandated study areas.
In the interest of brevity and clarity, the recommendations are not repeated in each and every area in which they might be fitted.
Rather, each recommendation is presented just once, under the area with which it is most closely related.
1.
The intel they The (1) Improving and clarifying eligibility criteria for intellectually gifted students.
Committee heard and expressed a variety of concerns about the current eligibility criteria for lectually gifted children.
Children are eligible for an IEP and special educational services if meet the criteria for identification and need for services.
evaluation process leading to a determination of a child's eligibility has several steps: Screening: All children must be screened once in el Department of Education policy.
In addition, a parent, student in any grade for screening.
From the data recommendation is made for a comprehensive evaluation ementary school, according to teacher, or student may refer a gathered during screening, a or for no further assessment.
(2) Identification: A comprehensive evaluation includes testing or evaluation in the areas of Cognition or IQ, Achievement, Academic Performance, and Creative Thinking.
Using all assessment data, the IEP team applies a "four-option" formula for determining whether a student is identified as intellectually gifted.
In the first option, a very high score on a Cognition test is required, but in the other options the required Cognition score decreases while required scores in other assessment areas increase.
A student must qualify under at least one option to be considered for eligibility.
Determination of need for services: The IEP team uses the assessment data and all relevant information to determine if a child identified as intellectually gifted is eligible for services.
Children are eligible for services only if their intellectual abilities "adversely affect" their education performance in the regular curriculum.
(3) Members of the Committee expressed concerns about all phases of this process, which is defined in Department policy.
Regarding the screening process, some members believe that schools are not screening early enough.
It was felt that schools often wait until the third or fourth grade to screen students using TCAP scores and that many students are missed by not screening earlier, especially children in poverty who may experience a drop in achievement in the early years.
Early screening is important for all students since habits related to underachievement are often developed in the early years.
Alternatively, some Committee members expressed real concern about the financial and administrative costs of earlier screening.
3.
.
Concerns were expressed about the comprehensive assessment.
Many felt that the checklists commonly used in the Academic Performance and Creativity categories were too subjective or not valid.
In particular, the Teacher Observation Checklist and the Creative Thinking Checklist were questioned for their use, reliability, and validity.
Some felt that assessment procedures for preschool children should be clarified and made age-appropriate.
There was much discussion about the current use of intelligence tests for gifted students, and whether current best practices and procedures are being consistently applied across the state.
There was concern that the current identification criteria are too complex and too broad, and a minimum Cognition score should be used.
Finally, there was broad agreement that the criteria used to determine need for services should be significantly improved.
The Committee spent much time discussing the primary criterion used to determine need for services, which is the "adversely affects" standard.
According to Rule 0520-1-9-.01, "'adversely affects' means when a child's disability significantly impacts progress in the general curriculum."
The Committee received public input on this issue and itself believes that that the definition of "adversely affects" is too subjective and is applied quite differently throughout the state.
With respect to subjectivity, it is perceived that determinations are often dependent on the particular school district and/or who is on the IEP team rather than clear, objective standards.
Even if test data show large cognitive or achievement differences from the norm or the child exhibits concomitant problems, it is sometimes difficult to secure services unless there is a significant lack of "progress in the general curriculum."
Since the gifted child may have already mastered much of the grade-level regular curriculum before the start of school, the "adversely affects" standard as it is currently defined can be used to hold a student back.
The main source of the problem is that the current definition of "adversely affects" is a construct that is difficult to apply to students at both ends of the learning spectrum.
The potential adverse effect for intellectually gifted students is not a lack of progress in the general curriculum, but that the general curriculum neither challenges nor allows progress for the student.
When the "adversely affects" construct is applied as a determination of need to intellectually gifted students, it often limits students to grade level expectations and inappropriate learning environments.
The current definition of "adversely affects" in not consistent with the purpose of identifying gifted students, who are by definition, those students who have the potential of learning at a level beyond the regular curriculum.
The Committee made no recommendations regarding specific changes to eligibility criteria or identification procedures.
However, the committee concluded that the problems are significant and should be thoroughly addressed by the Department of Education in consultation with the State Board of Education.
Recommendation 1.1: The State Board of Education request the Department of Education to establish a Task Force for Intellectually Gifted with a representative from the State Board of Education to review the state guidelines and standards established for determining program eligibility criteria, evaluation procedures, and evaluation participants according to Rule 0520-1- 4.
.
9-.07.
This Task Force would study the following areas and report to the State Board of Education by May 2005: 1) 2) 3) revise or replace the Teacher Observation Checklist and the Teacher Creativity Checklist; establish criteria for preschool identification and determination of need; determine the guidelines as to the most appropriate grade levels for screening for intellectually gifted while allowing for flexibility for testing at an age appropriate for a given student; develop a clear "adversely affects" standard which is appropriate to intellectually gifted students and their needs; review the eligibility criteria in relation to the use of a variety of intelligence tests, their new norms, and their uses to identify subpopulations of gifted students including highly gifted, minority gifted, and gifted with dual diagnoses.
Improving education planning for intellectually gifted students, as well as streamlining procedures and reducing paperwork related to Individualized Education Programs.
4) 5) 2.
Provision of appropriate services for intellectually gifted students entails administrative costs for Local Education Agencies--meetings, staff time, and completion of necessary assessments, evaluations, and IEP documents.
As with all public services, it is important to make these processes as efficient as possible.
The goal is to streamline the processes while maintaining needed information, planning, and protections.
The Committee's mandate links improved educational planning with the reduction of administrative overhead.
Sound planning of appropriate services for a child minimizes problems throughout a school year, and so minimizes the meetings and staff time and paperwork associated with addressing those problems.
Good educational planning thus is a route to reduced administrative cost.
In this area, four issues were addressed by the Committee: data on gifted student progress, a best practices manual for LEA use, flexibility in amending IEP's and the definition and application of "Adversely Affects".
Data on Gifted Student Progress.
Data is currently collected on both academic achievement and progress of all students, but it is not currently disaggregated for the sub-population of students identified as intellectually gifted.
The committee has suggested specific language for improved data collection, see Recommendation 4.1.
Best Practices Manual.
Crafting IEPs appropriate for intellectually gifted students can be quite different from those written for other student populations.
Different types of issues arise, 5.
. different services are needed, and different goals and objectives are required.
Many LEAs and staff have limited experience with gifted IEPs, and so crafting a solid IEP for an intellectually gifted student can mean added administrative time and effort.
Provision of a sound, researchbased Best Practices Manual would thus help LEAs, both improving planning and streamlining the process.
Such a manual ought to include a model gifted education curriculum and a menu of appropriate goals and objectives for LEAs to use in writing IEPs for gifted students.
Recommendation 2.1: The State Board of Education request the Department of Education to develop and maintain a research-based Best Practices Manual for Intellectually Gifted.
Such Manual should include a menu of appropriate goals and objectives for use in gifted IEPs, and a model gifted education curriculum keyed to the minimum program standards (e.g. program standards of the National Association for Gifted Children).
The Department of Education will present the Best Practices Manual for Intellectually Gifted to the State Board of Education by February 1, 2005.
Flexibility with IEP Process.
Finally, the Committee discussed adding flexibility to the IEP process.
Currently, IEPs must be written annually, and all changes to an IEP, however minor, require a full team meeting, involving staff and administrative time.
The committee made no recommendation to change this procedure because some school districts did not want to create a dual system for IEPs.
A second system could create more paperwork and time than the time eliminated by streamlining the current IEP process.
The committee was aware that IDEA is in the process of reauthorization and some paperwork special education requirements may be modified in the near future.
Adversely Affects.
This definition is discussed at length under the first study area, and the recommendation to review this construct can be found in Recommendation 1.1.
3.
Making evaluation and reevaluation methods and procedures more efficient and more appropriate for intellectually gifted students.
Evaluation and reevaluation methods and procedures are closely related to eligibility criteria.
The committee listened to feedback and discussed in length about the pros and cons of requiring a minimum cognition score as part of the evaluation procedure.
There was also a concern for the administration and application of the new versions of intelligence tests, specifically Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition (SB-V) and Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children.
There are new interpretive manuals and norms for both tests.
The publishers of the SB-V strongly recommend using the procedures outlined in their Assessment Service Bulletin #3 for accurately assessing high abilities in children (Ruff, 2003).
Some members of the committee believed state manuals should clarify the variety of cognitive assessments available for all students.
The committee also discussed the definition of "adversely affects" and possible change in the definition.
Lastly, a recommendation to eliminate unnecessary three-year reevaluations of older students identified as intellectually gifted is listed below.
IQ tests.
See Recommendation 1.1 which asks the Task Force to review the use of a variety of the current intelligence tests in relationship to eligibility criteria.
6.
.
Adversely Affects.
This definition is discussed at length under the first study area and the recommendation to review this construct can be found in Recommendation 1.1.
Three-year Reevaluations for Grades 7-12.
Three-year reevaluations for intellectually gifted students in grades 7-12 are expensive, time consuming for students and staff, and are often irrelevant at these grade levels.
The committee believes that this requirement is an unnecessary burden on school systems and students.
It recommends that intellectually gifted students be exempted from this reevaluation requirement in grades 7-12 with the provision for a reevaluation if deemed necessary by the school system, parent, or any member of the IEP team.
Recommendation 3.1: Add subparagraph (a) to rule 0520-1-9-.05 (6) so it reads: Each local school system shall ensure that an individual evaluation of each child eligible for special education is conducted every three (3) years or more frequently if conditions warrant or if the child's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.
(a) Intellectually gifted students in grades 7-12 are excluded from reevaluation rule 0520-1-9-.05 (6) unless requested by any member of the IEP team.
4.
Increasing the likelihood that the needs of intellectually gifted students are addressed and met in regular K-12 classrooms, and that students have easier access to advanced instruction in higher grades and in post-secondary school settings.
It is essential that general and special education work together to meet the needs of intellectually gifted children; even when a gifted student receives special services, he/she will spend most of the school day in the regular K-12 classroom.
The extent to which students have access to advanced and challenging instruction in the general education program will reduce the demands on special education, thus both meeting student needs and easing administrative costs.
The Committee discussed numerous classroom interventions, including acceleration for gifted learners (Appendix B), and the references have an array of resources for schools.
The Committee addressed some key areas related to regular K-12 classrooms and advanced instruction: the lack of state reporting of achievement data on gifted students, the limited planning for gifted students in school improvement plans, the meaning and application of "least restrictive environment", college and dual enrollment, and distance learning as an accelerated learning option.
Data on Intellectually Gifted Student Achievement and Progress.
Data is currently collected on both academic achievement and progress of all students, but it is not currently disaggregated for the sub-population of students identified as intellectually gifted.
Such information would help in evaluating the effectiveness of programming and allow for improved planning in the future.
The Committee therefore recommends the State Board adopt a policy requesting the annual reporting of Tennessee Student Test Results, Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program, include disaggregated data on academic achievement and progress of intellectually gifted students enrolled in special education.
Again, this data already exists; the recommendation is simply to put it in usable and readily available form.
7.
.
Recommendation 4.1: The State Board of Education request the State Department of Education include the disaggregated data on academic achievement and progress for students identified as intellectually gifted by state eligibility criteria in the annual publication, Tennessee Student Test Results, Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program beginning in 2004.
School Improvement Plans.
Every Tennessee school should annually review its gifted education programs while it is reviewing school wide programs for all students.
The creation of exemplary school programs for intellectually gifted students may be facilitated by utilizing an evaluation rubric.
One such rubric is entitled "The National Association for Gifted Children Pre-K-12 Gifted Education Programming Standards," which addresses standards in the following areas: curriculum and instruction, program administration and management, program design, program evaluation, socio-emotional guidance and counseling, professional development, and student identification.
Other evaluation rubrics have been developed by The Association for the Gifted, a division of the Council for Exceptional Children.
The Committee did not endorse any standards to be included in school improvement plans but recommended a rule revision.
The new rule emphasizes that school improvement plans must address the educational needs of intellectually gifted students.
Recommendation 4.2: Amend Rule "0520-1-9-.02 RELATIONSHIP TO GENERAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS" by replacing the existing paragraph (3) to read: (3) School improvement plans must include a continuum of educational strategies and programs to address the educational needs of all students, including the needs of all students eligible for special education, including intellectually gifted students.
Least Restrictive Environment.
The Board of Education rule defining "least restrictive environment" (0520-1-9-.01(35)) and its application to intellectually gifted students has created confusion regarding student placement, access to advanced instruction, and program design.
The least restrictive environment for children with disabilities who have learning or physical limitations is usually the heterogeneous, same-age, general education classroom.
This environment provides most disabled children with a larger range of social interactions and a more challenging curriculum than would be available in a special class or school.
However, the regular same age classroom does not always provide gifted students with a similar opportunity for growth.
It often does not offer access to an appropriately challenging curriculum or opportunities to interact with students of similar ability levels.
There was no specific recommendation on how to resolve some of the issues related to least restrictive environment.
However, the committee suggested a variety of recommendations to strengthen academic services to intellectually gifted students.
College and Dual Enrollment.
College and dual enrollment programs, sometimes called "concurrent enrollment" programs, are ways to offer older K-12 students access to coursework not available in their middle or high schools.
Dual enrollment in Tennessee is regulated in both State law and Board rules.
State law (TCA 49-6-3111) allows intellectually gifted students to dual enroll as early as ninth grade if the student has a 3.2 grade point average and the enrollment is specified in an IEP and approved by the college.
Board rule 0520-1-3-.06 (4) defines three options for college enrollment.
The first option allows a high school senior with a 3.5 grade point 8.
. average and a score of 25 on the ACT to enroll in college full time and apply college credits toward the high school graduation requirement.
The second option allows a qualified junior or senior to enroll in college courses after school hours.
The third option allows all school districts to conduct college classes on their high school campuses.
Student eligibility for college and dual enrollment programs varies widely among states, but the trend is to open college access to a wider range of students, with the hope that less-motivated and underachieving high school students will benefit from the challenge of college courses.
Dual enrollment can acclimate students, including those in the middle of the achievement distribution, to a college environment while they are still in high school, and it can give students and schools an early indication about their level of preparedness.
In the face of budgetary pressures, schools must often limit the courses that they offer, particularly in science and technical areas that require expensive lab equipment, and upper level courses, which usually have small enrollments.
Smaller and rural school districts, in particular, are often limited in their abilities to offer such advanced instruction, and dual enrollment offers a ready means to offer this instruction to those students who need and would benefit from such challenge.
The Committee strongly recommends that the State Board of Education expand the dual enrollment options so that more students may take college classes before graduation.
School districts should be encouraged to partner with colleges to make dual enrollment easier and open to more students.
Moreover, early college experiences should not be limited to intellectually gifted students with IEPs and exceptionally high achieving students.
Recommendation 4.3: Amend State Board of Education Rules and Regulations to allow any high school junior or senior to dual enroll during school hours with the permission of the school and college by deleting the current language in State Board of Education Rule 0520-1-3-.06 (4) (b) and substituting the following language to read: (b) Option #2.
1.
A qualified student enrolled in the 11th and 12th grades may enroll in college level courses which are conducted at times other than the regular school day and during the school day at an institution of higher education.
The student may receive dual credit (high school and college) in such courses in accordance with the policy of the local school board of education.
State funds to the local school system shall not be diminished because of the student's participation.

A qualified student enrolled in 9th or 10th grade, who has a minimum ACT composite score of 21 (or the equivalent SAT score) may enroll in college level courses during or outside of school hours at an institution of higher education with the permission of the high school, parent/guardian, and college.
The student may receive high school credit in such courses in accordance with the policy of the local school board of education.
State funds to the local school system shall not be diminished because of the student's participation.
Distance learning.
Distance learning is defined as any educational situation in which teacher and student are not located in the same location--Internet based, correspondence, and television or video conferencing courses.
Advancements in media technology and increased access to the Internet have led to a rapid increase in the availability of online courses from many other sources Many intellectually gifted students would benefit from distance learning courses because their school offerings are limited.
Distance learning options are especially important in smaller and poorer school districts, which may lack the staff and resources to provide a wide range of advanced courses in the traditional classroom format.
One advantage of most distance learning courses is that they are self-paced.
They can allow a gifted grade-school student to complete a high school course at their pace and a gifted middle or high school student to complete the course at an accelerated rate, perhaps in several months.
Not all distance-learning programs are suitable for gifted students, and some are of higher quality than others.
The best courses are offered by accredited institutions, have aligned their curricula with state standards, provide a mentor or teacher that can assist the student, and allow the student to learn at his or her own pace.
The Committee recommends that the Board request the Department of Education publish and update annually a list of distance learning options and to indicate which courses closely follow state curriculum standards.
Recommendation 4.5: The State Board of Education request the Department of Education publish and update annually an online list of possible, not exclusive distance learning options that local school districts may use to supplement the educational needs of diverse students, including disabled students, intellectually gifted students, and English language learners.
This list shall indicate which courses closely follow state curriculum standards and would be good candidates for high school credit.
The State Department of Education will have the list online by February 1, 2005.

Providing pre-service, in-service, and advanced teacher training regarding the needs of intellectually gifted students.
Gifted learners are entitled to be served by professionals who have specialized preparation in gifted education, expertise in appropriate differentiated content 10.
. and instructional methods, involvement in ongoing professional development, and who possess exemplary personal and professional traits.
- Pre-K Grade 12 Gifted Program Standards, (National Association for Gifted Children, 1998) Throughout Committee deliberations, the need for well and highly trained staff arose again and again.
If effective changes are to be made relative to eligibility, testing and evaluation, and advanced instruction in regular classrooms, as outlined above, trained personnel are absolutely essential.
Two general areas of needed training were addressed: pre-service and advanced training for teachers, and pre-service training for psychologists and counselors.
Pre-Service and Advanced Training for Teachers.
Currently, the State Board of Education requires that all teachers of intellectually gifted students with IEPs meet an employment standard.
Teachers can meet this standard in one of three ways: (1) through college coursework or an approved in-service training program, (2) by consulting with a special education teacher who has met the training provision, or (3) by consulting with a special education teacher who received his or her license prior to September 1, 1989 and has not met the training provision.
(Tennessee Adminstrative Rules, State Board of Education, 0520-1-2-.03 (7)).
In October of 2003, the State Board of Education adopted new pre-service rules for teacher licensure (Tennessee Teacher Licensure Standards: Professional Education, October 31, 2003, see Appendix C).
These new rules ensure that all new teachers will be exposed to best teaching practices related to various student sub-populations, including intellectually gifted students.
The Committee believes that these revised licensure standards are a major advancement, and at this time suggests no additional pre-service requirements in gifted education for general and special education teachers-in-training.
There was a consensus that additional advanced training requirements are needed.
The employment standard for teachers does not require or encourage in-depth training, and as a result, few Tennessee school districts have subject matter experts in gifted education.
A core of highly trained staff in our schools would greatly strengthen the capacity of schools to meet the needs of all gifted students.
Teachers who earn a gifted education endorsement are better able to provide differentiated content and strategies that match identified student needs.
They can more reliably identify highability students in their classrooms through assessments and behavioral observations.
They understand the unique challenges of identifying and educating gifted students in poverty and from diverse cultural backgrounds.
They are better able to understand the overt, hidden, and masked behaviors of gifted students and to respond to their affective needs.
They are better able to collaborate with families and others in the assessment and educational planning for gifted students.
They understand and have empathy for their students' widely divergent interests, and seek ways to help gifted children express their areas of passion and excellence.
They can act as role models for other teachers and coach their colleagues in the use of instructional methods and accommodations.
These individuals could serve more successfully in gifted program management roles.
11.
.
Therefore, the Committee strongly recommends that the Board of Education create an endorsement in gifted education, and that the employment standard be amended to include the endorsement.
Tennessee is currently the only state in the Southeast that does not offer such an endorsement, and only such an endorsement will allow interested teachers to gain the type of detailed and in-depth training that is needed.
Recommendation 5.1: Request the State Board of Education to appoint a committee to draft Tennessee standards for Gifted Endorsement in PreK-12 to report to the Advisory Council on Teacher Education and various constituency groups for their input prior to reporting to the State Board of Education.
The Council for Exceptional Children and the National Association for the Gifted have developed a prototype gifted endorsement standard (Appendix D).
The State Board of Education would amend its rule to indicate the effective date and conditions for earning the endorsement.
The Committee believes that the current employment standards need to be modified to strengthen the teaching force serving intellectually gifted students.
There was agreement on many aspects of a new employment standard.
However, the employment standard requires more deliberation and input from persons outside of the Committee.
The following is one of the many draft employment standards suggested and discussed by the Committee.
Following this draft is the specific recommendation on the employment standard.
Draft of rule: Amend Rule 0520-1-2-.03 (7) "Employment Standards" to specify who should hold the endorsement: (7) Teaching Personnel in Gifted Education.
(a) A teacher who provides specialized, direct instruction to intellectually gifted with IEPs as part of their special education caseload and a teacher who serves as gifted education coordinator or gifted education consultant in regular or special education shall meet the following employment standards in 1.
and 2.: 1.
2.
A teacher must be endorsed in the appropriate content area and at the appropriate grade level or must hold a special education endorsement.
A teacher shall meet one of the following employment standards: (i) The teacher shall have completed six semester hours of college or university coursework or the equivalent in contact hours on the nature and needs and methods of teaching gifted students; The teacher shall hold a gifted education endorsement; The teacher shall have served such students prior to July 1, 1988, shall hold the special education endorsement prior to September 1, 1989, and shall have completed an in-service training program ii) iii) 12.
. approved by the Department of Education on the nature and needs and methods of teaching gifted students.
(b) A classroom teacher who is endorsed in the appropriate content area and at the appropriate grade level may work in concert with a consulting teacher who meets the employment standard in 7) a or shall meet the employment standard specified in 7) a.
Recommendation 5.2: Amend Rule 0520-1-2-.03 (7) "Employment Standards" to incorporate the gifted education endorsement called for in recommendation 5.1, and ensure that gifted education coordinators, gifted education consultants, and both special and general education teachers have meaningful and appropriate training or assistance to meet the needs of intellectually gifted students.
Pre-Service Training for Psychologists and Counselors.
Non-teaching school personnel who work with gifted students -- school psychologists and school counselors -- need to have a general awareness and exposure to relevant gifted education issues through pre-service training.
Therefore, the Committee strongly recommends that the Board add a pre-service requirement for psychologists-intraining and counselors-in-training.
School psychologists who receive training in identifying intellectually gifted students are better able to select, administer, and interpret the appropriate high-ceiling testing instruments.
They are more knowledgeable about the array of currently available high-ceiling and out-of-level screening and assessment instruments for culturally diverse students, gifted/learning disabled students, highly gifted students, and English language learners.
They can help develop researchbased school and district screening programs.
They can better understand the social and emotional aspects of gifted students.
School counselors who receive specialized training in counseling intellectually gifted students understand the positive and negative impact that asynchronous intellectual development can have on an individual's life and his or her family.
They better understand social-emotional issues that commonly affect intellectually gifted students including underachievement, perfectionism, difficulty in peer relationships, and inappropriate expectations.
They can assist in screening for gifted students and can provide early career and college counseling for accelerated students.
Therefore, to address the need for reaching a "broader" audience with pre-service training, the Committee recommends the establishment of appropriate licensure standards in gifted education for school psychologists and school counselors.
Recommendation 5.3: State Board of Education appoint a committee standards for school psychologists to include appropriate training in the and evaluation of intellectually gifted students.
The committee would Council on Teacher Education and various constituency groups for their to the State Board of Education.
to review pre-service characteristics, testing, report to the Advisory input prior to reporting 13.

CONCLUSION The State of Tennessee adopted legislation to provide appropriate services to intellectually gifted students in 1972, one of the first states to do so.
Tennessee can be proud of this and the fact that tens of thousands of Tennessee children have received a better and stronger and more meaningful education because of this commitment.
This Joint Study Committee was established and worked to find common ground among teachers, administrators, and parents on ways to strengthen, improve, and streamline the administration of gifted education services throughout the State.
The Committee is pleased to present this report and its recommendations--shared and practical proposals to better meet the academic, social, and emotional needs of our intellectually gifted students.
