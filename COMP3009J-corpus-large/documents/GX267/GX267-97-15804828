Sales Tax on Food and Alcohol at the Metrodome 2001 Season ($1,000s) Twins Vikings Gophers Other Total Comments Vikings and Gophers numbers have been consistent for last few years, but the Twins numbers were only about half as large in 2000, owing to lower attendance.

6.5% Gross Receipts Tax on Clothing and Other Sports Memorabilia Licensed by Professional and College Sports Estimate for 2003 ($1,000s) Taxable Items Clothing Other Items Clothing and other items MLB $1,500 $1,000 $2,500 NFL $2,700 $1,900 $4,600 NBA 
Estimate is for a 6.5% gross receipts tax (at retail) or a tax equal to 13% of wholesale.
Tax rate could be set at any rate desired.
Statewide tax base.
Source: Preliminary revenue estimate by Tax Research Division, Department of Revenue, based on national data from the Sporting Goods Manufacturing Association (www.sgma.com).
Notes: 1.
Table only includes revenue from taxing memorabilia for the four listed professional leagues.
If other sports or leagues (such as NASCAR or WWF) were included, revenue would be higher.
2.
The estimate for "collegiate sports memorabilia" is very preliminary because the breadth of that tax base has not been clearly defined.

Existing Income Tax Paid by Players from Visiting Teams Estimate for 2001 ($1,000s) MLB NFL Total Between $1,100 and $1,300 Between $ 250 and $ 350 Between $1,350 and $1,650 Future revenue would depend on salary levels in professional sports.

Table 5.
Lottery Games with a Sports Theme Estimate for 2001 ($1,000s) Gross income per game Net income per game (after dedication to other funds) $1,500 $ 612 The per-game revenue would be multiplied by the number of games dedicated to stadium finance each year.
It may be possible to capture all $1.5 million per game for stadium finance.
Source: Minnesota State Lottery.
Notes: 1.
Gross income is after deducting prizes, retailer commissions, and operating expenses.
Net income is after deducting dedicated revenue: $480,000 of in-lieu sales tax (dedicated to the Natural Resources Fund and Game and Fish Fund) and another $408,000 dedicated to the Environment and Natural Resources Fund.
2.
The State Lottery assumes that these games will replace other games with no increase in total lottery revenue, resulting in net revenue loss to the funds listed above.
Table 6.
Tax on Rental Vehicles in the Metro Area (Rentals of less than 30 days) Estimate for 2003 ($1,000s) Comments: A percentage tax would need to be a gross receipts tax rather than a sales tax, under the Streamlined Sales Tax agreement.
Source: Preliminary revenue estimate by Tax Research Division, Department of Revenue.
2% rental tax (metro area only) $3,400 Table 7.
Sales Tax Exemption for Stadium Construction Materials Hypothetical Cost of Stadium Value of Sales Tax Exemption ($1,000s) Comments Construction materials are assumed equal to 52 percent of actual construction costs, so exemption from state sales tax would cut costs by (6.5%)x(52%)x(construction costs).
This is a one-time cost (see note 3).
$300 million $500 million $10,100 $16,900 If host city has a local sales tax, the state exemption would mean exemption from local tax as well.
Source: Preliminary revenue estimate by Tax Research Division, Department of Revenue.
Notes: 1.
The actual stadium cost is unknown, so two hypothetical costs are shown.
2.
"Construction costs" here exclude the cost of land, architectural fees and other soft costs.
3.
Typically, construction materials exemptions are administered as refunds payable during construction so the state revenue impact occurs over several fiscal years.
If desired for budget reasons, legislation could provide for a lump-sum refund of sales tax to be paid in one fiscal year when construction is complete.
OTHER REVENUES Media Access Charge A rent based on gross receipts is similar to the rent that most shopping malls charge their tenants.
The amount of rent could be set at the percentage necessary to raise a set amount of revenue and/or it could be set consistent with rent charged to vendors and other parties that use the stadium to further their business activities.

Fees for use of the broadcast facilities at a stadium, at rates of $10,000 per game for television/cable and $5,000 per game for radio broadcast, would raise an estimated $2.16 million per year from Major League Baseball and $215,000 per year from National Football League broadcasts assuming that these fees are in addition to any existing fees.
(If they replace existing fees, then the new revenue yield would be less).

Naming Rights
As this report says, naming rights are a matter for negotiation.
Recently in the United States, naming rights for new professional sports stadiums typically have yielded $2 million to $2.5 million per year for terms of ten to thirty years.
The range is between $900,000 and $4 million per year.
Personal Seat Licensing Details are needed before an estimate can be prepared for revenues from personal seat licenses.
Personal seat license provisions in 1997 legislation (to finance a major league baseball stadium) were estimated to raise $500,000 in one-time revenue.
Gaming Revenues Estimates for sports lottery games are shown on the tables.
The revenue potential from new types of legal gaming cannot be estimated without more specific information.
