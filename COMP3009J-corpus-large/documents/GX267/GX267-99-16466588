D IMENSION STONE By Jim F. Lemons, Jr.
Georgia, New Hampshire, and Vermont.
Rock of Ages is now the largest supplier of granite memorials in North America following its merger with two Vermont granite producers, Anderson-Friberg Co.
(AFCO) and Lawson Granite Co.
Rock of Ages has operations in Canada, Georgia, New Hampshire, and Vermont.
More than one-half of its sales are for the granite memorial market (Stone World, 1996c).
Indiana Limestone Co. continues as one of the principal suppliers to the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC, planned for completion in late 1997.
This building will encompass 7,000 cubic meters of limestone, about 4 2,000 fabricated pieces.
Indiana Limestone was also used on the nearby U.S. Commerce Building (Dimensional Stone, 1996b).
Colorado Yule Marble has been chosen for The Women in Military Service Memorial in Washington, DC.
This marble was selected to match the exterior marble used in the nearby Lincoln Memorial.
The new memorial will be composed of more than 835 square meters of marble in panel thicknesses ranging from 38 to 76 millimeters (Stone World, 1996a).
Granite.--Dimension granite includes all coarse-grained igneous rocks.
Production in 1996 remained comparable with 1995 levels at 501,000 tons with a value of $108 million.
Granite was produced by 39 companies at 74 quarries in 20 States.
Cold Spring Granite, Fletcher Granite, and Rock of Ages were the leading producers (listed alphabetically) and accounted for 56% of U.S. production.
Georgia continued to be the leading State, producing 18% of the U.S. total.
(See table 4.)
Limestone.--Dimension limestone includes bituminous, dolomitic, and siliceous limestones.
Production in 1996 decreased 4% compared with 1995 levels, to 350,000 tons, with a 6% decrease in value, to $57.3 million.
It was produced by 29 companies at 39 quarries in 10 States.
Indiana, the leading State, produced 156,000 tons in 1996, with Wiconsin as the second largest producer and Kansas as the third largest.
(See table 5.)
Sandstone.--Dimension sandstone includes calcareous- and siliceous-cemented sandstones or conglomerates.
Quartzite, which also is included, may be described as any siliceouscemented sandstone.
In 1996, the U.S. total for sandstone increased by 4% from 1995 levels to 151,000 tons valued at $20.1 million.
Dimension sandstone was produced by 26 companies at 47 quarries in 15 States.
Leading producing States were New York and Pennsylvania.
(See table 6.)
Consumption Production during the year was assumed to equal consumption, because no separate accounting is made of changes in industry stocks.
Rough stone represented 50% by tonnage and 36% by value of the dimension stone market.
The Dimension stone consists of rough stone and quarried blocks of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rock, including granite, marble, limestone, sandstone, and slate.
These stones, because of strength, toughness, hardness, and resistance to environmental damage find application as panels, slabs, and other shapes in building and construction, in monuments, and in curbing.
U.S. stone production data are developed by the U.S. Geological Survey from a voluntary survey of U.S. producers of rough and finished dimension stone.
Of the 228 producing dimension stone operations included in the survey for 1996, 174 or 76% responded.
These represent 79% of the estimated tonnage for the industry shown in table 1.
(See table 1.)
In addition, 13 former producers were reported to be idle in 1996.
In 1996, stone production remained comparable with that of 1995 at 1.15 million metric tons valued at $234 million.
Exports of dimension stone decreased slightly in value to $49.5 million.
Dimension stone imports for consumption are almost double domestic production at $462 million.
Legislation and Government Programs U.S. Customs has approved a separate classification of imported monuments and markers from other stone products.
This new classification, sought by a coalition of U.S. dimension stone producers, will assist domestic companies in evaluating foreign competition in this product category.
Current import duty information is shown for dimension stone products in table 2.
(See table 2.)
Production Stone blocks cut or split from a quarry face typically are transported to processing plants, commonly located at the site, for final sizing and finishing operations.
Stone finishing may include polishing, edging, and decorating.
Recent developments in quarry and processing technology include techniques for utilizing water-jet technology and computer-aided design to pr oduce curved cuts, inlays, medallions, and borders (Dimensional Stone, 1996a).
Of the total dimension stone production in 1996, 44% was granite, 30% was limestone, 13% was sandstone, 2% was marble, 2% was slate, and 9% was miscellaneous stone.
Georgia, Indiana, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin were the largest dimension-stone-producing States representing 50% of total domestic production.
(See table 3.)
Leading producing companies (listed alphabetically) were Cold Spring Granite Co., principally in California, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Texas; Eden Stone Co. in Wisconsin; Fletcher Granite Co., Inc. in Massachusetts and New Hampshire; Halquist Stone Co., Inc. in Wisconsin; Indiana Limestone Co., Inc. in Indiana; and Rock of Ages Corp. in U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY--MINERALS INFORMATION--1996 1 largest uses of rough stone were in building and construction (51%) and monumental (25%).
Dressed stone represented 50% by tonnage and 64% by value of the total stone consumed.
The largest uses of dressed stone were in ashlars and partially squared pieces at 25%, flagging at 21%, curbing at 19%, and monumental at 8%.
(See table 7.)
Granite.--Primary uses of the 1996 reported consumption of granite by weight (501,000 tons) were in monumental applications (rough stone 28% and dressed stone 8%), rough blocks for construction 26%, and dressed stone used in curbing 20%.
(See table 8) According to a 1996 National Kitchen and Bath Association survey, granite is used 23% of the time for kitchen countertops and 9% of the time in bathroom applications (Stone World, 1996b).
Limestone.--Primary uses of the 1995 reported consumption of limestone by weight (350,000 tons) were in rough blocks for building and construction 41%, and dressed stone for ashlars and partially squared pieces, 18%.
(See table 9.)
Marble.--Dimension marble includes certain hard limestones, travertines, and any other calcareous stone that can be polished.
Marble sold or used in the United States in 1996 is reported to be 27,900 tons valued at $19.9 million.
Marble was p roduced by 7 companies at 13 quarries in 6 States and Puerto Rico.
(See table 10.)
Sa ndstone.--Primary uses of the 1996 reported consumption of sandstone by weight (151,000 tons) were in dressed stone for flagging (52%), and dressed stone for ashlars and partially squared pieces (18%).
(See table 11.)
Slate.--Slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock derived from shale, siltstone, or claystone.
Shale is composed mostly of original clay minerals, and cleavage is parallel to the bedding.
Dimension slate sold or used by producers in the United States in 1996 was reported to be 24,700 tons valued at $16.5 million.
Slate was produced by 15 companies at 20 quarries in 8 States.
Forty-three percent of the slate was used for roofing.
(See table 12.)
Prices The average 1996 price for dimension stone remained comparable with 1995 values at $203 per ton.
Color and grain structure contribute significantly to price and marketability.
Foreign Trade Exports.--Exports of dimension stone decreased slightly in value to $49.5 million.
The primary export was granite, principally to Italy.
There has been some decline in sales to Japan and the Republic of Korea due to increased competition from Chinese producers.
(See table 13.)
Imports.--Imports for consumption of dimension stone decreased slightly from 1995 values to $462 million, as noted in table 1.
A more detailed breakdown by type of stone is shown in tables 13, 14, 15, and 16.
Italy remains a principal supplier of granite.
Other principal suppliers of granite are Brazil, Canada, and India.
Current Research and Technology The development of techniques to use thin sandwich panels of stone attached to various backings with the use of adhesives has opened applications of stone usage in luxury cruise liners as walls and floors and in residential markets as dividing panels, countertops, and doors.
(Napoli and Ragore, 1996).
The use of high-precision water-jet technology makes it possible to create very complicated designs with near zero tolerance levels on an industrial scale.
This technology can cut angles of a fraction of a degree, work with inclinations of up to 45E, cut groves less than 1.5 millimeters and cut round shapes and curves (Dimensional Stone, 1996a).
Outlook Demand is expected to grow for dimension stone during the next 5 to 10 years because of applications in residential markets, improved technology and variety, and the increased costs of alternate construction materials.
In office building construction, growth is expected in the renovation markets.
Current high commercial vacancy rates has increased competition in attracting and keeping tenants, causing some owners to upgrade appearance with stone (Reis, 1996).
