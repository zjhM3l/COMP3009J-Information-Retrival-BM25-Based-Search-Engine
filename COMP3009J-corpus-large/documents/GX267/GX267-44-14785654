Sporting Dogs The sporting dogs are placed into four basic categories: pointers, retrievers,
setters, and spaniels.
This group contains what we usually consider the hunting dogs.
Pointers and setters are the breeds that "point" when hunting birds.
Spaniels are generally smaller and are used to flush birds from cover.
Retrievers recover downed birds after they have been shot.
In general, these breeds are of good temperament and most make good family or companion animals.
These dogs are very active and require exercise to stay in shape.
Some of the more popular breeds in the sporting group are: ! ! ! ! ! American Cocker Spaniel Golden Retriever Irish Setter Labrador Retriever Pointer

Wildlife Identification As an animal control officer, you may need to solve problems with wildlife.
You may have to remove wildlife from residential areas, capture potentially rabid wildlife, or just identify a wild animal.
You must be able to recognize and identify the high- and low-risk animals for transmitting rabies as stated in Chapter 826 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.
It is important to know the difference between high- and low-risk animals when dealing with wildlife bites to humans.
