The 1990 CAAA are subdivided into the following seven major titles that address specific air quality and pollution issues.
Title I: Title Title Title Title Title Title Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) II: Provisions Relating to Mobile Sources III: Air Toxics IV: Acid Deposition Control V: Permits VI: Stratospheric Ozone and Global Climate Protection VII: Provisions Relating to Enforcement Requirements in Titles I, III, IV, and V have, or may have in the future, an impact on both new and existing combustion boilers.4 Title I contains requirements for effectively achieving national air quality goals.
Under Sect. 109, EPA is authorized to establish primary and secondary NAAQS.
These standards represent the maximum allowable concentration of a pollutant permitted in the ambient air.
Primary ambient air quality standards define levels of air quality that are considered necessary, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health.
Secondary ambient air quality standards are intended to protect the public welfare from any known or adverse effects of a pollutant.
Both standards are subject to revision, and additional primary and secondary standards may be promulgated, as the EPA Administrator deems necessary to protect the public health and welfare.
Under Sect. 110 of Title I, states are required to adopt plans for implementing, maintaining, and enforcing NAAQS in each air quality control region within its jurisdiction.
Such plans are known as State Implementation Plans (SIPs).
These plans establish emission standards for specific sources.
To achieve compliance, states are subdivided into a number of identifiable areas known as air quality control regions in which at least the minimum NAAQS must be met or control requirements imposed.
If the level 4-1 of a regulated pollutant exceeds the specified federal standard within a particular region, it is classified as a nonattainment area (NAA).
When a region fails to meet a NAAQS, more stringent emission control requirements, designed to reduce emission levels and thereby achieve attainment, must be applied.
As in prior environmental legislation, local or state environmental regulatory agencies may impose stricter regulations on individual sources or areas.
Authorization for EPA to establish performance standards for new stationary sources is provided in Sect. 111 of Title I. These New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) establish maximum emission rates for selected pollutants from new steam generating units and existing units that undergo substantial modifications.
This legislation ensures that standard emissions controls are applied uniformly in all areas, irrespective of ambient air quality considerations.
According to the legislation, the degree of emissions limitation is achieved through the application of the best system of emission reduction, which has been adequately demonstrated.
Title III amended Sect. 112 of the CAA regarding requirements for reducing emissions of toxic air pollutants.
Toxic air pollutants are those pollutants that are hazardous to human health or the environment but are not specifically covered under another portion of the CAA.
The CAA of 1990 includes a comprehensive plan for achieving significant reductions in emission of HAPs from major sources.
Section 112 includes a list of toxic air pollutants for which emissions must be reduced.
Often characterized as carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxins, these pollutants are typically subdivided into the following groups: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ metals, including cadmium, mercury, lead, and PM; organics, including dioxins and furans; and acid gases, including hydrogen chloride, SO2, and NOx.
To establish regulations for these pollutants, EPA developed and published a list of source categories that emit 10 tons/year of any one or 25 tons/year of any combination of those pollutants.
Based on this list, EPA has either issued or is now developing Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for each listed source category.
These standards are based on the best demonstrated control technology or practice within the regulated industry.
Currently, EPA has established MACT standards for certain HAP sources, including large municipal waste combustion units.
Standards for ICI boilers that burn fossil fuels are under development.
From a boiler emissions viewpoint, mercury and hydrogen chloride are the two HAPs that will likely be regulated.
When developing a MACT standard for a particular source category, EPA looks at the level of emissions currently being achieved by the best-performing similar sources through clean processes, control devices, work practices, or other methods.
These emissions levels set a baseline (often referred to as the "MACT floor") for the new standard.
At a minimum, a MACT standard must achieve, throughout the industry, a level of emissions control that is at least equivalent to the MACT floor.
The MACT floor is established differently for existing sources and new sources.
For existing sources, the MACT floor must equal the average emissions limitations currently achieved by the best-performing 12% of sources in that source category, provided there are 30 or more existing sources within the category.
If there are fewer than 30 existing sources, then the MACT floor must equal the average emissions limitation achieved by the best-performing five sources in the category.
For new sources, the MACT floor must equal the level of emissions control currently achieved by the best-controlled similar source.
Wherever feasible, EPA writes the final MACT standard as an emissions limit (i.e., as a percent reduction in emissions or a concentration limit that regulated sources must achieve).
Emissions limits provide flexibility for industry to determine the most effective way to comply with the standard.
Title IV establishes requirements for significantly reducing NOx and SO2 emissions.
To achieve this statutory goal, EPA established the Acid Rain Program.
Its objective is to reduce adverse effects of acid deposition by controlling SO2 and NOx emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants.
Requirements for SO2 emissions are contained in Sect. 403.
This section addresses the SO2 allowance program for new and 4-2 existing units.
Separate requirements for NOx emissions are provided in Sect. 407.
These requirements are part of the EPA's NOx emission reduction program.

xiii xiv EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Boiler owners and operators who need additional generating capacity face a number of legal, political, environmental, economic, and technical challenges.
Their key to success requires selection of an adequately sized low-emission boiler and combustion equipment that can be operated in compliance with emission standards established by state and federal regulatory agencies.
Recognizing that many issues are involved in making informed selection decisions, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT) sponsored efforts at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to develop a guide for use in choosing low-emission boilers and combustion equipment.
To ensure that the guide covers a broad range of technical and regulatory issues of particular interest to the commercial boiler industry, the guide was developed in cooperation with the American Boiler Manufacturers Association (ABMA), the Council of Industrial Boiler Owners (CIBO), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The guide presents topics pertaining to industrial, commercial, and institutional (ICI) boilers.
Background information about various types of commercially available boilers is provided along with discussions
about the fuels that they burn and the emissions that they produce.
Also included are discussions about emissions standards and compliance issues, technical details related to emissions control techniques, and other important selection considerations.
Although information in the guide is primarily applicable to new ICI boilers, it may also apply to existing boiler installations.
Use of the guide is primarily intended for those involved in either expanding current steam or hot water generating capacity or developing new capacity.
Potential users include owners, operators, plant managers, and design engineers who are involved in selecting low-emission boilers and combustion equipment that comply with established emissions requirements.
Regulatory authorities who deal with emission issues and boiler permit applications may also find useful information in the guide.
The guide is organized into topics that address many of the fundamental concerns encountered in planning a new steam or hot water boiler system.
An overview of boilers, fuel feed systems, fuels, and emissions, which are fundamental considerations in the planning process, is presented in the first part of the guide.
Discussions about firetube, watertube, cast iron, and tubeless boilers that burn fossil or nonfossil fuels are presented in Chap. 2.
Technical terms and emission control techniques introduced in the overview provide a foundation for following discussions.
Issues pertaining to solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels commonly fired in ICI boilers are presented in the first part of Chap. 3.
Characteristics of fossil and nonfossil fuels are included with emphasis on coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, and refuse-derived fuels (RDFs).
For completeness, other materials such as heavy residuals from petroleum-cracking processes, coal tar pitch, and pulp mill sludge, which are sometimes used as boiler fuel, are briefly described.
Following the fuel discussions, emphasis shifts to solid and gaseous emissions that are regulated under the Clean Air Act (CAA).
The four principle emissions from combustion boilers that are regulated under this act include nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), and carbon monoxide (CO).
Mechanisms by which these emissions are formed are briefly described as an aid in understanding the various control techniques for reducing emissions.
The legal basis for regulating emissions from combustion boilers is contained in the CAA.
This piece of environmental legislation addresses concerns about ground-level ozone, the accumulation of fine particles in the atmosphere, and acid rain.
It also authorizes EPA to establish performance-based emissions standards for certain air pollutants including NOx, SO2, PM, and CO.
A summary of emission limitations that are applicable to combustion boilers is presented in Appendix A. These limitations are specified as (1) maximum emission rates or (2) required reductions in potential combustion concentrations.
Although the mandated emission limitations are a function of boiler type and size, the amount of each emission that may be released is strongly influenced by the type of fuel or fuel mixture being burned, the method of combustion, and the geographical location of the installation.
In addition to xv discussions about the CAA, other topics covered in Chap. 4 include information sources, permitting issues, and lessons learned.
Techniques that are effective in reducing NOx, SO2, and PM emissions are subdivided into three general categories, depending on which stage in the combustion process they are applied.
The categories include precombustion, combustion, and postcombustion emission control techniques.
Table ES.1 shows the various techniques that may be applied to reduce these emissions.
Descriptions of each technique are presented in Chap. 5.
As an aid in boiler and combustion equipment selection, emission control options for 14 of the most popular boiler and fuel combinations are identified and discussed in Chap. 6.
These options reflect combustion of coal, fuel oil, natural gas, biomass, and RDF in watertube and firetube boilers.
Figure ES.1 presents the general format used to identify the various emission control options that are available for a particular boiler and fuel combination.
Use of information presented in the tables will help ensure that the best available control technologies are identified.
Although many factors must be considered when selecting a low-emission boiler and combustion equipment, the final choice should not be made until the performance of the complete system is evaluated and understood.

However, results of these evaluations are now an essential element of the permitting process.
Details of the evaluations often establish the technical basis for permit applications submitted to regulatory authorities as part of the permitting process.
Unless these evaluations are accurate and complete and unless currently accepted techniques for controlling emissions are adequately taken into consideration, it is unlikely that the regulatory authority will act favorably on the application.
Information presented in this guide is intended to help owners and operators prepare permit applications that address the principal concerns and legal requirements of the regulatory authority.

INTRODUCTION Boiler owners and operators who need additional generating capacity face a number of legal, political, environmental, economic, and technical challenges.
Their key to success requires selection of an adequately sized low-emission boiler and combustion equipment that can be operated in compliance with emission standards established by state and federal regulatory agencies.
This guide presents a broad overview of technical and regulatory issues that may be encountered at various points in the selection process.
Information in the guide is primarily applicable to new industrial, commercial, and institutional (ICI) boilers and combustion equipment that must comply with emission requirements in the Clean Air Act (CAA).1 These boilers are designed to use the chemical energy in fuel to raise the energy content of water so that it can be used for heating and power applications.
Industrial boilers are used extensively in the chemical, food processing, paper, and petroleum industries.
Commercial and institutional boilers are used in many other applications, including commercial businesses, office buildings, apartments, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, schools, museums, government buildings, and airports.
Use of the guide is primarily intended for those involved in either expanding current steam or hot water generating capacity or developing new capacity.
Potential users include owners, operators, plant managers, and design engineers who are involved in the selection process.
Regulatory authorities that deal with emission issues and boiler permit applications may also find the guide useful.
The guide was prepared at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT).
To ensure that the guide covers a broad range of technical and regulatory issues of particular interest to the commercial boiler industry, the guide was developed in cooperation with the American Boiler Manufacturers Association (ABMA), the Council of Industrial Boiler Owners (CIBO), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
1.1 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES Information is presented for a broad class of steam and hot-water generating units known as ICI boilers.
General discussions about commercially available ICI boilers are provided as well as information about the fuels that they burn and the emissions that they release.
Discussions on environmental regulations, including emissions standards and compliance issues, technical details related to emission control techniques, and important considerations for combustion equipment selection, are also presented
.
Emissions from ICI boilers that are currently regulated under the CAA are addressed in detail.
These emissions, which include nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM),
are released whenever certain fossil and nonfossil fuels are burned.
For discussion purposes, techniques for reducing these emissions from ICI boilers are subdivided into three categories: precombustion, combustion, and postcombustion emission control techniques.
Although emission requirements for toxic air pollutants, which are also regulated under the CAA, have only been established for large municipal waste combustion units, a brief discussion about these pollutants is provided because emissions from combustion boilers may soon be regulated.
Other important topics such as selection of process control instrumentation and emissions monitoring systems, which are key functional elements in new low-emission boiler installations, are not specifically addressed in this guide.
The primary objectives of the guide are to (1) present a broad range of issues that should be considered during the selection of new low-emission ICI boilers and combustion equipment and (2) identify information sources that contain relevant technical details.
The guide is not intended to serve as a stepby-step design, procurement, or operations manual, nor is it considered a state-of-the-art report on combustion technology.
Although information in the guide is primarily applicable to new ICI boilers, it may also apply to existing boiler installations.
Issues pertaining to the selection of heat recovery steam generators or gas turbines are beyond the scope of the guide.
Additional discussions about important boiler topics are presented in documents prepared by ABMA, CIBO, and DOE.25 1-1 1.2 APPROACH Information is organized into topics that address many of the fundamental concerns encountered in planning a new steam or hot water boiler system that must comply with established emission standards.
An overview of boilers, fuels, and emissions, which are fundamental considerations in the planning process, is presented immediately after the introduction.
Terms and emission control concepts introduced in the overview provide a foundation for following discussions.
Chapter 2 focuses on the various types of ICI boilers that are commercially available.
Emphasis is placed on firetube and watertube boilers although some discussion about other types of boilers, including cast iron and tubeless boilers, is also provided.
Descriptions of solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels commonly fired in ICI boilers are presented in the first part of Chap. 3.
Characteristics of fossil and nonfossil fuels are included with emphasis on coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, and refuse-derived fuels (RDFs).
For completeness, other materials such as heavy residuals from petroleum-cracking processes, coal tar pitch, and pulp mill sludge, which are sometimes used as boiler fuel, are briefly described.
Following the fuel discussions, emphasis shifts to solid and gaseous emissions that are regulated under the CAA.1 Mechanisms by which these emissions are formed are briefly described as an aid in understanding the various emission control techniques that can be used to reduce emissions.
Finally, the topic of efficiency is discussed.
Efficiency is an important selection consideration because extracting as much energy from the fuel as possible is an effective way to reduce the total amount of emissions that are released.
The legal basis for regulating emissions from combustion boilers is contained in the CAA.1 Discussions in Chap. 4 focus on this complex piece of environmental legislation that addresses concerns about ground-level ozone, the accumulation of fine particles in the atmosphere, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and acid rain.
It also authorizes EPA to establish performance-based emissions standards for a broad list of pollutants.
Federal emission limitations that are currently applicable to combustion boilers are tabulated in Appendix A. These limitations are specified as (1) maximum emission rates or (2) required reductions in potential combustion concentrations.
Although the mandated emission limitations are a function of boiler type and size, the amount of each emission that may be released is strongly influenced by the type of fuel or fuel mixture being burned, the method of combustion, and the geographical location of the installation.
Techniques for reducing emissions before, during, and after combustion are presented in Chap. 5.
Emission reductions can sometimes be achieved by switching to a different fuel or treating the fuel prior to combustion.
As an example, SO2 emissions from coal combustion can often be reduced by using lowsulfur instead of high-sulfur coal or by removing materials such as pyrites from the coal before it is fed into the boiler.
Although these two precombustion emission control techniques are sometimes very effective, meaningful reductions generally require outfitting a boiler with special combustion equipment designed to implement a particular emissions control strategy.
Reductions can be achieved by using an emission control technique that keeps the emission from forming during combustion or removes it after combustion has occurred.
These approaches to emissions reduction are reflected in the guidelines for selecting low-emission boilers and combustion equipment presented in Chap. 6.
Discussions in this chapter focus on ICI boilers that burn various types of fuel and identify precombustion, combustion, and postcombustion emission control techniques that should be considered.
As an aid in boiler and combustion equipment selection, emission control options for 14 of the most popular boiler and fuel combinations are identified.
These options reflect combustion of coal, fuel oil, natural gas, biomass, and RDF in watertube and firetube boilers.
Use of this information will help ensure that the best available control technologies (BACTs) are identified.
References cited throughout the guide are listed for each chapter and also compiled in a bibliography.
Information from these references was used to develop the text and tables that appear in the guide.

INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL BOILERS Combustion boilers are designed to use the chemical energy in fuel to raise the energy content of water so that it can be used for heating and power applications.
Many fossil and nonfossil fuels are fired in boilers, but the most common types of fuel include coal, oil, and natural gas.
During the combustion process, oxygen reacts with carbon, hydrogen, and other elements in the fuel to produce a flame and hot combustion gases.
As these gases are drawn through the boiler, they cool as heat is transferred to water.
Eventually the gases flow through a stack and into the atmosphere.
As long as fuel and air are both available to continue the combustion process, heat will be generated.
Boilers are manufactured in many different sizes and configurations depending on the characteristics of the fuel, the specified heating output, and the required emissions controls.
Some boilers are only capable of producing hot water, while others are designed to produce steam.
Various studies have been conducted to estimate the number of boilers in the United States, but no data source provides a complete representation of the existing boiler population.1 In the United States, boilers are typically designed and constructed as either power or heating boilers in accordance with applicable requirements adopted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
Rules for power boilers are provided in Sect.
I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.2 These rules apply to steam boilers that operate above 15 psig and hot water boilers that operate above 160 psig or 250Ã¯Â¿Â½F.
Common design pressures are 150, 200, 250, and 300 psig, but higher pressures are possible.
3 For example, boilers for certain pulp and paper industry applications are now designed for pressures as high as 1,500 psig.
Corresponding rules for heating boilers are provided in Sect.
IV.4 According to these rules, heating boilers that produce hot water are not allowed to operate above 160 psig or at temperatures above 250Ã¯Â¿Â½F at or near the boiler outlet.
Additional rules limit heating boilers that produce steam to a maximum operating pressure of 15 psig.
Many boilers with heat input capacities more than 250 million British thermal units per hour (MBtu/h) are classified as utility boilers because they are used at power plants to produce electricity.
Some boilers of this size are also used at paper mills and institutions and for other industrial applications.
Smaller boilers with less capacity are categorized as ICI boilers.
Industrial boilers are used extensively by the chemical, food processing, paper, and petroleum industries.
They have heat input capacities up to and sometimes more than 250 MBtu/h.
Commercial and institutional boilers are used in many other applications including commercial businesses, office buildings, apartments, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, schools, museums, government buildings, and airports.
In the past when emissions were less regulated, choosing the right boiler and combustion equipment for a particular application generally involved matching the process requirements with the boiler's output capacity.
Proper sizing and selection required knowledge of the peak process requirements and an understanding of the load profile.
This boiler selection philosophy emphasized energy conversion at the lowest possible cost.
Reduced emphasis was placed on controlling emissions.
Public concerns about air and water quality and enactment of federal, state, and local regulations have shifted this emphasis.
The current design objective is to provide low-cost energy with an acceptable impact on the environment.
As discussed in an engineering manual published by ABMA, control of PM, NOx, CO, and SO2 emissions is now a significant consideration in the overall boiler and combustion equipment design and selection process.3 2.1 TYPES OF ICI BOILERS Information in this guide focuses primarily on a broad class of steam and hot water generating units known as ICI boilers.
Because of differences in their features and characteristics, ICI boilers can be classified in at least three ways.
2-1 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Boilers are commonly subdivided into watertube or firetube units.
These designations reflect the way the water and combustion gases are designed to pass through the unit.
Boilers are sometimes classified by their heat sources.
For example, boilers are often referred to as oil-fired, gas-fired, coal-fired, or solid fuel-fired boilers.
Coal-fired boilers can be further divided based on the equipment used to fire the boiler.
The three major coal-fired boiler subclasses are pulverized-coal (PC) fired, stoker-fired, and fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) boilers.
Boilers are occasionally distinguished by their method of fabrication.
Packaged boilers are assembled in a factory, mounted on a skid, and transported to the site as one package ready for hookup to auxiliary piping.
Shop-assembled boilers are built up from a number of individual pieces or subassemblies.
After these parts are aligned, connected, and tested, the entire unit is shipped to the site in one piece.
Field-erected boilers are too large to transport as an entire assembly.
They are constructed at the site from a series of individual components.
Sometimes these components require special transportation and lifting considerations because of their size and weight.
The basic purpose of any ICI boiler is to convert the chemical energy in fuel into thermal energy that can be used to generate steam or hot water.
Inside the combustion chamber, two fundamental processes must occur to achieve this objective.
First, the fuel must be mixed with sufficient oxygen to allow sustained combustion.
The heated gases produced by the combustion process must then transfer the thermal energy to a fluid such as water or steam.
Various components inside the boiler are required to promote efficient combustion and heat transfer.
Their design depends on factors such as the type of fuel and the method selected to transfer thermal energy.
The ICI boilers are manufactured in a wide range of sizes to burn coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, and RDFs as well as other fuels and fuel combinations.
Most ICI boilers are classified as either watertube or firetube boilers, but other designs such as cast iron, coil-type, and tubeless (steel shell) boilers are also produced.
Descriptions of some of the more typical boiler designs are presented below.
Additional details about ICI boilers and their design, construction, and operation are available from other sources.3,57 2.1.1 Firetube Boilers Firetube boilers consist of a series of straight tubes that are housed inside a water-filled outer shell.
The tubes are arranged so that hot combustion gases flow through the tubes.
As hot gases flow through the tubes, they heat the water that surrounds the tubes.
The water is confined by the outer shell of the boiler.
To avoid the need for a thick outer shell, firetube boilers are used for lower-pressure applications.
Generally, the heat input capacities for firetube boilers are limited to 50 MBtu/h or less,5 but in recent years the size of firetube boilers has increased.
Firetube boilers are subdivided into three groups.
Horizontal return tubular (HRT) boilers typically have horizontal, self-contained firetubes with a separate combustion chamber.
Scotch, Scotch marine, or shell boilers have the firetubes and combustion chamber housed within the same shell.
Firebox boilers have a water-jacketed firebox and employ, at most, three passes of combustion gases.
Boiler configurations for each type are shown in Figs. 2.12.3, respectively.
Most modern firetube boilers have cylindrical outer shells with a small round combustion chamber located inside the bottom of the shell.
Depending on construction details, these boilers have tubes configured in either one, two, three, or four pass arrangements.
Because the design of firetube boilers is simple, they are easy to construct in a shop and can be shipped fully assembled as a package unit.
Table 2.1 identifies various types of firetube boilers and the associated fuels that they typically burn.

In older designs, the tubes are either straight or bent into simple shapes.
Newer boilers have tubes with complex and diverse bends.
Because the pressure is confined inside the tubes, watertube boilers can be fabricated in larger sizes and used for higher-pressure applications.
Small watertube boilers, which have one and sometimes two burners, are generally fabricated and supplied as packaged units.
Because of their size and weight, large watertube boilers are often fabricated in pieces and assembled in the field.
Configurations for packaged and field-erected watertube boilers are shown in Figs. 2.4 and 2.5, respectively.
Almost any solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel can be burned in a watertube boiler.
Common fuels include coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, and other solid fuels such as municipal solid waste (MSW), tire-derived fuel (TDF), and RDF.
Designs of watertube boilers that burn these fuels can be significantly different.
Various watertube boilers and the fuels that they commonly burn are identified in Table 2.2.
Configurations of boilers for burning RDF, MSW, and other solid fuel are shown in Figs. 2.62.8 (Ref. 9).
Coal-fired watertube boilers are classified into three major categories: stoker-fired units, PC-fired units, and FBC boilers.
Stoker-fired boilers include a mechanical system that is designed to feed solid fuel into the boiler.
These stokers are designed to support the combustion process and to remove the ash as it accumulates.
All stokers operate similarly.
They use both undergrate and overfire air to burn fuel located on a grate.
Different designs for stokers are described in Sect. 2.2.1.
The PC-fired boilers are generally large field-erected units such as the one shown in Fig. 2.9.
During operation, finely ground coal is mixed with primary combustion air and fed to the burner or burners where it ignites.
Secondary combustion air is then supplied to complete the combustion process.
Depending on the location of the burners and the direction of coal injection, PC-fired boilers can be classified as single- or opposed-wall, tangential (corner), or cyclone boilers.
Discussions about burners for PC-fired boilers are provided in Sect. 2.2.2.

molten state, PC-fired boilers are also classified as dry or wet bottom.
Opposed-wall boilers are usually much larger than 250-MBtu/h heat input capacity.
They are used primarily for utility but may be suitable for certain industrial applications.
Coal burned in cyclone boilers is crushed rather than pulverized.
The FBC boilers are capable of burning a wide range of solid fuels.
In this method of combustion, fuel is burned in a bed of hot incombustible particles suspended by an upward flow of fluidizing gas such as air.
Fuels that contain a high concentration of ash, sulfur, and nitrogen can be burned efficiently while meeting stringent emission limitations.
When sulfur capture is not required, inert materials such as alumina may be added to supplement the fuel ash and maintain the bed.
In applications where sulfur capture is required, limestone is incorporated into the bed and used as the sorbent.10 The FBC boilers are categorized as either atmospheric or pressurized units.
Atmospheric FBC boilers are further divided into bubbling-bed and circulating-bed units; the fundamental difference between these two is the fluidization velocity.
Coal is often burned in FBC boilers, but it is also possible to burn biomass and other solid fuels.
Natural gas or fuel oil is used primarily as a start-up fuel to preheat the fluidized bed or as an auxiliary fuel when additional heat is required.
Configurations of various types of FBC boilers are shown in Figs. 2.102.12.
Combustion of other solid fuels, including MSW and RDF, is often accomplished in a boiler with a stoker system.
Fuels of this type generally have specially designed feed systems for supplying and distributing the fuel particles.
Boilers that burn these fuels are also specially designed to interface with the fuel feed system and to burn the fuel as efficiently as possible.
Many boilers that burn solid nonfossil fuels have some type of fossil fuel firing capability.
These auxiliary fuels are used during start-up operations, as a supplementary fuel, or alone when the primary fuel is unavailable.
Nonfossil gaseous fuels that are rich in CO and hydrogen can also be burned in watertube boilers.
These fuels can be generated by the partial combustion of biomass using gasification or pyrolysis techniques.

Fuel oil-fired and natural gas-fired watertube package boilers are subdivided into three classes based on the geometry of the tubes.
The "A" design has two small lower drums and a larger upper drum for steam-water separation.
In the "D" design, which is the most common, the unit has two drums and a large-volume combustion chamber.
The orientation of the tubes in a "D" boiler creates either a left- or right-handed configuration.
For the "O" design, the boiler tube configuration exposes the least amount of tube surface to radiant heat.
Rental units are often "O" boilers because their symmetry is a benefit in transportation.
Figures 2.132.15 show tube configurations for each of these watertube package boiler designs.

2.1.3 Other Combustion Boilers Cast iron boilers are fabricated from a number of cast iron sections that are bolted together.
The design of each section includes integral water and combustion gas passages.
When fully assembled, the interconnecting passages create chambers where heat is transferred from the hot combustion gases to the water.
These boilers generally produce low-pressure steam (15 psig) or hot water (30 psig) and burn either oil or natural gas.
Only about 12% of the cast iron boilers in the United States are fired by coal.
Because of their construction, cast iron boilers are limited to smaller sizes.
Only 37% have heat input capacities greater than 0.4 MBtu/h (Ref. 5).
Because the components of these boilers are relatively small and easy to transport, they can be assembled inside a room with a conventional-size doorway.
This feature means that cast iron boilers are often used as replacement units, which eliminate the need for temporary wall removal to provide access for larger package units.
Cast iron boilers represent only about 10% of the ICI boiler capacity in the United States.
The configuration of a cast iron boiler is shown in Fig. 2.16.
Another boiler that is sometimes used to produce steam or hot water in known as a tubeless boiler.
The design of tubeless boilers incorporates nested pressure vessels with water located between the shells.5 Combustion gases are fired into the inner vessel where heat is transferred to water located between the outside surface of the inner shell and the inside surface of the outer shell.
For oil-fired and natural-gas-fired vertical tubeless boilers, the burner is typically located at the bottom of the boiler and fires into the inner pressure vessel.
The configuration of a vertical tubeless boiler is shown in Fig. 2.17.

2.2 FUEL FEED SYSTEMS Fuel feed systems play a critical role in the performance of low-emission boilers.
Their primary functions include (1) transferring the fuel into the boiler and (2) distributing the fuel within the boiler to promote uniform and complete combustion.
The type of fuel and whether the fuel is a solid, liquid, or gas influences the operational features of a fuel feed system.
Gaseous fuels are relatively easy to transport and handle.
Any pressure difference will cause gas to flow, and most gaseous fuels mix easily with air.
Because on-site storage of gaseous fuel is generally not feasible, boilers must be connected to a fuel source such as a natural gas pipeline.
Flow of gaseous fuel to a boiler can be precisely controlled using a variety of control systems.
These systems generally include automatic valves that meter gas flow through a burner and into the boiler based on steam or hot water demand.
The purpose for the burner is to increase the stability of the flame over a wide range of flow rates by creating a favorable condition for fuel ignition and establishing aerodynamic conditions that ensure good mixing between the primary combustion air and the fuel.
Burners are the central elements of 2-18 an effective combustion system.
Other elements of their design and application include equipment for fuel preparation and air-fuel distribution as well as a comprehensive system of combustion controls.
Like gaseous fuels, liquid fuels are also relatively easy to transport and handle by using pumps and piping networks that link the boiler to a fuel supply such as a fuel oil storage tank.
To promote complete combustion, liquid fuels must be atomized to allow thorough mixing with combustion air.
Atomization by air, steam, or pressure produces tiny droplets that burn more like gas than liquid.
Control of boilers that burn liquid fuels can also be accomplished using a variety of control systems that meter fuel flow.
Solid fuels are much more difficult to handle than gaseous and liquid fuels.
Preparing the fuel for combustion is generally necessary and may involve techniques such as crushing or shredding.
Before combustion can occur, the individual fuel particles must be transported from a storage area to the boiler.
Mechanical devices such as conveyors, augers, hoppers, slide gates, vibrators, and blowers are often used for this purpose.
The method selected depends primarily on the size of the individual fuel particles and the properties and characteristics of the fuel.
Stokers are commonly used to feed solid fuel particles such as crushed coal, TDF, MSW, wood chips, and other forms of biomass into boilers.
Mechanical stokers evolved from the hand-fired boiler era and now include sophisticated electromechanical components that respond rapidly to changes in steam demand.
The design of these components provides good turndown and fuel-handling capability.
In this context, turndown is defined as the ratio of maximum fuel flow to minimum fuel flow.
Although stokers are used for most solid fuels, PC combustion, which consists of very fine particles, does not involve a stoker.
Coal in this form can be transported along with the primary combustion air through pipes that are connected to specially designed burners.
The following discussions about stokers and burners are only intended to provide background information about these devices.
Because the characteristics of stokers and burners are very complex and highly technical, the information does not address detailed issues associated with their design, construction, theory of operation, or performance.
Because of concerns about revealing proprietary information, these discussions are intentionally generic in nature.
Specific details about a particular product or design should be obtained from the manufacturer.
2.2.1 Stokers Firing systems that involve stokers must be integrated into the overall boiler design to optimize combustion and heat recovery while minimizing unburned fuel and atmospheric emissions.
Modern mechanical stokers consist of (1) a fuel admission system, (2) a stationary or moving grate assembly that supports the burning fuel and provides a pathway for the primary combustion air, (3) an overfire air (OFA) system that supplies additional air to complete combustion and minimize atmospheric emissions, and (4) an ash discharge system.12 Stoker-firing systems are typically categorized as either underfeed or overfeed stokers.
2.2.1.1 Underfeed stokers Underfeed stokers supply both fuel and primary combustion air from beneath the grate.
The fuel is moved into a hopper and onto the grate by either a screw or ram-driven mechanism.
As the fuel moves out over the grate where it is exposed to air and radiant heat, it begins to burn.
During the combustion process, ash accumulates.
To reduce the tendency for clinker formation, it is sometimes necessary to use moving grates that agitate the burning fuel bed.
The two basic types of underfeed stokers are the (1) horizontal-feed, side-ash discharge type and (2) the less popular gravity-feed, rear-ash discharge type.12 The cross section of an underfeed, side-ash discharge stoker is shown in Fig. 2.18.
Because of cost and environmental considerations, the demand for underfeed stokers has diminished.

2.2.1.2 Overfeed stokers Overfeed stokers are generally classified as either mass-feed or spreader stokers.
These designations reflect the way that the fuel is distributed and burned within the boiler.
Mass-feed stokers introduce fuel continuously at one end of a grate.
As the fuel moves into the boiler, it falls onto the grate by gravity.
The height of the fuel bed is controlled in two ways.
A gate can be moved up or down to regulate the amount of fuel that is allowed to enter the boiler, and the speed at which the fuel moves beneath the gate can be adjusted.
Inside the boiler, the fuel burns as it travels along the grate.
Ash that forms and remains on the grate is discharged at the opposite end.
Primary combustion air flows upward from beneath the grate and through the burning bed of fuel.
The two primary mass-feed stokers are (1) water-cooled vibrating grate and (2) moving (chain and traveling) grate stokers.12 Cross sections of (1) an overfeed, water-cooled, vibrating-grate, mass-feed stoker and (2) an overfeed, watercooled, traveling-grate, mass-feed stoker are shown in Figs. 2.19 and 2.20, respectively.
Spreader stokers are very versatile and the most commonly used stoker.
They are capable of distributing fuel evenly and to a uniform depth over the entire grate surface by using a device that propels the individual fuel particles into the air above the grate.
Methods used to propel the fuel particles include air injection and underthrow and overthrow rotors.
As the fuel is thrown into the boiler, fines ignite and burn in suspension.
Because of suspension burning, response time of spreader stokers is better than massfeed or underfeed stokers.
The coarser particles fall onto the grate and burn in a thin bed.
Primary combustion air is supplied from an air plenum located beneath the grate.
The OFA ports supply the additional air that is needed to complete the combustion process.
Grates for spreader stokers are generally designed to move rather than remain stationary.
Traveling grates, air-cooled vibrating grates, and water-cooled vibrating grates are designs that have been used successfully.

Spreader stokers with stationary water-cooled grates are used primarily in the sugar industry to burn bagasse.
Modern boilers with spreader stokers consist of Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ units that distribute fuel uniformly over the grate, specially designed air-metering grates, dust collection and reinjection equipment, blowers for OFA, forced draft fans for both undergrate and OFA, and combustion controls to coordinate fuel and air supply with steam demand.12 2-21 Fig. 2.21.

2.2.2 Burners A burner is defined as a device or group of devices for the introduction of fuel and air into a furnace at the required velocities, turbulence, and concentration to maintain ignition and combustion of fuel within the furnace.
Burners for gaseous fuels are less complex than those for liquid or solid fuels because mixing of gas and combustion air is relatively simple compared to atomizing liquid fuel or dispersing solid fuel particles.
There is no formal classification system for burners, but attempts to combine desirable burner characteristics have given rise to a rich diversity in burner designs.13 Terminology used to identify burners that have been in existence for a long time as well as advanced burners that are based on emerging technology is listed in Table 2.3.
The ability of a burner to mix combustion air with fuel is a measure of its performance.
A good burner mixes well and liberates a maximum amount of heat from the fuel.
The best burners are engineered to liberate the maximum amount of heat from the fuel and limit the amount of pollutants such as CO, NOx, and PM that are released.
Burners with these capabilities are now used routinely in boilers that must comply with mandated emission limitations.
Emission control techniques that are effective in reducing NOx, CO, SO2, and PM emissions are described in Chap. 5.
An effective way to minimize NOx emissions is to use a low-NOx burner (LNB).
These burners employ various strategies for mixing the fuel with combustion air to reduce the formation of NOx.
Two 2-23 Table 2.3.
Terminology used to identify burners Air-atomizing oil burner Atmospheric gas burner Dual-fuel burner Forced internal recirculation (FIR) burner Low-NOx burner (LNB) Modulating gas power burner Modulating pressure-atomizing oil burner Multistage pressure-atomizing oil burner On-off burner Premix burner Premix radiant burner Premix surface burner Premix surface-stabilized burner PC burner Rapid-mix burner Rotary cup oil burner Single-stage gas power burner Single-stage pressure-atomizing oil burner Staged gas power burner Steam-atomizing oil burner Ultra low-NOx burner (ULNB) techniques often used for this purpose include (1) introducing the fuel and air at different stages, and (2) recirculating flue gas with fresh combustion air.
The LNBs that can be retrofitted to existing boilers have been developed and are currently being marketed.
Complete systems that integrate LNBs into new and efficient boiler designs are also available.
Ultra low-NOx burners (ULNBs) use emerging technology to reduce NOx and CO emissions to extremely low levels.
These burners are specifically designed to burn clean gaseous fuels such as natural gas that are essentially free of fuel-bound nitrogen.
Discussions about ULNBs and the techniques used to minimize thermal and prompt NOx formation are presented in Sect. 5.2.1.6.
Many vendors of conventional LNBs and ULNBs are members of the ABMA.
This organization represents the manufacturers of commercial, industrial, and utility steam-generating and fuel-burning equipment, as well as suppliers to the industry.
In general, technical information about the design of a particular LNB and its in-service performance can only be obtained from the manufacturer.
2.3 EMISSION RATES Use of boilers for steam and hot water production is not limited to any particular geographic location.
Consequently, atmosphere emissions resulting from fuel combustion can affect the human and natural environment over a wide area.14 In the United States, emissions of air pollutants from boilers are regulated under the CAA.15 This federal legislation was amended in 1990 to address specific concerns about ground-level ozone, the accumulation of fine particles in the atmosphere, the development of acid rain, the acidification of aquatic systems, HAPs, and visibility limitations.
To effectively achieve national ambient air quality goals, EPA is authorized to establish maximum emission rates for selected pollutants from new and existing steam-generating units.
This action ensures that some level of emission control is applied in all areas, irrespective of ambient air quality considerations.
The degree of emissions limitation is achieved through the application of the best system of emission reduction, which has been adequately 2-24 demonstrated.
Such systems are referred to as Best Available Control Technology (BACT).
Conditions under which reasonably available control technology (RACT), BACT, and lowest achievable emissions rate (LAER) must be applied are discussed in Chap. 4.
State and local governments are also authorized to establish emission limits that are more stringent than federal requirements.
Major emissions from combustion boilers include NOx, SO2, CO, and PM.
The amount of each pollutant discharged into the atmosphere is influenced by factors such as the fuel consumed and the method by which it is fired, the design features of the boiler, the way the boiler is operated, and the completeness of combustion.
Achieving the required emissions reductions involves the use of precombustion, combustion, or postcombustion emission control techniques, or a combination of techniques.
Emissions limitations that have been established by EPA for electric utility and ICI steamgenerating units are summarized in Appendix A.
One of the main reasons for selecting and installing low-emission boilers and combustion equipment is to reduce NOx, SO2, CO, and PM emissions.
As discussed in Sect. 4.1, it may also be necessary in the near future to reduce HAP emissions from certain combustion boilers.
Although suitable control techniques for reducing emissions vary from one unit to another, assessing the effectiveness of a particular technique requires knowledge about uncontrolled and controlled emission rates.
From a regulatory viewpoint, maximum allowable emissions rates are typically specified in units of pounds per million British thermal units of heat input or as a percent of theoretical emissions.
2.3.1 Uncontrolled Emissions Theoretical or uncontrolled emissions are defined as emissions that would result from combustion of a fuel in an uncleaned state without emission controls.
The term used by EPA to quantify uncontrolled emissions is potential combustion concentration.16 For utility boilers with at least 250-MBtu/h heat input capacity, EPA has defined the following potential combustion concentrations for specific types of fuel.
For PM: Ã¯Â¿Â½ 7.0-lb/MBtu heat input for solid fuels Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0.17-lb/MBtu heat input for liquid fuels For Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ NOx: 0.67-lb/MBtu heat input for gaseous fuels 0.72-lb/MBtu heat input for liquid fuels 2.30-lb/MBtu heat input for solid fuels Currently, there are no corresponding potential combustion concentrations for NOx and PM emissions from ICI boilers.
However, EPA has developed emission factors for a variety of pollutants emitted from external combustion sources, including SO2 and HAPs.17 External combustion sources include steam-generating plants for electricity, industrial boilers, and commercial and domestic combustion units.
These emission factors are cited in numerous EPA publications and appear in various electronic databases.
The process details and supporting reference materials on which these data are based have been compiled and published.17 Uncontrolled emissions from combustion sources depend on the composition of the fuel and the type of boiler.
For example, for SO2, the emission factor representing uncontrolled emissions from a spreader stoker-fired boiler that burns bituminous coal is 38S lb/ton of coal, where S is the weight percent sulfur content of coal as fired.
Ranges of uncontrolled NOx emissions are reported in ABMA and EPA publications.5,6,17 Data reported in these sources provide valuable insight into the level of emissions that can be expected from different types of boilers and combustion equipment.
Although NOx emission factors for many boiler and fuel combinations are listed, it is not always possible to make meaningful data comparisons.
Variations in reporting methods, presentation formats, and boiler classification schemes account for some of the 2-25 uncertainty.
Accurate determinations of NOx emissions are most reliably obtained using standardized testing methods designed to minimize the influence of boiler design, method of firing, condition of combustion equipment, operational characteristics, fuel composition, and various other site-specific parameters on the test results.
Test methods for determining NOx emissions are published by ASTM and EPA.1825 These methods describe analytical techniques and procedures that are suitable for specific applications.
Uncontrolled emissions of SO2 are directly influenced by the amount of sulfur contained in the fuel.
Natural gas contains essentially no sulfur, while other fuels such as coal and fuel oil often contain significant amounts of sulfur-bearing compounds.
Test methods for determining the sulfur content of coal, fuel oil, and liquefied petroleum (LP) gas are referenced in applicable fuel specifications published by ASTM.2628 Results of sulfur-content testing are useful in evaluating potential SO2 emissions because any sulfur in fuel that is not removed along with the ash oxidizes to SO2.
Test methods for determining SO2 emissions are published by EPA.25,2932 The PM emissions are a function of the noncombustible material or ash contained in the fuel.
As with SO2, test methods for determining the ash content of coal, fuel oil, and LP gas are referenced in applicable fuel specifications published by ASTM.2628 Results of ash-content testing are useful in evaluating potential PM emissions because all noncombustible materials that enter the boiler and are not removed as ash become PM emissions.
Test methods for determining PM emissions are published by EPA.25,3335 2.3.2 Controlled Emissions In the United States, emissions of NOx, SO2, and PM from most utility and ICI boilers must be controlled by the application of one or more emission control techniques.
Because there is no practical way to totally eliminate all emissions from fuel combustion, emission limits have been established to address a variety of concerns about atmospheric pollution on the human and natural environment.
These limits, which are specified in units of pounds per million British thermal units or as a percent of potential combustion concentration, are based on federal and, in certain cases, more stringent state emissions standards.
Discussions about emission limits in federal regulations are presented in Chap. 4.
Descriptions of emission control techniques are presented in Chap. 5.

FUELS, EMISSIONS, AND EFFICIENCY Conversion of water to steam requires sufficient heat to cause the water to boil.
Although a variety of energy sources, including nuclear energy and solar radiation, can produce the required amount of heat, combustion of a fuel in the presence of oxygen is the most common source.
Combustion is a rapid chemical reaction between oxygen and a solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel.
Oxygen required for this reaction is readily available in the air.
As air and fuel are mixed at elevated temperatures, the oxygen reacts with carbon, hydrogen, and other elements in the fuel to produce heat.
As long as fuel and air are both available, combustion will continue, and heat will be generated.
Heat produced during combustion is useful for a wide variety of applications; however, atmospheric emissions, which are also generated as by-products of the combustion process, must be controlled.
Common gaseous emissions include SO2, NOx, water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), and CO.
The principle solid by-product of combustion is ash, the inorganic residue remaining after ignition of combustible materials.
Discussions that follow focus on fuels commonly fired in boilers to generate steam or hot water, atmospheric emissions associated with fuel combustion, and factors that influence how effectively the energy content of the fuel is transferred into usable heat.
3.1 FUELS Many different solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels are fired in boilers.
Sometimes, combinations of fuels are used to reduce emissions or improve boiler performance.
Fuels commonly fired in boilers include fossil, biomass, and RDFs as well as other types of fuels and fuel combinations.
Coal, petroleum-based oils, and natural gas are fossil fuels commonly fired in ICI boilers.
However, other forms of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from these fossil fuels are sometimes included in this category.
One of these fuels, which is referred to as tire-derived fuel (TDF), consists of shredded vehicle tires.
Another boiler fuel is referred to as biomass.
Biomass is renewable organic matter.
Examples of biomass include fast-growing trees and plants, wood and wood waste, agricultural crops and residue, aquatic plants and algae, animal wastes, and organic municipal and industrial wastes.
RDF is a potentially valuable energy source.
It consists of MSW that has been processed using size reduction and material recovery techniques to eliminate materials such as aluminum, steel, glass, plastic, and rock.
Common types of fuels fired in boilers are listed in Table 3.1 with key properties provided in Table 3.2.
Additional information about some of the more common fuels is presented in the remainder of this section.
3.1.1 Coal Coal is a brown-to-black combustible, sedimentary rocklike material composed primarily of consolidated and chemically altered plant material that grew in prehistoric forests.1 The chemical composition of coal varies from one location to another, depending on the vegetation from which it was formed and the environmental conditions (such as temperature and pressure) to which the formation was exposed.
In addition to its major chemical constituents of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, coal also contains some water and impurities of which ash, mercury, and sulfur are major concerns from an emissions viewpoint.
3-1 Table 3.1.

These properties are determined by laboratory analysis of representative coal samples using test methods established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM).
Important coal properties include9 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ moisture; proximate analysis (fixed carbon, volatile matter, ash); ultimate analysis (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and chlorine); gross caloric value (as received and on a dry basis); mineral matter in coal (ash, major and minor elements, fusibility of ash, trace elements, mercury, fluorine, arsenic, selenium, and sulfur in ash); petrographic analysis; grindability; free-swelling index; CO2; forms of sulfur (pyritic, sulfate, organic); and ash abrasiveness.
The chemical composition of coal is also determined in a laboratory by chemical analysis.
Results of these analyses are used for heat-balance calculations and the determination of theoretical air requirements.
3-3 Moisture represents an impurity that adds to the weight of coal but not to its heating value.
The moisture may be a constituent of the coal, or it may be present on the surface of the coal because of precipitation or coal cleaning operations.
Moisture content, which is expressed as a percentage, is defined as the difference between the weight of a coal sample before and after the sample is maintained in an oven at 220Ã¯Â¿Â½F for 1 h.
When moisture in coal is heated, some of the heat generated by the combustion process must be used to convert the water to steam.
Normally it is more economical to burn coal with a low moisture content; but when coal is burned on certain grates, there are conditions that make it advantageous to have small amounts of moisture present.
Moisture tends to accelerate the combustion process, keep the fuel bed even, and promote uniform burning.
Coals having 7 to 12% moisture content are recommended for use in chain-grate and traveling-grate stokers.10 The addition of moisture to coal to enhance the combustion process is referred to as tempering.
When coal is heated, the gaseous substance that is driven off is "volatile matter."
This matter, which consists mostly of hydrocarbon gases, burns in the combustion space above the fuel.
Coal with a relatively high percentage of volatile matter is termed "soft;" whereas coal with a relatively low percentage of volatile matter is termed "hard."
When soft coal is burned in a pulverized form, the volatile matter is distilled off and burns as a gas.
This makes soft coal relatively easy to burn because ignition is maintained and complete combustion is achieved with minimum flame travel.
Combustion of pulverized hard coal, which has less volatile matter, is more difficult to accomplish.
To improve combustion, it may be necessary to pulverize hard coals with low volatility to a smaller particle size compared to soft coals or use more intense firing methods.
Inert solid matter that remains after combustion is called ash.
It includes mineral or inorganic material, such as silica, that was introduced as the coal was being formed.
Clay, silt, sand, shale, slate, and pyrite particles are other ash-forming materials commonly found in the stratified layers of coal seams.
Because ash is inert, coal with a high ash content may have a lower heating value.
Although ash is usually considered a waste product that must be transported for disposal, it can have value as a construction material.
For example, fly ash has been used as a base for roadways, structural fill, waste stabilization, soil modification, and backfill.
Fly ash that is produced in some coal-fired boilers may be suitable for use as a mineral admixture in concrete if it satisfies chemical and physical specification requirements established by the ASTM.11 Ash from certain coal combustion processes is also used in the manufacture of concrete masonry units.
Sulfur is an impurity in coal that occurs in three forms: (1) organic sulfur, which is part of the plant's molecular structure; (2) pyritic sulfur, which occurs as iron sulfide and is better known as the mineral pyrite; and (3) sulfate sulfur, which is primarily from iron sulfate.10 The highest sulfur source is from sulfates found in some freshwater and seawater.
Bituminous coals that are found in the interior of the United States where oceans once covered the region are high in sulfur.
When selecting coal and the equipment used for its combustion, consideration must be given to the sulfur content of the coal.
The corrosive effects of sulfur can influence material selection, and the amount of SO2 that is discharged into the atmosphere can dictate the need for pollution control equipment.
In particularly corrosive environments such as those where low-temperature flue gas is present, corrosion-resistant materials are sometimes specified to minimize or avoid corrosion damage.
For new units, installation of SO2 scrubbing systems that remove more than 90% of the SO2 in the flue gas may also be required, depending on the sulfur content of the coal.
Switching from high- to low-sulfur coal can be an effective method for existing units to deal with sulfur-related issues.
A classification system for distinguishing one coal from another has been established by the ASTM.
This system covers anthracitic, bituminous, subbituminous, and lignitic coals.12 Classification is according to fixed carbon and gross caloric value expressed in British thermal units per pound (Btu/lb).
Higher-ranking coals with at least 69% fixed carbon are classified on the dry basis.
Lower ranking coals with a caloric value up to 14,000 Btu/lb are classified on the moist basis.
The ASTM has established standard test methods for use in classifying coal.1317 The four classes of coals and their associated groups are identified and summarized in the following paragraphs.
3-4 3.1.1.1 Lignite Lignite is the lowest ranking coal with a heating value of 8,300 Btu/lb or less and a moisture content as high as 35%.10 Depending on the caloric value, lignitic coals are subdivided into the two classes shown in Table 3.3.
Lignitic coals have a high content of volatile matter, which makes them relatively easy to ignite, especially when the combustion air is preheated.
Because lignite has a relatively low sulfur content, it emits low amounts of SO2.
Table 3.3.
Lignite coals Gross caloric value limits (Btu/lb) (moist, mineral-matter-free basis) Equal or greater than Lignite A (abbreviated ligA) Lignite B (abbreviated ligB) Source: Ref. 12.
Class/group Less than 8,300 6 ,3 0 0 6,300 No limit 3.1.1.2 Subbituminous Subbituminous coals, which have a heating value between 8,300 and 11,500 Btu/lb, have a higher heating value than lignitic coals.
They also have less ash and burn cleaner than lignitic coals, but the moisture content is relatively high, usually between 15 and 30%.
Subbituminous coals are subdivided into three classes based on the caloric values listed in Table 3.4.
The sulfur content of most subbituminous coal is low, generally less than 1%.
Because the sulfur content is low, many power plants have changed to subbituminous coal to limit SO2 emissions.10 Lowsulfur coals, which are mined in Montana and Wyoming, are relatively low in cost.
Combustion of subbituminous coal results in reduced NOx emissions, but generally exhibits high fouling and slagging ash characteristics.
Burning subbituminous coal in a boiler that was designed for a different class of coal may require changes in the boiler design or operation to optimize performance.
Table 3.4.
Subbituminous coals Gross caloric value limits (Btu/lb) (moist, mineral-matter-free basis) Equal or greater than Subbituminous A (abbreviated subA) Subbituminous B (abbreviated subB) Subbituminous C (abbreviated subC) Source: Ref. 12.
Class/group Less than 11,500 10,500 9,500 10,500 9,500 8,300 3.1.1.3 Bituminous Bituminous coals are used routinely by electric utilities and in some industrial applications to fire steam-generating boilers even though their sulfur content can be relatively high.
Compared to lignitic and subbituminous coals, the heating value of bituminous coals range between 10,500 and 14,000 Btu/lb.
This higher heating value and its relatively high volatile matter enable bituminous coals to burn easily when fired as PC.
Bituminous coals are subdivided into the following groups in Table 3.5 based on fixed carbon, volatile matter, or gross caloric limits.
3-5 Table 3.5.
Bituminous coals Fixed carbon limits (%) (dry, mineral-matter-free basis) Equal or greater than 78 69 No limit No limit No limit Less than 86 78 69 No limit No limit Volatile matter limits (%) (dry, mineral-matter-free basis) Greater than 14 22 31 No limit No limit Equal or less than 22 31 No limit No limit No limit Gross caloric value limits (Btu/lb) (moist, mineral-matter-free basis) Equal or greater than No limit No limit 1 4 ,0 0 0 1 3 ,0 0 0 11,500 (commonly agglomerating) 10,500 (agglomerating) Less than No limit No limit No limit 1 4 ,0 0 0 13,000 (commonly agglomerating) 11,500 (agglomerating) Class/group Low-volatile bituminous coal (abbreviated lvb) Medium-volatile bituminous coal (abbreviated mvb) High-volatile A bituminous coal (abbreviated hvAb) High-volatile B bituminous coal (abbreviated hvBb) High-volatile C bituminous coal (abbreviated hvCb) Source: Ref. 12.
3-6 3.1.1.4 Anthracite As a fuel, anthracitic coals are the highest ranking with fixed carbon contents ranging from 86 to 98%.
In addition to their high carbon content, they have a moisture content that is only about 3% and a heating value that can be as high as 15,000 Btu/lb.
Anthracitic coals are characterized as slow-burning fuels that are low in sulfur and volatile matter.
These coals are used mostly to make coke for metallurgical processes.10 Anthracitic coals are subdivided into the following groups in Table 3.6 based on their fixed carbon and volatile matter content.
Table 3.6.
Anthracitic coals Fixed carbon limits (%) (dry, mineral-matter-free basis) Equal or greater than 98 92 86 Less than No limit 98 92 Volatile matter limits (%) (dry, mineral-matter-free basis) Greater than No limit 2 8 Equal or less than 2 8 14 Class/group Meta-anthracite (abbreviated ma) Anthracite (abbreviated an) Semianthracite (abbreviated sa) Source: Ref. 12.
If the quality of coal from a particular location does not meet the applicable fuel specification, it can be processed in different ways to upgrade its quality.
Operations such as washing, drying, sizing, and blending of coals from different sources are techniques that may be used to produce acceptable coal, but other methods that involve separation of foreign materials such as slate and pyrites from the coal may be necessary.
Although one or more of these methods may produce coal with the desired quality, special equipment may be required to perform the operations.
3.1.2 Fuel Oil Petroleum is a naturally occurring black liquid found floating on subterranean lakes of saltwater and located beneath dome-shaped nonporous rock formations.
These deposits consist of natural gas, crude oil, and saltwater separated into layers by virtue of their difference in specific gravity.
When a well is drilled through the rock formation, natural gas flows to the surface where it is either burned or transported by pipeline to a processing facility.
Depending on the pressure, the crude oil either flows to the surface or is removed by pumping.
Once above ground, the crude oil is transported by pipeline, truck, rail, barge, or ship to a refinery.
At the refinery, the crude oil is processed into any number of petroleumbased products, including fuel oils.
Fuel oils burned in boilers include the heavier petroleum products that are less volatile than gasoline.
They are divided into two classes, distillate and residual.
Distillate oils are lighter than residual oils with a consistency between kerosene and lubricating oil.
They have a low viscosity and are typically sediment- and ash-free.
Because distillate oils are relatively clean fuels, they are used primarily for home heating and industrial applications where low ash and low sulfur are important.
Smaller amounts of distillate oil are used in steam generation applications as a startup or supplemental fuel for certain solid-fuel combustion processes.
Residual oils are products that remain after the more volatile hydrocarbons have been extracted.
Residual oils, which are highly viscous, are usually free from moisture and sediment after processing.
Some of the heavier residual oils must be heated to make the fuel easier to handle and burn.
Sometimes, distillate and residual oils are blended to create a mixture with proportions that meet a desired fuel specification.
As a liquid, fuel oils are relatively easy to handle and burn.
In most oil burners, 3-7 the oil is atomized with air, steam, or pressure to enhance combustion.
The characteristics of atomized oil approximate those of natural gas.10 The heating value of fuel oil is derived primarily from its two major constituents, hydrogen and carbon.
Most fuel oils have a hydrogen content that ranges between 10 and 14%, and a carbon content that ranges between 86 and 90%.18 Heating values for fuel oils are expressed in units of either British thermal unit per pound (Btu/lb) or per gallon (Btu/gal) at 60Ã¯Â¿Â½F.
Complete combustion of 1 lb of carbon yields a gross heat of 14,500 Btu.19 Hydrogen has a very high heating value compared to carbon; but it is a very lightweight gas, so the heating value of 1 ft3 of hydrogen is low compared to other gaseous fuels.
Heating values for commercial fuel oils vary from approximately 17,500 to nearly 20,000 Btu/lb.18 Other constituents in fuel oils include nitrogen, sulfur, ash, and impurities such as moisture and sediment.
Compared to coal, the nitrogen and ash contents of most fuel oils are very low.
Residual oils tend to have higher nitrogen contents than distillate oils.
A standard specification for five grades of fuel oil intended for use in different types of fuel-oilburning equipment under various climatic and operating conditions has been developed by the ASTM.5 Requirements in this specification cover both distillate and residual oils.
The various grade numbers into which fuel oils are subdivided are listed in Table 3.7.
Fuel oil Grade No. 2 is considered a premium steam-generating fuel because its cleanliness and ease of handling are often used to justify its relatively high cost.
The cost of Grade No. 6 fuel oil is relatively low, but heating of the fuel is required to facilitate handling and burning.
Sulfur found in fuel oil is very undesirable.
Its products of combustion are very acidic and can cause corrosion in economizers, air heaters, induced draft fans, flue gas ducts, and stacks.
The sulfur content of fuel oil can vary from a low of 0.01% for Grade No. 1 to as high as 3.5% for Grade No. 6 (Ref. 18).
During combustion, some of the sulfur accumulates in the ash, but most is discharged with the flue gas into the atmosphere.
If uncontrolled SO2 emissions exceed established limits, it may be necessary to switch to a lower sulfur oil or install SO2 scrubbers to meet applicable emissions standards.
3.1.3 Natural Gas Natural gas is a colorless hydrocarbon fuel consisting primarily of methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6), its two principle combustible components.
It is typically found under the earth's surface in porous rock and shale formations or above crude oil deposits located beneath dome-shaped nonporous rock formations.
When a well is drilled through the formation, natural gas, which is under pressure, flows to the surface where it is either burned or transported by pipeline to a processing facility.
This characteristic makes natural gas a very desirable boiler fuel because it can be piped directly into the boiler.
In addition to its ease of distribution, use of natural-gas-fired boilers requires a relatively small boiler space, and the overall plant design is typically compact and simple.
With a heating value of about 1,000 Btu/ft3 under standard conditions of 60Ã¯Â¿Â½F at atmospheric pressure and low excess-air requirements that contribute to high efficiency, natural gas is perhaps very close to an ideal fuel.
When natural gas at the well head contains sulfur-bearing alcohols and phenols (mercaptans) and a high percentage of hydrogen sulfide, it is referred to as sour gas.
By removing the objectionable constituents, sour gas can be converted to sweet gas.
Sweet gas is required for distribution in pipelines to avoid corrosion problems caused by exposure to hydrogen sulfide.
Removal of sulfur from the gas also eliminates the possibility of SO2 emissions during combustion.
From an emissions viewpoint, natural gas is an excellent fuel choice.
Although natural gas from some sources contains noncombustible gases such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, it is practically free from solid residue.
Because it is free of ash and mixes easily with air, combustion is usually complete without objectionable smoke or soot.
The only significant problem with using natural gas as a fuel for boilers is related to its chemical composition.
Natural gas has a relatively high hydrogen content (greater than 20% by weight) compared to other fossil fuels such as oil and coal.
During combustion, the 3-8 Table 3.7.
Fuel oil grades established by ASTM Fuel oil Grade No. 1 Description Distillate fuel for use in domestic and small industrial burners.
This grade is particularly adapted to vaporizing burners in which the oil is converted to a vapor by contact with a heated surface or by radiation or where storage conditions require low-pour-point fuel.
High volatility is necessary to ensure that evaporation proceeds with a minimum of residue.
The maximum allowable sulfur content is 0.5% by mass.
The maximum allowable ash content is not specified.
Distillate fuel that is heavier than Grade No. 1.
It is intended for use in atomizing burners that spray the oil into a combustion chamber where the tiny droplets burn while in suspension.
This grade of fuel oil is used in most domestic burners and in many medium-capacity commercial-industrial burners where its ease of handling and ready availability sometimes justify its higher cost over residual fuels.
The maximum allowable sulfur content is 0.5% by mass.
The maximum allowable ash content is not specified.
Heavy distillate fuel or distillate/residual fuel blend used in commercial/industrial burners equipped for this viscosity range.
This grade of fuel oil is intended for use both in pressure-atomizing commercial-industrial burners not requiring higher cost distillates and in burners equipped to atomize oils of higher viscosity.
Its permissible viscosity range allows it to be pumped and atomized at relatively low storage temperatures.
The maximum allowable sulfur content is not specified.
The maximum allowable ash content is 0.05% by mass.
Heavy distillate fuel or distillate/residual fuel blend used in commercial/industrial burners equipped for this viscosity range.
This grade of fuel oil is intended for use in burners equipped with devices that atomize oils of higher viscosity than domestic burners can handle.
Its permissible viscosity range allows it to be pumped and atomized at relatively low storage temperatures.
Thus, in all but extremely cold weather it requires no preheating for handling.
The maximum allowable sulfur content is not specified.
The maximum allowable ash content is 0.10% by mass.

Residual fuel oil used in industrial burners with an increased viscosity and boiling range compared to Grade No. 5 (heavy).
Preheating is required for handling and proper atomization.
Extra equipment and maintenance required to handle this fuel usually preclude its use in smaller installations where cleanliness and ease of handling are important.
The maximum allowable sulfur content and the maximum allowable ash content are not specified.

3-9 hydrogen in natural gas combines with oxygen to form water vapor.
As discussed in Sect. 3.3, formation of relatively large quantities of water vapor translates to lower boiler efficiency.
Like natural gas, other types of gases can also be used as fuels for boilers, but their processing costs generally make them too expensive for most large-scale applications.
By-product substitutes for natural gas include producer gas, coke-oven gas, water gas, and blast-furnace gas derived from coal, refinery gas and oil gas derived from oil, and liquefied petroleum (LP) gas, including propane and butane, derived from either natural gas or oil.6 3.1.4 Biomass Biomass is a nonfossil fuel suitable for steam generation in boilers.
It is derived from plant material including wood, bagasse, nut hulls, rice hulls, corncobs, coffee grounds, and tobacco stems.
Use of these by-product materials as fuel can be cost-effective especially when it solves a waste disposal problem.
Wood is a complex vegetable tissue composed principally of cellulose.
Most wood burned in boilers is a by-product from manufacturing operations such as sawmills, paper mills, and factories that manufacture wood products.
By-products from these operations may take the form of bark, sawdust, sanderdust, chips, scraps, slabs, millings, shavings, and processed pellets made from wood or other forest products.
Care must be used when burning fine wood dust because under certain conditions it can ignite quickly.
Depending on the species and moisture content, the heating value of wood varies over a wide range.20 Although certain types of wood are more suitable for steam production, sufficient supplies of the fuel may not always be available.
In these situations, it may be necessary to burn supplementary fuels along with the wood to meet the total steam demand.
Bagasse is a by-product fuel produced when the juice is removed from cane in a sugar mill.
Although its heating value can be as high as 8,000 to 9,000 Btu/lb, combustion of bagasse is only feasible in certain parts of the United States where sugar cane is processed.
When bagasse is burned, it is usually supplemented with auxiliary fuels.
Other biomass fuels include Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ nut hulls with a heating value of about 7,700 Btu/lb, rice hulls with a heating value between 5,200 and 6,500 Btu/lb, corncobs with a heating value between 7,500 to 8,300 Btu/lb, and coffee grounds from instant coffee production with a heating value between 4,900 to 6,500 Btu/lb (Ref. 20).
3.1.5 Refuse-Derived Fuel Residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste that is transported to a landfill for disposal can be burned as a fuel in waste-to-energy boilers.
MSW that contains mixtures of paper, wood, yard wastes, food wastes, plastics, leather, and rubber can have characteristics similar to wood.
Use of MSW as a fuel can be accomplished by burning the as-received material, called mass burning; but processing is often required before it can be burned effectively.
When MSW is processed using size-reduction and materialrecovery techniques designed to shred the waste and remove noncombustible materials, it is called RDF.18 The highly variable nature of MSW presents challenges in designing a combustion system that can accommodate this high-ash, low-sulfur fuel.
3.1.6 Other Fuels Heavy residuals from petroleum-cracking processes yield a solid residue that is suitable for use as a fuel for boilers.18 Solid fuels derived from oil include delayed coke, fluid coke, and petroleum pitch.
Some cokes produced by the delayed coking process are easy to pulverize and burn in boilers.
Fluid 3-10 cokes can also be pulverized and burned in boilers or burned in a cyclone furnace or a fluidized bed, but all three of these methods may require supplemental fuel to aid start-up.
Petroleum pitch yields fuel with varying characteristics.
Low-melting-point pitches can be heated and burned like heavy oil.
Those with higher melting points must be pulverized or crushed and then burned.
Coal tar pitch is the residue resulting from the distillation and refining of coal tar.
Although it can be used as a boiler fuel, it is somewhat difficult to handle.
At ambient temperature, it is a solid that can be pulverized before it is delivered to the boiler.
At about 300Ã¯Â¿Â½F, it becomes a liquid and can be burned like oil.
Because of its low ash content, use of coal tar pitch is sometimes preferable to coal.20 Pulp mill sludge can be used as a fuel for boilers, but it must be dried before it can be effectively burned.
This fuel typically has an ash content of approximately 10%.
Sludges from deinking processes are less suitable because they have less heating value and significantly more ash.
Unless sludge from the deinking process is dried before it enters the boiler, the combination of high moisture content and low heating value make it difficult to burn.
Burning sludge with a high-moisture content in stoker-fired boilers presents some significant problems because removal of the moisture results in a lower combustion chamber temperature.
For this reason, sludge is generally burned in stoker-fired boilers in combination with another fuel such as bark.10 3.1.7 Mixed Fuels Environmental concerns about SO2 and PM emissions from combustion of bituminous coals have led to the development of coal cleaning techniques known as beneficiation.18 These techniques involve removal of sulfur and mineral matter from coal prior to combustion.
To achieve the cleaning level needed to meet sulfur standards, the form of the solid coal must first be altered.
Most advanced cleaning processes use water as the separation medium and involve grinding the coal to fine particle size.
Grinding allows pyritic sulfur and other minerals that are dispersed throughout the coal to be more easily separated from the coal.
After these materials are removed, the fine, clean coal product must be dried, pelletized, or reconstituted into a coal-water slurry, which can be handled like oil prior to combustion in a boiler.
Coal-water slurries have potential as fuel oil substitutes in some combustion applications.
Typical bituminous coal slurries contain approximately 70% PC, 29% water and 1% chemical additives.
Slurries prepared from coals, which have been deep cleaned, can contain coal with finer particle sizes and a lower solids content (50 to 60%).
Although coal-water slurries are produced from fine PC and are handled and fired like No. 6 fuel oil, they burn somewhat differently.
Burners suitable for coal-water slurry combustion are often specially designed to accommodate the unique properties of the slurry.
Viscosity and flow characteristics can affect the way the fuel is atomized and can increase wear and deterioration of piping and burner components.
Oil-water slurries can be used as fuel with combustion performance similar to residual oils.
These liquid-fuel emulsions are composed of micron-size oil droplets dispersed in water.18 Although the heating value, ash content, and viscosity of oil-water slurries are similar to residual oil, they have a relatively high sulfur content.
3.2 EMISSIONS Federal, state, and local government agencies regulate air pollutants emitted from steam generating units in accordance with the CAA.21 This legislation establishes primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six criteria pollutants, including ground-level ozone, NOx, SO2, CO, PM, and lead.22 These standards address concerns about ground-level ozone, the accumulation of fine particles in the atmosphere, and acid rain.
Emissions of criteria pollutants from steam generating units include NOx, SO2, CO, and PM.
The CAA, as amended in 1990, also requires EPA to establish standards for reducing toxic air pollutant emissions.
The 1990 Act includes a list of 189 HAPs selected by Congress on the basis of their 3-11 potential health and environmental hazards, and it authorizes EPA to establish regulations for each of these pollutants.
Toxic air pollutants, also known as HAPs, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects or adverse environmental effects.
To regulate HAPs, EPA has identified categories of sources that release these listed chemicals.
One of these categories includes ICI boilers.
Toxic air pollutants that are emitted during the combustion of certain fuels include metals such as cadmium, mercury, chromium, and lead compounds.
3.2.1 Nitrogen Oxides During the combustion process, NOx is one of the primary pollutants emitted into the atmosphere.
In this context, NOx refers to the cumulative emissions of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and trace quantities of other species as shown in Table 3.8.23 Although mobile sources are the largest contributor to NOx formation in the United States, combustion of any fossil fuel generates some level of NOx because of high temperatures and the availability of oxygen and nitrogen from both the air and fuel.
The NOx emissions from fired processes are typically 90 to 95% NO with the balance being predominantly NO2.
Once the flue gas leaves the stack, the bulk of the emitted NO is eventually oxidized in the atmosphere to NO2.
Dispersed in the atmosphere, NO2 reacts to form secondary pollutants, including ground-level ozone and acid rain.
Chemical reactions between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (hydrocarbon radicals) and NOx create ground-level ozone, which is not to be confused with ozone found in the upper atmosphere.
When these materials react in the presence of sunlight, they form ground-level ozone, a major ingredient of smog.
When NOx reacts with water vapor and air, it forms very dilute nitric acid.
Control of acid rain has focused primarily on reducing SO2 emissions because NOx is estimated to contribute less than one-third of the acid rain generated.
There are two common mechanisms of NOx formation, thermal NOx and fuel NOx (Ref. 18).
Thermal NOx refers to the NOx that formed through high-temperature oxidation of nitrogen found in the combustion air.
Fuel NOx involves the conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen found in nitrogen-bearing fuels, such as coal and oil, to NOx during combustion.
A third type of NOx that forms under certain conditions is known as prompt NOx.
Table 3.8.

3.2.1.1 Thermal NOx The formation rate of thermal NOx is a strong function of temperature as well as the residence time at temperature.
Significant levels of NOx are usually formed above 2,600Ã¯Â¿Â½F.
Above this temperature the rate of thermal NOx increases exponentially.
At these high temperatures, molecular nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) in the combustion air can dissociate into their atomic states and participate in a series of 3-12 reactions.
One product of these reactions is NO.
At temperatures below 1,400Ã¯Â¿Â½F, NO is either generated in much lower concentrations or not at all.23,24 Thermal NOx formation is typically controlled by reducing the peak and average flame temperatures.
Although this approach is contrary to traditional methods of assuring complete combustion (i.e., high temperatures, long residence time, and high turbulence or mixing), some compromise between effective combustion and controlled NOx formation is needed.
This can be accomplished through a number of combustion system changes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use of controlled mixing burners to reduce the turbulence in the near burner region of the flame and to slow the combustion process.
This typically reduces the flame temperature by removing additional energy from the flame before the highest temperature is reached.
Use of staged combustion where part of the combustion air is initially introduced to burn some of the fuel.
The remaining air is added separately to complete the combustion process.
This lowers the peak flame temperature by reducing the oxygen concentration.
Combustion at very low excess air levels is an effective way to control NOx formation.
Use of staged combustion where a portion of the total fuel is added with an excessive amount of combustion air.
The remaining fuel is then added at a later stage in the combustion process.
Combustion at very high excess air levels is an effective way to control NOx formation.
Use of a technique known as flue gas recirculation (FGR) in which some of the flue gas is mixed with the combustion air at the burner.
This increases the gas weight that must be heated by the chemical energy in the fuel, thereby reducing the flame temperature.
Use of multiflame burners and lean premix combustion that breaks the total heat input into smaller flames with effective mixing.
This lowers peak flame temperatures and allows the heat to be removed rapidly by placing the flame in close proximity to the heating surface.
Use of a premixed blend of air and gaseous fuel with the option of adding flue gas to the mixture will cause combustion to occur at a relatively low temperature, thus reducing thermal NOx formation.
Burners that premix gaseous fuel and air to control thermal NOx formation are described in Sect. 5.2.1.6. Use of combinations of these techniques.
These approaches have been used effectively with gas, oil, or coal firing to reduce NOx formation.
For fuels that do not contain significant amounts of chemically bound nitrogen, such as natural gas, thermal NOx is the primary overall contributor to NOx emissions.
In these cases, the approaches previously described are particularly effective in NOx emission control.
3.2.1.2 Fuel NOx The major source of NOx emissions from nitrogen-bearing fuels such as coal and oil is the conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen to NO during combustion.
Laboratory studies indicate that fuel NOx contributes approximately 50% of the total uncontrolled emissions when firing residual oil and more than 80% when firing coal.18 Nitrogen found in fuels such as coal and residual oils is typically bound to the fuel as part of organic compounds.
During combustion, the nitrogen is released as a free radical to ultimately form NO or N2.
Although it is a major factor in NOx emissions, only 20 to 30% of the fuel-bound nitrogen is converted to NO.
Conversion of fuel-bound nitrogen to NO is strongly dependent on the fuel-air proportions, but it is relatively independent of variations in combustion zone temperature.
Therefore, reducing oxygen availability during the initial stages of combustion can control this conversion.
Techniques such as controlled fuel-air mixing and staged combustion can provide a significant reduction in NOx emissions.
Removing nitrogen from fuel before it is burned is not easily achieved, but switching from a highnitrogen-content fuel to a lower nitrogen-content fuel may be effective in reducing NOx emissions.
In 3-13 general, coal combustion produces the highest NOx emissions with oil combustion generating less and gas combustion producing the least.
For oil, a reduction in fuel nitrogen results in a decrease in NOx formation; but for coal, reducing fuel nitrogen may not provide a corresponding reduction.
3.2.1.3 Prompt NOx A portion of the NOx that is formed by oxidation of the fuel-bound nitrogen under fuel-rich conditions is referred to as prompt NOx (Ref. 18).
The name is derived from its formation very early during the combustion process.
Prompt NOx occurs through the formation of intermediate hydrogen cyanide (HCN) species and the reaction between molecular nitrogen and hydrocarbon compounds.
This reaction is then followed by the oxidation of HCN to NO.
Although prompt NOx formation normally has a weak temperature dependence, this dependence can become strong under fuel-rich conditions.
Except for burners that fully premix air and gaseous fuel, most burners are designed to reduce peak flame temperatures by controlling the rate of fuel and air mixing.
Combustion is initiated under fuel-rich conditions, and this fuel-rich zone is where prompt NOx is formed.
Prompt NOx can contribute from near zero to more than 100 ppm of NO.
Burners that are capable of controlling prompt NOx formation by premixing fuel and air are described in Sect. 5.2.1.6.
3.2.2 Sulfur Dioxide Sulfur in most fossil fuels is derived primarily from the decay of plant and animal matter.
It originates as hydrogen sulfide, a by-product of the decay process.
Other sources of sulfur in fuel include iron sulfite and iron sulfate.
Combustion of sulfur-bearing fuels results in the creation of SO2.
The two principle industrial sources of sulfur emissions are fossil fuel combustion and metallurgical ore refining.10 When SO2 oxidizes in the atmosphere, it converts to sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
There are two mechanisms by which sulfuric acid is formed.
1.
Gaseous SO2 can combine with liquid water to form a dilute aqueous solution of sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which oxidizes in the atmosphere to form H2SO4.
2.
Gaseous SO2 can also oxidize in the atmosphere to produce gaseous SO3, which combines with water vapor to form H2SO4.
In 1970, the average sulfur content of coal burned by coal-fired power plants was 2.3%.
Between 1970 and 1988, use of coals with less sulfur reduced this average to 1.34% (Ref. 18).
Switching to lowsulfur coals can be an effective way to reduce SO2 emissions and thereby permit utilities to comply with mandated SO2 emissions limitations, but it can have adverse effects on boiler performance.
As an example, consider the potential consequences of switching from eastern bituminous coal, which has a high heating value and low ash content to a low-sulfur western subbituminous coal with a high ash content, and lower heating value.
Flame stability at various loads can be affected, higher slagging and fouling may occur, the ash loading will increase, changes in fuel handling equipment may be required, emissions control equipment may not perform satisfactorily, and emission levels will be different.
If switching to low-sulfur coal is not effective in reducing SO2 emissions to an acceptable level, use of wet or dry scrubbers is often a viable option.
These postcombustion techniques for controlling SO2 emissions are very efficient, and their installation allows continued use of existing fuel sources, thereby making major changes in boiler operations unnecessary.
Depending on the process, by-products from wet scrubbing can include mixtures of calcium sulfate or calcium sulfite that may be sold as gypsum or placed in landfills.10 Other methods that are effective in reducing SO2 emissions include using FBC boilers, reducing the sulfur content of fuel directly, and switching to low-sulfur fuel oil or natural gas.
3-14 Coal cleaning can also be an effective method for lowering SO2 emissions by reducing the amount of sulfur in coal before it is burned.
After coal is mined, crushed, and screened to achieve size segregation, it may be processed using various techniques, including gravity concentration, flotation, and dry processing.18 Gravity concentration is a mechanical cleaning technique that uses the difference in specific gravity of the various coal constituents to separate ash and sulfur from the coal.
Segregation is achieved when the more dense ash and sulfur particles settle farther and faster in a fluid medium than the less dense coal particles of the same size.
The flotation method of coal cleaning uses differences in surface properties to achieve separation.
As air passes over the surfaces of coal particles and mineral matter suspended in an aqueous solution, the coal particles float upward because their surfaces are more difficult to wet.
This method is generally used for cleaning coal finer than 300 Ã¯Â¿Â½m. Dry processing of coal is only suitable for material that has been crushed finer than 0.5 in. and has low surface moisture.
This method involves pneumatic processing to achieve segregation.
3.2.3 Particulate Matter Combustion of any fuel that contains noncombustible material results in the formation of ash.
The ash as well as any unburned carbon particles are referred to collectively as PM or fly ash.
Fine PM includes dust, smoke, and soot, which can be emitted during the combustion of certain fuels such as coal and wood.
Particle size is measured in micrometers or microns (one millionth of a meter).
Depending on the concentration, these fine particles can adversely affect breathing and contribute to poor visibility.
Separate PM emission limitations have been established for particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 Ã¯Â¿Â½m (PM10) and for particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 Ã¯Â¿Â½m (PM2.5).
All coals contain some amount of ash.
Eastern bituminous coals typically contain 5 to 15% ash (by weight), while western subbituminous coals contain 5 to 30% ash.
The ash content of fuel oils varies depending on whether the fuel is residual or distillate oil.
Residual oils have more ash than distillate oils, but both types have much less ash than coal.
Natural gas is essentially ash-free, but it can have some small amount of particulate emissions.
Before flue gas is discharged into the atmosphere, it is often necessary to remove as much of the PM as possible.
Three techniques currently being used for this purpose, either alone or in combination, include: (1) mechanical collectors, (2) electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), and (3) fabric filters.10 3.2.4 Carbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas formed when carbon in fuels is not burned completely.
Highway vehicles produce about 60% of all CO emissions in the United States.
In certain cities, automobile exhaust causes as much as 95% of all CO emissions.
Other sources of CO emissions include industrial processes and fuel combustion in boilers and incinerators.
When combined, emissions from these sources can result in high concentrations of CO, particularly in local areas with heavy traffic congestion.
Control of the combustion process is very important to efficient boiler operation.
Incomplete fuel combustion represents wasted energy and results in increased CO and PM emissions.
Although combustion of liquid and gaseous fuels typically produces very low CO emissions, control of unburned carbon in boilers that burn solid fuel is an important design and operating concern.
Carbon burnout is dependent on fuel properties, boiler and firing system characteristics, and unit operating conditions.
Major factors influencing complete combustion of carbon include Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ fuel reactivity, fuel fineness and particle size, 3-15 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ efficiency of fuel-air mixing, excess air available for complete combustion, residence time, and temperature profile inside the boiler.
To minimize carbon loss, it is important to match these parameters with the fuel's combustion characteristics.
In most instances, the loss due to unburned carbon from coal, wood, and other solid fuel combustion is controllable to below 0.5% of the fuel fired.20 3.2.5 Hazardous Air Pollutants When fuel is burned in a boiler, different types of HAPs can be emitted.
In general, their formation depend on the composition of the fuel and the combustion process.
Three factors that greatly influence the combustion process include time, turbulence, and temperature.
The importance of each factor is a function of the boiler design and the fuel being burned.
Fuel-dependent HAPs can generally be reduced by either changing the composition of the fuel before it is burned or by removing the HAP from the flue gas after combustion occurs.
Emissions of metals such as mercury are released along with PM whenever certain solid fuels are burned.
Installation of a PM collection system is an effective way to reduce mercury emissions.
Acid gases, such as hydrogen chloride, and organic compounds, such as formaldehyde, that can form when fuel combustion is incomplete are released along with the flue gas.
Scrubbers designed to lower SO2 emissions can be effective in reducing these emissions.
In general, larger amounts of organic emissions are produced whenever liquid or gaseous fuels are fired compared to solid fuels.
3.3 EFFICIENCY To minimize the cost of producing steam or hot water, boiler owners and operators are very interested in extracting as much energy from the fuel as possible.
In addition to reducing fuel cost, using energy efficiently is an effective way to reduce emissions.
When less fuel is burned to produce a given amount of steam or hot water, emissions are reduced.
Achieving high efficiency is therefore an important consideration in selecting a low-emission boiler and combustion equipment.
However, many of the methods used to reduce emissions come with a price, either in terms of impact to system efficiency or increased operating cost.25,26 The meaning of the term "efficiency" can sometimes be confusing because there are several ways that efficiency can be quantified.
When determining efficiency, it is important that all forms of heat loss are considered.
Heat loss in this context is energy that is not transferred to the water to increase its energy content but discharged or vented from the system.
The goal is to optimize system performance to increase operational flexibility and to minimize impact on the overall system.
In considering factors that influence boiler performance, note that efficiency is not constant throughout the entire operating range of a boiler.
Peak efficiency generally occurs at a particular boiler output.
Operations that deviate from this output often result in performance that is somewhat below peak efficiency.
Continuous operation at peak efficiency is often impractical because of seasonal demands and load variations, but operation at steady load and avoidance of cyclic or on-off operation can improve efficiency.
However, on-off operation can and will reduce overall energy usage, depending on the output requirements.
While every boiler and burner arrangement will perform somewhat differently, it is possible to project variations in efficiency based on boiler load.
It is important to understand that efficiency loss can vary as much as 10% when operations change from the maximum continuous rating (MCR) to reduced boiler output (30 to 40% of capacity).
The key to increased efficiency involves minimizing all forms of 3-16 combustion and boiler losses.
In addition, the overall system efficiency can be improved with attention to the application and uses of the steam and hot water produced by the boiler.
Improving system efficiency means that less fuel is used to run the entire process, which in turn leads to lower overall emissions.2528 3.3.1 Combustion Losses Combustion efficiency is a measure of the chemical energy available in fuel that is liberated by the combustion process.
Quantifying combustion efficiency involves determining Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ losses from unburned carbon in the flue gas (CO), losses from unburned carbon in the solid residue (bottom ash and fly ash), and losses from unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs) in the flue gases.
In its simplest form, combustion efficiency can be computed using the following equation: Combustion efficiency = 100 (unburned-fuel losses) .
Under perfect combustion conditions, the following phenomena can occur.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ (3.1) Carbon in hydrocarbon fuel combines with oxygen in the combustion air to form CO2.
Hydrogen in the fuel combines with oxygen in the combustion air to form water vapor.
Achieving complete combustion requires precise proportioning of the fuel-air mixture.
Incomplete combustion due to an imbalance in the fuel-to-air ratio can result in significant energy loss that translates to decreased combustion efficiency.
When insufficient combustion air (oxygen) is available for complete fuel combustion, some of the carbon remains unburned.
Incomplete combustion can result in the formation of CO and carbon-laden PM known as soot.
If no additional air is made available to complete the combustion process, two forms of energy are wasted.
Heat is lost from the system as hot CO gas or soot particles leaving the stack, and energy is not extracted from the unburned or partially burned carbon.
Air supplied to a boiler in excess of that required for complete fuel combustion (excess air beyond stoichiometric conditions) is also detrimental to efficiency.
The efficiency reduction results from excess air entering the boiler at ambient temperature and exiting the system at the stack temperature.
3.3.2 Boiler Losses Boiler efficiency is a function of boiler losses and combustion losses.
It can be characterized as the amount of heat captured by the boiler and transferred to the water, divided by the heat that was input.
The heat that was not transferred to the water manifests itself in a number of losses that include Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ flue-gas losses, radiant heat losses, blowdown losses, and unaccounted losses.
Flue-gas losses are often the primary cause for reduced boiler efficiency.
Energy is wasted whenever heated flue gas is carried out of the boiler and up the stack.
Flue-gas temperature is related to boiler load.
In general, as boiler load increases, the flue-gas temperature increases.
Hotter flue-gas temperatures increase flue-gas losses.
Installation of equipment to recover some of this heat can have a beneficial effect on efficiency, but removing too much heat can cause problems such as corrosion, 3-17 especially when water condenses on boiler equipment.
Corrosion of internal boiler components made from certain types of steel, such as carbon steel, can occur at locations where water condenses and combines with other constituents in the flue gas to form acids.
Use of stainless steel or other alloys is sometimes required to avoid these corrosion problems.
For most boiler systems, there is a practical limit that dictates the minimum flue-gas temperature.
Air in excess of that required for complete fuel combustion represents a major flue-gas loss.
Because the fuel supplies energy required to increase the temperature of excess air, controlling the amount of air that is supplied to a boiler has a direct impact on boiler efficiency.
The loss is a function of the amount of excess air that passes through the boiler and the temperature of the excess air that discharges from the stack.
Energy required to raise the temperature of excess air is wasted because it is not used to heat water.
If the water vapor content of the excess air is high, even more energy is required to superheat the water vapor.
Although combustion of any fuel results in some degree of flue-gas loss, solid fuels require more excess air for complete combustion than do gaseous fuels.
Although combustion with insufficient air decreases combustion efficiency, it is a very effective technique for reducing NOx formation.
A lower flame temperature associated with incomplete combustion decreases the amount of thermal NOx that forms.
Selection of a low-emission boiler and combustion equipment often requires a compromise between efficiency and NOx formation.
For greatest efficiency, a boiler should be fitted with proper combustion equipment, including a control system that is capable of adjusting the fuel-air mixture so that little or no CO and soot are produced.
Additional air that is required to complete the combustion process is sometimes provided in stages.
Staged combustion is a NOx control technique based on the fact that combustion at either very low or very high excess air levels results in reduced NOx formation.
By mixing air and fuel at two or more locations inside a boiler, it is possible to create zones with high and low excess air levels.
Air that is injected into a boiler at different points or stages in the combustion process is known as staged combustion air (SCA).
The NOx control techniques based on this concept are described in Sect. 5.2.1.
New boilers and combustion equipment that are well-designed are capable of achieving both high efficiency and low NOx formation.
However, for existing boilers, changes in firing profile may change the absorption profile, temperature profile, and carbon burnout of a boiler, thereby affecting boiler efficiency.
The reaction of hydrogen atoms in fuel with oxygen molecules in air produces heat and water vapor.
When the water vapor leaves the stack, it reduces the available energy by carrying away the associated latent heat of vaporization.
Reducing the temperature of the flue gas as a means of lowering the heat loss is an effective way to conserve energy, but it can lead to serious corrosion problems.
Because natural gas has a relatively high hydrogen content when compared to coal, this form of heat loss is higher for naturalgas-fired boilers than for comparable size coal-fired boilers.
Moisture in fuel represents another form of heat loss.
Like the phenomenon just described, the water vapor leaving the stack reduces the available energy by carrying away the associated latent heat of vaporization.
As water vapor from the fuel is superheated, additional heat loss is experienced.
The wasted energy from this form of heat loss can be significant for solid fuels but tends to be less for gaseous fuels, which usually have a lower moisture content.
Radiant heat loss consists of both radiant and convection heat losses from the outer surfaces of a boiler, which are typically above ambient temperature.
These losses do not vary significantly in magnitude with boiler load because the outer surface temperature of the boiler remains essentially constant while in operation.
However, these losses as a percentage of boiler output get worse whenever the load diminishes.
Two ways to reduce radiant heat loss include adding thermal insulation to outer boiler surfaces and operating the boiler at the lowest temperature consistent with system and boiler manufacturer requirements.
Buildup of soluble salts and accumulation of other solids in the water passages of a boiler can impede heat transfer and eventually restrict flow through boiler passages.
Use of chemicals that impede scaling and regular blowdowns can help control this problem, but the hot water and solid particles that discharge during a blowdown represent wasted energy.
Installing a heat recovery system can reduce 3-18 boiler losses due to blowdowns.
By using chemicals to control scaling, it may be possible to reduce the blowdown rate.
Note that blowdown heat recovery equipment is usually cost-effective only for systems that use continuous rather than intermittent blowdown.
A relatively small but important form of heat loss is characterized as unaccounted losses.
These losses, which are not related to the combustion process, are associated with cyclic rather than continuous boiler operations.
They include prepurge and postpurge losses, natural-draft losses, and off-line shell losses.
Prepurge and postpurge losses involve forcing air through the boiler to remove unburned combustibles before startup and after shutdown.
When this operation is performed, the flowing air removes some thermal energy from the boiler.
Similar to purging losses, natural-draft losses occur when the boiler is shut off and air circulates naturally through the boiler.
Off-line shell losses are radiant heat losses that occur after the boiler is shut off.
Firetube boilers typically have off-line shell losses much less than comparable size watertube boilers because the shell temperature of a firetube boiler is more of a function of the water temperature than the combustion gas temperature.
Heating systems for commercial buildings typically exhibit a wide range of heating demands throughout the heating season.
To minimize unaccounted heat losses associated with cyclic operation, there may be advantages in selecting multiple boilers instead of one or two large boilers.
In this approach, at least some of the smaller units operate more or less continuously.

EMISSIONS STANDARDS AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES Emissions standards for air quality in the United States have been established to address a variety of concerns about atmospheric pollution on the human and natural environment.1 Specific concerns include an increase in ground-level ozone, the accumulation of fine particles in the atmosphere, the development of acid rain, the acidification of aquatic systems, visibility limitations, and releases of HAPs.
Ground-level ozone is created by a chemical reaction between VOCs and oxides of nitrogen.
When these materials react in the presence of sunlight, they form ground-level ozone, a major ingredient of smog.
Fine PM includes dust, smoke, and soot, which typically measure 10 Ã¯Â¿Â½m in diameter or less.
The principal sources of acidic compounds, including acid rain, involve emissions of SO2 and NOx.
The HAPs are of concern because they involve substances that may be carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxins.
4.1
CLEAN AIR ACT In 1970, the CAA established a major role for the federal government in regulating air quality.2 This regulation was further expanded by amendments in 1977 and 1990.
The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) authorize the EPA to establish standards for a number of atmospheric pollutants.3 They also authorize EPA and state agencies to bring civil and criminal actions against violators of the statutes.
The CAA is extremely lengthy and complex.
Compliance with applicable portions of the regulation requires an understanding of the original act that was signed into law in 1970, the various amendments that have since been adopted, changes promulgated by EPA, and numerous rulings issued by the judicial system.
The 1990 CAAA are subdivided into the following seven major titles that address specific air quality and pollution issues.
Title I: Title Title Title Title Title Title Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) II: Provisions Relating to Mobile Sources III: Air Toxics IV: Acid Deposition Control V: Permits VI: Stratospheric Ozone and Global Climate Protection VII: Provisions Relating to Enforcement Requirements in Titles I, III, IV, and V have, or may have in the future, an impact on both new and existing combustion boilers.4 Title I contains requirements for effectively achieving national air quality goals.
Under Sect. 109, EPA is authorized to establish primary and secondary NAAQS.
These standards represent the maximum allowable concentration of a pollutant permitted in the ambient air.
Primary ambient air quality standards define levels of air quality that are considered necessary, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health.
Secondary ambient air quality standards are intended to protect the public welfare from any known or adverse effects of a pollutant.
Both standards are subject to revision, and additional primary and secondary standards may be promulgated, as the EPA Administrator deems necessary to protect the public health and welfare.
Under Sect. 110 of Title I, states are required to adopt plans for implementing, maintaining, and enforcing NAAQS in each air quality control region within its jurisdiction.
Such plans are known as State Implementation Plans (SIPs).
These plans establish emission standards for specific sources.
To achieve compliance, states are subdivided into a number of identifiable areas known as air quality control regions in which at least the minimum NAAQS must be met or control requirements imposed.
If the level 4-1 of a regulated pollutant exceeds the specified federal standard within a particular region, it is classified as a nonattainment area (NAA).
When a region fails to meet a NAAQS, more stringent emission control requirements, designed to reduce emission levels and thereby achieve attainment, must be applied.
As in prior environmental legislation, local or state environmental regulatory agencies may impose stricter regulations on individual sources or areas.
Authorization for EPA to establish performance standards for new stationary sources is provided in Sect. 111 of Title I. These New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) establish maximum emission rates for selected pollutants from new steam generating units and existing units that undergo substantial modifications.
This legislation ensures that standard emissions controls are applied uniformly in all areas, irrespective of ambient air quality considerations.
According to the legislation, the degree of emissions limitation is achieved through the application of the best system of emission reduction, which has been adequately demonstrated.
Title III amended Sect. 112 of the CAA regarding requirements for reducing emissions of toxic air pollutants.
Toxic air pollutants are those pollutants that are hazardous to human health or the environment but are not specifically covered under another portion of the CAA.
The CAA of 1990 includes a comprehensive plan for achieving significant reductions in emission of HAPs from major sources.
Section 112 includes a list of toxic air pollutants for which emissions must be reduced.
Often characterized as carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxins, these pollutants are typically subdivided into the following groups: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ metals, including cadmium, mercury, lead, and PM; organics, including dioxins and furans; and acid gases, including hydrogen chloride, SO2, and NOx.
To establish regulations for these pollutants, EPA developed and published a list of source categories that emit 10 tons/year of any one or 25 tons/year of any combination of those pollutants.
Based on this list, EPA has either issued or is now developing Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for each listed source category.
These standards are based on the best demonstrated control technology or practice within the regulated industry.
Currently, EPA has established MACT standards for certain HAP sources, including large municipal waste combustion units.
Standards for ICI boilers that burn fossil fuels are under development.
From a boiler emissions viewpoint, mercury and hydrogen chloride are the two HAPs that will likely be regulated.
When developing a MACT standard for a particular source category, EPA looks at the level of emissions currently being achieved by the best-performing similar sources through clean processes, control devices, work practices, or other methods.
These emissions levels set a baseline (often referred to as the "MACT floor") for the new standard.
At a minimum, a MACT standard must achieve, throughout the industry, a level of emissions control that is at least equivalent to the MACT floor.
The MACT floor is established differently for existing sources and new sources.
For existing sources, the MACT floor must equal the average emissions limitations currently achieved by the best-performing 12% of sources in that source category, provided there are 30 or more existing sources within the category.
If there are fewer than 30 existing sources, then the MACT floor must equal the average emissions limitation achieved by the best-performing five sources in the category.
For new sources, the MACT floor must equal the level of emissions control currently achieved by the best-controlled similar source.
Wherever feasible, EPA writes the final MACT standard as an emissions limit (i.e., as a percent reduction in emissions or a concentration limit that regulated sources must achieve).
Emissions limits provide flexibility for industry to determine the most effective way to comply with the standard.
Title IV establishes requirements for significantly reducing NOx and SO2 emissions.
To achieve this statutory goal, EPA established the Acid Rain Program.
Its objective is to reduce adverse effects of acid deposition by controlling SO2 and NOx emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants.
Requirements for SO2 emissions are contained in Sect. 403.
This section addresses the SO2 allowance program for new and 4-2 existing units.
Separate requirements for NOx emissions are provided in Sect. 407.
These requirements are part of the EPA's NOx emission reduction program.
Acid Rain Program regulations have been codified in Title 40, Subchapter C of the Code of Federal Regulations
.59 Title V contains legislation covering federal and state air permitting programs that apply to major sources of atmospheric pollution.
Specific definitions of major sources are spelled out in Sects.
112 and 302 of the legislation.
Each permit issued under this title must include enforceable emission limitations and standards, a schedule of compliance, and a requirement that the permit applicant submit the results of required monitoring to the permitting authority
.
Regulations that provide for the establishment of comprehensive state air quality permitting systems consistent with Title V requirements are contained in 40 CFR Part 70 (Ref. 10).
Additional regulations that establish certain general provisions and the operating permit program requirements for affected sources and affected units under the Acid Rain Program are contained in 40 CFR Part 72 (Ref. 5).
Units affected by this regulation are identified in 40 CFR 72.6 and 40 CFR Part 74 (Ref. 6).
4.1.1 National Ambient Air Quality Standards The NAAQS for six criteria pollutants, including ozone (O3), NOx, SO2, CO, PM, and lead have been codified in 40 CFR Part 50 (Ref. 11).
The primary and secondary standards for each of these pollutants except lead are summarized in Table 4.1 and described below.
Standards for lead are not covered in this guide because it is not a major pollutant from combustion boilers that burn fossil fuels.
Principal sources of lead include leaded gasoline (being phased out), paint (houses and cars), smelters (metal refineries), and manufacture of lead-acid storage batteries.
Currently, the only boilers that must comply with lead emission standards are large municipal waste combustion units.12 Areas where the level of a criteria pollutant is above the primary standard are considered NAAs.
The NAAs are subject to more stringent requirements aimed at reducing emissions to achieve attainment.
Attainment areas include areas where the level of a criteria pollutant is below the primary standard.
As the regulation is written, it is possible for a source to be located in an area that is classified as an NAA for one or more pollutants and an attainment area for the others.
Owners and operators of boiler systems that meet criteria established by EPA must obtain a permit from the regulatory authority having jurisdiction before the system can be operated.
The emission controls that must be installed and the conditions under which the system is allowed to operate often vary from one location to another.
This variation is due the local air quality and the degree to which the local atmospheric conditions deviate from the NAAQS.
In general, systems located in attainment areas are allowed to release more pollutants into the atmosphere than systems located in NAAs. 4.1.1.1 Ozone Ozone NAAs are classified according to the severity of each area's air pollution problem.
These classifications are marginal, moderate, serious, severe, and extreme.
Each NAA is assigned to one of these categories, thus triggering varying requirements with which the area must comply to meet the ozone standard.
According to the regulation, NAAs must implement different control measures, depending on their classification.
Marginal areas, for example, are the closest to meeting the standard.
They are required to conduct an inventory of their ozone-causing emissions and institute a permit program.
The NAAs with more serious air quality problems must implement various other control measures.
In general, areas with the worst air quality must implement the most stringent emission controls.

4-4 In 1997, EPA reviewed the air quality standard for ground-level ozone and established the primary and secondary 8-h NAAQS for ozone at 0.08 ppm and the primary and secondary 1-h NAAQS for ozone at 0.12 ppm (Refs. 11 and 13).
4.1.1.2 Nitrogen oxides Many urban areas do not meet the ozone standard and are classified as NAAs.
To address this problem as well as regional pollution transport, more restrictive requirements were established for NOx emissions from electric power generating plants and other large stationary boilers in 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia.
The requirements set statewide NOx emissions budgets, including budget components for the electric power industry and certain industrial sources.
To achieve the required statewide emissions budgets, states are required to develop SIPs that include NOx emission limits for specific sources.
The NOx emissions by source are identified in Table 4.2.
Table 4.2.
Emissions by source of NOx and SO2 in the United States Emissions source Utilities Transportation Industrial/commercial/residential Other Source: http://www.epa.gov NOx (%) 27 49 19 5 SO2 (%) 67 5 21 7 According to regulations in 40 CFR 50.11 (Ref. 11), the primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for NO2 are 0.053 ppm, annual arithmetic mean concentration.
In addition to these standards, Title I of the CAA includes provisions designed to address both the continued nonattainment of the existing ozone NAAQS and the transport of air pollutants across state boundaries.
These provisions allow downwind states to petition for tighter controls on upwind states that contribute to their NAAQS nonattainment status.
In general, Title I NOx provisions require areas with an ozone nonattainment region to (1) require existing major stationary sources to apply RACT; (2) require new or modified major stationary sources to offset their emissions and install controls representing the LAER; and (3) require each state with an ozone nonattainment region to develop a SIP that, in some cases, includes reductions in stationary source NOx emissions beyond those required by the RACT provisions of Title I, if needed to attain the ozone NAAQS.4 RACT is defined as the lowest emission limitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by application of control technology that is reasonably available, considering technological and economic feasibility.
It also represents the minimum requirement that EPA can accept for existing sources in nonattainment state plans.14 LAER is defined as the emissions rate required on major new or modified sources in NAAs.
Section 184 of the CAA delineates a multistate ozone transport region (OTR) in the northeast and requires specific additional NOx and VOC controls for all areas in this region.
It also establishes the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) for the purpose of assessing the degree of ozone transport in the OTR and recommending strategies to mitigate the interstate transport of pollution.
The OTR consists of the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, parts of northern Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
The OTR states confirmed that they would implement RACT on major stationary sources of NOx (Phase I) and agreed to a phased approach for additional controls, beyond RACT, for power plants and other large fuel combustion sources (Phases II and III).
This agreement, known as the OTC 4-5 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for stationary source NOx controls was approved on September 27, 1994.
All OTR states, except Virginia, are signatories to the OTC NOx MOU.4 The MOU establishes an emissions trading system for the various OTR jurisdictions to reduce the costs of compliance with the control requirements under Phase II (which began on May 1, 1999) and Phase III (beginning on May 1, 2003).
The OTC program caps summer season (May 1 through September 30) NOx emissions for all 13 OTR jurisdictions are approximately 219,000 tons in 1999, and 143,000 tons in 2003, which represent approximately 55 and 70% reductions in NOx, respectively, from the 1990 baseline emission level of 490,000 tons.
To address long-range transport of ozone, EPA promulgated a rule on October 27, 1998, known as the NOx SIP call.15 The purpose for this rule is to limit summer season NOx emissions in 22 northeast states and the District of Columbia that EPA considers significant contributors to ozone nonattainment in downwind areas.
These states were required to amend their SIPs through a procedure established in Sect. 110 of the CAA. EPA finalized a summer-season state NOx budget (in tons of NOx) and developed a state implemented and federally enforced NOx trading program to provide for emissions trading by certain electric and industrial stationary sources.
Each affected state's NOx budget is based on the application of a population-wide 0.15-lb/MBtu NOx emission rate for large electricity generating units and a 60% reduction from uncontrolled emissions for large nonelectricity generating units.
This effort is projected to reduce summer-season NOx emissions by 1.1 million tons in the affected 22 states and the District of Columbia.
EPA issued revised budgets for NOx emissions for each of the 23 jurisdictions included in the NOx SIP call on March 2, 2000.16 In addition to promulgating the NOx SIP call, EPA responded to petitions filed by eight northeastern states under Sect. 126 of the CAA.
The petitions, which are known as Section 126 Petitions, request that EPA make a finding that NOx emissions from certain major stationary sources significantly contribute to ozone nonattainment problems in the petitioning states.
The final Sect. 126 rule requires upwind states to take action to reduce emissions of NOx that contribute to nonattainment of ozone standards in downwind states.17,18 The findings affect large electric generating units and both nonelectric generating boilers and turbines located in 12 northeast states and the District of Columbia.
Similar to the NOx SIP call, EPA has finalized a federal NOx Budget Trading Program based on the application of a population-wide 0.15-lb/MBtu NOx emission rate for large electric generating units and a 60% reduction from uncontrolled emissions for large nonelectric generating units.
The final Sect. 126 actions are projected to reduce summer-season NOx emissions by 510,000 tons in the 12 affected states and the District of Columbia.
The compliance deadline was initially set for May 1, 2003 (Ref. 4) but has now been extended to May 31, 2004.
An overview of regulatory actions concerning NOx emissions that affect specific regions of the United States is presented in Table 4.3.
4.1.1.3 Sulfur dioxide Separate primary and secondary NAAQS have been established for SO2 emissions.11 The maximum allowable SO2 emissions levels for each of these categories are presented in Table 4.1.
4.1.1.4 Carbon monoxide The primary NAAQS for CO are Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 9 ppm (10 mg/m3) for an 8-h average concentration not to be exceeded more than once per year, and 35 ppm (40 mg/m3) for a 1-h average concentration not to be exceeded more than once per year.11 There are no secondary NAAQS for CO emissions.

Nationwide July 9, 1997 Annual Areas exceeding the standards for CO are divided into moderate and serious classifications.
Depending on the degree to which they exceed the standard, areas are required to implement programs introducing oxygenated fuels or enhanced emission inspection programs, among other measures.3 4.1.1.5 Particulate matter In 1997, EPA reviewed the air quality standard for PM and revised the NAAQS.11,13 Requirements for PM with an aerodynamic diameter up to 10 Ã¯Â¿Â½m (PM10) were retained, while requirements for PM with an aerodynamic diameter up to 2.5 Ã¯Â¿Â½m (PM2.5) were added.
The maximum allowable primary and secondary NAAQS for PM emissions are presented in Table 4.1.
To attain this standard, the following conditions for both PM10 and PM2.5 must apply.
For PM10: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The arithmetic average of the 24-h samples for a period of 1 year, averaged over 3 consecutive years, must not exceed 50 Ã¯Â¿Â½g/m3.
The 99th percentile of the distribution of the 24-h concentrations for a period of 1 year, averaged over 3 years, must not exceed 150 Ã¯Â¿Â½g/m3 at each monitor within an area.
For PM2.5: The 3-year average of the annual arithmetic mean of the 24-h concentrations from single or multiple population-oriented monitors must not exceed 15 Ã¯Â¿Â½g/m3.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4-7 Ã¯Â¿Â½ The 98th percentile of the distribution of the 24-h concentrations for a period of 1 year, averaged over 3 years, must not exceed 65 Ã¯Â¿Â½g/m3 at each monitor within an area.
Based on their classification, owners and operators of boiler systems located in areas that exceed the PM standard are required to implement either reasonably available control measures (RACM) or best available control measures (BACM), among other requirements.3 4.1.2 Emissions from Existing Steam Generating Units Title IV of the CAA established a goal of reducing SO2 and NOx emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants compared to 1980 levels.
Based on the legislation, a goal was established to reduce annual SO2 emissions by 10 million tons and NOx emissions by 2 million tons by 2000.
To achieve this objective, EPA established the Acid Rain Program, which involved a two-phased strategy for tightening the SO2 and NOx emissions restrictions.
The Acid Rain Program for SO2 emissions represents a dramatic departure from traditional command and control regulatory methods, which establish specific, inflexible emissions limitations with which all affected sources must comply.
Instead, the Acid Rain Program introduces an allowance trading system to reduce pollution.19
Under this system, affected utility units are allocated allowances based on their historic fuel consumption and a specific emissions rate.
Each allowance permits a unit to emit 1 ton of SO2 during or after a specified year.
For each ton of SO2 discharged in a given year, one allowance is retired; that is, it can no longer be used.
Allowances may be bought, sold, or banked.
Any person may acquire allowances and participate in the trading system.
However, regardless of the number of allowances a source holds, it may not emit at levels that would violate federal or state limits
.
To restrict emissions and ensure that environmental benefits are achieved and maintained, a permanent annual ceiling (or cap) of 8.95 million allowances for allocation to utilities has been established for Phase II beginning on January 1, 2000.
The Acid Rain Nitrogen Oxides Reduction Program is also implemented in two phases, beginning in 1996 and 2000.
Although this program is results-oriented, it does not cap NOx emissions as the SO2 program does.
The NOx emissions limits for existing boilers are based on a maximum allowable emission rate expressed in pounds of NOx per million British thermal units of heat input.20 Note that, although there are no federal caps on NOx emissions, three cap-and-trade programs for regional control of NOx emissions have been established.
They include the OTC NOx Budget Program with NOx emission allowances set by OTC, Sect. 126 Federal NOx Budget Trading Program, and the NOx SIP Call Program in which states have options of participating in the trading program and establishing unit allocations.
More information about each of these EPA-administered programs is presented in the NOx part of Sect. 4.1.1.
4.1.2.1 Sulfur dioxide reduction program Phase I of the SO2 reduction program began on January 1, 1995, and extended to December 31, 1999.
During that time, 110 mostly coal-burning electric utility power plants located in 21 midwestern and northeastern states were required to reduce SO2 emissions.
Affected plants and associated units are identified in 40 CFR 73, Subpart B.19 To provide a cost-effective approach for SO2 reductions, each affected unit was issued SO2 emission allowances equal to 2.5 lb/MBtu of heat input multiplied by 40% of the unit's 19851987 fuel consumption.
Each allowance permitted the emission of 1 ton of SO2 in a given year or any year thereafter.
According to the rules, allowances can be bought and sold on the open market, and unused allowances can be sold or banked for future use.
This market-based allowance trading system provided the plant owner the option of either reducing emissions or acquiring additional allowances from other plants to cover the actual emissions.
Methods of reducing emissions included employing energy conservation measures, increasing reliance on renewable energy, reducing usage, 4-8 employing pollution control technologies, switching to lower sulfur fuel, or developing alternate strategies.
In Phase II, which began on January 1, 2000, emission limits imposed on Phase I plants were tightened, and emission limits were also imposed on smaller, cleaner units.19 Allowance allocation calculations are made for various types of units, such as coal-fired and gas-fired units with low and high emissions rates or low fuel consumption.
EPA allocates allowances to each unit at an emission rate of 1.2 lb/MBtu of heat input, multiplied by the unit's baseline.
During Phase II, EPA can issue no more than 8.95 million allowances to units in a given year.
This effectively caps emissions at 8.95 million tons annually and ensures that the mandated emissions reductions are maintained over time.
Additional SO2 emitting sources that did not receive allocations as part of Phase I or Phase II can be issued allowances through the EPA's Opt-in Program.6 This program, which is authorized under Sect. 410 of the CAAA of 1990, expands EPA's Acid Rain Program by providing the opportunity for other participants to enter the program on a voluntary basis, reduce their SO2 emissions, and receive their own acid rain allowances.
EPA has determined that participation of these additional sources can be costeffective.
If a participating source can reduce its SO2 emissions at a relatively low cost, its reduction, in the form of allowances, can be transferred to electric utilities where emission reductions are more expensive.
The Opt-in Program offers a combustion source a financial incentive to voluntarily reduce its SO2 emissions.
By reducing emissions below its allowance allocation, an opt-in source will create unused allowances, which it can sell in the SO2 allowance market.
Opting in is profitable when the revenue from allowances exceeds the combined cost of the emissions reduction and the cost of participating in the Opt-in Program.
Participation in the Opt-in Program requires an opt-in permit based on permitting procedures provided in 40 CFR 74, Subpart B.6 4.1.2.2 Nitrogen oxides reduction program Phase I of the Acid Rain Nitrogen Oxides Reduction Program establishes NOx emission limits for Group 1 boilers.20 These boilers, which included only dry-bottom, wall-fired, and tangentially fired units, are located at plants identified in 40 CFR 73, Subpart B.19 As a result of Phase I activities, NOx emissions declined by more than 400,000 tons/year.
This decline was achieved primarily by the installation of low-NOx burners on these boilers.
Phase I ended on December 31, 1999.
In Phase II, lower emissions limits were set by EPA for certain Group I boilers, and emissions limits were established for Group 2 boilers.
Group 2 boilers include those applying cell-burner technology, cyclone boilers, wet-bottom boilers, and other types of coal-fired boilers.
In establishing these limits, EPA determined that more effective low- NOx burner technology is available to establish more stringent standards for Phase II, Group 1 boilers than those established for Phase I, and it established limits for Group 2 boilers based on NOx control technologies that are comparable in cost to low-NOx burners.
For Group I boilers, annual average emission rates for dry-bottom and wall-fired boilers is set at 0.46-lb/MBtu heat input and 0.40-lb/MBtu heat input for tangentially fired boilers.
Some Group I boilers are not affected by the Phase II rates and will continue to comply with the Phase I annual average emission rates of 0.50 lb/MBtu for dry-bottom and wall-fired and 0.45 lb/MBtu for tangentially fired boilers.
The statute allows for emissions averaging in which the emissions levels established by EPA are applied to an entire group of boilers owned or operated by a single company.
It is estimated that the more stringent Phase II limits will result in an additional NOx reduction of 820,000 tons/year.
The Phase II limits are 0.68 lb/MBtu for cell-burners, 0.86 lb/MBtu for cyclones greater than 155 MW(e), 0.84 lb/MBtu for wet-bottom boilers greater than 65 MW(e), and 0.80 lb/MBtu for vertically fired boilers.
As a result of Phase II activities, NOx emissions are expected to decline by approximately 2.06 million tons/year.
A utility can choose to comply with the rule in one of three ways: (1) meet the standard annual emission limits; (2) average the emissions rates of two or more boilers, which allows utilities to 4-9 over-control at units where it is technically easier and less expensive to control emissions; or (3) if a utility cannot meet the standard emission limit, it can apply for a less stringent alternative emission limit (AEL) if it uses the appropriate NOx emission control technology on which the applicable emission limit is based.
EPA's determination of an AEL is based on evidence that control equipment was properly designed, installed, and operated during a demonstration period.
To employ a more flexible emissions trading approach, an option was devised whereby a state (or group of states) could petition EPA to accept an emissions cap-and-trade program as a substitute for compliance with the Group 2 limits and incremental reductions required of Group 1 boilers as set forth in the final rule 61 FR 67156 (Ref. 21).
Under this option, the EPA administrator retains the authority to provide relief for boilers that are subject to a cap-and-trade program under Title I from emission limits established in the final rule.
The relief is contingent on the EPA administrator finding that alternative compliance through the cap-and-trade program will achieve lower total NOx emissions from the Group 1 and Group 2 boilers in the state (or group of states) than if the new emission limits remained applicable.
Because the CAAA do not permit the administrator to relax existing limits, the existing Group 1 limits, established by the April 13, 1995 regulations, will apply to Group 1 boilers covered by any cap-and-trade program.
This added flexibility is intended to encourage states and utilities involved in the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) region, where approximately 87% of the boilers covered by this rule are located, to become involved in a regional cap-and-trade program for NOx reduction.
This provision allows utilities under a cap-and-trade program to reduce NOx even more cost-effectively than under the current rule.
According to EPA, this trading provision provides for coordination of NOx reduction initiatives under Titles I and IV and is consistent with statutory requirements in a way that promotes the goal of achieving necessary NOx reductions in a cost-effective manner.
General provisions and the applicability, permitting, allowance, excess emissions, monitoring, and opt-in provisions for the NOx Budget Trading Program are provided in 40 CFR 96 and 40 CFR 97 (Refs. 22 and 23).
4.1.3 New Source Performance Standards The EPA has established standards of performance for new stationary emission sources, including steam generating units.
Emission limits in these standards are generally more stringent than emission limits set for existing facilities already in operation.
The NSPS are codified in federal regulations and cover maximum emissions rates and required reductions in potential combustion concentrations for PM, SO2, and NOx (expressed as NO2) emissions.
Potential combustion concentration means the theoretical emissions in pounds per million British thermal units heat input that would result from combustion of fuel in an uncleaned state without emission control systems.
In this context, new source refers to a unit for which construction or modification commenced after a prescribed date.
The EPA has also established strict emission limitations for new large municipal waste combustion units.
In addition to PM, SO2, and NOx emission limits, the standard for these units contains emission requirements for a number of other pollutants that are released into the air when certain types of municipal waste are burned.
4.1.3.1 Performance standards for new steam generating units The NSPS for electric utility steam generating units are provided in 40 CFR 60, Subpart Da (Ref. 24).
Both the maximum emissions rate and the required reduction of potential combustion concentration must be met by affected facilities with electric steam generating units that are capable of burning more than 250-MBtu/h heat input of fossil fuels (either alone or in combination with any other fuel) and for which construction or modification began after September 18, 1978.
For this regulation, an electric utility steam generating unit means any steam electric generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25-MW electrical 4-10 output to any utility power distribution system for sale.
A summary of NSPS for electric utility steam generating units is provided in Appendix A, Table A.1.
Maximum emissions rates and required reduction of potential combustion concentrations are contained in 40 CFR 60, Subpart Db (Ref. 25) for facilities with ICI steam generating units that are capable of combusting more than 100-MBtu/h heat input and for which construction, modification, or reconstruction began after June 19, 1984.
Additional standards are also provided for coal-fired and oil-fired units with heat input capacities between 100 and 250 MBtu/h and certain coal-fired and oil-fired units with heat input capacities greater 250 MBtu/h for which construction, modification, or reconstruction began after June 19, 1984, but on or before June 19, 1986.
Standards for ICI steam generating units that conform to these restrictions are summarized in Appendix A, Table A.2.
The NSPS for small ICI steam generating units that are capable of combusting between 10- and 100-MBtu/h heat input and for which construction, modification, or reconstruction began after June 9, 1989, are provided in 40 CFR 60, Subpart Dc (Ref. 26) and summarized in Appendix A, Table A.3.
Careful review of this table reveals that there are no emission limits for NOx emissions.
So far, EPA has not promulgated NOx emission standards for these small units.
In 1998, EPA promulgated a revised NOx NSPS for new fossil-fuel-fired electric utility and ICI steam generating units.27 The new standards revise the NOx emission limits for steam generating units covered in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Da (Ref. 24) and Subpart Db (Ref. 25) and affect only units for which construction or reconstruction commenced after July 9, 1997.
The NOx emission limit in the final rule for new Subpart Da units is 1.6-lb/MWh gross energy output regardless of fuel type.
This change from an input-based format where emissions are linked to the fuel used to an output-based format is intended to promote energy efficiency and NOx reduction.
An output-based format links the emission limit to the amount of electricity generated rather than to the fuel used for combustion.
For existing sources that become subject to Subpart Da through reconstruction, the NOx emission limit is still expressed in an input-based format of 0.15 lb/MBtu of heat input.24 For new and existing ICI boilers that are subjected to the new source performance standards, EPA lowered the emissions rate to 0.20 lb/MBtu of heat input.25 4.1.3.2 Performance standards for new municipal waste combustion units The EPA has established NSPS for municipal waste combustion units that are capable of burning greater than 250 tons/day of MSW for which construction commenced after September 20, 1994 or for which modification or reconstruction commenced after June 19, 1996 (Ref. 12).
In this standard, MSW means household, commercial, retail, and institutional waste that includes yard waste, RDF, and motor vehicle maintenance materials limited to vehicle batteries and tires.
Emissions that are regulated include Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ PM, cadmium, lead, mercury, SO2, hydrogen chloride, dioxin/furan, and NOx.
The maximum allowable emission rates for each of these pollutants are summarized in Appendix A, Table A.4.
Specific limits for CO emissions have also been established.
However, the maximum allowable CO emission rate varies depending on the technology that is used to burn the municipal waste.
4-11 In addition to emission limitations, the regulation also has a requirement for operator certification.
Each chief facility operator and shift supervisor must obtain and maintain operator certification from either the ASME28 or a state certification program.
At this time, EPA has not established NSPS for new municipal waste combustion units that are capable of burning 250 tons/day of MSW or less.
However, state and local jurisdictions can impose emission limitations on these units provided the requirements are consistent with federal law.
4.1.4 Permitting Requirements Title V of the CAA includes provisions for issuance of operating permits by the federal government (EPA) as well as state and local jurisdictions.
This provision ensures that mandated emissions limitations and emission reduction requirements are achieved in actual practice.
Each permit specifies the enforceable requirements that apply to each affected unit or source.
In this context, a source is any governmental, institutional, commercial, or industrial structure, installation, plant, building, or facility that emits a regulated air pollutant.
Specific definitions of major sources are spelled out in Sects.
112 and 302 of the legislation.
Each permit issued under Title V must include enforceable emission limitations and standards, a schedule of compliance, and a requirement that the permit applicant submit the results of required monitoring to the permitting authority.
Other permitting provisions pertain to the certifying of Designated Representatives for affected sources, schedules for submissions, permit processing and revision procedures, and periodic compliance certification reporting.
Permits are subject to public comment before approval and are generally available to the public after they are issued.
Regulations that provide for the establishment of comprehensive state and local air quality permitting systems consistent with the requirements of Title V are contained in 40 CFR Parts 70 and 71 (Refs. 10 and 29).
Additional regulations that establish certain general provisions and the operating permit program requirements for affected sources and affected units under the Acid Rain Program are contained in 40 CFR Part 72 (Ref. 5).
Units affected by this program are identified in 40 CFR 72.6 and 40 CFR Part 74 (Ref. 6).
The approval status of the various state and local operating permit programs is summarized in 40 CFR 70, Appendix A.
Other requirements that may influence the permitting process are contained in Title I, Sect. 112 of the CAA, 40 CFR 50 (Ref. 11), 40 CFR 51.165 (Ref. 30), 40 CFR 52.21 (Ref. 31), and 40 CFR 60, Subparts Da, Db, Dc, and Eb (Refs. 2426, and 12).
Section 112 of CAA lists nearly 200 compounds as HAPs.
For facilities that emit, or could emit, HAPs above a certain level, one of the following two requirements must be met.
1.
EPA has established standards for specific types of sources.
These MACT standards are based on the best demonstrated control technology or practice found on similar sources.
2.
For sources where a MACT standard has not been established, the level of control technology required is determined on a case-by-case basis.
Performance standards for new sources are provided in 40 CFR 60, Subparts Da, Db, Dc, and Eb (Refs. 2426, and 12).
They apply to new or modified equipment in a particular industry category.
These regulations establish emission limits or work-practice standards for more than 60 categories of sources.
Regulations in 40 CFR 50 (Ref. 11) set maximum permissible levels for six criteria pollutants.
These NAAQS are designed to protect public health and the environment from harmful effects of NOx, SO2, CO, O3, PM, and lead emissions.
Additional discussions about NAAQS are presented in Sect. 4.1.1.
Required emission controls for these pollutants depend on the attainment or nonattainment status of the area where the source is located.
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations in 40 CFR 52.21 (Ref. 31) allow the installation and operation of large new sources and modification of existing sources in areas that meet the 4-12 NAAQS (attainment areas).
To assure that the area will continue to meet NAAQS, applicants for construction permits must demonstrate that the BACT is being applied.
Requirements for BACT determinations are described in Table 4.4.
A permit to construct and operate a new or modified major source anywhere in an area that does not meet NAAQS (NAAs) cannot be issued unless the source is required to comply with the LAER as defined in 40 CFR 51.165 (Ref. 30).
The meaning of LAER is discussed in Table 4.4.
Table 4.4.
BACT and LAER applicability and requirements BACT BACT: Best Available Control Technology Applicability: BACT is applicable to new boilers located in attainment areas.
These areas are in compliance with NAAQS.a Requirements: By law, BACT determinations must consider the economic, environmental, and energy impacts of each installation on a case-by-case basis.
To satisfy this requirement, a permit applicant must identify all air pollution control options available, the feasibility of applying these options, the effectiveness of each option, and why the option proposed in the application represents BACT.
The accepted method for performing these assessments is known as top-down BACT.
Implementing top-down BACT requires an assessment of emission control technologies beginning with the technique that is the most effective.
If this technique is cost-effective and technically feasible, then it must be applied.
However, if the cost is too high or its application is not feasible, the next most effective technique must be assessed until an acceptable technique is identified.
LAER LAER: Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate Applicability: LAER is applicable to new boilers located in NAAs.
These areas are not in compliance with NAAQS.a Requirements: LAER means the more stringent rate of emissions based on the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ The most stringent emissions limitation that is contained in the implementation plan of any state for such class or category of stationary source, unless the owner or operator of the proposed stationary source demonstrates that such limitations are not achievable; or The most stringent emissions limitation that is achieved in practice by such class or category of stationary sources.
This limitation, when applied to a modification, means the LAER for the new or modified emissions units within a stationary source.
Under no conditions does the application of the term permit a proposed new or modified stationary source to emit any pollutant in excess of the amount allowable under an applicable new source standard of performance.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ LAER is the most stringent of all technology-based regulations and is different from BACT.
The cost-effectiveness of applying a particular emission control technique cannot be considered in LAER determinations.
When required, technology equivalent to LAER must be used regardless of the cost.
aConsult 40 CFR 50 for NAAQS details (Ref. 11).
Permits issued to sources located in NAAs are called Nonattainment New Source Review Permits.
To receive one of these permits, emissions offsets must be obtained.
An offset is a method used in the CAA to give companies that own or operate large (major) sources in NAAs flexibility in meeting overall pollution reduction requirements when changing production processes.
These offsets represent reductions in actual emissions from some other source.
This source may be at the same plant or at another plant owned by the applicant or from some other company with a source that is located within the NAA.
In 4-13 actual practice, permit applicants must obtain an offset that is somewhat greater than the amount of pollution they will emit.
This ensures that permit requirements are met and the NAA keeps moving toward attainment.
The permit applicant must also install pollution control equipment to significantly reduce emissions.
Trading offsets are allowed because total pollution levels will continue to decrease using this approach.
4.1.4.1 Acid Rain Program Permits Affected and unaffected steam generating units subject to Acid Rain Program requirements are identified in 40 CFR 72 (Ref. 5).
Units that are part of Phase I or Phase II make up the bulk of the affected units.
Although most emission sources affected by the Acid Rain Program must have an Acid Rain Permit, two types of affected utility units that are not required to be covered by an Acid Rain Permit are small new units burning clean fuels and retired units.
These units are automatically exempted from the requirement to be covered by an Acid Rain Permit.
However, an exemption notice must be submitted to the permitting authority and EPA headquarters.
During Phases I and II of the Acid Rain Program, affected sources are required to apply for two Acid Rain Permits.
They include Acid Rain Permits issued by EPA during Phase I, and either the acid rain portion of an operating permit issued by a state permitting authority during Phase II or the acid rain portion of an operating permit issued by EPA when it is the permitting authority during Phase II.
Requirements for Acid Rain Permits supplement, and in some cases modify, the state permitting requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 70 (Ref. 10).
Owners and operators of each source must select one person to represent them in matters pertaining to the Acid Rain Program.
A second person may be selected to act as an alternate for the first.
These people are known as the Designated Representative and Alternate Designated Representative, respectively.
Both people must be identified in a Certificate of Representation, submitted to EPA headquarters, as having been selected by an agreement binding on the owners and operators of a source.
The Designated Representative is responsible for submitting to EPA and permitting authorities all Acid Rain Program submissions for the source, including allowance transfers, emission monitoring reports, compliance certifications, Excess Emissions Offset Plans, permit applications, and permit revisions.
The Designated Representative must sign and attest to the truth and accuracy of each submission.
Permits are only issued to a source if EPA has received a Certificate of Representation for the designated representative.
The owner or operator of a source may change the Designated Representative at any time by submitting a revised Certificate of Representation to EPA.
Four types of Acid Rain Permit revision procedures are available: permit modifications, fast-track permit modifications, administrative permit amendments, and automatic permit amendments.
1.
Permit modification procedures apply to, among other things, the inclusion of compliance plans in the Acid Rain Permit that were not included when the permit was issued.
Permit modifications involve the same public notice and comment procedures as those involved in the issuance of a permit.
2.
The fast-track modification may be used, at the option of the Designated Representative, for incorporation of new compliance options, as well.
With fast-track modifications, the permit applicant gives notice of the proposed permit modification in a newspaper near the area where the source is located and gives notice to interested parties.
The public has 30 d to comment.
The permit applicant submits its proposed modification to the permitting authority, which has 90 d after the close of the comment period to act on the proposed modification.
3.
The administrative permit amendments procedure applies to simple alterations to an Acid Rain Permit such as corrections of typographical errors and name and address changes.
Administrative amendments are made by the permitting authority without public notice.
4-14 4.
An automatic permit amendment occurs whenever EPA records an emissions allowance transaction in the Allowance Tracking System.
An Acid Rain Permit is deemed to automatically include these amendments.
For units that emit SO2 and become affected units under the Acid Rain Program through participation in the Opt-in Program, an Opt-in Permit is required based on permitting procedures in 40 CFR 74, Subpart B (Ref. 6).
The deadline for submitting Acid Rain Permit applications for all Phase I units was February 15, 1993.
EPA issued permits for these units.
Permit applications for all Phase II units were due to an EPAapproved state or local permitting authority on January 1, 1996.
Acid Rain Permits are effective for a 5-year period.
After this time, the permit must be reissued.
Six months prior to expiration, a complete Acid Rain Permit application must be submitted to the appropriate state or local permitting authority.
A complete Acid Rain Permit application must include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ identification of the affected source, identification of the Phase I or Phase II unit or units for which the permit application is being submitted, a complete compliance plan for the unit in accordance with requirements in 40 CFR 72, Subpart D (Ref. 5), the date the unit commenced or will commence operation and the deadline for monitor certification if the unit is for Phase II and it is a new unit, and certification of familiarity with applicable standard requirements.
Each affected source must have a compliance plan covering each affected unit.
A compliance plan is a written document that describes the actions that will be taken to ensure compliance with the Acid Rain Program.
At a minimum, the plan must indicate that the unit will hold enough allowances to cover its annual SO2 emissions and will be operated in compliance with the applicable NOx emission limitations.
Compliance plans must be properly cross-referenced in the Acid Rain Permit for each source and signed by each Designated Representative.
Multiunit compliance options involving separate sources may have different Designated Representatives.
The plan may also include options for compliance with SO2 and NOx emission limitations.
These options are typically described in either separate SO2 or NOx compliance plans that reflect a particular strategy such as those described in Tables 4.5 and 4.6.
4.1.4.2 State Operating Permit Programs In preparing the CAAA, it was generally recognized that states should be responsible for taking the lead in carrying out the requirements in the law, because pollution control problems often require special understanding of local industries, geography, demographics, and ecosystems.
States are required to develop SIPs that explain how each state will perform its duties under the law.
A SIP is a collection of the regulations that a state will use to clean up polluted areas.
During SIP development, states must involve the public through hearings and opportunities to comment.
EPA must also approve the SIP.
If a SIP is unacceptable, EPA can take over enforcing the CAA in that state.
Nothing in the federal regulations prevents a state from establishing more stringent requirements provided that the requirements are consistent with the federal law.
All states are required to develop and implement an operating permit program that meets minimum federal requirements.
Authorization for the operating permit program is provided in Title V, Sects.
501 to 506 of the CAA.
Regulations for implementing the operating permit requirements were promulgated on July 21, 1992, and are located in 40 CFR Part 70 (Ref. 10).
Permits are required both for the operation of 4-15 Table 4.5.
Compliance options for SO2 emissions SO2 compliance option Description Phase I Substitution Plan A Phase I unit may reassign all or some of its Phase I SO2 emissions reduction requirements to one or more existing units (called substitution units) that would otherwise not be regulated until Phase II.
The Phase I unit remains subject to all Phase I requirements, and the substitution unit becomes a Phase I unit, is allocated allowances, and must meet all Phase I requirements.
Substitution units involved in a Substitution Plan must be under the control of the owner or operator of the Phase I unit.
Phase I Extension Plan By February 22, 1993, a Phase I unit, and any unit that would become affected in Phase I under another compliance option, could have applied for a 2-year extension of its Phase I SO2 limitations.
Extensions were granted to units that would (1) use a qualifying technology that could be shown to remove at least 90% of a unit's SO2 emissions, or (2) reassign emissions reduction obligations to another unit that would use such a technology during Phase I.
A unit receiving such an extension of its Phase I SO2 emissions limitations also obtained a similar extension for its Phase I NOx limitations.
A Phase I extension unit was given extra SO2 emissions allowances to cover the SO2 that it emits beyond its basic Phase I allocation during 1995 and 1996.
A limit of 3.5 million allowances was available to these units.
A Phase I unit may meet its SO2 emissions reduction requirements by reducing electricity generation.
The unit can compensate for planned reduced output by (1) designating one or more Phase II SO2-emitting units (called compensating units) to increase generation, (2) adopting verifiable energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, or (3) designating sulfur-free generators to provide increased generation.
EPA grants allowances to compensating units based on their 1985 SO2 emissions rates and their baselines (i.e., average annual fuel use from 1985 to 1987).
Like a substitution unit, a compensating unit becomes a Phase I unit and must meet all Phase I requirements.
Because both the original and compensating units must hold enough allowances to cover SO2 emissions, allowances may be transferred from the original unit to the compensating units to cover emissions beyond their allocated allowances.
The units in a Reduced Utilization Plan are not required to have a common owner or operator with the original unit.
If reduced utilization is not accounted for by a compensating unit, conservation, improved unit efficiency, or sulfur-free generation, the unit reducing utilization may have to surrender allowances.
Phase II Repowering Extension Phase II units may obtain a 4-year extension of the Phase II emissions reduction deadline if they repower with a qualified repowering technology.
Repowering requires replacement of an existing coal-fired boiler with (1) one of seven technologies listed in the CAA, (2) a derivative of one of those technologies, or (3) a technology determined by EPA and the DOE to control multiple combustion emissions and improve boiler or generation efficiency while significantly reducing waste as compared to technology commonly used in 1990.
Qualified technologies are atmospheric or pressurized FBC, integrated gasification combined cycles, magnetohydrodynamics, direct and indirect coal-fired turbines, and integrated gasification fuel cells.
To obtain a Repowering Extension, a Designated Representative must petition EPA for conditional approval of the technology.
If a unit proceeds with repowering that later proves infeasible, it will not be held liable for failing to repower as long as it acted in good faith.
Phase I Reduced Utilization Plan 4-16 Table 4.6.
Compliance options for NOx emissions NOx compliance option Standard emission limitations Description A utility operator can choose to meet the standard annual emission limitation of 0.50 lb/MBtu of NOx for dry bottom wall-fired boilers, or 0.45 lb/MBtu of NOx for tangentially fired boilers.
The CAA requires EPA by January 1, 1997, to determine whether these limitations should be made more stringent for Phase II and to set limitations for other types of coal-fired utility boilers.
A utility can meet the standard emission limitations by averaging the emissions of two or more boilers with the same owner or operator.
This approach allows utilities to overcontrol at units where it is technically easier or less expensive to control emissions, thereby achieving emissions reductions at lower cost.
When a utility cannot meet the standard emission limit using LNB technology, it can qualify for a less stringent AEL if it uses LNB technology designed to meet that limit.
LNB technology excludes combustion air staging approaches that require new holes located outside any boiler opening that includes a burner (i.e., OFA for wall-fired boilers or separated OFA for tangentially fired boilers).
EPA's determination of an AEL is based on evidence that control equipment was properly designed, installed, and operated during a demonstration period.
Utilities with Group 1 boilers were able to ask for a 15-month extension of the compliance deadline to March 31, 1996.
Utilities demonstrated that LNB technology designed to meet the applicable limitation could not be installed and operated at six units by January 1, 1995, without adverse impacts on the reliability of the utility's dispatch of electricity to its customers.
EPA granted extensions for these units.
A Phase II affected unit with a Group 1 boiler that complies with the appropriate Phase I NOx emission limit by January 1, 1997, will be exempt from any revision of the Group 1 emission limitation for Phase II until 2008.
These units cannot average their emissions until 2000, and then they must average using the applicable Phase II limit (which may be more stringent than the Phase I limit).
By encouraging affected sources to comply early with the Phase I limits, emission reductions are achieved early, and the utilities can ensure themselves of greater certainty in their long-range planning and electric grid system reliability.
Emissions averaging Alternative emission limitations Phase I extensions Early election units (operating permits) and for the construction of new units.
State governments benefit from the operating permit program in several ways: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The operating permit program provides a mechanism that state and local agencies can use to consolidate and administer provisions of the CAA, as well as their own laws.
The program provides all state and local permitting agencies with the authority to sustain their operations using direct permit fees rather than general tax revenues.
Improved industrial compliance with emission standards is expected to help state and local governments meet NAAQS and possibly even avoid additional local emission controls.
State or local permitting authorities administer acid rain permitting programs under both Titles IV and V of the CAA.
States process Acid Rain Permit applications, issue draft Acid Rain Permits for public comment, and submit proposed Acid Rain Permits to EPA for review.
The permitting authorities then issue Acid Rain Permits that are approved.
Each Acid Rain Permit specifies the Title IV requirements that apply to the affected source and is a portion of a larger Title V permit.
4-17 An Acid Rain Permit specifies each unit's allowance allocation and NOx emission limitations (if applicable), and also specifies compliance plan(s) for the affected source.
The following schedule presents due dates for Acid Rain Permit applications.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Initial Acid Rain Permit applications were due by January 1, 1996.
Initial NOx compliance plans were due by January 1, 1998.
Acid Rain Permit applications for new units are due 24 months before the unit commences operation.
Renewal Acid Rain Permit applications and NOx compliance plans are submitted to the permitting authority at the same time as the associated Title V permit renewal applications.
Since 1992, EPA has approved permit programs for all 113 state, territorial, and local permitting authorities in the nation.
EPA is also working with tribal governments to develop tribal permit programs.
In the next few years, EPA expects several tribes to submit program plans for approval.
As of January 1998, state and local permitting authorities received nearly 14,000 applications for operating permits.
This represents more than 60% of the estimated 22,000 sources subject to the program nationwide.
State and local permitting authorities have issued nearly 3,000 Title V operating permits and hundreds of draft permits.
In addition, several thousand companies that would otherwise qualify as major sources have agreed to comply with emission standards by maintaining operations below levels that trigger the need for an operating permit.
4.2 INFORMATION SOURCES Because the CAA is a federal law administered by both EPA and various state and local government agencies, these groups are authoritative sources of information about emission standards and compliance issues.
The EPA headquarters is located at 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.
Ten EPA regional offices and numerous other satellite offices and laboratories are located throughout the United States.
Information for contacting EPA staff is readily available using a computer by accessing the World Wide Web (http://www.epa.gov).
Links at this site can also be used to locate offices of the various state environmental protection agencies.
Although it is possible to interface directly with individual staff members of these agencies, valuable documentation about emission standards and compliance issues is electronically available.
Pertinent information about air pollution issues can be found on the EPA web site as well as web sites maintained by state and local agencies.
The EPA home page includes direct links to various sources of information such as the library system, information centers, clearinghouses, publications, newsletters, test methods, and databases.
One of the most useful links on the home page makes it possible to view text of the CAA, the CAAA, and regulations issued by EPA under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
There is even a page that presents The Plain English Guide to the CAA.32 The EPA Web site also contains a separate area dedicated to air projects and programs.
Pages linked to this site contain information describing EPA's position on its Acid Rain Program.
To facilitate transfer of technical information, EPA has established the Technology Transfer Network (TTN).
This network is a collection of technical World Wide Web sites (http://www.epa.gov/ttn) that contain information about many areas of air pollution science, technology, regulation, measurement, and prevention.
In addition, the TTN serves as a public forum for the exchange of technical information and ideas among participants and EPA staff.33 Some TTN pages may be useful in selecting low-emission boilers and combustion equipment: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Air Toxics Web (ATW) site focuses on EPA's efforts to reduce routing emissions from stationary sources.
The Clean Air Technology Center (CATC) serves as a resource for all areas of emerging and existing air pollution prevention and control technologies and provides public access to data and information 4-18 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ on their use, effectiveness, and cost.
CATC includes the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC).
The ClearingHouse for Inventories and Emission Factors (CHIEF) contains information on emission inventories and emission factors.
It also provides access to tools for estimating emissions of air pollutants and developing air emission inventories.
The Emission Measurement Center (EMC) provides access to emission test methods and testing information for the development and enforcement of national, state, and local emission prevention and control programs.
The New Source Review (NSR) Web site is designed to provide material and information pertaining to NSR permitting.
The OAR Policy and Guidance (OAR P
The Support Center for Regulatory Air Models (SCRAM) is a source of information on atmospheric dispersion (air quality) models that support regulatory programs required by the CAA.
The EPA has also established a series of public information centers where relevant information on regulations can be accessed via the World Wide Web.
The information resources center at Region 7 is particularly useful.
It includes electronically accessible databases dealing with policy and guidance documents for Title V operating permits, NSR topics, and PSD issues.
These databases contain documents issued by EPA's headquarters and regions, and the database management systems allow the user to search the contents of the documents.
Another valuable source of information available from EPA is contained in its national publications catalog.34 This hardcopy volume describes the numbering system identification codes used by EPA to designate publications and includes a complete list of EPA publications in numerical order.
General information about EPA and its regions is also provided.
World Wide Web sites for the various state and local government environmental protection organizations, such as California's Environmental Protection Agency, the Air Resources Board (http://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm) and Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, Air Quality Division (http://www.deq.state.mi.us/aqd), also contain useful information.
By using this method of accessing information, it is possible to view pages that address state regulations, establish the basis for air quality programs, present permit application guidance, provide draft permits for public review and comment, and include completed permits issued for construction or operation.
Review of these permits can sometimes be helpful in selecting emission control equipment that will reduce emissions to levels that are acceptable to the permitting authority.
In 1967, an interstate association of air quality divisions was formed to exchange technical information and to promote cooperation and coordination of air pollution control issues.
This association, known as the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), includes the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.
To accomplish its objectives, NESCAUM sponsors air quality training programs, participates in national debates, and promotes a variety of research initiatives.
Their World Wide Web site (http://www.nescaum.org) provides information about their activities and includes a list of their publications.
One document in this list that may be particularly useful is titled NESCAUM BACT Guideline.35 Although published in 1991, this document (http://www.nescaum.org/archive.html) focuses on the types of data required in a preconstruction permitting application and how the data should be used in determining BACT. 4.3 PERMITTING BASICS The permit program established under Title V of the CAA provides a means for federal, state, tribal, and local authorities to regulate air pollution by consolidating all air pollution control requirements into a 4-19 single, comprehensive operating permit that covers all aspects of a source's year-to-year air pollution activities.
For the past several years, EPA has worked with state and local governments to establish operating permit programs in every state, including 60 local programs, as well as programs in the District of Columbia and other territories.
Operating permits are comprehensive regulatory documents used to ensure that source operators know what air pollution control requirements apply.
Although the general procedure for obtaining construction and operating permits is now wellestablished, obtaining a permit is often time-consuming and technically complex.
Extensive knowledge of the boiler and emission control equipment; an understanding of applicable local, state, and federal laws; and a willingness to work with permitting authorities are essential.
More than 100 state and local permitting authorities, including EPA, are involved in issuing permits.
They each have their own set of steps required for the permitting process.
Because of this complexity, only general guidance for obtaining a permit can be provided.
Table 4.7 presents some of the more important steps involved in obtaining permits for new air pollution sources.36,37 The first step in any permitting process involves determining whether a permit is required.
If a permit is required, it is then important to identify the type of permit that is appropriate.
This determination may require a significant level of time and effort by the owner or operator and may involve discussions with legal council, environmental consultants, and regulatory authorities.
In general, all major stationary sources (primarily industrial facilities and large commercial operations) that emit certain air pollutants are required to obtain operating permits.
Whether a source meets the definition of major depends on the type and amount of air pollutants that it emits and, to some Table 4.7.
General guidance for obtaining a permit for a new air pollution sourcea Permitting activity During the initial planning stages of a new installation or emissions source Description Assemble background information, collect resources, and review applicable local, state, and federal air-quality laws and regulations with particular emphasis on the following: CAA and CAAA Ã¯Â¿Â½ Title I--Air Pollution Prevention and Control Ã¯Â¿Â½ Title III--Air Toxics Ã¯Â¿Â½ Title IV--Acid Deposition and Control Ã¯Â¿Â½ Title V--Permits 40 CFR Subpart C Part 50--National Primary and Secondary Ambient Air Quality Standards Part 51, Paragraph 51.165--Permit Requirements Part 52, Paragraph 52.21--Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality Part 60--Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources Part 61--National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Part 63--National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories Part 70--State Operating Permit Programs Part 71--Federal Operating Permit Programs Part 72--Permits Regulation Part 73-- Sulfur Dioxide Allowance System Part 74-- Sulfur Dioxide Opt-Ins Part 75--Continuous Emissions Monitoring Part 76--Acid Rain Nitrogen Oxides Emission Reduction Program Part 96-- NOx Budget Trading Program for State Implementation Plans Part 97--Federal NOx Budget Trading Program Determine whether the installation or source is located in a nonattainment region.
If so, identify which of the six criteria pollutants do not meet NAAQS.
4-20 Table 4.7.
(continued) Permitting activity During engineering design Description Contact the regulatory authority having jurisdiction to discuss the proposed source and whether a permit is required.
If a permit is required, discuss permitting, permit fees, permit-processing time, application forms, air-monitoring requirements, emissions-testing requirements, proposed regulations, emissions requirements, permit limitations, and any other details unique to the proposed installation.
To provide design flexibility, discuss technical options and operating alternatives for emissions control.
Consideration of these options and alternatives may be required as part of the BACT or LAER assessment process.
Complete the required applications for a Permit to Install and finalize any necessary supporting documentation.
Before submitting the application, contact the regulatory authority having jurisdiction and confirm that the data that you plan to submit are sufficient.
Verify that the Designated Authority has signed the application, and then submit the application and supporting documentation.

The central office performs a technical review.
If approved, the central office issues a draft or final Permit to Install.
If not approved, the application is sent back to the local office.
For large sources and certain types of sources, the local or regional office will issue a draft permit and place a notice in the local newspaper detailing the proposed installation and soliciting public comment within 30 days.
A public meeting may be held.
If no comments are received, the process proceeds.
Otherwise, the permit may require modification or be denied.

The owner or operator must comply with the terms and conditions in the permit, which may involve emission reporting.
If operations change, the permit may need to be revised.
Public notification is required when permits are significantly revised.
Contact the regulatory authority having jurisdiction, and begin the process of renewing the operating permit.

degree, on the overall air quality in the vicinity.
Generally, major sources include those stationary facilities that emit 100 tons or more per year of a regulated air pollutant.
Regulated pollutants include compounds such as CO, PM, VOCs, SO2, and NOx.
Smaller sources are considered major in areas that are 4-21 not meeting the national air quality standards for a particular pollutant.
For example, certain sources releasing 25 or even 10 tons of pollutant emissions per year are considered major in areas with extreme ozone problems.
The operating permit program also covers a variety of other significant operations: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ large coal-burning utility boilers and industrial boilers subject to control requirements under the acid rain provisions of the CAA, sources that are subject to requirements under NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs), sources of toxic air pollutants (i.e., any source that emits more than 10 tons/year of an individual toxic air pollutant or more than 25 tons/year of any combination of toxic air pollutants), and sources required to have preconstruction or new source permits under NSR or PSD requirements.
In this context, a source is often a very large facility with a wide variety of processing operations and hundreds of individual emission sources, including combustion boilers.
Examples include chemical plants, petroleum refineries, and large manufacturing facilities.
In cases where multiple emissions sources are involved, the permitting process can be technically complicated.
After the need for a permit has been established, it is generally recognized that many factors can impact a permit application.
Some of the more important factors that may be applicable include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ capacity of a new boiler, including its design features, fuel consumption, and emission control equipment; type and extent of modifications to existing boiler or combustion equipment; time of year and length of time boiler is in operation; methods used to control the boiler and emission control equipment during startup, shutdown, and continuous operation; anticipated changes in equipment or operations during the permit period; maintenance procedures and schedules; location of boiler (Is it in an attainment or nonattainment region?); type and amount of each regulated pollutant emitted; emissions rates from other sources at the site or in the vicinity; terms and conditions of permits previously issued to the owner or operator; terms and conditions of permits previously issued to other emission sources by the same permitting authority; data and supporting documentation required by the permitting authority; environmental impact requirements, including concerns of affected Federal Land Managers; applicability of NSPS and PSD requirements; Continuous Emissions Monitoring (CEM) requirements; BACT assessments; LAER determinations; and emission offsets, allowances, and credits.
Other key provisions of the operating permit program are as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sources are required to provide emissions reports to their permitting authorities at least semiannually and must certify their compliance status annually.
Sources must periodically renew their operating permit, generally every 5 years.
To fund their programs, permitting authorities are required to collect permit fees from sources subject to the operating permit program.
Fees are most frequently based on the amount of air pollutants that a source may emit. 4-22 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Public notification and opportunity for comment must be provided during the permit review process for every new permit and when permits are renewed or significantly revised.
EPA is responsible for overseeing the implementation of permit programs and may object to a permit that fails to comply with program requirements.
EPA is also required to establish a federal permit program in any area where the permitting authority fails to develop and maintain an adequate program of its own.
Note that state and local governments can and do implement separate requirements that are appropriate for their unique local conditions and system of laws.
However, these requirements can be more stringent than those of the federal government.
Although permitting programs are administered by separate governmental agencies, the permitting process reduces the waste and confusion inherent in redundant and contradictory requirements issued by state, local, and federal authorities.
As established, the operating permit program can make it easier to incorporate flexible approaches to operations and to foster use of market-based emissions trading programs as a compliance tool.
This reduces the burden of time-consuming permit amendments for facilities needing to make changes quickly or wishing to make emissions allowance trades.36 The operating permit program provides a uniform and efficient mechanism that state and local agencies can use to consolidate and administer provisions of the CAA as well as their own laws.
4.4 LESSONS LEARNED More than 15,000 permit applications for major sources have been submitted to local, state, and federal permitting authorities to comply with application laws and regulations.38 Through this process, it is apparent to owners, operators, and regulators that the best time to control pollution is at the time the source is installed or modified.
This means that new units should use the best emissions control technology that is available, and modifications to existing units should result in reduced emissions to achieve NAAQS mandated by the CAA.
For successful permitting, it is important to follows these guidelines: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Visit the permitting authority at an early stage in the planning process to identify contacts and establish lines of communications.
Determine what permits are required and which forms must be completed by talking to the regulatory authority.
Cooperate with permitting authorities.
Cooperation is the key to a permitting process that meets all requirements and satisfies the needs of owners, operators, regulators, and the public.
Know the project details and technical plans so that visits to the permitting authority are as productive as possible.
Do not hide design details.
Keep discussions with regulators technical in nature.
Do not let personalities interfere with negotiations.
Anticipate emissions as accurately as possible and then request emission levels that include a margin of safety.
Know when and how to ask for help interpreting laws and regulations that appear to be confusing or conflicting.
Be honest, accurate, and complete when asking questions, submitting applications, and reporting emissions data to regulatory authorities.
Recognize that local and state regulatory authorities may be understaffed for the existing workload and that obtaining a permit may be a long, tedious, and iterative technical process.
Review permits previously issued by the regulatory authority for other facilities with similar design and emission requirements.
Understanding the terms and conditions of these permits and being aware of the basis on which permitting decisions were made can help in the development of a permitting strategy that will be successful.
4-23 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Perform realistic cost estimates, and conduct meaningful cost-benefit analyses.
Involve attorneys in technical discussions with the regulatory authority only when necessary.
Their presence may hinder or impede the exchange of communication about technical issues.
Recognize that the permitting authority has wide interpretive latitude.
Present feasible, technical options for reducing emissions when proposed plans are unacceptable.
Track the permitting process.
Do not turn the permitting process over to a third party and then assume negotiations will proceed smoothly and without delay.
Establish clear exits from a project when it is apparent that the permitting process will not be successful.
Formulate a plan with the regulatory authorities, and stay focused on achieving the required milestones.
Be open and objective with regulators and the public.
Do not withhold information or be confrontational.
Understand the position of the regulatory authority, and only focus on issues that pertain to the permitting process.
Negotiate permit terms and conditions.
Reserve appeals for situations that are considered totally unacceptable or unrealistic.
Persevere, but do not allow time to pass without action.
Time wasted due to delays is usually not recovered.
The permitting process can provide benefits to owners and operators by resolving questions about which local, state, and federal requirements do and do not apply.
It can also enable owners and operators to fully understand their compliance obligations and assure that the permit covers all legal requirements contained in the CAA.
Compliance with emission standards is expected to help state and local governments meet NAAQS and possibly even avoid additional local emission controls.

EMISSION CONTROL TECHNIQUES Controlling NOx, SO2, CO, and PM emissions from ICI boilers is often necessary to comply with environmental regulations.
Techniques that are effective in reducing or eliminating these emissions can be subdivided into three general categories depending on which stage in the combustion process they are applied.
The categories include precombustion, combustion, and postcombustion emission control techniques.
When coal is washed or crude oil is refined, sulfur-laden particles and ash-bearing materials are removed, thereby making the fuel more desirable for applications where lower emissions are required.
These fuel processing methods are very effective precombustion emission control techniques.
Controlling the amount of NOx and SO2 that form during combustion is also an effective technique for reducing emissions.
Although fuel processing and combustion controls play significant roles in emissions reduction, sometimes it is necessary to use postcombustion emission control techniques to remove NOx, SO2, and PM from the flue gas.
Commonly used techniques for processing fuel, controlling the combustion process, and treating flue gas are described in the following sections.
5.1 PRECOMBUSTION Fuel selection is one of the most important factors in minimizing atmospheric emissions.
The type and amount of emissions that must be controlled are directly related to the fuel that is burned.
For example, natural gas is a very clean-burning fuel that is essentially free from sulfur, noncombustible gases, and solid residue.
It is often used in areas where emission standards are the most stringent because there are essentially no SO2 or PM emissions associated with natural gas combustion.
Distillate and residual oils are also good fuel choices although their combustion typically produces some NOx, SO2, and PM emissions.
Depending on the grade, residual oils generally have higher nitrogen, sulfur, and ash contents than distillate oils.
From an emissions viewpoint, coal is the least desirable of all the fossil fuels because it can contain significant amounts of nitrogen, sulfur, and ash.
Nonfossil fuels such as biomass, RDF, and paper mill sludge are somewhat cleaner burning fuels that typically have low-sulfur but highash contents.
For some types of fuel, it is possible to limit the amount of emissions that are released when the fuel is burned by employing precombustion emission control techniques.
Two commonly used techniques involve fuel switching and beneficiation, or preparation.
Both of these techniques are summarized in Table 5.1 and discussed below.
When feasible, fuel switching is a relatively easy emission control technique to apply.
It can be as simple as replacing fuel that produces a certain level of emissions with a different fuel that produces less emissions.
For example, when natural gas is used instead of fuel oil or coal, the need to remove PM and SO2 from the flue gas is eliminated, and the amount of NOx discharged into the atmosphere can be substantially reduced.
When combustion of an alternative fuel results in reduced emissions, fuel switching is viewed as an effective emissions control technique.
Although fuel switching can reduce emissions, it is not always feasible.
When an adequate supply of the alternative fuel is not readily available, when boiler operations and efficiency are adversely affected, or when the cost of alternative fuel is prohibitive, fuel switching is typically not a viable option.
Beneficiation improves fuel quality by the use of mechanical, chemical, or other means of cleaning.1 This technique is most often used to remove sulfur-bearing and ash-bearing materials from coal.
For certain types of coal, beneficiation can reduce the sulfur content by up to 50% with a corresponding reduction in SO2 emissions.
Coal cleaning and preparation require specialized equipment to achieve the desired results.
Design of this equipment takes advantage of the difference in specific gravity among the various coal constituents.
For example, sulfur-bearing and ash-bearing materials such as shale, clay, and pyrite have higher densities than coal.
Some of the methods used to remove these materials from coal 5-1 Table 5.1.
Techniques for controlling emissions before combustion Emission NOx Control technique Switch to fuel with a lownitrogen content Description Removing nitrogen from fuel prior to combustion is generally not practical, but switching to fuel with a low-nitrogen content is an effective technique for reducing NOx emissions.
The level of nitrogen in natural gas is generally low, and fuel oil typically has a lower nitrogen content than coal.
Switching from high- to low-sulfur fuel is an effective technique for reducing SO2 emissions.
Cleaning solid fuel such as coal by mechanical, chemical, or other means is an effective technique for maximizing the quality of the fuel.
Eliminating noncombustible sulfur-bearing materials like pyrites and sulfates prior to combustion can reduce SO2 emissions.
Refining petroleum to produce distillate oil is an effective processing technique that decreases the sulfur content of the fuel.
Removing sulfurbearing compounds prior to combustion is an effective technique for reducing SO2 emissions.
Processing natural gas by removing hydrogen sulfide eliminates the possibility of SO2 emissions during combustion.
Switching from solid fuel such as coal, which has a high-ash content, to oil or natural gas is an effective technique for reducing PM emissions.
Cleaning solid fuel such as coal by mechanical, chemical, or other means is an effective technique for maximizing the quality of the fuel.
Eliminating noncombustible, ash-producing materials like metals, sand, glass, and rock prior to combustion can be a very effective technique for reducing PM emissions.
Refining petroleum into distillate oil is an effective processing technique that decreases the ash content of the fuel.
Removing ash prior to combustion is an effective technique for reducing PM emissions.
SO2 Switch to fuel with a lowsulfur content Perform beneficiation PM Switch to fuel with a lowash content Perform beneficiation involve gravity concentration, flotation, dry processing, and dewatering.2 Removing nitrogen from coal prior to combustion is a good way to reduce NOx emissions, but it is generally not practical.
Another form of fuel beneficiation involves the processing of petroleum and natural gas after they are removed from the earth.
In a refinery, petroleum is subjected to processing operations that produce a number of petroleum-based products, including distillate and residual oils.
As discussed in Sect. 3.1.2, fuel oils are classified into five grades depending on their chemical composition and physical characteristics, including ash and sulfur contents.
From an emissions viewpoint, distillate oils have less SO 2 and PM emissions potential compared to residual oils.
Natural gas that contains sulfur-bearing alcohols and phenols (mercaptans) and a high percentage of hydrogen sulfide are generally processed to remove the undesirable constituents.
This processing converts sour gas to sweet gas, a more desirable fuel with a reduced potential for SO2 emissions.
5.2 COMBUSTION During combustion, nitrogen and sulfur that are present in certain types of fuel oxidize to form NOx and SO2, respectively.
In addition, PM consisting of unburned carbon and ash disperse throughout the flue gas.
Selecting a technique that will effectively control emissions of these materials depends on factors such as the composition of the fuel, the design of the boiler, and the method of firing.
Combustion control techniques that are effective in reducing NOx and SO2 emissions are summarized in Table 5.2 5-2 Table 5.2.
Techniques for controlling emissions during combustion Emission NOx Control technique Operational modifications Ã¯Â¿Â½ oxygen trim (OT) Ã¯Â¿Â½ burner tuning (BT) Ã¯Â¿Â½ low excess air (LEA) Staged combustion air (SCA) Ã¯Â¿Â½ burners out of service (BOOS) Ã¯Â¿Â½ biased firing (BF) Ã¯Â¿Â½ overfire air (OFA) Description Minimizing the amount of excess oxygen supplied to the boiler can reduce thermal NOx formation.
OT, BT, and LEA can sometimes be used to successfully optimize the operation of burners by minimizing excess air without excessively increasing unburned fuel.
Staging the amount of combustion air that is introduced into the burner zone can reduce the flame temperature and thereby reduce thermal NOx formation.
For multiburner units, taking certain BOOS can be an effective technique for staging combustion.
Biasing the fuel flow to different burners can also be an effective technique.
Injecting air into the boiler above the top burner level through OFA ports can decrease the primary flame zone oxygen level and produce an airrich secondary zone where combustion is completed.
Quenching the combustion process with WI or SI can lower the peak flame temperature and result in reduced thermal NOx production.
Recirculating a portion of the flue gas to the combustion zone can lower the peak flame temperature and result in reduced thermal NOx production.
Reducing the air preheat temperature when preheat is used can lower the peak flame temperature and result in reduced thermal NOx production.
Using LNBs can reduce NOx formation through careful control of the fuel-air mixture during combustion.
Control techniques used in LNBs include
