1998 ACO #526 STATE OF MICHIGAN WORKERS' COMPENSATION APPELLATE COMMISSION VICTORIA E. WENDLING, PLAINTIFF, V GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION, SELF INSURED, DEFENDANT.
APPEAL FROM MAGISTRATE JOHNSON.
TIMOTHY S. BURNS FOR PLAINTIFF, SCOTT C. STRATTARD FOR DEFENDANT.
OPINION MILLER, CHAIRPERSON This cause came before the Appellate Commission on appeal by defendant from the decision of Magistrate Cynthia R. Johnson, mailed June 3, 1997, granting plaintiff an open award of benefits for disability arising out of a right knee condition.
Plaintiff was employed at defendant as a production worker.
She began work in 1973 as a broach operator, a job requiring her to process "a couple of thousand parts" per day.
In November of 1974 she tripped on the stairs in her apartment, injuring her right knee.
At work, her knee began to ache; the discomfort intensified; she noticed "besides the pain and swelling that it started to give out.
And sometimes it would like catch."1 Plaintiff consulted Dr. Ben Mayne, who diagnosed a torn cartilage and surgically repaired it on May 9, 1974.2 After a 3 month period of convalescence, she returned to work, "pounding in brass connectors into the steering pump," a "stand up job."
She described her knee as "fair" even though it "started aching again and swelling."
She was able to work until she was laid off, in December of 1974.
Plaintiff was called back to work in August of 1975, "in Plant 6 on the housing line;" "a fast line.
It cycled like every five seconds, six seconds."
She would have to twist 180 degrees to grab DOCKET #97-0483 1 Hearing transcript, p 13.

2 the part, "twist back and put it on the line."3 Plaintiff was assigned to other jobs, all in production, and usually requiring her to stand.
Her knee became progressively worse.
Dr. Mayne performed a second surgery on May 22, 1981.4 After surgery, her knee felt better, and she was assigned to production work again, requiring her to be on her feet "about 70 percent" of the time.
She performed several other production jobs, each requiring her to stand; her knee got progressively worse.
Dr. Mayne again performed athroscopic surgery on July 8, 1991, for the first time noting "early medial compartment osteoarthritis, right knee."5 In February, 1987 she picked up her youngest son at home and "just felt a pop in the right knee."
She had a fourth knee surgery on September 20, 1993,6 went back to work doing the "wire wrap job," and did that job until Dr. James R. Wier performed a right total knee arthroplasty (knee replacement) on May 24, 1994.7 She has not worked since.
Plaintiff filed her Application for Mediation or Hearing on July 7, 1995, and, after hearing, concluded on April 30, 1997, the magistrate found: After reviewing all of the evidence presented, I find that the plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of evidence that she sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of her employment on May 23, 1994.
This is an injury to her right knee but is not a specific injury.
Rather, this is an injury caused by an accumulation of the standing that the plaintiff has done on metal grates and cement floors since 1974 when she had the original open reduction surgery of the right knee.
I found the plaintiff's testimony persuasive.
There is no question that the original cause of her problem was the injury at home when she caught her foot on the stairs.
However, after the original surgery in 1974, the plaintiff returned to work without any restrictions.
All of her work at General Motors involved standing on cement floors or metal grates.
Although some rubber mats were occasionally provided, these rubber mats were not a cushioned rubber mat and basically provided no relief for the plaintiff's right knee.
The plaintiff also had an at-home injury in 1987.
This did not result in any surgery but certainly probably contributed to the plaintiff's right knee deterioration.
However, she continued to work after that without any restrictions.
Even after her fourth surgery in 1993, the plaintiff returned to work at General Motors in a job requiring her to stand at least 80% of the time.
The only restriction 3 Id., p 20.
4 Dr. Weir's deposition, Deposition Exhibit # 4.
Id., Deposition Exhibit # 5.
5 6 Id., Deposition Exhibit # 6.
Id., Deposition Exhibit # 2.
Dr. Weir's postoperative diagnosis was "severe osteoarthritis right knee."
7 2 was in no stair climbing.
Although this restriction was occasionally honored, the plaintiff could not always use the bathroom in another building.
Therefore, to use the bathroom and the cafeteria, she was still required to climb stairs.
She testified that climbing the stairs created difficulty and was painful.
The continued pain and swelling eventually led to the total knee replacement on May 24, 1994.
My opinion is also based upon the medical testimony of Dr. James Weir and Dr. Eric Borofsky.
Dr. Weir opined that standing on a cement floor affects the amount of pressure at the weight bearing surface of the joint.
He testified that standing on the metal grates and the cement floors increased the pressure on the joint surfaces.
This increased pressure led to arthritic changes in the knee joint which eventually resulted in a total knee replacement.
Dr. Borofsky testified that he was not able to determine the cause of the arthritis.
However, he also testified that once a tear exists activities can aggravate the condition.
He further testified that some type of pathological damage is taking place inside the knee when an individual arrives home with swelling and synovitis but began the day at work feeling good.
In my opinion, the testimony of these two doctors, along with the plaintiff's testimony, supports the finding of a work-related injury.
[Emphasis supplied.]
I also find that the plaintiff continues to be disabled.
Both Dr. Borofsky and Dr. Weir placed restrictions on this individual.
Essentially the plaintiff needs a sit/stand option job.
Dr. Borofsky testified that she should do no standing for greater than one hour at a time.
These restrictions are not only because of the plaintiff's total knee replacement but also to lengthen the life span of that knee replacement.
Because of these restrictions, in my opinion, the plaintiff can do none of the previous jobs that she did at General Motors.
Although Mr. Cruz testified that in July of 1996 the plaintiff was allowed to use a stool to do an off-line job, Ms. Wendling testified that she was unable to use the stool because it is too tall.
Because of the knee replacement she had difficulty getting up on to the stool.
Therefore, I find that the plaintiff has an ongoing disability because of the total knee replacement.
Although the plaintiff had previously done some work in a doctor's office, she has not done this work for many years.
In addition, these types of jobs have never been provided to her since her knee replacement.
Therefore, I find that she is entitled to ongoing weekly benefits at the rate as set forth on the Order.
The plaintiff has received Sickness 
The defendant is entitled to coordination under Section 354.
On appeal, defendant argues that "it is simply inescapable that such arthritis is indeed an aging process condition" and the magistrate failed to apply the significant relationship requirement of MCL 3 418.301(2).
Furthermore, plaintiff did not prove a significant work relationship by a preponderance of the evidence.
Ã¯Â¿Â½301(2) states in pertinent part: Mental disabilities and conditions of the aging process, including but not limited to heart and cardiovascular conditions, shall be compensable if contributed to, aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner.
In support of its arguments, defendant points to the record and testimony of Dr. James R. Weir, board-certified orthopedic surgeon and plaintiff's treating physician.
Defendant argues that plaintiff's condition could have been due to non-work-related factors; her weight (5' 4Ã¯Â¿Â½" tall and 220 pounds)8 her age,9 waterskiing,10 her tripping on the stairs in her apartment,11 and picking up her son.12 The magistrate, asserts defendant, should have weighed these factors against those present at work, to determine whether her age-related arthritic knee condition was significantly caused, contributed to, aggravated or accelerated by her employment.
Generally, there is support for defendant's position.
"The relation of osteoarthritis to aging is striking.
When only individuals with severe degrees of osteoarthritis are considered, the increase with age is exponential."
"The incidence of osteoarthritis increases from four per 100 among persons 18 to 24 years of age to 85 per 100 at age 76 to 79 years; 23 percent had moderate or severe disease."13 Evidence in workers' compensation cases often leads to a finding that osteoarthritis (unlike rheumatoid arthritis) is a condition of the aging process; Seldon v Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART), 1996 ACO #562; Koklanaris v UAW Family Education Center, 1995 ACO #116; Spiece v General Motors Corp, 1994 ACO #27; Bladzik v Century Boat Co, 1993 ACO #201; Fatseas v Chrysler Corp, 1993 WCABO #4; Dunn v Hackett Const Co, 1992 ACO #491; Swearngin v H J Heinz Corp, 1991 ACO #76; Vierke v Nagel Paper

"Internal derangement such as a torn fibrocartilage, foreign bodies, as well as irregularities of the articular cartilage, cause repeated injuries sufficient to being about degenerative changes in the cartilage."14 "Blunt, penetrating or repeated trauma, or forced inappropriate motion of a joint or ligament can result in direct traumatic injuries and complications that predispose the individual to the development of traumatic arthritis.
Traumatic arthritis caused by repeated microtrauma sometimes occurs in individuals involved in occupations that require repetitive exercise of a specific joint."15 Defendant's argument that plaintiff did not prove a work relationship by a preponderance of the evidence asks us to examine the record de novo.
To do so would exceed our limited standard of review.
We are not to search the record for support for findings that could have been made by the magistrate.
We may only determine whether the findings actually made enjoy the requisite support for our affirmance; MCL 418.861a(3); Pitts v General Motors Corp, 1989 ACO #189.
The magistrate found a May 23, 1994 work-related injury based on plaintiff's testimony as supported by the testimony of Drs. Weir and Borofsky.
Deferring to the magistrate's judgment on the issue of credibility, Holden v Ford Motor Co, 439 Mich 257, 286 (1992), and seeing no unreasonable basis for the magistrate's choice of experts (or her interpretation of their testimony), Goff v Bil-Mar Foods (After Remand), 454 Mich 507, 527 (1997), we affirm her finding on that issue.
Implicit in the magistrate's decision is a finding that she selected, not an age-related basis for plaintiff's debilitating arthritis [which would require an analysis under Ã¯Â¿Â½301(2)], but a work-related, repeated-microtrauma basis (which requires only a finding that plaintiff's pre-existing knee condition was aggravated at work).
While there is competent, material and substantial evidence on the record to support either selection,16 when we apply the appropriate deference to the magistrate's determination of plaintiff's credibility and selection of reasonable expert testimony, we need go no further in our review and are bound to affirm her decision; Holden v Ford Motor Co (After Remand, On Second Remand), 226 Mich App 138, 144 (1997).
Affirmed.
