Solid Waste Plan Working Group DRAFT Market Development Subcommittee Report Â· Market Development Defined Market Development Â­ the committee sought to define "Market Development" in the framework of Solid Waste Management.
It was agreed that in this context, Market Development would be considered activities that provided or stimulated the demand for materials diverted from the waste stream or the utilization of material(s) that would have otherwise been disposed of as solid waste.
The U.S. EPA Jobs Through Recycling (JTR) Website defines recycling market development as "... fostering businesses that manufacture and market recycled-content products and strengthening consumer demand for those products."1 Â· Economic Considerations 
The impact of national and global economic conditions and their ancillary impact on markets for the subcommittee, and China's role as a primary market for fiber and steel explored recovered materials were recognized.
An April Wall Street Journal Article identified that China is currently the largest market for U.S. Scrap exports, accounting for 23% or $1.2 billion in 2002.
According to the RI Export Assistance Center, scrap and waste was Rhode Island's second largest export category in 2002, for a total value of $144,787,758.
Two market segments were singled out for discussion by the subcommittee.
! Fiber Market The international nature of fiber markets was evidenced by factors such as the detrimental effect that the SARS epidemic had on the fiber market and United Paper Stock's ability to market its product.
The subcommittee agreed that fundamental to all market development efforts was a strong global economy, and that this would create demand for secondary fiber and other materials.
Currently more than 80% of all paper mills in the U.S. use recovered paper to make their products, and nearly 200 mills use exclusively recovered paper.
The American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA) has set a recovery goal of 55% for all paper consumed in the U.S. by 2012.
However, if domestic and export demand for recovered paper grows, the paper industry runs the risk of seeing existing paper and paperboard capacity idled due to insufficient supply.
The use of Flexographic Ink by the Providence Journal and the marketing limitations created for newsprint processed at the RI Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) was discussed by the subcommittee.
It was concluded that the Journal's switch to this ink type has positive environmental benefits with respect to effluents.
Unfortunately a number of recycled paper mills are not equipped to deink newsprint with Flexographic ink, and therefore not available as market for RI newsprint which is estimated to contain as much as 75 - 80% Flexographic-inked

newsprint from the Providence Journal.
(This `guesstimate' should be verified).
! Plastics Market The potential for Market Development for post-consumer plastic bottles in RI was discussed.
Committee members indicated that the entire annual volume of plastic bottles currently recovered from the waste stream and processed at the Materials Recycling Facility would not provide sufficient feedstock of either #1 High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) or #2 Polyethylene Terepthalate (PET) for a typical Plastics reclaimer or processor were a new facility to be sited in RI. Additional material from out of state would have to be imported to supplement material from the MRF if a plant were sited here.
Additionally, there are structural issues affecting the Plastic Markets.
According to the National Association for Plastic Container Recovery, reclamation capacity significantly exceeds supply of recovered bottles.
In 2001, 834mm lbs. of post-consumer bottles were purchased.
As of May 2003, U.S. PET reclamation capacity was 946mm lbs.
Â· Federal Market Development Effort Â­ EPA "Jobs Through Recycling Program"
The EPA's Jobs Through Recycling initiative was referenced in the previous edition of the Comprehensive plan.
JTR was established in 1994 with the goal of stimulating the development of businesses that: Â· Â· Utilize recovered materials that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated; and Contribute to economic growth and create/retain jobs.
EPA's Jobs Through Recycling initiative puts the tools of business development-- technology transfer, financing, and marketing--into the hands of recycling professionals.
JTR facilitates cooperation and communication among solid waste officials, economic development organizations, and businesses involved in collecting, processing, and remanufacturing recovered materials.
In achieving these results, JTR projects ranged from conducting composting demonstration projects in rural communities to organizing financing meetings with venture capitalists and other potential investors.
From 1994 to 1999, the JTR program offered a variety of grants to strengthen recycling market development and economic development programs.
In addition, the program developed and distributed market development information and facilitated the networking of recycling market development officials.
Through information sharing, JTR continues to support an active network of state and regional contacts who develop innovative programs and provide useful information to recyclers and related businesses.2

http://www.epa.gov/jtr/faq/index.htm#gen-1
2
The JTR program provided "seed funding" of $8 million to numerous states, tribes, and multistate organizations between 1994 and 1999.
This funding has helped create more than 8,500 jobs, generate $640.5 million in capital investment, create 15.3 million tons of capacity, and utilize 13.9 million tons of recovered materials.
One job has been created for every $1,040 of JTR grant money invested.3 In 1995, the program had $1.5 million available to fund regional (Region 1) programs.
RI DEM received $236, 000 to fund an Electronics disassembly and recycling operation.
The project was to be a public-private partnership with the German company Hetzel.
However, the project was not brought to fruition.
JTR funding situation in 2003 is considerably different than in 1995.
The program has a budget of only $20,000 for each EPA region.
As such, JTR's focus has shifted to "Fostering recycling market development by facilitating information exchange and providing networking opportunities."
JTR does this through various means including: 1.
National Market Development Roundtables: The JTR Roundtables are forums for market development officials to learn about current market development challenges and opportunities; gain knowledge about recent trends and issues facing various commodities; share expertise and information about best practices with other experts in the market development arena; and network with other market development professionals.4 2.
Information Sharing: One of the objectives of JTR is to promote information exchange among recycling market development professionals across the country.
As part of this effort, the JTR program has developed the following resources/publications for states and organizations: Â· JTRnet List serve 
3.
Publications: Â· "MarketShare" - A collection of effective market development strategies used by JTR grantees.6 Â· "JTR Success Stories" - A series of fact sheets documenting the success of JTR funded projects7.
EPA Recycling Economic Impact Study(s): The recycling and reuse industry is a significant force in the United States economy.
The purpose of the EPA Recycling Economic Impact (REI) Study was to quantify the industry's contributions to job creation and economic prosperity.
The first EPA REI Study, completed and released in July 2001, documented approximately 56,000 establishments that employ over 1.1 million 3 4 5 6 7

people, generate an annual payroll of nearly $37 billion, and gross over $236 billion annually.
(See APPENDIX 2 for more information) The study, commissioned by EPA in cooperation with 17 states and the National Recycling Coalition, identified 26 different types of recycling organizations, drawing from economic census and survey data.
Since its release, EPA and states have promoted the REI results to public and private lenders, elected officials, and economic development agencies at state, regional and national events.8 To date, over 20 states have released reports documenting the size of the recycling and reuse industries within their jurisdictions.
Though the report was released in 2001, much of the data on which the results are based dates back to 1997.
The purpose of this proposal is to initiate the planning stage of a second REI study.
In addition to the national REI study, numerous states assessed the economic impact of recycling and reuse in their state.
9 A Northeast regional study was also conducted by the Northeast Recycling Council, providing detailed analyses for that region of the country.10 REI II Proposal: EPA plans to partner with other Federal agencies as well as state and regional market development officials through its Jobs Through Recycling Program to develop a second study.
EPA plans to meet with staff at the federal Commerce and Labor Departments to discuss partnering opportunities for the second study.
The following tasks (w/ timeframe) are proposed for the project: Â· Establish a partnership among state, regional and national organizations to work on the project (FY03) Â· Conduct a scoping study to evaluate methodology, results and lessons learned from the initial study (FY03) Â· Develop a comprehensive work plan and obtain financing to implement the second study (FY04) Â· Obtain data, conduct economic modeling and analysis (FY05-05) Â· Prepare a final report and implement outreach strategy (FY06) Â· Regional Efforts / Northeast Recycling Council
The committee agreed that the size of Rhode Island and the nature of its economy present inherent limits to the potential scope of a formalized Recycling Market Development program.
An alternative would be to support what is being done regionally in this area by the Northeast Recycling Council (NERC).
NERC is a regional organization working directly with the state agencies of the 10 member states.
NERC is The full report is available at www.epa.gov/jtr/rei http://www.epa.gov/jtr/econ/rei-rw/efforts.htm 10 http://www.nerc.org/projects.html#cu3 8 9

unique in the Northeast, in that it is the only forum for cooperative research, collaborative action, and networking on regulatory, market and business development issues that link recycling and economic development.
Recycling Business Financing Seminar: In 2001, RIRRC partnered with NERC, EDC, The US Small Business Association (SBA), the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and Fleet Financial Services to sponsor a Recycling Business Financing Seminar.
The seminar was designed to assist those that work with small businesses to better understand the recycling industry, how recycling enterprises add value to the state's economy, and how recycling companies operate.
The goal of the training provided by the seminar was to assist the attending bankers, attorneys, accountants, economic developers and non-profit organizations to maximize their effectiveness when assisting recycling entrepreneurs with developing their business plans and obtaining necessary financing.
The Seminar was held in June at Bryant College in Smithfield, and featured several excellent presentations.
However, attendance at the seminar was limited, despite free attendance (made possible though sponsorships) and concerted marketing and promotion efforts by the sponsoring organizations.
Newspaper Recycled Content Law: In 1991, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed Rhode Island General Law 23-18.16 requiring all publishers to purchase a minimum of forty percent (40%) post-consumer material for their publications annually by the year 2001.
Beginning in 1997 NERC spearheaded a ten state collaborative effort to expand the use of recycled content newsprint region.
Concern about meeting stateestablished recycled content goals of 40% prompted publishers in several Northeast states to urge a reassessment of the goals.
The lack of new investments in recycling capacity by manufacturers supplying finished newsprint to the region since 1995 was at the root of their concern.
In recognition of this fact, state-recycling officials and publishers in the Northeast agreed to establish the Northeast Newspaper Recycling Task Force to determine whether out-year goals were attainable.
NERC, with its history of monitoring the availability of recycled newsprint in the region and of maintaining a dialogue between publishers and states, was chosen to organize and lead this effort.
NERC entered into a dialogue with publishers in the region and with partial funding from the U.S. EPA established the Northeast Newspaper Recycling Task Force, comprised of NERC members and some of the region's large publishers.
Members of the Task Force funded a study of recycled newsprint manufacturing capacity.
The objective of this new approach was to drive additional investments in, and maximum utilization of, recycled-fiber based manufacturing capacity by the North American newsprint industry, thereby sustaining the economics of old newspaper recycling in the Northeast.
The Task Force worked throughout 1998 to develop a new regional policy affecting Northeast publishers' purchases of recycled-content newsprint.
The Task Force's Final Report and recommendations were published 5
in January 1999.
(The full Task Force report and resolution can be viewed on the NERC web site11.)
In 1999, NERC states adopted a regional policy because: Â· A regional policy and reporting system better reflects the regional nature of the industry and markets (e.g., newspaper publishers buy newsprint and sell papers regionally, without regard for state boundaries; and newsprint manufacturers and old newspaper recycling firms operate in regional markets.)
A regional approach promotes more uniformity of goals, and provides an opportunity to include publishers in New Jersey and Delaware where "buy recycled" newsprint agreements or laws are not currently in place.
By acting in concert, publishers and states send a stronger market signal to newsprint manufacturers that recycled-content newsprint is the preferred product in the marketplace.
Â· Â·
Under this new approach, large newspapers and newspaper groups selling into the region were asked to endorse a resolution committing them to purchase newsprint containing a minimum level of recycled fiber content newsprint annually.
This minimum level, or floor, would be based on the purchase of recycled fibers and would have to average at least 27 percent of total fiber purchases each year.
Once endorsements were received committing 80% of the regional annual tonnage of newsprint to the goal of achieving an average 27% recycled content rate, the full implementation period would begin.
At that time NERC staff would be responsible for tracking publishers' annual recycled-content purchases, including administering surveys, and compiling and reporting results.
State publisher associations and the Newspaper Association of America would assist NERC in coordinating this effort.
Thanks to the efforts of the Newspaper Association of America, As of July 27, 2001 this long desired goal has been achieved.
As of that date 86% of the annual newsprint consumption in the region has endorsed the agreement.
Thus, the monitoring and evaluation period now begins.
Letters have been sent to each of the signatory publishers asking for baseline data for average recycled content in calendar year 2000.

RI abstained from the NERC vote on the resolution for the agreement because of the inconsistencies in recycled content targets.
DEM is currently compiling a report for the General Assembly.
The Department may recommend amendments to the Rhode Island statute that will mirror the NERC newspaper publishers' agreement due to of the regional nature of the industry and because they lack the resources to oversee a state program.12 A compendium of other completed and current NERC market development projects can be found on their web site.13 Â· 12 13

The committee reviewed a survey of other states' Market Development Programs (APPENDIX 3).
The survey is not comprehensive but illustrates the diversity in the size and scope of these programs.
Some states have no formalized program, and others have organized programs with a diverse range of staffing and funding levels.
The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) maintains the nation's largest Recycling Market Development program with a staff of 70 and a budget of $7,000,000 (2002).
The CIWMB manages a low-interest loan program that has funded over 113 loans totaling more than $60 million since 1993.
CIWMB also administers the Recycling Market Development Zone Program that provides financial and technical assistance to recycling businesses.14 See the CIWMB web site for information.15 Â· Priority Materials16
There is a high degree of consistency among the states with market development programs in terms of their top priority materials for market development.
The top three materials are: 1.
Electronics 2.
Organics/Food Wastes 3.
Construction and Demolition Debris Several states are also targeting additional materials as second-tier priorities.
These materials include 1.
Carpet 2.
Plastics 3.
Tires While states are continuing to expend some market development resources on traditional curbside recyclables, there is a notable reduction in the scope of programs targeting these materials.
Â· Market Development Strategies for Priority Materials17
States are continuing to implement a variety of approaches to fostering markets for recyclable materials.
Following is a summary of the menu of market development strategies currently being employed by state governments.
Product Stewardship/Extended Product Responsibility: Product Stewardship and Extended Product Responsibility are the newest and, perceived my many states, to be the most promising market development approach.
While few states have formal PS or EPR policies, programs or laws, several are pursuing dialogues with industry segments to leverage voluntary commitments to design products for recyclability and the 14 15 16 17

environment, and to more fully share in the management and costs of the recovery and recycling infrastructure.
(PS or EPR initiatives have been addressed in detail the Source Reduction/Waste Prevention Subcommittee report).
Grants and loans: Specialized grant and loans programs for recycling businesses have traditionally been a core market development approach used by many states, particularly populous states with large recycling and solid waste budgets and staffs.
These programs continue to be a primary tool, however, funding is not available at the levels or for the wide-range of projects as was the case 7-10 years ago.
States are now more closely linking the types of projects funded with overall solid waste management priorities, and conducting more thorough due-diligence to ensure that projects selected for funding achieve projected results.
Environmentally preferable purchasing and buy recycled: Buy recycled, and more recently "EPP" programs, have also been a common approach used by states market developers over the last ten years.
Notably, traditional buy recycled initiatives are now being broaden to encompass environmentally preferable criteria that capture full life cycle impacts associated with products.
These programs have also expanded beyond paper and other standard recyclables, and are now moving to new frontiers such as electronics and green building materials.
In addition, states environmental agencies are continuing to look for ways to broaden the public sector organizations with buy recycled and EPP programs to include other agencies such as DOTs and Parks and Recreation, as well as local governments.
(EPP initiatives have been addressed in the Source Reduction/Waste Prevention Subcommittee report).
Linking Economic Development and Recycling Market Development: Several states have institutionalized linkages between their recycling market development and economic development agencies.
For instance, several states applied seed funding from EPA's JTR grants program to hire recycling market development staff within the department of economic development.
A number of states have made these positions permanent.
Providing Targeted Assistance to Recycling Enterprises: In addition to, or in the place of, direct financial assistance states are providing recycling enterprises with a range of resources, including business plan development, technical assistance and identifying alternative sources of financing.
Since these types of assistance are not typically found within environmental protection agencies, the states are developing partnerships with other agencies and organizations to deliver the services, including manufacturing extensions, SBDCs, and regional multi-state organizations.
For more in-depth information on top priority materials and market development approaches, see accompanying bibliography of web-based resources (APPENDIX 2).
Â· Massachusetts Market Development Center Model Â­ Chelsea Center 9
The committee discussed The Chelsea Center for Environmental and Economic Development in Massachusetts as a potential model for Rhode Island.
The state of Massachusetts in Partnership with the University Massachusetts launched the Chelsea Center for Recycling and Economic Development in 1995 to create jobs, support recycling efforts, and help the economy and the environment by working to increase the use of recyclables by manufacturers.
The Chelsea Center was part of the University of Massachusetts.
It was formed through the Strategic Technology Partnership (STEP) Program, a partnership between the University of Massachusetts, the state Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, and the Massachusetts Office of Business Development.
Funding comes primarily from the STEP Program and the Clean Environment Fund (CEF).
The CEF is comprised of unredeemed bottle deposits, and is managed by the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs.
Although a successful program, the Chelsea Center was disbanded on June 30th 2003.
Information on the program can be found on the Chelsea Center web site www.chelseacenter.org, which is still accessible.
Â· Pennsylvania Â­ Consultant Research for Market Development Center
The subcommittee determined that a potential recommendation might be for a consultant to explore the potential for market development in Rhode Island.
Following this determination, the work done by consultant RW Beck for Pennsylvania was obtained and reviewed by the subcommittee.
It was subsequently decided by the subcommittee to use this project as an example of how Rhode Island might proceed were it to engage a consultant.
The State of Pennsylvania's context for market development differs markedly from that of Rhode Island in that there are recycling end-markets within the state.
Pennsylvania hired the consultant R.W. Beck to assist with the development of a Market Development Program and Center, and what approach should be taken by the state.
RW Beck's principal hypothesis for its work was the following: Given the nature of the U.S. and global economy, the marketplace is the primary, and preferred, mechanism for allocating resources (e.g., secondary materials, recycled products, labor, capital, and equipment).
The role of state government in promoting market development is to identify and address inefficiencies in the marketplace.18 Through its work for the State of Pennsylvania, RW Beck produced the following reports19: 1.

Principles of Approach - The Role of State Government in Recycling Market Development Â­ May 2003 The RW Beck project consisted of two phases: 1.
Phase 1 was all five of the above reports that have been done to date.
2.
Phase 2 includes the Strategic Plan and the business and implementation plans for the Market Development Center.
The business plan for the operation of a Pennsylvania market development center is expected to be released this fall.
Pennsylvania DEP has offered to provide a copy of the RFP issued for this project to Rhode Island.20 Pennsylvania's budget for Phase I and Phase II of the RW Beck project is $247,128 and thus far they are under budget.
Â· Existing RI Market Development Initiatives
Despite the State not having a formalized Market Development program, there are several market development related initiatives currently being supported by RIRRC.
1.
Alkahest prototype mollusk shell recycling system - In 2002, RIRRC provided a grant for the development of a process to process to clean, sanitize and recycle clam shells, to construct an integrated prototype system for processing over 2000 pounds of shells per hour.
2.
Recycling for RI Education Â­ Annually since 1998, RIRRC has provided grants to fund the continued operations of Recycling for the RI Education (RRIE) `Recycle Center'.
RRIE diverts clean, non-toxic materials from manufacturers for use by RI educators with their children.
3.
Southern New England Materials Exchange (SNEME) Â­ In May of 2003 RIRRC provided a grant to the RI Export Assistance Center to develop and implement a new web-based Business Materials Exchange.
The exchange would link business generating `waste' materials with organizations that can utilize the materials.
4.
Residential Internet-based Reuse Exchange Â­ In July 2003 RIRRC awarded a contract to Eureka Recycling of St. Paul MN to implement the RI "Free Market."
The Free Market will link individuals seeking used household-related items with those interested in giving away those items.

Marine BioConversion (MBC) squid waste utilization project - With financial assistance from the Slater Center for Environmental Biotechnology, MBC has been working on converting squid processing wastes that are currently landfilled or barged out for ocean dumping into high value specialty aquaculture feed ingredients and seafood flavors.
MBC is seeking additional funding to prove that this "Bioconversion" can be a viable approach to solving the waste disposal problems while simultaneously gaining economic return.21 2.
Glass Cullet Â­ Applications for Glass cullet such as aggregate could offer alternatives to use as a supplement to Alternate Daily Cover.
Whether or not his would be necessary will depend on the volume of cullet generated by the MRF and the capacity of Recovermat to utilize all the cullet available.
At least one municipality has expressed interest in utilizing glass cullet as aggregate in construction projects.
3.
RIRRC Industrial Park Â­ Planning underway for the construction of an industrial park adjacent to RIRRC facilities could potentially site firms whose business involved recovering materials from the waste stream and processing recovered materials to create value-added products.
Â· Other Items reviewed by the Subcommittee
Recycled Rubber Roads Act of 2003 Â­ Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) has introduced the Recycled Roads Act of 2003.
The act is similar to the rubber roads provision that the Institute of Scrap Recycling (ISRI)22 has been attempting to insert into the omnibus highway bill, TEA 21.
The bill would establish a program to increase the use of recyclable material in the construction of Federal-aid highways.
ISRI Staff and members of the ISRI Tire Division are working with Bingaman's office and members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to move this effort forward.
The ultimate goal is to insert a provision into the research section of TEA 21.
The provision would not be mandatory, and would not come out of any state's share of highway funds.
It would provide grants for education of contractors and state engineers, etc.23 The subcommittee also agreed that two items identified in the previous comprehensive plan should be reevaluated and potentially revived: 1.
Local Recycling Markets List Â­ DEM used to maintain a list of businesses throughout the region that accepted materials for recycling.
The list of potential markets would be helpful to companies generating recyclable materials and seeking to divert these materials from their waste stream.
This function could potentially be served by the SNEME and should be explored by RIRRC as it proceeds with this project.

2.
Recycled Products Directory Â­ In 1997 DEM produced a directory of recycled products available targeted at municipal purchasing officials.
However, the directory needs to be updated and DEM does not possess the resources to do so at this time.
National information on recycled plastic products (and markets) is available on the American Plastics Council's Plastic Resource web site.24 Conclusion Fundamental to the context of Market Development in Rhode Island is the consideration of the state's size.
None of the materials processed at the MRF are shipped to endmarkets within the state with the exception of scrap metal.
In addition, there is currently no State Agency or Department focusing on Recycling Market Development.
Given funding and staff limitations, DEM has not continued pursuing market development initiatives that were initiated in the 1990s.
A program could potentially be operated by RIRRC, Economic Development Corporation or another entity such at the URI Center for Pollution Prevention.
In addition, instituting a Market Development program would likely require legislative action or a mandate from the Governor to an agency.
The Committee discussed what potential funding sources might be including the hard-to-dispose advance disposal fee; tip fee surcharge, or beverage container deposits.
Several of these revenue sources are utilized to fund programs in other states.
However, their applicability and potential applications in Rhode Island appears remote at this time.
No conclusion was reached by the subcommittee on a viable funding source for a Market Development program in RI given the current state/agency budget situation.
The dearth of an available/identifiable funding source remains a significant obstacle to the creation of a formalized Market Development program.

Solid Waste Plan Working Group DRAFT Market Development Subcommittee Report Â­ Appendices APPENDIX 1 About the REI Study1 Comprehensive, national data on the economic impact of recycling and reuse is critical to the continued growth and success of the industry.
With the release of the U.S. Recycling Economic Information Study, for the first time, public and private sector decision-makers now have a clear picture of the significant contribution recycling makes to our nation's economy.
The study: Â· Â· Â· Â· Demonstrates to the investment community that recycling is a viable, established industry with a proven track record.
Assists government agencies with strategic planning and policy decisions to ensure the continued growth of the industry.
Identifies business opportunities for entrepreneurs based on emerging commodity areas and industry sectors.
Provides recycling and reuse advocates with an important tool to help promote awareness and build support.
The multi-year REI project utilizes the best available data from 1997-1999.
The national study was accomplished through a comprehensive analysis of both existing economic data and reasonable estimates based on targeted surveys of recycling businesses and sophisticated economic modeling.
The study allows for sound economic comparisons across different regions and states in the country and establishes an important benchmark of the economic impact of recycling and reuse.
The study calculated three main types of data: Direct Economic Impacts The study evaluates economic data for 26 different types of reuse and recycling establishments--from local thrift stores to major paper recycling companies.
The study measures several different industry characteristics including the number of establishments, total jobs, annual payroll, annual receipts, and annual throughput (amount of materials collected and processed).
Indirect and Induced Economic Benefits This includes the professional services (e.g., accounting firms, office supply companies) used by recycling and reuse organizations (or "indirect" impacts) and the money spent by the people who work in the recycling and reuse industry (or "induced" impacts).
Federal, State, and Local Tax Revenues This includes taxes both directly paid by recycling and reuse establishments and an estimate of those resulting from indirect sources.
The study builds upon other regional and state-specific studies produced in the past, including a groundbreaking assessment of the economic impact of recycling in the northeast in 1994.
While informative, previous studies used different, inconsistent methodologies, which made it difficult to compare data from state to state.
By using one methodology, for the first time, the national study allows for sound comparisons across different regions and states.
