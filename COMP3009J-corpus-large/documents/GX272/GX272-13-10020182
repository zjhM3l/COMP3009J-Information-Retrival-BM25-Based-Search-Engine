The payment factor determined by the Department is not subject to appeal.

The Department shall make substitute breeders' awards if there are sufficient monies in the fund to allow for an award but not enough monies to provide for full payments of quarterly breeders' awards based on the quarterly breeders' award payment factor.
a.
The Department shall determine the substitute payment factor by dividing the total amount of monies in the Arizona breeders' award fund at the end of the quarter less the amount required to be set aside for contingent liabilities in subsection (D)(8) by the total amount of purses won by eligible Arizona-bred animals during that quarter.

The Department shall calculate substitute breeders' awards by multiplying the amount of each purse won by an eligible animal during that quarter by the substitute payment factor for that quarter.

c.
A breeder is eligible to receive a supplemental breeders' award from the end-of-year bonus pool only if the breeder received a substitute breeders' award during that fiscal year. d.

7.
End-of-year Bonus Awards.
The Department shall pay end-of-year bonus awards if monies remain in the end-ofyear bonus pool following any supplemental payments.
a.
The Department shall determine an end-of-year bonus payment factor by dividing the monies in the end-of-year bonus pool by the total amount of purses won by an eligible animal during the fiscal year. b.
The Department shall calculate end-of-year bonus awards by multiplying the amount of each purse won by an eligible animal by the bonus payment factor.
8.
Contingent liabilities.
The Department shall retain $10,000 in the Breeders' Award fund for contingent liabilities.
9.
The Department shall not make quarterly breeders' awards, substitute breeders' awards, supplemental breeders' awards or end-of-year bonus breeders' awards if the total amount available for distribution is less than $10,000.
In the event the Department does not pay an award because less than $10,000 is available for distribution, the Department shall carry forward the amount in the fund for payment of awards when the Department next calculates awards.
