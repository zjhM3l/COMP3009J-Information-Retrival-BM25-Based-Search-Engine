High School Science Agri-biology Agribiology for the Life Science component within the Science requirement Course Overview: This one-credit course uses agricultural contexts to present the life science content outlined in the Program Studies.
As students study practical agricultural concepts, they apply scientific ways of thinking and working to real-life problems.
During their study of agri-biology, students perform many practical tasks.
They create models, extract DNA, analyze DNA fingerprints, construct tables and graphs to classify and analyze data, and test soils.
Students also participate in cooperative and collaborative groups, use technology to solve problems, and participate in field trips to apply scientific concepts to agricultural and environmental problems.
Students develop an understanding of many concepts such as cell structure and function, morphology and physiology of agriculturally significant animals, heredity principles and inheritance patterns, genetic engineering, animal behavior, biological change, interdependence of plants and animals, and the flow of matter and energy through ecosystems.
Models are organized around guiding questions.
Guiding questions (in bold print) direct teachers' choices of activities and are the questions students should be able to answer at the end of the course.
Essential questions may be included to further focus student learning.
Pages of models are arranged in pairs.
On the left-hand page of each pair are guiding (in bold print) and essential questions along with related academic expectations and correlation to the and agri-biology content chart.
Sample activities and sample extensions for diverse learners are found on the right-hand page.
While sample activities address content or content from elective areas, they are not intended to be comprehensive.
Teachers still are responsible for planning instruction to meet the diverse needs of all their students.
