a.
Development of Lyocell: Lyocell is a new generic group that is biodegradable and environmentally sound.
It also blends well with other fibers.
b. Development of new recycling process : plastic soda bottles are converted into a polyester fiber that is used to make fabric for t-shirts and filling for pillows.
The fiber can be recycled numerous times without losing its performance attributes.
c. Development of microfibers (or microdenier fibers): microfibers are ultrafine, softer, and more luxurious than other fibers.
They possess the same desirable qualities as expensive natural fibers but caring for them is much easier and less costly.
d. Increase in use of blends: combining two fibers can improve the performance of a fabric.
A popular example is the addition of spandex in blends to give the fabric a "stretch" component.
e. Growing use of computer systems: manufacturers can service their customers more quickly and efficiently with the use of computer technology.
They also provide a communication link between various industries to better coordinate distribution activities.
New designs can be completed and executed much quicker with the use of the CAD computer application.
f. Competition in a global marketplace : increasing imports from competitors make it increasingly difficult for members of the fiber industry to compete in a domestic and international marketplace.
g. Demand for fur and leather: foreign markets are creating a demand for fur and leather.
The trade opportunities should boost sales and help the US textile industry.
h. Expansion of fiber usage : several industries, including medicine, transportation, space travel, and environment control, are finding new uses for fibers.
2.
Current fiber innovations a.
Production of fibers to mee t specific end uses : much emphasis is placed on using chemical compounds called polymers to create fabrics designed with specific end uses for the consumer and industrial markets.
b. New and modified fibers: experimental fibers are produced in s mall quantities in pilot plants.
An adequate amount of the fiber is produced so that the behavior of the fabrics and potential uses is investigated.
If research indicates that success of the fibers is likely, then they are produced in mass.

THE BURNING TEST FOR FIBER IDENTIFICATION Introduction: The burning test provides valuable information regarding care of fabrics and aids in identifying classes of fibers such as manufactured versus natural fibers and cellulose versus protein fibers.
When testing fibers, it is important to remember that a number of factors may alter the results.
The type of dyes, finishes, and combination of fibers used in the fabrics can change the flammability, odor, and the residue.
In blends, the fiber of greater percentage will become more evident.
While the burning test is fairly simple, use care to avoid injury and guard against the possibility of a fire.
The test may be conducted in a science lab, if available.
Procedures 1.
Obtain four swatches of fabrics made of natural fibers.
Obtain four swatches of manufactured fibers; one swatch of rayon, acetate, and two different swatches of fabrics made from acrylic, nylon, polyester, or spandex.
(8 swatches) 2.
Select two or a few yarns from the warp yarns (lengthwise) of the fabric or if any of the fabrics chosen are knits, unravel a length of yarn from the knitted garment(s).
Untwist the fibers so that they are loose.
3.
Using forceps, move the yarns toward the flame from the side and remove as soon as it begins to burn.
4.
Observe the following reactions: a.
The flame --Did it burn readily? Did it leave a glowing ember when the flame was extinguished? Did it self-extinguish with no ember? Did it melt, drip, and leave no ember when the flame was extinguished? Did it melt and not burn? b.
The odor--Odor can sometimes be unreliable since chemicals and inks added can alter the odor of the fiber itself.
Odor identification is primarily useful with natural cellulose and protein-based fibers.
Cellulosic fibers will smell like paper burning and protein fibers normally smell like hair burning.
c.
The residue --The residue is usually very distinctive.
Cellulosic fibers leave almost no residue except for a very soft white ash which leaves a smudge when rubbed with the fingers.
Protein fibers curl away from the flame and bead up.
The residue is light and forms a very brittle cinder which is easily crushed.
Manufactured fibers draw away from the flame and melt into beads that drip into molten globs.
These beads solidify into a hard mass when cooled and are difficult to crush.
Edges of the fabric usually fuse together into a hard beaded edge.
5. Record the reactions of each fiber tested for flammability, odor, and type of residue remaining and answer each of the questions based on your observations and conclusions.

Obtain four swatches of fabrics made of natural fibers.
Obtain four swatches of manufactured fibers; one swatch of rayon, acetate, and two different swatches of fabrics made from acrylic, nylon, polyester, or spandex.
(8 swatches) 2.
Select two or a few yarns from the warp yarns (lengthwise) of the fabric or if any of the fabrics chosen are knits, unravel a length of yarn from the knitted garment(s).
Untwist the fibers so that they are loose.
3.
Using forceps, move the yarns toward the flame from the side and remove as soon as it begins to burn.
4.
Observe the following reactions: a.
The flame --Did it burn readily? Did it leave a glowing ember when the flame was extinguished? Did it self-extinguish with no ember? Did it melt, drip, and leave no ember when the flame was extinguished? Did it melt and not burn? b.
The odor--Odor can sometimes be unreliable since chemicals and inks added can alter the odor of the fiber itself.
Odor identification is primarily useful with natural cellulose and protein-based fibers.
Cellulosic fibers will smell like paper burning and protein fibers normally smell like hair burning.
c.
The residue --The residue is usually very distinctive.
Cellulosic fibers leave almost no residue except for a very soft white ash which leaves a smudge when rubbed with the fingers.
Protein fibers curl away from the flame and bead up.
The residue is light and forms a very brittle cinder which is easily crushed.
Manufactured fibers draw away from the flame and melt into beads that drip into molten globs.
These beads solidify into a hard mass when cooled and are difficult to crush.
Edges of the fabric usually fuse together into a hard beaded edge.
5. Record the reactions of each fiber tested for flammability, odor, and type of residue remaining and answer each of the questions based on your observations and conclusions.

A-28 (Page 2 of 3) (key) THE BURNING TEST FOR FIBER IDENTIFICATION 1.
Which flame was cotton and rayon and fiber(s) reacted to the flame by burning readily and leaving a glowing ember when the extinguished? flax (natural cellulosic) acetate (manufactured cellulosic)
2.
Which fiber(s) reacted to the flame by self-extinguishing with no ember? wool, silk (natural protein)
3.
Which fiber(s) reacted by melting, dripping and forming a hard mass? acetate, acrylic, nylon, polyester (all manufactured)
4.
Which fiber(s) produced a smell similar to burning paper or wood? cotton, flax, rayon (natural and manufactured cellulosic)
5.
Which fiber(s) produced a smell resembling burning hair? silk and wool (natural protein)
6.
Which fiber(s) reacted by leaving a soft white ash resulting in a smudge when rubbed? cotton and flax (natural cellulosic)
7.
Evaluate the answers to each of the previous questions.
You will find that the fibers you listed for each question have a common factor.
(Ex. the most likely answers to the first question will be cotton and flax, and rayon and acetate--they are all cellulosic natural or cellulosic manufactured fibers.)
What is the common factor for answers to each of the other questions? Fabrics that burn quickly and have a glowing ember are cellulosic or plant-based.
Fabrics that reacted by self-extinguishing with no ember are fibers which are good flame- retardants.
Fabrics that melted and dripped are generally manufactured plastics and are not good flame- retardants.
