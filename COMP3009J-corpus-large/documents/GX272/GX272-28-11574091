Plan Market Development Subcommittee Draft 5-29-03 Meeting Minutes The first meeting of the Market Development Subcommittee was held at RIRRC on May 29, 2003.
In attendance were: Claude Cote (RIRRC), Patrick Fingliss (RIRRC), Leo Hellested (DEM), Dante Ionata, Eugene Park (URI Center for Pollution Prevention), and John Trevor (RIRRC).
Subcommittee members not present were Mark Adelman (Governor's Office), Shim Silverstein (United Paper Stock).
Dante announced at the meeting that Andrew Dzykewicz, from the Economic Development Corporation would be representing EDC going forward.
! Market Development Defined Market Development Â­ the committee sought to define "Market Development" in the framework of Solid Waste Management.
It was agreed that in this context, Market Development would be considered activities that provided or stimulated the demand for materials recovered for recycling or the utilization of material(s) that would have otherwise been disposed of in the landfill.
! Other States' Programs The committee reviewed a survey (below) of other states' Market Development Programs.
The size and scope of these programs varies dramatically.
Some states (like RI) have no formalized program, and others have organized programs with a diverse range of staffing and funding levels.
California maintains the Nation's largest program with a staff of 90 and a budget of $7,000,000 to support to Recycling Market Development initiatives.
(A handout on California's Program was also distributed).
More information can be found on this program at http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Markets/ .
! Location 
Such a program could be operated by either RIRRC, EDC or another entity.
However, a potential funding source for a program does not presently exist.
The Committee discussed what potential funding sources might be including the hard-to-dispose advance disposal fee , tip fee surcharge, or federal grants.
However, no conclusion was reached on how a Market Development program might be funded.
The committee discussed The Chelsea Center for Environmental and Economic Development in Massachusetts.
The state of Massachusetts in Partnership with the University Massachusetts launched the Chelsea Center for Recycling and Economic Development in 1995 to create jobs, support recycling efforts, and help the economy and the environment by working to increase the use of recyclables by manufacturers.
The Chelsea Center is a part of the University of Massachusetts.
It was formed through the Strategic Technology Partnership (STEP) Program, a partnership between the University of Massachusetts, the state Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, and the Massachusetts Office of Business Development.
Funding comes primarily from the STEP Program and the Clean Environment Fund (CEF).
The CEF is comprised of unredeemed bottle deposits, and is managed by the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs.
Information about the Chelsea Center can be found at http://www.chelseacenter.org .
The potential to replicate a program like the Chelsea Center would require action on the part of the legislature and/or the Governor's office.
! Rhode Island Situation 
An alternative would be to support what is being done regionally in this area by the Northeast Recycling Council (NERC).
NERC is a regional organization working directly with the state agencies of the 10 member states.
NERC is unique in the Northeast, in that it is the only forum for cooperative research, collaborative action, and networking on regulatory, market and business development issues that link recycling and economic development.
(See NERC fact attached to email).
In 2001, RIRRC partnered with NERC, EDC, The US Small Business Association (SBA), the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and Fleet Financial Services to sponsor a Recycling Business Financing Seminar.
The seminar was designed to assist those that work with small businesses to better understand the recycling industry, how recycling enterprises add value to the state's economy, and how recycling companies operate.
The goal of the training provided by the seminar was to assist the attending bankers, attorneys, accountants, economic developers and non-profit organizations to maximize their effectiveness when assisting recycling entrepreneurs with developing their business plans and obtaining necessary financing.
The Seminar was held in June at Bryant College in Smithfield, and featured several excellent presentations.
However, attendance at the seminar was limited, despite free attendance (made possible though sponsorships) and concerted marketing and promotion efforts by the sponsoring organizations.
! Economic Considerations 
China's role as a primary market for fiber and steel was recognized.
A copy of an April Wall Street Journal Article was distributed (attached) indicating that the China is currently the largest market for U.S. Scrap exports, accounting for 23% or $1.2 billion in 2002.
According to the RI Export Assistance Center, scrap and waste was Rhode Island's second largest export category in 2002, for a total value of $144,787,758.
o Fiber Market Shim Silverstein indicated the SARS epidemic was having a detrimental effect on the fiber market, and United Paper Stock's ability to market its product.
It was his opinion that fundamental to all market development efforts was a strong global economy, and that this would create demand for secondary fiber and other materials.
Currently more than 80% of all paper mills in the U.S. use recovered paper to make their products, and nearly 200 mills use exclusively recovered paper.
The American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA) has set a recovery goal of 55% for all paper consumed in the U.S. by 2012.
However, if domestic and export demand for recovered paper grows, the paper industry runs the risk of seeing existing paper and paperboard capacity idled due to insufficient supply.

The use of Flexographic Ink by the Providence Journal and the marketing limitations created for newsprint processed at the RI Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) was discussed.
It was concluded that the Journal's switch to this ink type has positive environmental benefits with respect to effluents.
Unfortunately a number of recycled paper mills are not equipped to deink newsprint with Flexographic ink, and therefore not available as market for RI newsprint which is estimated to contain as much as 75 - 80% Flexographic inked newsprint fro the Providence Journal.
(This `guesstimate' should be verified). o Plastics Market The potential for Market Development for post-consumer plastic bottles in RI was discussed.
Committee members indicated that the entire annual volume of plastic bottles currently recovered from the waste stream and processed at the Materials Recycling Facility would not provide sufficient feedstock of either #1 High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) or #2 Polyethylene Terepthalate (PET) for a typical Plastics reclaimer or processor were a new facility to be sited in RI. Additional material from out of state would have to be imported to supplement material from the MRF if a plant were sited here.
Additionally, there are structural issues affecting the Plastic Markets.
According to the National Association for Plastic Container Recovery, reclamation capacity significantly exceeds supply of recovered bottles.
In 2001, 834mm lbs. of post-consumer bottles were purchased.
As of May 2003, U.S. PET reclamation capacity was 946mm lbs. ! URI Center for Pollution Prevention Gene Park from the Center from Pollution Prevention reported on Pending Pollution Prevention Legislation heard in the House Environment Committee on the previous day.
(At the time of this writing, I do not know the status of this legislation) While the focus of the legislation (attached to email) is on pollution prevention and source reduction, it could potentially have market development implications.
The Center was involved in research on transforming squid waste into an Aquaculture product.
This endeavor was similar to a project being undertaken by Alkahest to manufacture a machine that processes clamshells.
RIRRC provided startup funding for this project, which was also funded by the Slater Center for Marine and Environmental technology.
! Review of Previous Plan's Market Development Recommendations The subcommittee reviewed the recommendations in the Market Development section of the previous Comprehensive Plan: Â· DEM and URI should continue remanufacturing research and devise a technology transfer strategy and explore funding opportunities.
Â· DEM should promote recycled product procurement by state agencies and quasi-state agencies that do not use the state's purchasing system extensively.
Page 3 of 11
Â· DEM should focus future efforts regarding use of recycling emblems on influencing a national standard through NERC.
Â· DEM needs more funding to properly implement market development programs.
Â· DEM and the Corporation should continue involvement in regional market development efforts through NERC.
The Committee agreed that given the funding situation at DEM currently, and in the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that DEM will have a role in Market Development.
The Corporation and DEM continue to provide funding to NERC and be involved in regional market development efforts.
! Subcommittee Tasks Procedurally, two potential objectives for the subcommittee were identified: 1.
Develop the framework for a Market Development Program to incorporate into the plan, or 2.
Recommend the initiation of a Market Development exploration project undertaken by a consultant.
Other states such as Pennsylvania have employed this option.
It was agreed by the subcommittee that the first option would not be feasible undertaking for the subcommittee given the scope of such an undertaking and the time and resources available.
It was determined that the subcommittee should discuss the potential for a RI Market Development Study at the next meeting and determine what the elements of such a study should be potential organizations or consultants who might be engaged for the study.
In addition, the format and element s of the subcommittee's report to the Working Group in August will also be discussed.
