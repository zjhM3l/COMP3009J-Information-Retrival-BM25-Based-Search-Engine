Nick Choy, State Public Affairs Office Mobilization ceremony in Eugene honors ORARNGÃ¯Â¿Â½s 2-162 on Oct. 29.
Nearly 700 troops will head to Ft. Hood TX, before forward deploying to the Middle East.
According to investigators, the fire was started by Saddam loyalists.
Dooley said the region surrounding Mosul is surrounded by small villages, sheep herders and wheat farms.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The people in the villages gave us water, watermelons, and teaÃ¯Â¿Â½they were friendly,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dooley said.
He felt that in spite of the wounds he sustained, serving in Iraq with B-52 was a worthwhile experience.
According to Lt. Col. William J. Schutz, commander of the 1249 th Engineer Battalion, Dooley and the other members of the battalion who were transferred to B-52 when it was mobilized are ready to face any challenge in Iraq.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We are proud of all the soldiers we transferred over.Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Schutz.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We are sure that the skills they have learned and performed at the 1249th Engineer Battalion have prepared them well for the missions they are accomplishing in Iraq.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dooley, a resident of Bend, Ore., has begun physical therapy since returning to the United States.
He is looking forward to a quick recovery and a return to the Mt. Bachelor Ski Resort where he is a member of its receiving department.
Ã¯Â¿Â½My boss, John Petrich, has been very supportive from the very start of the mobilization,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dooley said.
For his combat wounds, Dooley was awarded the Purple Heart.

John C. Driscoll Public Affairs Representative, 1249th Engineer Battalion Ã¯Â¿Â½IÃ¯Â¿Â½m glad to be home but didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to come home this way.
I wanted to come home when I was supposed to,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Sgt. Brian Dooley while reflecting on his premature homecoming after being wounded during an attack on September 11.
At the time of the attack, Dooley had been in Iraq for five months, serving with Bravo Co. 52nd Engineers, a unit he transferred into for Operation Enduring Freedom from Company A 1249th Engineer Battalion.
He was escorting a convoy near the city of Mosul in Northern Iraq when the convoy came under enemy attack.
Dooley and his counterpart received gunshot wounds in the ambush, which took place as the unit was bringing Winter 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 7 Oregon Army NG participates in 116th ACS member first enlisted extraordinary rescue in California weapons controller in Air Guard By Chief Warrant Officer Doug Walker, Special to the Oregon Sentinel It began with a late night phone call on October 5, 2003.
How long would it take to fly a Chinook Helicopter from Pendleton, Ore. to Bishop, Calif. a distance of 575 Statute Miles? Do you have the power to rescue an injured climber in the Sierra Nevada Mountains at the 13,000 foot level? CW2 David Long, the Operations Officer and Standardization Instructor Pilot of Det 1, Co.
D, 113th Aviation Unit fielded the call.
After some quick figuring, Long confirmed it could be done.
He made several phone calls to alert crewmembers, and began to plan the mission and set about putting together the extended range fuel system.
Aside from Long, the crew consisted of Instructor Pilot, CW3 Doug Walker, First Sergeant and Flight Engineer, Spec. 1st Class Scott McCoy, Standardization Flight Engineer Instructor Sgt. Todd Albertson, Flight Engineer Instructor Sgt.
Andy Rhoden, and Spec.
Adrian Stump as the Crew Chief.
The helicopter and crew arrived in Bishop, California after a 3.5-hour, 575-mile, non-stop flight.
They were met by Sgt. Randy Nixon of the Inyo County Sheriff 's Depar tment, and a Search and Rescue (SAR) Coordinator for a briefing of the situation.
According to the SAR Coordinator, a hiker had fallen about 100 feet while climbing on Split Mountain in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
The injured man, a doctor from Long Beach, California, had suffered a broken ankle, broken fibula, broken wrist, and a laceration to the right forearm.
His climbing partner had to leave him overnight with only a fleece jacket, while he went for help.
An Inyo County SAR team was already with the injured hiker, having arrived on scene Sunday, and awaited a more powerful helicopter to airlift the hiker off the mountain.
The Chinook departed Bishop for the 22.5-mile flight to Split Mountain.
This rescue wasn't going to be an easy one.
The hoist cable on the CH-47D helicopter wasn't long enough to drop straight down to the injured climber, and the ledge on which the patient and his rescuers were perched was so narrow the helicopter couldn't get very close to the cliff.
One of the rescuers had to climb out on the ledge while the helicopter maneuvered as close as possible.
The Flight Engineer then swung the hoist cable back and forth so the rescuer on the ledge could grab onto it, and attach it to the basket.
Then the basket had to be pulled toward the helicopter at an angle, as the rescuers on the ledge helped to stabilize the basket and keep it from swinging while being winched upward.
After the injured doctor was secured in the helicopter, it descended from the mountain and returned to Bishop where the patient was transferred to a waiting ambulance.
After refueling, the helicopter returned to Split Mountain to recover the SAR team and their gear.
Since there was no place for the Chinook to land, the helicopter crew had to hoist each of the seven-man SAR team and their two loads of gear individually.
Even while the crew was wrapping up their mission, Nixon learned of another overdue climber.
But after some quick investigation by the SAR team, the second climber was found to be safe.
During the debriefing by the California Sheriff 's Department, the team determined that it would have taken a ground rescue seven days, and nearly 100 people to accomplish what the Chinook did in a few hours.
After a good night's rest the Chinook Helicopter crew returned to Pendleton, Ore., knowing they had accomplished something out of the ordinary.

Sgt.
Homer Walden in front of some of the equipment he utilizes in his role as weapons controller for the 116th Air Control Squadron.
By Maj. Donna Prigmore, Public Affairs Officer, HQ, ORANG Tech Sgt.
Homer Walden, a weapons controller in the Oregon Air GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s 116th Air Control Squadron in Warrenton, made history this past summer when he became the first Air National Guard enlisted weapons director to graduate from Advanced Weapons Director School.
The six-month long school Ã¯Â¿Â½ held at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada Ã¯Â¿Â½ was established in 2000 for enlisted weapons directors with at least three years of experience and an in-depth knowledge of air control operations.
The intent of the curriculum is to give seasoned active duty and Guard airmen and women an opportunity to train (at an advanced level) in a high stress, simulated wartime environment with multiple airframes flying actual combat-style missions.
Weapons directors, whether conducting real-world missions or training, communicate closely with fighter pilots in the sky to help them identify enemies and determine when and where to launch missile strikes.
The directors (also referred to as controllers) use tactical radar units, scopes, and communication modules to scan large airspace for immediate threats to security and take action to eliminate them.
Walden, a ground-based weapons controller with more than eight years of air control experience, served as the class leader for AWDS Class 03-1.
He graduated, along with a handful of active duty students, on June 13, 2003 to become the first weapons director in the ANG to attend the course.
Due to the complexity of the mission, each class is made up of only six students, with a 50/50 split between ground and air-based controllers.
Across the U.S., there are approximately 500 controllers, 300 of which scan the skies using groundbased equipment.
The other 200 operate as controllers in the sky while flying on board Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft.
According to Walden, the AWDS curriculum was developed, in part, from programs and syllabi already in place at the Fighter Weapons School (FWS), which is also conducted at Nellis AFB.
The FWS operates a rigorous training program for aeronautically-rated officers who pass a difficult screening process and are selected to become weapons officers.
The officer-based FWS and the enlisted-based AWDS are held concurrently in order to maximize training among and between pilots and weapons controllers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The staff at the (AWDS) schoolhouse use a building block approach by starting with small (combat) missions before introducing larger and larger ones,Ã¯Â¿Â½ explained Walden.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s a very challenging course that requires a lot of experience.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Before the enlisted students are exposed to combat missions however, they are instructed on operational details of each aircraft in the Air Force inventory, including all bombers, fighters, refuelers, and NATO aircraft.
According to Walden, knowing the different types of aircraft and their capabilities is important because of the partnership they have with fighter pilots in the air.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We control combat aircraft when they are performing their combat mission, whether it be air-to-air combat, combat air patrols, close-air support, or air-to-air refueling.
ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s a tough part of the curriculum but itÃ¯Â¿Â½s definitely needed.Ã¯Â¿Â½ According to Tech.
Sgt. James Peters, NCOIC of standards and evaluations at AWDS, enlisted personnel were barred from serving as weapons directors up until 1993, when the results of a General Accounting Office study spawned personnel changes.
Since then, hundreds of enlisted weapons directors have entered the career field and attended the required nine-month basic technical school in Arizona.
The school includes six months of training at the Tucson Air National Guard Base and three months of training on modular equipment at Luke AFB.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The Guard and active duty (enlisted) weapons directors are just about par with each other,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Peters, when asked if any differences exist between the two military organizations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½They (the Air Guard) are getting tasked as much as we are these days and really stepping up to the challenges.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Winter 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 8 Oregon Army National Guard units receive deployment excellence award Arlington, Virginia.
The awards were presented by the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, Maj. Gen. Claude V. Christianson, on behalf of the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Peter J. Schoomaker.
The 1st Battalion, 186th Infantry Regiment mobilized and deployed in April 2002, from Ashland, Ore. as part of a Multinational Force and observer mission in Sinai, Egypt.
The Oregon National Guard won both the small and large-size unit categories.
Accepting the award were Lt. Col. Dan Cameron and Lt. Col. Todd Plimpton, past and current commanders of 1st Battalion, 186th Inf, respectively.
The 1042nd Medical Company (Air Ambulance) mobilized and deployed from Salem, Ore. in April 2002, to Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Desert Spring, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.
Maj. Matt Brady and Capt. Tom Lingle, past and current commanders of the unit were on hand to accept the awards.
The Deployment Excellence Awards (DEA) recognizes excellence in deployment operations and is co-sponsored by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4 (Logistics) and the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3 (Operations) and administered by the Commander, U.S. Army Transportation Center.
The objectives of the DEAs recognize units and installations for outstanding deployment accomplishments which meet or exceed established deployment standards, and to capture and share innovative deployment initiatives which have improved the deployment process.
The program promotes competition at the unit and major command level and provides award recognition at the Department of the Army level.
The DEA recognized active Army, Army Reserve and Army National Guard organizations that have achieved the highest levels of readiness in executing their deployments. l to r: Maj. Mathew J.

Strong, State Public Affairs Officer The Oregon Army National GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s 1st Battalion, 186th Infantry and the 1042 Medical Company (Air Ambulance), from Ashland and Salem respectively, were recognized for deployment excellence at a ceremony held on August 27, 2003 in Oregon Army Guard builds House of Hope for Iraqis in Mosul By 1st Lt. Emil Buzaid Public Affairs Rep, 52nd Engineer Battalion Mosul, Iraq Ã¯Â¿Â½ There is a house in the city of Mosul, Iraq that represents great possibilities for the future of this war-torn country.
It is a tiny house by American standards, but the House of Hope is only the beginning of a much more ambitious project.
This house is unique in that it is the first one built with the combined efforts of US soldiers and Iraqi workers.
The primary intent of this project is to train former members of the Iraqi military in basic block masonry construction.
A secondary benefit of the project is that it will eventually provide places to live for displaced families in the city of Mosul.
In Phase one of a three-phase operation, which was completed in mid-August, a platoon of US Army engineers moved in and began construction of a single prototype house.
In an environment such as exists in Mosul, sometimes just getting around in the city can be difficult and dangerous, so building this one house presented a significant challenge to the soldiers who got the task.
First platoon, B/52 Engineers is used to dealing with challenges.
As part of a tri-component engineer battalion, the soldiers in the platoon have become accustomed to adapting to the differences between the active duty, guard, and reserve elements of the unit.
Most of the soldiers in first platoon are members of the Oregon National Guard, who got the call in February and less than a week later found themselves at Fort Carson, Co.
There they not only had to deal with the icy cold Colorado winter and the high altitude, but also the adjustment from their normal lives to the full-time Army.
On top of that, the platoon took on five soldiers from the active component of the battalion, including a brand-new platoon leader just three months out of the officer Ã¯Â¿Â½s basic course.
Oregon governor, Ted Kulongoski, who attended the ceremony emphasized that the National Guard is no longer comprised of Ã¯Â¿Â½weekend warriorsÃ¯Â¿Â½.
Ã¯Â¿Â½I have to admit that when I got out of the Marines many years ago, even I thought of the National Guard this way.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Kulongoski said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½But not any more.
I learned long ago what most of the country is now starting to understand Ã¯Â¿Â½ you are soldiers who also happen to have civilian jobs.
You go into harms way, and are critical to the war on terror.
You are no longer a stepchild to the military, if you ever were.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maj. Dan Hendrickson of Corvallis, commander of the 2-162 thanked the 41st Brigade, State Command See Mobilization, page 8 Brig. Gen. Raymond C. Byrne named as acting Adjutant General By Kay F. Fristad, State Public Affairs Office At the request of Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, Brig. Gen. Raymond C. Byrne, Jr. was appointed to the position of Acting Adjutant General of the Oregon National Guard on October 20, 2003.
Byrne, who relinquished command of the 41st Separate Infantry Brigade to Col. (P) Douglas A. Pritt on October 18, 2003, will serve in the acting AG post while Kulongoski conducts a survey of candidates eligible for final appointment to the position.
Byrne was born in Missoula, Montana, and graduated from high school in Butte, Montana.
He graduated from the University of Oregon in 1970 with a bachelor of science in anthropology and again in 1983, with a master of science in curriculum and instruction.
He was commissioned a second lieutenant from Officer Candidate School in January 1972.
As a traditional guardsman, Byrne was a middle school teacher for more than 25 years prior to accepting the fulltime position as commander of the 41st Brigade.
Stepping down after more than 38 years of service the military, Maj. Gen. Alexander H. Burgin will seek civilian employment.
Ã¯Â¿Â½I am not getting any younger, and if I am to market my skills in the civilian marketplace, the time is now,Ã¯Â¿Â½ stated Burgin at a press conference held at the Military Headquarters building in Salem, Ore.
Burgin and Kulongoski first discussed his stepping down in March 2003, but due to the current military operations tempo, and the National GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s overseas deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq, the decision was delayed.
However, in recognizing that the tempo will not slow down in the Photo by Kay Fristad, State Public Affairs Office foreseeable future, Kulongoski appointed Byrne as an Brig. Gen. Raymond C. Byrne, Jr. has a focus on family and family support programs during interim TAG. his tenure as acting adjutant general.

Maj. Gen. Robert Wilson, 7 th Infantry Division Commanding General.
Pritt said he was grateful and excited to fill the position, adding that his vision for the 41st was for it to be the best Infantry Brigade in the Army National Guard.
Pritt says that people are the most important asset of the National Guard.
His goal is to encourage an environment where people enjoy coming to work, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, and individual successes are celebrated.
The 41st Brigade consists of the 1-162 IN, 2-162 IN, 1-186 IN, 2-218 FA, and the 41st Provisional Battalion.
About 60 percent of the unit is either currently serving as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, or is preparing to deploy in support of that mission.

Address your comments, feedback and ideas to: The Oregon Sentinel Attn: Editor c/o State Public Affairs Office P.O. Box 14350 Salem, OR 97309 arnold.v.strong@mil.state.or.us Your Letters A Letter of Thanks I write to you to give praise and thanks to a team of men under your command who saved my life.
On Monday October 6th, I was rescued from a 13,000-foot mountain ledge in a litter hoisted up to a CH-47 helicopter from your base.
The Inyo County Sheriff told me that Dave Long was the pilot and Doug Walker was the copilot.
There were four other crewmembers.
The spot that Search and Rescue chose to put my litter for pick up was on a steep mountainside, surrounded by rocky crags.
The cable on the hoist of the CH-47 was 150-feet long.
The mountain sloped upward at about 45degrees.
The pilot had to keep inching lower and closer to the mountains because the rotor wash against the mountain was blowing the cable away from the rescuer trying to grab it! On their third approach he grabbed the cable and secured it to my litter.
Soon I was on my way up toward the hatch of the Chinook.
Tears of gratitude filled my goggles as I lay inside the noisy helicopter.
Once we landed in Bishop, Calif., I was merely able to say a brief thank you and shake a few hands.
This is woefully inadequate as thanks for men who put it all on the line for me that day.
The rotor clearance looked to be less than 50 feet! That the Army National Guard would send so much equipment and man power so far to the aid of one person fills me with pride for our nation and our military.
Please give each of those six flight crewmembers appropriate commendations for bravery and dedication.
I consider their efforts heroic! I believe I owe them my life! Sincerely and thankfully yours, John D. Millane, MD Yes, these guys are our true heroes.

Good advice from soliders on the ground in Iraq Greetings from Iraq, A year is a long time.
We are moving in on our first full year.
I would like to take you all through our path that put us here at Logistics Support Group Anaconda.
When the unit was called together during our exercise in Japan, we all knew what the news would be we were activated for Iraq.
The unit was now going to war, with another Corps.
The activation date was a week after we returned from the exercise.
That is how our deployment started.
I jumped into working on predeployment planning the day after we returned.
This situation went as well as it could, many questions were still left unanswered as we left for our Mobilization Site at Fort Lewis Washington.
The main one for me was why we were leaving for war without the best equipment the state had to give us, like the new body armor like other units have at home station.
The unit still moved forward ready to go wherever they were told.
During our time at Ft. Lewis, our unit was one of the lucky ones.
We had a "Daddy Corps" looking out for us, like they always do when we are told no from other sources.
We are their Rear Operations Center (ROC).
They gave us everything we needed, except the new body armor.
We thought we were on a short time line to get here, and were told every week for the first four weeks that we could be leaving at any time, but we ended up being here much longer.
This situation never came to be since the US forces never entered Turkey.
Our time at Ft. Lewis was well-spent.
Our unit was one of the lucky ones.
I assisted our unit in receiving classes and training in many different areas like Hazardous Materials Handling (HAZMAT), Field Sanitation, PLDC and many different specialized computer classes.
The time went slow and the information flow from CENTCOM was not quick, since our initial reason for being deployed didn't really exist anymore, and we were like many other units who were mobilized.
Then the call came and our ADVON was launched to Kuwait.
The rest of the unit followed and we worked in a unit thrown together under V Corps called V Corps Kuwait.
It was another headquarters, nothing the 82 ROC had been trained to do, but we did it.
We stayed with this mission for two months.
We then moved to Iraq.
We again were given a mission we have not been trained or equipped for as the Base Command for LSA Anaconda.
We are the City Administrators for a city about the size of Woodburn Oregon.
The place was a wreck when we arrived.
The first concern was improving security, and we have helped to give this base some direction for the future a task that has proved more difficult than it might sound.
We are developing a master plan for this base, and it really has become a moving target.
It seems that every day the plans are changed by the `powers that be', and a new unit moves in, creating new functions for the base.
We will continue on our original mission for the rest of the time we are in Theater.
The overall moral and feelings of the unit is good.
We have our ups and downs like every unit who deploys.
The unit has now been gone from Oregon since February.
My advice to every one of the units who deploy is to remember your soldiers, and watch your people... get to know your people.
Every soldier will have problems before their deployment ends.
Some issues will be worse than others.
This is something that leaders and battle buddies need to remember.
Soldiers are people too, and they have issues both inside and outside the military.
Friends of mine have asked me if there is something they can do to get r eady to deploy.
The advice I would give them is to get your military and personal records ready to go and keep them up to date.
This is so you don't have to spend time dealing with issues before you leave, and spend time with your family, which is really the most important thing.
Like everyone else, I am waiting for the day when I can go home and be with my family.
Maj. Scott Farish, Military Police, 82 ROC, Logistics Support Group, Anaconda, Iraq We here i n Oregon definitely haven't forgotten about you guys.

As a former Marine and Commander in Chief of the Oregon National Guard, I understand the sacrifice you are making and the patriotic duty you are fulfilling.
I take great pride in telling you that, through your shining example, I see a great future for this state.
Our future has never been brighter because the men and women of the Oregon National Guard have never been better.
As you serve in Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, know that we here at home are doing our best to serve and support your families, your friends and your communities in your absence.
The people of Oregon will not rest completely until you are back in the arms of your loved ones - and have returned to your traditional jobs and professions that are so vital to our economy.
Remain vigilant in executing your mission and in supporting your fellow service members.
Along with your families, I will await your safe return knowing that you are standing up for your country while your country, your state, and your communities are standing up and praying for you.
Thank you for your service.
Most Sincerely, Your Fellow Veteran, Ted Kulongoski General Raymond C. Byrne, Acting Adjutant General, State of Oregon Since becoming the Acting Adjutant General of the Oregon National Guard, I have had the opportunity to tour across the state to meet with our soldiers and airmen, their families and communities.
After meeting with all of these people, it became apparent that we need to do more to reach out to our collective National Guard family.
The Oregon National Guard has approximately 2,500 members deployed on Active Federal Service as part of the Global War on Terrorism.
If you multiply that number by four (the number of spouses, dependents, or parents) you get 10,000 people who are dependent on us for some form of care, assistance, or information.
Our number one priority in the Oregon National Guard is to support our deployed members and their families.
I ask all of you as leaders and members of this community to prioritize your daily work load in order to ensure that family and guard member issues are taken care of.
Please follow through on your work and see to it that it is completed to the best of your ability.
Share information with family program members and the chain of command so that they are aware of important developments and have the information they need to complete their jobs effectively and on time.
Our goal as an organization is to make sure that we retain our membersÃ¯Â¿Â½ and their familiesÃ¯Â¿Â½ loyalty and trust.
We can only accomplish this by ensuring that we are meeting their needs while maintaining the best trained and resourced soldiers and airmen.
LetÃ¯Â¿Â½s do our best to help those in need before those needs become issues.
It would be a shame for any soldier or airman to leave our organization because we failed to take care of them or their family.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Chief Master Sergeant J. Wayne Stuart, State Command Chief Just the other week, the Oregon National Guard participated in the Albany VeteranÃ¯Â¿Â½s Day parade, which has historicallyl been the largest commemoration of VeteranÃ¯Â¿Â½s Day West of the Mississippi.
But this year, the review held special meaning for me.
Of course, I was proud to have been part of the official party and was glad to see the crowds out there remembering our troops and veterans.
But this year with so many of our own ranks deployed across the world and so many of our members involved in one way or another in fighting the Global War on Terrorism, I was especially touched.
As I looked at U.S. Air Force Master Ser geant (Ret.)
Norm Walters and his wife, Arlene, honored this year as a Gold Star Mother for the loss of their son, Sgt.
Donald Walters, Jr., in Operation Iraqi Freedom, I was amazed at the personal dignity of this veteran who lost even more than his own life, he had lost his first-born son.
He and his wife stood there as part of the official party next to our Governor and Adjutant General, pleased to be a part of the event, proud to honor their son.
Beside them stood the Grand Marshals of this yearÃ¯Â¿Â½s parade, former Prisoners of War who had suffered more than any of us at the hands of the enemy, standing proud of their service and their Nation.
Seeing these patriots reminded me of the valiant profession of arms that we all serve, whether as traditional status Guard members, family members, or veterans.
As the 116th Air Control Squadron has recently returned from just under two Command Sergeant Major Donald F. Newman, State Command Sergeant Major Be a Change Agent There is a lot of talk these days about being an agent for change and in the Oregon National Guard that term has a lot of relevance.
Things have changed at the State Headquarters tremendously in the past few months but change is good.
We are now a Joint Force Headquarters, integrating both Army and Air components into one ready, reliable and relevant command group for the o r ganization.
We have also had a change in senior leadership.
Brig. Gen. Byrne was appointed as the acting Adjutant General last month while the Governor conducts his interviews for a new Adjutant General.
General Byrne has focused the entire organization in the right direction as his words above attest to.
We know that we must better serve the family members and communities of deployed citizen soldiers and airmen and are doing our best to do just that.
The focus here at the top has been to continue resource the training, recruiting, retaining and maintaining the force for State and Federal contingencies, but for those units currently mobilized (and thus not under our direct control) we have turned our heads toward the support of families and friends of those of us away from Oregon.
I challenge all of you in the Oregon National Guard to be an agent for change.
In order to take the best care of the organizations within the guard, we need to hear from you how to best serve years of active duty in support of the Operation Noble Eagle, the 142 nd Fighter Wing continues to perform aerial patrols over the skies of the Northwest.
As the 173rd Wing continues to upgrade the F-15 fleet, the 101st COG trains to build secure air base operations and communications.
We are a reliable, relevant and ready force, prepared to deploy within 48 hours around the world.
We continue to see the results of our work every day in a more safe and secure homeland and in a better trained and resourced force.
Touring the parade this year, meeting those who came before us and remembering those with whom we currently serve, I was reminded that someday our men and women will be known as the greatest of their generation, just as veterans of World War II were so named before them.
It is an honor to remember our veterans and to give thanks for those who stand guard at freedomÃ¯Â¿Â½s gate.
Thanks for your service and for remembering your predecessors.
your organizationÃ¯Â¿Â½s needs.
But we also need your action.
In raising concerns about your deployed citizen soldiers, offer us your solution as well.
This is not a pep talk or shirking of responsibility but a direct and serious challenge.
We need to know the issues that you face and I urge you to contact your chain of command and to use the NCO chain of support to address the challenges you face.
Without knowing the issues you are facing, we cannot be of any help.
It will be Thanksgiving as this monthÃ¯Â¿Â½s edition reaches you and while there is much to look forward to (the return of loved ones on the top of everyoneÃ¯Â¿Â½s list), I hope all of us can be thankful for the blessings and good we each receive every day.
We are making a difference abroad and we are making a difference at home.
The quality of that difference will be determined by the changes each of us is ready to implement in our own lives.
So be a change agent, propose a solution and help us to strengthen this great organization even more.
Give thanks for change.
Winter 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 4 Can I "burr o" this? 52nd Engineer Battalion rebuilds communites The 52nd Engineer Battalion is making solid progress with its projects in Mosul and the greater Ninewa province.
As week 18 draws to a close, the battalion finds itself thoroughly engaged in several key construction missions.
While some of these missions are still intended for the use of the local Iraqis, the focus is on the very monumental task of building a semi-permanent basecamp on Mosul Airfield.
Company A is in char ge of the airfieldÃ¯Â¿Â½s basecamp construction effort.
Over the past week, theyÃ¯Â¿Â½ve placed over 30 concrete foundations for what will eventually be wooden huts used for troop lodging.
Over the next week, they will continue to build foundations as they wait for the materials for the wooden huts to arrive.
Last Saturday, Company B had a ribbon-cutting ceremony for its newly renovated boysÃ¯Â¿Â½ and girlsÃ¯Â¿Â½ orphanages.
While they are waiting for the ribbon cutting at the first House of Hope, theyÃ¯Â¿Â½ve already started to build the foundation for the next iteration.
On another note, B-companyÃ¯Â¿Â½s earthmovers are still building roads in the Bardiyah area that will enable the locals to better travel from village to village.
Company C is still located at the Qayarra Airfield and is doing excellent work for that installation.
Over the next week, they are planning to work on an internet cafÃ¯Â¿Â½, recreation center, and the airfieldÃ¯Â¿Â½s front gate.
C-company has also executed two emergency firefighting missions in the last week.
Both times, oil-related facilities were set ablaze and C-company was able to respond and put them out quickly, thus preventing tremendous levels of damage and loss.

Lt. Emile Buzaid 52nd Engineer Battalion Graffiti, now known as Tom Sawyer.
They only go out a couple times a week, inspect and document the painting and removal of graffiti.
This has allowed 2nd to take on additional missions like constructing a Headquarters building on Logistics Support Group Diamondback.
Third Platoon has completed the North Road project and was back in the base camp for a short while before they were sent off to assist the 37EN in the expansion of Hawler airfield.
Also has been tasked with some road repair/ improvement around camp and improving dirt berms for a field artillery unit that is used as protection from the multiple attacks they have received.
Maintenance has been maintaining their edge on preventive maintenance and services, and Headquarters continues to do a superb job in managing all the missions that come our way.
Some of you may not be aware of how integrated we have become with the active duty.
We have ten active duty soldiers that have been added to our numbers; Lt. Hop, Lt. Perdue, Sgt. Valadez, Sgt. Gordon, Sgt. Schultz, Sgt. Watson, Spec.

Capt. Marcus Allen Williams, 52nd Engineer Battalion Private 1st Class Nathan William Nakis shares a moment of respite with boys from the newly-built "House of Hope" orphanage in Mosul (see below).
Nakis is currently serving with the Bravo Company 52nd Engineer Battalion in Mosul, Iraq.
We had an excellent relationship with the 10th MTN Battalion.
It was like it should be; great cross talk on FM; keeping each unit informed.
The company up north did a great job Ã¯Â¿Â½ the area we moved into was the hottest area on the main supply route (MSR) from Kuwait to Iraq.
Once we occupied the area there were no enemy-initiated attacks on collation convoys moving on the MSR.
They would attack north or south of our area but the attacks were greatly reduced from prior to our being here.
The pucker factor does go up when you get stuck in traffic and canÃ¯Â¿Â½t move if needed.
One of the techniques they are using is throwing hand grenades at vehicles, this happened to the MPs living with us.
The area up there is still hot, the 10th MTN lost two soldiers and an interpreter yesterday.
The biggest threat is improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.
Both the MPs in our area of interest as well as the 10th MTN had causalities and deaths due to IEDs.
The camp where we were living was mortared around the beginning of September.
I rolled out of the rack put on my body armor and tried to make sense of the chaos.
Only one MP was hurt, shrapnel down one side of his body.
I got to see the ruins at Babylon, so this turned into the religious tour with the ruins at Ur. Running log packs through the Baghdad area, we saw the palaces and the airport, went up to the Corps support area north of the city.
It is interesting to be driving along and run right into two M-1 tanks in an intersection conducting a check point.
The local population is waving at us, which they did not do right after we arrived.
They also gave us some human intelligence which led us finding some large weapon and UXO (unexploded ordinance) caches.
And yes, we have been extended to 365 days boots on the ground, so it makes our entire deployment 16-17 months on active duty.

Not everyone will get it, but the battalion will be close.
Hope everything is going well for everyone back home.

Attacks by Sadam loyalists don't deter spirit, focus We moved to the REMF area of Kuwait, the BN has moved to Camp Arifjan.
The resources here are leaps and bounds above KNB and Iraq.
I actually saw and used my first flush toilet in six months, no more porta-potties or wooden shacks (with the burn barrels) in the middle of camp where everyone can see your boots.
Hot water too! This is like the Ritz of Kuwait.
I can honestly say I will never drink bottled water again.
The temperature has been around 100 to 110 until this week.
At night itÃ¯Â¿Â½s getting down to 65 and it seems like itÃ¯Â¿Â½s 40 degrees.
Our battalion was operating 25 miles south of Baghdad 5 km east of Haswah.
Some of our adjacent units were a battalion from the 10th MTN, the Polish Division, and one from 3/82nd ABN.
We're all one Army, says General Five months have now passed since we arrived in the theater of operations.
We are all thankful that everyone involved in the ambush will recover.
The physical scars will take less time then the emotional ones.
Sgt. Dooley and Spec.
Lillibridge are both on their way to Germany and then to the states to recover.

Wynia and Spec.
Lyman have also gone back for medical treatment.
We all wish them a quick and complete recovery.
First Platoon is continuing with instructing the former Iraqi soldiers on construction methods, now phase II of the House of Hope / Village of Hope is well on its way.
They have gone from constructing a single dwelling to constructing a Four-Plex.
Since the mission has changed from construction to instruction, the Platoon has taken on additional projects; 20 concrete tent pads for the replacement center, and maintenance pads for HSC. Second Platoon has moved out from a direct involvement with Task Force Performing this mission required the ROC to task organize from its current S2/G3 sections into a S1, S2, S3, S4 and Special Projects organization.
In addition, we have Operational Control (OPCON)of a National Guard Rear Area Operations Center (RAOC), National Guard MP Law and Order Detachment, National Guard Infantry Company and a United States Army Reserve (USAR) Facilities Engineering Team (FET).
I hope this helps describe what we are doing.

Winter 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 5 Brig.Gen.
Rosenbaum (Ret.) honored for his accomplishments By Spec.
Luke Elliott Public Affairs Rep, 115th MPAD A strange and compelling flow of military drumbeats filled the ears of nearly 150 listeners in a ballroom at the Multnomah Athletic Club in downtown Portland on Sept. 19.
The ceremonyÃ¯Â¿Â½s effects on the crowd were apparent, stirring patriotic and admiring emotions in the faces of the crowd, a mix of civilians and airmen, in their mess dress uniforms.
On this day, Brig. Gen. Fred M. Rosenbaum (retired) was inducted into the honorary Order of the Minuteman society by the enlisted personnel of the Oregon Air Guard for his outstanding leadership, citizenship and philanthropic contributions to military members and their families, as well as to the people of communities throughout Oregon.
Throughout his over 40 years of military service, Rosenbaum carried out and expanded Oregon Air Guard missions, while invoking positive changes in the organizational culture, and finding new opportunities for Oregon Air Guard members and their families.
RosenbaumÃ¯Â¿Â½s accomplishments were listed in his nomination letter in four categories; the development of a highly successful community service program called Camp Rosenbaum, the acquisition of the 173rd Fighter Wing, involvement in the Employer Support of the Guard/ Reserve program (ESGR) at the state and national levels, and numerous improvements in personnel programs including recruiting, promotions and minority opportunities, to name a few.
In 1970, Rosenbaum went to bat for under-privileged youths by utilizing military resources at Camp Rilea as a one-week Summer camp for kids.
This camp was originally called Ã¯Â¿Â½Hap Camp,Ã¯Â¿Â½ which later was renamed by Oregon Gov. Victor Atiyeh as Ã¯Â¿Â½Camp RosenbaumÃ¯Â¿Â½ for the campÃ¯Â¿Â½s namesake, and his devotion to the program.
Attendance in the camp has increased through the years and has become a part of thousands of Oregon childrenÃ¯Â¿Â½s lives.
The camp has become widely known as the Oregon Air GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s largest community service project.
While continuing to work on Ã¯Â¿Â½Hap Camp,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Rosenbaum also served as one of eight members of the Oregon Military Council, which was directly headed by the state governor, from 1977 to 1986.
Through this council, he provided military guidance and leadership to three Oregon governors.
His work on the council helped to communicate and inform key public and political officials on military matters such as emergency operations and disaster relief planning.
RosenbaumÃ¯Â¿Â½s role helped to foster good communications and relations with key political parties, which proved to be very advantageous to the Oregon Air Guard.
Throughout RosenbaumÃ¯Â¿Â½s first few years of service as the Oregon Air Guard commander, he worked to expand the ORANGÃ¯Â¿Â½s operational missions by obtaining funding and approval from the Department of Defense to establish a fighter training school at Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Ore., which began in February 1983.
The school currently is one of two training sites in the country for Air Force and Air National Guard F15 pilots.
Rosenbaum brought national claim and recognition to the Oregon Air Guard, as well as created hundreds of jobs for OregonÃ¯Â¿Â½s enlisted and officer corps.
More than 700 Guard members now work at Kingsley Field.
Rosenbaum also spearheaded another project for OregonÃ¯Â¿Â½s airmen called Ã¯Â¿Â½The Guard Takes Care of Its Own.Ã¯Â¿Â½ This humanitarian-based program, developed by Rosenbaum while serving as commander of the Oregon Air Guard, helped Guard members with civilian job placements, affordable mortgages and loans, low cost insurance plans and discount buying services.
As a commitment to further improving affordable insurance opportunities for airmen, Rosenbaum served as chairman, and later, trustee of the Insurance Trust Committee for the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS) from 1985 to 1990.
During this time, he aided in the development and sale of low-cost life insurance policies to thousands of interested airmen and soldiers in the National Guard.
The money received through this insurance sales program was then used to increase lobbying efforts to further support Photo by Tech Sgt.

Donna Prigmore, Public Affairs Officer, HQ, ORANG The Oregon Air National GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s newest unit, the 101 st Combat Operations Group, held their first joint exercise, Ã¯Â¿Â½Operation FireflyÃ¯Â¿Â½, October 31 Ã¯Â¿Â½ November 9, 2003 in Hurlong, Calif.
The weeklong exercise Ã¯Â¿Â½ which included approximately 40 personnel Ã¯Â¿Â½ was held at the Sierra Army Depot, testing the groupÃ¯Â¿Â½s ability to seize an airfield in a high enemy threat area and set up basic airfield operations and communication systems.
Members from the 270th Air Traffic Control Squadron, 244 th Combat Communications Squadron, 272 nd Combat Communications Squadron, and 123rd Weather Flight participated directly in the exercise.
Six members from the 116th Air Control Squadron were also on hand to observe how their long-range air surveillance radar might be set-up and used in the next training exercise scheduled for May 2004.
As part of the training event, members from the ORANG set-up a complex airfield network involving a tactical air traffic control tower, a sophisticated communication platform, and weather equipment for data reception and observation purposes.
According to Lt. Col. Garrick Schroeder, the detachment commander for the 272nd CBCS, the unit set-up their tactical satellite van (AN/TSC 93B) and a 20-foot antenna in Klamath Falls, Ore., home of the 173rd Fighter Wing and 270th ATCS, and were able to extend the telephone and Internet capabilities from that location to the exercise site in Hurlong, Calif.
Once the satellite framework was laid, the 244th CBCS crews at the exercise site took over.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We interfaced with the 272nd CBCS satellite signal and installed computer circuits (Internet) and phones [both secure and non-secure] for the endusers,Ã¯Â¿Â½ explained Capt. Frank Page, the forward 101 st COG detachment commander.
Air operations, many involving blackout conditions at night, commenced once the communications system, weather equipment and tactical air traffic control tower were in place.
Equipped with night vision goggles, controllers from the 270th ATCS directed air operations (i.e., takeoffs, landings and flight paths) for C-130s Photo by Tech.

Ã¯Â¿Â½The members of the 101st COG did an outstanding job maximizing their training opportunities and building rapport among their diverse units,Ã¯Â¿Â½ says Lt. Col. Mike Labounty, deputy commander of the 101st COG.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We have to work closely and train as a team because we deploy to dangerous areas.Ã¯Â¿Â½ explained Labounty.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Once special operations personnel secure the landing zone, itÃ¯Â¿Â½s our job to set-up air base operations and get the aircraft on and off the airfield.
Trust and teamwork are critical to the process.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Winter 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 6 641st Medical Battalion (Evacuation) provides valuable `back-fill' for deployed units By Spec.
Jessica J. Cosner Public Affairs Office, Ft. Bragg HQ, 18th Airborne Corps Ft. Bragg, N.C.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ In times of need, the Army calls on its reserve counterparts to continue the mission in garrison for deployed active-duty units.
The 641st Medical Evacuation Battalion from McNary Airfield in Salem, Ore., has taken over the 56th Medical Battalion in Ft. Bragg, N.C. by assuming their mission at Simmons Army Airfield while they are deployed.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ WeÃ¯Â¿Â½ve just been here a couple of weeks.
They (56th Medical Battalion.) are deployed (to the Central Command Area of Operations) so we are backfilling for them,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Lt. Col. David A. Greenwood, 641st battalion commander.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We do the same thing they do.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Filling the 56th Medical BattalionÃ¯Â¿Â½s shoes can be a difficult task to accomplish with fewer personnel and equipment shortages.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Our primary mission is to run the (medical evacuation) for Fort Bragg, Fort Stewart, Fort Cambell, Fort Knox, Eglin Air Force Base and Ranger Camp (Dahlonaga, Ga.),Ã¯Â¿Â½ Greenwood said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½So at these installations we have pieces out there, with helicopters on 24-hour standby in case there is some sort of training accident.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The 812th Medical Company, from Esler Field, Alexandria, La., which is one of the 641st Medical BattalionÃ¯Â¿Â½s companies, replaced three companies here with one third the aircraft and one ninth the personnel, according to Staff Sgt. Michael R. Gray Jr., a crew chief with the 812th Med Co.
However, this hasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t hindered their performance, skill or capability.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Since weÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been activated in January, we have flown 1,270 hours and approximately 30 missions,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Staff Sgt. Matthew S. Harmon, 812th flight medic.
Due to the nature of their mission, the 641st maintains qualified pilots as well as medical technicians.
Ã¯Â¿Â½This type of unit normally will have air ambulance units, which are the helicopters (that) provide MEDEVAC support for the various installations, and (we) also have ground ambulance companies,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Greenwood said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½All the people in this unit get some medical training and some aviation training.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Even though aviators are essential to the missionÃ¯Â¿Â½s success, the 641st focuses on medically treating and transporting soldiers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s all about the medical aspect.
The helicopter is just a conveyance to get the patients to the hospital, and that is where we fit in,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Greenwood said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We have folks that are experts on aircraft maintenance, safety, tactical operations ... just to provide assistance to units.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The flight crew consists of two pilots, one crew chief and one flight medic, however they function as a team to accomplish their objective.
Ã¯Â¿Â½EveryoneÃ¯Â¿Â½s job is centered around getting a patient from point A to point B in the fastest time possible, not necessarily treating him, but getting him stabilized, packaged and brought to a place of higher critical care than what we can provide,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Gray said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We are no more important than anyone else.
We are four people, but we act as one crew.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Flight medics are trained to stabilize a patient and a crew chief aids the medic and tends to the needs of the aircraft.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We train with (medics), but we arenÃ¯Â¿Â½t qualified medics; we can assist in various ways,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Gray continued.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Our task is primarily in the event that the aircraft has a malfunction, we diagnose the malfunction and repair it as need be.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Each helicopter, UH-1 or UH-60Q, is equipped to accomplish the mission efficiently.
Ã¯Â¿Â½It is a MEDEVA C configured aircraft,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Harmon said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We c a n carry three litter patients or four ambulatory patients, a crew chief and flight medic.
(The aircraft) has a rescue hoist, so we are able to do extractions on the hoist from altitudes and areas where we canÃ¯Â¿Â½t land a helicopter.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The pilots are essential to the overall mission, and remain trained and ready for flight at a moments notice along with their three other crew members.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ We were notified and then expected to be here four days later.
There was no time to train,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Greenwood said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½When we got here we (were) a fully trained unit.
We are ready to go.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Even though the 641st is a part time unit, many of its soldiersÃ¯Â¿Â½ civilian jobs parallel their military occupation specialty to further enhance their skill level.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Almost all our medics are paramedics at fire departments,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Greenwood said.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ We can provide a higher level of care than many military medics, because of our civilian credentials,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Harmon said.
Greenwood feels his unit is now an essential part of the active Army.
Ã¯Â¿Â½In theory, (according to) the Ã¯Â¿Â½Army of OneÃ¯Â¿Â½ slogan, once you get to an installation there should be few differences,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Greenwood said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½That is what we are trying to demonstrate; come in here and maintain the standard.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Oregon Guardsman injured in Iraq returns home to warm welcome potable water to local Iraqis.
He was hit by two rounds, suffering injuries to the knee and thigh.
Dooley recounted a succession of adventures that began last February after he transferred into B-52 then reported to Fort Carson, along with the rest of the company, prior to deploying to Iraq by way of Kuwait.
While in Kuwait, Dooley and the other soldiers of B-52 unloaded their equipment and were in-processed.
After arriving in Iraq, DooleyÃ¯Â¿Â½s unit was stationed at the Mosul Air Base.
While conditions at the airbase steadily improved, the temperatures soared.
Ã¯Â¿Â½When I left (Mosul) the chow hall had been air conditioned.
There was a MWR place where we could send emailÃ¯Â¿Â½Every day it was still hitting above 110-degrees F,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Dooley.
According to Dooley, the company was immediately tasked with numerous missions as soon as it arrived in Mosul, Iraq.
He and other members of B-52 helped with road improvements and repairs.
Dooley described how he worked alongside Iraqi fire fighters for five days in July.
Dooley and other Oregon Guardmembers worked fourhour shifts battling a large sulfur fire, in 130-degree heat, all the while wearing protective masks.
According to investigators, the fire was started by Saddam loyalists.
Dooley said the region surrounding Mosul is surrounded by small villages, sheep herders and wheat farms.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The people in the villages gave us water, watermelons, and teaÃ¯Â¿Â½they were friendly,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dooley said.
He felt that in spite of the wounds he sustained, serving in Iraq with B-52 was a worthwhile experience.
According to Lt. Col. William J. Schutz, commander of the 1249 th Engineer Battalion, Dooley and the other members of the battalion who were transferred to B-52 when it was mobilized are ready to face any challenge in Iraq.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We are proud of all the soldiers we transferred over.Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Schutz.
Ã¯Â¿Â½We are sure that the skills they have learned and performed at the 1249th Engineer Battalion have prepared them well for the missions they are accomplishing in Iraq.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dooley, a resident of Bend, Ore., has begun physical therapy since returning to the United States.
He is looking forward to a quick recovery and a return to the Mt. Bachelor Ski Resort where he is a member of its receiving department.
Ã¯Â¿Â½My boss, John Petrich, has been very supportive from the very start of the mobilization,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dooley said.
For his combat wounds, Dooley was awarded the Purple Heart.

Aside from Long, the crew consisted of Instructor Pilot, CW3 Doug Walker, First Sergeant and Flight Engineer, Spec. 1st Class Scott McCoy, Standardization Flight Engineer Instructor Sgt. Todd Albertson, Flight Engineer Instructor Sgt.
Andy Rhoden, and Spec.
Adrian Stump as the Crew Chief.
The helicopter and crew arrived in Bishop, California after a 3.5-hour, 575-mile, non-stop flight.
They were met by Sgt. Randy Nixon of the Inyo County Sheriff 's Depar tment, and a Search and Rescue (SAR) Coordinator for a briefing of the situation.
According to the SAR Coordinator, a hiker had fallen about 100 feet while climbing on Split Mountain in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
The injured man, a doctor from Long Beach, California, had suffered a broken ankle, broken fibula, broken wrist, and a laceration to the right forearm.
His climbing partner had to leave him overnight with only a fleece jacket, while he went for help.
An Inyo County SAR team was already with the injured hiker, having arrived on scene Sunday, and awaited a more powerful helicopter to airlift the hiker off the mountain.
The Chinook departed Bishop for the 22.5-mile flight to Split Mountain.
This rescue wasn't going to be an easy one.
The hoist cable on the CH-47D helicopter wasn't long enough to drop straight down to the injured climber, and the ledge on which the patient and his rescuers were perched was so narrow the helicopter couldn't get very close to the cliff.
One of the rescuers had to climb out on the ledge while the helicopter maneuvered as close as possible.
The Flight Engineer then swung the hoist cable back and forth so the rescuer on the ledge could grab onto it, and attach it to the basket.
Then the basket had to be pulled toward the helicopter at an angle, as the rescuers on the ledge helped to stabilize the basket and keep it from swinging while being winched upward.
After the injured doctor was secured in the helicopter, it descended from the mountain and returned to Bishop where the patient was transferred to a waiting ambulance.
After refueling, the helicopter returned to Split Mountain to recover the SAR team and their gear.
Since there was no place for the Chinook to land, the helicopter crew had to hoist each of the seven-man SAR team and their two loads of gear individually.
Even while the crew was wrapping up their mission, Nixon learned of another overdue climber.
But after some quick investigation by the SAR team, the second climber was found to be safe.
During the debriefing by the California Sheriff 's Department, the team determined that it would have taken a ground rescue seven days, and nearly 100 people to accomplish what the Chinook did in a few hours.
After a good night's rest the Chinook Helicopter crew returned to Pendleton, Ore., knowing they had accomplished something out of the ordinary.

Sgt.
Homer Walden in front of some of the equipment he utilizes in his role as weapons controller for the 116th Air Control Squadron.
By Maj. Donna Prigmore, Public Affairs Officer, HQ, ORANG Tech Sgt.
Homer Walden, a weapons controller in the Oregon Air GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s 116th Air Control Squadron in Warrenton, made history this past summer when he became the first Air National Guard enlisted weapons director to graduate from Advanced Weapons Director School.
The six-month long school Ã¯Â¿Â½ held at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada Ã¯Â¿Â½ was established in 2000 for enlisted weapons directors with at least three years of experience and an in-depth knowledge of air control operations.
The intent of the curriculum is to give seasoned active duty and Guard airmen and women an opportunity to train (at an advanced level) in a high stress, simulated wartime environment with multiple airframes flying actual combat-style missions.
Weapons directors, whether conducting real-world missions or training, communicate closely with fighter pilots in the sky to help them identify enemies and determine when and where to launch missile strikes.
The directors (also referred to as controllers) use tactical radar units, scopes, and communication modules to scan large airspace for immediate threats to security and take action to eliminate them.
Walden, a ground-based weapons controller with more than eight years of air control experience, served as the class leader for AWDS Class 03-1.
He graduated, along with a handful of active duty students, on June 13, 2003 to become the first weapons director in the ANG to attend the course.
Due to the complexity of the mission, each class is made up of only six students, with a 50/50 split between ground and air-based controllers.
Across the U.S., there are approximately 500 controllers, 300 of which scan the skies using groundbased equipment.
The other 200 operate as controllers in the sky while flying on board Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft.
According to Walden, the AWDS curriculum was developed, in part, from programs and syllabi already in place at the Fighter Weapons School (FWS), which is also conducted at Nellis AFB.
The FWS operates a rigorous training program for aeronautically-rated officers who pass a difficult screening process and are selected to become weapons officers.
The officer-based FWS and the enlisted-based AWDS are held concurrently in order to maximize training among and between pilots and weapons controllers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The staff at the (AWDS) schoolhouse use a building block approach by starting with small (combat) missions before introducing larger and larger ones,Ã¯Â¿Â½ explained Walden.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s a very challenging course that requires a lot of experience.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Before the enlisted students are exposed to combat missions however, they are instructed on operational details of each aircraft in the Air Force inventory, including all bombers, fighters, refuelers, and NATO aircraft.
According to Walden, knowing the different types of aircraft and their capabilities is important because of the partnership they have with fighter pilots in the air.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We control combat aircraft when they are performing their combat mission, whether it be air-to-air combat, combat air patrols, close-air support, or air-to-air refueling.
ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s a tough part of the curriculum but itÃ¯Â¿Â½s definitely needed.Ã¯Â¿Â½ According to Tech.
Sgt. James Peters, NCOIC of standards and evaluations at AWDS, enlisted personnel were barred from serving as weapons directors up until 1993, when the results of a General Accounting Office study spawned personnel changes.
Since then, hundreds of enlisted weapons directors have entered the career field and attended the required nine-month basic technical school in Arizona.
The school includes six months of training at the Tucson Air National Guard Base and three months of training on modular equipment at Luke AFB.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The Guard and active duty (enlisted) weapons directors are just about par with each other,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Peters, when asked if any differences exist between the two military organizations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½They (the Air Guard) are getting tasked as much as we are these days and really stepping up to the challenges.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Winter 2003 The Oregon Sentinel Page 8 Oregon Army National Guard units receive deployment excellence award Arlington, Virginia.
The awards were presented by the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, Maj. Gen. Claude V. Christianson, on behalf of the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Peter J. Schoomaker.
The 1st Battalion, 186th Infantry Regiment mobilized and deployed in April 2002, from Ashland, Ore. as part of a Multinational Force and observer mission in Sinai, Egypt.
The Oregon National Guard won both the small and large-size unit categories.
Accepting the award were Lt. Col. Dan Cameron and Lt. Col. Todd Plimpton, past and current commanders of 1st Battalion, 186th Inf, respectively.
The 1042nd Medical Company (Air Ambulance) mobilized and deployed from Salem, Ore. in April 2002, to Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Desert Spring, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.
Maj. Matt Brady and Capt. Tom Lingle, past and current commanders of the unit were on hand to accept the awards.
The Deployment Excellence Awards (DEA) recognizes excellence in deployment operations and is co-sponsored by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4 (Logistics) and the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3 (Operations) and administered by the Commander, U.S. Army Transportation Center.
The objectives of the DEAs recognize units and installations for outstanding deployment accomplishments which meet or exceed established deployment standards, and to capture and share innovative deployment initiatives which have improved the deployment process.
The program promotes competition at the unit and major command level and provides award recognition at the Department of the Army level.
The DEA recognized active Army, Army Reserve and Army National Guard organizations that have achieved the highest levels of readiness in executing their deployments. l to r: Maj. Mathew J.

Strong, State Public Affairs Officer The Oregon Army National GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s 1st Battalion, 186th Infantry and the 1042 Medical Company (Air Ambulance), from Ashland and Salem respectively, were recognized for deployment excellence at a ceremony held on August 27, 2003 in Oregon Army Guard builds House of Hope for Iraqis in Mosul By 1st Lt. Emil Buzaid Public Affairs Rep, 52nd Engineer Battalion Mosul, Iraq Ã¯Â¿Â½ There is a house in the city of Mosul, Iraq that represents great possibilities for the future of this war-torn country.
It is a tiny house by American standards, but the House of Hope is only the beginning of a much more ambitious project.
This house is unique in that it is the first one built with the combined efforts of US soldiers and Iraqi workers.
The primary intent of this project is to train former members of the Iraqi military in basic block masonry construction.
A secondary benefit of the project is that it will eventually provide places to live for displaced families in the city of Mosul.
In Phase one of a three-phase operation, which was completed in mid-August, a platoon of US Army engineers moved in and began construction of a single prototype house.
In an environment such as exists in Mosul, sometimes just getting around in the city can be difficult and dangerous, so building this one house presented a significant challenge to the soldiers who got the task.
First platoon, B/52 Engineers is used to dealing with challenges.
As part of a tri-component engineer battalion, the soldiers in the platoon have become accustomed to adapting to the differences between the active duty, guard, and reserve elements of the unit.
Most of the soldiers in first platoon are members of the Oregon National Guard, who got the call in February and less than a week later found themselves at Fort Carson, Co.
There they not only had to deal with the icy cold Colorado winter and the high altitude, but also the adjustment from their normal lives to the full-time Army.
On top of that, the platoon took on five soldiers from the active component of the battalion, including a brand-new platoon leader just three months out of the officer Ã¯Â¿Â½s basic course.
Having met all of these challenges and more on the way to Mosul, the troops were ready for just about anything.
As work on the phase one house got underway, the soldiers quickly discovered that American methods are not always effective when working with Iraqi materials.
So, they took on some local workers to help make building the house somewhat easier.
These local workers taught the soldiers new ways of working with concrete blocks and mortar, while also providing them the unique opportunity to work hand-in-hand with Iraqis on a daily basis.
There were many more challenges to face as work continued on the first house, but the soldiers and their new Iraqi friends overcame all of them.
At the end of two months of work, the first house is complete.
This house is now being used to develop a training model for the former Iraqi soldiers that the platoon plans to train as well as to revise and refine the design for future houses.
This second phase consists of hiring a select group of former Iraqi soldiers to build another set of houses.
In phase two, the troops from the platoon that built the first house can apply what they learned there to teach the new hires, and it is already underway.
Phase three will begin in the near future, as the soldiers will step back from their responsibilities as trainers and turn primarily to inspection and quality control on the project.
Eventually, the intent of the House of Hope project is to provide many more jobs to IraqÃ¯Â¿Â½s former soldiers so that they can earn money for their families by taking up shovels, picks, and trowels rather than rifles and RPGs.

Mobilization: OregonÃ¯Â¿Â½s Finest head to Mid-East Continued from Page 1 Headquarters, and the family support program.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Without your continued love and support, these men would not have been able to accomplish what they have been, or what theyÃ¯Â¿Â½re about to do.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hendrickson said.
He also added that he was privileged to work with the fine men and women of the Ã¯Â¿Â½Volunteer BattalionÃ¯Â¿Â½, and proud to represent Oregon.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ You have demonstrated outstanding dedication, commitment, and professionalism as youÃ¯Â¿Â½ve prepared both yourselves and your unit to mobilize and deploy.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hendrickson continued.
Soldiers from the 2-162 come from more than 140 communities in Oregon, southwest Washington and northern California.
The mobilization involves more than 700 troops, making this the largest mobilization of Oregon soldiers from Oregon since World War II.
Many of the soldiers in the latest deployment volunteered for duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Volunteers received 11B (Infantry) and 11C (Mortar) training at Camp Rilea on the Oregon Coast to qualify and receive a secondary MOS (military occupational specialty).
In Ft. Hood, Texas, personnel are currently undergoing training to improve their soldier skills, as well as receiving specialized training specific to the theater of operations, information on cultural differences and urban warfare training.
Hendrickson looked forward to the training, saying that the unit was ready to train hard, and, if necessary, fight.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Together, weÃ¯Â¿Â½re going to do great things,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hendrickson said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Things thatÃ¯Â¿Â½ll make our families, our state, and our nation proud.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Brig. Gen. Raymond C. Byrne, Acting Adjutant General of the state of Oregon, called the deployment a team effort, calling for individuals to look out for each other.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help transition the people of Iraq to a more democratic way of life.Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Byrne.

Kulongoski praised members of the unit, noting the large number of Oregon Guardmembers now serving in deployments overseas.
Ã¯Â¿Â½I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t think it is a mere coincidence that per capita, Oregon has the highest percentage of guardsmen deployed of any state in the country.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Kulongoski.
Governor Kulongoski also presented the Oregon State Flag to Hendrickson, requesting that it be flown over the unitÃ¯Â¿Â½s command center, once they arrive in Iraq.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ You are the best Ã¯Â¿Â½ and our senior military commanders know it.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Our unit became more cohesive than ever.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ According to Olson, the unit executed their mission flawlessly, helping to maintain and control the safety of the skies with a combat-ready, tactical air battle management platform.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We are the eyes of the sky, Ã¯Â¿Â½ explained Maj. Jim Gregory, director of operations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½If or when an enemy force invades our protected airspace, they show up on our radar scopesÃ¯Â¿Â½we then communicate with friendly-force fighter aircraft and direct pilots where and when to launch their missiles.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Gregory also added that the 116th ACS members were very supportive of each other at work and outside of work.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ WeÃ¯Â¿Â½re more like a family than anything else.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Bur gin summarized the unitÃ¯Â¿Â½s professionalism.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ You answered the call and did it immediately, without question and with a lot of expertise,Ã¯Â¿Â½ he remarked.

By Maj. Donna Prigmore Public Affairs Officer, 142 FW On September 11, 2003, when Americans across the country reflected on the tragedies that occurred two years ago, members of the Oregon Air National GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s 11 6 th Air Control Squadron also reflected, not just upon that eventful day, but over the past two years as well.
In 2001, just thirteen days after the shocking events of 9/11 when terror marked American soil, over 100 members of the 116 ACS were called to active duty.
They didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t know it at the time, but many of them would be activated (in support of Operation Noble Eagle) for 730 days before being officially demobilized as a unit on September 23, 2003.
In honor of the 11 6 th ACSÃ¯Â¿Â½ many accomplishments over the two-year activation period, a special demobilization ceremony was held at the Camp Rilea Armed Forces Training Center on September 11, 2003.
Approximately 150 people were in attendance, including Mr. Craig Campbell, Policy Advisor to Gov. Ted Kulongoski; Mr. David Robinson, Program Manager, Battle Management Systems, National Guard Bureau; Maj. Gen. Alexander H. Burgin, former Adjutant General of Oregon; and Warrenton Mayor Jeff Hazen.
During their call to active duty, the 11 6 th ACS deployed for 355 (nonconsecutive) days to five different states, including Jackson, Wyoming where they set-up radar surveillance seven dif ferent times during Vice President Dick CheneyÃ¯Â¿Â½s visits to the Grand Teton National Park region.
When not deployed, the unit members worked from their facility at Camp Rilea.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The demands you have been faced with have been extraordinaryÃ¯Â¿Â½you put your futures on hold and sacrificed time with your families,Ã¯Â¿Â½ remarked Campbell in front of the 116th ACS airmen standing in formation during the ceremony.
Ã¯Â¿Â½It is a high price for freedom and you have the GovernorÃ¯Â¿Â½s respect for being willing to pay it.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The unit, considered one of the busiest air control squadrons in the nation, also deployed to Mt.

Gen. (ret.) Carol A. Mutter at ShennaniganÃ¯Â¿Â½s Restaurant near Swan Island in North Portland.
Mutter, the only three-star general in the Marines, is touring the country speaking to civic leaders and military organizations regarding women in the armed forces.
She currently serves as Lt. Gen. Carol A. Mutter. the Chairperson of the Defense Department Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS), and is also the president of the Women Marines Association, a non-profit veteranÃ¯Â¿Â½s organization.
Mutter referred to young people entering the armed services as Ã¯Â¿Â½superbly-motivated individualsÃ¯Â¿Â½, who felt as if they were doing something worthwhile when called to support their community and country.
But expectations have changed for both the military member and society, she cautioned.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The way weÃ¯Â¿Â½ve set up and recruited for the National Guard,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mutter said, Ã¯Â¿Â½isnÃ¯Â¿Â½t really relevant in the world today.
Pressures on family and employers have to be examined to see how we can make individuals in the military more useful to the nation, and the entire process less painful to the family and employer.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mutter encouraged all veterans to tell their stories, but especially women.

Throughout the year, and especially during these peak travel times, Space-A air travel provides a cost-effective alternative to packages offered by the commercial airlines.
Here in the Pacific Northwest, there are three locations from which Space-A flights arrive and depart.
These include McChord and Fairchild AFB, and Whidbey Island.
Interested parties can obtain flight information and schedules through the following contact numbers: McChord AFB, WA - (253) 982-7268; Fairchild AFB, WA - (509) 247-5435; Whidbey Island NAS, WA - (360) 257-2604; Oregon Army National Guard Flight Operations, Salem, OR Ã¯Â¿Â½ (503) 584-3385; Oregon Air National Guard Flight Operations, Portland, OR -(503) 335-4390.
Because of the high level of security and ongoing military operations, admittance to bases and air terminals is stricter, but there are more flights than usual to catch.
On-base quarters can be difficult to obtain especially at bases like PANG where there is no on-base billeting, but for the larger bases such as McChord and Fairchild, with more than 24-hoursÃ¯Â¿Â½ notice, you may be able to find on-base accommodations.
Alternative lodging can be found at www.choicehotels,which offers discounts for military members and on-line booking.
Recent changes in the MEDEVAC flights have occurred with the C-9Ã¯Â¿Â½s being taken out of service.
AMC is now using KC-130Ã¯Â¿Â½s, C-141Ã¯Â¿Â½s, and C-17Ã¯Â¿Â½s for this duty.
Special pallets/seating is installed in the aircraft and Space-A is stillpermitted, if space and flight personnel permit.
With the increased operations tempo for the C-17 fleet, this is an excellent time to fly to the East Coast or toRheinMain, Germany, from McChord AFB. Reservists and National Guardsmen, not drawing retired pay, can fly only in CONUS, AK, HI, and US possessions.

Our newsletter makes a great gift for family members in the military, retirement gifts, you name it! Find out about your education and employment rights With the lar ge number of guard members deploying around the world, many questions have arisen about their student loans and employment rights.
The US Department of Education has a website located at http://ifap.ed.gov/ dpcletters/G03347.html, that addresses most questions regarding the repayment of student loans.
One of the documents listed on this site is DCL ID G-03-347, which addresses deferments and forbearance of student loans for activated military members.
The document covers extended in-school deferment, or a grace period of up to 3 years while the borrower is on active duty.
It also requires the lender to grant a forbearance of 1 year upon request.
Finally, it requires the lender to cease collection efforts on leans in default during the borrower Ã¯Â¿Â½s military service.
However, the letter does not have any provisions for forgiveness of the loan.
They are still the responsibility of the borrower.
Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), deployed guard members are to be promptly reinstated to their civilian jobs upon their return.
Soldiers and Airmen are entitled to the same position and level of seniority they had at the time of their military activation.
The Oregon National Guard is taking a proactive role to educate military members and employers so everyone understands their respective rights and obligations under the law.

Donna Prigmore Public Affairs Officer, 142 FW In late Spring of this year, the 173d Fighter Wing began modification of the entire Air National Guard F-15 fleet.
The year-long project will install the ALE-58 Infrared Defensive System on According to Chief Master Sgt.
Edward J. Fenner, equipment maintenance flight chief, a total of 96 F-15s from Louisiana, Missouri, Hawaii, Florida, Oregon and Massachusetts.
The ALE-58 Infrared Defensive System is an upgraded flare dispensing system that will increase the combat capability of the F-15 in an infrared environment.
The defensive system dispenses chaff and infrared flares to help a pilot evade enemy radar and missiles.
Chaff is a material ejected into the air that reflects radar waves thereby confusing an enemyÃ¯Â¿Â½s radar systems.
Infrared flares produce a heat source that is greater than a jet engine, which, when released, confuses incoming heatseeking missiles, allowing a pilot to take evasive action.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s the first time a guard unit has done anything like this,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Fenner.
The upgrade consists of additional wiring in the aircraft and adding flare dispensers to the wing pylon.
Ã¯Â¿Â½At any time weÃ¯Â¿Â½ll have five aircraft going through the process of being worked on,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Fenner.
The project created twelve temporary military positions responsible for the preand post-modification work, while thirteen civilians from Boeing will perform the actual installation of the defensive system.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Guard F-15s will be modified with the new defense system before the active duty Air Force.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½This shows that the guard can do anything and make it better,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Fenner.
The process of Kingsley FieldÃ¯Â¿Â½s selection for the project began a couple years ago when Boeing was looking for a place to modify the Air National GuardÃ¯Â¿Â½s fleet of F-15s.
The 173rd Fighter Wing was the first to step up to the plate, volunteering its fleet of F-15 fighters.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Boeing began looking at Kingsley Field as a viable place to conduct the modification,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Fenner.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Kingsley Field was also strongly considered Photo by Staff Sgt. Jennifer Shirar, 173rd Fighter Wing Multimedia SeniorAirman Sean McDougal (l) and SeniorAirman Rachel Carlisle (r) replace the screws on one of the access panels on the wing of an F-15 jet after a Phase inspection in August 2003.
because of extra hangar space as well as the unitÃ¯Â¿Â½s reputation for excellence.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Last year, Kingsley Field was designated as the site for the project.
Ã¯Â¿Â½This gives us visibility in the guard and shows what we can do,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Lt. Col. Mark Favetti, 173rd Fighter Wing maintenance commander.
Ã¯Â¿Â½It also allows us to hire more people and in the long run helps in recruiting.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Congress will make changes to TRICARE benefits for guardmembers, reservists Prepared by Sentinel Staff Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., flanked by a bi-partisan group of senators, announced plans on Sept. 10th to add a TRICARE amendment to the presidentÃ¯Â¿Â½s $87 billion supplemental bill to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The amendment would offer TRICARE coverage to Guardsmen and Reservists on a cost-share basis, regardless of their activation status.
Ã¯Â¿Â½There is no differentiation between active duty personnel on the front lines in Iraq or National Guard personnel on the front lines,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Daschle said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½They both serve their country so ably, and both ought to be supported as they are considered for the (military) needs we have.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Daschle was joined by Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Mike DeWine, R-Ohio.
Graham, who agreed with Sen. John Warner , R-Va., and the Defense Department in July to wait for another study on TRICARE and put off such a plan, changed his mind after a recent visit to Iraq.
Ã¯Â¿Â½I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t need to study this anymore,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Graham said.
Ã¯Â¿Â½IÃ¯Â¿Â½m hoping that the administration would go with us.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Leahy added that the two questions he receives about Guard and Reserve personnel always concern when the deployments will end and health care issues.
This amendment, he said, would Ã¯Â¿Â½improve readinessÃ¯Â¿Â½ and Ã¯Â¿Â½is the right thing to do.Ã¯Â¿Â½ WednesdayÃ¯Â¿Â½s announcement marks the third attempt this year to extend health care coverage for Guardsmen, an effort the NGAUS has supported from the beginning.
Ã¯Â¿Â½The NGAUS has been working strongly to gain health care coverage for members of the National Guard for over three years now, Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Bill Goss, legislative director of the NGAUS.
Ã¯Â¿Â½It would definitely provide health care for those members of the Guard and Reserve who are unable to afford it.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In addition, Goss said it would serve as a recruiting and retention tool and make mobilization much easier.
Right now, more than 20 percent of NGAUS members donÃ¯Â¿Â½t have health care coverage.
The Senate originally passed an amendment to the 2004 defense authorization bill in May that provided TRICARE coverage to Guardsmen and Reservists, with fees waived upon mobilization.
Rates in the amendment would provide enlisted members with coverage at $330 per year for individuals or $560 for families.
Officers would pay $50 more.
These rates are similar to retiree rates.
On July 8, however, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld sent a letter to lawmakers saying the coverage would cost $5.1 billion and force cuts in other areasÃ¯Â¿Â½a figure 17 times that of a Congressional Budget Office estimate made earlier this year.
Rumsfeld also said he would recommend the president veto the authorization if it included TRICARE for Guardsmen and Reservists.
Daschle responded introducing a similar amendment to the Ã¯Â¿Â½Defense Appropriations Act, 2004.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The plan was a compromise between Daschle and Graham, who served in the South Carolina Air Guard during the Gulf War in 1991.
Daschle said he had faith in this amendment and said the Guard possibly could have coverage by the end of the year.
But first, the supplemental bill must make it through the house where Guard health care coverage has had a more difficult time.

Guard, reservists to get additional tax break A bill currently being introduced will provide an above-the-line deduction for transportation, meals, and lodging expenses of National Guard and Reserve members who must travel more than 100 miles away from home (and stay overnight) to attend reserve meetings.
Section 109 states that members that incur such expenses will be able to deduct them from income regardless of whether they itemize their deductions, or whether their total employee business expenses exceed two percent of their adjusted gross income.
The new deduction is limited to the rates for such expenses authorized for federal employees (including per diem in lieu of subsistence).
The provision applies to expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 2002.
The new deduction, which could be used by more than a million taxpayers, will require processing changes and additional communications for the 2004 filing season.
Ordinarily, a separate line entry for this adjustment would be added to the Adjusted Gross Income section of the Form 1040 to accommodate the deduction, and the form instructions would provide guidance on how to compute the deduction.
Since changes to the 2003 Form 1040, and instructions, are no longer possible (they are currently being printed), the deduction for 2003 will have to be taken as a write-in entry on line 33.
Also, IRS will have to employ an alternative to the Form 1040 instructions for furnishing reservists with the guidance necessary to compute their 2003 deduction and make the correct write-in entry.
One possibility is to include such guidance in Pub. 3, the Armed Forces Tax Guide, (or a special supplement) that the Department of Defense would distribute to reservists.
ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s estimated that as many as one million reservists may qualify for the new deduction.

st Recruiting and Retention Command Honors its Top Performers By Sgt. 1st Class Guy Britnell, Recruiting Marketing NCOIC Senator encourages donation of frequent flier miles Washington, DC Ã¯Â¿Â½ Senator Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) recently launched a new page on his website to provide information on how Americans can donate their frequent flyer miles to help troops stationed in Iraq fly home on leave.
The web page can be accessed from SmithÃ¯Â¿Â½s Senate website at http://gsmith.senate.gov.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We should be doing everything we can to help those who are putting their lives on the line to win the war against terror, Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Smith.
Ã¯Â¿Â½I want to encourage Oregonians to donate their frequent flyer miles to help these courageous men and women get home to spend quality time with their loved ones.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In September 2003, the Pentagon started giving two week leaves to military personnel stationed in Iraq.

Until funding becomes available, however, they are responsible for flights to their eventual destinations which are often high-priced, last minute tickets.
To ease this burden, some airlines are accepting donations of frequent flyer miles to be used by soldiers on leave.
Up to 500 troops per day have been coming home on leave.
Ã¯Â¿Â½Our troops are facing enough hardships without having to worry about how they will be able to afford to fly home when they are on leave,Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Smith.
Ã¯Â¿Â½These airlines are providing the opportunity for soldiers to use their much-deserved time to see family and friends and to ease the numerous burdens resting on AmericaÃ¯Â¿Â½s finest.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Coming in December Special Holiday issue of the Oregon Sentinel PRSRT STD US Postage PAID Permit #178 Salem, OR OFFICE OF THE STATE ADJUTANT GENERAL DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE NATIONAL GUARD OF OREGON P.O. BOX 14350 SALEM, OREGON 97309-5047 OFFICIAL BUISINESS The Oregon Army National Guard's Recruiting and Retention Command held its annual awards banquet on October 24, 2003 in Lincoln City, Ore.
The event is held to honor the Recruiting and Retention Non-Commissioned Officers in the state that have excelled during the year, with the top honor of the "Chief 's 54 Award" going to the top recruiter in the state.
In order to qualify for this prestigious award, a recruiter must demonstrate excellence in all three tenants of Strength Maintenance -- recruiting, retention and attrition management.
This year 's Chief 's 54 recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Greg Bogard, was also honored on the national level recently in Washington DC.
The Master 7 Award goes to the top Recruiting Area Supervisor in the state.
Again, this award is based on the supervisor 's team demonstrating excellence in all thr ee tenants of St r ength Maintenance.
This year 's recipient is Master Sgt.
Bob Droke of eastern Oregon.
Droke was also selected as the Recruiting and Retention Advisory Committee Six (RRAC 6) Master 7.
RRAC 6 covers the northwestern states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, and also includes Alaska.
"For me to travel to Washington D.C. and receive the Master 7 Award for RRAC 6 was truly a great way to end my military career.
I am totally aware and grateful that it was made possible by the dedication and hard work ethics of the seven soldiers that I supervise", said Droke.
Lt. Col. Beverly Herard, Recruiting and Retention Commander, said, "The annual conference has become somewhat a conference of traditions.
For instance, we involve family members in all activities and the formal dinner in dress blues, honoring the soldiers and families has become a tradition.
Next year, we are planning the first `retiree social' during the conference.
We'll invite all retired members of the Recruiting Force."
Because of the transformation from HQ STARC to Joint Force Headquarters Oregon, the Air National Guard recruiting force was also invited to the conference.
"This year we took a major step toward joint integration with the participation of the Air National Guard recruiting force.
The bonding of both forces was tremendous.
We realized how compatible and mtually-sustainable we can be."
Herard concluded.
