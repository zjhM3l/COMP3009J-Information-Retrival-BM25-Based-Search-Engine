A Historical Perspective on Biological Warfare (BW) Outline Â· How BW has been used throughout history Â· U.S. 
Definition of Terms Â· Biological warfare: specialized type of warfare conducted by government against a target Â· Bioterrorism: use or threat of use of biological agents in furtherance of political, social, religious objectives Â· Biocrime: use of biological agents for murder, extortion, or revenge
Disadvantages of Biological Warfare #1: May not ever be able to determine if it was effective #2: The difficulty in protecting one's own troops #3: Difficulty in decontamination may preclude the use of acquired territory #4: Naturally occurring disease may cloud issue
Pre-Modern Era
6th- 4th Century B.C. 600 B.C.: Assyrians poisoned wells of opponents with rye ergot 500 B.C.: Greco-Romans contaminated wells 
Scythian Warriors- 400 B.C. Â· Nomadic warriors Â· Mixed poisonous snakes, human blood 
Hannibal: 190 B.C.
Â· Â· Â· Â· Best known for using elephants Also used naval 
History of Plague Â· Â· Â· Â· Long history: 3 pandemics Natural reservoir is rat Vector- fleas When rat dies, infected fleas leave host 
First Pandemic: Justinian Age AD 542-543 Â· Generally viewed as first cycle of plague Â· Began in Egypt 
Second Pandemic: 14th-17th Centuries Â· "Black Death" Â· Claimed 20-30 million, 1/3 Europe's population
Biological Warfare 
Narrative Excerpts The Disease: "But behold, the whole army was affected by a disease that overran the Tartars 
Narrative Excerpts Biological Warfare: "The dying Tartars, stunned 
But they ordered corpses to be place in catapults 
What seemed like mountains of dead were thrown into the city 
And soon the rotting corpses tainted the air, poisoned the water supply, 
Moreover one infected man could carry the poison to others, 
No one knew or could discover a means of defense."
"Dark Ages" "The result of the introduction of the bubonic plague into Europe was devastating.
There were too few people to work the land, estates lost financial power that, in turn, provided an opportunity for kings to centralize power.
Teachers 
Hence the term "Dark Ages".

"Ring around the roseys Pocket full of poseys Ashes, ashes We all fall down"
"Ring Around the Rosey" Â· Is actually a rhyme about the plague.
Â· People infected with plague would get red circular sores ("Ring around the rosey"), Â· These sores smelled very badly so people put flowers on their bodies to cover the smell of sores ("a pocket full of posies"), Â· People who died from plague were burned to reduce possible spread disease ("ashes, ashes, we all fall down").
Could Plague been Caused by BW? Â· Hurled diseased cadavers could easily have transmitted plague (US history of contact with infected material) Â· Cadavers mangled by hurling, defenders probably had cuts or abrasions from bombardments, large numbers of cadavers, disposal of cadavers Â· Probably NOT cause of spread throughout Med. basin
Disadvantage # 4: Naturally occurring disease Vs. BW
Thoughts Â· "Black Death" was probably greatest public health disaster in recorded history Â· One of most dramatic examples of emerging or re-emerging disease
