The Pyramid Part II of the Series Thieves Market Teacher's Guide By Ruth Graves Cooper, Ph.D.
Funded by the Arizona Corporation Commission Securities Division In cooperation with the Arizona Department of Education Teacher's Guide_________________________________ "The Pyramid," an educational video for high school students, describes an illegal investment scheme called pyramid, which in its purest form is typically a plan where people invest in the right to sell an investment or product.
Generally the product to be sold is ignored as participants in the pyramid try to turn a quick profit from commissions earned by recruiting salespeople.
The pyramid is similar to a chain letter, which inevitably collapses as participants try to recover their initial investment.
Objectives "The Pyramid" is the second in the series titled "Thieves Market."
The video is designed both to familiarize students with pyramid schemes and to teach them how to avoid involvement.
At the conclusion of this program, a student will be able to: A. Recognize a pyramid scheme B. Recognize the warning signals for a pyramid scheme.
C. Apply steps to avoid a pyramid scheme.
D. Define: caveat emptor, fraud, pyramid scheme, multilevel marketing (MLM).
Before the Program Tell the students they are going to view a video on a crime called "The Pyramid."

Start at the top point of the pyramid and explain that a person sets out to make quick, illegal money.
Tell them to watch the video to see how a pyramid works.
Program Summary Bob Metzner is an unemployed roofer.
He meets a successful-looking man named Stewart.
Stewart explains to Bob that just a year ago he was also unemployed.
Today, Stewart has money for anything he wants.
All of this was the result of his success as a salesman for Master Motivators.
Despite protests from his family, Bob spends $100 to attend an introductory meeting of Master Motivators.
At the meeting, Bob is persuaded to borrow $5000 against his house in order to become a salesman for the company.
Bob is promised $1000 for each salesperson he recruits.
Bob begins to recruit, and as a result, many of Bob's friends and relatives join him at the next Master Motivators meeting.
As Bob and Stewart are talking to the group, an investigator for the Arizona Corporation Commission arrives to arrest everyone for participating in a pyramid scheme.

Each person Bob signed up must pay $5000 to become a salesperson with this company.
Who gets the money? (Ans.
Bob receives $1000 per person and the rest goes to Stewart, Bob's recruiter, and Jason, the owner of the company.)
3.
Why is the pyramid scheme illegal? (Ans.
Pyramids are illegal in Arizona due to Arizona Revised Statutes, Section 44-1731 through 44-1735.
This law makes it a felony for anyone to establish, operate, or promote a pyramid.
A pyramid promotional scheme is described in the law under Section 44-1731.3 as any plan by which a participant gives money or value where he expects to receive a return primarily from "introduction of other persons into the plan...rather than from the sale of goods."
4.
Multilevel marketing (MLM) is similar to a pyramid scheme.
MLMs are legal franchises where salespeople recruit more salespeople to sell cars, soap powder, or encyclopedias for a commission.
What is the difference between a pyramid scheme and a multilevel marketing scheme? (Ans.
A multilevel marketing company concentrates on selling a product.
They encourage the recruitment of salespeople by letting the recruiters share in the sales proceeds of those who make sales under their guidance.
A pyramid scheme is designed to bring in more and more salespeople who pay to sign up.
A sales recruiter gets paid a commission for each new salesperson hired.
Pyramid schemes pay little attention to the product, and simply sell salesperson positions.)
5.
Why do pyramids collapse? (Ans.
A pyramid requires an endless number of potential participants.
For example, if a pyramid scheme starts with 20 participants, each of whom recruits 3 persons, who in turn recruit 3 more persons and so on, the number of participants will exceed the United States population by the 16th generation of recruits.
Generation 20 80 260 800 2,420 7,280 21,860 65,600 196,820 590,420 1,771,440 5,314,340 15,943,160 47,829,620 143,489,000 430,467,140 The Pyramid REV 01.doc Warning Signals 1.
