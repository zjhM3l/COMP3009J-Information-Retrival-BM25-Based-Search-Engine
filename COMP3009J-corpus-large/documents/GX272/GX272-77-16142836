SUMMARY Ninety three frogs were submitted for evaluation.
Frog malformations were classified into 6 major categories and 12 subcategories based on necropsy observations of 72 frogs (Appendix J) and the findings of radiographs performed on 69 of thes e 72 frog s (App endix D ).
Although there were no Vermont frogs with rotation as its primarily malformation rotations did occur in relation w ith other m alform ations an d did res emb le som e of the M inneso ta rotations .
Rotations were most likely to occur in frogs with ectrodactyly or brachydactyly (missing or shortened digits) suggesting that errors in the bone formation was occurring proximal to the affected d igits (4 frogs).
L imb r otation also occur red in tw o frogs with fem oral hem imelia of the opp osite limb and in the sa me lim b as tibiafibula r hem imelia in a nother frog.
It appeared that the more proximal the source of rotational abnormality (ie femur vs tibiafibula), the m ore sev erely the prope lling surfac e deviate d from the norm .

INTERPRETATION OF DATA Although the number of frogs submitted from each site was low, it seems important to look at the data to see if there was an association between malformation type and body condition.
The potential impact a particular abnormalities migh t have on frog suc cess, as re presen ted by ge neral bo dy con dition or n utritional statu s, migh t also be acc essible through data analysis.
Data from the field studies will be needed to determine if the malformations submitted from each site for this study were truly representative of the population in both malformation type and frequency of malfo rma tions pre sent.
Although data should be corrected for population variation due to site variables as well as for weight bias secondary to absence of body parts in particular abnormalities, I feel looking at the frog morphology data, as in this scatter diagram, could provide insight into the association between the type of abnormality in the frog and body condition of those frogs, represented by the frog's weight in relation to length.
The average body condition for all of the types of m alform ations w as poo r to em aciated w ith the exce ption of fro gs with amelia that were all very emaciated.
B. MO RP HO LO GIC FIN DIN GS IN F RO GS FRO M EA CH STU DY SITE : Malformations from Vermont were 93% reduction malformations (amelia, hemimelia or ectrodactyly).
Only 3 frogs submitted with malformations evaluated had an abnormality that did not involve truncation of a limb.
(R. Brann ian, National W ildlife Health Center, pers. com m., 19 97; J. H elgen, M inneso ta Pollution Con trol Ag ency, p ers. com m., 19 97).
The causes of the rise in amphibian deformities remain unclear, however, a number of hypotheses are presently being researched including: xenobiotic chemicals, parasites, and UV-B light.
Some researchers have indicated that classifying the types of abnorm alities on a site will be helpful in isolating the causal agent or agents (C. M eteyer, NW HC , pers. com m., 19 97).
In 1997, 19 sites in the Lake Champlain Basin in Vermont were surveyed for frog deformities.
Rates greater than three percent were observed at 17 of the sites.
Rates overall ranged from 0-45% and averaged approximately 8% (R. Levey, State of Vermont, pers. comm., 1997).
A BRD Quick Initiative Grant of $8000 awarded to this project allowed the National Wildlife Health Center to conduct a workup of the abnormal frogs collected in Vermont.
The workup included classification of abno rma lities, histopatho logy, ne crops y, virolo gy, bac teriology , and par asitology .
The re sults of this wor k sugg ested that the re wa s no cor relation b etwee n viruse s, bacteria , or para sites and the frog abn orm alities obser ved in Vermont (C. M eteyer, NWH C, pers. comm., 1997).
What the work did not include, due to insufficient funds, was skeletal analysis through radiology.
This additional work should clarify whether the abnormalities observed are deform ities, caused by traum a or disea se, or m alform ations, cau sed by a disfunctio n in deve lopm ent. Th e wo rk sho uld also serve to diagnose any skeletal abnormalities not externally observable.
Objective : To determine through radiology of frogs collected in Vermont in 1997 whether the abnormalities observed are developmental in nature or trauma induced, as well as to diagnose skeletal abnormalities not externally observable.
Exp ected P rodu cts : A written report of the project findings will be prepared.
The work will be presented at professional meetings and will be incorporated into peer-reviewed literature.

25 APPENDIX B: PROGRESS REPORT FOR USGS-BRD PROJECTS FUNDED BY EASTERN REGION QUICK RESPONSE MONEY PROJECT LEADER: USGS-BRD ORGANIZATION: Dr. C arol U. M eteyer, Dr. K athryn Co nverse National Wildlife Health Center - Madison PROJECT TITLE: Radiographic Characterization of Abnormal Frogs from Selected Sites in Vermont PROJECT COSTS: $ 2,000 Malformations of Vermont frogs collected during the summer of 1997 were characterized during necropsy examination, and lab tests wer e perfo rme d to deter mine if there we re assoc iations betw een diag nostic findin gs and malfo rma tions.
Following that study, we obtained ultradetail radiographic equipment which provided very detailed and magnified images of bone changes in the frogs.
Given this new capability, quick response money was requested and provided in 1998 for a retrosp ective rad iograp hic study of these fro gs to see if ther e wer e specific bo ne cha nges u nique fo r frogs c ollected in Vermont or at specific sites in Vermont.
Radiographs of 33 frogs collected in 1997 from 4 Verm ont sites have been perfor med and inter pretation of these rad iograp hic chan ges is com plete.
Res ults of these find ings are in the attache d data table w hich inclu des a un ique class ification system develo ped thr ough insight gain ed from radiog raphic imag es.
This tab le combines description of necropsy and radiographic findings.
At this time we are determining significance of the radiographic findings based on malformation type and geographic distribution of the frogs.
A final report will be sent by December 31, 1998 to the USGS -BRD E astern Regional Office, USFW S Region 5, and the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources after the radiographic findings are incorporated into the overall final report for the Vermont study.
We are currently looking for funding to extend this study to include microscopic characterization of bone changes with comparison to gross and radiographic findings in an effort to more completely delineate factors that might be contributing to the prod uction o f malfo rma tions at the cellu lar level.

Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography.
Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from malfo rma tion, althou gh nec ropsy observ ations an d histopa thology were also imp ortant in ru ling out trau ma. Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix G).
Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes.
One of the characteristic types of microscopic change seen at the termination of the malfo rme d limb was v ery diso rganiz ed and hyper plastic cartilag e that wa s not ossifyin g norm ally and inte rfered with the formation of bone cortex.
The second type of bone change seen at the point of termination was the formation of sma ll nests of end osteal type cartilage m atrix w ith som e orga nization b ut no ob vious m aturation or ossification .
None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development at the term inal end.
T raum atic am putation s did hav e micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation.
There were no microscopic changes in internal organs that could be related to malformations.
The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding.
Virology cultures were conducted on 51 tissues on 2 different cell lines adapted for amphibians and electron microscopy was performed on selected homogenates of frog tissues to determine if viruses were present.
No viruses were isolated or identified in any Vermont frogs.
Bacterial cultures were performed on 44 tissues and 98 bacteria were isolated and identified.
There did not appear to be any direct association between bacterial isolates and the observed malformations.
Parasitologic examinations were conducted on 14 frogs.
Although the parasitology sample size was small, no association could be found between the presen ce of m etacerc aria and the occu rrenc e of m alform ations.

BACKGROUND During the summer of 1995, a group of school children conducting a wetland nature study observed a high rate of abnormal leopard frogs in Henderson County, Minnesota.
Since 1995, occurrence of deformed frogs have been reported in 42 states and 3 Canadian provinces (Gilbertson).
The species reported have included northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), spring peeper (Hyla crucifer), American toad (Bufo americanus), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana ), wood frog (Rana sylvatica ), green frog (Rana clamitans), pickerel frog (Ran a palustris ), and mink frog (Ran a septen trionalis ).
Studies, funded by the USGS Biological Resource Division's Eastern Region in coordination with the Vermont Age ncy of N atural R esour ces, and the U.S .
Fish an d W ildlife Serv ice, we re initiated thr ough the Na tional W ildlife Health Center in the summer of 1997.
The objectives of the study were to characterize frog abnormalities, document the distribu tion of m alform ed frog s, determ ine the freq uency of ma lform ations, collec t baseline m orph om etric measurement of frogs, and collect water and sediment samples for analysis.
The National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) was requested to assist in defining the developmental problems in Vermont frogs.
The role of the NWHC was to perform diagnostic assessments of abnormal and normal frogs from Vermont sites that were known to have malformed frogs.
The diagnostic evaluation included gross necropsy examination, histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology.
In the spring of 1998 funding became available to perform radiology on a subset of the Ver mo nt frogs.
A report of preliminary findings was presented at the NIH/NIEHS Workshop on Strategies for Assessing the Implications of Malformed Frogs for Environmental Health held December 4-5, 1997 at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
The data we presented at the conference made it clear that teratogenesis was occurring in tadpoles of the northern leopard frog.
Factors that have been shown in the lab to cause teratogenesis are numerous falling into the general categories of genetic or environmental.
Some environmental factors that can influence development are; chemical, thermal, infectious, or trauma-related factors such as UV radiation which can cause cell damage.
Tadpoles are free-living postembryonic organisms that achieve all of their intricate developmental milestones without the pro tection of a sh ell or uteru s.
The en vironm ent in w hich thes e tadpo les deve lop is com plex an d dyn amic .
Sorting out the significant physical and chemical (molecular) factors that are contributing to teratogenesis in the frogs from those facto rs that are c oincide ntally pre sent in the en vironm ent with out direc t effect is impo rtant.
M alform ations can indicate a ge neral tim e fram e durin g wh ich factor s are influe ncing th e teratog enic pro cess.
Knowledge of the possible developmental stages that have incorporated an error can provide guidance in choosing appropriate times for collecting field samples for chemical analysis and guide researches in developing bioassays that mimic the timing of factors present in the field.
Careful characterization and categorization of malformations occurring in the frogs can provide clues to potential causes through comparison with similar malformations that have been produced in lab experiments.
Some of these laboratory experiments involving development date back as far as 1929 (Vogt).
However, associations based on morphologic evidence are circumstantial and without further field and lab analy ses, con clusions canno t be draw n rega rding th e cause s of ma lform ations.
To determine the causes of malformations, agents will need to be identified in the field at appropriate developmental times, and in the appropriate geographic locations in relation to occurrence of malformations.
The agents must be capab le of consiste ntly pro ducing com parab le lesions in ap prop riate spec ies of frogs .
Lab ex perim ents w ill need to take into consideration the role played by such variables as timing of exposure, dose and duration of exposure, and interactions between other environmental or host factors in the potential for producing the wide range of malfo rma tions seen in the field.
La borato ry resu lts will need to be repr oduc ible und er field con ditions.
6 III.
DEFINING THE PROBLEM The pathology of many of malformed frogs is obvious, the cause is not.
Syndromes like these ha ve not be en clear ly defined in frogs an d even the directio n to look fo r answ ers is unde r deba te. Thes e chan ges are not prod uced b y a sudd en and catastrop hic insult.
Malformations represent the end point in a developmental process that incorporated an error long befo re the ex ternal m anifestation of patholo gy. W hat are the errors in development and what questions can we ask to clarify the possible causes of these errors? A. M orph ogen esis Fro m the time an egg is fertilized , an intricate r elationsh ip exists betw een cells an d cell 14897-011 layers w hich giv es rise to ver y orga nized an d highly specialized tissues.
Th is proce ss is called morphogenesis.
Morphogenesis occurs through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death.
Cells divide and proliferate following well defined maps as they move and fold, becoming more differentiated and specialized.
As cell layers interrelate to each other they profoundly influence the growth and character of cells around them.
The timing of this intercellular communication is critical and is thought to be carried out primarily by chemical signals that affect gen etic expr ession.
In limb bud formation, the mesoderm carries all of the information needed to induce a limb as it interacts with the overlying ectoderm.
If the lateral mesodermal plate, represented in this figure, is su rgically tra nsplan ted onto the back of a tadpole, an entire limb will form in response to that committed mesoderm.
During later morphogenesis of the limb the mesoderm is responsible for directing bone formation and the ectoderm is responsible for prov iding the ce llular env ironm ent that allow s the limb to continu e to grow .
B. Malformation vs. Deformation If something goes wrong during morphogenesis and an error occurs in the sequence of cell division, cell migration, cell differentiation or programmed cell death, pathology is likely.
This pathology is called a malformation or a deformation.
Malformations represent primary errors in development; deformations arise later in development and usually result from mechanical factors.
Timing of the error or insult influences both the occurrence and the type of malformation produced.
And the appearance of the malformation can indicate timing.
For example, if the malfo rma tion is an inco mp lete orga n, the factor or insult m ust have occur red du ring a su sceptible p eriod p rior to com plete form ation of that o rgan to halting dev elopm ent. C. Teratog enesis Teratogenesis is simply the name given to the abnormal development that results in malformations.
These errors can involve any level of organ formation; cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programm ed cell death.
Teratogenesis can be caused by either genetic or environmental factors (intra-uterine factors in mammals).
Examples of environmental factors include radiation, hyperthermia, low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, poor nutrition and chemicals.
Factors or compounds causing malfo rma tions are c alled terato gens. 7 The same teratogen presented at different developmental ages can initiate different malformations.
However, different teratogens presented at the same developmental age can res ult in similar errors in develo pm ent caus ing the sam e ma lform ation.

FINDINGS A. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF FROGS WITH SIMILAR MALFORMATIONS Du ring July and S eptem ber 19 97, 93 r ecently m etam orph osed leo pard fr ogs w ere sub mitted to the Na tional W ildlife Health Center (NW HC) for diagnostic evaluation.
Frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune (12 abnormal and 6 norm al), Lap ans B ay (14 ab norm al and 6 n orm al), M issisquoi N W R (15 abnor mal an d 6 nor mal), M ud C reek (6 normals), Poultney River (21 abnormal and 7 normal) and shipped, alive, to the NWHC .
Diagnostic methods and proce dures are detailed in the study plan (A ppen dix B).
Necropsy evaluations did not reveal developmental abnormalities in the internal organs of the frogs, although there were renal flukes (most likely Echinostomatae) in various stages of development and inflammation of the cloaca was occasionally seen.
The most common primary abnormalities in these frogs involved the rear legs and examples of these limbs with radiographic detail of the bone changes provide information that assists in classification of the patholo gy as m alform ations or deform ations.
1.
Deformations a.
Trauma Ver y few frogs sub mitted w ere con vincing deform ities or traum a.
Aga in, defor mities ar e not prim ary err ors in development but structural abnormalities that can be caused by mechanical forces, trauma, infectious agents or inflammation.
Gross observations of northern leopard frog 14895-003 from Poultney River indicated a short femur on one side suggesting a malformation.
Radiographs, however, show us that the femur actually has a overriding fracture which is a deformity caused by trauma.
Although frog 14897-003 from Missisquoi is missing a limb, the changes in this limb are consistent with trauma and not a primary error in development.
Characteristic changes associated with trauma include an abrupt end to the leg associated with an irregular depre ssed cen ter and r ed, inflam ed, raised mar gins.
M icrosco pic examination of leg of the frog shown at right (14897-003) showed hem orrha ge, inflam matio n and ac ute necr osis of the sk eletal mu scle surro undin g the end of the fem ur. N o radio graph s wer e availab le from this frog as the limb w as section ed for m icrosco pic evalu ation.
14897-003 Two of the frogs (14896-008, 14897-003) were in fair body condition suggesting recent trauma.
Frogs 14897-013 and 14895-003 were in poor body condition suggesting a more chronic condition.

Am elia This fro g is missin g a limb .
This is a ver y early p rima ry erro r in deve lopm ent.
If we look at the radiograph of one of these frogs with amelia (below 14895-015) we see that not only is the right leg missing, but the right acetabulum (joint for the femur) of the hip also never developed and the two bones (ischium and pubis) are absent.
The hip and hip joint on the opposite side with a normal limb are unremarkable.
There is no evidence of inflammation, fractures or vestigial bones in the regions where the right leg should be.
The limb never developed.
14895-002 Where are the errors in development? The lateral mesodermal plate is responsible for the pelvic development as well as initiating the development of the rear limb.
The lateral mesodermal plate must have been present, as evidenced by the presence of at least a portion of the pelvis on the affected side.
However, there must have been a very early error because 2 of the 3 pelvic bones nev er developed.
A pparent lack of initiation of a limb also suggests an early primary error in the formation of the limb with either an error in the development of the apical ectodermal ridge or in communication between the mesoderm and ectode rm. Radiographs of three frogs with completely missing limbs showed two types of changes.
Two of the frogs radiographed were 14895-015 missing the ischium and the pubis of the pelvis only on the side witho ut the limb , as in the rad iograp h show n abov e.
The other ra diogra phed frog w ith ame lia had all of the p elvic elem ents pre sent.
Frogs with amelia were emaciated.

There is no swelling, redness, inflammation, or irregularity at the termination of these limbs.
There is no scarring and the pigm entation o ver the e nd of the lim b is norm al.
Radiographs of these limbs show no fractures in the segment of femu r that rem ains and the term ination is blun t. Frogs with hemimelia have truncated limbs but the proximal segment of limb that is present is relatively normal.
This is one of 2 types of bone changes seen radiographically in association with truncation of 14896-003 bone s (hem imelia).
If we look at these two radiographs, we see 14896-014 had an abrup t termin ation of the fe mu r witho ut bone reaction similar to that seen in 14896-003.
In the radiograph of 14895-013, however, the distal femur has very abnormal bone development at the end of the bon e with irr egular widen ing of the b one silho uette and increased lacy bone trabeculae traversing the marrow.
There is no attem pt at bone develo pm ent bey ond this ab norm al bone .
The bone changes in 14895-013 suggest that there was an error at the pro gress zo ne; w ith mes oderm al signals; or with comm unication between the ectoderm and mesoderm which eventually stopped growth but may not have stopped as abruptly as 14896-013 14896-014 in 14896-003.
The bone development apparently lost its control and became very irregular abnormal fashion in 14895-013 but it did continue to produce bone.
In 14896-003 and 014, we see no irregular bone growth at the termination, the bone just ends su ggesting a mo re abru pt halt to dev elopm ent.
Microscopically, the proliferative bone changes as seen in 14895-013 confirmed thick, partially ossified trabeculae traversing the marrow w ith irregular and thickened cortices whic h we re som etimes bent at the po int of abno rma l develop men t.

Abnor ma l feet or m issing digits (Ectrodactyly or Brachydactyly) Frog 14895-008 from Poultney River has a short limb and, although difficult to recognize, this disorg anized limb en ds with a structur e resem bling a foo t.
The radiog raph o f this frog sho ws tha t not only is the grow th abno rma l but differen tiation of the bo nes is abn orm al as we ll.
There appears to be abnormal development of the distal tibiafibula and there was 180/ rotation of the tibiafibula that resulted in the tibiale bone in a lateral position and the fibulare bone in medial location.
The tibiale and fibulare are short.
The digit positions are also reversed 180/ (they are aligned in the appropriate order relative to the tibiale and fibulare bones) and phalanges.
These malformations suggests an error in the mesoderm that may ed later in the develo pm ental sequ ence re sulting in ab norm al skeletal elem ents limb only.
14895-008 are missing have o ccurr in the distal 14895-008 Another example of abnormal development of the feet can be seen in the radiograph of frog 1489 5-18.

Th e tibiale and fibu lare bon es are ag ain shor t and cur ved an d there w as no fun ctional ho ck joint.
It is interesting that the mid-shaft of the tibiafibula is also abnormal suggesting that the insult to the bone that caused the error began earlier in bone formation with a more protracted effect than wou ld have been ap preciate d witho ut radiog raphs .

Rotation of long bones and skin webbing The radiograph of the Vermont frog shown (14895-010), although missing the distal limb on one side has rotation of the lower limb of the more normal leg with a bend in the bone that is traversed by a "bone bridge".
Rotational abnormalities in the Minnesota frogs were very common.
These rotational abnormalities involved the limb proximal to the hock causing the flexed hock to have either a dorsal or ventral orientation rather than pointing in the more normal medial direction.
Although there were no Vermont frogs with rotation as its primarily malformation rotations did occur in relation w ith other m alform ations an d did res emb le som e of the M inneso ta rotations .
Rotations were most likely to occur in frogs with ectrodactyly or brachydactyly (missing or shortened digits) suggesting that errors in the bone formation was occurring proximal to the affected d igits (4 frogs).
L imb r otation also occur red in tw o frogs with fem oral hem imelia of the opp osite limb and in the sa me lim b as tibiafibula r hem imelia in a nother frog.
It appeared that the more proximal the source of rotational abnormality (ie femur vs tibiafibula), the m ore sev erely the prope lling surfac e deviate d from the norm .

INTERPRETATION OF DATA Although the number of frogs submitted from each site was low, it seems important to look at the data to see if there was an association between malformation type and body condition.
The potential impact a particular abnormalities migh t have on frog suc cess, as re presen ted by ge neral bo dy con dition or n utritional statu s, migh t also be acc essible through data analysis.
Data from the field studies will be needed to determine if the malformations submitted from each site for this study were truly representative of the population in both malformation type and frequency of malfo rma tions pre sent.
Although data should be corrected for population variation due to site variables as well as for weight bias secondary to absence of body parts in particular abnormalities, I feel looking at the frog morphology data, as in this scatter diagram, could provide insight into the association between the type of abnormality in the frog and body condition of those frogs, represented by the frog's weight in relation to length.
The average body condition for all of the types of m alform ations w as poo r to em aciated w ith the exce ption of fro gs with amelia that were all very emaciated.
B. MO RP HO LO GIC FIN DIN GS IN F RO GS FRO M EA CH STU DY SITE : Malformations from Vermont were 93% reduction malformations (amelia, hemimelia or ectrodactyly).
Only 3 frogs submitted with malformations evaluated had an abnormality that did not involve truncation of a limb.
Of the 61 malformations, (4 were bilateral) 10% had no limb on one side, 40% involved abrupt termination of either the femur, tibiafibula or tibiale and fibu lare and 43% had loss o r trunca tion of the dig its.
13 Fro gs from Miss isquoi ha d the m ost com plete limb develo pm ent with truncatio ns involv ing the low er limb distal to the femur.
Frogs from Poultney River and Alburg Dune (although fewer number of total frogs were submitted from Alburg Dune) had the most severe truncations with the primary abnormalities involving apparent lack of any initiation of lim b (am elia) or trun cation of the limb at the fe mu r (fem oral hem imelia).
A verag e body condition in frogs from all of the study sites was poor to emaciated.
Frogs with no apparent malformations (controls) collected at the study sites also we re in poo r to fair bod y cond ition but the sa mp le size wa s too sm all to mak e an extr apolation to the overall population of leopard frogs at these sites.
This ch art of association of severity of malformation with site of collection might suggest errors occurring either at different developmental stages in frog development, or different dose or duration of exposure to a teratogen.

C. DETERMINATION OF BODY CONDITION Gen eral bod y cond ition assessm ent (goo d, fair, poo r, em aciated) p erform ed at nec ropsy seem ed to m ost accu rately reflect the nutritional status of malformed frogs.
This subjective assessment at necropsy was independent of the affect that the ab norm ality or frog size mig ht have had on weigh t. Wh en m ajor bo dy par ts of the frog were all present, body weight to body length ratios reflect nutrition status of frogs more accurately than body weight alone or snout to v ent length alone as a lar ge frog (length) m ay be em aciated an d have the sam e weig ht as a sm aller frog with good bod y fat stores.
For this study, it was assum ed that sex was not a factor in the body cond ition or size of these immature, recently metamorphosed frogs.
Frogs necropsied very close to the time of tail bud resorption (metamorphosis just completed) may still have fat reserves stored during the tadpole stage.
These frogs would not have experienced the survival pressures placed on a frog that had been required to actively capture food for a longer period of time and the fat stores in these recently metamorphosed frogs could be misleading if used as an indicator of succes s as a frog. 17 D. HISTOPATHOLOGY FINDINGS Histopathology was performed on 19 frogs (Appendix F).
Histopathology on malformed bones showed two general types of bone changes.
One of the characteristics of bone at the termination of the malformed limb was very disorganized and hyperplastic cartilage that was not ossifying normally and interfered with the formation of bone cortex.
The second type of bone change at the point of termination was the formation of small nests of endosteal type cartilage matrix with some organization but no obvious maturation or ossification.
None of the malformed limbs had inflammation and they often had very poor skeletal muscle development.
Traumatic amputations did have micr oscop ic eviden ce of skele tal mus cle necr osis and inflamm ation.
N o cons istent mic rosco pic chan ges w ere seen in internal organs (heart, lung, liver, stomach, intestine, pancreas, kidney, bladder, gonad, spleen, thyroid gland, thymus, lymphoid aggregates) that could be related to malformations.
The brain and spinal cord of the frogs submitted often had dilated ventricles and we are in the process of consulting with a neuropathologist to determine the significance of this finding.
E. RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS Radiographs were extremely helpful in determining the degree of malformation in the limbs as well as the type of termination in both long bones and digits.(Appendix D) Malformations of the hip were also seen in some of the Vermont frogs and these would not have been detected without the use of high detail radiography.
Radiographs were also helpful in differentiating trauma from m alformation, although necropsy observations and histopathology were also im portan t in ruling ou t traum a.
F. RESULTS OF MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING Lab tests were performed on the frogs sent into our lab so that information involving infectious agents could be looked at in relation to malformation types.
1.
Parasitology In an attempt and made an compared to hem imelia o r to look for significance of metacercariae in the frogs, parasitology examined the frogs, cleared them estimate of metacercarial load.
Metacercarial load in frogs from Vermont were relatively heavy, Minnesota frogs; the primary malformations in all Vermont sites were reduction defects such as trunca tion of a lim b wh ich has no t been disc ussed a s a direct seq uelae of m etacerc arial infection .
Parasitologic examination was performed on 14 frogs; with at least 1 normal frog from each site following procedure s outlined in the Study Plan (App endix C).
Skin, subcu taneous tissue, coelom, oral cavity, esophagu s, intestinal serosa, kidney, urinary bladder, fat body, heart/pericardium, and skeletal muscle from the rear leg, back, abdomen, tail bud area were examined for metacercaria.
Metacercariae were most consistently seen in the kidney, how ever this m etacerc aria w as mo rpho logically d istinct (mo st likely Ec hinosto mata e) from the me tacerca ria seen in other locations.
Skin, tail bud, liver, tissue adjacent to eyes, epaxial muscles were also common sites where meta cercar iae (mo st likely D iplostom atidae) w ere fou nd. Th e me tacerca riae table in Appendix H is organized by malformation and, although statistical analysis was not meaningful due to the small numbers, an association between metacercariae and malformation was not obvious.
Metacercariae were present in both normal and malform ed frogs.
Appendix H also contains a table for the adult helminths that were found in these frogs but these are listed for interest and are thought to be incidental findings as there was no pathology associated with these parasites.
18 The hip regio n of a clear ed frog pictured above show s three m etacerc ariae.
2.
Bacteriology: Cultures of liver and kidney from 30 abnormal frogs and 15 normal frogs (45 frogs) were conducted following the protocol outlined in the study plan (Appen dix C).
29 different bacteria were isolated and identified from these frog s; most of them were in the group Enterobacteriaceae and are not usually considered to be primary pathogens.
One important excep tion to this was Aero mon as hyd rophila which was most comm only isolated from frogs collected at Lap ans B ay. Aero mon as hyd rophila is a know n patho gen of am phibian s and re ptiles.
No ne of the fro gs with Aero mon as hyd rophila isolated had evidence of trauma.
The most common isolates from all sites were Alcaligenes xylosidans and Pseu dom onas c epacia and these bacteria were also isolated from norm al control frogs.
No isolates could b e related to malfo rma tions.
3.
Virology Attempts to isolate virus from livers, kidneys, hearts and occasionally skin sampled from 32 abnormal frogs and 19 normal frogs (51 frogs) followed the protocol for virus isolation outlined in the study plan.
No viruses were isolated or identified in negatively stained preparations for electron microscopic in any of the samples from any of the frogs in this study.

Many of these terms, defined in Appendix B, were originally used to describe defects that are present in the mamm alian fetus at birth.
Direct application of these terms to frogs that metamorphose in a free-living postembryonic state may or may not prove to be appropriate.
However, common terminology may allow recognition of similar conditions by individuals in related specialties involving developmental anomalies across species and bring new interest and collaboration to the issues involving malformed frogs.
The terminology in reference to possible points of error in development (mesodermal versus ectodermal) may be simplistic, but allows an initial attempt at looking at the pathogene sis of some of these malform ations.
Case num ber : National Wildlife Health Center (NW HC) reference number given to a group of frogs submitted from the same site and usually collected in a similar time frame.
Accession number : NW HC reference number given to individual frogs within a case.
Body condition (as defined for this report by M eteyer): Bod y cond ition reflects the nutritiona l state of the frog and is determined by the pathologist by subjective assessment of relative quantity of muscle and body fat present in the frog at the time of necropsy.
Assessment of body condition is independent of absolute weight or snout to vent length.
Body condition has been scored in the following w ay so that averages can be m ade for com parison betwee n sites and abnorm alities; good = 4, fair= 3, poor = 2, em aciated= 1. Good body condition: Ad equate skeletal muscle and abu ndant fat in the fat bodies.
Fair body co ndition: Adequate skeletal mu scle with reduced fat in the fat bodies.
Poor bod y condition: Adequ ate skeletal muscle with scant or no body fat in the fat bodies.
Em aciated body condition: Ske letal muscle wasting and no b ody fat in the fat bodies.
W eight to length ratio (as defined for this report by Meteyer): The weight (gm) of the frog divided by the length (cm) of the snout to vent length of the frog which provides an approxim ation of nutritional status or body con dition as a numerical index value which correlates with body condition as assessed at necropsy.
M orph ogen esis : Developmental process which gives rise to highly organized and specialized tissues through cell division and proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death.
Path ogen esis : Cellular events, reactions and other pathologic m echanisms oc curring in the developm ent of disease M esoderm : The embryonic layer from which connective tissue, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood, vasculature, notochord, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, kidney, and gonads are derived.
Ectoderm : The embryonic layer from which epidermal tissues (skin, hair, etc.), mucous membranes, nervous tissue, and extern al sense or gans (ey e, ear, etc.) ar e derive d. Malformations: Primary errors in any phase of morphogenesis including cell proliferation, cell migration, differen tiation, pro gram med cell death or regres sion of larv al structur es.

In the fall of 1996, abnormalities in northern leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont.
Incidences of abnormal leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR ) on October 9, 1996.
The incidence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed).
Several of the sites where deformities were observed were near the borders of the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Swanton, Vermont.
Most of the abnormalities observed were missing legs or feet, but also included eye abnormalities.
Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two C anadia n prov inces.
T he m ost exten sive w ork to da te has bee n cond ucted in M inneso ta and in the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec.
The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring have not been identified, however, the predominant theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases.
The purpose of this investigation is to take the first steps in examining the abnormalities in the Vermont frogs.
Specifically, this investigation will examine affected frogs from four sites in Vermont, catalogue the external and internal abnormalities, and compare to frogs of an unaffected site in Vermont, as well as abnormal frogs collected from M inneso ta in 1995 and 19 96.
Se lect sam ples w ill be exam ined for virolog y, bacter iology, an d para sitology.
T he ove rall information should verify whether the frogs in Vermont have developmental abnormalities, whether the abnormalities observed in Vermont are the same as those observed in Minnesota, and to begin to determine whether viruses, bacteria, and/or parasites could be respo nsible for the abnorm alities.
Purpo se The purposes of this investigation are several fold: (1) to determine whether the abnormalities observed in northern leopard frogs in Vermont are developmental in nature; (2) to compare abnormal frogs to normal-appearing frogs collected from an expe cted con trol site to verify that there ar e differen ces; (3) to com pare ab norm alities found in Ver mo nt to abnormalities found in Minnesota to determine if they are the same phenomenon; and (4) to determine if a subsample of frogs h arbor viruses, b acteria, or parasites w hich co uld be re spons ible for the ab norm alities obser ved in V erm ont.

The majority of deformities have involved multiple, fused, or missing hind limbs, however, some recently reported developmental deformities have also included vestigial tails, missing, misplaced or sup ernum erary eyes and ossification abnorm alities
(R. Brann ian, National W ildlife Health Center, pers. com m., 19 97; J. H elgen, M inneso ta Pollution Con trol Ag ency, p ers. com m., 19 97).
The causes of the rise in amphibian deformities remain unclear, however, a number of hypotheses are presently being researched including: xenobiotic chemicals, parasites, and UV-B light.
Some researchers have indicated that classifying the types of abnorm alities on a site will be helpful in isolating the causal agent or agents (C. M eteyer, NW HC , pers. com m., 19 97).
In 1997, 19 sites in the Lake Champlain Basin in Vermont were surveyed for frog deformities.
Rates greater than three percent were observed at 17 of the sites.
Rates overall ranged from 0-45% and averaged approximately 8% (R. Levey, State of Vermont, pers. comm., 1997).
A BRD Quick Initiative Grant of $8000 awarded to this project allowed the National Wildlife Health Center to conduct a workup of the abnormal frogs collected in Vermont.
The workup included classification of abno rma lities, histopatho logy, ne crops y, virolo gy, bac teriology , and par asitology .
The re sults of this wor k sugg ested that the re wa s no cor relation b etwee n viruse s, bacteria , or para sites and the frog abn orm alities obser ved in Vermont (C. M eteyer, NWH C, pers. comm., 1997).
What the work did not include, due to insufficient funds, was skeletal analysis through radiology.
This additional work should clarify whether the abnormalities observed are deform ities, caused by traum a or disea se, or m alform ations, cau sed by a disfunctio n in deve lopm ent. Th e wo rk sho uld also serve to diagnose any skeletal abnormalities not externally observable.
Objective : To determine through radiology of frogs collected in Vermont in 1997 whether the abnormalities observed are developmental in nature or trauma induced, as well as to diagnose skeletal abnormalities not externally observable.
Exp ected P rodu cts : A written report of the project findings will be prepared.
The work will be presented at professional meetings and will be incorporated into peer-reviewed literature.

Background and Justification: In the fall of 1996, deformities in northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were observed by the public at 12 sites adjacent to Lake Champlain in Vermont.
Several sites were near the border of the Missisquoi NWR in Swanton, Vermont.
The presence of deformed leopard frogs were verified at four of these sites by staff of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VTDEC) on October 9, 1996.
The prevalence of deformities averaged 16.5 %, ranging from 5-23 % at the four sites (230 frogs observed).
Most of the frogs observed had missing legs or feet and some had eye abnormalities.
Similar observations have been made in at least seven states and two Canadian provinces.
The most extensive surveys and identification of deformities in frogs and environmental sampling to date has been conduced in Minnesota and the St. Lawrence Valley of Quebec.The mechanism(s) by which these deformities are occurring has not been identified; however, the popular theories include: UV-B radiation; xenobiotic contaminants; and viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic diseases.
The purpose of this investigation is to take a first step by completing a clinical examination of deformed frogs collected from four sites in Vermont to complete the following objectives: Objectives: 1.
2.
3.
4.
Characterize and catalog the external and internal deformities in leopard frogs in Vermont; Compare deformed frogs to normal-appearing frogs from an expected control site; Compare morphometric descriptions of abnormalities in Vermont leopard frogs to abnormalities confirmed in Minnesota frogs to determine whether any similarities exist; and Determine the presence or absence of viruses, bacteria, or parasites in deformed frogs.
frogs breed are identified in the recent Vermont reptile and on 12 of these sites; VTDEC staff confirmed the frog deformities be collected from each of the 40 sites.
Four sites with at least this study.
Fifteen abnormal-appearing frogs will be collected frogs will be collected from a control site where no deformities Methods and approach: Forty site where northern leopard amphibian atlas (Andrews, 1995). ).
In 1996, deformed frogs were observed by the public on four of these sites in 1996.
A least 100 frogs will 10% of the frogs appearing abnormal will be selected for from each of these four sites and five normal-appearing were present in a sample of at least 50 frogs.
Recently metamorphosed frogs will be collected and examined for the presence and type of deformities.
Frogs with deformities will be placed in 11 x 32 cm plastic boxes with lids containing 1 air-hole/inch in a chilled cooler or shady location.
Approximately 3 cm of water from the site will be placed in the boxes along with sphagnum moss.
At the completion of frog collection, the plastic boxes will be placed in hard-sided coolers, surrounded on four sides with frozen blue ice containers.
The boxes will be held in place by a washable metal frame.
Eight frogs will be placed live in each container and shipped via overnight service to the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC).
Upon arrival, frogs will be examined to deter ermine how the frog responds to this abnormality, photographed, the deformities will be characterized and cataloged using nomenclature and morphologic diagrams developed at NWHC based on frogs submitted to NWHC, photographs by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA, Helgen), and a Quebec study (Ouellet, 1997).
Routine histopathological and microbiological samples will be collected and processed on a subset of tissues.
Catalogued data will be used to compare abnormalities in Vermont frogs to those recorded during 1995 and 1996 Minnesota frogs.
Tissue samples or whole frogs will be archived for later use if funding becomes available or a potential agent causing the deformities is identified.
Characterization of abnormalities and Necropsy Examination 1.
Describe clinical condition/function or movement of any deformed limbs, multiple limbs or other grossly apparent deformities..
2.
3.
Photograph abnormalities before the frog is anesthetized or euthanized if possible.
Euthanize one frog at a time using inhalation of Halothane (see NWHC SOP).
4.
Necropsy will be performed with the use of a dissecting scope and 2X head loop.
Frogs are opened with an ventral midline incision.
The heart is collected and a blood smear made.
Tissues for virology will be placed in viral transport media, tissues for bacteriology in vials of broth and tissue for histopathology in formalin.
Very small tissues will be places in embedding bags in formalin.
27 5.
Necropsy set-up and lab distribution of frogs is as follows: Sites 1-4 Case #'s 14895 - 14898 Accessions 001-005, Pathology: 2 blood smears Multiple tissues in formalin and embedding bag Tissues for bacteriology, virology Accessions 006-007, Parasitology: Description of gross pathology Submit whole carcasses in whirl-paks, in saline Accessions 008-010, Virology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues in viral transport media Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 011-013, Bacteriology: Description of gross pathology Blood smear Submit tissues bact broth vial Carcass saved in formalin jar - Hold Accessions 014-015, Hold Frozen: Description of gross pathology Freeze back in whirl-paks Normals, Case # 14899 Accession 001: Pathology (necropsy as above) Accessions 002-003: Virology (necropsy as above) Accessions 004-005: Bacteriology (necropsy as above) Virology 1.
Virus isolation will be attempted in amphibian and fish cell culture.
Liver, spleen, kidney, gut and heart were pooled by like tissues (liver with livers, spleen with spleens) with a maximum of three frogs per pool.
2.
Viral isolates will be identified and characterized.
3.
Electron microscopy will be performed on the pooled tissues in an attempt to detect any viruses that cannot be isolated in cell culture.
Bacteriology Frog tissues consisting primarily of liver, heart, kidney and others will be placed directly into appropriately labeled tubes of tryptic soy broth (TSB) at necropsy and submitted to diagnostic bacteriology.
The following procedure will be followed: 1.
The 10 ml tubes of TSB with tissue will be vortexes for 5-10 seconds and subcultured immediately onto blood agar (BAP), eosine-methylene blue agar (EMB), (or MacConkey agar), Lowenstein-Jensen agar (LJ), sabouraud-dextrose agar (SAB), thioglycollate broth (THIO), and cooked-meat broth (CM).
2.
Media (except LJ and SAB) will be examined at 18-24 hour intervals for up to 72 hours before being discarded as negative.
Positive cultures will be subcultured and identified to at least genus level.
TSB will be subcultured after 24 hours if growth appears.
LJ and SAB will be held as appropriate until sufficient growth develops or there is no growth.
3.
Identification of bacterial isolates will be consistent with current capabilities and will include the use of commercial identification systems; predominately the API system, bioMerieux Vitex, St. Louis, Missouri.
Reference laboratories, primarily the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa will be used as needed.
Parasitology To determine the presence and species of parasites or evidence of parasite infections, live or freshly euthanized frogs will be sent to the parasitology laboratory for examination under a dissection scope.
The following procedures will be followed: 1.
Frogs will be skinned and the muscles and fascia examined under the dissecting microscope.
will be teased apart and examined for metacercaria.
Hind limb muscles 2.
Metacercaria in the subdermal layers will be dissected free and placed temporarily in Ã¯Â¿Â½ strength Locke's solution and refrigerated.
In some cases, this will cause the metacercaria to encyst so that fixation and staining can proceed.
Notes will be kept and vial labeled as to collection site for the metacercaria.
3.
A ventral incision will be made from vent to lower mandible to expose internal organs.
28 4.
The heart will be removed and a blood smear made according to DPL SOP. 5.
All organs will be examined grossly, any parasites removed, prepped for fixation and fixed in AFA or 70% depending on the class of parasite.
Most organs are small enough to examine via a squash preparation.
Fat bodies will be examined via squash preparation for mesocercariae.
6.
The body cavity will be examined for immature helminths.
If found they will be removed, relaxed and fixed.
7.
Eviscerated carcasses will be placed in 10% buffered formalin and later cleared according to Hanken ans Wassersug (1981).
Following clearing frogs will be examined and the presence or absence of metacercaria noted.
