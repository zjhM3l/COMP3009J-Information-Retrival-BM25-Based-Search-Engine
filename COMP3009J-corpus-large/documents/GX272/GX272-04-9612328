III-51 PURPOSE OF THIS MANUAL This manual provides an overview of the pollution prevention and recycling options that are available in the textile industry.
This report is intended only to assist the user in his or her preliminary research and development of pollution prevention options.
Each company is responsible for identifying, evaluating, and implementing pollution prevention options that are appropriate to its specific situation.
By compiling and distributing this manual, EPA and SEMARNAP are not recommending the use of any particular processes, raw materials, products, or techniques in any particular industrial setting.
Compliance with U.S. and Mexican environmental laws, occupational health and safety laws, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations is the responsibility of each individual business; however, this is not the focus of this document.
The information in this manual is intended to be a comprehensive overview of the documented information on pollution prevention and recycling practices for the textile industry.
However, the collection, organization, and dissemination of pollution prevention information is a relatively new initiative, and an ongoing process.
In addition, there are limits to any manual, including this one.
Therefore, this summary may not contain every relevant piece of information on pollution prevention and recycling for textile and apparel manufacturing firms.
EPA encourages all users who discover, in the literature or in the industry, pollution prevention options that are not cited in this report, to share this information with EPA.
Please submit any corrections, updates, or comments on this report to the following: Robert D. Lawrence (6EN-XP) Pollution Prevention Coordinator U.S. EPA Region 6 1445 Ross Avenue Dallas, TX 75202 (214) 665-2258 This manual is an assimilation of existing research and case studies of pollution prevention and recycling options.
Because of the voluminous amount of such information, referencing sources in the text as they are used would make the manual cumbersome for the reader.
Therefore, the authors of this manual wish to acknowledge the authors of all documents referenced in the bibliography section, which were used to compose the manual.
INTRODUCTION Production of economically competitive products is the driving force behind any successful business.
Production frequently requires the use of various chemicals throughout the manufacturing process.
The purchase and storage of these chemicals, their use in the process, and the ultimate disposal of the waste generated by the manufacturing process can present many challenges.
Such challenges involve disposal costs, waste management, and worker health and safety.
Pollution prevention provides an effective means of minimizing, and even eliminating, such challenges.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines pollution prevention (also referred to as source reduction) as the use of materials, processes, or practices that reduce or eliminate the generation of pollutants or wastes at the source.
It includes practices that reduce the use of hazardous and nonhazardous materials, energy, water, and other resources, in addition to practices that protect natural resources through conservation or more efficient use.
Because of the enormous potential for pollution prevention along the U.S.-Mexico border, the Pollution Prevention W ork Group was established in February 1992.
The lead federal agencies of the W ork Group are EPA and Secretaria Del Medio Ambiente Recursos Naturales y Pesca (SEMARNAP).
EPA and SEMARNAP began promoting and coordinating the reduction of pollution through a broad range of approaches: technical assistance, training, public and private sector programs in pollution prevention awareness, assessment of pollution prevention options, policy development and institutional support, and technology development and investment activities.
The purpose of this manual is to provide pollution prevention information for the textile industry.
This manual is the fourth in a series of industry-specific pollution prevention manuals.
"W aste Minimization for the Metal Finishing Industry," "Pollution Prevention for the W ood Finishing Industry," and "Pollution Prevention in the Electronics Industry" were the first three in a series of bilingual pollution prevention manuals prepared jointly by EPA and SEMARNAP.
Future manuals will include other industries that are typical in the border area.
This manual contains the following sections: Section I Goals and Benefits of Pollution Prevention This section defines the term "pollution prevention," and provides an overview of the goals and benefits of, and the methods of developing, a successful pollution prevention program.
Section II General Pollution Common Practices Prevention Options and This section discusses general pollution prevention options and common practices that are applicable industry-wide.
Section III Industry Pollution Prevention Options in the Textile This section describes various processes and waste streams associated with the textile industry and pollution prevention options for each process associated with that industry.
Section IV Case Studies This section includes specific examples of companies that have used pollution prevention techniques.
These case studies describe the benefits, particularly cost savings, that these companies have derived.
Glossary Bibliography Appendix Additional Sources of Information The Appendix lists additional technical documents pertaining to pollution prevention options for the textile industry, and other pertinent information.
These documents are currently available only in English.

SECTION I GOALS AND BENEFITS OF POLLUTION PREVENTION SECTION I GOALS AND BENEFITS OF POLLUTION PREVENTION WHAT IS POLLUTION PREVENTION? Pollution prevention (P2) (also known as source reduction) is the act of eliminating the pollutant before it is generated.
The purpose is to prevent pollution from being generated rather than determine how to control pollution or manage waste after it has already been generated.
P2 is a philosophy that prevents or reduces pollution at the source through cost-effective changes in design and production.
It includes practices that reduce the use of hazardous and nonhazardous materials, energy, water, and other resources, in addition to practices that protect natural resources through conservation or use that is more efficient.
Such changes (1) offer industry substantial savings in reduced raw materials, pollution control, and liability costs, (2) protect the environment, and (3) reduce risks to worker health and safety.
Moreover, P2 is more than just another way of reducing pollution.
P2 is a philosophy.
This philosophy continually searches for innovative ways to do things and to overcome the inherent human resistance to change.
Such a philosophy does not accept "that is how we have always done it" as a rationale for maintaining a policy or practice.
Source reduction eliminates the pollutant before it is generated.
Source reduction strategies include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Make raw material changes by substituting raw materials that are less hazardous for process chemicals that generate waste.
Introduce process modifications that increase efficiency and reduce or eliminate the amount of waste generated.
Promote good operating practices that reduce waste, such as inventory control to eliminate the accumulation of unused or expired chemicals, and preventative maintenance to eliminate leaks and spills.
On-site recycling and reuse is also considered to be a form of P2, because post-processing materials, which would normally be disposed of, are reintroduced into the generating process.
This not only extends the life of the waste raw material but minimizes the introduction of additional raw material into the process.
A variation of this is to recycle the waste raw material into another useful application, thereby eliminating disposal.
Although they may not always be considered P2 in the strictest sense, recycling and reuse strategies are discussed in this manual.
Figure I-1 presents various methods of source reduction and recycle/reuse strategies.
Table I-1 summarizes specific examples of source reduction options.
TABLE I-1 EXAMPLES OF SOURCE REDUCTION OPTIONS Raw material changes Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Purchase raw materials that are free of trace quantities of hazardous impurities.
Switch to nonmetallic dyes and synthetic sizes.
In wet processing of fabric, use auxiliary agents that are less hazardous.
Process modifications and new technologies Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Redesign equipment and piping to reduce the volume of material contained, thereby reducing losses during batch or color changes, or when equipment is drained for maintenance or cleaning.
Change to mechanical finishing of fabrics to avoid using chemicals.
Use an alternative wet processing technology, such as supercritical carbon dioxide.
Use ultrafiltration to recover valuable sizing chemicals and dyes.
Use volume displacement to minimize chemical and water use in dyebaths.
Use foam processing technologies in fabric dyeing, printing, and final finishing operations.
Improved operating practices Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Properly train equipment operators.
Screen incoming substrates and chemicals for hazardous impurities.
Segregate waste streams to avoid cross contaminating hazardous and nonhazardous materials.
Increase control of operating conditions (including flow rate, temperature, pressure, residence time, and stoichiometry), and change maintenance scheduling or procedures to increase efficiency.
Optimize purchasing and inventory maintenance methods for input materials.
Reevaluate shelf life standards to avoid unnecessary disposal of stable items.
Prevent leaks, drips, and spills, and use drip pans and splash guards.
Place equipment in a manner that will minimize spills and losses during transport of parts or materials.
Reuse or recycle rinse water, process water, and wastewater from wet processing operations.
Note: The opportunities presented here are P2 options because they prevent pollution from being generated or reduce the pollution that is generated.
OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES Numerous pollution control or waste management strategies are applied only after wastes have been generated.
Therefore, they are not correctly categorized as P2.
Table I-2 provides examples of waste management strategies that are not categorized as P2.
Many waste management practices used to date have merely collected pollutants and moved them from one environmental medium to another.
Companies should recognize that transferring hazardous wastes to another environmental medium is not P2.
For example, solvents can be removed from wastewater by using activated carbon.
However, regenerating the activated carbon requires using another solvent or heating, which transfers the contaminants to the air.
In some cases, this type of waste management strategy is a valid treatment option.
However, the result has often been to shift a pollutant to a medium that is regulated less stringently.
For example, waste treatment prior to disposal reduces the toxicity and/or disposal-site space requirements but does not eliminate all pollutant materials.
Frequently, the effect is to transfer pollution from air or water to land.
Conventional waste treatments include processes such as volume reduction, dilution, detoxification, incineration, and stabilization.
Off-site recycling, which is another waste management strategy, is vastly preferable to other forms of off-site waste handling, because it helps to preserve raw materials and reduce the amount of material that will require disposal.
However, off-site recycling is likely to result in more residual waste that requires disposal than with closed-loop recycling (reuse) performed at the production site.
Furthermore, waste transportation and off-site recycling increase the risk of worker exposure and release to the environment.
The waste management hierarchy (Figure I-2) presents P2 options (source reduction and recycling/reuse) and pollution control measures (treatment and disposal), in priority order from top to bottom, from the most environmentally beneficial to the least environmentally beneficial.
Section III of this manual contains specific technical information on P2 options for the textile industry.
POLLUTION PREVENTION GOALS The goal of a P2 program is to improve the quality of the environment by preventing waste from being generated--or reducing the waste that is generated--at the source.
Pollution prevention includes any action by a company to reduce the amount of waste generated by a manufacturing process prior to off-site recycling, treatment, or disposal of the waste.
To effectively accomplish this, the program must include an ongoing, comprehensive assessment of the operations at a facility.
BENEFITS OF A POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM Businesses have strong incentives to reduce the toxicity and volume of the waste that they generate.
As P2 options lower operating costs, production costs will decrease.
Therefore, companies with an effective, ongoing P2 program will have a significant competitive advantage.
TABLE I-2 WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT ARE NOT POLLUTION PREVENTION Off-site recycling Ã¯Â¿Â½ Off-site recycling (for example, solvent recovery at a central distillation facility) can be an excellent waste management strategy.
However, because it is not re-introduced into the generating system or used as an alternative material or product, it is not a P2 measure.
Waste treatment Ã¯Â¿Â½ W aste treatment involves changing the form or composition of a waste stream to reduce the amount of, or eliminate, the pollutants.
However, they do not affect the pollutants until after they have already been generated.
Examples include wastewater pretreatment, detoxification, filtration, incineration, biodegradation, stabilization, and solidification.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ W aste treatment technologies are generally "end-of-pipe" approaches to pollution.
Many waste treatment technologies that have been used have only collected pollutants and moved them from one environmental medium (air, water, or land) to another.
For example, activated carbon filters may prevent air pollution, but they can a create a solid waste problem.
Concentration of hazardous constituents to reduce volume Ã¯Â¿Â½ Volume reduction operations, such as dewatering, are useful waste treatment approaches, but they do not prevent pollution or reduce the amount of pollutants being generated.
The following subsections discuss the benefits that can be gained from a P2 program, as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Reduce operating costs.
Protect human health and environmental quality.
Improve employee morale and participation.
Enhance the company's image in the community.
Assist in compliance with environmental laws.
Reduce Operating Costs An effective P2 program can yield cost savings that will more than offset program development, implementation, and operational costs.
Cost reductions may be immediate savings that appear directly on the balance sheet or anticipated savings that are based on avoiding potential future costs.
Cost savings are particularly noticeable when the costs resulting from the treatment, storage, or disposal of wastes are allocated to the production unit, product, or service that produces the waste.
Materials costs, or the costs of purchasing materials, can be reduced by adopting production and packaging procedures that consume fewer resources.
This approach uses resources more efficiently, and reduces the quantity of waste generated.
As wastes are reduced, the percentage of raw materials converted to finished products increases.
This results in a proportional decrease in materials costs.
W aste management and disposal costs may be reduced when less waste is produced.
Required procedures for proper handling of the waste at the facility--in addition to specific treatment, disposal, and transportation methods--are typically labor-intensive and very costly.
These requirements and their associated costs are expected to increase.
Production costs can be reduced through a P2 assessment.
W hen people examine production processes from a P2 perspective, they find opportunities for increasing efficiency that might not, otherwise, have been noticed.
Production scheduling, material handling, inventory control, and equipment maintenance are areas in which facilities can work to reduce the production of waste of all types, thereby controlling the costs of production.
Energy and water usage costs will decrease as the facility implements P2 measures in various production lines.
In addition, by thoroughly assessing how operations interact, companies can reduce the energy and process water used to operate the entire facility.
Protect Human Health and Environmental Quality Reducing the release of pollutants to air, land, and water will protect the environment and human health.
Releases typically containing harmful pollutants that can be reduced significantly by P2 options include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Air emissions, including solvent fumes, fine particulates, and carbon monoxide Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Land disposal, including ash from incineration, waste solvents, and debris W ater disposal, including wastewater contaminated with solvents and other toxic materials Releases from process operations, including leaks and spills Poor ventilation, mishandling of chemicals, and a lack of proper safety equipment can affect the health and safety of employees.
An informative employee training program is an important way to reduce accidents.
Reducing the amount of chemical materials and wastes at a facility is also beneficial, because it reduces the amount of space required for storage and the potential for accidental spills.
Furthermore, reducing the volume of waste generated minimizes the amount of solid and hazardous waste that requires transport and disposal.
Improve Employee Morale and Participation Employees are likely to feel better about their company when they believe that management is committed to providing a safe work environment and is acting as a responsible member of the community.
By participating in P2 activities, employees have an opportunity to be part of a "team," and interact positively with coworkers and management.
Helping to implement and maintain a P2 program will typically increase each employee's sense of commitment to company goals.
This positive atmosphere helps a company to retain a competitive work force and to attract high-quality new employees.
Enhance the Company's Image in the Community The quality of the environment has become an issue of critical importance to society.
Your company's policy and practices for controlling waste increasingly influence the attitudes of the local community towards industry.
Community attitudes are more positive toward companies that operate P2 programs and publicize them.
If a company creates environmentally compatible products, and avoids excessive use of material and energy resources, the company's image will be enhanced both in the community and with potential customers and consumers.
Assist in Compliance w ith Environmental Law s Enforcement of Mexico's environmental laws includes administrative penalties that entitle government inspectors to require temporary or permanent closure of businesses that are not in environmental compliance.
By implementing and following a P2 program, a company increases its chances of avoiding violations and associated penalties.
DEVELOPING A POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM Keys to a Successful Program The following characteristics are crucial to the success of a P2 program: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Support from top management Champions--personnel who actively promote the program W ritten mission statement backed by company policy Defined and measurable goals Solicitation of, and follow-up on, employees' suggestions Continuous reevaluation as economic conditions and/or the manufacturing processes change Any effective and enduring program--including P2--must have the support of top management.
Executives and managers set the tone for the P2 program.
To build and sustain a successful program, companies need to integrate P2 into their business practices.
As production-level employees see a company-wide commitment, they will be more likely to support the program.
This is crucial, because they will be the most active personnel in both identifying P2 opportunities and in implementing solutions.
The company should write a P2 mission statement to emphasize its commitment to the program.
Next, a company should organize a P2 team that includes managers, supervisors, and line workers.
From the beginning, the team should involve those who are knowledgeable about the processes that generate wastes.
Recognize those who contribute, and continually encourage suggestions from all employees.
Designate one or more P2 champions from the team.
Champions are assigned to overcome resistance to the program and obstacles to change.
The champions should be high-profile employees that are respected and trusted by their coworkers.
The P2 team should write a plan that details (1) methods of encouraging participation, (2) stipulations for employee training, (3) procedures for conducting process assessments, and (4) criteria for implementing P2 projects.
If management is not on the P2 team, the plan should be presented to, and agreed to by, management.
This plan will be a starting blueprint for the program, but it should be updated whenever necessary, because a company should continually strive to improve the program.
After the company has established the general organization of the program, the team must establish goals for the program.
The team may want to establish both an ultimate goal and one or more short-term goals--for example, reducing waste by 10 percent annually.
Goals can be revised.
Build on the successes achieved, and update your company's goals.
P2 is a continuous process.
Throughout the process, employee suggestions must be actively encouraged and seriously considered.
Suggestions should be evaluated quickly and, if they meet the designated criteria, put into practice.
If you choose not to implement a particular suggestion, explain your reasons to the employee who suggested it.
Reinforce the importance of each individual's contributions and their value to the overall company objectives.
The Pollution Prevention Process The process (Figure I-3) can be divided into the following basic steps: 1.
Characterize the production process.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
Assess waste streams.
Identify P2 options.
Evaluate the economic and product quality implications of each option.
Choose and implement the best options.
Measure results.
Reevaluate the program.
To complete steps 1 and 2, you must collect information about your facility.
Collect as much information as you need, but remember to keep your data collection system as simple as possible.
The information gathered will help to focus the efforts during the ensuing phases of the program.
Possible sources of useful information include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Regulatory information Ã¯Â¿Â½ Permits W aste shipment manifests Emission inventories Engineering information Process flow diagrams Operating manuals Equipment lists Material balances Ã¯Â¿Â½ Production data Production schedules Product and raw material inventories Material safety data sheets Raw material use efficiency Ã¯Â¿Â½ Accounting data Costs of handling and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste Product, energy, and raw material costs Operating and maintenance costs Under step 3, members of the P2 team and other employees will identify many options.
Encourage creative and independent thinking, and use brainstorming sessions.
Many other options--and information useful in evaluating options--can be obtained through (1) trade associations, (2) published literature, (3) other companies, (4) government agencies, (5) equipment suppliers, and (6) technical consultants.
The Appendix presents some sources of information.
Under step 4, identify and document the benefits and costs associated with each project.
Benefits and costs may be economic, technical, or environmental.
After the options have been evaluated, the P2 team can choose the options that meet the company's criteria for technical and economic feasibility (step 5).
Some projects may be beneficial for reasons other than P2.
For example, some options may improve economic competitiveness or increase employee safety.
Options that do not involve a large capital expenditure--such as procedural or housekeeping changes--can be implemented quickly after the appropriate reviews and approvals have been obtained.
The other approved projects may be implemented as soon as it is technically and economically possible.
Under step 6, compare your achievements to the goals that were established for the program.
How much waste has been reduced? W hat costs or savings have resulted? How has the product quality been affected? Under step 7, the P2 program is periodically reevaluated to identify ways to improve and adapt it to changes in industry processes and in the regulatory environment.
Sustaining the Program Maintaining a successful P2 program cycle after cycle is challenging but can provide large dividends for a company.
For example, such a program can achieve the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Lower material and disposal costs incrementally.
Focus employees on continuous improvement.
Reinforce a positive view of the company with its employees and within the community.
Following are suggestions for maintaining the momentum of a P2 program: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Reemphasize the economic benefits to employees and management.
Publicize success stories, and reward innovation.
Hold operating units accountable for the full costs of controlling and disposing of any waste that they generate.
Rotate the members of the P2 team to sustain an inflow of fresh ideas.
Provide updated training.
SECTION II GENERAL POLLUTION PREVENTION OPTIONS AND COMMON PRACTICES SECTION II GENERAL POLLUTION PREVENTION OPTIONS AND COMMON PRACTICES IMPACT OF POLLUTION PREVENTION ON COMPANY EXPENSES This section presents various P2 options that can be applied industry-wide.
P2 can improve worker health and safety, and increase the profitability of the business.
In the simplest form, a company's finances may be calculated as follows: Profit = Income - Expenses P2 can decrease two major expenses: raw material costs and the cost of waste disposal.
Reducing the amount of waste generated decreases the waste that requires disposal.
W astes often consist of potential product that has been squandered.
For example, a finishing material, such as paint, that ends up on the floor instead of on the product is a purchased raw material that could have been sold as part of a finished product.
On the floor, it is merely a waste.
Not only is that wasted finishing material never sold as part of a product, but it will cost money to clean up and dispose of; also, regardless of whether your company is in the U.S. or Mexico, the cost of disposal is expected to continue to increase.
On the other hand, if your company used equipment that applied paint with less overspray, less paint would be wasted, and the company would need to purchase less paint, thereby decreasing raw material and disposal costs.
DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT Design for Environment (DfE) aims to minimize environmental impacts and use resources efficiently.
The aim of DfE is to promote sustainable development.
Simply stated, sustainable development consists of meeting the needs of the current population without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
DfE considers the environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycle, including raw material acquisition; processing; manufacturing and assembly; product use, service, and repair; retirement; and treatment and disposal.
A life-cycle assessment is conducted to gain an understanding of these impacts.
A life-cycle assessment includes three phases of analysis: (1) inventory, (2) impact, and (3) improvement.
During the inventory analysis, all energy and raw material requirements, emissions to air and water, solid wastes, and other releases are quantified for the product throughout its entire life cycle.
During the impact analysis, the effects of the resource requirements and wastes generated are qualitatively and/or quantitatively assessed.
The improvement analysis evaluates the opportunities to reduce the environmental impact on the production, use, and retirement of the product.
This assessment naturally leads into product design and DfE.
Therefore, environmental considerations should be included as design criteria, as are legal, cultural, performance, and cost criteria.
Design objectives that minimize environmental impact include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use recycled or renewable sources of raw material.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Design a product to be more energy efficient.
Make a product with a longer useful life.
Increase reliability Simplify maintenance Increase durability Design for adaptability Plan for product remanufacture or reuse Ã¯Â¿Â½ Make a product that is easier to recycle or that, when disposed of, has less environmental impact.
different products.
For example, in the electronics extending the useful life of a product might involve adaptable.
However, for the textile industry, an would be to make carpeting or a piece of apparel These types of objectives take different forms for industry--in which technology changes rapidly-- making a computer more easily upgradable or example of extending the useful life of a product more durable.
HOUSEKEEPING Housekeeping efforts are often the first attempt that a facility makes to minimize waste.
This is to be expected, because such efforts often require relatively low capital commitment and are often perceived as simple common sense solutions.
However, these types of changes are often peoplebased, rather than technology-based, and can be more difficult to maintain over the long term.
The best manner in which to implement effective housekeeping changes is to make it easy for employees to do the right thing.
Facilitating segregation of waste streams is a common housekeeping measure that can make the difference between reclamation and disposal.
W hen a waste is mixed with other wastes, it loses much of its reuse potential and value.
Rather than allowing wastes to become mixed with other wastes, companies should capture wastes in their concentrated forms, thereby facilitating their reuse.
Separation of unit process rinse and wash waters, process wastewaters, and fiber wastes from different machines is especially important in managing waste streams in the textile industry.
However, many of these process streams may resist recovery options that use standard equipment.
Other housekeeping changes may include spill and leak prevention, contamination control, and equipment maintenance.
INVENTORY CONTROL Properly controlling raw materials, intermediate products, final products, and wastes is a significant way to minimize pollution.
W astes may consist of either raw materials that are out of date, no longer used, or unnecessary; or final products that are off-specification or damaged.
Including wastes in an inventory program can make them more recoverable.
Improving inventory control ranges from simple modifications in the procedure of ordering materials to just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing techniques.
Improved inventory control can reduce material expenses and reduce the waste that is generated, and its associated costs.
The following changes can improve your inventory management: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Purchase only the amount of material needed.
Review materials for hazardous content, and examine alternatives that are less hazardous.
Track and control the use of materials to reduce excess use.
Designate specific employees or departments as responsible for the purchase and disposition of supplies and materials.
REDUCE PACKAGING WASTE Packaging can (1) protect a product during transportation, (2) make handling easier, and (3) provide information about a product.
However, packaging is often a significant component of a company's solid waste stream.
W here practical, the easiest way to reduce packaging waste is to ship a product without packaging.
However, some packaging is often required.
In this case, the following options can minimize its environmental impact: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Reduce the amount of packaging used.
Reconfigure the packaging so that products can be transported more efficiently.
Use reusable packaging.
Use packaging that is composed of materials that are more biodegradable.
Use recycled materials in packaging.
The amount of packaging required for each unit of product can be reduced by shipping in bulk and changing the amount of protection that the packaging provides.
The packaging may be determined to be excessive and provide more protection than the product needs.
Perhaps the product can be modified to require less packaging.
A more sturdy product may require less packaging and may better serve the customer.
W holesale and intermediate products can often be shipped in reusable containers.
Tanks, wire baskets, wooden shooks, and plastic boxes are often used as reusable containers.
Procedures for collecting and returning, and for storing and handling, reusable containers may prevent them from being discarded.
Finally, the impact of packaging on the environment may be reduced by using materials that are more biodegradable or using packaging that contains a high content of recycled material.
Some inks and pigments now available for use in package labeling are less harmful than those traditionally used, but they are just as effective for most applications.
Examples of recycling textile packaging include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Specify burlap bale wraps or Tyvek bale covers instead of polypropylene, which is not easily recycled.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sell used cardboard tubes and cones back to the suppliers.
Reuse intact cardboard tubes directly, and reuse damaged tubes by salvaging shorter pieces from longer damaged tubes, such as cutting the damaged end from a 60-inch tube for use as a 48-inch tube.
Incinerate broken pallets to recover their fuel value.
Recycle pallets as pallets.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ ESTABLISH AN ON-SITE RECYCLING PROGRAM Section III will identify on-site recycling options for each textile process.
Although on-site recycling is not source reduction, it can be a relatively easy way to reduce waste and costs simultaneously.
Onsite recycling reduces a company's overall waste stream.
A smaller waste stream can (1) require fewer garbage collections, (2) enable the company to rent a smaller Dumpster, and (3) reduce the costs of the ultimate destruction or disposal of the waste.
Recycled materials may be (1) purchased by a recycler, (2) collected without charge, or (3) collected for a charge.
This depends on the materials being recycled and the local market.
Implementing a recycling program involves four basic steps: (1) analyze your company's waste stream, (2) identify recycling opportunities in your area, (3) negotiate a contract with a recycler, and (4) design a recyclables collection program.
First, analyze your company's waste stream.
Identify the materials that you may want to separate for recycling, such as solvents, scrap metal, paper, or cardboard.
Second, identify recycling opportunities in your area.
To be a candidate for recycling, a material must have a market.
That is, someone must be able to use the old materials in new products.
Call recyclers to ask the following questions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ W hat materials are recycled locally? How are materials collected and processed? How much is paid or charged for picking up different recyclables? Third, negotiate a contract with a recycler.
Traditionally, recycling markets have had frequent changes in the amount paid per pound of material.
It is important to find a reliable company that will weather the market fluctuations.
Ideally, a company will accept a wide range of materials so that you will have the option to expand the recycling program.
Fourth, design a recyclables collection program.
For a company to obtain maximum value, it must separate a recycled material from the waste stream and, usually, from other recycled materials.
For a collection program to be successful, employees must be able to easily participate in it.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Place recycling containers in convenient locations.
Clearly label containers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Place waste baskets near the recycling containers so that recyclables are not contaminated.
If your company's area does not have a recycler that will accept a specific waste, there are still several options.
One alternative is to talk with other companies in your area.
Perhaps a nearby company could use your company's waste.
If a nearby company has the same waste, you may be able to combine your wastes with its for a sufficient quantity to make it attractive to a recycling company.
Another option is to contact a waste exchange.
Over 50 waste exchanges are operating in North America.
W aste exchanges help companies generating waste to find possible markets for the waste.
The Resource Exchange Network for Eliminating Waste--located in Austin, Texas--helps companies throughout the southwest United States and northern Mexico ([512] 239-3171).
In 1994, U.S. textile manufacturers recycled about 65 percent of their wastes, including metals, fiber waste, carding waste, assorted rags, fabric waste, plastic, metal dye drums, and wood pallets-- thereby significantly reducing the amount of solid waste that would normally be disposed of in landfills.
SECTION III POLLUTION PREVENTION IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY SECTION III POLLUTION PREVENTION IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY Introduction The main purpose of this section is to present practical P2 options for the textile industry.
Chapter 1 of this section presents a brief overview of the textile industry, textile products, textile processes, and associated waste streams.
Chapter 2 discusses P2 options--source reduction (raw material changes, process modifications, and improved operating practices) and recycling/reuse strategies-- for individual textile processes.
Many of these P2 options can save money for a company, and decrease waste.
Section IV, Case Studies, provides examples of companies that have developed a P2 program and implemented P2 strategies.
Chapter 1 THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY Overview of the Textile Industry In almost every developing nation, textile manufacturing is among the first industries to be established.
In 1994, the textile production was a $70 billion industry that employed nearly 670,000 textile workers and over 900,000 apparel workers.
The Maquiladora textile and apparel industry is growing stronger every year, with plants now expanding further south into Mexico, beyond the U.S.-Mexico border.
Currently, about 345 maquiladoras, or about 16 percent of all maquiladora industries, are involved in some facet of the textile and apparel industry, including the fabrication of apparel, carpeting, automobile accessories, and household goods.
Markets for textiles are most frequently divided into (1) apparel; (2) domestic--household items, such as towels and bed coverings; and (3) industrial--automotive components, such as tire cord, filters, carpet, and upholstery; and (4) recreational equipment, such as backpacks and parachutes.
Textile facilities range from small family-owned operations that use older traditional manufacturing processes to large integrated mills that operate the most modern textile machinery and equipment.
Textile establishments are engaged in receiving and preparing fibers; transforming fibers into yarn, thread, or webbing; converting the yarn into fabric or related products; and dyeing and finishing these materials at various stages of production.
The process of converting raw fibers into apparel and nonapparel textile products is complex, and most textile mills are specialized.
In the U.S., a notable exception is the more than 300 integrated mills that combine spinning and weaving in their operations.
However, even these large integrated mills do not normally conduct their own finishing operations.
This requires a relatively extensive textile finishing industry that comprises over 700 finishing and dyeing mills.
Textile Processes Because there is such a diverse product and application range of textiles, the type of processing used is highly variable and depends on site-specific manufacturing practices, in addition to the type of fiber used, and the final physical and chemical properties that are desired.
Even for a constant product type, no two textile mills use exactly the same methods of production.
Textile manufacturing begins with the production or harvesting of raw fiber.
After the raw natural or manufactured fibers have been shipped from the chemical plant or the farm, they pass through the following processing stages: (1) yarn formation, (2) fabric formation, (3) fabric preparation, (4) dyeing, (5) printing (6) final finishing, and (7) product fabrication.
Raw fiber is formed into yarn (Process 1), which is spun or woven into fabric, or greige goods (Process 2); the fabric then undergoes various "wet" processing (Processes 3, 4, 5, and 6).
Each of the wet processes--fabric preparation, dyeing, printing, and final finishing--is followed by a drying step.
Some of the processes may be omitted, and the order of the operations may vary, depending upon the particular end-product that is desired.
These processes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.
To simplify process descriptions and more effectively organize the associated P2 strategies, this manual will follow a generic sequence of minimum processing steps, as shown on Figure III-1.
The common equipment set-ups used for textile processes shown on Figure III-1 include batch, continuous, and semicontinuous.
In batch set-ups, a fixed amount of substrate (cloth or yarn) is placed in the machine, chemical solution is added, and processing proceeds.
After the reaction is complete, substrate is removed, and chemical solutions are discharged, or reused if feasible, with any subsequent auxiliary processes (rinsing and washing) occurring in the same vessel.
In continuous systems, chemical solution is added to the machine, and fabric is moved through it without interruption.
Semicontinuous systems are a combination of batch and continuous set-ups.
Because batch systems inherently tend to generate more waste than continuous systems, batch systems are generally used for treating (dyeing) small quantities of a particular type of product, whereas continuous systems are more amenable to processing large yardages of product.
Textile Process Waste Streams The textile industry is energy-, water-, and chemical-intensive.
W ithin the industry, the majority of energy, water, and chemicals consumed is for wet processing.
Most wet processing involves treatment with chemical baths, which often require washing, rinsing, and drying steps between key treatment steps.
Consequently, wastewater is generated, having a very diverse range of contaminants that must be treated prior to disposal (Table III-1); energy is consumed to (1) heat and cool chemical baths and washwater, and (2) dry fabrics or yarns.
Because of the quantity and toxicity of generated wastewater, the industry has faced increasing pressure regarding environmental and waste-related concerns.
The industry has significantly reduced the waste generated by (1) making equipment changes, (2) on-site recycling, and (3) implementing nonprocess-related measures, such as housekeeping, in addition to research and development activities that are centered on cleaner technology.
Textile manufacturing is one of the largest producers of wastewater; about 20 gallons of water are required to produce 1 pound of textile, on the average.
Textile manufacturing is also a chemicallyintensive industry and, therefore, the wastewater from textile processing operations contains processing bath residues from preparation, dyeing, slashing, and various other operations.
Many processes in textile mills produce atmospheric emissions.
Air emissions from chemical finishes, dyeing process residues, and assembly/fabrication residues can include formaldehyde and amine.
Other air emission sources may include (1) solvent-based cleaning activities (facility cleanup, maintenance, parts cleaning, and print screen cleaning), (2) wastewater treatment systems (mixed liquor and spent processing baths with dye carriers and solvent scours), (3) warehouses (formaldehyde emissions from stored fabric), and (4) spills.
Pollutants may include mineral oil, knitting oils, fiber finishes, softeners, hydrocarbons, urea, and volatile disperse dye carrier components that are desorbed from the fabric during subsequent heatsetting, drying, and curing.
Chapter 2 POLLUTION PREVENTION OPTIONS FOR THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY Organization of this Chapter Section I introduced a waste management hierarchy.
The preferable option is source reduction, which consists of decreasing the amount of waste generated at the source, then recycling or reusing the material, followed by treating the waste and, ultimately, disposing of it.
Although recycling is not necessarily a method of P2, some aspects of recycling are covered in this section.
Recent developments in the textile industry are providing opportunities for more recycling and reuse of process water and chemicals.
Furthermore, interest in media other than water, such as solvents and foams, for chemical application is increasing.
Accordingly, the industry is finding that, beyond meeting regulations, the potential economic gain through reduction of treatment costs and wasted resources is significant.
Overall changes in the textile production infrastructure are likely, such as integrating automation into many aspects of production, from dyebath chemical analysis and reuse to garment fabrication.
An essential aspect of automation is demand-activated manufacturing, or quick response (QR).
An example is coloring preassembled items to order rather than carrying a large inventory.
Increased vertical integration of individual functions is also desired, as closely coupled manufacturing processes tend to maximize energy and water efficiency, chemical recovery, and production rate.
In the future, synergistic relationships will be identified between different industries, and facilities will be built in close geographical proximity to strive for complete closed-loop systems.
In its efforts to improve operation, the textile industry has reached out into other sectors of the research community.
The American Textiles Initiative, which is a cooperative research agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy (national research laboratories) and numerous organizations from the textile industry and academic sectors, has facilitated collaborative research, incorporating P2 and waste minimization technology, in many aspects of textile manufacturing that are important in enhancing the global competiveness of U.S. textiles.
In 1991, the American Textiles Manufacturers Institute launched the Encouraging Environmental Excellence (E3) initiative with the goal of expanding environmental awareness in the textile industry.
The E3 initiative challenges participating companies to strengthen environmental efforts and promote environmental stewardship as everyone's responsibility.
E3 promotes a proactive attitude regarding the environment with a goal of exceeding government requirements.
As a bonus, participating companies are beginning to reap economic benefits through reduced costs and an increased interest in their products from an increasingly environment-conscious public.
The program is also attracting the attention of customers.
Mail order giant L.L. Bean has expressed an interest in products containing materials manufactured by E3 member companies, and NationsBank has requested a list of E3 companies.
E3 is monitored by a seven-member advisory board of academicians and environmentalists to provide an objective view.
In this chapter, each textile process--(1) yarn formation, (2) fabric formation, (3) fabric preparation, (4) dyeing, (5) printing, (6) final finishing, and (7) product fabrication--and its associated waste streams will be discussed briefly, followed by a more detailed discussion of P2 options.
P2 options are organized into source reduction and recycle/reuse strategies.
Source reduction is further organized into discussions of input material changes, process modifications/new technologies, and improved operating practices.
PROCESS 1--YARN FORMATION Fiber used in textiles can be (1) harvested from natural sources (for example, wool and cotton), (2) manufactured from regenerative cellulosic materials (for example, rayon and acetate), or (3) be entirely synthetic (for example, polyester and nylon).
In yarn production, natural fibers, predominantly cotton and wool, are cleaned, blended, carded and/or combed, drawn, drafted, and then spun into yarn.
Man-made cellulosic and synthetic fibers are often shipped as staple, which are ready for spinning, or as continuous filament yarn, which may be used directly or following further shaping or texturizing.
Unlike cotton and man-made fibers, raw wool must be cleaned by wet processes before the fiber can be dry-processed to produce yarn or fabric.
The wool is scoured to remove waste impurities-- such as natural secretions, dirt, and other residues--and then dried.
Spun yarns are made by loosely gathering natural fibers, man-made fibers, or blends into a rope-like form, drawing them out to increase fiber alignment, and then applying twist.
The most common spinning system in use today is ring spinning.
In this system, the spinning machine drafts the input form (roving) to the necessary dimensions, inserts twist, and forms the yarn, which is wound on a spinning bobbin.
The rate of front roll feed and the spindle speed determine the amount of twist.
Spinning provides spun yarns with their natural integrity and strength.
Texturizing increases the apparent volume of continuous filament yarns so that their appearance more closely resembles that of conventional (natural) spun yarns.
Numerous processes can be used for yarn texturizing, including torsional crimping, edge crimping, compressions crimping, and air texturizing.
Natural fiber contaminants include (1) natural waxes and oils, (2) metals, (3) agricultural residues, and (4) lubricant residues arising from harvesting and processing.
Synthetic fibers can contain impurities, such as finishes, polymer synthesis by-products, and processing additives, which are imparted to the fibers during fiber manufacturing and before they reach the textile manufacturer.
W astes associated with spinning include (1) fiber waste, resulting from cleaning and other operations, and (2) packaging wastes.
Additives--such as tints, antistatics, and lubricants--that are applied during spinning, as well as some natural fiber contaminants, may become a waste as they are removed during subsequent wet processing operations.
Source Reduction PROCESS MODIFICATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES Spinning New spinning equipment focuses on open-end or rotor spinning, which (1) produces four to five times the output of ring spinning, and (2) integrates roving, spinning, and winding into one operation.
Open-end or rotor spinning is significantly different from ring spinning in that the spinning operations are performed directly on drawn sliver, which eliminates roving.
In this process, the staple fibers in the form of a sliver are fragmented as they are fed into a small spinning centrifugal mechanism.
W ithin this mechanism, the fibers are oriented and discharged in yarn form, with twisting being added through the rotation of the rotor.
This system can process fibers of varying lengths and use waste material that is unsuitable for conventional ring spinning.
New open-end spinning frames can produce yarns routinely at 250 to 300 feet per minute (fpm).
Open-end spinning consumes less energy than does ring spinning for heavier yarns, because roving is eliminated.
Air-jet spinning has also generated great interest because of the high speeds and quality output of this system.
Air-jet yarns have limited applications.
The system is particularly suited to synthetic fibers and blends that have a minimum acceptable length and a very high-bending modulus.
Air-jet spinning of 100 percent cotton is very difficult but not impossible.
Air-jet spinning does not require lapping, combing, and roving.
New air-jet spinning equipment promises to deliver output of as high as 600 fpm.
Modern equipment has also dramatically reduced the number of steps needed to convert baled fiber into yarn.
By increasing process efficiency, less raw material is wasted.
Air-jet spinning production costs are consistently higher than rotor production costs.
More energy is needed for the air compressor and the higher production speed.
Texturizing Recently in Great Britain, a new steam texturizing system was developed (Figure III-2).
This system provides a textured yarn with consistent dyeing properties, thereby eliminating a large volume of waste that is generated by current processes.
Current technology calls for an entire machine of over 200 positions to operate in the same conditions at each position and produce yarn identically from position to position.
Consequently, dyeability of the yarn may vary because the yarn texturizing input is inconsistent.
The new system nonisothermally adjusts--in closed loop--the heat flux take-up by the yarn in tension to a specific dyeability.
The new technique allows compensation for the effects of yarn tension and shrinkage variation in a supply package during texturizing.
This method allows variation of texturizing in a single position.
The system has a steam supply for the texturizing heater, which provides a rapidly adjustable heat-flux to the yarn.
Variations are controlled by the signal generated by the unit's yarn-speed sensor.
W hen the sensor detects a yarn-speed change, steam conditions are altered to reverse the yarn-speed change while maintaining the requisite degree of texturizing.
The system permits a constant level of heat transfer (heat flux) to the yarn, which, in turn, permits short thread lines to be incorporated.
The inherent reduction in surging offers the possibility of higher processing speeds than current large machines.
The additional appeal of consistent dyeability means more efficient use of dyestuffs and less waste during the dyeing process.
Air-jet technology is being introduced to the texturizing process.
Texturizing with air-jet crimpers is replacing mechanical false-twist texturizing.
The new technology can texture yarn at over 3,000 fpm.
IMPROVED OPERATING PRACTICES Quality Control (QC) for Incoming Fiber Standard fiber-extractable tests are available for testing incoming fiber for the presence of oils, fats, waxes, metals, enzymes, solvents, and other impurities and residues from prior handling.
During processing, these contaminants are released into the water and air as pollutants.
Because of the massive amounts of fiber used in textile manufacturing, even trace amounts of contaminants can accumulate to become large pollutant loads.
Studies have shown that elevated metal concentrations in processing wastewater are attributable to incoming fibers that are contaminated with metals.
In another case, pentachlorophenol, which is a parasitic organochlorine pesticide applied to sheep, was detected at levels of as high as 100 ppm in consumer products, such as carpets.
To avoid using contaminated fibers, it is important to conduct proper raw material prescreening (see Case Study No. 5).
This requires a global P2 approach not usually seen in the textile industry.
The spinning mill should perform the incoming QC step to eliminate contaminants in the effluent of the finishing mill or in the finished consumer product.
Recycling and Reuse Zinc Viscose Rayon Manufacturing Over 50 million pounds of zinc sulfate are used annually in the U.S. in the manufacture of about 1 billion pounds of viscose rayon.
Zinc is used as a regeneration retardant in the acid spinning bath.
Because it is not consumed in any of the viscose reactions, these 50 million pounds of zinc represent process losses, through dragout by the filaments to the subsequent wash streams, filter backwashing, splashes, leaks, and the washing of equipment.
Zinc has traditionally been precipitated from the acid waste streams with lime, but the resultant sludge has been of low zinc assay, contaminated with other compounds and with very poor settling characteristics.
America Enka Company has developed a process for precipitating a dense sludge of high zinc assay, recovering the zinc, and recycling it into the rayon manufacturing plant, with no ill effects on the rayon yarn.
The key to recovering the zinc is a two-stage precipitation that occurs under careful pH control, by using sodium hydroxide in contact with a circulating slurry of zinc hydroxide crystals.
All of the zinc precipitates in the second step, and most of the impurities (iron, calcium, sulfate) precipitate in the first.
Acid and alkaline waste streams are collected in a neutralization tank, in which sufficient lime is added to raise the pH to 6.0.
At this point, no zinc hydroxide will precipitate, but a portion of the impurities will form a light precipitate.
W ith a coagulant aid, the remaining mixture is sent to a clarifier, in which a clear overflow containing the dissolved zinc is obtained.
The clear overflow is contacted in a reactor with a circulating stream of previously precipitated sludge that contains zinc hydroxide.
Subsequently, the pH is raised to 9.5 to 10.0 with sodium hydroxide.
The bulk of the zinc precipitates onto the existing crystals in the circulating slurry.
At steady state conditions, a withdrawal of the circulating slurry stream is made equivalent to the zinc being added, and this dense sludge is then settled.
The settled sludge of 4 to 7 percent zinc assay is converted back to zinc sulfate with sulfuric acid and is then sent back to the spinning bath.
The zinc content of the overflow water from the densator-reactor is set by the pH-solubility relationship of zinc in water and results in a zinc content of 0.5 to 1.0 ppm at a pH of 10.
Countercurrent Rinsing and Washing of Wool Countercurrent rinsing and washing involves the recycling, reuse, and reclamation of wool wastewater.
Effluent from the first washing bath is centrifuged to recover suint and to partially recycle wash water.
Rather than being discharged to a holding pond, bottom residual water containing mud and heavy grease is subjected to further treatment, which consists of a multipleeffect evaporation to concentrate the grease.
W ater condensate is reused in washing and rinsing.
Grease concentrate is vacuum-dried to produce a combustible residue (oil distillate and bitumen) for the evaporation boiler.
Rather than being discharged to the public sewer, rinse water in reused in the washing process.
Liquid wastes are completely eliminated with this low-waste technology.
By implementing this process, a textile manufacturer in France--having a production capacity of 18,500 metric tons of wool per year--decreased water consumption by nearly 75 percent.
Recycling Fiber Waste Reworkable fiber waste of 5 percent is typical in spinning operations, and can be reclaimed by reintroducing it back into the opening line through a waste hopper.
PROCESS 2--FABRIC FORMATION Textile fabrics are formed mainly by weaving or knitting processes.
Broadwoven mills consume the largest portion of textile fiber and produce the raw textile material from which most textile products are made.
Knit fabrics are used largely in the hosiery and sock markets, for the manufacture of underwear, lingerie, and outerwear, such as knit sport shirts.
Yarns are also used directly in the production of floor coverings.
Narrow wovens, waddings, nonwovens, and rope and cordage are used mainly in industrial applications.
Before the actual weaving operation, the yarn must be prepared by one or more of the following operations: winding, spooling, warping, and/or slashing.
The purpose of these operations is to transfer the yarn from the type of package that resulted from the spinning or texturizing operation onto a type that is suitable for fabric manufacturing.
Slashing (1) consolidates the proper number of warp yarns on the warp beam for the fabric construction, (2) coats the yarn with a protective coating, or size--usually starch or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)--for strengthening, and (3) dries the yarn in preparation for the weaving operation.
As part of the fabric preparation step, the desizing operation removes size from the fabric after the weaving operation has been completed.
In preparation for knitting, the yarn is lubricated to increase the speed and ease of the knitting operation.
This step may be accomplished in the knitting mill or during yarn formation (spinning or texturizing).
Sizes serve only a transitory need for weaving, resulting in the use and disposal of huge quantities of warp size by the textile manufacturing industry each year.
In the U.S., consumption is estimated at about 200 million pounds per year.
Size types include (1) natural starch, (2) fully synthetic products, such as PVA, polyvinyl acetate, and polyester, and (3) semisynthetic products, such as modified starches, starch esters, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC).
Starch accounts for the majority of all size chemicals used in the U.S.
A major problem with starch size is that it cannot be reused or recycled because the starch degrades to various sugars during desizing.
Starch size can contribute up to 50 percent of the total biological oxygen demand (BOD) loading from processing of woven fabrics.
A slashing operation must look beyond weaving performance to the desizing operation and pollution generated by size at that stage.
A global attitude concerning size is required for because the size will probably be removed at another location or mill during wet processing of fabric.
Desizing and associated P2 strategies are discussed under Fabric Preparation, which is next process step.
the P2, the the Source Reduction INPUT MATERIAL CHANGES Synthetic Sizes Two significant gains in pollution reduction result from choosing synthetic sizes that have (1) lower BOD levels, and (2) the ability to be recycled and reused.
The combination of moving from starch to a synthetic that can be reused can reduce BOD output by nearly 100 percent.
Synthetic sizes are not degraded by the removal process; therefore, synthetics can be recovered for reuse as a sizing agent.
Currently, new sizing chemicals are being developed using a technique called Interpenetrating Polymer Network.
Each polymer consists of numerous monomers that must react with each other to form the polymer.
This new technique allows molecules, that under normal conditions do not react with each other, to coexist in the same polymer.
The result is a hybrid polymer that has the characteristics of both monomers.
The ideal size is a polymer that provides high weaving efficiency and dissolves readily in water.
Sizes that can be removed in cold water and permanent sizes that can also function as dyesites are also being developed.
PROCESS MODIFICATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES High-Pressure Squeezing (Slashing) Several systems are presently available for new slashers or as a retrofit, including high-pressure squeeze rolls and modified size boxes.
The high-pressure system provides higher slashing speeds and better size penetration.
The new system is able to remove more moisture from the warp yarns before they pass over the dryer cans, thereby reducing the drying energy requirements.
The savings gained in drying energy requirements compensate for the increased electrical energy that is required to produce the higher roll pressures.
The main disadvantage is a decrease in size migration to the surface, thereby causing a flattening effect on the yarn.
Shuttleless Looms Traditional fly-shuttle looms are rapidly being phased out and replaced with modern shuttleless looms.
In shuttleless weaving, the filling yarn is inserted by air, water, or a special metal projectile that replaces the conventional shuttle.
Compared to conventional shuttle looms, shuttleless looms (1) operate at three times the rate, (2) are quieter, and (3) require less floor space per unit of production.
This translates into lower energy usage and more efficient production.
Shuttleless looms currently produce about one-half of all woven fabric output.
Shuttleless loom technologies include rapier, projectile, water-jet, and air-jet looms.
Needleless Knitting A 28-cut knitting machine uses about 6,000 needles having an average life span of about 6 months.
Needle replacement costs can run as high as $15,000 per year per machine.
Conventional knitting machines require lubrication with knitting oils, which must be disposed of upon exhaustion.
Pneumatic knitting without needles is accomplished by yarn-feeding air nozzles and ejector nozzles of a circumferentially perforated cylinder, which open and close intermittently.
Synchronized with this action is a yarn-feed system that intermittently feeds yarn to the yarn-supply jets in lengths that correspond to the loop size.
Productivity is improved, and yarn breakage is rare.
The installed cost of a typical ULLR jet with a 30000-pound-per-week capacity is about $1 million (high capital cost).
BASF's Multiplus NB-100 is an acrylate polymer that is designed to increase liquor pick-up in difficult textile systems, such as low-liquor-ratio coloration of cellulosics, acid dyeing of nylon carpet, and acrylic coloration.
The product is stable to acids, alkalis, and electrolytes, and offers increased wet pick-up, better use of dye, increased equipment flexibility, and greater process uniformity.
NB100 also provides excellent lubricity to the dyeing system, which allows ease of loading in jet machines without surfactants, thereby eliminating the need for silicone-based defoamers.
Running marks, such as crack marks and crows' feet, are eliminated via added lubricity.
Pad-Batch Dyeing
Padding: Application of a liquor or paste to textiles either by passing the material through a bath and, subsequently, through squeeze rollers, or by passing it between squeeze rollers, the bottom one of which carries the liquor or paste (a pad or padder) Paddle Dyeing Machine: A machine that is used for dyeing garments, hosiery, and other small pieces that are packaged loosely in mesh bags; the unit consists of an open tank and revolving paddles that circulate the bags in the dyebath Permanent Finish: Fabric treatments, of various kinds, designed to improve glaze, hand, or performance of fabrics; these finishes are durable during laundering PET (Polyethylene terephthalate): Polyester Picking: (1) A process that continues the opening and cleaning of staple and forms a continuous fiber sheet (or lap), which is delivered to the card; and (2) the operation of passing the filling through the warp shed during weaving GLOSSARY Pile: (1) A fabric effect that is formed by introducing tufts, loops, or other erect yarns on all or part of the fabric surface; types of pile are warp, filling, and knotted pile, or loops that are produced by weaving an extra set of yarns over wires that are then drawn out of the fabric.
Plain wires leave uncut loops: wires with a razor-like blade produce a cut pile surface.
Pile fabric may also be made by producing a double-cloth structure woven face to face, with an extra set of yarn being interlaced with each cloth alternately.
The two fabrics are cut apart by a traversing knife, thereby producing two fabrics with a cut pile surface.
Pile should not be confused with nap.
Corduroys are another type of pile fabric, where long filling floats on the surface are slit, causing the pile to stand erect.
(2) In carpets, pile refers to the face yarn, as opposed to the backing or support yarn.
Pile carpets are produced by either tufting or weaving.
Plying: Twisting together two or more single yarns or ply yarns to form, respectively, ply yarn or cord Polyester: A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer that is composed of at least 85 percent by weight of an ester of dihydric alcohol and terephthalic acid Printing: A process for producing a pattern on yarns, warp, fabric, or carpet by any of numerous printing methods; the color or other treating material, usually in the form of a paste, is deposited onto the fabric, which is then usually treated with steam, heat, or chemicals for fixation Print Paste: The mixture of gum or thickener, dye, and appropriate chemicals used in printing fabrics; viscosity varies with the types of printing equipment, the type of cloth, the degree of penetration desired, and other factors PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol): Synthetic size that is used in the sizing process in manufacturing cotton fabric Raw Fiber: A textile fiber in its natural state, such as silk "in the gum" and cotton as it comes from the bale Rayon: A generic name for man-made fibers, monofilaments, and continuous filaments, that are made from regenerated cellulose; fibers produced by both viscose and cupra-ammonium processes are classified as rayon Reactive Dyes: Dyes that react chemically with the fiber Reed: A narrow, movable frame that is fitted with wooden or metal strips that separate the warp threads Resin: A chemical finish that is used to impart a property desired in a fabric, such as water repellency file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 41 of 65 Retardants: Chemicals that are typically applied to fabrics or fibers to retard burning or other unwanted conditions Rheology: Study of the deformation and flow characteristics of printing pastes GLOSSARY Rope Soaper: A piece of equipment that is used for scouring fabric to remove impurities, such as processing oils and excess dye Roving: (1) In spun yarn production, an intermediate state between the sliver and the yarn; roving is a condensed sliver that has been drafted, twisted, doubled, and redoubled.
The product of the first roving operation is sometimes called slubbing; (2) the operation that produces roving (see [1]) Saturator: A box that is used to impregnate fabric with chemicals in a continuous range Scouring: Removal of foreign components from textiles; normal scouring materials are alkalis (such as soda ash) or trisodium phosphate, frequently used in the presence of a surfactant; textile materials are sometimes scoured by using a solvent Selvage: The narrow edge of the woven fabric that runs parallel to the warp; to prevent it from raveling, the manufacturer makes it with stronger yarns in a tighter construction than the body of the fabric; a fast selvage encloses all or part of the picks, and a selvage is not fast when the filling threads are cut at the fabric edge after every pick Shuttle: A boat-shaped device, usually made of wood with a metal tip, that carries the filling yarns through the shed in the weaving process; it is the most common weft-insertion device.
The shuttle holds a quill, on which the filling yarn is wound Singeing: Passing the cloth across an open gas flame at a high speed to burn off the loose surface fibers Sizing: Applying starch, PVA, or CMC to warp
Fiber-reactive dyeing of cotton and other cellulosics cannot achieve the high fixation level of other fibers, which--in wool and synthetics--typically range from 90 percent up.
During application, some unfixed hydrolyzed reactive dye remains in the fiber to be washed off, which requires substantial amounts of water.
An alternative is to limit the amount of washing and then fix the remaining dye.
Several new cationic polymeric fixing agents are available; these agents are more efficient with fiber-reactive dyes than the standard agent--formaldehyde.
Hoechst Celanese has developed the Remazol fiber reactive dye line for cellulosics, which is based on vinyl sulphone chemistry.
Incorporating di- and tri-anchors on the core chromophores can increase the fixation rate to the 95 to 98 percent range.
As the number of reactive sites on a single dye molecule increases, so does the probability that one will become attached to a cellulose hydroxyl group rather than become hydrolyzed, which is the common fate of many reactive dye groups in the basic fixation media.
Improved fixation reactives, such as those with Remazol, result in less unreacted and hydrolyzed (degraded) dye in the spent bath and wash water, which improves reuse opportunities.
Hoechst Celanese is also developing new dyes that would allow drastic reductions in the concentrations of sodium chloride required to exhaust the colorants before fixation.
To reduce the toxicity (metal content) of spent dye bath and wash water, Ciba-Geigy Company has reduced the metal content in its Cibacron reactive dyes.
Ciba-Geigy's bifunctional reactive dyes yield color fixation rates of 95 percent, which reduces dye usage, auxiliary salt consumption, and the volume of dyes in wastewater.
Yellow F-4G and Blue F-GFN, both of which are free of copper, have been introduced to achieve, in combination, bright green shades on 100 percent cotton fabrics, especially knits that are currently based on copper-containing turquoise and green colorants.
High-temperature reactive dyes, such as Imperial Chemical Industries' (ICI) Procion, allow for simultaneous application of disperse and reactive dyes, resulting in (1) a reduction in energy use, and (2) the elimination of the caustic bath required after disperse dyeing.
These new dyes, which arose from flame retardant research, contain phosphorous acid or phosphoric functional groups that form a covalent bond with the cellulose on reaction.
Major characteristics include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ They are unaffected by water in any form.
They function best under mildly acidic conditions.
Relatively high temperatures are required for fixation.
ICI's Procion T/Dispersol T system is designed for simultaneous dye application to polyester/cotton blends in continuous ranges.
This variety of reactive dye shades has many advantages over conventional low-temperature reactive dyes, including the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Shorter application cycle Elimination of steaming process, resulting in energy savings Elimination of the caustic/hydrosulfite reduction clearing bath loaded after disperse dyeing New types of sulfur dyes which have been introduced recently feature lower sulfide content, which lowers sulfide discharges to mill effluent, and reduces hydrogen sulfide odors in the mill and in the waste treatment system.
Glucose or even sugars from corn can also be substituted for sulfidecontaining reducing agents.
In one case, using alternative reducing agents significantly lowered the sulfide concentration in the effluent.
Sandoz Chemicals Corporation has developed the Sandozol RDT line of sulfur dyes, which offers benefits similar to those of its traditional line, while adding environmental advantages, such as reduced odor, sulfide reduction, lower water requirements, and easier cleanup.
Sandozol RDT dyes are manufactured with a minimum of sulfide reducer and require no additional sulfide in processing; they rely instead, on a proprietary reducing agent that was developed especially for Sandozol Reducer RDT, a new colorant line,.
New auxiliary agents, such as Sandoz Chemicals Corporation's Sandpure RSK, increase wash efficiency, thereby decreasing water consumption and improving the fastness of the reactive dyes.
Sandpure RSK is especially effective with difficult blue and green shades, and is innocuous to the environment.
BASF is developing a new and improved leveling agent formulation, which is coded NBSE and consists of a combination of selected surfactants.
The main attribute is rapid efficient biodegradability.
Acetic acid is used in a variety of textile processes.
Substituting formic acid for acetic acid can significantly reduce the waste load of the mill.
Acetic acid has a BOD equivalent of 0.64 pound/pound, whereas the BOD equivalent of formic acid is only 0.12 pound/pound.
Eighty-five percent of the BOD load of a dyeing procedure using acetic acid can come from the acid.
Substituting formic acid for acetic acid can also reduce costs because of the lower weight equivalent and higher purity of formic acid.
Organic acids, such as acetic acid, can also be substituted for by ammonium sulphate, ammonium chloride, or mineral acids (0 percent BOD) for pH adjustment in disperse dyeing and pigment printing.
Although the salt concentration of the effluent would increase in this substitution, ammonium would serve as a nutrient in the biological treatment process.
Another substitute for acetic acid is sodium bicarbonate, in conjunction with peroxide or perborate, for the oxidation of vat dyestuffs.
Other chemical substitution strategies in dyeing include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ For dyeing blended varieties in pale shades, use single-class dyestuffs, such as Indigisol and pigments, rather than two-stage dyeing, which uses two different classes of dyes (such as polyester using disperse dyes, cellulosics using vats, and reactives).
Use all-aqueous phthalogen blue dyeing rather than solvent-based phthalogen blue dyeing, which requires specialty auxiliary products.
For dyeing Dacron, use monochlorobenzene rather than other carriers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ PROCESS MODIFICATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES Ultra-Low-Liquor-Ratio Dyeing In dyebaths, chemicals that act on the bath--salt, pH control, acid/alkali, lubricants, and dispersing agents--are normally measured by bath volume, and chemicals that act on the fabric--dyes and softeners--are measured by the weight of goods (fabric).
There is now a trend toward reduced bath ratio dyeing, in which energy and chemical use in dyeing is generally a function of the bath volume, not the amount of fabric, thereby saving energy and dyebath chemicals (see Case Studies No. 4 and No. 10).
Ultra-low-liquor-ratio (ULLR) dyeing, which is a form of reduced bath ratio dyeing, has the following advantages: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Decreased water consumption and associated cost savings Decreased consumption of bath chemicals Improved dye fixation Reduced cycle times because of quicker machine drains and more rapid heating and cooling Ã¯Â¿Â½ Decreased energy requirements for heating the dyebath, which results in reduced steam usage, less boiler usage, reduced fuel consumption, and fewer emission losses from combustion In some fabric dyeing machines, ULLR techniques have lowered bath ratios from 30:1 to 5:1; below the ratio of 5:1, insufficient water is present to keep the pumps "wet."
Package dyeing and jet dyeing are commonly used for low-ratio dyeing (Figure III-9).
In package dyeing, the yarn remains stationary while the dyebath is being pumped through the machine cylinder.
In jet dyeing, a jet of dye solution, foam, or air is pumped through a venturi to transport fabric through a closed tubular system.
Generally, ULLR concepts cannot be retrofitted onto existing dyeing machines, because lower water levels may cause pump cavitation or poor fabric movement through the dye chamber.
Companies must purchase specially designed ULLR jet or package machines that feature (1) a kier having a different configuration, size, and shape from that found on a normal jet, and (2) low-volume pumps and piping.
The installed cost of a typical ULLR jet with a 30000-pound-per-week capacity is about $1 million (high capital cost).
BASF's Multiplus NB-100 is an acrylate polymer that is designed to increase liquor pick-up in difficult textile systems, such as low-liquor-ratio coloration of cellulosics, acid dyeing of nylon carpet, and acrylic coloration.
The product is stable to acids, alkalis, and electrolytes, and offers increased wet pick-up, better use of dye, increased equipment flexibility, and greater process uniformity.
NB100 also provides excellent lubricity to the dyeing system, which allows ease of loading in jet machines without surfactants, thereby eliminating the need for silicone-based defoamers.
Running marks, such as crack marks and crows' feet, are eliminated via added lubricity.
Pad-Batch Dyeing
In pad-batch dyeing, the prepared, dyed fabric--mainly 100 percent cotton and polyester/cotton blends--is impregnated with a cold solution of reactive dye and alkali.
The excess liquor is squeezed from the fabric as it leaves through the padding trough.
The wet fabric is stored on rolls at ambient temperatures for fixations during a period of 2 to 48 hours.
W hile in batching, the dyestuff reacts with, and penetrates, the fabric, which results in a very even and consistent color.
Rolls are covered with a polyethylene film to prevent evaporation of the dye solution.
Pad-batch dyeing offers several significant advantages, mainly in waste reduction, simplicity, and speed.
The quality of pad-batch dyeing is equal to or better than that of other dyeing systems.
Benefits include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Minimize (eliminated in some cases) use of salt or specialty chemicals, resulting in reduced effluent waste loads and increased savings in chemical and wastewater treatment costs More efficient use of dyes, resulting in reduced water and energy consumption More consistent dye quality High production speed High color yields Excellent penetration and leveling characteristics Rapid fixation, resulting in shade reliability and reproducibility Can be used on wovens or knits in many constructions Can retrofit available equipment, such as becks, beams, and continuous washing equipment Requires a low capital outlay Substantial overall cost savings, in dyes, chemicals, labor, and water
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Production case histories have shown that pad-batch dyeing of cotton, rayon, and blends conserves energy, water, dyes, chemicals, labor, and floor space.
W ater consumption for pad-batch dyeing with beam wash-off is typically under 2 gallons per pound of dyed fabric, compared to typically 20 gallons or more on atmospheric becks for the same fiber-reactive dyed shades.
Energy consumption is similarly reduced from about 9,000 British thermal units (Btu) per pound of dyed fabric for becks to under 2,000 Btus per pound for pad batch with beam washing.
Use of chemicals--including alkali and specialty chemicals--can be reduced by up to 80 percent from use of chemicals associated with atmospheric becks.
Fixation ratios for pad-batch dyeing have been reported from 92 to 97 percent, compared with 42 to 80 percent for reactive dyes at a 10:1 exhaust dyeing bath ratio.
In terms of reduced labor costs, two workers per shift can dye 200,000 pounds of fabric per 5-day week.
Uniform preparation of the fabric is required to obtain good quality dyeing in cold pad dyeing.
The fabric should not contain any traces of natural oils, waxes, or sizing chemicals, because they interfere with dyeing.
Pad batch dyeing requires highly reactive "cold dyeing" fiber-reactive dyes.
Examples include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Atlantic's Altafix CX Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ciba-Geigy's Cibacron F Sandoz Chemicals Corporation's Drimarine K C 
Operating costs (excluding dyes) are about 20 percent less, and pad-batch dye chemical costs are about 40 percent less.
Foam Processing Technology There are several common commercial applications of foam processing, including carpet dyeing, coating operations, foam dyeing, and foam finishing.
Textile dyes can be applied through foam media by replacing water with air.
The foam process is applicable only to continuous dyeing.
Unlike continuous dyeing-- in which fabric is immersed in a liquid, and excess dye liquor is squeezed out before fixation and/or drying--the precise amount of foamed dye composition is applied to the fabric.
Because absolute uniformity of application is required in continuous dyeing of solid shade, foam application systems are used in the U.S. mainly to apply finishes rather than apply colorants.
Dye penetration and uniformity are problems to be solved.
Foam dyeing has been used in limited commercial practices with some textiles, such as nylon carpet, polyester and acrylic nonwovens, and polyester/cotton narrow-width industrial toweling.
Flocked and velour-type plush fabrics have been successfully foam-dyed in limited production trials; however, this technology has recently yielded to spray and liquid slot dyeing techniques in carpet production.
Advantages of foam processing are as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Reduced water and energy consumption Reduced chemical waste Less time required for drying (less water to evaporate) Automated Chemical and Dye Dosing Systems Automated dosing systems can be optimized to deliver the correct amount of a specific chemical at precisely the desired time.
This improves the efficiency and reliability of chemical reactions in the dyebath, ensuring results that are more consistent and reproducible.
Also, these systems avoid the tendency to overuse environmentally harmful chemicals that may pass through treatment systems unreacted or react to produce undesirable by-products.
Dosing systems reduce handling losses and equipment cleanup.
Automated dosing systems are commercially available and are being adopted throughout the textile industry (see Case Study No. 1).
Some systems that are now being developed can sense dye exhaustion as it occurs and adjust the dosing profile of salt and alkali accordingly.
Fast and accurate dry dispensing systems for powder dyes are available.
The systems feature storage compartments, valves, weighing devices, and mechanical parts that are extremely resistant to corrosion and easy to clean.
Precision of 0.01 gram on a 10-kilogram delivery is available, and the accuracy is within 1 percent.
Hard automated container transport to and from the dispensing area is also included in the system.
The automated color kitchen conducts automatic color mixing and batching, which not only reduces working losses from cleanup and disorderly work practices, but also ensures that the correct amount of mix is prepared every time, thereby reducing discards.
Reducing start-up and stop-off waste also makes shorter runs on continuous equipment economically feasible.
Continuous Dye Ranges Continuous dyeing ranges offer inherent P2 advantages, including the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ No exhausted dyebath to discard High levels of fixation Ability to reuse washwater in countercurrent operation Less use of specialty chemicals Elimination of salt for dyeing cotton Disadvantages include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ High lengthwise tension to which knits would be subjected, thereby preventing normal dyeing of knits in continuous processes Lot size restrictions Discharge of leftover mixes and pad baths at stop-off and color changeovers Higher pollution potential of cleaning agents Several equipment manufacturers have recently introduced features intended to overcome the limitations of continuous dye ranges (Figure III-10), including (1) continuous knit dyeing ranges that feature tensionless knit handling, (2) dye application systems that avoid tubular edge marks, and (3) suitable guidance systems for knits.
The ability to run knits by continuous dyeing methods opens up many possibilities, including the use of vat dyes for green shades, thereby eliminating metalcontaining reactive dyes, eliminating salt from effluents, and generally increasing flexibility for dye class selection.
Mercerizing to Improve Dye Fixation Improvements in dye fixation and lower chemical requirements overall can be attained by mercerizing cotton yarn or fabric during the preparation process, thereby decreasing dye uptake and reducing the need for chemical accelerants.
Therefore, mercerizing can reduce the amount of dye needed to achieve a specific shade and decrease the amount of color in the wastewater.
The tradeoff is that mercerization uses highly concentrated sodium hydroxide (22 percent), which is a pollution concern.
Improved Efficiency in Washing Technology W ashing operations consume a high percentage of the water used in wet textile processing.
Continuous dyeing machines can be made more water-efficient through the use of flow restrictors, which control water volume.
In addition, countercurrent washing and recycling of clean water are important features of continuous dyeing and printing operations (see Case Study No. 6).
Supercritical Fluid Dyeing
Supercritical fluid (SCF) dyeing is an emerging P2 technology that uses carbon dioxide as the fluid medium for disperse dyeing on synthetics.
No water or pollution is associated with the SCF process, and the carbon dioxide evaporates without any applied heat, thereby conserving energy.
Ciba Geigy Limited has teamed with the German Center for Textile Research Northwest e.V. (Krefeld, Germany) and equipment manufacturer Joseph Jaspers GmbH 
(Velen, Germany) to develop a range of disperse dyes that can be carried in supercritical carbon dioxide instead of water; this technology promises dye uptake of 100 percent with no wastewater.
Pilot plant operations went online in the summer of 1992.
Although it is currently limited to polyester, the process appears to be promising for other hard-to-dye fibers, such as aramids and polypropylene.
Vacuum Impregnation and Extraction In vacuum impregnation, the fabric contacts a perforated cylinder, and air is extracted by the vacuum.
Dye solution contacts the fabric before the fabric is returned to atmospheric pressure, thereby promoting penetration of dye into the fabric.
This technique is particularly useful for dyeing heavy fabrics, which are difficult to dye uniformly by conventional means.
Vacuum impregnation can also be applied to various finishing processes (see Final Finishing subsection), such as durable-press and flame retardant finishing.
Vacuum extraction systems have been applied successfully in pigment dyeing and continuous dyeing with solid shades.
Vacuum extraction by slots or porous rollers will reduce the water content more effectively than conventional methods, thereby reducing the amount of energy required for drying.
The key is to economically separate (via a cyclone separator) air and water, and recycle the dye solution.
Indigo Dye Recovery through Ultrafiltration (UF) Indigo dyes pose a major waste problem for textile manufacturers.
Using UF to recover indigo dye can prevent pollution and save a valuable resource--indigo dye has a significant value at $9 per pound.
The UF process centers on a pressure membrane that separates the effluent stream into two components (Figure III-11).
The isolated component, or concentrate, contains the reusable indigo dye.
The second component, or permeate, is nearly pure water with a fraction of solid materials.
The UF system uses a cross-flow technique that circulates the effluent across, or parallel to, the membrane surface, thereby creating a self-cleaning action that minimizes accumulation of materials that can reduce filtration efficiency.
More than 98 percent of the indigo in wash water can be separated by the filtration process.
Figure III-12 shows the processing savings and costs associated with UF of indigo dyes.
Gaston County Dyeing Machine Company manufactures an UF system which uses a porous carbon tube with an inert zirconium membrane.
The membrane is usable for the full pH range of 1 to 14 and to temperatures approaching 100oC, and can be designed for either batch or continuous systems.
Since 1981, a Liberty, South Carolina, textile plant has been recovering indigo with minimal problems, and paid for the recovery system in less than 2 years of operation.
UF is accomplished by using a vinyl-sulfone membrane system.
The Liberty plant modified the dyeing process to prevent contamination of the indigo waste stream, as follows: when sulfur dyes are used, they are applied after the indigo dye has been applied.
The multistage recovery system uses a single-feed pump and a bleed valve to automatically establish progressively higher steady state concentrations of dye at each stage, with the final stage achieving the maximum concentration of indigo for reuse.
The indigo waste stream should be produced from countercurrent flow wash boxes having an adjusted flow of about 25 gallons per minute; this minimizes the cost of the membrane system.
The system is preceded by a vibrating screen that is used to remove lint.
After the indigo has been concentrated, it is filtered through a basket strainer and stored in a holding tank.
Cone Mills (Greensboro, North Carolina) and the Dan River Textile Company (Greenville, South Carolina) are two satisfied customers that installed indigo recovery systems.
Installation of an indigo recovery system requires redesign of the rinse boxes to a countercurrent rinse system.
The redesign reduces the amount of water required in rinsing by 80 percent and results in an adequately concentrated feed for the UF unit.
Improved Operating Practices Because of the difficulties and expense involved in treating color, the best approach to minimizing color discharges is through P2.
Three important areas for preventing and minimizing color discharges are as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maximizing exhaustion from dyebaths Maximizing fixation and minimizing wash off Optimizing dye handling to eliminate spillage, machine and implement cleanup, and discards In cellulosic batch dyeing processes, the most important factors are as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Good cloth preparation Low bath ratio High-affinity dyes Optimization of pH and salt Proper time-temperature profile relationships Avoidance of auxiliaries that retard or reduce exhaustion Minimized use of auxiliaries and surfactants Avoidance of adding chemicals to offset undesired side effects (nonchemical alternatives--such as procedural or mechanical remedies, changing dye selection, or changing product--should be used) In fiber-reactive batch dyeings, the most important factors are as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use of two-step dyeings, not all-in-one Use of fixatives Ensuring maximum fixation by proper sequencing of events In continuous dyeing, the most important factors are as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Proper dwell time and temperature in the steamer/thermofixation oven Not introducing oxygen in steamers, which can oxidize vat dyes prematurely and lead to excessive washoff Preparation of precise amounts of dye solution, because extra amounts will be discarded Dyebath ratios can sometimes be reduced by using volume displacers that result in lower chemical and water use requirements (Figure III-13).
Many textile chemical suppliers have already implemented container return programs that facilitate return and recycling of many metal, plastic, and cardboard containers from the manufacturing sites to the generating facility.
In the long term, an increased reliance on tank car deliveries, facilitated by improved and controlled automatic delivery systems, will minimize the need for small and prolific containers.
Right-First-Time Dyeing "Right-first-time" dyeing is an effective P2 practice that eliminates (1) reworks, (2) redyes, (3) shade adjustments, (4) top-ups, or (5) adds.
These corrective measures (1) can be very chemicallyintensive, (2) have less chance of achieving the desired quality, and (3) represent high reprocessing costs, in terms of additional dyes and chemicals.
Studies have shown that the cost of dyeing can increase by as much as 30 percent when dye additions are required.
Right-first-time dyeing leads to increased productivity and more efficient use of fixed capital and labor.
Improved dyeing machines have features that facilitate right-first-time dyeings, such as accurate process conditions (pressure sensors and chemical feeds).
In one case, a 10 percent improvement in right-first-time production generated a 1.7 percent decrease in product waste and a $2 cost reduction per 100 kilograms of fabric dyed.
Recycling and Reuse Dyebath Reuse Dyebath reuse is the process by which exhausted hot dyebaths are analyzed for residual colorant concentrations, replenished, and reused to dye additional batches of material.
Dyebath reuse provides an alternative that is less than constructing a pretreatment system; also, it reduces effluent volume and pollutant concentrations in the effluent.
Dyebath reuse requires a smaller capital outlay than pretreatment systems and offers a return on the investment in the form of dye, chemical, and energy savings.
Dyebath reuse principles can also be applied to bleach baths.
Dyebath reuse carries the higher risk of shade variation, because impurities can build up in the dyebath and decrease the reliability of the process.
Dyebath reuse can be used reliably on dyes that exhaust quantitatively, such as acid dyes on nylon or basic dyes on acrylic.
Figure III-14 illustrates a typical dyebath reconstitution process.
If properly controlled, dyebaths can be reused for 15 or more cycles (ranging from five to 25).
For maximum dyebath reuse benefits, use dye classes that undergo minimal changes during the dyeing process, such as (1) acid dyes for nylon and wool, (2) basic dyes for acrylic and some copolymers, (3) direct dyes for cotton, and (4) disperse dyes for synthetic polymers.
Vat, sulfur, and fiberreactive dyes are very difficult to use.
Typical costs for dyebath reuse include capital costs of about $24,000 to $34,000 per dye machine for lab equipment and machine modifications, and annual operating costs of $1,000 to $2,000 per dye machine.
Typical annual savings--in the form of dyes, chemicals, water, sewer, and energy--are about $21,000 per dye machine.
Reconstitution and reuse of dyebaths have also been extended to the dyeing of fabric in jet dyeing machines.
Dyeing of Nomex Type 455 (Aramid, Du Pont) plain weave fabrics was selected, because large quantities of costly auxiliaries are required to dye this material.
A spectrophotometer was used to monitor for proper dye concentrations.
Most auxiliary chemicals used in dyeing are generally nonreactive and are not absorbed by the substrate being dyed.
Because they are not consumed or removed during the dyeing cycle, the principal loss results from the retention of liquor in the fabric that is being dyed.
Dyebaths were used up to 15 times before being discharged.
Color reproducibility, color uniformity, crock fastness, and flammability of samples dyed by the reuse system were comparable to those achieved with conventional dyeing.
Dye, chemical, water, and energy requirements were reduced significantly.
The capital cost of modifying a typical jet-dyeing machine for reuse dyeing and for required analytical instrumentation was $15,000.
Annual savings possible with the reuse system are projected at over $100,000 ($0.25/pound of fabric dyed).
Plant personnel can be easily trained to operate the new system.
Dyebath reuse has also been used with nylon pantyhose that were dyed in rotary drum machines.
The textile plant constantly dyes 30 batches of hosiery in reuse sequences.
Acid dyes and other chemical auxiliaries were used in the dyeing.
The plant's scale of operation was about 612,000 pounds of textile products annually.
Cost savings were estimated at $0.02/pound of product (Tables III-2 and III-3).
To gain the maximum benefit from dyebath reuse, users must consider that the easiest systems to manage for dyebath reuse are dye classes that undergo minimum changes during the dyeing processes, as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Acid dyes for nylon and wool Basic dyes for acrylic and some copolymers Direct dyes for cotton Disperse dyes for synthetic polymers Salt Recycling The upsurge in the use of cotton in textile products has significantly increased the use of direct, vat, sulfur, and, especially, reactive dyes.
These dyeing processes all require large quantities of salt (up to 120 grams per liter) to achieve good exhaustion of the dyebath.
As a result, the content of dissolved salt in textile wastewater is increasing.
Progress has been made in reducing salt requirements for some newer reactive dyes, but salt concentrations are still much too high.
This is a special problem for plants considering some form of land application for textile processing wastewater.
Because of the inactive form of the dye that is present in the bath at the end of the cycle, reactive dyebaths are not amenable to reuse.
Several techniques for removing reactive dyes, and recycling the water and dissolved salt, are being considered.
Ozonation, chlorination, and electrochemical reduction are currently being investigated.
UF may also be promising for removing the dye, and for reusing the water and salt.
In this application, a membrane would be required to pass water and dissolved salt, but retain the larger reactive dye molecules.
Such membranes are expected to be relatively easy to engineer, and a simple system for brine recycling could be designed.
The cost savings derived from recycling the salt would probably provide an economic TABLE III-2 TYPICAL COST AND SAVINGS FOR DYEBATH REUSE Dye Machine Laboratory and support equipment Modifications (tanks, pumps, pipes) Annual operating costs Annual savings, total Dyes and chemicals Water Sewer Energy Cost/Savings per Machine ($) 9,000 15,000 to 25,000 1,000 to 2,000 21,000 15,000 750 750 4,500 TABLE III-3 SYSTEMS FOR DYEBATH REUSE Produce Knit fabric Fiber Ã¯Â¿Â½ Polyester Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cotton Ã¯Â¿Â½ Polyester/cotton Ã¯Â¿Â½ Polyester Ã¯Â¿Â½ Polyester/cotton Ã¯Â¿Â½ Acrylic Ã¯Â¿Â½ Nylon/spandex Ã¯Â¿Â½ Nylon/spandex Ã¯Â¿Â½ Nylon Ã¯Â¿Â½ Polyester Ã¯Â¿Â½ Aramid/nomex Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cotton Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cotton Ã¯Â¿Â½ Acrylic Dye Class Ã¯Â¿Â½ Disperse Ã¯Â¿Â½ Reactive or direct Ã¯Â¿Â½ Disperse/reactive or direct Ã¯Â¿Â½ Disperse Ã¯Â¿Â½ Disperse/reactive or direct Ã¯Â¿Â½ Basic Ã¯Â¿Â½ Acid Ã¯Â¿Â½ Disperse/acid Ã¯Â¿Â½ Disperse Ã¯Â¿Â½ Disperse/acid Ã¯Â¿Â½ Disperse Ã¯Â¿Â½ Basic Ã¯Â¿Â½ Direct Ã¯Â¿Â½ Vat/Sulfur Ã¯Â¿Â½ Basic Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jet Ã¯Â¿Â½ Beck Ã¯Â¿Â½ Beck Ã¯Â¿Â½ Package Ã¯Â¿Â½ Package Ã¯Â¿Â½ Package Ã¯Â¿Â½ Paddle Ã¯Â¿Â½ Beck Ã¯Â¿Â½ Paddle/drum Ã¯Â¿Â½ Beck Ã¯Â¿Â½ Beck Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jet Ã¯Â¿Â½ Reel Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jig Ã¯Â¿Â½ Skein Machine Yarn package Socks Pantyhose Carpet W oven fabric Skein incentive for installation of a source reduction technology in reactive dyeing.
Membrane Filtration and Water Reuse W astewater discharged from the reactive dyeing of cotton and cotton blend fabrics is characterized by high concentrations of potentially toxic nonbiodegradable salts and unacceptable color levels.
Studies have demonstrated that economic payback could be achieved by selectively treating the waters with the heaviest concentration of pollutants and using this permeate as process water in subsequent dyeings.
One pilot study at the Sara Lee Knit Products Development Laboratory in W inston-Salem, North Carolina, conducted with dye jet wastewater, demonstrated the viability of a system of UF followed by nanofiltration (UF/NF).
The ability to reuse the water and salt permeate offers a cost savings in terms of raw material and disposal costs, with minor changes to established dyeing procedures.
For a representative dyehouse, the addition of a 12000-gallon-per-minute UF/NF treatment system would offer a cost return of about 1-Ã¯Â¿Â½ years, based on capital costs of $850,000 and operating costs of $180,000 per year; operating savings would be about $900,000 per year.
Wastew ater Reuse The colored wastewater from the soaping operation can be reused at the backgrey washer, which does not require water of very high quality.
Alternatively, it can be used for cleaning floors and equipment in the print and color shop.
The rinse water from the final rinse in a batch dyeing operation is relatively clean and can be used directly for further makeup of subsequent dyebaths.
Several woven fabric and carpet mills use rinse water or non-contact cooling water for dyebath makeup (see Case Study No. 6).
Textile Mill Waste Treatment Plant Sludge W aste treatment plant sludges, or "biosolids," from textile mills are now being used to add nitrogen and soil conditioner to the clay soils of cotton farming operations.
Burlington Industries donates nitrogen-rich textile waste sludge from its Knit Fabrics Division finishing plant in Raleigh, North Carolina, to area farmers, thereby avoiding landfilling fees.
PROCESS 5--PRINTING In printing, color is deposited on the fabric and fixed by using steam, heat, or chemical treatment.
Print pastes are formulated to (1) ensure proper flow properties during application (thixography), and (2) adhere to the fabric until they are dried.
Commercial printing methods include (1) pigment printing, which comprises about 75 to 85 percent of all printing operations, (2) wet printing, (3) discharge printing, and (4) carpet printing.
Print application consumes less water and produces less BOD than the preparation operations-- such as desizing, scouring, and bleaching--that precede it.
In pigment printing, the main source of waste is from the cleanup, during which unused printing paste is removed from the screen.
Typical wastes generated during various printing techniques include color residues, AP-based surfactants, solvents, urea, and metals.
Source Reduction INPUT MATERIAL CHANGES Oil/Water Emulsions Oil/water emulsions, which form the basis of printing paste, contribute substantial amounts of fats, oil, and grease to the wastewater stream, and release hydrocarbons to the air during drying and curing.
Synthetic polymers are a good alternative to traditional emulsions.
Also, an extremely small amount (compared to deodorized kerosene) of synthetic polymer is needed to thicken pastes for printing.
Biodegradable vegetable oils can also be used as an alternative to mineral oils which are difficult to treat.
Reducing (Discharging) Agents During afterwashing of the printed fabric, metals are released to wastewater as a result of using metal-based reducing agents in discharge printing processes for polyester fabric.
Commercially available sodium hydrosulfite and other nonmetallic agents provide good alternatives.
In addition, the use of ester-based dyes, rather than azo dyes, for overpadding allows for discharging with alkalibased discharge agents, thereby reducing the need for reductive discharge agents.
Surfactants Surfactants are commonly used in printing processes (1) to adjust the rheology of the paste, (2) to obtain correct print paste penetration properties, (3) as a component of conventional and foam type print pastes, and (4) for afterwashing of printed fabrics.
W henever possible, nonionic surfactants should be selected, because they have low aquatic toxicity and BOD, yet maintain excellent wetting properties.
Nonionic surfactants are also biodegradable and reasonable in cost.
Urea Replacement Chemical substitution with nonnitrogen chemicals has been unsuccessful to date.
One possible substitute for urea is dicyanamide, which contains nitrogen but is less polluting than urea.
Combining urea with a proprietary printing assistant can reduce urea usage by up to 80 percent.
PROCESS MODIFICATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES Transfer Printing Transfer printing (sublistatic transfer printing) involves placing synthetic fabric (normally polyester) in direct contact with paper that contains disperse dyes (Figure III-15).
Under high pressure and heat, the solid dyes vaporize and deposit themselves onto the cloth, replicating the exact pattern on the paper.
Transfer printing shifts the burden of P2 and waste handling from the textile printer to the manufacturer of the transfer paper.
This method of printing deposits only the dye on the fabric without requiring the use of additional chemicals.
Therefore, no afterwashing is required, and no effluent is generated during the printing process.
Other advantages include the ability to perform QC on paper before printing on fabric occurs, and this method is economical for short runs, and frequent color or pattern changes.
Limitations of transfer printing include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Limited to volatile dyes Most appropriate for synthetic fibers; does not work well with natural fibers Limited dye penetration Ink-Jet Printing Ink-jet printing is a noncontact process in which drops of color solution are propelled toward a substrate and directed to a desired spot.
Ink-jet printing is a new technology that is not yet used extensively in the textile industry.
However, it offers numerous P2 benefits, including the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Does not require the use of solvents for thickeners and clears, or for machine cleaning Allows for instantaneous pattern and color change while reducing wastes associated with cleanup Eliminates photographic screen making, which reduces silver input into wastewater effluent Provides direct QC through computer-controlled printing Flash Aging Flash aging, or two-stage printing, is a multistep process that involves printing with highly reactive dyes, drying, overpadding with alkali/salt bath, and high-temperature steaming.
This method does not use urea, but it uses more alkali.
Urea is generally considered more of a problem than alkali.
Prewetting Prewetting involves using moisture systems to prewet fabric, immediately prior to steaming, to a wet add-on of 30 percent.
Prewetting attracts moisture to the fabric during steaming, which is one of the main functions that urea performs.
However, these methods are not as effective on rayon as they are on cotton.
W ith proper attention, use of urea can be reduced in rayon printing.
Foam Technology In foam printing, the rheology of the print paste is controlled by (1) the volume of air that is whipped into the print formulation, and (2) the size of the air bubbles.
This virtually eliminates the need for thickeners.
Also, commercial trials of foam printing have demonstrated (1) energy savings of 35 percent, and (2) line speed increases of 30 to 35 percent.
Currently, the major limitation in foam printing is the short useful life of the print foam.
However, foam printing technology is progressing rapidly.
Xerographic Printing Xerographic printing of fabrics is an emerging technology that uses modified paper xerography techniques, and promises numerous P2 advantages.
The process is based on the electrostatic attraction between charged plates and toner powder.
The image is transferred only onto the charged areas, creating a positive image.
The print is then fixed by thermally melting the toner.
A significant advantage of xerography printing is that the print information can be stored optically by computer rather than in rotary screens.
Specific steps in xerographic printing technology include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Form a negative image on a light-sensitive, photo-conductive surface via light reflection off a printed master sheet.
(This process is often accomplished by a computer-aided design that can be digitally scanned or downloaded.)
Develop the negative image into a positive image by contact with a powder developer system, transferring toner to the still-charged design areas of the drum.
Melt the toner by contact with a heated roll, and air cool to fix the print.
Clean the drum, and recycle any untransferred toner to begin a repeat of the print cycle.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Current barriers that researchers face in adapting xerography printing techniques for use in the textile industry center mainly on developing the proper toners to meet textile requirements, such as fastness and aesthetic properties.
P2 advantages include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Elimination of water in the printing process Significant energy reduction No effluent QC through computer-aided design Ã¯Â¿Â½ JIT production for consumers, reducing unwanted goods Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Printing The concepts of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engraving (CAE), and computeraided coloring (CAC) are improving the way in which designs are conceived, developed, and transferred into rotary screens for textile printing.
The design is created directly on a computer display through CAD, and CAE techniques enable the designer to manipulate geometrical forms and make changes within a few minutes.
Colors are manipulated through CAC, working with the plant's shade library and dyestuffs, the latter via a computerized color kitchen operation.
Ink-jet printers are used to translate the initial display design into a hard copy for customer approval, usually on paper but increasingly on fabric.
Computer-driven laser engraving is used to convert the final design into a working rotary screen.
Although the design information is stored on disks, rotary screens must still be made, stored, maintained, and replaced.
Direct imaging techniques on fabrics, with complete digital storage and translation of information, will eventually replace computer-aided rotary screen printing.
IMPROVED OPERATING PRACTICES As in dyeing, the key to minimizing color discharges in printing operations is to maximize fixation.
Discards and pad dumps from printing operations comprise the main source of color in wastewater.
Printing is an inherently messy operation, and housekeeping can play an important role in minimizing color discharges.
Handling of paste and cleaning of mixers, homogenizers, screens, and squeegees should be closely controlled.
Drums of print paste or empty drums of chemicals should not be washed out into the drain.
Residues should be drained into the next drum to be opened.
If excess paste remains, it should be reused or added to in making up a future color recipe.
Minimize implement cleanup by using "dedicated" dippers for each chemical or installing an automatic chemical dispensing system.
Washing Practices During afterwashing of prints, water can be conserved by implementing high-extraction separations between print washes.
This provides a more efficient washing by increasing the removal of unfixed dye, print paste, and other residual components.
Carryover water can also be reduced with highextraction pad rolls or vacuum extractors for continuous print washers.
Countercurrent washing is a method that uses water efficiently if it is properly implemented.
Print Paste Handling Color kitchens typically generate significant quantities of solid and liquid wastes during mixing, dispensing, and cleaning.
These wastes can be eliminated or reduced by adopting operating practices that focus on preventing pollution.
Examples include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Shorten piping lengths that carry print paste.
This reduces residual paste volumes and cleanup.
Install automated print paste make-up equipment to eliminate spills and reduce the amount of paste that remains after a run.
Automated make-up equipment allows quick, efficient, and accurate recipes; this reduces the need for mixing and storing large batches of paste that may expire or become unusable.
Recycling And Reuse Silver The use of silver is eliminated by the development of emerging printing technologies, such as ink-jet printing and computer-aided screening, that directly digitize patterns, because photographic processes are not required.
However, photographic techniques that do generate silver-containing effluent are still common in the textile industry.
Precious metals recovery firms can successfully recover silver from fixer and developer solutions, which results in effluent that is less toxic and a recovered solution that is potentially of substantial value (see Case Study No. 3).
Inventory of Print Paste If properly inventoried and managed, excess print paste maintained in storage can be reused when a suitable use is identified.
Good inventory tracking allows (1) all new orders for paste to be reviewed against available colors in storage, and (2) compatible orders to be identified.
Maximizing the reuse of pastes can significantly reduce the volume of paste discarded as waste.
PROCESS 6--FINAL FINISHING Most fabrics undergo one or more final finishing processes (involving both chemical and physical processes) to enhance properties such as durability, appearance, or safeness.
Finishing processes can generate (1) solid wastes (scrap fabric, fiber dust, paper tubes, and empty chemical drums), (2) liquid wastes (discarded finishing compounds, rinse waters, and wash water from general cleaning), and (3) air pollutants (VOCs from drying and curing).
This section discusses reducing or eliminating these pollutants during finishing operations through source reduction or recycling/reuse.
Fabric coating operations based on latex materials and solvents--such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, toluene, and xylene--produce (1) various waterproof products, (2) offset printing blankets, (3) landfill liners, and (4) other engineered textile products.
In many cases, they are produced by swelling or dissolving natural or synthetic rubber or latex materials in a mixture of solvents, then spreading or spraying the plasticized material onto fabrics, followed by drying or curing.
Source Reduction INPUT MATERIAL CHANGES Cross Linkers Cotton and cotton blend fabrics often require a finishing step with a reactive cellulose cross linker to reduce fabric shrinking and wrinkling.
The use of reactive N-methylol cross linkers in the permanent press finishing step often results in formaldehyde being released.
Currently, the most commonly used cross linking compound used in the textile industry is dimethylol dihydroxy ethylene urea (DMDHEU).
Releases of formaldehyde resulting from the proper use of DMDHEU are minimal, but they still occur.
Commercially available cross linkers that do not contain formaldehyde include butane tetra carboxylic acid and dimethyl dihydroxy ethylene urea.
Neither of these agents contains formaldehyde; however, they are considerably more expensive than DMDHEU and are inferior in performance to DMDHEU.
In the absence of cost-effective substitutes for cross linkers containing formaldehyde, DMDHEU products containing the lowest formaldehyde content should be selected for use whenever possible.
Also, the cross linking agent should be properly applied under optimum conditions to reduce the potential for release of formaldehyde.
Builders or Handbuilders Film-forming agents or builders are often applied during the finishing process to increase the body or stiffness of some lightweight fabrics.
Reactive formaldehyde-based N-methylol builders can effectively be replaced by nonreactive agents, such as natural and synthetic polymers, that are less harmful to the environment.
Natural polymers include starches, modified starches, alginates, and gums.
The use of these polymers can be relatively environmentally safe; however, they have a high BOD.
Synthetic polymers, which include PVA and polyacrylates (acrylic and vinyl), are normally good substitutes for the formaldehyde-based agents.
Polymeric-based (nonformaldehyde) fixatives are effective on packages and piece goods, and are competitively priced.
However, the manufacture of some of the synthetic polymers has been linked to pollutants being generated.
Softeners Various natural and synthetic softener compounds are commonly used in the finishing process without regard for environmental considerations.
Designed application, performance, and environmental impact of softening agents can vary widely between softener types.
Nonsmoking alternatives to mineral oil and paraffin wax softeners include polyethylene glycol and polyethylene oxide.
Triglycerides and oligomeric esters are also being developed as nonsmoking alternatives to fiber finishers and yarn lubricants that allow increased production speeds with low friction while withstanding high temperatures.
Reactive silicone-based softeners can provide enhanced long-term performance, because they do not readily wash off fabrics during home laundering.
Silicone-enhanced cationic blend formulations, which are available commercially, are less costly than all-silicone softeners and expand finished design properties, such as increased whiteness.
In the finish process for some textile products, the use of chemical additives as softeners can be eliminated by using cellulose enzymes (liquid acid stable cellulase enzyme) to remove surface roughness.
Some types of ring spun yarn that are inherently softer can also be substituted to reduce chemical additives.
Mothproofers The use of chemicals for mothproofing of wool fabric is often an important finishing procedure, especially in the carpet industry.
Traditional mothproofing involved the use of permethrin, which is now under strict regulatory control internationally because of its high aquatic toxicity.
Although numerous chemical alternatives to permethrin have been developed, few demonstrate equivalent performance while still being environmentally safe.
Chemical mothproofing alternatives that are currently being used with some success include (1) cycloprothrin (good performance with low aquatic toxicity), (2) diphenylurea (low aquatic toxicity, but not as biodegradable), and (3) sulcofuron (poor affinity when used in certain application methods).
Alternatives currently under investigation include nitromethylene and permethrin, and pythroid-based insecticides.
PROCESS MODIFICATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES Mechanical Finishing Chemical usage can often be reduced or eliminated by using properly designed mechanical finishing methods to attain the desired end-use properties of the fabric.
Although existing mechanical finishing processes are too numerous to discuss completely, two examples include (1) stabilization of cotton and cotton blend fabrics, and (2) CAD applications.
Cotton and cotton blend fabrics can be stabilized for shrinkage control and sewability without using chemical additives.
Important elements include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Design the process to allow for complete relaxation of the fabric.
Ensure that this complete relaxation of the fabric meets end-use specifications for the consumer product.
Application of CAD programs (available commercially) in designing the finish process can provide for timely and cost-effective selection of the factors (stitch length, machine cut, and yarn specifications) required for producing knit fabric width and yield that are compatible with the relax dimensions of the greige good.
Use of CAD programs should focus on keeping the processing step as tensionless and consistent as possible.
In designing the finish process, always consider using commercially available knit finishing equipment that is capable of controlling the fabric width and length dimensions.
Finishing knits mechanically at natural width and yield prevents the need for resins that contain formaldehyde, which inhibits waste system operations.
Mechanical shrinking of fabric by using the rubber-belt method is an example of mechanical finishing in place of chemical finishing (Figure III-16).
Low Add-On Finishing Several types of low add-on finishing machines are commercially available, all of which apply a very low amount of finish solution to the fabric.
Examples of commercial low add-on finishing techniques (segregated by application) include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Saturation/expression application Ã¯Â¿Â½ High extraction pad Vacuum systems Air jet pad Controlled application Curved blade applicator W icking systems Unstable foam Stable foam Gas phase Printing Spray Low add-on finishing conserves energy, reduces chemical usage rates, prevents chemical leaching or transport, and speeds up production.
The most effective or optimum finish distribution with the greatest reduction in chemical add-on is obtained by (1) lowering the wet pick-up level to a minimum level that will still provide a completely wet fabric, and (2) maintaining the minimum temperature in the dryer.
Gaston County Dyeing Machine Company has developed the Chemical Foam SystemÃ¯Â¿Â½ (CFS), which uses a parabolic applicator system to provide more consistent dwell times for foam in the applicator and a more uniform distribution through the delivery slot across the width of the substrate (Figure III-17).
This results in improved end-to-end liquor and chemical uniformity.
These foam application units can apply a wide variety of chemicals, binders, dyes, and finishes.
Because absolute uniformity of application is required in continuous dyeing of solid shade, foam systems are used in the U.S. mainly to apply finishes rather than colorants.
From an environmental viewpoint, CFS offers two possible approaches to eliminating effluent from the chemical application process.
One is to take the proper strength of generated foam, when in stand-by or at initial start-up, to pass it through a foam separator unit.
The unit removes air from the foam and returns the chemical concentrate for regeneration.
The second means of accomplishing zero discharge is to capture all flush water from the units and collect it in a remote tank, which can be reused pending evaluation.
Advantages are as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ High chemical concentrations in the liquor Minimum thickener needs Fast rates of wetting and penetration into substrate System speeds of 30 to 300 meters per minute Reduced consumption of water and energy Reduced chemical waste Less time required for drying (less water to evaporate) CFS is ideal for uniformly applying low add-on, expensive chemical finishes to lightweight nonwoven fabrics, such as fluoropolymers, silicones, and wetting agents.
W est Point Foundry and Machinery Company developed the Curved Blade ApplicatorÃ¯Â¿Â½(CBA) system, which uses a unique film transfer system instead of the foam collapse route.
A roller is contacted with a trough of liquor containing the desired application chemicals and selected surfactants that will yield the desired film properties on the roller and on subsequent contact with the fabric.
A thin film of liquor is applied to the roll as it contacts the liquid surface.
The roll then rotates to a point at which it contacts the moving fabric under fixed pressure.
Acting as a curved blade, it brings the film to the interface.
Upon contact with the fabric, the film immediately collapses, and the fluid penetrates into the substrate.
Two-sided application of finishes--water repellent on one side and softener on the other--is made possible by the unit's low wet pick-up, which uses a doubleblade modification of the CBA system.
The main concern is generating and maintaining the desired viscosity range for various finish formulations.
The low wet pick-up system that has gained wide acceptance in the large-volume, commodity textile markets is the vacuum extraction and concentrate reisolation system from EVAC Corporation (U.S. representative: Zima Corporation).
EVAC systems allow the manufacturer to fully impregnate the textile with liquor, while providing the mechanism to capture and reuse liquor extracted from the system.
Full impregnation avoids problems with applicator systems, such as foam- or film-based units, by supplying enough liquor to the substrate to achieve uniform through-structure penetration.
The EVAC vacuum system removes the bulk of the entrained liquor, and a unique centrifugal forcebased separation unit isolates fine microdroplets of liquor from the air stream; most of the recovered liquor is reused.
The only effluent from the system is the chemically-bound water of the substrate, which is emitted as steam from oven stacks.
Wet-on-Wet Finishing The normal practice is to apply finishes to dry fabric.
The drying step can be eliminated by using a wet-on-wet process, in which the substrate comes directly from a previous wet process, and is treated to ensure a very low and even moisture content, thereby eliminating a costly drying step (Figure III-18).
Finish can be applied at a higher wet pick-up (amount of solution retained by the substrate).
During the process, the finish mix tends to be diluted by the water in the incoming substrate.
A control system to sense and adjust the chemical feed to the finish mix saturator is often required.
Fabric Coating Mills should explore the possibility of using water-based--rather than solvent-based--emulsions for fabric coatings.
In many applications, this is a technically feasible substitution.
New forms of materials, such as fiber-reinforced composites, may be a suitable replacement for coated fabrics in some applications.
Powder-coating technology offers a pollution-lowering substitute to waterless systems that some use solvent-based coatings.
Three applications that have been researched are gravure rollers, powder scatter, and paste-point (Figure III-19).
Recycling and Reuse Discharge of mothproofing agents from wool carpet manufacturing is one area of wool finishing that is being regulated to reduce aquatic toxicity.
One possible method for reducing pollution from mothproofing operation is microemulsion spray and centrifugal extraction to remove excess mothproofing treatment solution from wool substrate, followed by recycling of the pesticide solution (Figure III-20).
Using this process can reduce discharges of permethrin to as low as 1.7 grams per ton of wool treated, as compared to 8 grams per ton for conventional hank treatments in dyebaths.
The concentrated residue removed from the centrifuge is returned to the process, thereby reducing the amount that is ultimately released to the environment.
POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 1 of 65 PROCESS 7--PRODUCT FABRICATION Finished cloth or fabric is fabricated into a wide variety of apparel, household, and industrial products.
Textile mills produce some of the simpler products, such as bags, sheets, towels, pillowcases, blankets, and draperies.
However, goods to be made into apparel or the more complex housewares are usually sold to the cutting trades for fabrication.
Numerous factors affect the amount of waste generated in cutting, factors include pattern layout efficiency and the level of expertise of also affected by design and planning decisions, information flow, and product fabrication operations varies with the type of goods being generate the least waste (13 to 16 percent) sewing, and product fabrication operations.
Such cutting and sewing operators.

In general, fabric utilization efficiency in cutting and sewing ranges from about 72 to 94 percent.
In the U.S., about 800 million yards of denim are produced.
The efficiency for cutting denim is typically 84 percent or less.
Therefore, cutting waste therefore represents about 16 percent of denim production.
Carpet mills use mostly synthetic fibers, such as nylon, acrylic, and polyester, but some wool and cotton is also processed.
Operations at a carpet mill may include some or all of the following processes: bleaching, scouring, carbonizing, dyeing, printing resin treatment, waterproofing, flameproofing, soil repellency, and backing with foamed and unfoamed latex or jute.
Carpet backing without other carpet manufacturing may be included in the dry processing mill category.
Some carpet is backed with latex in a separate plant; other carpet mills perform latexing in the same plant in which the finishing is performed.
The yarn is tufted into a woven or synthetic nonwoven polypropylene or jute primary backing in a dry operation.
The tufted carpet is then either printed or dyed.
After dyeing, the carpet is dried in a tunnel dryer.
The carpet is then ready for application of adhesive and secondary backing.
Carpets and rugs are produced from either dyed or undyed yarns, and may receive a secondary backing of either foam and/or woven material.
Processes include heatsetting, tufting (process of attaching carpet yarn to a primary backing material), dyeing, drying, printing (rotary screen/ink-jet replacing flat screen), finishing, and secondary backing (applied with latex).
Industrial fabric scrap, or "edge trim," consists of cut selvage ends, roll-ends, reject lots, set-up yardage, and other waste materials generated during the manufacture of coated and laminated fabrics.
Reprocessing of edge trim is difficult, because industrial fabric end-products are often conjoined hybrid structures.
Coatings are designed to adhere inseparably to their substrates; lamination adhesives are selected for their long-term bonding properties.
Coatings and laminate films are selected to pair with their substrates through complementary physical properties.
This pairing demands that the same polymer is not used for both substrate and top layer, as in vinyl-laminated polyester.
In 1993, the industrial fabric industry generated over 6,000 tons of edge trim.
This translates into an estimated $250,000 in annual disposal costs.
The indirect costs are much greater.
Manufacturing that generates this amount of waste during primary processing is inefficient and uncompetitive in today's global marketplace.
Source Reduction PROCESS MODIFICATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES Recycling Edge Trim Several techniques may be applicable in recycling edge trim waste, including the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cryogenic fracture Powdering (solid-state shearing) Pyrolysis Hydrolysis and alcoholysis Catalysis Biodegradation Thermal processing Infrared surface heating Gamma irradiation file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 6 of 65 Cryogenic fracture uses liquid nitrogen or other cold-temperature materials to reduce polymers to a temperature below their glass transition temperatures, which makes the coatings or films brittle, and easily broken and separated.
Research has shown that additional energy input is required, in the form of mechanical or ultrasonic vibration, to complete the fracturization.
However, unacceptable levels of residual textile fibers are left behind in the reclaimed vinyl, and "gum up" the processing machinery, and making the reclaimed vinyl unsuitable for most applications.
Redesigning the coatings and laminates might lead to ready cryogenic separation without the undesirable residual contamination.
Powdering, or solid-state shear extrusion, of edge trim by low-temperature grinding at high pressures may be a workable method of reducing these composite fabrics for additional processing.
The key element is the use of high pressure combined with low temperatures.
A North Carolina industrial fabric manufacturer has implemented a pilot study to use grinding process--a combination of the two aforementioned processes--that would chloride (PVC)-coated fabric trim waste into reusable plastic resin powder.
This would re and filler purchased, and eliminate the costs of disposing of the PVC trim in landfills CRYO-GRINDÃ¯Â¿Â½ Liquid Nitrogen (LIN) Grinding System was developed by Air Products a new cryogenic freezing and enable it to recycle polyvinyl duce the quantity of virgin resin (see Case Study No. 11).
The of Pennsylvania.
Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of organic material in an oxygen-deficient environment.
Products-To-Oil, Inc., has developed a thermal organic reactor to produce fuels and chemicals from various organic feedstocks, such as waste automobile tires.
The reactor uses molten lead in a sealed chamber to reduce the organic material to its organic residues, without harmful emissions resulting from incomplete combustion.
A conveyor and filter system separates and removes the residue, allowing a continuous feed process.
Edge trim materials, which are thinner and contain more digestible energy than tires, are expected to be readily processible in these reactors.
Versions of the pyrolytic kiln are operating nationwide for commercial tire disposal and electric co-generation.
Hydrolysis and alcoholysis are chemical processes that are used to reduce polymers to their constituent monomers.
Catalysis involves the use of additive or accelerating agents that are not used up during the chemical reaction.
Biological organisms can, and have been tailored to, break down specific synthetic chemicals, such as the oil-eating microbes (bioremediation).
Thermal processing involves applying heat to melt the polymers into their constituent parts.
Unfortunately, this method is not very effective for materials having specific melting point properties, such as polyester and vinyl.
However, selective heating through microwaves can be used to impregnate one of the polymers or the lamination adhesive with a heat-absorbing powder to speed the separation process.
Infrared surface heating of the fabric surfaces to loosen coatings or adhesives may prove effective if integrated into the production process, in which layers would be separated immediately after they were trimmed from the roll.
Gamma irradiation might induce favorable changes in the structure of some coated and laminated fabrics, such as increasing crosslinking in certain polymers.
Exposure to the nonionizing radiation would not cause the fabric to become radioactive.
IMPROVED OPERATING PRACTICES Pattern Marker Efficiency Pattern marker efficiency is critical in reducing the amount of cutting room waste, but it depends strongly on garment design factors, such as shape and seam location, size assortment required by retail sales, fabric width, and other technical considerations.
Cutting practices that minimize waste in view of these factors are well known, and material utilization departments are skilled at optimizing cutting efficiency.
Waste minimization in this area is a highly developed science, and many operations use sophisticated computer algorithms and other techniques.
Improvements can be made through design modifications or better planning, such as coordination of fabric suppliers and retailers.
Carpet Manufacturing file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION P2 opportunities that have been implemented in carpet manufacturing include the following: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Page 7 of 65 Reducing size of tufting dyeheader samples (yarn QC check) from 1 yard to 8 inches, a savings of 80 percent Reducing "runout," during tufting yarn changeovers, to a minimum distance, resulting in an average savings of about 25 inches of carpet Converting from lap to butt seams in carpets, which can reduce seam waste by 50 percent Improving worker training and attention to cutting (straighter cuts reduce trimming waste prior to seaming), and width control in tufting and printing Minimizing excessively large samples for testing, as for flammability Ã¯Â¿Â½ Recycling and Reuse Seam trimmings, selvage pieces, and cut-outs can be collected and segregated in an organized manner to facilitate recycle and reuse.
If properly handled, these waste materials can often be sold as raw materials for textile-related production activities.
Suggestions for reducing labor costs while increasing resale value include (1) using traversing wind-ups to form neat rolls of trimmings with standard dimensions, and (2) segregating cut-outs and selvage by fabric type.
Latex Recovery in Carpet Manufacturing Latex is an expensive discarded, causing a manufacturers.
Benefi is an excellent process material that is used in carpet manufacturing.
The latex-laden stream is too dilute to reuse and is color and BOD problem.
Recovering latex by UF is a standard operation for many carpet ts of latex recovery include lower total use of latex and BOD reduction.
Additionally, the permeate for cleaning water, because it is loaded with surfactant.
Reuse of Cutting Room Fibers At present, denim cutting waste is recycled into end-uses, such as paper making.
The value of this fiber in such cases is not as high as its value in denim manufacturing.
Manufacturing procedures must be developed to reclaim fiber from denim cutting waste and reuse it, thereby reducing the cost of the raw fiber and dyeing requirements, which would also reduce the pollution associated with dyeing, because the indigo denim color would already exist in the reclaimed fiber.
Recycling of Polyester from Fabric Waste The Department of Textile Technology at Anna University in Madras, India, conducted research to recycle polyester from polyester/cotton blended fabric waste (tailoring bits).
The fabric waste is boiled with soda and soap to remove the impurities and is then carbonized with 70 percent sulfuric acid to remove the cotton component.
The polyester fibers are mechanically separated from the wastes by using a licker-in type opener, or shirley analyzer.
Recovered fibers are characterized and hand-spun into yarns, which are used as weft and woven with 100 percent cotton warp on a handloom.
Fabrics can be used as furnishings material.
Nonwovens prepared with these fibers can be used as floor coverings, table mats, filter pads, backing, and packing material.
Work is also progressing to recover polyester by chemical and thermal dissolution techniques.
Prior to polyester recovery, the cotton component is acetylated and recovered in the powder form.
The resulting polyester powder can be used to produce engineering plastics and monofilaments.
Recycling of Carpet and Floor Coverings BASF has established a program in which carpets made of postdyed and predyed BASF nylon are backstamped at the mill.
At the end of the useful life of the carpet, the end-user may return the carpet to a BASF collection point, after which BASF will recycle the fiber for other products.

Recycling Automobile Seatbelts Akzo Faser of Germany manufactures polymers and uses them to make specialized yarns for industrial applications.
In 1993, the German government issued a directive requiring plastic materials used in automobiles to be recycled at a rate of 20 percent by 1996, and 50 percent by 2000.
Included in the plastics category were seatbelts manufactured of spun-dyed black yarn; the yarn type was DiolenÃ¯Â¿Â½ Polyester 177/178T/56.
Akzo initiated a seatbelt recycling program.
Stoppers, tags, and seams removed from the seatbelts to eliminate any materials other than polyester.
Glass fiber, in the form of injection-molding granules, was fabricated from regranulated raw material, or used seatbelts.
The glass fiber was spun into high-tenacity filament yarns dyed with carbon black, and refabricated into seatbelt webbing.
The quality of the reprocessed yarn was comparable to original yarn made of virgin raw material.
Recycling and Reuse of Apparel Postconsumer recycling of discarded blue jeans or other denim products could be combined with technology to reuse cutting room denim waste.
U.S. denim producers and apparel manufacturers dispose of an estimated 70 million pounds of denim scrap in landfills each year.
Attempting to reprocess fibers consisting of 100 percent garnetted denim poses significant quality barriers.
However, the International Textile Center at Texas Tech University investigated adding quantities of low-grade Pima cotton as a "sweetener," or carrier fiber, to produce a blend level that would foster the processing of reclaimed fiber into acceptable denim fabrics.
Using Pima cotton as a carrier enabled rotor spinning of the garnetted, recycled cotton fabric.
A blend consisting of 70 percent reclaimed fiber and 30 percent Pima cotton experienced the greatest success during processing.
Quality characteristics of the recycled denim fell within the Levi Strauss acceptable ranges.
Martin Color-Fi has developed a process that grinds, melts, and extrudes polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from plastic bottles to produce fiber for use in carpets, rugs, home furnishings, apparel, and automotive and industrial fabrics.
Because the polymer used in beverage bottles is of a higher grade than that found in virgin polyester fiber, NatureTex, which is Martin's trademarked 100 percent recycled PET, features attributes that other fibers have been unable to match.
Burlington manufactures Reused Denim made of 50 percent denim scraps and Tencel denim, which is manufactured by using a nonchemical solvent spinning process in which the dissolving agent is recycled, thereby eliminating all environmentally harmful effluent.
Burlington also introduced Bottle Blue Denim, which contains a recycled fiber called EcoSpun, which Wellman, Inc., manufactures from recycled PET bottles.
Lee Apparel and Swift Textiles have initiated a cooperative effort with plastic recyclers.
Their new line of Soda Pop Denim consists of 80 percent cotton and 20 percent PET from recycled plastic soft drink bottles.
Each pair of jeans contains the equivalent of two large soda pop bottles.
Soda Pop Denim can be used for both apparel and nonapparel products.
Other efforts include transforming worn-out garments into wiping rags.
Old clothing is the most readily reused and/or recycled residentially generated textile category.
State and/or local mandates to recycle a percentage of this waste stream are providing the impetus to add new materials to existing collection programs.
Current waste characterization studies do not distinguish between recyclable, or marketable, and nonrecyclable textiles.
During 1990, textiles comprised about 5.3 percent of the discarded municipal solid waste in the U.S.
About one-third of the total textiles disposed are recyclable.
Marketable textiles include old clothing, bedding materials, towels, furniture cushions, carets, nylon, shower curtains, and oily rags from garages.
Historically, most textiles collected in the U.S. are reused in their original form for their intended function.
Used clothing is generally collected, sorted, wholesaled by the pound or piece, and retailed to the general public mainly in developing countries.
Ripped or stained items may be sold for rugmaking, auto insulation, wiping rags, or blanketmaking.
In Germany, a recycling company collects selected textiles and shoes nationally.
Many of these items are thrown away, file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 9 of 65 not because they are worn out, but because they are no longer fashionable or they no longer fit.
Materials are exported for sale to countries in the developing world, and a small proportion is given to relief organizations for emergency situations.
Alternative uses for unwearable clothing and shoes include incineration and the manufacture of insulation board from granulated shoes.

(Bloomsburg), scours, dyes, and finishes about 22 million yards of fabric each year.
The basic flow of material through the plant begins with the scouring of incoming greige and yarn-dyed fabrics.
The scoured fabric is then jet-dyed at high temperature and pressure.
The application of a chemical or mechanical finish is the last process before the fabric is shipped to cutting and sewing facilities.Bloomsburg has actively pursued and implemented waste reduction and recycling programs throughout all production processes.
These programs were implemented in response to increased landfill fees and regulatory requirements and as part of the membership requirements of the American Textile Manufacturer Institute's Encouraging Environmental Excellence Program.
Waste Reduction Activities Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Most of the greige or yarn-dyed goods arrive at the plant in polyethylene plastic bags.
Bloomsburg purchased a baler to compact this material for shipping to a recycler.
Bloomsburg cuts the length of rolled paper tubes used to handle greige goods during the set-making process to reduce the width of the final product, and then uses the tubes to ship the finished goods to cutting and sewing operations.
Racks and containers are located at the work stations so that operators can sort plastic bags and paper tubes as the waste is generated; this sorting eliminates the need for a resorting step later in the waste management process.
Many of the chemicals used in the scouring and dyeing operations arrived in fiber drums that were shipped to the landfill.
Currently, chemicals used in large quantities are brought to the plant in reusable tote tanks, which are returned to the vendor after consumption.
Chemicals used in smaller quantities are supplied in reusable plastic drums.
Bloomsburg Mills, Inc.
(SIC 2269) Chemical Substitution, Equipment Upgrade, Recycling Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Tetrachloroethylene, biphenyl, and trichlorobenzene are constituents of the dye carrier chemicals that are used to promote level dyeing.
Tetrachloroethylene and biphenyl usage exceeded reporting requirements listed under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III, Section 313.
In an effort to reduce regulatory burdens, Bloomsburg has discussed the elimination of these chemicals with supply vendors, who substituted a dye carrier containing methyl naphthalene and Rule 66 solvents (Rule 66 solvents are designated as nonphotochemically-reactive and, therefore, are exempt from most reporting requirements).
This dye carrier subsequently reduced the release of the hazardous air pollutants.
Also, the company substituted a solvent containing isopropanol and heptane as a suitable spotwashing alternative for 1,1,1-trichloroethane, another hazardous air pollutant.
No loss of quality was noted with either of the substitutions.
All cloth seam cuts and small waste rags are baled and shipped for recycling.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 13 of 65 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Aluminum cans are collected and donated to local Boy Scout troops.
Process heat and water is conserved throughout the facility.
During the scouring process, water is conserved by using a countercurrent washing procedure on the scouring range.
The cleaner wash water enters the exit wash unit and counterflows back toward the dirtier units.
Countercurrent washing provides a more efficient, cleaner wash and requires less water.
During the dyeing process, cooling water is used to cool the jet dyeing machines.
After passing through heat exchangers, the heated water is used in initial baths and washing in other stages of the process, thereby reducing consumption of heating fuel.
Instrumentation and process controls for the dyeing process were upgraded from manual to computer control.
The controlled time of the wash after dyeing has significantly reduced consumption of heating fuel and usage of water.
Waste Reduction Results The dye carrier substitution reduced emissions of tetrachloroethylene, a hazardous air pollutant, by 91 percent--from 64,713 pounds in 1988 to 5,932 pounds in 1993.
The computerized automation system on the dyeing process has reduced water consumption by 28 percent and fuel consumption by 15.9 percent.
As a result of the reuse and recycling programs, solid waste disposal from the plant fell 85 percent, from 3,744 cubic yards in 1993 to 560 cubic yards in 1994.
By receiving and storing process chemicals in reusable totes and plastic drums, the company eliminated the disposal of 50 drums to the landfill each week.
The following table presents a breakdown of the quantity of material diverted from the landfill and the cost savings realized from eliminated disposal costs and resale of the collected material.
Costs No information is available concerning costs.
file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Annual Savings Page 14 of 65 Annual savings realized by Bloomsburg, through the implementation of its waste reduction and recycling programs, are as follows: Waste Diverted From Landfills (tons) 40.6 36.4 (52 bales) 20 (32 bales) 0.8 21.2 30 TOTAL 149 Landfill Savings ($) 1,218 1,092 600 24 636 900 4,470 Sales Revenue From Recycling ($) 954 0 800 0 0 33,000 34,754 Item Paperboard Rags Plastics Aluminum Fiber drums Paper tubes By diverting 149 tons of waste from the landfill, and after subtracting the cost of strapping, the company realized $38,881 in disposal costs savings and recycling revenue.
This figure does not include savings from reduced consumption of water and fuel oil.
file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 15 of 65 CASE STUDY NO. 2--Textile Manufacturing Industry: Pollution Prevention Application: Background Cleveland Mills Company (Cleveland) manufactures knit fabric for apparel end-use--mainly jersey and mesh knits.
About 330,000 pounds of material are knitted, dyed, finished, and shipped from the facility each week.
Cleveland's waste reduction program has significantly reduced wastewater releases, air emissions, and solid and hazardous waste streams.
Waste Reduction Activities Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cleveland's solid waste reduction program centers around an on-site recycling center.
Materials recycled include corrugated cardboard, cardboard tubes and cones, paper, plastics, and wooden pallets.
The plastic recyclable material consists of cones, tubes, bagging, strapping, and bale wraps.
Yarn manufacturing waste, yarn mill card waste, knitting rags, and finishing rags are collected and baled; they are then sold to a textile waste recycler.
Office paper and scrap metal are also collected for recycling.
Cleveland has converted to bulk or tote chemical storage systems.
All drums, and metal containers are returned to the suppliers.
Purchasing its own bulk storage enabled the company to purchase chemicals at volume prices, reduce the number of landfill, and prevent numerous minor spills.
Also, the wooden pallets arriving at returned to suppliers, reused to ship goods to customers, or recycled.
the fiber, plastic, and and tote stations has containers sent to the the facility are either Cleveland Mills Company (SIC 2261) Recycling, Chemical Substitution, Equipment Upgrades Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Salt brine replaced sodium sulfate in the dyeing operation.
By installing a brine water mixing and distribution system, the company prevented 17,000 pounds of previously unrecyclable sodium sulfate bags from entering the waste stream.
Cleveland has also reduced the concentration of pollutants in the wastewater.
After high-pollutant-loading chemicals were targeted for optimization and substitution through a chemical evaluation program, the company subsequently reduced pollutant loading to the treatment plant.
By upgrading the wastewater treatment system, the facility significantly reduced loadings of biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS) to the First Broad River.
The upgrade involved improved flow control throughout the entire system, which resulted in increased detention time in the contact chamber.
The longer detention time, in turn, improved the sludge handling and dewatering systems.
The company also installed an outlet diffuser to facilitate additional pollutant breakdown and reduce the possibility of toxicity problems in the river.
Cleveland substantially reduced formaldehyde air emissions from the manufacturing process by using low-shade resins that contain a lower percentage of the chemical; quality and performance levels were not compromised by the substitution.
Air emissions from the facility were further improved by replacing the coal-fired boilers with cleaner natural gas-fired boilers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Waste Reduction Results Mainly by diverting waste materials to recycling markets, Cleveland reduced the quantity of solid waste sent to the landfill by 50 percent, or 600,000 pounds, between 1991 and 1994.
By 1994, Cleveland was recycling 79 percent of its solid waste stream.
By optimizing and substituting pollutant chemicals, and upgrading the wastewater treatment system, the company reduced BOD, COD, and TSS by 50, 24, and 60 percent, respectively.
file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 16 of 65 Cleveland projects that formaldehyde emissions to the air will drop by 84 percent, from 3,600 to 580 pounds per year, as a result of the switch to low-shade change resins in the production process.
In addition to reducing air emissions, with the installation of the natural gas-fired boilers, each year the company will eliminate 220,000 pounds of fly ash that was generated by the coal-fired boilers.

Annual Savings No information concerning annual savings was available.
file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 17 of 65 CASE STUDY NO. 3--Screen Printing Industry: T.S. Designs, Inc.
(SIC 2399) Pollution Prevention Application: Water Conservation, Chemical Substitution, Recycling Background T.S. Designs (TSD) is a textile screen printing facility that employs 70 people.
The company processes about 4.5 million T-shirts, sweatshirts, socks, and piece goods each year on seven automatic screen printing presses.
In addition to conducting the actual screen printing process, TSD prepares all of its screens.
Screen preparation involves computerized production of the artwork, preparation of color separation, and production of the film positives at the company's on-site photographic darkroom.
The polyester screen is covered with emulsion.
For the actual screens, film positives are placed on top of the polyester screen and exposed to light.
After the screens have been used for printing, they are cleaned and reclaimed.
A few years ago, TSD became concerned with the adverse impact that the company and the entire screen printing industry may have on the environment.
The company undertook several programs in an effort to diminish the environmental impact of its operations.
Waste Reduction Activities Ã¯Â¿Â½ After a screen printing production run, the screens are rinsed in a reclamation tank to remove any emulsion from the screen mesh.
Haze and stains are then removed in a tank that contains a concentrated alkaline cleaning solution.
Degreasing, the final cleaning process, is accomplished with detergent and water.
Previously, chemicals were only used once before being washed down the drain.
The screens were reclaimed with Autostrip Powder, a strong oxidizing solution, which was wiped onto the screens with a sponge and then removed with a power washer.
Water and chemicals both went down the drain after being used only once, even though the chemicals were not exhausted.
To reduce chemical consumption, the company installed a 43-gallon reclamation tank to continually filter and circulate the cleaning solution past the screen suspended in the reclamation tank.
This new method effectively removed the emulsion, and the reclaiming solution can now be used continuously for about 1 month.
These modifications resulted in both a large reduction in the quantity of reclaimer used and, as a less concentrated solution was required, use of a less hazardous cleaner (CPS Liquid Stencil Remover).
For the stain and haze removal process, screens were rinsed in ICC 757 Ghost/Haze Remover prior to degreasing.
This chemical contained hazardous components and was flammable.
With the installation of another holding tank, a less hazardous and flammable solution, which comprises equal parts of water and Easi-Solv 201, can be used.
This modification has extended solution lifetime such that it is added only to compensate for evaporation and spillage.
With the installation of a holding tank, all water previously used in the degreasing process, which went down the drain, is now supplemented with city water if needed, and is saved, and recycled for use in the reclamation cleaning process.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The company formerly used platen adhesives to affix garments to print platens.
These adhesives are generally solvent-based and release significant quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere.
Until 1992, TSD used about 4,800 cans of solvent-based aerosol platen adhesive each year.
The company plans to eliminate the use of these solvents in 1995 by substituting a water-based adhesive.
The water-based adhesive system involves purchasing the solution in bulk quantities and applying it to the platens with an automated spray apparatus.
Aside from eliminating a source of VOCs, purchase of adhesive in bulk is markedly cheaper than in individual cans.
In the past, used fixer and silver thiosulfate generated in the company darkroom was poured down the drain.
By installing a simple ion-exchange silver recovery unit, the company now receives some of the profits from reclamation of the silver metal.
In the first year of operation, about 67 troy ounces of Ã¯Â¿Â½ file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 18 of 65 unrefined silver were recovered.
Therefore, potentially toxic silver was kept out of the sewer system, and the company realized an additional source of revenue.
Waste Reduction Results Since the holding tanks for water and cleaning chemical reuse were implemented, water usage at TSD has fallen by about 650 gallons per week, and consumption of reclaiming solution has dropped 75 percent.
The haze remover chemicals have never been replaced except to compensate for losses from splashing, runoff, or evaporation.
Costs See summary table under Annual Savings.

Its Lumberton, North Carolina, facility employs about 1,000 people, and 1994 production totaled 38,255,000 pounds of knit fabrics for the clothing market.
The knit fabrics production process involves knitting, dyeing, and finishing operations.
Waste Reduction Activities In accordance with the company's proactive environmental policy, Westpoint Stevens implemented a range of P2 programs at the Lumberton facility.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The company was classed as regulatory burden associated alternate chemicals that emit the finishing chemicals emitt replaced with cleaner natural a major emissions source under Title V of the Clean Air Act.
To reduce the with this classification, the company contacted chemical vendors to obtain fewer hazardous air pollutants.
These negotiations reduced the quantity of ed from the plant.
Emissions were further reduced when No. 6 fuel oil was gas as boiler fuel.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jet-dyeing machinery was upgraded to low-liquor-ratio machines with shorter cycles.
This modification reduced usage of chemicals, water, and energy.
Extensive recycling operations are conducted at the plant for plastic cones, plastic, cardboard cones, wooden pallets, cotton wipes, and scrap cloth.
Eleven bulk storage tanks were installed onsite to store process chemicals.
Through negotiations with vendors, wooden pallets and 55-gallon shipping drums are now returned to the suppliers.
This policy alleviates the need to maintain a storage location for these items onsite and conserves landfill space.
Cardboard spinning tubes were unrecyclable, because heavy glues are used to manufacture them.
These tubes were replaced with recyclable polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cones, which not only last five times longer but can be recycled when they wear out.
new chemical must be approved by a committee use, financial feasibility, employee safety, and enabled the company to (1) choose alternative find dyestuffs that offer lower concentrations of for storage and employee handling.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Westpoint Stevens has adopted a chemical approval process, wherein any before it is used in the plant.
Chemicals are evaluated for functional environmental and waste treatment impact.
The approval process has chemicals without toxic ingredients that may harm the Lumber River, (2) heavy metal, and (3) avoid using chemicals that are considered dangerous Waste Reduction Results Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Chemical substitutions and the conversion to natural gas for boiler fuel resulted in the company's reclassification as a minor source under Title V. Upgrades of dye machinery decreased consumption of dye chemicals by 60 to 70 percent.
From 1991 to 1994, total pounds of solid waste landfilled fell by 39 percent, from 882 tons to 540 tons.
A similar improvement was evident in the percentage of solid waste recycled--2,280 tons of material were recycled in 1994, which was an increase from 55 to 75 percent of all solid waste generated.
Costs No information concerning costs was available.
file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 21 of 65 Annual Savings The company has not calculated the savings from the new equipment and chemical substitution, but the savings from increased recycling efforts from 1991 through 1993 were $7,692.
In 1994 alone, the company collected over $160,000 in revenue from recycling efforts.

The wastewater discharged from the dyeing process to the publicly-owned treatment works (POTW) in Henderson, North Carolina, results in high levels of BOD, COD, and ammonia (NH3-N).
As requirements by the State of North Carolina, concerning the levels of pollutants entering the city's waste treatment system, became more stringent, Americal responded with efforts to develop methods of reducing levels of the pollutants.
Waste Reduction Activities A survey of the dyeing plant revealed several areas in which changes could be made: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Oil and grease discharges were reduced through improved accuracy in monitoring and testing the oil levels in the nylon yarns.
In the dyeing process, acid dyes, disperse dyes, and softening chemicals are used.
To help reduce the levels of pollutants, Americal investigated four dye manufacturers and five auxiliary chemical manufacturers and determined which products had the least amount of BOD, COD, and NH3-N. These products were implemented in the dyeing process.
Americal also experimented with temperature regulation schemes.
In testing for optimum temperatures, Americal discovered that, at 180Ã¯Â¿Â½F with a 15-minute extension period, the dye exhausted more completely.
More importantly, this temperature allowed for a reduction in chemical use, which, in turn, resulted in lower BOD, COD, and NH3-N bath levels.
To pretreat its waste water, Americal converted a cement tank into an aerated equalization basin that allowed for reduction in pollutant levels of effluent.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Waste Reduction Results Following is a comparison of average effluent levels (milligrams per liter [mg/L]) recorded before and after the grant study: Parameter BOD COD NH3-N Costs No information concerning costs was available.
Annual Savings Because of these reductions, Americal has saved about $35,000 annually on waste treatment surcharges levied by the City Before Study (mg/L) 1,120 3,200 45 Current Tests (City of Henderson) (mg/L) 460 1,850 1 file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION of Henderson.

file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 24 of 65 CASE STUDY NO. 6--Acrylic Yarn Production Industry: Amital Spinning Corporation (SIC 2281) Pollution Prevention Application: Water Conservation and Reuse, Solid Waste Reduction, Energy Conservation Background Amital Spinning Corporation (Amital) produces packaged, custom-dyed, high-bulk acrylic yarn for the textile industry.
To achieve significant energy and cost savings, Amital has combined a process water reuse system with a solid waste recycling system.
Waste Reduction Activities Ã¯Â¿Â½ To reuse and conserve process water, Amital collected noncontact cooling water to use in the color kitchen for the preparation of dye liquors.
Using this water allows the dye liquors to be prepared at high temperatures, thereby reducing steam requirements during dyeing.
Process water is recovered, and the expended chemicals are replenished.
These changes reduce water and energy consumption and costs.
Other savings include reductions in (1) the quantity of batch chemicals, and (2) the time required for heating, by 8 to 10 minutes per cycle.
Amital also increased its profitability by implementing a solid wastewater recycling and reuse program for various cardboard, metal, plastic, and acrylic fiber components.
Waste products are recycled back to the same process or sold through an outside market.
Disposal costs for these recyclables are, therefore, avoided.
A baler was installed to facilitate program operation.
Of 1.1 million pounds of solid waste generated in 1992, the company recycled about 933,000 pounds.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Waste Reduction Results From 1988 to 1992, Amital reduced the amount of wastewater generated per pound of yarn from 19.34 gallons to 3.19 gallons.
Average daily wastewater volume was reduced from 320,000 gallons to 112,000 gallons, and production increased from 12 to more than 25 batches of yarn per day.
Through the recycling program, the solid waste stream destined for disposal was reduced by 933,000 pounds per year, or an annual solid waste reduction of about 80 percent.
Costs No information concerning costs was available.
Annual Savings In 1992, Amital's savings totaled about $800,000, from (1) avoiding solid waste disposal costs, (2) reducing water use ( $185,000), and (3) reducing energy use ($500,000).
Amital is also saving about $45 per batch in chemicals.
The company netted about $100,000 revenue through its solid waste recycling and reuse program.
file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 25 of 65 CASE STUDY NO. 7--Spun Cotton Yarn Manufacturing Industry: Harriet 
(SIC 2342) Pollution Prevention Application: Recycling and Reuse Background Harriet 
(HHY), manufactures spun cotton yarn at (1) four plants in Henderson, North Carolina, (2) two plants in Clarkton, North Carolina, and (3) one plant in Summerville, Georgia.
Part of the manufacturing process involves cleaning the raw cotton to remove bits of crushed cotton stalks and seeds, dust, and short cotton fibers.
All of this cleaning by-product was formerly baled and sent to the local landfill.
The four Henderson plants generate 80 bales (44,000 pounds) of the cleaning by-product per week.
Landfilling the material costs about $10.00 per bale in Vance County.
Waste Reduction Activities HHY sought alternative ways to use or manage the material to avoid landfilling.
By modifying the cleaning operations so that more of the short fibers could be recovered, HHY is currently selling about 5,300 pounds per week (10 bales) to textile by-product brokers at 1.5 cents per pound.
After modifications have been completed at all plants, HHY expects to sell 16,000 pounds per week.
Agents with the Vance County Cooperative Extension Office advised that the material has potential uses in agriculture, including the following: (1) as a soil amendment and nutrient source for crops, (2) as a soil stabilizer for erosion control, and (3) as a feed source for livestock.
To research and test these applications, HHY received a Challenge Grant from NCDEHNR's Pollution Prevention Program to evaluate these potential uses.
HHY matched the grant with its own funds.
The by-product can feasibly be used as a soil amendment to supplement commercial fertilizer or as a soil stabilizer to replace wheat straw and asphalt, but it must first be milled to permit even distribution for either of these applications.
The most promising of the alternative uses was as a feed source for livestock.
Cotton by-products--such as cottonseed hulls and cottonseed meal--are already widely used as livestock feed ingredients.
Feeding studies by animal nutrition specialists at North Carolina State University revealed that the cleaning by-product is comparable to low-quality hay.
Hay of this quality has a value of about 1.5 cents per pound, but the HHY policy is to provide the by-product to interested livestock producers at no charge.
HHY currently distributes an average of 20 680-pound bales per week, and there is a waiting list of farmers requesting this free feed.
After further modifications, the company expects to be able to supply 50 bales per week.
The success at HHY has been advertised among Cooperative Extension personnel across the state, and other cotton processors have begun to evaluate the potential to use their cleaning by-products for cattle feed.
Waste Reduction Results HHY eliminates about 80 bales (44,000 pounds) of the cleaning by-product per week by selling it to textile by-product brokers.
Costs No information concerning costs was available.
Annual Savings Annual savings in landfilling costs are estimated at $41,600.
Annual revenue generated by the sale of short fibers to textile by-product brokers is estimated at $12,480.

(SIC 2252) Pollution Prevention Application: Solid Waste Reduction, Recycling Background The cotton and blended hosiery manufacturing process at Neuville Industries, Inc.
(Neuville), consists of knitting, dyeing, and boarding the hosiery products.
Using fabrics and chemicals, that are used in this process and in fabric processing, produces large solid waste streams that comprise cardboard, plastic, paper cones, and polybags for packaging.
Waste Reduction Activities Neuville established a recycling committee to evaluate, organize, and implement solid waste reduction techniques to reduce the cost burden of solid waste disposal.
The committee--which comprised the facility safety inspector and members of the housekeeping, accounting, knitting and seaming, and training staffs--first established a recycling program in 1990.
To spark immediate awareness of the need for recycling and facilitate employee involvement, the committee organized an employee suggestion program.
Following is a summary of the programs implemented to recycle office, purchasing, and processing wastes.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Office and Break Room Waste A "bag it" program, in cooperation with Garbage Disposal Systems (GDS), to handle paper and aluminum can waste, including color-coded waste cans to ensure effective separation of different paper grades Ã¯Â¿Â½ Purchasing Waste Cardboard recycling program, in cooperation with GDS Plastic cone recycling program in cooperation with GDS Selling paper cones Reuse of most shipping pallets in plant Ã¯Â¿Â½ Processing Waste Donation of hosiery toe clippings to interested parties The recycling committee is seeking other recycling programs for additional waste streams such as polybags from packaging, knitting oils, and some plastic cones that GDS will not accept.

(SIC 2250) Pollution Prevention Application: Process Modification, Chemical Reuse Background Riddle Fabrics, Inc.
(RFI), uses a bleaching process in the manufacture of cotton label tape for the garment industry.
Because the bleaching bath is frequently dumped, and chemicals are used in other systems, the level of BOD exceeds compliance limits.
RFI invited representatives of the State of North Carolina Pollution Prevention Program (PPP) to survey the plant's operation and provide information on waste reduction opportunities.
After the site visit, PPP prepared a report in which it outlined several options for process modifications and housekeeping methods that could help reduce the pollutant levels.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ By using the same vat for bleaching and rinsing, RFI was able to reuse the rinse bath for bleaching purposes but needed to discharge the bleach bath frequently.
Following PPP's suggestion, RFI installed a holding bin for the bleach bath, which is contained in the bin during the rinsing stage and is pumped back into the vat before the rinse bath is removed.
Through titration, the bleach bath concentration is analyzed and reconstituted as needed.
This process modification has reduced BOD levels to within compliance limits, and water usage has also decreased.
Waste Reduction Results RFI has reduced its BOD levels from 842 mg/L to 400 mg/L.
Water usage has decreased by 5,000 gallons per year.
Costs No information concerning costs was available.
Annual Savings The plant has realized $1,650 in annual savings from reductions in chemical and water usage and wastewater treatment surcharges.
RFI also benefits from avoiding permit fines.

(SIC 2331) Pollution Prevention Application: Process Modification, Chemical Substitution Background Ti-Caro, Inc.
(TCI), is a textile manufacturing company that produces dyed and finished fabrics.
Pollutant levels (320 mg/L) in the effluent discharged exceeded compliance limits (300 mg/L) set by the City of Newton.
To reduce these levels, the company studied several areas of process modification.
Waste Reduction Activities Through this research, TCI found that, by pretreating the wastewater in an aeration tank outside the plant and using sulfuric acid to neutralize the liquid, it could reduce the pollutant levels, but it could not reduce them enough to comply with limits.
TCI implemented several source reductions options to further reduce the pollutants.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ TCI now requires environmental impact statements on all knitting oils, softeners, winding emulsions, dyes, and other chemicals before putting them into production.
Fabrics are bleached by a pad batch process that reduces quantities of chemicals and water.
All exhaust dyeing systems are run with reduced liquor ratios of 10:1.
Peroxide added to any reduction bath is tested for total kill before the bath is dumped.
Further research showed that, during the dyeing process, TCI used 17 to 27 gallons of water less per pound of cloth than other similar manufacturers, for the following reasons: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Double-loading of machines Running of low-liquor dyeing equipment Combining of processes (scour and dye in the same bath) Minimizing of prebleaching of shades when possible Because TCI uses so little water, its BOD concentration was higher than other similar mills, although the total BOD loading was lower.
The low volume of water used contributes significantly to the high levels of BOD in the waste stream.
For this reason, the City of Newton granted an increase of the limit for BOD to 340 mg/L.
Waste Reduction Results Through this research, TCI has reduced chemical use and the pollutant levels in the wastewater effluent.
Costs No information concerning costs was available.
Annual Savings The process modifications and chemical substitutions have saved money for TCI .
However, the increase in compliance limits, which resulted from current water saving practices, accounted for most of the savings.
file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 29 of 65 CASE STUDY NO. 11--PVC-Coated Fabric Finishing Industry: Athol Corporation Pollution Prevention Application: Recycling Background Athol Corporation (Athol) produces a waste by-product stream, consisting of PVC-coated fabric, that results from the trimming process of several PVC-coated fabric finished products.
In 1994, 115,000 pounds of this trim waste were directly disposed of in the Granville County Landfill, occupying valuable landfill space at a total disposal cost of $1,610 for Athol.
If the trim waste could be recovered, and the total product could be recycled, landfill disposal would no longer be necessary.
This would also reduce the overall demand for virgin PVC resin and calcium carbonate filler.
Conserving valuable landfill space and reducing the demand for PVC resin and filler, while simultaneously meeting stringent product quality goals in a cost-effective manner, makes this project appealing both environmentally and financially.
Additionally, if successful, this process could be used in other commercial applications in the plastic and textile industries, wherever pulverized plastic products can be reintroduced into the manufacturing process.
Waste Reduction Activities To implement this recycling program, Athol evaluated treatment options, with the help of a firm specializing in powder processing and bulk material handling engineering.
Considering the characteristics of the trim waste stream and the overall recycling goals, Athol chose a cryogenic freezing and grinding process that would reduce the PVC trim waste from its original state into a powder form of no greater than 45 microns in diameter.
This powder could then be introduced into the production lines as a replacement for virgin PVC resin and filler.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The CRYO-Grind system consists of a liquid nitrogen (LIN), flow-controlled storage and injection cooling system that cryogenically cools the trim material to -320Ã¯Â¿Â½F as it is conveyed from the trim hopper feed to the hammer impact mill for grinding.
This cooling embrittles the trim material and eliminates the material's resistance to grinding.
The hammer impact mill, which is also cryogenically cooled, is constructed of all stainless steel.
The hammer mill action reduces the embrittled trim to fine particles by impacting the material against a fine mesh screen until the particle size of the material is smaller than the pore size of the mesh.
Depending on the production need for virgin PVC, particles would then be conveyed to bulk storage for recycling or used immediately.
Steps required to implement the trim waste recycling project include the following: 1.
Pilot-scale testing with various trim waste types at the Hosokow Micron Powder Systems Laboratory in Summit, New Jersey - To determine the LIN coolant requirements to treating trim wastes - To determine the behavior of the trim waste during cryogenic treatment and grinding - To determine whether adequate reduction of particle size is possible during grinding 2.

Specification of equipment and modification of the plant to prepare for installation Installation of the LIN CRYO-GRIND system and full-scale testing Implementation of plant-wide trim recycling program It is expected that the trim waste stream will lend itself to this recycling program and be suitable for reuse.
The reduction of a key waste stream, the avoidance of landfill disposal, and savings realized from reduced PVC resin and filler demand make the potential for this program worthwhile and offset the cost of equipment and implementation.

To assist these manufacturers, EPA established Waste Minimization Assessment Centers (WMAC) at selected universities, and adapted procedures from the EPA Waste Minimization Opportunity Assessment Manual (EPA/625/7-88/003, July 1988).
That document has been superseded by the Facility Pollution Prevention Guide (EPA/600/R-92/088, May 1992).
The WMAC team at the University of Tennessee performed an assessment at a plant that prewashes denim jeans prior to retail sale.
This plant prewashes predyed denim jeans for wear modification prior to retail sale.
This plant processes over 7 million pairs of jeans annually.
Predyed jeans are received from other facilities and washed.
An abrasive material is used in some of the wash loads.
Some of the jeans are processed in tumblers to give the jeans a faded appearance.
After processing, the jeans are dried, inspected, mended, pressed, packaged, and shipped.
The assessment team's report, which detailed the team's findings and recommendations, indicated that (1) the waste generated in the greatest quantity is wastewater from the washers and tumblers, and (2) the greatest cost savings could be realized by installing an on-site wastewater treatment plant.
Waste Reduction Activities Existing or recommended P2 opportunities for this plant are as follows: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Containers in which the jeans are received are disassembled and shipped back to the supplier for reuse.
Pumice of an acceptable size is reused. file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Ã¯Â¿Â½ Page 31 of 65 Install an on-site wastewater treatment plant to treat spent water from the washing and tumbling operations.
Reuse treated water.
If this opportunity is implemented, a nonhazardous sludge will be generated.
During the next washing cycle, reuse rinse waters used in the washing operations.
To recover additional pumice stones for reuse, install a screen over the Dumpster that is used to collect pumice from the hydrosieve and the shaker screen.
Install plastic shrouds to reduce pumice lost in the space between the housings and drums in the tumblers.
To reduce sewer charges, meter the wastewater leaving the plant.
Currently, the plant's sewer charges are based on the amount of water purchased rather than the amount of water sewered.
During washing, the jeans absorb a significant amount of water, which is subsequently removed during drying.
There are also other water losses from spills and steam pressing.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Waste Reduction Results Installing the on-site wastewater treatment plant would provide an estimated annual waste reduction of 513,250,000 pounds of wastewater from washers, and 50,760 pounds from tumblers.
This equates to a 95 percent reduction of these waste streams.
Reusing rinse waters would provide an estimated annual waste reduction of 284,856,000 pounds (or 53 percent) of wastewater from the washers.
Installing a screen over the Dumpster and plastic shrouds in the tumblers to collect pumice and lint would reduce each of these waste streams by 40 percent annually.
Costs The following table summarizes the estimated costs of implementing each opportunity presented by the waste reduction program: Pollution Prevention Opportunity On-site wastewater treatment plant Reuse of rinse waters Installation of screens Installation of plastic shrouds Metering of wastewater Implementation Costs ($) 1,570,000 23,260 3,300 3,000 5,140 file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Annual Savings Page 32 of 65 The following table summarizes the estimated annual savings derived from implementing each opportunity presented by the waste reduction program: Pollution Prevention Opportunities On-site wastewater treatment plant Reuse of rinse waters Installation of screens Installation of plastic shrouds Metering of wastewater Annual Savings ($) 350,000 95,480 23,690 18,690 7,125 In most cases, the economic savings of the minimization opportunities result from the reduced need for raw material and from reduced present and future costs associated with hazardous waste treatment and disposal.
Other savings, which this study could not quantify, include a wide variety of possible future costs related to changing emissions standards, liability, and employee health.
Also, the savings given for each opportunity reflect the savings achievable when implementing each waste minimization opportunity independently and do not reflect duplication of savings that may result when the opportunities are implemented in a package.
file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 33 of 65 CASE STUDY NO. 13--Preparation, Printing, and Finishing Industry: Preparation, Printing, and Finishing Plant (SIC 2291) Pollution Prevention Application: Reuse, Chemical Substitution, Equipment Upgrade Background The company under study employs 230 people.
It is engaged in the preparation, continuous rotary screen printing, and finishing of textile.
The company mainly supplies its product to the home fashions industry.
Waste Reduction Activities Ã¯Â¿Â½ Eliminate concentrated pigment discharge from printing operations to the sewer through a "waste workoff" color matching system.
The company's printing facility applies aqueous-based pigment emulsions onto its prepared fabric with five rotary screen print machines.
The print machines can produce patterns with up to 24 different colors and yield about 6 million yards of printed fabric monthly.
During a run of an individual print pattern through the machine, an employee--known as a "printer"--requests that the color shop prepare additional pigment.
The printer bases the need for more color on the machine's consumption of each color per yard of fabric previously run (liters of pigment per yard of fabric).
About 150 drums of pigment concentrate is used per day, with five drums of waste pigment concentrate sent to the sewer daily.
Excess pigment remaining at the end of a pattern's run was originally washed to the sewer in a barrel washer.
With the aid of the State of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) Pollution Prevention Program, the company purchased a spectrophotometer, equipped with a personal computer, and "Waste Work-Off" software to reduce this waste stream at the source.
Operators now run waste pigment samples through the spectrophotometer, which yields shade change formulas for matching the pigments to other patterns not yet printed.
This has resulted in the reuse of all five barrels of waste color produced daily.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use ultrafiltration (UF) to remove aqueous-based pigments and reuse 300,000 gallons of rinse water daily.
Rinse waters totaling 300,000 gallons per day are generated by (1) the conveyor sprays of five print machines, (2) three barrel washers, and (3) miscellaneous equipment rinsing with high-pressure hoses.
Pigments used in the print operation are rinsed off the equipment, and the resulting colored water flows into two collection sumps.
Previously, the two sumps gravity-discharged into the sewer.
The company contacted DEM's Pollution Prevention Program to explore water conservation and recycling techniques.
Upon completion of several pilot studies, the company purchased and installed a 450000-gallon-per-day UF system to remove the suspended pigment solids from its rinse water and to reuse the permeate water at the machines.
The Membrex UF system is fitted with 50000-molecular-weight cutoff membranes.
The pigment solids and debris that the membranes reject and concentrate are flocculated and filter-pressed for nonhazardous disposal.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Eliminate the use of naphtha solvent through chemical substitution with an alkaline aqueous-based cleaner.
The company was interested in finding a suitable nonhazardous replacement for its naphtha solvent.
The company contacted DEM's Pollution Prevention Program for vendor and product information.
Several aqueous cleaners were tested for com (galvanized rubber) and the metallic screens switched from using RI Screen Cleaner (100 cleaner.
Spent d-limonene cleaner is sent to patibility with the company's print machine conveyor belts used to apply pigment onto fabric.
In 1993, the company percent naphtha) to using Diversey's Jettacin (d-limonene) the company's UF system, where the permeate is used for file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 34 of 65 rinses in the screen printing operation.
(UF costs are not included in this payback analysis, because the UF system is part of a much larger project, and the flow from the spent d-limonene cleaner is considered insignificant.)
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use countercurrent rinsing to conserve water used in textile preparation.
The company's textile preparation facility produces peroxide-bleached, washed, and dried fabric for subsequent printing and finishing at its sister facilities.
The facility employs about 80 people.
Management contacted DEM's Pollution Prevention Program for assistance in determining water conservation techniques that the facility could implement.
The average daily water use at the preparation plant exceeded 250,000 gallons per day.
The Pollution Prevention staff recommended countercurrent rinsing methods for the open-width and rope washers at the facility.
The company tested its product's quality on a pilot scale with countercurrent rinsing, and determined that the fabric's quality was not affected.
Peroxide-bleached fabric is fed through two rope washers while city water flows opposite the fabric.
The discharge water from the second rope washer is pumped into the first, yielding countercurrent rinsing.
Fresh water consumption in this process has decreased by 10,000 gallons per day.
The open-width washer consists of seven basins, three of which contain a solution of soap and water.
The last four basins contain only rinse water.
Fabric is fed into the first of the three soap basins, and fresh water is fed into the last of the three basins.
The water from the second and third basins flows over into the first basin.
The first basin--which contains soap, water, and fabric contaminants--overflows to the sewer.
The fabric is then fed from the third basin into the first of four rinse basins.
Fresh water is fed into the last of the four basins, overflowing to the first basin and then to the sewer.
Fresh water consumption in this process has decreased by 25,000 gallons per day.
Waste Reduction Results By implementing the color reuse program (waste work-off software), the company has discharge of pigment concentrate to the local sewer.
The company has found spectrophotometer technology, it can reformulate leftover pigments to match the colors This reshading procedure has not only eliminated the concentrated pigment discharge and it, but it has also reduced the pigment feedstock requirements by five drums per day.
eliminated a five-drum-per-day that, by using computer and needed in upcoming patterns.
the rinse waters associated with The company has invested the capital to recycle its rinse water.
Although no immediate payback will be seen, the company is confident that operating costs for the UF system will be absorbed by the significant savings in water and sewer costs, and the avoided costs of POTW surcharges and fines.
The elimination of a colored waste stream of this magnitude has helped the local POTW with excess influent problems.
The elimination of naphtha-based cleaner (two drums per year) has reduced the company's environmental liability and increased worker safety.
The company has realized that, by replacing the hazardous solvent naphtha with an aqueous cleaner, it was also able to reduce cleaning costs by over 75 percent.
The company is saving over $20,000 per year by implementing countercurrent rinsing techniques.
The company has reduced its demand from the city water works by nearly 9 million gallons per year and has reduced its impact on the local sewer system by the same amount.

Installation of the Membrex UF system, to enable the company to recycle rinse water, has saved an estimated $225,000 annually in water and sewer charges.
Jettacin d-limonene cleaner (used at the required concentration) costs $1.81 per gallon, and the naphtha screen cleaner costs $15.00 per gallon.
Feedstock levels have remained the same; therefore, the company is saving $13.18 per gallon with the aqueous cleaner.
Implementation of countercurrent rinsing provides the company with annual savings of $21,875.

Man-Made Fiber: A class name for various genera of fibers (including filaments) produced from fiber-forming substances, including (1) polymers synthesized from chemical compounds, such as acrylic, nylon, polyurethane, and polyvinyl fibers; (2) modified or transformed natural polymers, such as acetates and rayons; or (3) mineral, such as glass; the term "man-made" is usually used to designate all chemically produced fibers to distinguish them from the truly natural fibers, such as cotton, wool, silk, and flax Mercerization: A treatment for cotton yarn or fabric to increase its luster and affinity for dyes; the material is immersed under tension in a cold sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) solution in warp, skein form, or in the piece, and is later neutralized in acid; the process causes a permanent swelling of the fiber and, therefore, increases its luster Metallized Dye: Two acid dyes (anionic, water-soluble) joined together to make a larger molecule that has greater light and wet fastness; it is used mainly for dyeing nylon and wool where high fastness is required GLOSSARY Naphthol Dye: An azo dye whose color is formed by coupling with naphthol; used chiefly on cotton Napping: A finishing process that raises the surface fibers of a fabric by means of passing them over rapidly revolving cylinders that are covered with metal points or teasel burrs; outing, flannel, and wool broadcloth derive their down appearance from this finishing process; napping is also used for certain knit goods, blankets, and other fabrics having raised surfaces Narrow Fabric: Any nonelastic woven fabric, 12 inches wide or less, having a selvage on either side, except for ribbon or seam binding Natural Fiber: A class name for the various genera of fibers (including filaments) of animal, mineral, or vegetable origin; examples include (1) silk and wool, (2) asbestos, and (3) cotton, flax, jute, and ramie Nonwoven: A material that is made of fibers in a web or mat, with the fibers generally held together by a bonding agent Nylon: Generic name for a manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polyamide having recurring amide groups as an integral part of the polymer chain file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 40 of 65 Opening: (1) A preliminary operation, in the processing of staple fiber, that removes the heavier impurities; and (2) an operation, in the processing of tow, that substantially increases the bulk of the tow by separating the filaments and deregistering the crimp
Package Dyeing: The dyeing of yarns in the form of a package of various kinds and sizes; packages wound onto perforated tubes or springs are placed on perforated spindles in a closed vat, and the dye bath is circulated in and out of the package
Padding: Application of a liquor or paste to textiles either by passing the material through a bath and, subsequently, through squeeze rollers, or by passing it between squeeze rollers, the bottom one of which carries the liquor or paste (a pad or padder) Paddle Dyeing Machine: A machine that is used for dyeing garments, hosiery, and other small pieces that are packaged loosely in mesh bags; the unit consists of an open tank and revolving paddles that circulate the bags in the dyebath Permanent Finish: Fabric treatments, of various kinds, designed to improve glaze, hand, or performance of fabrics; these finishes are durable during laundering PET (Polyethylene terephthalate): Polyester Picking: (1) A process that continues the opening and cleaning of staple and forms a continuous fiber sheet (or lap), which is delivered to the card; and (2) the operation of passing the filling through the warp shed during weaving GLOSSARY Pile: (1) A fabric effect that is formed by introducing tufts, loops, or other erect yarns on all or part of the fabric surface; types of pile are warp, filling, and knotted pile, or loops that are produced by weaving an extra set of yarns over wires that are then drawn out of the fabric.
Plain wires leave uncut loops: wires with a razor-like blade produce a cut pile surface.
Pile fabric may also be made by producing a double-cloth structure woven face to face, with an extra set of yarn being interlaced with each cloth alternately.
The two fabrics are cut apart by a traversing knife, thereby producing two fabrics with a cut pile surface.
Pile should not be confused with nap.
Corduroys are another type of pile fabric, where long filling floats on the surface are slit, causing the pile to stand erect.
(2) In carpets, pile refers to the face yarn, as opposed to the backing or support yarn.
Pile carpets are produced by either tufting or weaving.
Plying: Twisting together two or more single yarns or ply yarns to form, respectively, ply yarn or cord Polyester: A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer that is composed of at least 85 percent by weight of an ester of dihydric alcohol and terephthalic acid Printing: A process for producing a pattern on yarns, warp, fabric, or carpet by any of numerous printing methods; the color or other treating material, usually in the form of a paste, is deposited onto the fabric, which is then usually treated with steam, heat, or chemicals for fixation Print Paste: The mixture of gum or thickener, dye, and appropriate chemicals used in printing fabrics; viscosity varies with the types of printing equipment, the type of cloth, the degree of penetration desired, and other factors PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol): Synthetic size that is used in the sizing process in manufacturing cotton fabric Raw Fiber: A textile fiber in its natural state, such as silk "in the gum" and cotton as it comes from the bale Rayon: A generic name for man-made fibers, monofilaments, and continuous filaments, that are made from regenerated cellulose; fibers produced by both viscose and cupra-ammonium processes are classified as rayon Reactive Dyes: Dyes that react chemically with the fiber Reed: A narrow, movable frame that is fitted with wooden or metal strips that separate the warp threads Resin: A chemical finish that is used to impart a property desired in a fabric, such as water repellency file://O:\Lars\Beth's%20Proj\19041.htm 8/29/2002 POLLUTION PREVENTION Page 41 of 65 Retardants: Chemicals that are typically applied to fabrics or fibers to retard burning or other unwanted conditions Rheology: Study of the deformation and flow characteristics of printing pastes GLOSSARY Rope Soaper: A piece of equipment that is used for scouring fabric to remove impurities, such as processing oils and excess dye Roving: (1) In spun yarn production, an intermediate state between the sliver and the yarn; roving is a condensed sliver that has been drafted, twisted, doubled, and redoubled.
The product of the first roving operation is sometimes called slubbing; (2) the operation that produces roving (see [1]) Saturator: A box that is used to impregnate fabric with chemicals in a continuous range Scouring: Removal of foreign components from textiles; normal scouring materials are alkalis (such as soda ash) or trisodium phosphate, frequently used in the presence of a surfactant; textile materials are sometimes scoured by using a solvent Selvage: The narrow edge of the woven fabric that runs parallel to the warp; to prevent it from raveling, the manufacturer makes it with stronger yarns in a tighter construction than the body of the fabric; a fast selvage encloses all or part of the picks, and a selvage is not fast when the filling threads are cut at the fabric edge after every pick Shuttle: A boat-shaped device, usually made of wood with a metal tip, that carries the filling yarns through the shed in the weaving process; it is the most common weft-insertion device.
The shuttle holds a quill, on which the filling yarn is wound Singeing: Passing the cloth across an open gas flame at a high speed to burn off the loose surface fibers Sizing: Applying starch, PVA, or CMC to warp
