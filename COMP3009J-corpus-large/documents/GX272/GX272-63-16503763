INTRODUCTION
AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION
A
mericans list the environment as one of our prime concerns.
The problems our generation faces are becoming more alarming every day.
Although "endangered animals" is only one topic related to the environment, wildlife is considered by some an "environmental barometer".
("Wildlife, The Environmental Barometer" Â­ brochure, Wildlife Management Institute, Washington, D.C.)
Wildlife exists where nature is balanced.
Some scientists estimate the current extinction rate is more than 1,000 times the natural rate of extinction.
("Windows on the Wild" Â­ World Wildlife Fund 1999) Although extinction itself is a natural phenomenon, it is today's accelerated rate which is not natural.
Humans are altering the environment to such a degree that many animals cannot adapt Â­ therefore they die.
Other species are being illegally hunted or trapped at a rate that is also causing extinction.
Oil spills, pesticides, acid rain, and solid wastes are f inding their way into animals' digestive tracts and skin, which is still another reason animals are disappearing from our earth.
If, in fact, wildlife is an "environmental barometer", the human species is also in trouble.
When a species is extinct, that means it no longer exists anywhere on the ear th; it is gone forever.
Endangered animals are in danger of becoming extinct.
Threatened animals are animals that will probably become endangered unless something is done to help them.
The federal government passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973.
This law protects listed endangered and threatened species from being hunted, collected, sold, or used in any way without a permit.
States set land aside solely for wildlife.
Zoos study endangered animals and attempt to breed them in captivity.
"Foster parenting" is another method used with some species to increase their numbers (for example, the whooping crane).
You don't have to be a scientist or a governor to help in the f ight against extinction.
You can help to enforce wildlife laws.
You can avoid buying products that are made from endangered animals (it's illegal in this country).
You can write letters to your congressmen.
You can support wildlife organizations.
Most of all, you can learn about endangered animals and teach others.
Educators can adapt the lessons and ideas to meet their own class needs, as I did for our second grade.
Enjoy!

UNIT GOALS The goals of this unit are as follows: 1.
Students will develop empathy, concern, and awareness of and about endangered animals.
2.
Students will understand the major factors that cause animals to become rare, threatened, endangered, and extinct (habitat destruction, over specialization, pollution, and poaching).
3.
Students will gain an understanding of what is presently being done to save endangered animals.
4.
Students will explore their own ideas of what needs to be done, as well as what individuals and groups can do, to help save endangered animals.

6
Lesson 1 Â­ Brainstorming Prior Knowledge Objective: Find out what students know about endangered animals.
Method: Brainstorm prior knowledge Material: Chalkboard or large piece of paper to record what students say.
Procedure: Write "Endangered Animals" on the top of the paper or on the chalkboard.
Ask students what they know about endangered animals.
Record all responses, correct and incor rect.
Note: Save this for the end of the unit; cross out incor rect responses at this time, and add other facts that were learned during the unit.
Lesson 2 Â­ Apple Demonstration Objective: At the end of this lesson, students will have a better understanding of how small an area of the earth humans and all other land dwelling animals live.
Method: Demonstration Materials: A whole apple, a knife, and a cutting board, globe for comparison Procedure: Have the atmosphere.
Tell them the apple is similar to they think people and students sit so they can see the demonstration.
Create a "serious" that we are going to pretend that this apple is the earth.
Discuss how the earth.
Ask the students to guess how much of the earth (apple) animals that live on the land occupy.
Â· 70-75% of earth is covered with oceans; cut the apple in fourths and push 3 quarters to the side.
Â· 30% of what remains is too dry for life to exist; cut 1/3 away and push to the side.
Â· 30% of what remains is too mountainous for life to exist; cut another 1/3 away and push to the side.
Â· Of the remaining portion, only the surface (skin) is used for living space; trim off the skin.
Â· Ask the students "How long until we use it up?" Don't wait for a response; eat skin.
Have students write for f ive minutes to express their feelings, thoughts, and ideas to "save the earth".
Students who wish can then share their responses.
7
Lesson 3 Â­ Animal Interviews Objective: Students will become aware of reasons why some animals are endangered.
Each student will examine an endangered animal by researching, writing, and verbally describing the problems of a particular animal.
Students will design their own costumes and props for interviews.
Method: Research, write reports, interviews with classmates Materials: Resource folders containing information about an animal, its habitat, its status (endangered, threatened, rare), its problems/reasons for being endangered, etc. (one folder per two children).
Teacher makes these in advance.
Materials for props and costumes.
Procedure: Teacher models an interview (s/he dresses up or makes a puppet); introduce yourself and ask students to write down a question to ask this animal.
Tell the students some facts about yourself (the animal): where you live, what you eat, your life cycle, etc. then allow the students to inter view you.
Students research animals in pairs; when a pair is ready, let their classmates interview them.
A "data sheet" listing the type of information they are expected to know might be helpful.
Note: Model an interview at the beginning of the unit.
Allow the students ample time to research their animal, and then make the interviews the culminating project for the unit.
In the following lessons, when I refer to "an animal", students can work with their partners, and use "their animals" as the focus of the lessons.
Lesson 4 Â­ Habitat and Its Components Objective: Students will be able to def ine "habitat" and identify its components.
Students will brainstorm, then organize and synthesize the information.
Method: Brainstorm.
Draw and label parts of own habitat, then of an animal's habitat Materials: Chalkboard, drawing paper, crayons.
Procedure: On the board make two columns with headings "people" and "wildlife".
Ask the students what people need in order to survive; write down all responses.
Do the same for wildlife heading.
Go back over the lists to tr y to nar row each one of them down to water, food, shelter, space, ar rangement, sunlight, air, and soil.
Â· Define habitat: home for animals, what they need in order to survive.
Â· Add "pets" and "plants".
Do these have the same components? Â· Have students draw pictures of their own habitats (homes) and label water, food, shelter, space, and arrangement.
Share the pictures, then have students draw pictures of an animal's habitat and label the par ts.
Note: If students have a hard time with ar rangement, ask them how convenient it would be if their bathroom were two miles from their house!
8
Lesson 5 Â­ From the Wild to Captivity Objective: Students will be able to identify and analyze problems that occur when animals are moved from the wild to captivity.
Students design zoo environments for endangered animals that satisfy all the needs for that particular animal.
Method: Discussion, drawings Materials: Drawing paper, crayons Procedure: Review the def inition of "habitat".
List components on board (water, food, space, protection, ar rangement).
Â· Discuss different types of habitat in relation to different animals.
Â· Choose one type of animal, and list habitat requirements for that animal.
Â· Draw a picture of that animal in a zoo with all its needs satisf ied.
Label the needs of the animal.
Is it possible? Discuss pictures.
Discuss the problems scientists and zookeepers have when they want to keep a wild animal in an enclosed area.
Read: Close to the Wild by Thomas Cajacob and Theresa Burton (See "Children's Literature" list for details)
Lesson 6 Â­ Human Alterations in the Environment Objective: Students will be able to describe some ways that humans are altering habitats, which causes some animals to become endangered.
Method: Worksheet; discussion Materials: Worksheet (NatureScope "Endangered Species: Wild 
Â· Show pictures of endangered animals.
Â· Explain that the main reason species are disappearing is because humans are changing their habitats.
Ask the students why people would want to change habitats.
Â· Do worksheet together with discussion.
The large pictures in the middle represent the way people are changing habitats.
The smaller pictures on the top and bottom show why people change habitats.
Â· Draw lines from the big pictures to the small pictures to show the reasons why people are changing habitats.
Â· Discuss other ways that people are changing habitats, and why.
Discuss the consequences this might have for wildlife.
Â· Let students color the page.

10
Lesson 7 Â­ Acid Rain: An Experiment Objective: Students will formulate hypotheses, perform an experiment, and evaluate the results.
Students will be able to draw conclusions about the way acid rain affects plant and animal life.
Method: Experiment with plants and vinegar Materials: Four bean plants (plant two ahead of time), two peperomia plants, two jade plants, vinegar, water, plastic bag, paper towels, two spray bottles, r uler.
Procedure: While students are out of the room, wet 4 or 5 paper towels with vinegar and place them around the room.
When students enter the room and notice the smell, discuss how people get rid of smells (place smelly paper towels in a plastic bag and throw away).
Animals don't have the ability to get away from some types of pollution.
Â· Does anyone know what acid rain is? Discuss.
Â· Draw a simple picture of smokestacks, pollution f illed clouds moving away, and then falling as rain in a pond with f ish, f ish die or are eaten by a bird, etc.
Â· Bring out plants and spray bottles.
Explain to the students that acid rain sometimes is as acidic as vinegar.
Label one bottle "acid rain" (vinegar) and the other water.
Have one student spray half the plants with water, and another student spray the other plants with acid rain.
Label the plants.
Determine how much liquid should be sprayed on the plants (for example, ten pumps).
For mulate a hypotheses about acid rain and how it might affect the plants.
Fill out charts.
Charts should include a date, color, height, width, and comments for each plant.
Optional: Start two other plants as seedlings.
What effect does acid rain have on these plants? Continue this for several days (two weeks is a good length of time).
Discuss how acid rain could affect animals by getting in the food chain.
For backg round, read: "Acid rain: Effects on f ish and wildlife", US depar tment of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife service, Leaflet 1, Washington, D.C., 1985; "The Acid Rain Story", Friends of the Earth / EPI / OS, Washington, D.C., 1985.
11
Lesson 8 Â­ Carrying Capacity and Crowding Objective: Students will be able to def ine "car rying capacity".
Students will become more sympathetic toward animals whose habitat is being destroyed.
Method: Students experience crowding; discussion Procedure: Ask for a student volunteer.
Â· Approach the student, asking when the closeness feels uncomfortable.
Â· Discuss types of physical and emotional reactions.
Does one feel the same with family or close friends? Animals also feel uncomfor table when approached; discuss reasons why (fear of predation, protect young).
Â· Discuss why are some animals more comfortable around humans than others (fly, quick, swim, size, alone or in group).
Â· Now have students all sit very close together; how do they feel? What would happen if animals were crowded? Would they survive? What do they need to survive? What might an animal do if it were crowded? (Leave, attack, disease, die, not enough food) What kinds of human intervention could occur which would help wildlife? (Reintroduce predators, winter-feeding, plant additional vegetation, relocate animals, hunting) Â· Def ine "carrying capacity" Â­ The number of plants and animals that an environment can support.
Why is this important? What is the car rying capacity for the classroom?
Lesson 9 Â­ Plastic Food Objective: Students will be able to describe the potential harmful effects of plastic and garbage on wildlife.
Students will formulate and identify possible solutions to the problems that exist with waste.
Method: Student examines waste and learns about its effects on wildlife Procedure: Teacher collects garbage for a couple of days (the students could collect it).
Examine each article.
Discuss how it could be perceived as food.
Try to identify some animals that might perceive it as food.
How might these materials affect animals if ingested or otherwise be harmful? Show pictures of garbage and animal interactions.
What are some possible solutions to these problems? Homework: Tell students to list 30 plastic items found in their home.
The next day, share lists.
Make a classroom list.
For Background, read: "Oceans at Risk", Animals, Jan/Feb 1989, p. 7-23.
12
Lesson 10 Â­ Chopping Down the Forest Objective: Students will be able to describe some ways that wildlife is affected by deforestation.
Method: Brainstorming; students create a "human forest"; discussion Materials: Fan; chalkboard or large piece of paper Procedure: Draw a picture of a forest on the board.
Â· Tell the students that a road is going to be put through the middle of this forest.
Erase a strip through the forest.
Ask the students how this might affect the wildlife.
Discuss and list all responses.
Â· Have the students stand very close together in a big group with their arms up (human forest).
Ask the child in the center to describe what he or she sees when "looking through the trees".
(How much light is on the floor? See me? See the rest of the room?) Â· Turn on a fan at the edge of the human forest.
Can the center student feel the breeze? Hear the fan? Â· Begin to "chop down" the forest by removing the kids near the edge.
Have the center child report any changes.
Continue to chop down the forest until the center child is at the edge of the forest (you might f ind your "forest" moves!).
Ask students what happened to the area that used to be the center of the forest (now it's the edge).
How might this affect wildlife that used to live in the center? Â· Discuss and add to list.
Read: Read Roadside by David Bellamy.
(See "Children's Literature" list for details.)
13
Lesson 11 Â­ Oil Pollution: An Experiment Objective: Students will formulate hypotheses, perform an experiment, and evaluate the results.
Students will also be able to draw conclusions about the way an oil spill can cause species to become endangered.
Method: Experiment with oil and eggs Materials: Oil, water, 4 hard-boiled eggs, blue food coloring, eye dropper, 2 cup bowl, measuring cup Procedure: Ask the students if they heard about the Exxon Oil spill in Prince William sound, Alaska.
Discuss it and its effects on wildlife and people.
Note how far away we are from Alaska.
We can have our own spill in the classroom! Â· Peel, and then pass between the students, a regular hard-boiled egg (control egg) .
Â· Mix Â½ cup oil, 10 drops of blue food coloring, and Â½ cup water in bowl.
Place remaining 3 eggs in the bowl.
While waiting, formulate hypotheses about what affects the oil will have on the eggs.
Â· Remove the f irst egg after 5 minutes, the second egg after 15 minutes, and the third egg after 30 minutes.
Try to dry off the egg before peeling it.
Â· Observe, record and discuss the results.
Â· Discuss other effects oil spills have, such as: Harms unhatched eggs.
Gets into pores of skin then into the blood stream, gets into the food chain and is digested.
Gets into fur and feathers therefore they lose their ability to keep the animal warm, etc.
Note: Students do this experiment in four g roups of f ive.
Each student does an observation sheet (next pages).
Read: Ranger Rick, "The Big Oil Spill", Januar y 1990, p.32-34.
The Comeback Trail, "The Deadly Effects of Crude Oil", spring, 1989, p.1, 4 (Newsletter put out by DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE Â­ see bibliography).

Lesson 12 Â­ More Than One Reason Objective: Students will understand that many reasons, not just one, cause animals to become extinct.
Method: Students will make paper plate wheels which show the various reasons why an animal is endangered Materials: Paper plates, paper fasteners, scissors, crayons or markers.
Procedure: Pass out two paper plates to each student.
Â· Discuss reasons why animals are endangered (pollution, habitat loss, illegal hunting or trapping, nets, etc.).
Â· Depending on the animal and its problems, divide one plate with a ruler, drawing lines (for example, turtles have at least four problems Â­ pollution, caught in nets, illegally killed for products and habitat destruction Â­ so divide the plate into fourths).
Â· Label and draw the problems in each section.
Â· Cut a triangle out of the other plate, the size of one of the sections DO NOT cut it all the way to the center.
Â· Fasten the plate with the cut triangle on top of the plate with the sections.
Â· Draw a picture of the endangered animal on the top plate; title your wheel.
Â· Share wheels.
Lesson 13 Â­ Susceptibility to Extinction Objective: Students will be able to recognize the traits that make an animal susceptible to extinction.
Method: Students evaluate traits of imaginary animals, then design their own animals Materials: Teacher-made up imaginar y animals (2-4) with various traits (or see Nature Scope, Endangered species: Wild 
Procedure: Discuss imaginary animals that you have made up.
Decide which out of these is most likely to go extinct f irst and why.
Students now make up their own imaginary animals and list their traits.
Animals should either be "endangered" or never go extinct.
Share pictures and discuss traits.
Note: Traits of imaginary animals should be things like: eats food that only grows on one tropical island, lays one egg every four years, is very slow, not afraid of anything, have ver y valuable feathers, etc.

Lesson 14 Â­ Bumper Stickers and Buttons: Make a Statement Objective: Students will identify button and bumper stickers designed to make a statement about some issues.
Method: Students make bumper stickers and/or buttons Materials: Bumper stickers Â­ white contact paper or oak tag, which can be laminated when completed, tape for the backs, markers.
Buttons Â­ button machine or 3" circles on white oak tag, markers, safety pins.
Bumper stickers and buttons for demonstration of examples.
Procedure: Show examples to kids.
Discuss various slogans and their pur pose.
Â· Brainstorm issues to use to make slogans.
Â· Help kids design their own sticker or button.
Â· Laminate or tape.
Â· Use safety pins to attach buttons.
Â· Share slogans and designs.
Lesson 15 Â­ Harmful Activities and Alternatives Objective: Students will evaluate a number of activities that are harmful to wildlife, and recommend alternatives.
Method: Brainstor ming and drawings used for discussion Materials: Cards which show humans in various activities, some that harm wildlife and others that help it.
Chalkboard or pieces of paper, drawing paper, and crayons.
Procedure: Brainstorm a list of activities they have seen or heard that are harmful.
Divide the class into groups of 4 or 5.
Start by demonstrating what to do with the cards with the whole class.
Hold up a card, discuss what it shows and decide why it is har mful or why it is not harmful and if it is, what can be done to make the activity benef icial to wildlife.
Give each group some cards which they must separate into two groups: harmful and not harmful.
Students should then discuss alternative activities for the harmful pile.
Bring the class back together.
Have a spokesperson from each group share their results with the rest of the class.
Pass out drawing paper, and have students make their own cards.
On the back have them write the helpful alternative activity.
