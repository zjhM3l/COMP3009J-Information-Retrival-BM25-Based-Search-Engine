TSBP is self-supporting, in that the operations of the agency are supported primarily from statutory fees related to licensing, reciprocity, and examinations.
The general operating fund of the Board is a general revenue dedicated account within the State Treasury (Texas Pharmacy Act, Section 554.007).
The policymaking body is a nine-member Board, with six members who are pharmacists and three members who represent the public.
At the time of their appointments, the pharmacist-members must have been licensed as a pharmacist for the five years preceding appointment, be in good standing with the Board, and be practicing pharmacy in this state.
In addition, the Board must include representation from pharmacists who are primarily employed in community and institutional pharmacies.
The Board has the responsibility of regulating three distinct entities Â­ the persons who dispense prescription drugs to the public (pharmacists) and who assist the pharmacist (pharmacy technicians); the place where prescription drugs are dispensed to the public (pharmacies); and the distribution of dangerous drugs (prescription drugs that are not classified as controlled substances).
The Board has the sole responsibility for the administration and the enforcement of the Texas Pharmacy Act and Texas Dangerous Drug Act.

What type of training do the agency's policymaking body members receive?
New Board Members attend an intensive two-day orientation session conducted by the Executive Director and applicable agency staff.
The Executive Director provides an overview of the Board organization, information regarding issues facing the Board, and statutory responsibilities of the Board and its members.
Division Directors review agency programs and operations, including state accounting procedures, insurance, and instructions on preparation of travel vouchers.
The agency's General Counsel reviews the following items with new Board Members: specific laws, rules and policies that affect Board Members, such as the Texas Open Meetings Act, Texas Public Information Act, Texas Administrative Procedures Act, and laws relating to Ethics and ethical conduct.
See Attachment #C. New Board Members do not vote on issues before the Board until they have completed this initial orientation session.
New Board Members also attend an orientation program conducted by the Governor's office.
All Board Members attend conferences and meetings held by major pharmacy organizations to learn of issues facing the profession.
Members are regularly notified of and encouraged to attend various programs presented by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), the LBJ School of Public Affairs, and other organizations that periodically sponsor seminars or conferences relevant to service on the Board.
The OAG generally offers an annual training session which informs members of their responsibilities under various state statutes such as the Texas Open Meetings Act, Texas Public Information Act, and ethics laws.
Ongoing training sessions also occur at Board Meetings; see examples below: (1) in FY2000, the Board participated in one training session regarding strategic planning that was conducted by a representative of the Governor's office, as well as two strategic planning workshops; in FY2001, the Board received a four-hour lecture on drug and alcohol dependency and peer assistance issues presented by a professor of a Texas College of Pharmacy; and in FY2003, the Board listened to a presentation on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and federal rules promulgated pursuant to that Act relating to privacy issues and confidentiality of protected health information.

TSBP obtains input regarding issues under the jurisdiction of the agency through a myriad of sources, including the following: (1) Task Forces Â­ The Board President appoints task forces to study issues and make recommendations to the Board (i.e., pre-rulemaking activity).
The task forces provide an excellent mechanism to gather expertise and "grass-roots" advice from practicing pharmacists and other interested stakeholders on matters affecting the practice of pharmacy.
If the task force is assisting the Board to develop rules to implement a new law passed by the Texas Legislature, TSBP invites the bill sponsor(s) to send representative(s) to the task force meetings.
The three major professional organizations in Texas (Texas Pharmacy Association, Texas Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and Texas Federation of Chain Drug Stores) are also requested to nominate persons from each organization to serve on task forces.
Examples of task forces appointed in the past five years are listed below: (A) FY1999 Â­ Task Force on Pharmacists' Working Conditions and Their Impact on Public Health; and Task Force on Non-Resident Pharmacies and Automation in Pharmacies;

The preparation of each year's annual operating budget, as well as the Agency's Legislative Appropriation Request, occurs after the following reviews are conducted: (1) The Executive Director presents a review to the Board, of the current year's progress towards objectives to determine not only the progress towards the Agency's goals and objectives, but any workload and/or fiscal restraints that have an impact on the accomplishment of those objectives.
The Board reviews the Agency's Strategic Plan to determine not only financial impact, but workload and human resource impact.
This review also serves the purpose of "linking" the Strategic Plan to the Annual Goals and Objectives and the budgeting process.
(2)
Following these reviews, a financial budget is prepared, which is necessary to accomplish the adopted goals.
In addition, a fee structure required to support the budget is determined.
In this preparation, the Director of Administrative Services performs the following process: (1) (2) (3) reviews past budgetary expenditure trends to determine historical patterns of spending; reviews any new legislation that may have an impact on financial affairs, (e.g., increase in mileage, across-the-board budget cuts, transfers to other state agencies); consults with the Executive Director and Division Directors to determine needs in each program area, considering increases to workload as well as new programs/initiatives that may affect the budgetary process; and reviews available data regarding key performance measures that may have an impact on revenues produced, (e.g., projected number of licensees, projected number of examinations, estimated sale of surplus property).

Does the agency have an equal employment opportunity policy? How does the agency address performance shortfalls related to the policy?
The agency Personnel Manual and Employee Handbook contains a Recruitment Plan/Affirmative Action Plan.
This plan is designed to assure the implementation of human resource policies and practices to promote equal employment opportunities.
TSBP recognizes that full and equal participation of minorities, women and disabled persons in all employment opportunities is a necessary component of an effective Recruitment Plan/Affirmative Action Plan.
TSBP's plan is designed to conform in good faith with the Affirmative Action Guidelines adopted by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and developed with the assistance of the Texas Commission on Human Rights.
The plan is available for review by TSBP employees, applicants for employment, and the general public upon request.
The Plan is also available on the TSBP Internet Web site: www.tsbp.state.tx.us.
To address any potential performance shortfalls, the TSBP has adopted an internal grievance procedure for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any adverse action that results from discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or disability.
In addition, an employee may also seek an administrative remedy through federal agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, or state agencies such as the Texas Commission on Human Rights.

When and for what purpose was the program or function created? Describe any statutory or other requirements for this program or function.
Legislation that first recognized the need for regulation of the practice of pharmacy in Texas was passed in 1889.
That year the legislature established boards of "pharmaceutical examiners," which were three-man committees in each senatorial district of the state.
Pharmacists were tested and certified by these committees, although there was much inconsistency as to standards.
Few records were kept, and there was no central authority to coordinate the committees' activities.
To bring consistency and centralization to pharmacy practice regulation, the legislature passed the first Texas Pharmacy Act in 1907.
This Act established the Texas State Board of Pharmacy as an independent state regulatory board.

Describe any important history not included in the general agency history section, including a discussion of how the services or functions have changed from the original intent.
Will there be a time when the mission will be accomplished and the program or function will no longer be needed?
Over the years, the services/functions of the Licensing Program have expanded, but the original intent of the Licensing Program has remained the same: to license only competent and qualified applicants to practice and operate a pharmacy, and more recently, to register qualified pharmacy technicians to assist pharmacists with non-judgmental duties relating to the dispensing of prescriptions.
The "Texas Time Line" (in Section II), notes the major changes to the Texas Pharmacy Act with regard to the Licensure Program.
However, specific "important history" regarding the Licensure Program is set forth below: Prior to 1981 1981
one type of pharmacist and pharmacy license; annual renewal.
Â· Â· one type of pharmacist license; four types of pharmacy licenses; licensing of institutional pharmacies and clinic pharmacies began; and TSBP promulgated rules increasing the number of internship hours required for licensure to 1,500 hours.
1984
TSBP promulgated rules that: Â· Â· provided for the staggered renewal of pharmacist licenses (annual renewals); and prohibited a pharmacist from serving as a preceptor if the pharmacist had been the subject of disciplinary sanctions within the previous three years.
1987
TSBP promulgated rules that: Â· Â· allowed Class D Pharmacies to petition the Board to have expanded formularies of dangerous drugs, under certain conditions; and allowed persons who had graduated from a foreign pharmacy school to apply for pharmacist license in Texas under certain conditions.
1988 1989
Staggered annual renewal of pharmacy licenses began.
Mandatory continuing education for pharmacists (12 hours per year) began.
-36-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
1991
Texas Legislature passed laws that: Â· Â· created a fifth type of pharmacy license (Class E); created a system whereby a pharmacist was allowed to place their license on Inactive Status if the pharmacist complied with all the licensing requirements for the renewal of the license other than completing the continuing education requirements (applicable rules were implemented in May 1993); prohibited agencies from renewing or issuing a license to any person who was in default on his/her student loan; and gave the Texas Attorney General the authority to issue an order to a state licensing agency to suspend any license of a person who was in arrears on child support payments.
Â· Â·
1997
TSBP implemented new procedures relating to the Licensing Program: Â· Â· computerized adaptive testing of NAPLEX began for initial licensing of pharmacists; and an expanded student pharmacist-intern registration program (allowed pharmacy students in and out of Texas to become interns in Texas; application form was expanded to include attest questions regarding criminal history).
1999 2000 2001
Texas Legislature required TSBP to register pharmacy technicians, but did not appropriate funding to implement the program.
Staggered biennial renewal of pharmacist and pharmacy licenses began, as well as batch renewals of pharmacy licenses.
Texas Legislature took the following actions: Â· Â· increased the mandatory continuing education requirements to 30 hours; and established conditions through which pharmacy services could be provided through remote pharmacy sites.
2002
TSBP promulgated rules that required pre-inspections of pharmacy applicants, under certain conditions.
In addition, the Board approved the implementation of an expanded application process in order for the agency to obtain sufficient background information to help ensure that the applicant intended to operate a bona fide pharmacy.
Texas Legislature took the following actions: Â· Â· gave the agency the authority to create new classes of pharmacy licenses; appropriated funding for the agency to register pharmacy technicians; and

Â·
gave the agency the authority to require applicants to run federal criminal history background checks for applicants for licensing and licensees.
The key services of the Licensing Program are reflected in the agency's mission statement, which is, to regulate the practice of pharmacy, the operation of pharmacies, and the distribution of prescription drugs in the public interest.
As long as the agency's statutory mission exists, and candidates seek licensure and registration, there will be a need for the program.

Applicants for Licensure by Score Transfer Â­ The NAPLEX Score Transfer Program, administered by the NABP, is a method by which a NAPLEX candidate can take NAPLEX in one state and have the passing score transmitted by NABP to another state.
To participate in this program, the applicant must register with NABP.
Upon receipt of the candidate's passing score, TSBP mails an Application for Licensure by Examination via Score Transfer to applicant.
The applicant must return the completed application to TSBP with a $50 fee, photograph, graduation affidavit, birth certificate, and proof of 1,500 hours of internship (unless the applicant is already licensed and current in another state).
(C)
Applicants for Licensure by License Transfer (Reciprocity) Â­ Upon request, TSBP will mail an application packet containing the following information: Application for Licensure by Reciprocity, instruction sheet, Preliminary NABP application, Candidate's Guide to the MPJE, and registration bulletin for NAPLEX and MPJE exams.
Applicant sends the Preliminary NABP application to NABP with the appropriate fee.
NABP processes the application and returns the official NABP application to the applicant.
The applicant must return the following items to TSBP: completed Texas Reciprocity Application, official NABP application, $250 fee, recent photograph, and birth certificate.
(2)
Receipt of Application Forms/Fees and Review of Application Â­ When TSBP receives the fee payments, the agency deposits the money and forwards the application documents to the designated Licensing Specialist who reviews the application to determine if the application is complete and if the applicant is eligible to take the examinations for licensure.
The agency's computerized data base is updated and a "missing item" letter is generated, if necessary.
Criminal History Background Check Â­ The designated Licensing Specialist orders a criminal history background check on each applicant from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).
If the background check is clear, the application is processed per procedure.
Coordination with Enforcement/Legal Divisions Â­ The application is referred to the Enforcement/Legal Divisions for review if one or more of the following conditions apply: (A) (B) (C) if the applicant checks "yes" to one or more of the attest questions; if the DPS background check is not clear; and/or if the applicant checks "no" to an attest question and the DPS background check indicates that the applicant should have checked "yes" to the attest question.

Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
(5)
Examination Â­ The designated Licensing Specialist will notify the applicant of the scores made on the NAPLEX and MPJE examinations, unless the applicant has an "Administrative Hold" in which case the Licensing Specialist notifies the Director of Enforcement (DOE) of the score.
The DOE, in turn, notifies the Legal Division and one of the Divisions will notify the applicant of the score and potentially, the agency's intent to institute disciplinary action to deny the issuance of the license.
Generally, TSBP will not allow an applicant to take the licensure examination if the agency is instituting disciplinary action to deny the issuance of the license.
TSBP notifies each person taking an examination of the results of the examination not later than the 30th day after the date TSBP receives the results from NABP.
Examination Retakes Â­ If an applicant must retake the NAPLEX and/or MPJE, the applicant is required to: (A) (B) submit a new completed Texas application and the retake fee of $50; and complete the applicable registration form(s) to take the NAPLEX or MPJE or both and send the appropriate retake fees to NABP.
(6)
If the applicant is a reciprocity candidate and the NABP application is over one year old, the applicant must also submit a new application to NABP. (7) Examination Retake Procedures After Three Failures Â­ In accordance with Section 558.055 of the Texas Pharmacy Act, applicants may not retake an examination if they have failed the examination three times, unless documentation is provided from a college of pharmacy stating that the applicant has successfully completed additional course work in the examination subject area the applicant failed.
In this event, the following steps are required for an applicant to retake an exam.
(A) (B) The applicant must submit a written request for an analysis of his/her performance on the exam(s).
The analysis is returned to the applicant after completion by the testing service.
After receiving the analysis, the applicant sends a copy of this document to the Examination Retake Committee (ERC) with a letter requesting that the committee review it and recommend course work.
The ERC reviews the analysis and recommends college course work that must successfully be completed in order to retake the examination.
The ERC notifies the applicant of the resulting recommendation.
After following the recommendations of the ERC and successfully completing the courses set forth in the recommendation, the applicant must submit this documentation to the ERC.
If satisfied that the applicant has complied with its recommendations, the ERC may then submit documentation to TSBP reflecting that the applicant has successfully completed appropriate additional course work.
When TSBP receives such documentation from the ERC, the applicant will receive a schedule of future examination dates, along with application deadlines.
The applicant will then be able to apply for a retake of the examination.

Issuance of Pharmacist License Â­ If all requirements for pharmacist licensure have been met and the applicant has been cleared by the Enforcement/Legal Divisions, a license is issued and the applicant is notified of his/her score and license number.
Included with this notification is a pharmacist license renewal application that the new licensee must complete and submit to TSBP within 30 days of the date of the letter.
If the license renewal application is not completed and submitted with the appropriate fee within 30 days, the license expires and cannot be renewed after one year.
The fee is prorated to coordinate with TSBP's staggered biennial renewal of licenses, based on a licensee's birth month.
Within six weeks of the issuance of the license number, TSBP mails a hand-inscribed license (wall certificate) to the licensee.

Relicensure of Pharmacists Â­ Texas pharmacists whose licenses have lapsed for more than one year must follow the re-licensure process outlined in TSBP Rule 283.10.
The same procedures are used (distributing appropriate application forms, receiving payment/application form, depositing payment, reviewing forms to see if application is complete, and conducting DPS background check).
However, these applicants must also take and pass the MPJE, complete additional hours of CE and may be required to complete internship hours.
In the latter event, the applicant would be required to complete an application to become an Extended Pharmacist-Intern and follow the procedures to obtain the required number of hours.
When all requirements have been met, and the Licensing Specialist has received clearance from the Enforcement/Legal Divisions, TSBP re-issues the license (mails a renewal card to the licensee).
Reinstatement of Pharmacist License Â­ If a Texas pharmacist had his/her license revoked or cancelled as a result of a disciplinary order, the pharmacist is eligible for reinstatement one year after the effective date of the revocation/cancellation.

Are current and future funding resources appropriate to achieve program mission, goals, objectives, and performance targets? Explain.
With the recent budget reductions (7% in FY2003 and 12.5% in FY2004-2005), the agency is struggling to maintain its level of service.
Significant reductions occurred in the areas of travel, salaries, information resource technologies, vehicles, agency newsletter, registration and training, and merit pay.
The budget reductions ($789,696 for FY2004-05) occurred at the same time that new funding ($726,269 for FY2004-2005) was approved to implement an existing agency statutory mandate.
The mandate to register a new population of applicants, the pharmacy technician, requires the agency to double its population of licensees in FY2004 and will cause a dramatic increase in the public's demand for agency services in every area of its operation.
The impact of this new population on the level of services provided by the agency, will significantly impact the agency's ability to provide quality customer service, information and protection to the citizens of Texas.
These areas must be addressed in the next legislative session and additional resources will certainly be requested.

When and for what purpose was the program or function created? Describe any statutory or other requirements for this program or function.
The purpose of the Regulatory Program is an integral part of the agency's mission.
Refer to the agency's response to the first question in the first section of this report (Section 1).
(1) Disciplinary Actions Â­ As early as 1923, the Board was disciplining pharmacists.
The minutes of the Board meeting held on September 18, 1923, indicate that the Board voted to notify two different pharmacists to appear before the Board to show cause why their certificates should not be revoked.
The Board also decided, by unanimous vote, to "go on record as proposing to revoke the certificate to practice pharmacy in Texas of any person, clerk, or proprietor who is convicted or enters a plea of guilty to violating the Harrison Narcotic Act or the violation of the Volstead Prohibition Act or the Dean law."
Investigations Â­ In June 1925, the Board employed its first investigator.
Inspections Â­ TSBP began its comprehensive compliance program in 1977.
This program was created to promote voluntary compliance with the laws and rules governing the practice of pharmacy.
This program included regular, unannounced inspections of pharmacies, publication of TSBP Newsletter, and "online" technical assistance.
The program began with one Compliance Officer and by 1982, had expanded to a field staff of six Compliance Officers.
Legal Services Â­ TSBP employed its first in-house General Counsel in 1986 to handle the increasing caseload of disciplinary actions.
In 2000, the Legal Division, with a General Counsel and two staff attorneys, was created as a separate Division, to handle all legal services as described in the response to Question B (above).

Describe any important history not included in the general agency history section, including a discussion of how the services or functions have changed from the original intent.
Will there be a time when the mission will be accomplished and the program or function will no longer be needed?
The following general government laws must be considered as "important history" to TSBP and its Regulatory Program (and to all other state agencies): (1) (2) (3) (4) Open Meetings Act initially adopted in 1967; Open Records Act initially adopted in 1973 (and replaced by the Texas Public Information Act in 1999); Administrative Procedures Act (APA), previously called Administrative Procedures and Texas Register Act adopted on January 1, 1976; and the law governing the management of state records; this law became effective in 1989 and required TSBP (and all state agencies) to develop a record retention schedule and destroy records only in accordance with an approved schedule.
Specific events that must be considered as "important history" to TSBP's Regulatory Program are listed and described below: 1977 1978 1979 TSBP initiated comprehensive compliance program, to include publication of agency newsletter and routine compliance inspections of pharmacies.
TSBP formed its first task force to assist with the development of proposed rules.
In accordance with the minimum standards of uniform practice and procedure established under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act for the hearing and resolution of contested cases, TSBP began to conduct informal settlement conferences and settle disciplinary cases through informal proceedings.
Prior to 1979, disciplinary cases were considered by the full Board at a formal hearing (referred to as "violation hearings").
This procedure has resulted in dramatic efficiencies with respect to reducing costs and complaint resolution time.
Â· TSBP underwent its first review by the Sunset Advisory Commission.
An updated and modernized Texas Pharmacy Act was enacted, creating four classes of pharmacy licenses, including Class C (Institutional) Pharmacies and Class D (Clinic) Pharmacies.
As a result, inpatient pharmacy services and certain types of clinics (e.g., planned parenthood, public health departments) came under the regulatory authority of TSBP for the first time, which in turn, increased the number of licensees to regulate.
Additionally, the act was amended to clarify that the Board had the authority to inspect pharmacies with the consent of the owner, pharmacist or agent in charge of the pharmacy; absent the pharmacy's agent consent, TSBP may inspect only after obtaining an Administrative Warrant from a court.
1981
-71-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
Â·
The Texas Legislature amended the Texas Controlled Substances Act to require triplicate prescription forms for the issuance of a prescription for a Schedule II controlled substance.
This procedure reduced drug diversion of Schedule II controlled substances (but not drug diversion of Schedule III-V controlled substances).
The Texas Legislature created the Health Professions Council which subsequently funded a toll free telephone number for complainants to use for filing complaints against health professionals, including pharmacists.
This process resulted in TSBP receiving an increased number of complaints (increased workload).
Through amendments to the Texas Pharmacy Act, the Texas Legislature authorized the establishment of a peer assistance program to aid pharmacists impaired by chemical abuse or mental or physical illness.
These amendments stipulated that records relating to impaired pharmacists are confidential and may be disclosed only under very limited conditions.
1983
Â·
Â·
1985
The Texas Legislature amended the Texas Pharmacy Act to expand the peer assistance program to cover pharmacy students who are enrolled in the professional sequence of an accredited pharmacy degree program approved by the Board.
TSBP employed its first in-house General Counsel, which increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's disciplinary process.
The Texas Legislature amended the Texas Pharmacy Act, requiring pharmacists to obtain 12 hours of continuing education (CE) for license renewal.
This change subsequently increased the disciplinary caseload due to audited pharmacists not being able to show proof of completion of the required number of CE hours.
The Texas Legislature passed S.B. 884, creating the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) as an independent agency to conduct hearings to resolve disputes between Texas agencies and public citizens.
SOAH conducted TSBP's first formal hearing in 1992.
Prior to the creation of SOAH, the Board conducted its own disciplinary hearings.
This procedure lengthened the amount of time to close a complaint and increased hearing costs.
TSBP underwent its second review by the Sunset Advisory Commission.
The Texas Pharmacy Act was amended as a result of several recommendations made by the Sunset Advisory Commission, to include: granting TSBP the authority to temporarily suspend a pharmacist's license under certain conditions and imposing numerous requirements relating to complaint procedures, such as: Â· maintaining complaint files;
1986 1989
1991
1993
-72-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
Â·
establishing policies and procedures concerning the investigation of a complaint filed with the Board, to include: determining the seriousness of the complaint, ensuring that complaints are not closed without appropriate consideration, ensuring that a letter is sent to the person who filed the complaint explaining the action taken on the complaint; and ensuring that the person who filed the complaint has an opportunity to explain the allegations made in the complaint; notifying complainants of the receipt of the complaint no later than 30 days after the date of the receipt of the complaint and every four months until the complaint is closed; providing reasonable assistance to the complainant; and giving the complainant the opportunity to attend an informal settlement conference; distributing information to the general public describing the functions of the Board and the procedures by which complaints are filed with and resolved by the Board; and notifying complainants of the Board's name, address, and telephone number through such methods as a complaint sign prominently displayed in a pharmacy.
Â·
Â·
Â· 1995
The Texas Legislature transferred the authority for inspection prescription balances from the Texas Department of Agriculture to TSBP.
As a result of this change, more time was required to conduct inspections.
The Texas Legislature passed S.B. 730, which amended the Texas Pharmacy Act to require insurers or other entities who provide professional liability insurance (to pharmacists, pharmacies and pharmacy technicians) to furnish information regarding malpractice reports (claims against the insured for failing to provide appropriate service within the scope of pharmaceutical services).
TSBP must review the information (if three or more claims have been reported within a five-year period) in the same manner as if a complaint had been made against the individual.
This amendment has substantially increased the Regulatory Program's workload.
Texas State Board of Medical Examiners (TSBME) published guidelines regarding Internet prescribing.
TSBP promulgated rules in concert with the TSBME guidelines.
These rules state that a pharmacist may not dispense a prescription without a valid doctor-patient relationship, and that a valid doctor-patient relationship does not exist if the patient has merely had an "Internet or online consultation."
TSBP began investigating Internet pharmacy practice.
These types of cases are very complex and expensive to investigate.
Â· The Texas Legislature amended the Texas Pharmacy Act (H.B.99) to require TSBP to accept complaints through the Internet.
After TSBP implemented an online complaint system, TSBP experienced a sizeable increase in the number of complaints being filed.
The Texas Legislature passed S.B. 768 which transferred the authority of the regulation of emergency kits in nursing homes from Texas Department of Human Services (TDHS) to TSBP.
Although the rider to the bill provided funding for 1 FTE, the Appropriations Act did not increase the FTE cap for TSBP.
TSBP met with TDHS staff on April 5, 2002, and sent a follow-up letter, requesting that

Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
TDHS enter into an interagency contract with TSBP, in which TSBP would agree to pay a reasonable fee to TDHS to inspect emergency kits in nursing homes.
TSBP did not receive a written response from TDHS. 2002 TSBP began to receive complaints regarding "pharmacy storefront operations" that were assisting patients to receive drugs from Canadian pharmacies.
TSBP has serious concerns regarding the legality, safety and efficacy of drugs that are imported to Texas patients.
The Texas Legislature appropriated funds for TSBP to register pharmacy technicians.
This new program will result in approximately 26,500 additional individuals for TSBP to regulate.
2003
The original purpose or intent of the Regulatory Program was to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
Although laws, rules, policies/procedures, and society's increasing use of licit and illicit drugs have changed over time, the original intent of the Regulatory Program has remained to protect the public health.
When the Pharmacy Act was amended ("modernize/updated") in 1981, the purpose/intent of the Board's mission was expanded to include "promoting" and "preserving" (as well as "protecting") the public health, safety and welfare, and these additional concepts have been incorporated into the TSBP Regulatory Program.
In the interest of public health, the TSBP Regulatory Program will always be needed.

Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
These degree programs must be recognized and approved by the Board, in order for the respective graduates to be eligible for a license in this state.
Refer to the Texas Pharmacy Act, Section 554.002(3).
In addition, TSBP must annually review and approve the internship programs of the Texas colleges of pharmacy: refer to TSBP Rule 283.4(c)(1)(A).
There are approximately 1,700 pharmacy students in Texas (i.e., students who are enrolled in the professional sequence in one of the four above-mentioned academic programs).
In addition, the Regulatory Program affects all consumers of services provided by persons licensed or registered by TSBP.
The number of persons or entities who receive pharmacy services is unknown, but the potential market is all Texas residents, as well as a substantial number of residents of other states who obtain pharmacy services from pharmacies licensed by TSBP.
Out-of-state patients receive prescriptions from TSBP-licensed pharmacies that dispense/deliver medications by mail (i.e., mail service pharmacies).
Mail service pharmacies will be licensed as one of the following: (1) mail service pharmacies that are located in Texas Â­ these pharmacies are licensed by TSBP as Class A (Community) Pharmacies; they dispense/ship prescription drugs to patients living in Texas and/or in other states.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES COMPLAI NT
PRO
CESS
The Board Members set the policies regarding the resolution of complaints and agency staff carry out the policies.
The Board periodically reviews and approves the policies and procedures for handling complaints.
See Attachment #D for a description of the policies and procedures for handling complaints, as reviewed and approved by the Board on May 8, 2002.
Attachment D also includes a flow chart of the complaint process.
The primary steps of the complaint process are described below: (1) Submission of Complaint Â­ Complaints must be submitted in writing, except in unusual circumstances.
Complainants may submit a complaint via a TSBP complaint form, a letter, or online complaint form.
Written complaints may be submitted by fax, U.S. mail, or email.
If a complainant telephones TSBP or the HPC Complaint Hotline (800-8213205) and provides his/her name and address, the TSBP Enforcement Division staff will mail a TSBP complaint form to the complainant.
In FY2002, TSBP mailed 1,524 complaint forms to complainants.

Receipt of Complaint Â­ When a complaint is received, agency staff complete a complaint worksheet (determine data entry codes for source, form, subject of complaint, type of violation and draft concise summary/description of complaint for data entry purposes).
The coded worksheet is routed to the responsible administrative assistant ("AA") who data enters the complaint into the agency's complaint tracking system and prepares the complaint file.
Determination of Jurisdictional Issues Â­ The AA routes the complaint/file (and files relating to the subject's prior history) to the Enforcement Specialist ("ES"), who double checks the AA's data entry information for errors and determines if the complaint is a jurisdictional complaint.
If the complaint is not within the agency's jurisdiction to handle, the complaint is routed to the Assistant Director of Enforcement ("ADE") for review.
If the ADE confirms that the complaint is non-jurisdictional, the ADE closes the complaint with no action and the complainant is notified of the agency's decision.
If there is any question regarding jurisdictional issues, the ADE consults with Director of Enforcement ("DOE") and/or General Counsel (the consultation may occur during a complaint/case review: see Step #9).
Initial Review of the Complaint Â­ After determining the complaint is a jurisdictional complaint, the ES determines whether TSBP must obtain a Complainant Waiver Form and/or a Medical Release to obtain the patient's medical records.
The ES routes the complaint/files to the AA to acknowledge the receipt of the complaint and obtain additional information, if applicable.
The ES advises the AA as to "next step" with respect to the assignment of the complaint (see Step #6 below).
Acknowledgment of Receipt of Complaint Â­ The AA prepares applicable letter to complainant.
If Waiver Form and/or Medical Release forms are needed, the AA holds the complaint in a suspense file until the forms are received.
If the forms are not received by the due date, the complaint/file is routed to the DOE for review.
If the complaint can be resolved/closed without the requested forms, the DOE assigns the complaint to an in-house investigator ("EO") to handle.
If the complaint involves a dispensing error, the DOE assigns the complaint to an EO who attempts to telephone the complainant to discuss the matter.
If the complainant does not wish to cooperate, the complaint/file is returned to DOE, who closes the complaint and notifies the complainant of the decision.
Assignment of Complaint Â­ See response to Question L (below) regarding the Board's philosophy with respect to the approach the agency takes to handle complaints.
In accordance with this approach, complaints may be assigned to an in-house investigator or a field investigator, depending upon the nature of the complaint/violation(s) alleged and the licensee's prior complaint history on file with the Board.
Field investigations are conducted only when the complaint is likely to result in disciplinary action being instituted against the subject of the complaint.
In-house investigations generally result in a less punitive action (such as a verbal or written warning).
The ES reviews the nature of the complaint violations and the licensee's previous complaint history, and recommends assignment of complaint in accordance with Board policy: if complaint allegations are egregious, the complaint is assigned to a field investigator (regardless of whether the licensee has prior complaint history); if licensee has no prior complaint history and the complaint allegations are not egregious, the complaint is assigned to an in-house investigator.

Field Investigations Â­ If the ES determines the complaint should be handled with a field investigation, the ES routes the complaint to the DOE for review.
The DOE consults with the Chief of Investigations, who assigns the complaint to a field investigator.
In-House Investigations Â­ If the ES determines the complaint should be handled with an in-house investigation, the ES routes the complaint to an EO.
(B)
If the ES has any question with regard to how the complaint is to be handled (e.g., either through an in-house investigation or through a field investigation), the ES consults with ADE and/or DOE, who makes assignment.
If DOE has any question with regard to how the complaint is to be handled, the DOE consults with the Executive Director ("ED") and/or Legal Staff (consultation may occur at a complaint/case review: see step #9 below).
(7) Investigation of Complaint Â­ In-house investigators interview complainants and subjects of complaints by telephone and collect records/evidence by mail.
Field investigators conduct face-to-face interviews with complainants/subjects of complaints, and obtain affidavits and other evidence from complainants and subjects of complaints.
Field investigators conduct both covert and overt investigations, including accountability audits and on-site, in-depth investigations of pharmacy operations.
Investigations are prioritized.
The Board sets the priorities for investigations each year, when it sets its annual goals and objectives.
See FY2003 Goals and Objectives, Enforcement Division, Ongoing Objective #3 (Attachment #E ) for a list of investigative priorities for FY2003.
Preliminary Complaint/Case Review Â­ After the investigation has been completed and the report has been prepared, the complaint/file is submitted to and reviewed by a supervisor, as described below: (A) Field Investigations Â­ field investigators' cases are initially submitted to the Chief of Investigations (non-pharmacist) for review; if the Chief determines that the investigation is complete, the Chief routes the case to the DOE (a pharmacist) for review; if the DOE determines that the investigation is complete, the DOE routes the case to the Legal Division for review; then the case is reviewed with the Executive Director ("ED"): see Step #9.
If the Chief, DOE or General Counsel determines that the investigation is incomplete, the case is returned to the case agent for additional investigation.
In-house Investigations Â­ Â· in-house investigators' cases are submitted to DOE for review, if the complaint is to be closed with a written warning per Board policy (DOE reviews and signs all warning letters); and in-house investigators' cases are submitted to ADE for review, if the complaint is to be closed with no written warning.

Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
If the DOE or ADE determines that the investigation is incomplete, the case is returned to the case agent for additional investigation.
If investigation is complete, the complaint is closed by DOE (after written warning is mailed) or ADE (with final review by DOE).
If there is any question with regard to how the complaint should be closed, a final review is conducted with E.D./Legal Staff (see Step #9).
(9) Complaint/Case Review Â­ These reviews are held approximately every two weeks and are attended by the ED, General Counsel, DOE and other staff of the Legal and Enforcement Divisions.
The following types of decisions are made at complaint/case reviews: whether a complaint should be investigated; what type of investigation should be conducted (i.e., in-house or field investigation); whether additional investigation is needed to make a decision about the action to take on a complaint; and how the complaint should be closed, specifically, whether disciplinary action should be instituted.
Complaint Closed or Referred to the Legal Division for Institution of Disciplinary Action Â­ If after a final review, the decision has been made not to institute disciplinary action, the complaint is closed and the complainant is notified of the decision.
If the complaint is closed with a warning letter, the complainant receives a copy of the letter.
If the decision has been made to institute disciplinary action, the complaint/file is routed to the Legal Division (see "Disciplinary Process").

Assignment of Case Â­ After investigation has been completed and the Legal Division has accepted the case, the General Counsel assigns the case to one of two staff attorneys who is responsible for prosecuting the case.
The case assignment is logged into Abacus, a specialized software system that the Legal Division uses to track the status of a case as it goes through the disciplinary process.
Preliminary Notice Letter (PNL) Â­ The prosecuting attorney prepares the first draft of the PNL in accordance with established procedures.
The PNL contains the following information: statement of charges that describe the alleged violation(s) that the respondent has allegedly committed; the list of laws and/or rules that the respondent has allegedly violated; copies of applicable evidence that supports the charges being made against the respondent; a detailed explanation of the disciplinary process, including a description of the respondent's rights; and a cover letter that advises the respondent that the agency is considering the institution of disciplinary action against the respondent and offers the respondent the opportunity to attend an informal settlement conference (ISC).
The cover letter provides the date and time of the ISC.
The PNL is reviewed by DOE and General Counsel before it is mailed to the respondent.
Informal Settlement Conference (ISC) Â­ Multiple informal settlement conferences are held over the course of several days (approximately eight conferences are held each day for three consecutive days a month during eight months a year).
The conferences are held at the TSBP office.
One Board Member attends the ISC, along with the Executive Director, General Counsel, prosecuting attorney, and other applicable staff (e.g., DOE; Chief of Investigation).
The TSBP General Counsel conducts the ISC and explains the charges against the respondent.
The respondent is given the opportunity to respond to the charges and show compliance with the law (i.e., present evidence to show why the respondent should not be charged with the allegations and why
(2)
(3)
-80-

disciplinary action should not be taken against the respondent).
If the respondent is unable to show compliance with the law, the respondent may present any other pertinent information (e.g., mitigating circumstances).
After hearing the evidence, the ISC panel either recommends dismissal of the case or proposes a disciplinary sanction to settle the case.
The respondent is not required to make a decision at the ISC regarding the panel's recommendation.
See Attachment #F for a description of the informal settlement conference procedures.
(4) Proposed Agreed Board Order (ABO) Â­ If the ISC panel recommends that disciplinary action be taken against a respondent, the TSBP prosecuting attorney drafts a proposed ABO.
This proposed order is mailed to the respondent or respondent's attorney, if the respondent is being represented by counsel.
If the respondent agrees to the terms of the proposed order, the respondent signs the proposed order and returns it to TSBP.
The proposed order is presented to the Board at its next regularly scheduled Board Meeting.
If the Board agrees to the terms of the proposed order, by vote of the majority, the order is entered.
TSBP notifies the respondent of the entry of the Agreed Board Order within 30 days of the entry of the order.
Waiving the ISC Â­ In certain types of cases, in accordance with established guidelines set by the Board, the agency mails the PNL to respondent together with a proposed ABO.
In these cases, the respondent has the opportunity to attend an ISC or waive the ISC, by signing and returning the proposed ABO that is enclosed with the PNL.
This procedure expedites the disciplinary process and saves the respondent's time and resources, as well as the agency's time and resources.
When Informal Settlement Fails Â­ A case cannot be settled through informal proceedings if one of the following events occur: the respondent rejects the terms and conditions of the proposed ABO or does not sign/return the proposed ABO; the Board rejects the terms of the proposed ABO; or the respondent does not appear at an ISC.
If one of these events occurs, TSBP (the prosecuting attorney) files a complaint with the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH), who sets the case for a formal public hearing.
Mediated Settlement Conference Â­ Prior to a formal hearing being conducted, either TSBP, the respondent or SOAH may request that the case be scheduled for a formal mediation process.
SOAH conducts the mediation.
If the mediation is successful, the case is settled with a proposed ABO that is presented to the Board at its next regularly scheduled Board meeting.
Formal Hearing Â­ TSBP mails a Notice of Hearing to the respondent (notifies the respondent of the time, date and place of the hearing, along with the charges and laws/rules that have been allegedly violated).
On the designated date, time and place, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at SOAH conducts the hearing in the presence of a court reporter.
Evidence is presented by TSBP and respondent.

Proposal for Decision (PFD) Â­ The ALJ issues a PFD that sets forth Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and a recommended disciplinary sanction.
The PFD is presented to the Board at its next regularly scheduled Board meeting.
The Board votes whether to accept the ALJ's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which are routinely accepted unless an error is made or compelling policy reasons dictate otherwise.
The Board also votes on the ALJ's recommended disciplinary sanction.
Board Order Â­ The TSBP prosecuting attorney drafts the proposed Board Order for the Board's review and consideration at the Board meeting.
The proposed Board Order contains the ALJ's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and recommended sanction.
If the Board accepts the Findings, Conclusions, and recommended sanction, by majority vote, the Board Order is entered.
TSBP notifies the respondent of the entry of the Board Order within 30 days of the entry of the order.
The respondent has the right to appeal the Board Order in accordance with the provisions of the Texas Administrative Procedures Act.

Regions Â­ Each Compliance Officer is responsible for inspecting pharmacies in an assigned region of Texas.
For purposes of inspections, the state is divided into seven regions.
See Attachment #G for map of regions.
Pharmacies in the seventh region (Harris County) are inspected by one of the two Compliance Officers who are located in Houston.
Scheduling of Inspections Â­ Inspections are conducted on an unannounced basis and generally average one to two hours in length.
Texas pharmacies are inspected approximately every two years.
Compliance Officers determine their own weekly schedules and are expected to maximize efficiencies by managing time and travel.
To assist in efficient routing, Austin headquarters provides a "region roster" to each Compliance Officer.
Region rosters are computerized printouts listing all pharmacies in the region, by zip code.
The list includes the name and address of the pharmacy and additional information about the pharmacy (such as the name of the current pharmacistin-charge, the date of the last inspection, and the deficiencies noted during the last inspection).
Priorities for Inspections Â­ Compliance Officers plan their itinerary based on established priorities.
The Board sets the priorities for inspections each year, when it sets its annual goals and objectives.
See FY2003 Goals and Objectives, Enforcement Division, Ongoing Objective #2 (Attachment #E) for a list of inspection priorities for FY2003.
Notice of Inspection and Inspection Report Form Â­ When Compliance Officers enter the pharmacy, they state their purpose, issue a Notice of Inspection, and identify themselves with credentials.
The pharmacist on duty reads and signs the Notice, which grants TSBP the right to inspect the pharmacy.
If the pharmacist on duty does not sign the Notice, TSBP must obtain an Administrative Warrant (from a court) before the inspection can be conducted.
After the Notice is signed, the Compliance Officer checks the pharmacy's environment, equipment, drug stock, records, and practices/procedures.
The Compliance Officer determines the degree of compliance for each item on the

Inspection Report Form and indicates "satisfactory" or "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory."
See Attachment #H for a copy of Notice of Inspection and Inspection Report Form.
(5) Unsatisfactory Conditions Â­ TSBP uses two different methods to handle unsatisfactory conditions, as described below: (A) Written Warning Notice Â­ Compliance Officers may issue a written Warning Notice for certain unsatisfactory conditions, in accordance with established guidelines.
The Warning Notice will give the pharmacy a due date to correct the conditions and submit a detailed report to TSBP outlining the changes that have been made.
The due date is generally 30 days from the date of the inspection.
Exceptions: a due date of 10 days is given if the condition is a potential or imminent risk to public health (e.g., animals in the pharmacy); a due date of 90 days is given if the pharmacy must make major changes requiring an extended period of time (e.g., the pharmacy must undergo construction or make major changes to its computerized record keeping system).
See Attachment #I for a copy of Warning Notice form.
Refer Case to the Legal Division for Review Â­ For certain types of violations, in accordance with established guidelines, Compliance Officers may become investigators and collect evidence.
The Compliance Officer advises the pharmacist on duty that the case will be referred to the Legal Division for review.
The Compliance Officer submits the evidence with a written report to the DOE.
If case is complete, the case is reviewed at a case/complaint review (see Step #9 under "Complaint Process" above), whereupon the case may result in disciplinary action against the pharmacy and its pharmacist-in-charge.
(B)
(6)
Response to Warning Notice Â­ TSBP monitors the receipt of the pharmacy's response to the Warning Notice.
(A) Satisfactory Response Â­ Austin headquarters acknowledges the receipt of the response and sends a copy of the response to the applicable Compliance Officer.
Unsatisfactory Response Â­ If the pharmacy does not specifically state that the pharmacy has corrected the condition, TSBP notifies the pharmacy in writing that the response is unsatisfactory and states that the response be re-submitted.
No Response Â­ If the pharmacy fails to respond to the Warning Notice by the specified due date, TSBP notifies the pharmacy in writing (by certified mail) that failure to submit a response may result in the institution of disciplinary action against the licensee.
If the pharmacy does not respond to the certified letter from TSBP, a complaint is opened and referred to the Legal Division for review and possible institution of disciplinary action.
(B)
(C)
(7)
Follow-up Inspections Â­ After the Compliance Officer receives notice that the pharmacy has satisfactorily responded to the Warning Notice, the Compliance Officer may conduct a follow-up inspection to ensure that the pharmacy has corrected the conditions as stated in the response to the Warning Notice.
The follow-up inspection is an
-83-

"abbreviated inspection" (i.e., Compliance Officer only checks the areas that were marked "needs improvement" or the "unsatisfactory" conditions that resulted in the Warning Notice being issued.
If the pharmacy has not corrected the conditions as described in the pharmacy's Response to Warning Notice, the Compliance Officer files a complaint with the Director of Enforcement and the case is referred to the Legal Division.
(8) Pre-Licensure Inspections Â­ These types of inspections are conducted prior to the issuance of a pharmacy license, to ensure that the applicant for a pharmacy license is intending to operate a bona-fide pharmacy.
CESS
MONITORING PRO (1)
Notification of Terms and Conditions of Disciplinary Orders Â­ TSBP notifies respondents of the entry of Agreed Board Orders and Board Orders within 30 days of the entry of the order.
TSBP mails a copy of the order to the respondent with a cover letter that explains in explicit detail all the terms and conditions of the order, including specific due dates for all reports and other documents required to be submitted to TSBP.
This process helps the respondent understand their responsibilities with respect to their compliance with the provisions of the order.
Inspections Â­ The Director of Enforcement (DOE) notifies all field personnel of the orders that have entered on licensees.
The DOE requests the applicable field compliance officer to conduct inspections of pharmacies that have been revoked or suspended, or pharmacies that employed a pharmacist whose license has been revoked, retired, or suspended, in order to determine if the licensee is practicing or operating a pharmacy during the period of revocation, retirement of suspension.
The DOE also requests the applicable field compliance officer to conduct inspections of licensees who are on probation or other types of disciplinary orders which are necessary to determine if the licensee is in compliance with the terms of the disciplinary order.
Peer Assistance Program Â­ TSBP has a contract with the Pharmacy Recovery Network (PRN), a "voluntary" peer assistance program administered by the Texas Pharmacy Association, to aid impaired pharmacists.
See Attachment #J for information regarding the PRN Program.
The Director of the PRN Program monitors individuals who self-report themselves to the program or who are referred to the program by a relative, colleague, or TSBP.
After a licensee or an eligible pharmacy student is referred to the PRN Program, the PRN Director refers the individual to a mental health professional (MHP) for an evaluation.
If the MHP determines the individual has an impairment, the individual must sign a rehabilitation contract with the PRN Program.
The PRN Program monitors the individual's treatment program, including attendance at AA or similar types of support meetings, and conducts unannounced, random drug screens.
If this individual successfully completes the terms of this contract, TSBP will never become aware of this individual's identity.
However, the Director of the PRN Program will refer the individual to TSBP under the following circumstances: (A) if this individual does not cooperate with the PRN Program (i.e., does not agree to be evaluated or does not agree to sign the PRN contract); and/or
(2)
(3)
-84-

(B)
if this individual signs a PRN contract and experiences a relapse (e.g., positive drug screen for a controlled substance that has not been dispensed pursuant to a valid prescription).
After receiving a referral from the PRN Program, TSBP initiates a complaint, conducts an investigation, and if sufficient evidence is collected, institutes disciplinary action against the licensee.
(4) Typical Terms and Conditions Imposed by Disciplinary Orders Â­ In FY2001, 90% of the disciplinary orders entered by TSBP required some type of monitoring.
In FY2002, 80% of the disciplinary orders entered by TSBP required some type of monitoring.
(A) Rehabilitation orders Â­ The standard rehabilitation order imposes a five-year probation on the impaired/recovering pharmacist and requires intense monitoring by TSBP due to the numerous terms and conditions set forth in the disciplinary order, including the following: Â· requiring the impaired/recovering pharmacist to submit quarterly self reports for the purpose of informing TSBP of the licensee's status and conduct, including rehabilitation activities (e.g., signed attendance logs if licensee is required to attend 12-step meetings) and employment status (e.g., signed supervision logs if required to work under the supervision of another pharmacist). requiring the impaired/recovering pharmacist to work under the supervision of another pharmacist; in this event, the supervising pharmacist must submit quarterly reports regarding the impaired/recovering pharmacist's status and conduct (e.g., compliance with the laws/rules pertaining to the practice of pharmacy; conformance to work rules; relationship with other employees and customers; overall job performance; and any other relevant matter). requiring the impaired/recovering pharmacist's mental health professional (MHP) to submit quarterly reports regarding the status and conduct of the licensee, as long as the licensee is under the care of a MHP. requiring the impaired/recovering pharmacist to submit to random drug screens (see below).
Â·

Â· (B)
Orders Imposing Drug Screens Â­ TSBP has a contract with the National Confederation of Professional Services (NCPS) to administer a drug screening program for TSBP.
NCPS provides the following services to TSBP: Â· an online (Internet-based) system through which TSBP sets drug screening regimens for pharmacists who are required by a disciplinary order to submit to unannounced drug screens (hereinafter, referred to as "probationers");
-85-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
Â·
an 800 number for probationers to telephone each weekday (the probationer enters his/her unique PIN number on the touch tone pad and the system will inform the caller whether he/she has been selected to submit to a drug screen that day); and swift online reporting of the probationers' compliance or non-compliance (e.g., through the Web-based system, TSBP can determine what days the probationer called the 800 number and the time of the call; what days the probationer did not call the 800 number; whether the probationer submitted to a drug screen on the required day; and if the drug screen was negative or positive).
Â·
(C)
Orders Requiring Submission of Policies and Procedures Â­ Disciplinary orders against pharmacies may require the pharmacy to submit policies and procedures addressing how the pharmacy is going to prevent the alleged violation from recurring.
For example, when a pharmacy has been the subject of a disciplinary order due to a dispensing error, the order generally requires the pharmacy to develop and implement a Continuous Quality Improvement Program (to include a peer review component) for the purposes of preventing and handling dispensing errors and submit a report describing the program.
Orders Imposing Additional Continuing Education (CE) Â­ If a disciplinary order requires the licensee to obtain additional CE, the license is required to submit proof of attendance at the required CE programs (i.e., copies of CE certificates).
TSBP tracks whether the licensee submits the required report regarding the CE.
If the licensee submits the required CE certificates, TSBP conducts an audit of CE records claimed on the licensee's renewal application to ensure that the licensee did not "double count" the CE (i.e., using the CE to satisfy the terms of the disciplinary order, as well as for license renewal purposes, which would be a violation of the terms of the order).
CE audits are also conducted on probationers.
Orders Imposing Administrative Penalties Â­ After the entry of a disciplinary order requiring the payment of an administrative penalty (fine) or probation fee, the Enforcement Division notifies the Administrative Services Division (Enforcement Division prepares a list of all licensees that owe a fine and/or probation fee, including the licensee's name, license number, amount due, and due date).
The Administrative Services Division monitors whether a licensee pays his/her fine or probation fee by the due date.
If the licensee does not pay his/her fine or fee by the due date, the Administrative Services Division notifies the DOE.
The DOE or designee opens a complaint, telephones the licensee, and gives 10 days to submit payment.
If payment is not received within 10 days, the complaint is referred to the Legal Division for the institution of disciplinary action.
(D)
(E)
(5)
Tracking Due Dates Â­ Information regarding disciplinary orders is data entered into the agency's computerized complaint tracking system, including the entry of information regarding specific terms and conditions with applicable due dates.
When required reports or other documents are received, the computerized "tickler system" is updated with the next due date.
When the final report or document is submitted to TSBP, the computer is updated to show an ending date (i.e., no due date).

Non-Compliance with Terms of Disciplinary Order Â­ (A) Drug Screens Â­ As explained above, NCPS monitors licensees' compliance with their drug screening requirements.
TSBP would open a complaint if any one of the following three events occurred: Â· if TSBP is notified that a probationer has tested positive for an illicit drug, TSBP opens a complaint, notifies the probationer to surrender his/her license pending a hearing, and the case is immediately referred to the TSBP Legal Division for the institution of disciplinary action against the license; if TSBP is notified that a probationer has tested positive for a licit drug and TSBP has no prescription on file from the probationer for this drug, TSBP opens a complaint and notifies the licensee to surrender his/her license pending a hearing, or alternatively, produce a current prescription for the drug that caused the positive drug screen; this complaint would be referred to the TSBP Legal Division for the institution of disciplinary action if the probationer could not produce a valid prescription; and if TSBP is notified that a probationer has not submitted to a drug screen on the required day, TSBP opens a complaint.
If this non-compliance is the probationer's first missed drug screen, the complaint is closed with a warning letter.
However, if the probationer has received a prior warning letter for a missed drug screen, the case is immediately referred to the TSBP Legal Division for the institution of disciplinary action.
Â·
Â·
(B)
Required Reports Â­ Computerized reports listing "past due reports" are automatically generated each week.
Enforcement Division staff use this report to identify a licensee's non-compliance.
When Enforcement Division staff confirm that the licensee is in non-compliance with the terms of his/her disciplinary order, a complaint is opened and action is taken.
The type of action that is taken depends upon the degree of non-compliance, the type of non-compliance, and the pattern of non-compliance.
Complaints involving non-compliance may be closed through non-punitive methods (verbal warning, written warning, or inspection) or frequently, will be closed following an investigation and institution of disciplinary action.

I.
Are current and future funding resources appropriate to achieve program mission, goals, objectives, and performance targets? Explain.
TSBP believes that additional funding is needed to carry out its mission, particularly in light of the budget cutbacks mandated by the 78th Texas Legislature.
The Enforcement Division has only five field investigators and 5.25 inspectors for the entire state, resulting in each field employee having vast territories to regulate.
Moreover, TSBP will be implementing a new program in FY2004 to register 26,500 pharmacy technicians.
The pharmacy technician registration program will double the number of persons being regulated by the agency and will stretch the Regulatory Program's employees to the breaking point.
J.
Identify any programs internal or external to the agency that provide identical or similar services or functions.
Describe the similarities and differences.
Internal Programs Â­ The Regulatory Program works closely with other programs within the agency, in the following ways: (A) Enforcement Division works closely with the TSBP Accounting Section to ensure that administrative penalties (fines), probation fees, and charges for producing records are paid; Enforcement and Legal Divisions work closely with the Pharmacist Licensing Section to ensure that applicants with a criminal history record or record of disciplinary actions in other states are not licensed until the application has been thoroughly reviewed by the Enforcement and/or Legal Divisions;
(1)
(B)
-90-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
(C)
Enforcement Division and Legal Divisions work closely with the Pharmacy Licensing Section to ensure that applicants with a criminal history record are not licensed until the application has been thoroughly reviewed by the Enforcement and/or Legal Divisions; Enforcement Division works closely with the Pharmacist Renewal Licensing Section to ensure that pharmacists who have not completed the required CE for relicensure are referred to the Legal Division for institution of disciplinary action; and Licensing Section also provides information about agency services and information about public licensing records.
(D)
(E) (2)
External Programs (A) Similar enforcement programs and functions are provided by state boards of pharmacy in other states.
The Texas Pharmacy Act requires pharmacies that are located in other states (but dispense/deliver prescriptions to patients in Texas) to obtain a Class E (Non-Resident) Pharmacy license.
These pharmacies must also be licensed in the state where they are located.
The Texas Department of Health (TDH) licenses and regulates hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers.
Class C (Institutional) Pharmacies are located in these facilities.
TDH personnel may conduct inspections in hospitals, including the pharmacy.
Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) contracts with pharmacies to provide services to Medicaid patients.
HHSC has regional pharmacists who conduct annual on-site visits to vendor pharmacies to check compliance with contract provisions.
The Medicaid Fraud Unit of the Attorney General's office (AGMFU) investigate complaints involving Medicaid Fraud by pharmacies and pharmacists.
(B)
(C)
K.
Discuss how the program or function is coordinating its activities to avoid duplication or conflict with the other programs listed in Question J and with the agency's customers.
If applicable, briefly discuss any memorandums of understanding (MOUs), interagency agreements, or interagency contracts.
Hospitals Â­ If a hospital is accredited by Joint Commission on Accreditation of Heathcare Organizations (JCAHO), a private non-profit organization, TDH will not conduct an inspection of the hospital except in unusual circumstances (e.g., a complaint has been filed against the facility).
TDH shares its investigative complaints with TSBP.
Pharmacies located in Texas Â­ HHSC employs regional pharmacists to conduct annual visits at pharmacies that are serving Medicaid patients.
Not all pharmacies serve Medicaid patients and these annual visits are not complete inspections.
HHSC regional pharmacists only check for contract violations (Medicaid Fraud).
Their visits are annual, while TSBP inspections are conducted approximately every other year and constitute more in depth inspections.
However, if HHSC regional pharmacists observe violations -91-
(1)
(2)
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
or items that are unsatisfactory during their visits, HHSC forwards the information to TSBP for review and possible action against the licensees involved.
TSBP works closely with AGMFU on cases involving Medicaid Fraud by pharmacists/pharmacies.
(3) Class E Pharmacies (pharmacies located in other states) Â­ TSBP refers complaints on Class E Pharmacies to the state board of pharmacy where the pharmacy is located.
If that state board does not take disciplinary action on the complaint within the time period set forth in Section 565.053 of the Texas Pharmacy Act, TSBP may do so.
L.
Please provide any additional information needed to gain a preliminary understanding of the program or function.
TSBP takes a dual approach to enforcement, which includes "prevention" (through education) and "treatment" (disciplinary sanctions) for violators of pharmacy and drug laws.
TSBP believes that 95% of the pharmacists will obey the laws/rules governing the practice of pharmacy if they are aware of the requirements of the laws/rules and understand the requirements.
Accordingly, TSBP takes great efforts to educate pharmacists via inspections, the TSBP Newsletter, speaking engagements/ presentations, and "online" technical assistance.
TSBP handles complaints in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible.
After complaints are received, they are reviewed to determine the seriousness of the violation and the licensee's prior complaint history.
If a licensee has no prior complaint history and the allegations are not egregious, the complaint will be closed with a written warning, in accordance with Board policies and procedures, unless the violation is minor, in which case, the complaint will be closed following a phone call (or verbal admonition).
However, if a complaint involves an egregious violation (e.g., diversion of controlled substances), or a pattern of complaints/violations, the complaint will be assigned to a field investigator to conduct an in-depth investigation.
If sufficient evidence is collected during the investigation, the case will result in the institution of disciplinary action against the licensees involved.
Accordingly, not all complaints result in disciplinary action being taken against a licensee.
TSBP settles almost all of its disciplinary cases with an Agreed Board Order (consent order), which results in significant efficiencies, both in terms of complaint resolution time and costs.
These orders do not contain Findings of Fact or Conclusions of Law (i.e., no finding of guilt).
The licensee does not admit nor deny the allegations set out in the order, but the licensee agrees to the sanction.
Over the past 5 fiscal years (FY1998FY2002), TSBP entered 744 disciplinary orders and 733 of the orders were Agreed Board Orders (an average settlement rate of 98.6% over the past 5 years).
Violations of Texas and Federal Drug Laws subject pharmacists and pharmacies to criminal penalties, as well as administrative sanctions against their licenses to practice and operate a pharmacy.
(1)

Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
(5)
The regulation of the practice of pharmacy is highly specialized and complex.
Regulatory Program staff are required to investigate, inspect, and prosecute complaints involving numerous pharmacy and drug laws (e.g., Texas and Federal Controlled Substances Act; Texas and Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; Texas Dangerous Drug Act; Texas Pharmacy Act) and rules promulgated pursuant to these Acts.
The TSBP Rules, alone, span approximately 200 pages.
In order to carry out their duties, Regulatory Program staff are required to have a thorough knowledge of all the aforementioned laws/rules.
TSBP issues five different types of pharmacy licenses: (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) Class A (Community) Pharmacies Class B (Nuclear) Pharmacies Class C (Institutional) Pharmacies Class D (Clinic) Pharmacies Class E (Non-Resident) Pharmacies
(6)
Each class of pharmacy has a unique set of rules and operating standards.
Compliance Officers/Inspectors are required to check for non-compliance in a particular class of pharmacy applying the operating standards for that class.
Accordingly, inspection procedures are complex and challenging.
Until budget cuts mandated by the 78th Texas Legislature, TSBP employed pharmacists to conduct these inspections.
The budget cuts will force the agency to replace pharmacist Compliance Officers with non-pharmacist inspectors.
(7) TSBP employs five commissioned peace officers.
Pursuant to Section 554.010 of the Texas Pharmacy Act, these employees have all the powers, privileges, and immunities of a peace officer, except they may not carry a firearm or make an arrest.
TSBP is authorized to maintain an in-house Texas Law Enforcement Telecommunications System that allows the agency to send and receive statewide and national messages of inquiry concerning criminal history records of those individuals under investigation by this division.
(8)
M.
Regulatory programs relate to the licensing, registration, certification, or permitting of a person, business, or other entity.
If this is a regulatory program, please describe: C why the regulation is needed; C the scope of, and procedures for, inspections or audits of regulated entities; C follow-up activities conducted when non-compliance is identified; C sanctions available to the agency to ensure compliance; and C procedures for handling consumer/public complaints against regulated entities.
For response to why the regulation is needed, see responses in Section I of this report.
For responses to the remaining questions, see response to Question F above.

Please fill in the following chart for each regulatory program.
The chart headings may be changed if needed to better reflect the agency's practices.
Texas State Board of Pharmacy (Regulatory Program) Exhibit 15: Complaints Against Regulated Entities or Persons Â­ Fiscal Years 2001 and 2002 FY 2001 FY 2002 1,787 2,090 see footnote (1) 181 see also footnote (2) see footnote (3) 225 days 2,581 26,529 see also footnote (4)
Number of jurisdictional complaints received Number of jurisdictional complaints resolved Number of complaints dropped/found to be without merit Number of sanctions (disciplinary orders) Number of complaints pending from prior years Average time period for resolution of a jurisdictional complaint Number of entities inspected or audited by the agency Total number of entities or persons regulated by the agency
1,642 1,614 see footnote (1) 145 see also footnote (2) see footnote (3) 267 days 2,529 26,282 see also footnote (4)
Footnote (1) Â­ TSBP interprets your definition of the term "dropped/found to be without merit" to mean complaints that are closed with an action other than a disciplinary order.
However, in TSBP's opinion, complaints that are closed without the entry of a disciplinary order are not considered "dropped" or "found to be without merit."
TSBP closes many complaints with non-disciplinary methods such as: verbal admonitions, written warnings, inspections and inspections with written warnings.
See representative examples below; the statistics below pertain to all complaints received by TSBP (including both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional complaints): FY2001 Complaints Closed Following a Verbal Admonition Complaints Closed Following a Written Warning Complaints Closed Following an Inspection Complaints Closed Following Entry of Disciplinary Order Complaints Closed Following an Investigation (due to insufficient evidence or no violation) Complaints Closed with No Action (due to no violation, insufficient information, etc.)
Complaints Closed with Other Type of Action (e.g., multiple actions; referrals, uncooperative complainants, complainants withdrew complaint, etc.)
Total Number of Complaints Closed (all complaints) 270 419 59 173 185 115 446 1,667 FY2002 483 456 25 211 379 90 493 2,137
-94-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
Footnote (2) Â­ The number of sanctions equals the number of disciplinary orders entered.
However, the number of sanctions does not equal the number of complaints closed with a disciplinary order.
Because one complaint may involve two licensees (i.e., one pharmacist and one pharmacy), one complaint may result in the entry of two disciplinary orders.
Moreover, one disciplinary order against one licensee may close one or more complaints.
Footnote (3) Â­ TSBP's computerized complaint tracking system allows the agency to query the number of active/pending complaints at the time of the query (i.e., the system does not have the ability for the agency to obtain the number of active/pending complaints for a date in the past).
However, TSBP can provide an estimate of the number of active/pending complaints during the last month in each of the requested fiscal years.
The estimate is based upon reports given to the Board at its meetings held in early August in 2001 and 2002.
These reports indicate the following statistics: C As of August 8, 2001 = 1,074 active/pending complaints C As of August 7, 2002 = 764 active/pending complaints Footnote (4) Â­ This total does not include the number of pharmacist-interns that are registered by TSBP.
The number of interns fluctuates each year from 1,300 to 1,800 persons.

A.
Agency Performance Evaluation What are the agency's most significant accomplishments?
The Texas State Board of Pharmacy (TSBP) has an excellent state and national reputation for its stature and effectiveness as a state health regulatory agency.
This reputation has been reinforced within Texas and throughout the nation, as evidenced by the following: (1) (2) (3) (4) an exception-free audit on the Post-Payment 
The final report stated in part, " . . .
The Texas State Board of Pharmacy is operating efficiently.
. . .
The agency actively seeks ways to determine how to improve its operations.
. . .
We commend the agency's personnel for their efforts to improve both agency operations and the practice of pharmacy throughout the State."
(5)
-95-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
The agency has also been an innovator in the field of proactive health regulation.
This recognition and stature is well-documented in that TSBP was the first or one of the first, pharmacy boards in the nation to: (1) (2) use ad hoc task forces in its pre-rule-making process (the agency began using these task forces in 1981); publish a Newsletter that is distributed to all licensees and other interested customers (the Newsletter has been continuously published since 1977 and is directed at educating pharmacists about the laws/rules relating to the practice of pharmacy; it also discloses the names of all pharmacists and pharmacies disciplined by the Board); implement a preventive enforcement program that encourages pharmacists' voluntary compliance with governing laws and rules, through a combination of routine inspections and education efforts (the Compliance program began in 1977); develop and implement a strategic plan (the first agency Strategic Plan was developed in 1986); work with the regulated community to pass legislation to establish drug therapy management and immunizations by pharmacists, establish procedures to implement confidential peer review committees, and obtain funding for implementation of a pharmacy technician registration program; establish a comprehensive and user-friendly Web site to improve services and accessibility to its customers.
The site contains consumer information, including procedures regarding the complaint process, new and ongoing licensing information, a reference site for pharmacy-related information, and important information regarding the agency's laws and rules.
Significant additions to the web site include: a license verification link that enables the public to verify the licensing and disciplinary status of TSBP licensees and a system that allows an individual to file a complaint online; and implement an online pharmacist license renewal program.

B.
Describe the internal process used to evaluate agency performance, including how often performance is formally evaluated and how the resulting information is used by the policymaking body, management, the public, and customers.
Several internal processes are used to evaluate agency performance, as described below: (1) Strategic Planning Process Â­ The Board updates its strategic plan every other year.
During this process, the Board and staff evaluate the progress that the agency has made towards its long-term goals.
Annual Goals and Objectives Â­ The agency uses a modified management by objective system to evaluate agency performance.
Using the agency goals set forth in the TSBP Strategic Plan, the Board establishes detailed annual goals and objectives for the Office of the Executive Director and each organizational Division.
See Attachment #E for list of FY2003 Goals and Objectives.
The executive management team (Executive -96-
(2)
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
Director and Division Directors) establishes management systems to determine progress toward annual goals/objectives and constantly monitors the progress made toward achieving these goals/objectives.
Some of the tools that the management team uses to determine progress include the following: (A) Reports on Output and Efficiency Performance Measures Â­ TSBP submits quarterly reports to the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) and Governor's Budget Office (GBO) regarding actual performance attained on Output and Efficiency Key Measures.
TSBP submits an annual report to LBB and GBO regarding actual performance on Output, Efficiency, Explanatory and Outcome Key Measures.
LBB/GBO and the agency use these reports to assess the performance of the agency against previously established performance targets; Executive Management Team Meetings Â­ The management team holds periodic meetings (approximately every four to six weeks) to review activities of the divisions and discuss the agency's progress toward annual goals; Manager's Monthly Status Reports Â­ Each one of the four Division Directors submits a monthly activity report to the Executive Director detailing division activities and progress made toward the annual goals of the division;
(B)
(C)
(3)
Annual Report of Goals and Objectives Â­ Following the end of each fiscal year, a comprehensive annual report is made to the Board detailing the agency's accomplishments and constraints in the prior fiscal year.
The Board uses this information to evaluate the performance of the Executive Director; the Executive Director uses this information to evaluate the performance of the Division Directors, and the Division Directors use this information to evaluate the performance of Division employees.
Performance evaluations of all employees are conducted annually.
Upon request, TSBP distributes copies of the agency's annual report to the public.
The agency's annual reports for the past two years are also posted on the TSBP Web site.
Customer Satisfaction Survey Â­ See response to Question F (below).
Internal Audit Â­ H.B.609, 77th Texas Legislature (2001), established the requirement for all state agencies to employ an Internal Auditor for the purpose of improving performance through identification/elimination of problems.
In FY2002, the agency contracted with an outside consultant-C.P.A. firm who used a risk assessment model to rank and prioritize the identified risks associated with various business activities.
Following their review of the Internal Audit plan, the TSBP Executive Committee determined that the agency's complaint process and computer security should be audited by the Internal Auditor, due to the high risk potential of these activities.
In FY2002, the Internal Auditor reviewed the agency's complaint process.
Statistical testing was employed to assess: adequacy of internal control over the complaint resolution process; content accuracy and sufficiency of complaint information file; timeliness of complainant notification; compliance with statutory requirements of the complaint resolution process; and compliance with statutory requirements of the disciplinary process.
The Internal Auditor determined that TSBP had been "successful in investigating and resolving complaints filed with the Board in conformity with the Texas Occupation Code and Texas Administrative Code" and had "established and followed a sound complaint record retention procedure."
However, one deficiency was identified.
Due to workload issues, the Enforcement Division was only in 85% compliance with -97-
(4) (5)
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
notifying complainants every four months of the status of their complaints.
Management instituted procedures to address the situation.
In FY2003, the Internal Auditor reviewed computer security, the licensing process and the complaint process and found no deficiencies.
Due to budget cutbacks in FY2004, the Internal Auditor function will be eliminated.
(6) Survey of Organizational Excellence Â­ Since 1994, TSBP has been participating in the biennial survey conducted by the University of Texas School of Social Work relating to organizational excellence.
This survey is sent to all agency employees and asks for their opinions about the total work environment.
The Executive Director encourages all employees to participate in the survey.
Responses are anonymous.
The Executive Director and Division Directors thoroughly read and review the report that is generated from the survey results, including the agency's strengths and areas that may need improvement.
The agency's scores rate consistently higher than the statewide average for all workplace dimensions.
Agency Change Team (ACT) Â­ To get agency staff more involved in reviewing and learning about the results of the Survey of Organizational Excellence, the Executive Director established the ACT committee in FY2003.
This committee was composed of front-line staff members (one from each section within the agency).
Committee members were asked to read the summary report regarding the agency's responses to surveys completed in FY2002.
After an initial meeting, ACT members had team meetings with fellow employees.
Following the team meetings, the ACT committee produced a 12-page report regarding 47 suggestions for changes to agency operations.
The final report was given to the Executive Director in February 2003.
The management team (Executive Director and Division Directors) held two meetings reviewing each suggestion listed in the ACT report (i.e., the management team spent approximately eight hours discussing the content of the ACT report).
On May 16, 2003, the management team produced a 9-page written response listing the 23 changes that had been implemented as a result of the ACT report (i.e., management implemented 49% of the total number of suggestions made by the ACT committee); if a suggestion was not implemented, management's written response explained the reasons why a change was not made.
(7)
C.
What are the agency's biggest opportunities for improvement?
With the recent budget cuts (7% for FY 2002 and 12.5% for the FY2004-2005 biennium) the agency is struggling to maintain its level of service.
In addition, during the next biennium, the agency will begin to register approximately 25,000 pharmacy technicians.
This number of registrants will double the agency''s number of registrants/licensees.
The agency is expected to accomplish this task with an increase in funding of approximately $200,000 over the funding for the last biennium.
Other opportunities for improvement also relate to the budget and to personnel issues.
With the existing structure, the agency is unable to adequately compensate its professional staff particularly the Executive Director.
In each of the last three Legislative Sessions, the agency has asked the legislature to increase the salary of the Executive Director of the agency.
This increase based on the following information:
-98-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
(1)
The person who is the executive director for the Board of Pharmacy is required not only to be a pharmacist, but also to be a person who has considerable experience in the management of an organization including strategic planning and budgeting, who is familiar with pharmacy and drug laws, and who is familiar with state and national issues affecting pharmacy practice.
The current salary of the Executive Director ($70,000) is below the Texas average salary of a pharmacist working in Texas.
2002 Market data indicates that in the subregion which includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, the average salaries are $76,900 for staff pharmacists and $82,000 for pharmacist managers.
The great majority of pharmacists working within the State of Texas, including those working for the Board of Pharmacy, are currently classified as Pharmacist III''s, with a salary range of $52,992 - $82,140.
The pharmacist positions that are within the Board of Pharmacy are a part of the succession planning for the Executive Director position.
With this in mind, how will the Board of Pharmacy be able to hire an Executive Director if a pharmacist has to take a pay cut to become Executive Director?
(2)
(3)
The other personnel issue relates to the agency''s high rate of turnover rate, especially in terms of its pharmacist staff.
Again in each of the last three legislative sessions the agency has asked for additional appropriations to fund merit increases for agency employees Without these additional appropriations, merit increases will not be available to all eligible employees.
Given the rising cost of employee benefits (i.e., insurance), no substantive cost of living increases to state employees, and inadequate merit funding, staff turnover is expected to increase within the agency unless additional compensation shortcomings are addressed.
Agency employee turnover increased from 15% in FY96-97 to 20% in FY98-99 and dropped to 18% for the FY00-01 biennium.
The pharmacist turnover rate for FY2001 was an alarming 53.33%.
This loss of pharmacist staff is especially disturbing since the pharmacist staff are a part of the secession for the Executive Director position, in that the Executive Director is statutorily required to be a pharmacist.
In addition, during the last four years, the agency lost its Director of Investigations, three of its four field investigators, and one in-house investigator.
These investigators had an average of 16.19 years of Pharmacy Board experience.
The reason for the high turnover rate in both the pharmacist and investigator job classes can be directly attributed to retirement, salary dissatisfaction, increased workload as a result of legislative initiatives, and lack of any intrinsic rewards.
Employees are continually asked to do more with less.
We expect that employee turnover will continue to be volatile and increase, unless additional compensation shortcomings are addressed.
D.
How does the agency ensure its functions do not duplicate those of other entities?
TSBP has taken a "lead agency" role in coordinating enforcement activities of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, with regard to the regulation of pharmacies and pharmacists.
By keeping the lines of communication open between the various law enforcement agencies, by coordinating investigations involving pharmacies and pharmacists, by providing technical -99-
Texas State Board of Pharmacy Self-Evaluation Report
assistance to law enforcement officials and prosecutors, and by periodically meeting with the other entities, the agency has been able to develop a close working relationship with these agencies.
This process, in turn, has fostered and promoted a cooperative regulatory environment, resulting in virtual elimination of duplication of efforts.
E. No.
Are there any other entities that could perform any of the agency's functions?
F.
What process does the agency use to determine customer satisfaction and how does the agency use this information?
In FY2000 and FY2002, TSBP conducted a survey of agency customers regarding the quality of service delivered by the agency as specified in Chapter 2113 of the Government Code.
The TSBP Executive Director read all written comments and suggestions that customers made on the surveys.
Supervisors were advised if customers made comments about an employee and identified the employee by name; supervisors complimented specific employees when comments about them were positive, and counseled when comments were negative.
In FY2002, the Enforcement Division Director read all comments made on customer service surveys, identified the comments that could be described as a "suggestion," and prepared a summary list of the suggestions for review and consideration/action by agency staff.
See Attachment #K for a copy of the report that was submitted to the Board Members, Governor and Legislative Budget Board in FY2002, including the summary list of suggestions.
At the time of report, agency staff had accomplished eight of the suggestions and taken action on four others.
The suggestions made by the other 20 individuals were not acted upon due to the following reasons: funding not available (three suggestions from six individuals); statutory changes would be required (seven suggestions from eight individuals); suggestions not within TSBP's jurisdiction (four suggestions); and suggestions not in line with TSBP's mission (two suggestions).
G.
Describe the agency's process for handling complaints against the agency, including the maintenance of complaint files and procedures for keeping parties informed about the process.
If the agency has a division or office, such as an ombudsman, for tracking and resolving complaints from the public or other entities, please provide a description.
TSBP Rule 311.1 sets forth the procedures for handling complaints filed against a board employee.
See Attachment #B.
The TSBP Executive Director handles all written complaints against employees.
The executive assistant to the Executive Director is the TSBP Customer Relations Representative and maintains files for the Executive Director.
As indicated in the response to Question H (below), the agency did not have any written complaints filed against it or an employee in FY2001 or FY2002.
-100-

Otherwise, TSBP requests that the caller submit his/her request in writing.
TSBP accepts/processes requests for licensure information by email, telephone, fax, or U.S. mail.
(3)
Requests for Information about Disciplinary Orders The public can verify whether a licensee or intern has been the subject of a disciplinary order by going to the TSBP Web site and clicking on "License 
The detailed information will indicate whether the licensee or intern has been the subject of a disciplinary order.
(A) Public Disciplinary Orders Â­ If the Web site indicates "yes" (that the licensee or intern has been the subject of a disciplinary order), the public can call the TSBP office and speak with Regulatory Program staff regarding the details about the order (e.g., description of violations or alleged violations and description of sanction), provided the order is a public disciplinary order.
A copy of the public disciplinary order is provided upon written request.
The written request may be emailed or faxed to TSBP.
Confidential Disciplinary Orders Â­ Information about confidential disciplinary orders is restricted, pursuant to Section 564.002 of the Texas Pharmacy Act.
In accordance with Section 564.003(a), TSBP may provide a copy of the confidential order (or disclose information about the order) only to another state board of pharmacy, in a disciplinary hearing before the board or in a subsequent trial or appeal of a board action or order, or under a court order.
However, TSBP may and does disclose the status of the license if the confidential order revokes, cancels, restricts, or retires, or in any other manner limits the licensee's practice of pharmacy.
(B)
(4)
