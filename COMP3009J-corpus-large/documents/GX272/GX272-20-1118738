Abstract Sumter County (County) is proposing an innovative recycling project using advanced municipal solid waste (MSW) composting technology to recycle two nontraditional materials universally present in the MSW stream in substantial quantities-Undeliverable Bulk Business Mail (UBBM) and small domestic animal remains.
Sumter County will conduct the project at its new state -the-art Solid Waste Facility -of in partnership with the United States Postal Service (USPS) and the Sumter County Animal Control Department.
The Sumter County Solid Waste Facility has the only operating MSW digester in Florida and is the only site that can offer the State the opportunity to evaluate these and other innovative solutions to recycling and composting problems.
The major element of the project expands existing UBBM recycling options and demonstrates the benefits of UBBM composting.
Participating USPS post offices in four communities in two counties will recover UBBM and back -haul the material to the Zephyrhills post office, a central mail distribution center for the area.
The County will collect recovered UBBM, transport the material to the Solid Waste Facility, and load UBBM directly into the County's in -vessel compost digester system without additional sorting or pre -processing.
The UBBM -content compost will be monitored and tested throughout processing to ensure quality.
When the compost is finished and screened, up to 500 cubic yards of UBBM -content compost will be made available to the USPS for landscaping and soil amendment applications.
The second element of the project involves recovering small domestic animal remains, a nontraditional material universally present in the waste stream that is not currently being recycled.
he remains of animals euthanized by the Sumter County Animal Control Department will be loaded directly into the in-vessel compost digester without pre -processing.
In the compost digester, the aerobic process pasteurizes the material, eliminating the risk of potential soil or groundwater contamination, and produces a beneficial compost product.
Because this is a nontraditional material that has not previously been recovered as compost, the proposed project includes a lab center and compost testing equipment to monitor and test the material regularly throughout processing to ensure safety and quality.
The County will establish operating procedures for handling and composting the material prepared in a form suitable for dissemination to other solid waste departments and animal control agencies.
To realize the long-term value of this project, the County proposes four education activities designed al to promote composting, and facilitate recovery of nontraditional materials, and increase recycling rates.
Sumter County will disseminate information about the project in the form of an educational brochure, a PC-compatible diskette, an educational video for general audiences and students, and a workshop for solid waste managers, recyclers, and composters.
These materials are extremely promising targets for recycling because they are universally present, easily accessible, and source separated by generators.
Since UBBM constitutes up to 90% of the USPS waste stream, this project has enormous implications and could spark the rapid development of UBBM composting programs throughout the United States.
The USPS is committed to UBBM recycling and supports this project.

Project Description Sumter County (County) is proposing an innovative recycling project using advanced technology to recycle nontraditional materials that have historically presented substantial obstacles to traditional recycling methods and operations.
The proposed project will be conducted by Sumter County at its newly-constructed Solid Waste Facility, a state -the-art integrated recycling and composting facility -of that combines a front-end materials recovery facility with an in -vessel compost digester system.
The Sumter County Solid Waste Facility has the only operating municipal solid waste (MSW) digester in Florida and is the only site that can offer the State the opportunity to evaluate these and other innovative solutions to recycling and composting problems.
The proposed project will make an important contribution to Florida recycling practices by expanding MSW recycling operations to include two nontraditional materials that are universally present but currently not being recovered by traditional recycling technologies.
This project represents a regional approach to developing innovative recycling solutions.
The project is an individual County project, but the largest element of the project will be carried out by the County in partnership with the United States Postal Service (USPS) with the participation of USPS service facilities located in five separate communities in Hillsborough and Pasco Counties.
The project will demonstrate the environmental and economic benefits of recycling two nontraditional materials.
The major element of the project entails the recovery of Undeliverable Bulk Business Mail (UBBM) through composting to produce Class A compost.
The second element of the project will demonstrate the benefits of recovering small domestic animal remains from the municipal solid waste stream, and the third element will disseminate information about the project and its results.
The three elements of the project are described in more detail in the following subsections.
Element #1: Composting Undeliverable Bulk Business Mail The major element of the project expands existing UBBM recycling options and demonstrates the benefits of UBBM composting.
(See Section3, Advanced Technologies or Processes,for a detailed discussion of existing recycling options.).
The County proposes to collect UBBM generated by post offices located in Zephyrhills, Dade City, Land O'Lakes, Lutz, and Odessa, Florida.
Participating USPS service facilities will recover UBBM and back -haul the material to the Zephyrhills Post Office, a central mail processing plant for the area.
Sumter County will collect the material at the Zephyrhills Post Office and transport it to the County's Solid Waste Facility where the material will be loaded directly into the County's enclosed compost digester without additional sorting or processing.
Following initial processing in the digester, partially composted material will be transferred to a finishing area for final "curing" and finishing.
The UBBM project is designed to take full advantage of existing USPS infrastructure and resources.
Specifically, the Zephyrhills facility is a central processing plant that processes mail SC21/InnGrant. doc

Project Description (con't) coming into the area and distributes it to local post offices in Dade City, Land O'Lakes, Lutz, and Odessa for final sorting and delivery to recipients.
Each day, USPS mail trucks are loaded at the Zephyrhills facility, transport mail to the four post offices, and return empty to the Zephyrhills plant.
This in-place transportation system offers a cost -effective and efficient means for "back -hauling" UBBM to the Zephyrhills plant for collection and processing.
(See Section 5, Cost Effectiveness, for a detailed cost analysis of this project element.)
To implement UBBM recycling, each participating USPS facility will be provided with covered, wheeled containers suitable for storing recovered UBBM.
As part of daily operations, USPS staff will deposit recovered UBBM in these containers, and filled containers will be loaded onto empty USPS trucks returning to the Zephyrhills plant.
At the Zephyrhills plant, containers will be removed from trucks and emptied into covered roll containers for temporary storage.
Empty wheeled containers -off will be returned to participating USPS facilities via outgoing mail trucks from the Zephyrhills facility.
As frequently as necessary, Sumter County will collect roll containers and transport the material to -off the Sumter County Solid Waste Facility.
At the facility, the material will be unloaded directly from roll off containers by means of a front -loader into an in-feed hopper and onto a direct -feed conveyor for input into the County's compost digester without further processing or sorting.
Processed MSW will also be added to the digester, along with the appropriate quantities of nitrogen source material and water required to support the aerobic composting process.
Oxygen levels, temperature readings, and moisture content will be monitored and adjusted throughout the process to ensure optimal conditions for decomposition.
A lab center and compost testing equipment is included in the project to support testing activities scheduled throughout the compost production process.
After processing in the digester for approximately three days, partially composted material is discharged, screened, and deposited in windrows in the compost finishing area, an enclosed area where compost is protected from exposure to weather and excessive moisture.
In the finishing area, turning machines periodically agitate and aerate the compost to complete the composting process and produce the best quality compost.
After finishing, compost will undergo a final screening before distribution for standard composting applications.
As part of the project, Sumter County will provide the USPS with up to 500 cubic yards of UBBM-content compost for use in landscaping and soil amen dment applications.
The County will also cooperate with the USPS to develop procurement specifications for UBBM -content compost to facilitate procurement and expand markets for the product.
This portion of the project is particularly important to the long-term transferability of this element of the project since the USPS is committed to developing "closed-loop" recycling programs for UBBM.
(See Section Technology Transfer,for a 4, more detailed discussion of the project's transferability.)
Element #2: Composting Small Domestic Animal Remains The second element of the proposed project involves recovering small domestic animal remains, a nontraditional material universally present in the MSW stream that is not currently being SC21/InnGrant. doc

Project Description (con't) recycled.
Historically, disposal options for animal remains have been limited to incineration and burial.
Florida regulations [Section 823.041(1), F.S.] require animal owners and custodians to dispose of the carcasses of diseased animals by burning or burial at least two (2) feet below the surface but impose no restrictions on public disposal technologies.
Regulations do not require that these remains be disposed of in Class I landfills or in lined excavations to eliminate the risk of ground water contamination.
Further, regulations do not address the disposal of healthy, humanely euthanized animals.
(See Section 3,Advanced Technologies or Processesfor a discussion of current practices.)
The County proposes to demonstrate the advantages of in -vessel composting to recover a beneficial product from this material.
The County's Animal Control Department is located adjacent to the County Solid Waste Facility.
Received or impounded small domestic animals that are not claimed or adopted are routinely euthanized at the Animal Control facility.
During the proposed project, animal remains will be transported to the Solid Waste Facility by means of a front -loader, loaded into an in -feed hopper, and input into the compost digester by a direct -feed conveyor.
Processed MSW will also be added to the digester, along with the appropriate quantities of nitrogen source material and water required to support the aerobic composting process.
In the compost digester, the aerobic process pasteurizes the material, eliminating the risk of potential soil or groundwater contamination, and produces a beneficial compost product.
(See Section Cost 5, Effectiveness, for a discussion of the economic benefits associated with the proposed innovative technology.)
After processing in the digester for approximately three days, the partially composted material will be discharged and handled following the procedures described in Element #1: Composting Undeliverable Bulk Business Mailbefore being distributed for use in Sumter County public works projects.
Because this is a nontraditional material that has not previously been recovered as compost, the proposed project includes a lab center and compost testing equipment to monitor and test the material regularly throughout processing to ensure that optimal oxygen, nitrogen, and moisture levels are maintained.
Compost produced using this material will be inspected and carefully evaluated to document the quality of the finished compost product and its suitability for standard applications.
The project will establish operating procedures for handling and composting the material prepared in a form suitable for dissemination to other solid waste managers and animal control agencies in Florida.
(See Section 4, Technology Transfer,for a discussion of the transferability of the project's innovative technology.)
Element #3: Public Education and Information Dissemination Sumter County is proud of its new Solid Waste Facility and is confident that this project will make an important contribution to MSW recycling operations in Florida.
To realize the potential long -term value of this project, Sumter County is prepared to commit substantial efforts to public education and information dissemination.
The Sumter County Solid Waste Facility attracts large numbers of visitors each year and hosts tours by state, regional, national, and international

Project Description (con't) recycling groups.
The facility is recognized for its state -the art technology, and it serves as an -of appropriate site for promoting innovative technologies.
In addition to making one formal presentation about the project at an appropriate state or national workshop within one year following completion of the project, the County proposes four additional educational activities designed to promote composting and facilitate recovery of materials not presently being recovered from the MSW stream.
The following subsections describe the public education and information dissemination activities the County proposes in connection with this innovative recycling project.
Educational Brochure: Sumter County will develop and produce an educational brochure describing MSW recycling and composting operations at the Sumter County Solid Waste Facility for distribution to visitors to the facility and by mail to other Florida solid waste departments.
The brochure will particularly focus on expanding MSW composting to nontraditional materials and will include a description of the County's UBBM and small domestic animal remains projects.
Educational Diskette: Sumter County will develop and produce a PC -compatible diskette presenting information about MSW recycling and composting.
Information will include lessons learned from the County's more than ten years experience with MSW composting, documentation of the benefits of MSW composting, and guidelines for MSW compost marketing.
The diskette will be available on request at no charge.
Educational Video: Sumter County will develop and produce an educational video suitable for general audiences and students.
The video will explain MSW composting, describe the benefits of this technology, and promote the use of MSW compost as a high quality soil amendment.
The video will be used to supplement visitors' tours of the facility and will be available to community groups and schools for educational and classroom use at no charge.
Educational Workshop: In cooperation with the Florida Organics Recyclers Association, Sumter County will conduct an educational workshop for municipal and private solid waste managers, recyclers, and composters at the Solid Waste Facility.
The workshop will include a tour of the facility, a presentation on MSW composting, and a discussion of composting nontraditional materials to increase recycling rates.

Advanced Technologies or Processes Currently, the USPS is energetically promoting UBBM recycling to capitalize on the economic, environmental, and customer satisfaction benefits associated with recovering this material.
The USPS is particularly interested in developing "closed -loop" recycling programs that produce UBBM -content products the Postal Service can use in routine operations.
While recovery and collection of UBBM is relatively easy to accomplish by using existing USPS fleet transportation systems to "back -haul" material to a central location, the USPS has had difficulty finding markets for recovered UBBM.
The lack of markets has curtailed recycling efforts, and large quantities of UBBM presently enter the MSW stream for disposal.
If adequate recycling markets were available, the USPS could recover virtually all of this material.
UBBM presents problems for conventional recycling technologies.
The material, if it is recognized as recyclable, is classified as "low -grade mixed paper" in commodity markets.
Unlike other mixed paper, contamination from adhesives [also known as pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) or "stickles"], window envelopes, and glossy paper renders UBBM unacceptable for conventional paper recycling operations, which require more homogeneous feedstocks.
Even though the USPS has been able to find limited recovery partners in Chicago and Atlanta, large metropolitan areas with established, specialized recycled paper mills, UBBM quantities far exceed the recycled paper industry's capacity.
Low market values and high transportation costs prohibit widespread UBBM recycling.
In an aggressive effort to develop recycling alternatives for UBBM, the USPS has developed innovative projects with Gridcore, Inc. of Long Beach, California to manufacture UBBM -content recycling containers for post offices, with J. R. Moon Pencil Co., in Lewisburg, Tennessee to manufacture pencils that contain 25% recycled UBBM, and with Pure Vision Technologies in Denver, Colorado to examine the feasibility of transforming UBBM into ethanol.
While these projects demonstrate alternate uses for recovered UBBM, none of these technologies have proved economically viable for processing available large quantities of UBBM.
In January 1997, the USPS funded an innovative composting pilot project by Texas A 
The project, the first of its kind in the country, composted shredded UBBM in an outdoor windrow along with yard trimmings, liquid wastes, grocery and food processing residues, and approximately 250 cubic yards of wood chips.
The compost, which took four months to produce, is now being tested in horticultural applications by Texas A 
In comparison to the Texas pilot project, the potential impact of the County's project is enormous.
The County's project can potentially create a virtually unlimited market for UBBM in Florida and nationally.
Relying on its extensive experience with MSW composting and its state -the-art -of composting technology, the County proposes to demonstrate the viability of using UBBM feedstock in MSW composting, an innovative but accessible technology with the capacity to recycle large quantities of UBBM to produce a valuable marketable product with many marketing options.
Compared with traditional paper recycling options, composting technology is readily available, relatively inexpensive, SC21/InnGrant.doc

Advanced Technologies or Processes (con't) and capable of providing a stable demand for large quantities of UBBM.
The Sumter County project alone could potentially more than double the quantities of UBBM being recovered and could recycle virtually 100% of the UBBM being generated by the Zephyrhills service area.
The Zephyrhills Post Office presently generates approximately 14 tons per month of material, and the Lutz Post Office generates approximately 7 tons per month.
(Under current service arrangements, the USPS has no assurance that this material is being recycled since local commercial recyclers who collect UBBM may dispose of the material if a market is not available.)
UBBM is not currently being recovered at the Dade City, Odessa, and Land O'Lakes facilities.
The second element of the County's project also involves a material that is not currently being recycled.
While no State-wide or national data is available, the County has found no information that suggests that small domestic animals remains are being recycled for beneficial use in any county in Florida.
Prevalent disposal technologies, burial and burning, present potential difficulties, result in adverse environmental impacts, and produce no beneficial products.
(See Section 5, Cost Effectiveness, for the discussion of the economic benefits of recycling this material.)
Understandably, the nature of this material tends to discourage public discussion of current disposal practices and community involvement in planning for material management.
Inside the solid waste industry, the material is rarely discussed.
Consequently, animal control agencies and solid waste planners have had little incentive to develop alternative technologies.
The project proposed by the County will demonstrate the benefits of composting this material and will develop material handling procedures and composting guidelines for use by other counties.
A preliminary project survey indicates that the five counties in the Sumter County area use either incineration or landfill disposal for managing small domestic animal remains.
Those counties that burn animal remains transport ashes to local landfills or to waste -energy facilities for disposal.
Counties -to that do not operate crematories, transport remains directly to landfills for disposal.
None of the counties surveyed recover any beneficial use from the material.
Many small counties in Florida, like Sumter County, do not operate landfills and do not generate sufficient quantities of the material to justify incineration equipment.
Counties that do not operate landfills or crematories must dispose of animal remains by burial, a disposal method that produces no beneficial products, presents material handling problems, and poses potential risks associated with disposal in unlined excavations.
For large counties that generate substantial quantities of material, composting offers the opportunity to divert material from landfills, eliminate landfill or waste-to-energy tip fees, and produce a beneficial product.
The County's project presents unique opportunities to increase Florida's MSW recycling rates by recovering two organic materials that are not currently being recovered.
Composting technology is ideally suited to both UBBM and small domestic animal remains.

Technology Transfer Six days a week, 52 weeks a year the USPS delivers mail to virtually every person in the country through a well-developed infrastructure.
The USPS handles over 180 billion pieces of mail each year, and nearly 40% of that volume is business -generated correspondence, magazines, and advertising that the USPS calls Bulk Business Mail (BBM.)
Since BBM is typically mailed at third class rates, it is not forwarded or returned to the sender when it cannot be delivered to addressees, and postal facilities must properly dispose of thousands of tons of UBBM each year.
Since the USPS estimates that UBBM makes up 70% to 90% of the agency's waste stream, UBBM recycling offers the opportunity to approach a zero disposal rate.
Every USPS mail facility in Florida, from the smallest neighborhood post office to regional mail distribution centers at major international airports in large metropolitan areas, generates UBBM.
Central Forwarding Facilities, specialized processing centers that handle mail forwarding services for other postal locations, are particularly large UBBM generators.
UBBM generation rates are especially high in Florida because of the State's seasonal population.
While first class mail is forwarded to temporary residents when they return to their permanent residences, UBBM is not, and UBBM generation rates soar during Florida's off -seasons.
Even small Florida communities experience several times their usual generation rates when winter residents return north.
Fluctuating generation rates place additional strain on already limited paper recycling markets and make it more difficult for recyclers to market the material.
Similarly, every community in Florida faces the challenge of managing small domestic animal remains.
In addition to animals that either die or are euthanized under the care of privately practicing veterinarians, animal control agencies euthanize thousands of animals in Florida each day.
Even small counties like Sumter County, must dispose of one to two hundred carcasses a month and one to two thousand carcasses every year, and this rate is increasing.
Although data is not available on a statewide basis, preliminary project surveys indicate that larger communities dispose of hundreds of dead animals per week and tens of thousands each year.
Thus, every community in Florida can take advantage of the innovative recycling technology proposed by the County.
The technology demonstrated by the County's proposed project is highly transferable and easily adapted to existing MSW and yard waste composting operations.
The County's project will demonstrate that both UBBM and small domestic animal remains are suitable feedstocks for existing in-vessel composting systems.
With relatively limited modifications to accommodate direct -feed of in these materials without additional processing, existing in -vessel composting systems can create markets for UBBM.
In addition, the Texas A 
Thus, UBBM could be introduced as a desirable carbon source to improve the quality of the compost being produced by Florida's numerous existing yard waste composting facilities.
UBBM composting is also an attractive alternative for communities where composting technology is not presently in use.
Composting technology is relatively inexpensive to acquire and operate and is especially
SC21/InnGrant.doc
SUMTER COUNTY TIN 59-6000865 RFP NO. 9808C INNO VA TI VE RECYCLING PROJECTS ___________________________________________________________________________________________
flexible in design and capacity.
Windrow composting systems can be adapted for backyard, institutional, or municipal settings and can be designed to process from a few cubic yards a week to hundreds of tons per day.
Thus, municipal and private -sector UBBM composting operations can be developed in proximity to UBBM sources and can be designed to accommodate available UBBM supplies.
While small domestic animal remains are biologically suitable for windrow composting, aesthetic considerations make in -vessel composting more appropriate for this material.
In -vessel composting technology is also extremely flexible, widely available, and relatively inexpensive to own and operate.
Commercially available in -vessel systems range in capacity from two or three cubic yards to sixty tons per day.
Small three- to five-cubic-yard capacity in-vessel digester systems can be purchase for as d little as $5,000 to $6,000.
These small, commercially -available in-vessel composting systems offer an attractive alternative to conventional MSW disposal methods.
These systems are available in a modular design that can be easily expanded.
With a modest initial investment, municipalities and counties with limited resources can implement a composting system to manage animal remains in a safe, economical, and environmentally sound way.
Both of these nontraditional materials are universally present in significant quantities throughout Florida, and both are relatively easy to segregate and cost -effective to collect.
Particularly in the case of UBBM, the USPS is highly motivated to recover the material and offers an in -place transportation system to haul the material to central locations for collection.
Because of the nature of the material, small domestic animal remains are generated and managed at centralized locations and are source separated for processing.
On the material supply side, all the circumstances necessary to implement a successful recycling program for these materials are present.
The County's innovative project provides the necessary technology to create a stable, accessible, and expandable process for recovering these materials for beneficial use.
Obviously, public education and information dissemination is crucial to implementing recycling programs for these two nontraditional materials.
Other Florida communities and private sector recyclers must be informed of the availability of the materials for recovery, the accessibility of the technology for processing the materials, and the economic viability of the proposed recycling programs.
To accomplish this important objective, the County's project includes a substantial public education and information dissemination component in addition to the presentation required by the project.
(See Section 2, Project Description, for a description of this element of the project.)
By providing information about the County's project in a variety of formats and widely distributing this information, the County will facilitate the development of similar programs.
The potential for expanding UBBM recycling is particularly promising.
In addition to municipal UBBM composting programs like the County's project, UBBM composting offers private sector recyclers unique opportunities for developing projects in partnership with the USPS.
Sumter County is proud of its state-of-the-art recycling and composting facility and is convinced that the County's inno vative technology will serve as a model for other Florida communities.

Cost Effectiveness The County's project will demonstrate that composting is an economically viable and cost effective alternative to existing recycling and disposal options for both UBBM and small domestic animal remains.
Over 80% of the project budget is earmarked for recycling infrastructure with a useful life of 10 to 15 years.
This infrastructure will allow the County to not only to continue to recycle the two nontraditional materials included in this project but also to expand MSW composting in the future to other nontraditional materials that can be direct -fed into the County's digester.
Thus, while the costs of the project will be substantially recovered in the next few years, the project will produce benefits for many years to come.
Because neither UBBM nor small domestic animal remains is currently being recycled, statewide average recycling costs are not available.
Currently, UBBM recycling is extremely limited, and UBBM that is not separately recovered is collected and disposed of as Class I solid waste.
A preliminary project survey indicates that small domestic animal remains are not presently being recovered for beneficial use.
Thus, a portion of project costs will be recovered through avoidance of $50 to $70 per ton disposal costs and production of a beneficial product with a market value of approximately $20 per ton.
Under existing recycling service arrangements, recovered UBBM is collected at individual USPS service locations by local recyclers.
These local recyclers may be able to market limited amounts of UBBM by tying the material to more desirable commodities such as OCC or ONP.
This marketing strategy devalues higher quality commodities and creates market problems by forcing acceptance of UBBM.
End-users forced to accept UBBM in order to get better products eventually dispose of large quantities of unusable UBBM at landfills.
Even if recyclers can market limited quantities of UBBM by combining UBBM with more valuable commodities, they would be unable to market the quantity of material that would be generated by a fully -committed UBBM recycling program.
In addition to limiting the quantity of UBBM that can be recovered, current recycling arrangements impose other limitations.
Because UBBM is difficult to market to traditional recycled paper markets, local recyclers must charge the USPS premium rates for collecting, transporting and marketing or disposing of the material if unmarketable.
Under these arrangements, the USPS has no opportunity to offset transportation costs by taking advantage of USPS truck fleets to back -haul material to a central collection site.
Moreover, once UBBM is collected by local recyclers, the USPS has no guarantee that it will not be disposed of if unmarketable and no opportunity to procure UBBM -content products.
Project participants that currently recycle pay a minimum of $30 per ton plus $100 per pickup for recycling service.
The County anticipates that UBBM composting can reduce those costs by more than half.
The proposed UBBM project will improve cost -effectiveness in four ways: * * Reducing transportation and handling costs Eliminating preprocessing expenses

Cost Effectiveness (con't) * * Producing a valuable UBBM -content end-product Reducing undesirable environmental impacts
The County's project will improve cost effectiveness by reducing transportation and handling costs in several ways.
First, by using empty USPS trucks to back -haul material to a central collection site, the project eliminates a substantial portion of transportation costs for collection.
Second, by collecting the material in roll-off containers at a central location, the project maximizes economies of scale and reduces material handling costs.
Finally, the project eliminates marketing costs by processing the material locally rather than transporting it long distances to major recycled paper markets with the hope that some portion may be recyclable.
The County's project also eliminates the need for expensive pre -processing.
Recovered UBBM be loaded directly from roll-off storage into the County's compost digester witho additional sorting or ut pre-processing.
Unlike the recycled paper manufacturing process, this innovative composting technology eliminates the need to sort, compact, bale, wash, bleach, chemically treat, or otherwise pre-process the material to prepare it for recycling.
The County's project will produce a viable UBBM -content end product suitable for procurement by the USPS.
The County has been producing MSW compost for more than ten years and during that time has used MSW compost in a variety of landscaping and public works applications.
Based on this extensive experience, the County anticipates that the use of MSW compost will result in substantial savings and produce superior results compared with top soil and other soil amendments.
In the case of small domestic animal remains, the County's project is expected to improve cost effectiveness by reducing labor costs for material handling and by producing a valuable end product from material that is not presently being recovered.
(Communities where the material or ash residue are landfilled could expect to achieve additional substantial savings from disposal cost avoidance.)
Finally, for every ton of UBBM that is back -hauled and every ton of animal remains that are composted, environmental impacts are reduced.
Composting these materials conserves valuable resources by reducing fuel, tire, and vehicle consumption and decreasing wear on roads highways.
Composting reduces energy consumption in processing and diverts material from landfills.
Moreover, "closed-loop" recycling continues to be one of the most environmentally desirable recycling options.
While composting these materials is a cost -effective alternative for Sumter County, the long- term benefit of the project is its greater value as a demonstration for other Florida communities.
The County's project will demonstrate that composting is an economically viable, environmentally sound alternative to traditional recycling technology that can help Florida increase recycling rates by expanding MSW and yard waste composting to include these and other nontraditional materials SC21/InnGrant.doc

Nontraditional Materials The County proposes to collect and recycle two nontraditional materials, UBBM and small domestic animal remains.
Both materials satisfy the definition of MSW specified in Section 403.706(5), F.S., which includes "any solid waste, except for sludge, resulting from the operation of residential, commercial, governmental, or institutional establishments that would normally be collected, processed, and disposed of through a public or private solid waste management service."
Both UBBM and small domestic animal remains are generated by government agencies (the USPS and Sumter County Animal Control, respectively) and are normally disposed of as solid waste.
UBBM is an attractive target material for innovative recycling technologies.
By definition, UBBM is a unique material generated in large quantities by USPS mail facilities throughout Florida and the United States.
UBBM, which constitutes up to 90% of the agency's waste stream, is segregated from other mail and solid waste as part of normal USPS operations, and, thus, the material is relatively easy to recover at its source.
Because of the material's high generation rates and ease of separation, the USPS is highly motivated to recover the material.
To facilitate UBBM recycling, the USPS is willing to use its in -place transportation system to back -haul material to USPS mail processing centers for centralized collection.
In addition, the USPS also promotes "closed -loop" recycling and would support end market development by procuring UBBM -content products.
UBBM, which is generally classified as "low -grade mixed paper" in commodity markets, contains high levels of contaminants such as adhesive, window envelops, and glossy papers that render the material unsuitable for conventional paper recycling technologies.
Consequently, traditional paper markets are not available to process the quantities of UBBM that can potentially be recovered.
Until an innovative technology is developed to provide a stable and expandable market for UBBM, the material can not be recycled.
Small domestic animal remains constitute a material present in Florida's MSW stream that is not currently being recycled.
Like UBBM, this material is unique and is generated solely by privately practicing veterinarians and government or quasi -governmental agencies.
It is segregated at its source and can be easily diverted from the MSW stream.
The most prevalent current disposal methods are burning and burial, neither of which permits beneficial use of the material.
Because animal remains present potential human health risks and unique aesthetic considerations, this material is not suitable for traditional recycling technologies.
At the same time, the nature of the material tends to discourage public discussion of material management options, and solid waste managers and animal control agencies have had little incentive to develop alternative technologies.

Nontraditional Materials (con't) expandable processing market for virtually unlimited quantities of UBBM.
In -vessel composting systems, which are available in a wide range of capacities, are an aesthetically and biologically acceptable recycling option for recycling animal remains.
While yard waste composting and mulching operations have proliferated in Florida since landfill disposal was prohibited and yard waste composting was deregulated, MSW composting remains an advanced technology.
Composting is an increasingly attractive alternative given Florida's projected stagnating diversion rates.
Now that the State has achieved a 37% recycling rate, the rate of increase has leveled and is not expected to keep pace with steadily increasing generation rates and population growth.
In these circumstances, organic fractions are a promising target for recyclers.
Organics account for over 50% of Florida's MSW stream, and paper alone makes up nearly 30%.
Even disregarding OCC, NOP, and office paper, other lower grades of paper make up over 10% of Florida's MSW stream.
Thus, in addition to providing a stable market for UBBM and small animal remains, the project's technology offers an attractive innovative alternative for recovering materials with limited recycling options.
The project's UBBM collection system also represents a nontraditional approach to recycling.
By taking advantage of existing USPS infrastructure, the County is able to dramatically improve cost effectiveness and reduce recycling costs.
By reducing recycling costs below disposal costs, the project creates the necessary economic incentives for generators to increase recovery rates to achieve virtually 100% recovery of available material.
The County's regional approach is another nontraditional feature.
This project represents an innovative partnership between a federal agency, a local animal control department, and a county solid waste facility to provide service at sites in six separate communities in three counties.
The project is exceptionally flexible and can be easily expanded to incorporated additional USPS facilities located in the area.
In sum, the County's project involves the recovery of two nontraditional materials by means of an innovative composting technology.
The project's potential benefits are enormous.
This project can serve as a useful demonstration of the advantages of MSW and yard waste composting and a valuable lesson in how recycling rates can be substantially increased by expanding MSW and yard waste composting to nontraditional materials.
While UBBM and small domestic animal remains were selected for this project because of their easy accessibility and high generation rates, the project's innovative technology is directly applicable to other organic fractions in Florida's MSW stream.
This project's innovative technology is highly transferable, easily adapted to other nontraditional materials, and flexible enough to suit a variety of applications and contexts.
Small rural counties and large metropolitan areas will benefit from the project's exciting results and impressive potential for increasing recycling rates.

Regional Programs The County's project represents a regional approach to developing innovative recycling solutions.
The project will be carried out by Sumter County in partnership with five USPS facilities located in five separate communities in Pasco and Hillsborough Counties.
The County's regional approach to this project is particularly important since in many locations throughout Florida a regional approach will be essential to implementing UBBM recycling programs The County's proposed UBBM recycling project is an important prototype for future UBBM recycling programs.
Because of the material's low market value, successful UBBM recycling depends upon taking advantage of the existing USPS infrastructure to maximize recovery rates and reduce collection costs.
At the same time, since the mail delivery system is based on population distribution rather than political boundaries, USPS organizational structures are not congruent with municipal recycling programs.
As a result, UBBM recycling may not be easily implemented through municipal recycling programs.
In order to develop the proposed project, the County first had to identify relevant USPS operational structures and enlist the interest of appropriate USPS management staff.
The USPS is organized into districts which typically span several counties.
For example, the Suncoast District on Florida's west coast stretches from Collier county north to Sumter County.
Each district includes distribution centers that receive and process mail for area post offices.
The Suncoast District includes distribution centers located in Ft. Myers, Bradenton (Manasota), Tampa, Lakeland, and Zephyrhills.
The Zephyrhills facility processes and distributes mail to the post offices in Dade City, Land O'Lakes, and Odessa in Pasco county and Lutz in Hillsborough County.
These distribution centers are pivotal to the success of UBBM recycling since they can serve as centralized collection sites for material being back -hauled from local post offices in the area.
UBBM recycling programs begin with the participation of USPS distribution centers but also depend upon the support of local post offices served by those centers.
While district environmental compliance coordinators have responsibility for identifying objectives and facilitating recycling activities throughout the district, local post masters retain considerable autonomy and have primary responsibility for implementing recycling programs for their facilities.
Thus, development of a fully-committed UBBM program depends upon the voluntary cooperation of individual post masters and requires considerable coordination among participating facilities.
The project's potential benefits are enormous.
The County's project, which crosses political boundaries to accommodate existing USPS infrastructure, demonstrates the regional approach that will be necessary if the USPS is to achieve its UBBM recycling goals.
The County's project will serve as an important model for Florida communities seeking to expand existing programs.
More importantly, the project can also serve as the spark that will ignite development of UBBM composting programs throughout the United States that can recover up to 90% of that agency's waste stream.
