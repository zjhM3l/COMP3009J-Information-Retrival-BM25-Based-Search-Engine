At 2 weeks old Jessica smiled on cue.
At 14 months, she spoke in sentences and had a vocabulary of over 250 words.
By the age of 2 she could do a 60 piece puzzle.
She was so far beyond the other children in her daycare that she became the teacher's helper.
At three, Jessie taught herself to read.
What happens when children like Jessie enter school? Are schools prepared to allow her to progress at her own rate? Unfortunately, too often the answer to this question is no.
Jessie is expected to wait patiently while other children learn skills and knowledge she has already mastered.
She is implicitly taught to slow down her natural rate of learning to make the teacher and the other students more comfortable.
But Jessie pays a price for her social adaptation (Kerr, 1985, 1994).
She learns to be less than she can be, to slide by without stretching herself, to deny her talents, and, eventually, to trade her dreams for simpler, less demanding goals.
This tragic waste of Jessie's potential affects not only her, but also society, for we have all lost whatever gifts she might have contributed.
Instead of teaching to the lowest common denominator, schools need to become a place where individual differences are appreciated, and where talents are recognized and nurtured.
Our society needs Jessica's gifts, and the fully developed abilities of all the other gifted and talented children, in order to actualize its enormous potential as a world leader.
However, in recent years, our educational system seems to have lost sight of this fact.
We are just beginning to emerge from the mass hallucination of America as "Lake Woebegone" where all children are above average.
In some districts, individual differences have become more than inconvenient; they have been legislated out of existence.
With all good intentions, the zealots of school reform want all children to be successful in school and to have an equal opportunity to succeed in life.
This is an admirable goal.
Certainly, we need to be concerned about those children who perform poorly in school.
But equal opportunity does not and can never mean equal outcomes without obliterating individual differences and destroying the fabric of American life.
We have always been a country of rugged individualists, and our differences have been protected by law.
We have strong sanctions against persecution and oppression of people of different religions, races, national origins, and those with physical handicaps, but the gifted are still fair game.
Each time a taunt based on a child's exceptionality (such as 'nerd' or "dweeb") is permitted in the classroom or on the playground, each time a highly gifted child is deliberately held back academically, each time a school policy prohibits academic acceleration or continuous progress, we need to ask, "What messages are we giving all children about developing talents, about the value of academic achievement, and about intellectual diversity?" The school climate needs to support all students-including the most gifted.
We would never allow racial or ethnic slurs to go on unchecked in today's schools, nor would we deliberately thwart the intellectual growth of a child with a disability.
Yet, profoundly gifted children (and their families) routinely must deal with these issues....
(Kearney, 1993) The Attack Against Giftedness For decades, the gifted have been alternately applauded and neglected, exploited and ignored, mined as a national resource and then forgotten, but never in America's history has its brightest minds and their advocates endured such unbridled attack as in the last few years.
Witness the publication of George's (1992) How to Untrack Your Schools, by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD)--the main organization of educational administrators, or Margolin's (1993; 1994) Goodness Personified--The Emergence of Gifted Children, or Sapon-Shevin's (1994) Playing Favorites - Gifted Education and the Disruption of Community.
All three of these reformers link gifted education with racism, elitism, and economic caste systems.
Sapon-Shevin (1994) tells us that "gifted programs provide a way to resegregate schools without requiring people to move" (p. 35).
Margolin (1994) would have us believe that giftedness is a social construction to maintain hierarchical power relations in our society.
George (1992) admonishes that "all students should be deemed worthy and capable of learning everything the school has to offer" (p. 4), which implies that the offering of subjects suited for advanced students, such as Latin, calculus, or the study of Shakespeare, would automatically make some students feel unworthy.
George's ideas are being implemented in a middle school in Gainesville, Florida, where all seventh graders take algebra together, even if some have not mastered addition and others are ready for calculus.
What's wrong with this picture? Most opponents of gifted education believe that the majority of children labeled "gifted" are economically advantaged.
In reality, the gifted come from all social classes (Dickinson, 1970), and poor children have less opportunity to achieve academic success.
While the percentage of gifted students among the upper classes may be higher, there is a much greater number of gifted children among the lower classes (Zigler 
If we abandon gifted programs, gifted children from culturally diverse groups and low socioeconomic circumstances will be the ones to suffer most.
Affluent parents can send their children to private schools or some two-parent families can opt to homeschool their children.
But the majority of gifted children will not have those options.
These children are prevented from fulfilling their potential when public school provisions for the gifted are eliminated.
Instead, greater efforts must be made to include bright children from all socioeconomic classes in gifted programs.
The claim that special services for gifted students create elitism also is unsupported by research (Newland, 1976).
Elitism is a function of socioeconomic differences, not intellectual ones.
In teaching and counseling gifted students, I have found that feelings of inferiority in the gifted are much more prevalent than feelings of superiority.
Those children who act superior usually feel isolated and use their verbal abilities as a defense against the rejection of their agemates.
Separating gifted students from each other and ignoring their needs actually fosters elitism to a greater extent than congregating them for advanced instruction.
Students who are the smartest in their class for 12 years, never crack a book or take home homework, and ace all the tests without studying, can get a ballooned sense of their own importance and place in the universe.
When gifted students are placed in classes 8 together, they do not come to the conclusion that they are "better than everyone else."
Rather, they are humbled by finding peers who know more than they do.
"Conceit was corrected, rather them fostered, by the experience of daily contact with a large number of equals" (Hollingworth, 1930, p. 445).
Much of the fear of elitism is based on the assumption that if individuals discover that they are unusually able, they will develop aristocratic values, caring little for the plight of others.
However, research indicates that exactly the opposite is true.
Giftedness often is accompanied by a strong sense of responsibility, empathy, moral concern and compassion (Dabrowski, 1972; Hollingworth, 1942; Marland, 1972; Passow, 1988; Terman, 1925; Ward, 1985).
The gifted in our country are the backbone of social reform and egalitarianism.
They care desperately about injustice (Roeper, 1988).
Programming for gifted students enhances these higher values, rather than creating an aristocracy.
Why We Need Gifted Education Why do we need gifted education? Because gifted children exist and they will continue to exist despite their unpopularity.
In fact, there are more and more gifted children being born each day, and we have a moral obligation to meet their needs.
They need the opportunity for continuous progress; this as a basic educational right.
All children have the right to learn new concepts in school every day.
Because, despite clichÃ¯Â¿Â½s to the contrary, many gifted children do not make it on their own.
Some become dropouts (Marland, 1972), delinquents (Seeley 
For every child with recognized gifts, still another goes unrecognized (Dickinson, 1970).
Gifted children may have learning disabilities or other handicaps, and these dual exceptionalities tend to mask each other so that the child appears average (Silverman, 1989).
Unrecognized and undeveloped talents may be lost permanently.
The potential concert violinist must have a violin and continuous nurturing of this ability to fulfill its potential.
Because giftedness does not develop in a vacuum.
We have romanticized the "self-made man," but research indicates that native ability requires considerable cultivation to develop fully (Bloom, 1985; Feldman, 1986).
We cannot know how much talent has been lost for lack of discovery and development, nor can we assess the magnitude of that loss to our society--the music that was never composed, the medical cure that was never discovered, the political strategy that might have averted a war.
Because eliminating programs for the gifted is as unethical as eliminating programs for the mentally handicapped.
If children who are developmentally advanced had the same protection under the law as children who are developmentally delayed, it would also be illegal.
It is unrealistic to expect a regular classroom teacher to teach one child addition and another precalculus.
Yet, children of the same age may differ to that degree in their development.
Special programs are essential for the welfare of children with special needs.
Because our democracy, as well as our position as a world leader, is being endangered by substituting socialization for education.
While other countries enable their brightest students 9 to go as far as possible in their learning, we have adopted the notion that one curriculum fits all, and are using our most capable students to serve as assistant teachers instead of allowing them to progress and develop their abilities.
It is misguided to believe that holding back the brightest students magically helps the slower ones; bringing the top down does not bring the bottom up.
Gifted as Asynchrony With all of these arguments, it is still difficult to dissuade vocal opponents of giftedness when giftedness is defined as high achievement in school or the potential for recognized accomplishment in adult life.
The fact is that achievement is very much a function of opportunity (Hollingworth, 1926), and greater opportunities for success are available to those who have greater financial resources.
Achievement, particularly recognized individual achievement, is culturally determined (Silverman, 1997).
Another way of understanding giftedness is to see it as developmental advancement.
In every culture, there are children who develop at a faster pace from early childhood on, are inquisitive to a greater degree than their agemates, generalize concepts earlier than their peers, demonstrate advanced verbal or spatial capacities at an early age, have superb memories, grasp abstract concepts, love to learn, have a sophisticated sense of humor, prefer complexity, are extraordinarily insightful, have a passion for justice, are profoundly aware, and experience life with great intensity.
While these traits may or may not propel the individual to world renown, they appear to correlate with moral sensitivity in childhood (Silverman, 1994).
This alternative way of perceiving giftedness has been captured by the Columbus Group in the following definition: Giftedness is asynchronous development in which advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity combine to create inner experiences and awareness that are qualitatively different from the norm.
This asynchrony increases with higher intellectual capacity.
The uniqueness of the gifted renders them particularly vulnerable and requires modifications in parenting, teaching and counseling in order for them to develop optimally.
(The Columbus Group, 1991) Internal asynchrony is due to differences in rates of physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and skill development in the gifted child.
Uneven development is mirrored in external adjustment difficulties since the gifted person often feels different from, or out of place with, others.
External asynchrony, then, is the lack of fit of the gifted child with other same-aged children and with the age-related expectations of the culture.
Uneven development is a universal characteristic of giftedness.
Gifted children, in any cultural milieu, have greater discrepancies among various facets of their development than average children (Silverman, 1993a; 1994).
The clearest example of this unevenness is the rate at which mental development outstrips physical development.
Binet constructed the mental age as a means of capturing the degree to which a child's mental abilities differ from those of other children his or her chronological age (Binet 
The concept of 10 mental age has proved enormously helpful in our understanding of recognize the inherent difficulties of having a 17-year-old body with a However, we still do not understand that it is equally problematic to have a trapped in the body of a 9 year old.
This type of asynchrony doesn't arouse retardation.
We 9-year-old mind.
17-year-old mind much sympathy.
A child's mental age predicts the amount of knowledge he or she has mastered, the rate at which the child learns, sophistication of play, age of true peers, maturity of the child's sense of humor, ethical judgment, and awareness of the world.
In contrast, chronological age predicts the child's height, physical coordination, handwriting speed, emotional needs, and social skills.
The greater the degree to which cognitive development outstrips physical development, the more "out-of-sync" the child feels internally, in social relations, and in relation to the school curriculum.
The situation becomes even more complicated when it is understood that psychologically the child is an amalgam of many developmental ages (Tolan, 1989) and may appear to be different ages in different situations: In terms of development chronological age may be the least relevant piece of information to consider.
Kate, with an IQ score of 170, may be six, but she has a 'mental age' of ten and a half...
Unfortunately, Kate, like every highly gifted child, is an amalgam of many developmental ages.
She may be six while riding a bike, thirteen while playing the piano or chess, nine while debating rules, eight while choosing hobbies and books, five (or three) when asked to sit still.
How can such a child be expected to fit into a classroom designed around norms for six year olds? (p. 7) The asynchrony that besets the gifted is both a blessing and a curse.
If we view giftedness only within a competitive framework, then the most gifted among us are certainly the most cursed, because they cannot fit into society as it currently is, nor can they succeed by its standards.
They are likely to be seen as defective in today's world; they lack the competitive drive to win and they cannot comfortably "play the game" at school or work, ignoring the power plays and moral infractions.
Advanced, asynchronous development is not an advantage in a race toward personal gain.
It does not give the individual an edge in the competition.
Rather, the cognitive and personality traits that comprise giftedness are disadvantages in a society in which those differences are not valued.
We need to see beyond the narrow lens of competitiveness to grasp the deeper significance of giftedness.
When we look at the gifted from a global perspective, it is clear that the development of each person's gifts benefits all of society.
Every human being has a unique contribution to make to the whole.
Kierkegaard has been quoted as saying that we all come into this world with "sealed orders" and we each must discover what those orders are and follow them (Tolan, 1995).
Everyone's orders are different.
What is the point of competing if we all have a different role to play? Gifted individuals come equipped with the exact combination of unusual strengths and weaknesses--the perfect asynchrony--to fulfill their own sealed orders.
We, too, who have been called to help these children develop, have been given very sacred orders of our own.
We know that some of the children in our care have come to lead us to a more humane, harmonious existence.
We who cherish gifted children 11 have been entrusted with guiding and guarding the future of our planet.
With our help, these children's gifts will become blessings to themselves and to the Universe.

14 Guiding and Supporting Development of Gifted Children By Tracy Cross Having spent several years conducting research, working directly with gifted students in the role of teacher, counselor and program director and reading others' studies on the topic of the social and emotional needs of gifted students, I have come to believe that there are several strategies that will help parents, teachers and counselors guide gifted children.
Some of the topics have a substantial research base; some have only a modest research base; and some have little to no published research base supporting them.
Cutting across these ideas is a form of conventional wisdom which is primarily due to the fact that our professional experiences become our primary source of data as we try to make sense of the world.
Although I believe there is danger in relying too much on personal experiences when making generalizations, I do respect the fact that drawing on multiple forms of data, including personal experience, is an appropriate method for making informed decisions.
So, to break with my past practice of trying to only forward ideas that have emerged from published research findings, I am going to provide a partial list of ideas that I believe have merit when trying to guide gifted children.
Consider these ideas for teachers, counselors and parents who guide the social and emotional development of gifted children: 1.
As you consider your role in the development of a gifted child, realize that your best efforts cannot prevent all the struggles and emotional turmoil from occurring in the child's life.
Your efforts may, however, allow the child to effectively transcend the difficulties associated with youth and particularly those issues unique to gifted children.
2.
Remember that the gifted child is a child first.
Adults often forget that the young person they are dealing with is, in fact, a child.
It is difficult to remember when listening to gifted children talk about academic topics that he or she is very likely to be at the same general developmental level in the social and emotional domain as nongifted peers.
Treat children as young people first and deal with their specific gifts second.
3.
Communication among the three groups of adults (parents, teachers, counselors) is vital.
Each group needs a clear understanding of the child and the parents' and teachers' goals for the child.
These three groups of adults often have different goals for the students.
Consequently, it is important to share appropriate information.
4.
Try to understand the social milieu of the school, or the classroom, through the eyes of the child.
This is a difficult task, but well worthwhile.
I have been astounded and dismayed by the extent to which the social expectations for students are never openly discussed or understood.
Often the teacher and other school personnel have quite divergent views of what it means to be a student or a gifted student.
Moreover, students also hold a wide variety of opinions about what they think being a student means and how they should behave in various school settings.
Therefore, talking 15 5.

openly about the expectations for students can help them feel more comfortable in the school.
Serve as a clearinghouse for information about gifted students.
Share the information via meetings and by sharing literature.
Since none of the three groups of adults (parents, teachers, counselors) receives significant training on the nature and needs of gifted students, it is important to create opportunities for them to learn how to be proactive in the child's life.
The ERIC Clearinghouse has invaluable information prepared for this purpose.
Other sources of information include local colleges and universities, state agencies, the National Association for Gifted Children, the Association for the Gifted and the Internet.
Make available individual, group and family counseling for gifted students and their families.
Although relatively easy to organize, it is rarely done.
If this is difficult to arrange, then share materials with each group as a means to better prepare the various professionals who work with gifted children.
Learn about the child's personality and social goals.
This will enable all three groups to guide the child through the school years.
When pursuing this strategy, be sure to include information from the field of "general" psychology.
The vast majority of facts within the field of psychology are applicable to the lives of gifted students.
Teach the child to better understand his or her nature and anticipate how to react to events and circumstances in his or her life.
Part of this understanding may be accomplished through personality and interest inventories.
Astute adults in positions to provide observationally based information may also be very helpful to the child.
This strategy calls for three groups of adults to work together.
Provide opportunities for gifted children to be together.
This opportunity seems to alleviate some of the pressures a gifted child feels.
For example, gifted students often report feeling different from other students, except when they have time to be together.
When together, they often comment on the profound sense of relief of knowing there are other people like themselves who have many similar interests and qualities.
Part Two 1.
Recognize and respect the relationship between social and emotional needs and academic needs.
One affects the other.
For example, whether a gifted student is challenged or able to work at a pace that is stimulating can affect his or her emotional well being.
Our school psychology clinic at Teachers College at Ball State University has documented that the most common reason gifted students are referred for psychological assessments is rooted in their becoming a behavior problem in school after having previously been a very strong student.
The root of the behavioral change is the manifest frustration with not being challenged in school.
For many students, this connection goes unnoticed until it is far too late to help them.
2.
Be cautious about forcing your desires on students based on your perception of their strength areas.
Talent manifests over time and with opportunity.
Determining for a child what his or her "gift" or "talent" is without allowing for flexibility or encouraging additional self-exploration may cause a number of problems from adolescence on.
A positive outcome of nurturing a talent is the development of a lifelong avocational interest or hobby.
16 3.
Teach pro-social skill development.
Teaching gifted students a handful of social skills can reduce the number of negative experiences they may encounter while in school.
The phrasing of questions and comments and the ability to take another person's perspective are skills that are helpful in teaching gifted students to navigate the difficult social waters in schools.
4.
Teach them to enjoy nonacademic activities.
As appropriate, try to teach gifted students to recognize that nonacademic pursuits are also important in one's life.
They become stress relievers and additional areas where gifted students can grow.
Modeling works well in teaching this lesson.
5.
Teach gifted students ways to manage stress.
As they move through the grades, for many, they will experience growing amounts of stress.
Ironically, much of this will be self-imposed, or a consequence of being treated as gifted by others.
Because many gifted students develop coping strategies, educating them about how to effectively manage stress may prove relatively easy.
6.
To accomplish many of the suggestions previously noted, adults should model the behavior they wish gifted students to exhibit.
Like all children, gifted students learn from the behavior of adults.
Whether it is effective coping strategies, non-threatening communication techniques or how to relax; teachers, counselors and parents often become the models that children follow.
If you want your messages to be influential, let the students see you behaving accordingly.
7.
Understand that much of how gifted students appear and behave is biologically affected - do not try to change the basic nature of the student.
Shyness, for example, like some physical characteristics, has roots in biology.
Like the relationship between body type and weight, shyness and a student's willingness and ability to actively participate in class are related.
Respect the nature of the individual gifted child.
8.
Embrace diversity, do not merely tolerate it.
To tolerate suggests a position of authority or position of judgment that allows someone to decide what human differences are meaningful and therefore acceptable, and what differences are intolerable.
This special privileged position tends to disadvantage gifted students because giftedness rarely makes peoples' list of meaningful differences.
As a teacher, parent or counselor, you are in a position to have a significant impact on the minds of gifted children.
If a school truly embraces diversity, then gifted students will be accepted.
In many schools, giftedness is still experienced as being aberrant.
In a study a few years ago, I found that gifted students are just as prone to believe stereotypical ideas about other gifted students as the general population.
This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that gifted students can not escape their environment.
9.
Expose gifted students to knowledgeable counseling - avoid professionals who are not knowledgeable about gifted students.
A proactive counseling program can be invaluable to gifted students.
Learning about oneself and how to effectively relate to others in school can positively affect the psychological development of gifted students.
Conversely, messages learned from untrained counselors and psychologists who rely on intuition when providing services can actually exacerbate problems in the social and emotional realm.
10.
Know that many gifted students will have created coping strategies while in the earliest grades in school.
I have found that by first grade some gifted children have begun to engage in behavior patterns that reveal that they are not comfortable with the gifted student label.
Some of these strategies reflect their tacit knowledge about the 17 social milieu of their classroom.
Knowing that these patterns exist can enable teachers, counselors and parents to understand the worries and behaviors surrounding gifted students' school experience.
11.
Provide opportunities for down time.
All children need time to relax, to be away from school concerns.
Arranging down time for some students will come easy, but for others it will be quite difficult.
Providing gifted students opportunities to explore or read for pleasure can reduce stress and may have the positive effect of increasing avocational pursuits when they get older.
Part Three - Working on Behalf of Gifted Students Some of the ideas are reasonably well researched, while others are rooted in my professional experiences.
A number are somewhat specific to gifted students while others might be as effective with students of average ability.
Some of the ideas respect biological influences while others emphasize environmental influences in this area.
Implicit in the suggestions is the assumption that the lives of gifted students in schools can be better if the three groups (teachers, parents, counselors) communicate about the students.
Clearly, only some of the ideas expressed across the series will be relevant for any specific student given his or her particular circumstances in life.
Consequently, the groups of adults need to assess the salience of the ideas before attempting to pursue them.
1.
The first suggestion is to encourage controlled risk taking.
Although it may seem on the surface to be an oxymoron, it really is not.
Imagine the lives of professional stunt men and women.
People who earn a living by risking their lives do so with careful planning.
They take obvious risks to their physical well being, but they do so after great effort has gone into building safety nets that minimize the potential for their harm.
Similarly, gifted students need to take risks to build same and opposite sex friendships and communicate with other students and teachers.
To engage in this type of social risk taking, safeguards need to be in place.
Parents, teachers and counselors can create those safety nets with preparation.
For example, building an accepting environment in a classroom and school establishes a climate that supports emotional and social risk taking.
This suggestion dovetails into the next one.
2.
Provide myriad social experiences for gifted students.
In concert, the three groups of adults can orchestrate varied situations where gifted students interact with a wide variety of people.
These types of experiences will build social skills specific to contexts and have the effect of developing the gifted students' social cognition.
As the students have positive experiences, their self-concepts will also be enhanced.
3.
Inventory family similarities and differences as compared to schoolmates.
In some school settings the diversity is obvious, while in others it is not.
It can be helpful to gifted students for their parents, particularly, and teachers and counselors less so, to let them know what their family's values, practices, and beliefs are, and how they vary across groups of people.
If done within the context of diversity, then their giftedness can be accepted as quite normal, rather than aberrant.
4.
To accomplish the third suggestion, one approach is to encourage the reading of biographies of eminent people.
This is considered a form of bibliotherapy.
The details provided in the biographies will often cause two events to occur.
The consciousness of the gifted student will be raised as to the experiences the eminent person had that impacted on his or her development.
For example, some of the scientists in Germany 18 prior to World War 11 speak about their lives as Jews during the rise of Hitler and the strong anti-Semitism that pervaded Germany.
The second event that often occurs is the combination of comparing the reader's life with that of the person in the biography, and then the awareness that many highly accomplished people also struggled with some of the same issues affecting the reader's life.
This realization tends to reduce feelings of isolation while at the same time providing ideas for dealing with the difficulties gifted people encounter.
Part of the potential effectiveness of the bibliotherapy approach is that the reader engages and creates his or her understanding.
This is a vastly different experience than having one's parent discuss issues with you.
Although both reading biographies and discussing with parents can be successful, using both approaches may prove more beneficial than relying on only one.
5.
A second approach for educating about diversity is to provide mentorship opportunities for gifted students.
Apprenticeships can have many positive effects, including numerous ones in the skill building domain.
In this example, it is important to note the connection with the life story aspect of psychological development.
For example, working with a mentor teaches many lessons including who is the mentor and what pathway he or she followed to become what they are from the mentor's own perspective.
Through this person's life story, salient issues in the individual development of the mentor can be recognized and understood by the gifted student.
Like the effects of bibliotherapy, connecting with a significant adult who represents an academic area of interest of a gifted student offers many opportunities for the gifted student to appreciate and navigate the social and emotional waters of his or her life.
6.
Love and respect gifted students for who they are.
Then, emphasize doing rather than being.
Ability and talent are neutral constructs while doing is virtuous.
Try to help them understand that being academically able does not make a person good or bad, per se.
Rather, like many characteristics one has, it is how one strives to develop, and subsequently use other abilities, that makes him or her virtuous.
It is important both for gifted students and others that they develop their talents.
Moreover, avocational talent is important, too.
The overemphasis by the three groups of adults on the students' abilities tends to create feelings by gifted students that they are nothing but their academic ability or achievement.
This can led to myriad problems like underachievement, unnecessary suffering when doing poorly in school, the unwillingness to stretch beyond areas of prior attainment and identity foreclosure.
Identity foreclosure is the result of deciding at too young an age where to emphasize one's professional aspirations.
Deciding to pursue math as a career because early in one's life a person is taught that they are particularly able in that area will often lead to the student choosing not to risk failure in other areas.
Hence, potential talent areas are never identified.
Negative patterns within careers also exist for many who decided about their career too early in life.
7.
Encourage a self-concept that extends far beyond the academic self-concept.
It is never beneficial to a gifted student to convince him that only academic achievement is valuable.
What good is a person to society who can calculate advanced math problems at an early age, but who has developed no civic responsibilities.
Although I do not accept the claim that schools should attempt to develop equally the "whole" person, I do believe that gifted students should be appreciated as children who 19 develop over time and consequently deserve the rights to develop various aspects of their being.
As in every preceding example, the three groups of adults need to work together for this suggestion to be realized.
Teachers, parents, and counselors should recognize the important roles they play in the psychological development of gifted students.
Gifted students will develop with or without adult guidance.
The question is "How will they develop without coordinated guidance that is underpinned by research in developmental psychology and informed research on gifted students' lives in school?" My answer is that it is inconceivable that they can develop as well and as painlessly without the support of the three groups of adults.
Let us commit to supporting the psychological development of all students, including gifted students.

Dr. Cross is currently serving as President of IAG. 20 What Childhood Traits Predict Adult Success? By Herbert J. Walberg, Ph.D. and Edward A. Wynne, Ph.D.
Successful people - those with recognized achievements - have been studied for centuries.
Walberg and Wynne (1994), distilled the research on successful adults and found five traits that are highly predictive of adult success and eminence.
They are: 1.
Hard Work.
The authors describe the notion of "workaholic" and all its negative connotations as an invention of the 20th century and go on to describe how society used to value extremely hard work.
Successful adults were children who were unafraid of hard work.
2.
Personal Knowledge.
There is no doubt that successful people are well-informed in a variety of areas and can easily apply knowledge from one field to another.
Walberg and Wynne caution against regarding retrieved information as personal knowledge and forward the idea that personal understanding is the ability to make immediate associations from large and varied knowledge bases.
3.
Support and Criticism.
Successful adults had "strong support and significant criticism" as children.
Polite, universal acceptance of children's responses reduces their ability to apply logic and to figure out the world.
Children's views should be challenged.
Children should be allowed to test their mettle by close monitoring, criticism and personalized support.
4.
Making and Keeping Commitments.
How do children learn to choose goals they should pursue? Walberg and Wynne stated that "classrooms provide few opportunities for students to commit themselves to wise, arduous goals" and that children need lots of chances to learn how and when to commit their energies.
5.
Successfully Completing Difficult Tasks.
Finishing meaningful work results when one makes wise choices and persists in those choices.
The authors made a case for allowing children to develop specialized talents at a young age instead of the popular notion of enduring long periods of school to prepare for "real life."
They encouraged difficult tasks at home and school that require realistic long-term goals.

21 Meeting Parents' Needs By Patricia King Rash Most parents of gifted children have a natural ability to rear their offspring because of their own giftedness.
However, that ability does not negate the fact that parenting a gifted child is a mixed blessing that presents unusual circumstances (Silverman, 1997).
Parents of gifted children have a more complex task than parents of non-gifted children, because they have to deal with the giftedness as well as the natural childishness in their progeny (Cornell, 1984).
They may even feel different from other parents because of the challenges their children present (Saunders 
Parents of newly identified gifted children frequently hope for some kind of guidance, because they are convinced that they cannot cope and deal with feelings of inadequacy (Bridges, 1973).
Because of their particular expertise, teachers are able to assist parents of capable children in meeting many of their unique needs.
Teachers often have some of the following knowledge that may be helpful in providing answers to a problem that concerns a parent.
Characteristics Parents need to be aware of the characteristics of gifted children that differ from those of same-age normal children.
Gifted children walk, talk, and understand earlier than other children.
They may display motor abilities beyond what is normally accepted for a child at an early age.
They frequently use more words, display a greater attention span, use more complex sentences, and exhibit speedier learning.
They may also have a more intense need for books, and use toys and tools in a larger variety of ways and with more complexity.
They are sometimes able to decipher codes, patterns, and puzzles, create play activities, and demonstrate deeper understanding of questions and answers from grown-ups (Smutny, Veenker, 
Some gifted children exhibit an early interest in time, others use abstract reasoning and have a sharp sense of humor (Silverman, 1997).
Oftentimes they show extraordinary alertness and insatiable curiosity, and some are more comfortable in the company of adults (Takacs, 1986) They may ask a barrage of questions, have very intense activity levels, need less sleep, have excellent memories, and suffer from asynchronous development (Walker, 1991).
Identification Parents need to know that it is vital for gifted children to be identified early to enable early intervention, just as it is important to identify handicapped children early (Silverman, 1997).
Parents should have an understanding of the various methods of identification that are used in the field of gifted education, such as intelligence and achievement tests; teacher, parent, or peer nominations; creativity assessments; evaluation of products or performances; grades; and task commitment (Walker, 1991).
Some districts apply alternative evaluations, such as performance-based, authentic, and portfolio assessments.
In addition, there are different models that may be used with diverse populations, such as Gardner's (1983) Theory of Multiple Intelligences, Maker's (1996) DISCOVER approach, and Frasier's (1997) Frasier Talent Assessment Profile (F-TAP Model).
School Options Teachers can provide information that will help parents better understand school options, such as public, private, and magnet schools, or advanced placement, honors, and gifted 22 education programs.
To promote the best education for their gifted children, teachers can give parents an understanding of the nature of a differentiated curriculum and whether or not gifted students in their district are receiving that accommodation.
They should be made aware of the availability of gifted programs, acceleration, early entrance, grade placement, and home schooling.
They need to be knowledgeable about after-school enrichment programs, the availability of early college entrance, the possibility of simultaneous enrollment in high school and college, and whether internships, mentorships, and scholarships are available (Silverman, 1997).
Advocacy Parents can be taught to appropriately advocate for their gifted children.
They have both a right and a moral obligation to be involved in their child's education, and they may do so by being either proactive or reactive.
With the teacher's support, parents will choose to be proactive by forging a relationship with the school, anticipating needs, and preventing problems before they arise (Saunders 
Teachers can encourage parents to help their schools make changes through proactive behaviors, such as volunteering to work on specific projects, participating in parent groups, supporting state legislation, and taking part in fund raising activities.
Reactive advocacy should be used only when all the proactive steps do not work out to the parents' satisfaction (Marland, 1981).
When parents are faced with school districts that deny legal rights, they should think about and decide whether to become reactive.
Many of those issues are discussed in books by Karnes and Marquardt (1991 a, 1991b, 1991c).
Myths It is important that parents know fact from fiction, both for their own understanding and to help quash myths that have surrounded gifted students throughout history.
There was even an ancient theory that giftedness was related to insanity, a concept that was invalidated by the Terman studies whose results found that gifted individuals were well adjusted (Gallagher, 1997).
In fact, research implies that bright people tend to be more stable than the general population (Walker, 1991).
Gifted children are often thought to be weak and unhealthy, but that is not true.
They are considered to be oddballs, but the fact is that teachers frequently fail to identify them because they seem so normal.
They are widely seen as bookworms, but they engage in all types of activities and interests.
The myth holds that gifted kids all love school; however many are bored and too many drop out.
It has been believed that gifted students are only from upper-middle class, Anglo, and professional families, but the truth is that gifted children are found in all cultures and at all socioeconomic levels.
Some consider it fact that most gifted children suffered from early ripe, early rot; in reality, outstanding successes can usually be achieved only when they are identified early and their giftedness is nurtured.
As a group, gifted kids are believed to be social misfits; but to the contrary, they enjoy social situations.
It is thought that their play interests and activities are different from that of peers, but they are usually the same as those of their age mates, though perhaps with added complexity.
They have been pictured as egotistical and snobbish, but most possess positive personality traits.
It has been thought that many fail to adjust socially in college because they were accelerated as children, but current studies support that, unless the acceleration was excessive, most make very good social adjustments in college (Kasen 
And finally, we want to be certain we make parents aware that, although it was and sometimes still is believed that gifted children do not need special help, it is now known that to be 23 successful, most gifted children need accommodation (Lightcap, 1985).
Parents should be encouraged to actively seek the appropriate accommodation for their gifted child.
Misunderstood Parents of gifted kids must be prepared to be misunderstood and undervalued.
"Any exceptionality places a heavy burden of responsibility on the parent, but parents of gifted children have the added stress of being continuously discounted" (Silverman, 1997).
Instead of being applauded for their support, parents of gifted children must constantly be on guard to protect themselves from abuse.
Parents often are accused of elitism when they are merely seeking appropriate education for their gifted children (Walker, 1991).
Organize Parents of the gifted often experience feelings of aloneness.
"The best way to stop feeling isolated is by joining a group of parents with similar concerns" (Saunders 
The importance of participating in parent organizations is worth stressing to parents (Rimm, 1994; Walker, 1991).
Organizing gives them the opportunity to share problems, experiences, and joys with one another.
It helps their ability to bring about needed change within the school system, organize group activities for their children, and influence lawmakers (Takacs, 1986).
Since gifted children are in the minority, appropriate programming for them will be provided only where there is a "vocal and visible support group" (Davis 
Parents should create or join a parent organization as a statement that their gifted offspring are valued and that they champion education and cultural growth.
According to Clark (1997), parents should "organize first, then become informed" (p. 177).
Educators can play a vital part in the education of parents by suggesting that they participate in a local, state, or national organization, and by providing them with relevant information.
Some authors have published the names and addresses of such advocacy groups: Rimm (1994); Robinson, (1993); Walker (1991); Smumy, Veenker, and Veenker (1989); Saunders and Espeland (1986); Takacs (1986); and Kerr (1985).
Burnout Parents should be encouraged and commended when they do things they like doing, as well as things in which their children are interested (Clark,1997).
The parents' social and emotional lives should not be ignored, and they should have their own hobbies and interests.
They should take time to be creative, think calming thoughts, have adult friendships, and seek and accept help when it is needed.
Parents need support from other parents of gifted children in order to avoid burnout (Walker, 1991).
They should have strategies for taking care of themselves, lest they lose their zest.
Teachers can influence parents to set realistic goals, take a break from their children once in a while, look for the humor in life, start new activities, and get help when necessary (Saunders 
Resources Educators can provide parents with the sites of on line resources that supply general information about gifted children, their education, and parenting.
The Internet has hundreds of listings.
The National Research Center for Gifted and Talented (NRCGT) has a web site that may be contacted at the following address: www.ucc.uconn.edu/~wwwgt/nrcgt.html.
It 24 provides abstracts of current research findings in gifted education and information about how to obtain NRC/GT's published material.
Many on line sources are interactive, providing an opportunity for questions and answers.
Current technology should not be ignored as a valuable resource.
Educators may assist parents by making them aware of special meetings, programs, conferences, workshops, and seminars.
They can also provide conferences for parents that are responsive to specific needs.
Provide for at least one activity that ensures parents meet with one another to build their support network.
Keep the admission charge free or low enough for all parents to attend.
Be sure the location is central, and the meeting date and time are well publicized.
Assure that the atmosphere is informal, but professional.
If at all possible, provide child care.
Follow-up is very important and may be done through newsletters, lectures, telephone trees, or even through simple mail-outs of relevant information.
Most parents are not aware of the many journals and other written materials that may be of value to them.
Teachers can provide that information.
These authors include lists of recommend books: Rimm (1994); Silverman (1993); Alvino and the Editors of Gifted Children Monthly (1989); Smumy, Veenker, and Veenker (1989); Saunders and Espeland (1986); and Takacs (1986).
It is a good idea for teachers to create and distribute their personally recommended reading lists as well.
A frequently neglected resource is the publishers of materials for and about gifted children.
They will happily send multiple copies of their catalogs and flyers for distribution to parents and groups.
Prufrock Press, Free Spirit Publishing, and Gifted Psychology Press are only a few of the publishers who are more than willing to accommodate teachers and parents who request catalogs.
Summary Parents needs have often been neglected.
They frequently feel alone and confused, and they regularly receive incorrect advice from well-meaning, but ill-advised sources.
Educators can provide parents with knowledge about the characteristics of gifted children, how they are identified, and whether they are being educated appropriately.
Parents can learn the best ways to work with the school in their efforts to support gifted education.
They can organize and participate in support groups.
And finally, teachers can encourage them to get involved in activities that meet their personal needs that are unrelated to the needs of their children.

Helping Your Highly Gifted Child By Stephanie Tolan Most parents greet the discovery that their child is not merely gifted but highly or profoundly gifted with a combination of pride, excitement, and fear.
They may set out to find experts or books to help them cope with raising such a child, only to find that there are no real experts, only a couple of books, and very little understanding of extreme intellectual potential and how to develop it.
This digest deals with some areas of concern and provides a few practical suggestions based on the experience of other parents and the modest amount of research available.
DIFFERENCES To understand highly gifted children it is essential to realize that, although they are children with the same basic needs as other children, they are very different.
Adults cannot ignore or gloss over their differences without doing serious damage to these children, for the differences will not go away or be outgrown.
They affect almost every aspect of these children's intellectual and emotional lives.
A microscope analogy is one useful way of understanding extreme intelligence.
If we say that all people look at the world through a lens, with some lenses cloudy or distorted, some clear, and some magnified, we might say that gifted individuals view the world through a microscope lens and highly gifted individuals view it through an electron microscope.
They see ordinary things in very different ways and often see what others simply cannot see.
Although there are advantages to this heightened perception, there are disadvantages as well.
Since many children eventually become aware of being different, it is important to prepare yourself for your child's reactions.
When your child's giftedness has been identified, you might open a discussion using the microscope analogy.
If you are concerned that such a discussion will promote arrogance, be sure to let the child know that unusual gifts, like hair and eye color, are not earned.
It is neither admirable nor contemptible to be highly gifted.
It is what one does with one's abilities that is important.
A UNITED FRONT As in most other aspects of parenting, it is important for both parents (or the adults who bear primary responsibility for raising the child) to agree on some basic issues regarding the child's potential.
Some parents of exceptionally gifted children were themselves gifted or exceptionally gifted children.
If they did not learn to accept and understand their own giftedness, they may find it difficult to accept their child's unusual capacities.
Raising a highly gifted child may help parents come to terms with many difficult aspects of their own lives, but it helps if they focus first on the needs of the child and come to an agreement about how to meet them.
27 WHAT HIGHLY GIFTED CHILDREN NEED Exceptionally gifted children have two primary needs.
First, they need to feel comfortable with themselves and with the differences that simultaneously open possibilities and create difficulty.
Second, they need to develop their astonishing potential.
There is a strong internal drive to develop one's abilities.
Thwarting that drive may lead to crippling emotional damage.
Throughout the parenting years, it is wise to keep in mind that the healthiest long-term goal is not necessarily a child who gains fame, fortune, and a Nobel Prize, but one who becomes a comfortable adult and uses gifts productively.
THE EARLY YEARS Before your child begins formal schooling, differences can be handled by your willingness to follow the child's lead and meet needs as they arise.
It is possible and important to treat an infant's or toddler's precocity with a degree of normalcy.
For example, a 2-year-old who prefers and plays appropriately with toys designed for 6-year-olds should be given those toys.
The 3-year-old who reads should be given books.
The child who speaks very early and with a sophisticated vocabulary should be spoken to in kind.
PUBLIC ATTITUDES Even when parents can take precocious achievements in stride, friends, family, and strangers may not.
Unthinking people will comment (often loudly and in front of the child) that a 2- or 3-year-old who sits in the grocery cart reading packages aloud is a phenomenon.
It may be surprisingly difficult to avoid letting parental pride lure you into encouraging your child to "perform" in public.
Keep in mind the goal of making the child as comfortable as possible with individual differences.
The more casually you accept unusual early accomplishments, the more your child will be able to see those accomplishments as normal.
Later, when gifts are not quite as noticeable, the child will no longer feel that what made him or her valuable has somehow been lost.
MULTIPLE AGES Highly gifted children are many ages simultaneously.
A 5-year-old may read like a 7-yearold, play chess like a 12-year-old, talk like a 13-year-old, and share toys like a 2-year-old.
A child may move with lightning speed from a reasoned discussion of the reasons for taking turns on the playground to a full-scale temper tantrum when not allowed to be first on the swing.
You can help yourself maneuver among the child's ages by reading about developmental norms (Gesell is a good guide) so that you are ready for (and avoid punishing) behavior that, although it seems childish in a precocious child, is absolutely age appropriate.
SCHOOL If your 9-month-old begins speaking in full sentences, you probably will not tell the child to stop and wait till other 9-month-olds catch up.
You would not limit such a child to using nouns because that is as much speech as most 9-month-olds can handle.
However, in public or private school that may be the approach some educators use.
It is important to realize that they are not purposely setting out to keep your child from learning, although that might be the effect.
Many educators have never knowingly dealt with 28 a highly gifted child.
They do not recognize them, and they do not know how to handle them.
Some educators base teaching methods on developmental norms that are inappropriate for highly gifted children.
Although they may be willing to make an effort to accommodate these youngsters, they may lack sufficient information or experience and not know what type of effort to make.
When a child enters school already able to do what the teacher intends to teach, there is seldom a variety of mechanisms for teaching that child something else.
Even if there were a way to provide time, attention, and an appropriate curriculum, it would be necessary for the teacher to use different teaching methods.
Highly gifted children learn not only faster than others, but also differently.
Standard teaching methods take complex subjects and break them into small, simple bits presented one at a time.
Highly gifted minds can consume large amounts of information in a single gulp, and they thrive on complexity.
Giving these children simple bits of information is like feeding an elephant one blade of grass at a time--he will starve before he even realizes that anyone is trying to feed him.
When forced to work with the methods and pace of a typical school, highly gifted children may look not more capable than their peers, but less capable.
Many of their normal characteristics add to this problem.
Their handwriting might be very messy because their hands do not keep pace with their quick minds.
Many spell poorly because they read for comprehension and do not see the words as collections of separate letters.
When they try to "sound out" a word, their logical spelling of an illogical language results in errors.
Most have difficulty with rote memorization, a standard learning method in the early grades.
LACK OF FIT The difficulty with highly gifted children in school may be summarized in don't fit.
Almost all American schools organize groups of children by age.
the highly gifted child is many ages.
The child's intellectual needs might same-age peers, although the gulf may be larger in some subject areas than three words: They As we have seen, be years ahead of in others.
Imagine 6-year-old Rachel.
She reads on a 12th-grade level, although her comprehension is "only" that of a 7th grader.
She does multiplication and division, understands fractions and decimals, but counts on her fingers because she has never memorized addition and subtraction facts or multiplication tables.
Her favorite interests at home are paleontology and astronomy; at school her favorite interests are lunch and recess.
She collects stamps and plays chess.
Although she can concentrate at her telescope for hours at a time, she cannot sit still when she is bored.
She cries easily, loses her temper often, bosses other children when they "don't do it right," and cannot keep track of her personal belongings.
She has a sophisticated sense of humor that disarms adults but is not understood by other children.
Putting Rachel into a regular first grade without paying special attention to her differences is a recipe for social, emotional, and educational disaster.
Even if a gifted program is available (they commonly begin in third or fourth grade), it is unlikely to meet her extreme needs.
Educating a highly gifted child in school is like clothing a 6X child in a store where the largest available garment is a size 3 (or with a gifted program, a 3X).
Parents have to resort to alterations or individual tailoring of whatever kind they can manage.
29 In dealing with school issues, it is important to remember that you know more about your child than anyone else.
Your knowledge, information, and instincts are useful and important, and they should be recognized in designing a school program.
Your child needs individual attention.
Anything else may be directly and seriously harmful.
There is no ideal school pattern for the highly gifted child.
However, when normal school patterns lead to difficulty, it is important to obtain real differentiation.
ACCELERATION Because highly gifted children may begin school already knowing much of the material covered in early grades and because they learn quickly, some type of acceleration is necessary.
For some children and in some situations, grade skipping is the best choice.
Placing a child with older children who share interests may be socially and intellectually beneficial and result in a more appropriate curriculum.
It is also a simple and economical solution for the school.
Some children begin school early; others skip several early grades; others skip whole educational levels, such as junior high or even high school.
Skipping a single year is seldom helpful, because the difference between one grade level and the next is too small.
Grade skipping is not without problems, but allowing highly gifted children to stay in a class that meets few if any of their needs may do serious and long-term damage.
Another type of acceleration is subject matter acceleration.
A child may take mathematics with a class four grades ahead, reading with a class two grades ahead, and physical education with age peers.
This type of acceleration takes into consideration the varying developmental ages of the highly gifted child.
For further flexibility, you might consider evening classes or weekend classes at a high school or college and ask the school to excuse coverage of those subjects in regular classes.
A child might go to school with age mates only in the morning or only in the afternoon.
This method calls for school and parent flexibility and may lead to logistical problems with scheduling and transportation, but it is often more satisfactory than grade skipping, because the child associates at least part of the time with age peers.
WHEN THE SCHOOL WILL NOT CHANGE When parents approach teachers and administrators with information and documentation, in a spirit of cooperation rather than confrontation, offering suggestions and help rather than attacking, some positive changes in normal methods usually result.
Sometimes, however, schools refuse to make changes for one child.
When this happens, parents have few choices.
One is to move to a school system that will make changes.
Another is home schooling.
For many highly gifted children home schooling is a nearly ideal solution to the problem of fit.
Instead of laboriously altering ready-made programs, parents can tailor an education precisely to the child's needs.
Clubs, sports, scouting, and other activities supply social interaction with other children while parents serve as teachers or facilitators or engage tutors or mentors in various subject areas.
Home schooling is seldom an easy choice.
In some districts it is either illegal or beset with regulations that make it almost as rigid as classroom schooling.
When both parents or the single resident parent must work, it may be impossible.
Some parents and children find the level of togetherness stifling, while others cannot avoid pushing and demanding too much.
However, home schooling may be a positive choice for many families.
Many children move 30 surprisingly smoothly from home schooling in the early years into high school or college when their intellectual needs outgrow the home environment.
One of the major benefits of education at home is the maintenance of self-esteem, which is highly problematic in a school environment.
SOCIAL/EMOTIONAL NEEDS In the movie E.T. there was something heartrending in the small alien's attempts to "phone home," in his constant longing for others of his kind despite the loving concern of the family who cared for him.
Highly gifted children endure some of that same pain.
It is hard for them to find kindred spirits, hard for them to feel they fit into the only world they know.
Highly gifted children may have trouble establishing fulfilling friendships with people of their own age when there are few or no other highly gifted children with whom to interact.
As a high school student told his mother, "I can be that part of myself that is like my classmates, and we get along fine.
But there's no one I can share the rest of me with, no one who understands what means the most to me."
For most highly gifted children, social relationships with age peers necessitate a constant monitoring of thoughts, words, and behavior.
One of the greatest benefits of the talent searches proliferating in colleges across the country is the chance for highly gifted children to spend time with others like themselves.
For 3 weeks in the summer, children who qualify (by scoring high enough on the SAT or ACT in the seventh grade or earlier) attend class on a college campus with other highly gifted children.
Rather than feeling like oddballs, they suddenly feel normal.
Lifelong friendships may form in a matter of days.
Many summer program participants consider the social interaction as valuable as the classes.
What else can you do to help highly gifted children find friends? It helps children to understand that there are different types of friends.
They may play baseball, ride bikes, and watch TV with one person; talk about books or movies with another; and play chess or discuss astronomy with another.
Some of these friends may be their own age, some may be younger or, more often, older.
Only in school is it suggested that people must be within a few months of each other in age to form meaningful relationships.
CONCLUSION Raising a highly gifted child may be ecstasy, agony, and everything between.
Adults must perform almost impossible feats of balance--supporting a child's gifts without pushing, valuing without over-investing, championing without taking over.
It is costly, physically and emotionally draining, and intellectually demanding.
In the first flush of pride, few parents realize that their task is in many ways similar to the task faced by parents of a child with severe handicaps.
Our world does not accommodate differences easily, and it matters little whether the difference is perceived to be a deficit or an overabundance.
We have covered only a few issues in this space, but the most important help you can give highly gifted children can be expressed in a single sentence: Give them a safe home, a refuge where they feel love and genuine acceptance, even of their differences.
As adults with a safe home in their background, they can put together lives of productivity and fulfillment.

32 Identifying Students for Services The On-going Dilemma of Effective Identification Practices in Gifted Education By Joyce VanTassel-Baska The identification of gifted children has long been a topic of great debate in the field of gifted education.
More citations in the literature exist on this topic than on any other in the field.
Moreover, it remains one of the most common problems of program development cited by school district personnel and state department coordinators in administering programs and services to gifted children.
Common Problems in Identification There are many reasons for the intractable gifted.
One of them is related to the concept Newer definitional structures are attuned to the nature of the student's background, and individual learners. problems associated with identification of the of absolute versus relative notions of giftedness.
the idea of relativity as we consider the school, the program in order to make decisions about A second issue that continues to be problematic is recognition of the range of individual differences within the group of learners who might be designated "gifted."
We tend to spend a great deal of time deciding who is the last student in the program versus the first student not recommended.
Cutting on a continuum of human ability is a risky venture and one many to justify.
At the same time that such debates on identification rage, highly gifted students frequently idle without extensive and intensive enough services because programs are far more likely to focus resources on the mildly gifted group which may be larger and demand more attention.
Finally there is the nagging concern that underrepresented groups are not adequately being assessed to be included in gifted programs.
Thus we make the test the proverbial messenger to be attacked and continue to search for a better instrument that may reveal greater parity in performance.
Any one of these issues would be sufficient to keep identification at the top of concerns for local school districts in planning and implementing programs.
The three taken together guarantee that identification will always be a controversial topic.
Until our beliefs about identification change, little progress can be made in developing a better system that resolves all of the issues noted.
Our task is not to identify only the truly gifted but also to locate students who demonstrate undeveloped potential intellectually and in specific areas including academic, artistic, and leadership domains.
Our task is not to select students for all time but to select them for enhanced instructional opportunities that may benefit them at a given stage of development.
Whether the intervention works or not, students should be regularly reassessed for new opportunities and dropped from those that are not meeting their needs.
Our task is not to be gatekeepers to exclude students but rather custodians of promoting student growth by recognizing discernible strengths and working with the school community to enhance them 33 whether through the gifted program or another medium.
Establishing numerical cutoffs on relevant criteria may be less useful than gaining a holistic assessment of students being considered and matching program to strengths of a particular population.
The Elusiveness of Giftedness What do we currently understand about the act of identification that may help us deal with the difficulties inherent in the process? First of all, many studies and authors favoring newer conceptual definitions of giftedness acknowledge the multidimensionality of the phenomenon (Gardner, 1991; Sternberg, 19X5).
Some students are omnibus gifted, capable across many domains and areas.
Yet the majority of gifted students are not.
They have distinct profiles of strengths and relative weaknesses.
Their abilities may be discerned by performance and not paper and pencil tests.
Their giftedness may not be evoked by the school environment but shine in the context of community.
Some may experience developmental spurts at key stages of development which could not be discerned earlier.
Interest may be piqued at some stage that motivates a student to develop abilities in relevant areas.
In all of these examples, there is a clear sense that giftedness may be elusive in its manner and context of manifestation.
We also know that there are both genetic and environmental factors at work in the manifestation of giftedness.
Individuals vary considerably in their ability to function effectively in various domains.
Attention must be paid to the "rubber band" effect of human potential--our genetic markers allow for expansive growth and development but not to an unlimited extent.
We can stretch ourselves within a range based on the genetic potential which we possess.
It is the role of education in the larger environment to provide the experiences which may stretch the individual potential in the areas of greatest flexibility for learning.
This recognition of pre-existing individual differences would help educators realize the folly of trying to find a "one size fits all" program of study or curriculum.
As long as differentiated practices are reserved for labeled special populations, the spirit of individualized learning will always be in jeopardy.
Giftedness does not guarantee entitlement to educational privilege, but it does call for a flexible response by schools and other agencies to higher levels of functioning, based on the individual level of functioning not age.
Degree or Extent of Giftedness The concept of degree or extent of giftedness is an important aspect to consider in developing identification processes.
When I directed the talent search program at Northwestern University, I had teachers tell me that seventh grade students who were scoring at the 600 level in mathematics on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) weren't truly precocious in mathematics, even though their scores placed them in the top 2% of the population.
Only the 700's met that criterion.
What these teachers were noting is the wide band of difference that exists within a gifted population such that students at the bottom of a particular group may function very differently from those at the top of the group.
In psychometric language, this means that gifted students may vary among themselves by as much as three standard deviations in respect to mental functioning in one or more areas.
Reading level, for example, in a fifth grade gifted program could range from seventh to college level.
34 The implications of this phenomenon for identification is to decide how broad a group might benefit from a particular intervention and then ensure differentiation of instruction in the delivery of that intervention to ensure adequate challenge for those at the top of the group and yet not cause anxiety to set in for those at the bottom.
Wide ranges of abilities within a gifted population have to be tolerated in most gifted programs since the context of delivery frequently requires sufficient numbers of students to justify the special intervention.
Ability Alone Not Always Sufficient We also know that the recognition of advanced behavior is the most critical variable in determining who can best profit form advanced work and instruction.
To deny services to students clearly advanced in reading, mathematics, the arts, or other domains because they have not been formally assessed calls into question a school system's capacity to respond to individual differences.
This principle of responding to advanced student behaviors is central to including teacher, parent, and community input into the identification process.
Use of domain-specific checklists is one way to assess such behavior in context.
Such checklists also contribute important insights into effective programming for individual children.
Work in talent development (e.g. Csikszentmihalyi, 1996; Simonton, 1999) has convinced most people in our field that ability alone may be insufficient to predict success in gifted programs, let alone life endeavors.
Non-intellectual factors like motivation, personality, persistence, and concentration impact greatly on creative productivity at particular stages of development but also over the lifespan.
Thus our identification processes may need to be sensitive to students whose ability threshold may be slightly lower but whose capacity and zeal to do work in a given domain may be very high.
Tapping into these nonintellectual strengths can best be accomplished through performance and portfolio-based assessment protocols coupled with careful observation of performance over time.
Best Practices What are best practices for identification based on research? Currently there is a call for a new paradigm for identification, in line with the new constructs of giftedness that have been conceptualized (Passow 
This new paradigm of identification would recognize the different ways in which students display giftedness and would call for more varied and authentic assessment.
Instead of relying on intelligence and achievement test scores solely for identification, multiple criteria would be used, including more non-traditional measures such as observing students interacting with a variety of learning opportunities (Passow 
Dynamic Assessment Part of the process of non-traditional assessment involves trying to tap into fluid rather than crystalized abilities.
Dynamic assessment is one such non-traditional approach used to assess cognitive abilities that are often not apparent when most forms of standardized tests are used.
This type of assessment usually consists of a test-intervention-retest format, with the focus 35 being on the improvement students make after an intervention, based on learning cognitive strategies related to mastery of the testing task (Kirschenbaum, 1998).
Spatial Measurements Research evidence also suggests that disadvantaged learners perform better on tasks that emphasize fluid over crystalized intelligence (Mills 
By employing an assessment approach that contains a strong spatial component, disparities between scores by socio-economic status (SES) levels or ethnic group may be reduced (B. Bracken, presentation at College of William and Mary, April, 1999).
Thus using instruments like the Matrix Analysis Test and the Ravens Matrices may yield somewhat different populations of students than the use of traditional intelligence tests that emphasize verbal tasks.
The new UNIT test also offers promise in this regard as a full scale measure.
Two-stage Process Needed There is also a need to employ a two-stage process of screening and identification to ensure that appropriate measures are used in the selection of students for a program.
It is not highly defensible to use group achievement and intelligence test score data as the final arbiters for selection by merely raising the cutoff, let's say to 98%.
Many times school districts will have large numbers of students who would qualify at 95%.
To use a norm-referenced test that is grade- level calibrated to make judgements about students at the top end is not justifiable, given the problems of ceiling effect.
A better and more defensible strategy is to use off level aptitude and achievement measures to ascertain a true dispersion of the student scores in order to select the most able.
Off level instrumentation like the PLUS test, the SCAT test and the SAT all provide such information so that identification can be more precise.
Use of these instruments over the past 25 years has continued to demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency in discerning able students' range of functioning in critical domains (Benbow 
Measures Need to Match Programs The use of measures that are relevant to program emphasis is also a crucial consideration.
Using verbal measures to decide who should be in a math program makes no sense.
Ensuring that an identification system is geared to the nature of the program intervention is crucial, especially at the second stage of the process.
Thus, if the program emphasis is writing, a writing sample would be included at the identification stage, or if the program emphasis is science, a performance-based science assessment or science project portfolio would be included to make final selections.
Such authentic assessment data strengthen the case for selecting the most apt individual students for participation in carefully defined program areas (VanTassel-Baska, 1998) Age Considerations The use of identification protocols that are appropriate at different stages in the development of students is also a best practice in the field.
Early childhood identification procedures, because of age and lack of contact with the school, have to consider parental feedback more carefully, use testing data more judiciously, and consider advanced performance tasks as an important part of the process.
At secondary level, based on different organizational contexts, identification procedures need to be distinctive in respect to protocols for finding students in 36 a broader range of talent areas and for considering domain-specific approaches based on departmental courses of study.
Equity Required Finally, the identification process must be equitable in respect to selection, validation, and placement of students.
Making placement decisions based on individual profile data is also considered best practice as it allows professional judgement to be exercised rather than just allowing a numerical cutoff score on a matrix model to determine placement (Borland 
Identification will continue to present a challenge to educators of the gifted.
Yet thoughtful consideration of and reflection on various problems, issues, and current best practices can make the process more feasible and credible in school contexts.

37 Recognizing Giftedness in Young Children By Martin T. Rogers, Ph.D. and Linda Silverman, Ph.D.
The question of whether we can recognize gifted children at an early age is embedded in a larger issue: how much of a child's giftedness is attributable to nature and how much to nurture.
When the nature/nurture question was first raised, its author, Sir Francis Galton (1869), declared that nature was responsible for all of one's abilities.
In American science and education, a backlash occurred for most of the 20th century in which nurture became the primary determinant of intelligence.
Today, the pendulum has swung back to more of a middle ground, and now we recognize that nature and nurture are co-parents of intelligence.
Children show the signs of giftedness or advanced development early in life, but whether those gifts flower into high achievements in adult life is dependent upon the nurturance they receive from their environment.
Despite Madison Avenue, you just can't create a gifted child from scratch like a Yuppie pasta.
This article is based upon a comparative study of the developmental characteristics of gifted and average children (Rogers, 1986).
The information was gleaned from 77 parent questionnaires; many of the parents had detailed records of their children's development (such as baby books or doctor's records).
Contrary to the belief that all parents think their children are gifted, this study indicated that parents of average children do see their children's development differently from parents of gifted children.
In addition, the parents of the gifted tended to underestimate their children's abilities rather than overestimate them.
The two groups had similar socioeconomic backgrounds, and there were very few differences in physical development found between them.
However, there were major differences in intellectual, imaginational and social development, as well as in talents and certain personality traits.
As you read the following descriptions, remember that each gifted child is different.
Certain characteristics will apply to your child and some will not.
If you see that several of these characteristics fit your child, you may wish to seek further assessment of your child's capabilities so that you can nurture those abilities.
Early Signs of Giftedness Parents were asked to describe their children's development during the first 36 months.
One of the earliest signs of giftedness noted was alertness.
One parent said that when her child was seven months old "he was watching Sesame Street so intently that when he finally fell asleep he was still watching and just fell over backwards."
Another parent wrote, "He literally consumed his work with eagerness, wanting to learn, see, feel and touch everything, all at once."
Another early sign was long attention span.
One parent commented, "He would play games longer than playmates and get upset when they stopped playing and would leave."
A second reported, "She would work on a puzzle or a book for over a half-hour when she was only two."
Over 90 percent of the parents of the gifted saw their children as having an excellent memory.
One gifted girl knew most of "Little Orphan Annie" at age two, and another memorized the order of the books of the Bible by age four.
Well over half of the parents in the gifted group perceived their children as rapid learners.
The speed at which gifted children learned generally became apparent by the time these children were three years old.
38 One girl could count to 20 at 18 months of age, and could say her ABC's at age two.
Another mother wrote, "Before she went to kindergarten, she taught herself to paint and was writing in sentences.
When she started kindergarten, she became disillusioned."
Nine out of ten parents of the gifted reported advanced vocabulary development in their children.
Parents noticed extensive vocabulary in their gifted children by the time the children were three.
One parent kept a record of 100 words that her boy spoke by the age of 18 months.
While none of the parents of average students gave examples of any specific words, parents in the gifted group mentioned such examples as: "delicious" and "incredible" at age 2; "Rudolf was ostracized by the other reindeer" at age 2.5; "incidentally" at age 3.
One 3 year old prefaced sentences with, "Well, apparently.."
Two-thirds of the parents of gifted children found their children to be very observant.
Many parents mentioned that their children "really noticed details."
One child knew how to get to the park and the library by the age of three.
Sixty percent of the parents of the gifted said that their children were curious.
Most of the parents of the gifted observed their children's curiosity by the age of 2 1/2, about two years earlier than parents of average children.
Almost all of the gifted children were perceived by their parents as asking "probing" rather than simple questions.
At the age of 18 months, one child wondered, "What is air? How high up does it go? Why doesn't it all float away?" A three-year-old boy wanted to know how airplanes work and how people breathe.
Another three year old asked, "Will I still be me when I grow up?" Global and abstract issues occupied the minds of several of these youngsters.
One child asked detailed, probing questions about politics, nuclear war, world peace, starvation, pollution, energy and so forth.
Imagination and Creativity Imaginary playmates showed up in both groups, but only one child in the average group had more than one of these playmates while gifted children often had several of them.
One child's imaginary friends included, "Jesus as a young boy.
He appeared most often when 'B' was afraid, lonely or frustrated.
They carried on lengthy conversations."
Another child had a "family that lived in the pan cupboard: David, the father; Kookoo, the mother; and Baby Dew.
They later had another baby, Rose.
David died.
She also had a teenager sister, Hallelujah."
One parent wrote, "Being an only child, 'C' had 'Imaginary Friend' (that was his name) to play board games, etc.
Not surprisingly, friend always lost."
Over two-thirds of the parents of the gifted described their children as creative and imaginative, and about half had observed signs of vivid imagination in their children before the age of three.
One parent recollected: "At about age three, 'D' wanted a certain toy and his Dad told him to get a job and earn the money.
He immediately went to his room, colored about 10 pictures and took them around the block, selling them door-to-door.
Most people gave him 10 to 15 cents for them because of the story he told them.
We only knew our immediate neighbors, so we wondered what our other neighbors thought of us!" Academic Skills Many gifted children show an intense interest in books at an early age.
One parent reported, "at 13 months, she would drag one of us to read with her and sit fascinated until the 39 whole book was read."
By the time these children were in third or fourth grade, three-fourths of them continued to be interested in reading, compared to one-fourth of the average group.
Almost half of the parents of the gifted students describe their children's interest in reading as "intense."
A mother of a third grader wrote, "She always loved reading.
She likes Poe, Shakespearean quotes, poetry, Shel Silverstein, Charlotte's Web, etc."
A fourth-grade boy sought out "Encyclopedia Brown mysteries, anything on Einstein or a composer, especially Beethoven."
Several of the parents of the gifted mentioned that their children enjoy informational books compared with only one such reference in the average group.
Significant differences were found in the ages at which gifted children recognized letters, recognized words, sight read, and sounded out new words as compared with average children.
Almost all of the gifted group liked puzzles.
Four out of five gifted children would put together a 20-piece puzzle by the age of three.
One child could put together a 100-piece puzzle between the ages of four and five, and a very precocious youngster could solve a 500piece puzzle at the age of three "but became quite frustrated," according to the parents.
One parent gave us a fascinating account: "He could tell by the shapes how to put the puzzle together and memorized the shapes of the puzzle pieces very fast; then he would turn the pieces and work the puzzle upside-down."
About one-fourth of the gifted group showed an interest in time by the age of two.
One parent wrote, "He had a play watch when he was two and we would work on how to read it and what it all meant; he would always want to know how long things would take to do."
Another parent reported that his child became "obsessed" about knowing what time it was, what day of the week it was and the date.
Almost two-thirds of the gifted group told time in hours by the age of five.
Parents of average children limited their descriptions to the age at which their children told time while parents of gifted children often described the way their child related to time as a concept.
Though competent at telling time, gifted children often seemed to lose track of it when involved in other activities.
By age three, more than half of the gifted group could count to ten.
Consistent differences were also found between the groups in interest in math games, calculators and computers.
Five times as many gifted children as average children were reported as having a high degree of understanding of mathematical concepts.
One child was able to do double digit addition in his head in first grade and was pressing his parents to teach him division in kindergarten.
Personality Traits The majority of the parents of the gifted group described their children as having a great sense of humor.
Of the nine parents who mentioned puns, only one was in the average group.
One parent indicated that at five her daughter became a punster, joking about "symbols" and "cymbals."
Another parent said that her son appreciated adult jokes and understood them from the time he was around four years old.
He liked adults better than children from the time he was two or three.
Over half of the gifted sample showed intense reactions of frustration and seemed perfectionistic to their parents.
None of the gifted group were seen as reacting "mildly" to criticism.
Anger was the most common reaction to criticism reported.
One of the areas of perfectionism often mentioned by parents had to do with academic concerns.
Both groups said that their children tended to be more perfectionistic in areas of interest (which did not include cleaning their rooms).
Gifted or not, they still don't want to clean their rooms.
40 None of the average students chose friends much older than themselves; whereas, one-third of the gifted students chose older playmates and 15 percent chose much older companions.
Parents of the gifted group often remarked that their children tended to spend time with adults, where this was not mentioned by parents of the average group.
More than one-third of the gifted children were comfortable playing by themselves.
Parents of gifted children often mentioned that their children enjoyed spending time alone reading.
Many gifted children showed great concern for morality and justice.
Some of their parents discussed global issues with them; whereas, this wasn't mentioned by parents of average children.
Although concern for fairness was mentioned by parents in both groups, it was a predominant factor reported by the parents of the gifted sample.
Other differences found between gifted and average students in this study showed gifted students to have more talents, greater maturity, higher intensity of competitiveness in several areas, greater leadership ability, greater number and intensity of interests, and greater willingness to invest time and effort in their interests than their same-age peers.
A Final Word If your child fits a large number of these characteristics, it is a good idea to keep records of early achievements to assist later identification.
Four years old is not too young to have your child tested by a qualified examiner.
Make sure this individual is experienced with gifted children.
Because their minds are developmentally advanced, gifted children need to be given early exposure to games and activities designed for older children.
It is important to find environments that address your child's unique potential.
As one parent in our study stated, "When educational needs are met, other problems improve."
These children need time with others like themselves so that they can find true peers with whom they can relate.
Once you discover that your child is gifted, cautions must be taken so that you neither hide nor flaunt his or her giftedness.
One can lead to atrophy of abilities and the other can lead to social and emotional problems.
Early recognition and nurturance of giftedness will increase your child's chances of achieving happiness and fulfillment in adult life.

41 Parent Assessment of Giftedness: Using Portfolios to Document Talent By Dr. Bertie Kingore One ignored role of portfolios is parental assessment of children's exceptional learning needs.
The products children develop provide clear documentation of achievements and potential.
Introduction for Educators Parents have the right and need to be active partners with schools in planning and supporting the education of their children.
When identifying gifted potential, districts benefit from parental assessment information in forms other than checklists.
Portfolios enable parents to be proactive instead of reactive.
They encourage parents to be viable members in the assessment process by preparing concrete examples of children's abilities and needs.
Portfolios increase the credibility of parental assessment of gifted potential by documenting the depth and complexity of the child's work.
Documentation through products illustrates each gifted characteristic of the child that a parent has observed and increases the likelihood that a parent's perception of the child's needs is respected.
However, if parents overestimate the advanced potential of a child, school personnel can meet with the parent to share a small set of typical examples of grade-level products to compare with the parent's selections and concretely substantiate that the child's learning needs are best met through the core curriculum rather than advanced contents.
Parental development of a portfolio to substantiate a student's gifted potential is particularly needed when the child is: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Part of an educational system that values parental assessment in identifying and serving advanced learners and wants to increase the validity of that assessment.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Very young and not yet recognized as advanced by adults at school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A member of a diverse culture whose gifted behaviors are more difficult to assess in a mainstream classroom.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Advanced in one subject area but still not all.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ New to the area so the child's potential has not been demonstrated in that school.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A student in a school where the curriculum in all classes is not differentiated for able learners.
Guiding Parents' Selection of Products Parents need guidance in selecting products that are appropriate and effective.
Share your district's mission statement and definition of giftedness with parents so they can more directly match selections in the portfolio to the school's philosophical stance.
For example, when your school's program serves academic giftedness in language arts, math, social studies, and science, you want parents to include products that demonstrate advanced talents in one or more of those areas.
The product list included in the parent section is meant to prompt ideas of a wide range of products from home that might be appropriate for students' portfolios (adapted from Kingore, 1999a).
A variation of these products specifically suited to very young children is shared in Communicator (Kingore, 1999b).
42 The following factors increase the assessment value of a portfolio: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A portfolio should be an integral reflection of what a child has learned rather than artificial activities and isolated skills.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Products that effectively advocate giftedness demonstrate depth, complexity, and the ability to process and reorganize information to produce a product unique for that age or level.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The products should help substantiate that the child's interest and expertise in topics are not typical.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Products selected for a portfolio must be completed by the child without assistance.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ the likelihood that your perception of your child's needs is accepted and respected inasmuch as the products illustrate each gifted characteristic you have observed.
The parent section of this article (below) helps parents understand how to facilitate their assessment and development of a portfolio.
Specify to whom parents should share the portfolio once the product selection process is complete.
Parental Assessment: Develop a Portfolio to Document Your Child's Talents Prepare a small selection of your child's products to document learning achievements and advanced potential.
Schools want to provide opportunities for children to learn as much as they are ready and able to learn.
Your insight about your child's at home demonstrations of learning heighten our understanding of your child's needs.
A portfolio increases the credibility of your advocacy for your child by documenting the depth and complexity of your child's work.
Product examples increase the likelihood that your perception of your child's needs is accepted and respected inasmuch as the products illustrate each gifted characteristic you have observed.
How Do Parents Begin? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use a pocket folder or photo album (one-inch thickness) as a portfolio container to organize a few products your child has produced.
Photographs can be used to represent large or three-dimensional items.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Keep the portfolio small.
Six to ten items are probably sufficient to represent your child's talents.
A small sampling of carefully selected products makes a more thoughtful presentation than a large scrapbook approach.
Educators have demanding work loads and are more likely to have time to attend with interest to a sampling.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Date each product.
It is significant for authenticity and achievement level comparisons to note when each item was completed.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ If needed for clarity, prepare brief product annotations that explain how your child demonstrated a specific characteristic through that product or during the process of completing that product.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Briefly describe additional exceptional behaviors frequently displayed by your child, such as independent thinking, problem solving, and questions about topics or concepts not typically asked by children.
You are in a unique position to recount to others the process as well as the products of your child's learning.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Share written anecdotes of the child's expressed perceptions of school that suggest advanced sensitivity and unexpected points of view.
Use your child's own words to describe the challenge or lack of it in learning situations.
For example, children often 43 tell adults that they are bored.
What does your child really mean if she or he says "bored"? Record what your child says about when and how they are bored at school.
Guidelines for Selecting Portfolio Products The included portfolio products list is meant to prompt ideas of a wide range of products that might be appropriate in your child's portfolio.
Select products that are an integral reflection of what your child has learned rather than artificial activities and isolated skills.
Let the portfolio represent the main idea you want educators to understand about your child.
Products that document giftedness demonstrate depth, complexity, and the ability to process and reorganize information to produce a product unique for that age or level.
The products may substantiate your child's interest and expertise in topics that are not typical.
Products selected for a portfolio must be completed by the child without assistance for two important reasons.
Foremost, because your child's self esteem is influenced by his or her competent personal achievements.
Remaking products into adult projects risk children acquiring feelings of doubt and ambiguity about their abilities.
Secondly, the portfolio is taken more seriously when the products look child-appropriate rather than adult-level perfect.
Educators are suspicious of products that suggest extensive adult intervention.
A Final Encouragement As an advocate rather than an adversary, assume the clear stance that you want what all parents want for their children: the opportunity for children to learn as much as they are ready and able to learn.
All children deserve to learn at their optimum readiness level--even the gifted.
Be an advocate whose only motive is to insure your child's right to an appropriate education.
If we are motivated by children's best interests and not our ego needs, our efforts will usually guide us in the most appropriate direction.
Examples of Portfolio Products Product, Explanation, and Purpose Art - Art pieces should include the child's natural, creative explorations and interpretations (rather than crafts).
Art reflects development levels, interests, graphic talents, abstract thinking, and creativity.
Audio tapes - Tape the child's explanation of advanced concepts, philosophical viewpoints, musical creations, problem solutions, and ideas.
Audio tapes verify vocabulary, fluency, creativity, high-order thinking, and concept depth.
Computer - Document computer skills through applications of more sophisticated software and programs created by the child.
Computer-generated products indicate computer literacy, analysis, content-related academic skills, and applied concepts.
Dictations - Write your child's dictated explanation of a product or process.
Prompt these dictations with statements such as: "Tell me how you did that."
Dictations increase adults' understanding of the why and how of what children do.
It may indicate advanced vocabulary, high-level thinking, fluency, and content depth.
Graphs or charts - Some children produce graphs or charts to represent relationships, formulate problems, illustrate math solutions, and demonstrate the results of independent investigations.
Graphs or charts demonstrate specific skills or concepts applied in the task, high-level thinking, data recording strategies, and organizational skills.
44 Photographs - Photograph your child's math patterns, creative projects, dioramas, sculptures, constructions, experiments, models, or organizational systems.
Photographs represent three-dimensional products.
They provide a record when no paper product is feasible.
Reading level - Provide one or two examples of books or printed material your child reads independently (not material your child has memorized).
Include your child's reflection of the book to demonstrate analysis skills.
All children do not read and interpret advanced-level materials.
However, since advanced learning opportunities often require reading independence, educators are interested in students' reading levels.
Research - Gifted students usually have information and expertise beyond the age-level expectations in one or more areas.
Share examples of the independent studies pursued by your child.
Research products reveal specific interests, synthesis, content depth, and complexity of learners.
Video tape - Video tapes are wonderful ways to document performing arts and your child's learning process.
they are less applicable to substantiate academic skill development due to the equipment and time necessary to show the tape.
Limit tape entries to three or four minutes if they are to be reviewed by educators.
A video presents a significant visual record and integration of skills and behaviors.
When recording group interactions, a video can demonstrate interpersonal and leadership skills.
Written products - Provide examples of original works written by your child including stories, reports, scientific observations, poems, or reflections.
Written products may demonstrate advanced language, thinking, organization, meaning construction, concept depth, and complexity.

Strategies for Identifying the Talents of Diverse Students By Wendy Schwartz The number of programs for gifted students is increasing nationwide, largely the result of Federal grants from the Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Students Act of 1988.
Students of color and those who are poor and limited in their English proficiency continue to be severely under represented in these programs, however.
The reason is not that they are less talented than their middle-class white classmates; rather, their different experiences, values, and beliefs have prevented them from fully demonstrating their abilities through commonly used assessment instruments, and in traditional gifted education programs.
To assess the abilities of all students more accurately, educators are now using criteria for giftedness that give equal attention to academic and non-academic abilities.
Identification strategies, consisting of both traditional and non-traditional methods, often include a review of student behaviors as well as standardized test scores (Frasier, 1992; Clasen, 1993).
To better develop the talents of all students, teachers are being prepared to recognize diversity in giftedness.
To ensure that children receive early enrichment in school if their family cannot provide it, many educators are also beginning the gifted identification process at the preschool level.
Finally, to redress the past inequities in student selection for gifted programs, school districts are beginning to reach out to diverse communities to increase the access of all students to such programs.
Thus, the goal of education for the gifted has become inclusivity, not exclusivity (Frasier, 1992), although the debate over the value of gifted programs, particularly as they are thought to perpetuate student tracking practices, continues.
DEFINING INTELLIGENCE AND TALENT Traditionally, a student's intelligence was considered in very narrow terms, defined by only those abilities measured by an IQ test.
Now, educators are more likely to use the term "talent" instead of "intelligence," and to describe it as an indication of future achievement and a potential to be nurtured and developed, not a demonstrated, immutable ability.
Emphasis is shifting from what a child knows to how a child learns (Hiatt, 1991; Clasen, 1993).
There is a recognition that a great diversity exists among the gifted and their expression of talent, and, particularly, that different cultures express themselves differently.
The result is that evidence of giftedness may be overlooked by evaluators unfamiliar with a child's native culture (Frasier, 1992).
Using Gardner's (1983) concept of multiple intelligences, many indicators of talent can be found in all children, regardless of ethnicity or poverty status.
In fact, gifted people may manifest their abilities through just a single talent, such as music or mathematics.
Also, evidence of giftedness, particularly in children of diverse cultures, is often non-traditional.
50 Indicators of superior intelligence include the following (Griffin, 1992; Clasen, 1993; Coleman 
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The ability to think logically.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The ability to use stored knowledge to solve problems.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The ability to reason by analogy.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The ability to extrapolate knowledge to different circumstances.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Creativity and artistic ability.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Resiliency: the ability to cope with school while living in poverty with dysfunctional families.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The ability to take on adult roles at home, such as managing the household and supervising siblings, even at the expense of school attendance and achievement.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A strong sense of self, pride, and worth.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Leadership ability and an independent mind.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Understanding of one's cultural heritage.
ASSESSING GIFTEDNESS - IDENTIFICATION METHODS To reduce the possibility that children who do not fit stereotypical profiles of gifted children will be passed over, identifying students from diverse backgrounds for talent needs to be a multi-pronged effort by many of the adults close to them.
Involving adults from children's home, religious, and community lives in the identification process helps ensure that the availability of gifted programs is widely known.
Outreach is especially important in areas where parents may be totally absorbed by meeting their family's basic and immediate needs, and unable to focus on the possibility that their children may be gifted or to provide educational enrichment.
To facilitate identification at school, teacher training programs are now providing an education about cultural and talent diversity among gifted students, particularly to help educators understand how learning style differences can mask evidence of special talents (Balzer 
Neither poor academic achievement nor limited English language ability indicates a lack of giftedness (Shaklee 
For example, a lack of access to stimulating educational materials and experiences can impede children's early intellectual development, nutritional deficiencies can compromise their ability to concentrate, social isolation can delay their development of interpersonal skills, and trauma from a disadvantaged and dysfunctional home life can depress their overall functioning (Balzer 
The children themselves, and the adults in their lives, may not even be aware of their talents.
At an early age, possibly as a result of discrimination faced by their family or an internalization of negative attitudes of educators, even very intelligent students may develop low self-esteem and an expectation of failure that compromise their efforts to succeed (Passow, cited in Anthony, 1991).
Also, children may not have the opportunity to explore their abilities in the early grades.
Many schools do not provide a psychologically safe environment designed for 51 experimentation and self-expression--one that would allow students to make up for time lost in a home environment that did not cultivate their talents (Shaklee, 1992).
Thus, even by third grade, when it is traditional to assess students for gifted programs, some already will have adapted to an unchallenging education system, stifling their creativity and curiosity.
ASSESSMENT Schools can use students receive Hansford, 1992; TOOLS the following methods of identifying giftedness in concert to ensure that all fair consideration (Duncan 
New standardized tests have been developed to replace traditional instruments determined to be culturally biased.
They include Mercer's System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment (SOMPA), Renzulli and Hartman's Scale for Rating Behavioral Characteristics of Superior Students, the PADI diagnostic battery, and Bruch's Abbreviated Binet for the Disadvantaged (ABDA).
OBSERVATION.
Recommendations from educators, parents, and classmates can draw attention to children's talents, such as sensitivity to and insight into their environment, and an ability to manipulate the symbol systems valued by a subculture.
Soliciting such information can begin at the preschool level and continue throughout schooling.
Parents can notice their children's level of absorption in intellectual tasks and unusually varied interests and curiosity.
In fact, asking parents to consider their children's talents is a good way to encourage their involvement in enrichment activities.
Teacher observation permits the evaluation of development over time.
Teachers can consider the way students problem solve, as well as their answers.
They can see how students use their time, and how many of the talent indicators cited above apply to them.
Also, simply asking students who is the smartest or most helpful among them can prompt teachers' identification of an otherwise unnoticed child.
SELF-IDENTIFICATION.
Through biographical inventories, students can indicate talents they use in non-school settings, such as membership in a drama club.
They can describe their participation in family activities, and even indicate if they assume a management role at home.
PORTFOLIOS.
Progress over time, along with overall achievement, can be assessed by reviewing the materials that students select for their portfolios.
This allows for evaluation in areas such as exceptional learning, use, and generation of knowledge.
Also, unlike standardized tests, portfolios permit assessment of students' creativity.
To help standardize portfolio evaluation, schools can develop a list of criteria to consider, such as the complexity of the presentation.
CONCLUSION Identifying the special talents of students from diverse backgrounds is just the first step toward helping them achieve their full potential.
Educators need to develop programs for gifted students that reflect and respect their cultures and learning styles.
Doing so will demonstrate to the students that they truly belong in such programs, and will help ensure 52 their retention and success.
Teachers, along with community members (including local colleges) and the students' families, need to work together to empower and encourage all students, and to provide them with enriching educational materials and experiences and role models and mentors.

53 The Iowa Acceleration Scale By Cheryll M. Adams, Ph.D.
Controversy has traditionally surrounded acceleration for gifted students, particularly acceleration by grade-skipping.
While the reasons are many and have been discussed elsewhere in this issue, the practice has traditionally not been supported fully by most educators and administrators.
Instead, grade-skipping is seen as a last resort for gifted students when all other interventions fail.
The purpose of this article is not to discuss the pros and cons of whole grade acceleration, but to provide information about an excellent instrument, the lowa Acceleration Scale, that can assist in making these decisions for the small number of exceptional students for whom it is the best option.
The lowa Acceleration Scales (IAS) was developed by Assouline, Coleangelo, LupkowskiShoplik, and Lipscomb (1998), as a guide for making decisions about whether or not a student was a good candidate for whole-grade acceleration.
The IAS can be used for early entrance into kindergarten or first grade as well as at other points through eighth grade.
It is not suggested for use when making decisions about early entrance into college.
The IAS is not a paper and pencil assessment to which the student responds.
Instead, it is a "comprehensive guide to be used as the primary instrument in the discussion of whole-grade acceleration" (Assouline, et. al., 1998).
There is no "cut-off score;" the scores in the IAS result in categories that are then used as guidelines for decision-making and planning.
Advantages listed by the IAS' authors include: ". . .a more objective look at the student, an analysis of the major factors to be considered in the decision, guidelines for weighting the relative importance of these factors, documentation of the student's strengths and concerns, a numerical range to guide the discussion and decision of acceleration, and a standard of comparison with students who have had successful accelerations." (p. 2).
There are 11 sections to the IAS to gather such information as standardized information, prior achievement, development factors, attitude, and support.
comprehensive and discusses each of the 11 sections thoroughly.
There is a "Top Ten Issues Regarding Acceleration," that offers answers to many of concerns surrounding acceleration.
Case studies are also provided.
scores, general The manual is section on the the myths and The Center for Gifted Studies and Talent Development at Ball State University has used the IAS with several students and school corporations.
If you would like to have a student's readiness for whole-grade acceleration assessed, please contact Dr. Cheryll Adams at 1-800842-4251 (IN only), 765-2855390, or cadams@bsu.edu.

Dual Exceptionalities By Colleen Willard-Holt Gifted students with disabling conditions remain a major group of underserved and understimulated youth (Cline, 1999).
The focus on accommodations for their disabilities may preclude the recognition and development of their cognitive abilities.
It is not unexpected, then, to find a significant discrepancy between the measured academic potential of these students and their actual performance in the classroom ((Whitmore 
In order for these children to reach their potential, it is imperative that their intellectual strengths be recognized and nurtured, at the same time as their disability is accommodated appropriately.
ASSESSMENT Identification of giftedness in students who are disabled is problematic.
The customary identification methods (standardized tests and observational checklists) are inadequate, without major modification.
Standard lists of characteristics of gifted students may be inadequate for unmasking hidden potential in children who have disabilities.
Children whose hearing is impaired, for example, cannot respond to oral directions, and they may also lack the vocabulary which reflects the complexity of their thoughts.
Children whose speech or language is impaired cannot respond to tests requiring verbal responses.
Children whose vision is impaired may be unable to respond to certain performance measures, and although their vocabulary may be quite advanced, they may not understand the full meaning of the words they use (e.g., color words).
Children with learning disabilities may use high-level vocabulary in speaking but be unable to express themselves in writing, or vice versa.
In addition, limited life experiences due to impaired mobility may artificially lower scores (Whitmore 
Since the population of gifted/disabled students is difficult to locate, they seldom are included in standardized test norming groups, adding to the problems of comparison.
In addition, gifted children with disabilities often use their intelligence to try to circumvent the disability.
This may cause both exceptionalities to appear less extreme: the disability may appear less severe because the child is using the intellect to cope, while the efforts expended in that area may hinder other expressions of giftedness.
The following lists are intended to assist parents and teachers in recognizing intellectual giftedness in the presence of a disability.
CHARACTERISTICS OF GIFTED STUDENTS WITH SPECIFIC DISABILITIES Gifted Students with Visual Impairment Ã¯Â¿Â½ fast rate of learning Ã¯Â¿Â½ superior memory Ã¯Â¿Â½ superior verbal communication skills and vocabulary Ã¯Â¿Â½ advanced problem-solving skills Ã¯Â¿Â½ creative production or thought that may progress more slowly than sighted students in some academic areas 55 Ã¯Â¿Â½ ease in learning Braille Ã¯Â¿Â½ great persistence Ã¯Â¿Â½ motivation to know Ã¯Â¿Â½ sometimes slower rate of cognitive development than sighted students Ã¯Â¿Â½ excellent ability to concentrate (Whitmore 
The key to distinguishing between the two is the pervasiveness of the "acting out" behaviors.
If the acting out is specific to certain situations, the child's behavior is more likely related to giftedness; whereas, if the behavior is consistent across all situations, the child's behavior is more likely related to ADHD.
It is also possible for a child to be BOTH gifted and ADHD.
The following lists highlight the similarities between giftedness and ADHD.
Characteristics of Gifted Students Who Are Bored Ã¯Â¿Â½ Poor attention and daydreaming when bored Ã¯Â¿Â½ Low tolerance for persistence on tasks that seem irrelevant Ã¯Â¿Â½ Begin many projects, see few to completion Ã¯Â¿Â½ Development of judgment lags behind intellectual growth Ã¯Â¿Â½ Intensity may lead to power struggles with authorities Ã¯Â¿Â½ High activity level; may need less sleep Ã¯Â¿Â½ Difficulty restraining desire to talk; may be disruptive Ã¯Â¿Â½ Question rules, customs, and traditions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Lose work, forget homework, are disorganized Ã¯Â¿Â½ May appear careless Ã¯Â¿Â½ Highly sensitive to criticism 57 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Do not exhibit problem behaviors in all situations Ã¯Â¿Â½ More consistent levels of performance at a fairly consistent pace (Cline, 1999; Webb 
(Barkley, 1990; Cline, 1999; Webb 
Identification Ã¯Â¿Â½ Include students with disabilities in initial screening phase.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Be willing to accept nonconventional indicators of intellectual talent.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Look beyond test scores.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ When applying cutoffs, bear in mind the depression of scores that may occur due to the disability.
DO NOT aggregate subtest scores into a composite score.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Compare with others who have similar disabilities.
58 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Weight more heavily characteristics that enable the child to effectively compensate for the disability.
Weight more heavily areas of performance unaffected by the disability.
Allow the child to participate in gifted programs on a trial basis.
Instruction Ã¯Â¿Â½ Be aware of the powerful role of language; reduce communication limitations and develop alternative modes for thinking and communicating.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Emphasize high-level abstract thinking, creativity, and a problem-solving approach.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Have great expectations: these children often become successful as adults in fields requiring advanced education.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide for individual pacing in areas of giftedness and disability.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide challenging activities at an advanced level.
Promote active inquiry, experimentation, and discussion.
Promote self-direction.
Offer options that enable students to use strengths and preferred ways of learning.
Use intellectual strengths to develop coping strategies.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Assist in strengthening the student's self concept.
Classroom Dynamics Ã¯Â¿Â½ Discuss disabilities/capabilities and their implications with the class.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Expect participation in all activities; strive for normal peer interactions.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Facilitate acceptance; model and demand respect for all.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Candidly answer peers' questions.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Treat a child with a disability the same way a child without a disability is treated.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Model celebration of individual differences.
Gifted students with disabilities must be provided with appropriate challenges.
The personal and societal costs of not developing their potential cannot be overstated.

Standards, Policies, Laws NAGC Position Papers The Board of Directors of the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) has passed many position papers; several of which are presented here.
The Indiana Association for the Gifted has added its endorsement to the positions on Differentiation, Teacher Competencies, Ability Grouping, Mandated Opportunities, and Cooperative Learning.
NAGC: Differentiation of Curriculum and Instruction NAGC periodically issues policy statements that deal with issues, policies, and practices that have an impact on the education of gifted/talented students.
Policy statements represent the official convictions of the organization.
All policy statements approved by the NAGC Board of Directors are consistent with the organization's belief that education in a democracy must respect the uniqueness of all individuals, the broad range of cultural diversity present in our society, and the similarities and differences in learning characteristics that can be found within any group of students.
NAGC is fully committed to national goals that advocate both excellence and equity for all students, and we believe that the best way to achieve these goals is through differentiated educational opportunities, resources, and encouragement for all students.
NAGC supports the provision of appropriate quality educational experiences for all students across the spectrum of ability, background, and achievement.
The learning needs of gifted students often differ from those of other students and should be addressed through differentiation, a modification of curriculum and instruction based on the assessed achievement and interests of individual students.
To provide appropriate and challenging educational experiences for gifted students, differentiation may include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ acceleration of instruction Ã¯Â¿Â½ in-depth study Ã¯Â¿Â½ a high degree of complexity Ã¯Â¿Â½ advanced content Ã¯Â¿Â½ variety in content and form Problems occur when teachers attempt to meet the needs of gifted students by limiting learning experiences to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ offering more of the same level of material or the same kind of problem; Ã¯Â¿Â½ providing either enrichment or acceleration alone; Ã¯Â¿Â½ focusing only on cognitive growth in isolation from affective, physical, or intuitive growth; Ã¯Â¿Â½ teaching higher thinking skills (e.g., research or criticism) in isolation from academic content; 60 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ presenting additional work that is just different from the core curriculum; and/or grouping with intellectual peers without differentiating content and instruction.
Differentiation for gifted students consists of carefully planned, coordinated learning experiences that extend beyond the core curriculum to meet the specific learning needs evidenced by the student.
It combines the curricular strategies of enrichment and acceleration and provides flexibility and diversity.
Appropriate differentiation allows for increasing levels of advanced, abstract, and complex curriculum that are substantive and that respond to the learner's needs.
NAGC believes that the use of such differentiation is essential to maximize the educational experience for gifted and talented students.
NAGC further believes that appropriate educational experiences for these students are more effective when differentiated materials and activities are planned in advance and easily accessible.
NAGC: Middle Schools NAGC applauds and supports the fundamental principles of the Middle School movement.
We endorse in particular: Ã¯Â¿Â½ an emphasis on individual student needs; Ã¯Â¿Â½ teaching thinking strategies and decision-making; Ã¯Â¿Â½ teacher as facilitator, rather than knowledge-giver; Ã¯Â¿Â½ interdisciplinary curricula; Ã¯Â¿Â½ encouraging students to work at their own pace; Ã¯Â¿Â½ student membership in a "family" or home group; Ã¯Â¿Â½ extension of learning beyond the textbooks.
In addition, NAGC believes that the flexible use of grouping for instruction and accelerated programs in content fields to match students' advanced abilities and knowledge can meet the needs of gifted students while maintaining the important social goals of the Middle School movement.
NAGC: Mandated Educational Opportunities for Gifted/Talented Students The National Association for Gifted Children supports mandating services to meet the unique needs of gifted/ talented children.
Numerous studies, including the federal report, "National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent," released in November, 1993, have documented that the needs of our nation's gifted /talented students are not being met.
Programs for these students are currently often viewed as extracurricular and are available only on a limited basis in some school systems, money permitting.
The needs of gifted/talented students have been well documented by research and federal studies.
To educate all our children and allow America to compete in a global economy and all fields of human endeavor, the nation must provide an environment in which gifted/talented students, along with all of our children, can reach their full potential.
61 NAGC: Competencies Needed by Teachers of Gifted and Talented Students The National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) periodically issues policy statements dealing with issues, policies, and practices that have an impact on the education of gifted and talented students.
Policy statements represent the official convictions of the organization.
All policy statements approved by the NAGC Board of Directors are consistent with the organization's belief that education in a democracy must respect the uniqueness of all individuals, the broad range of cultural diversity present in our society, and the similarities and differences in learning characteristics that can be found within any group of students.
NAGC is fully committed to national goals that advocate both excellence and equity for all students, and we believe that the best way to achieve these goals is through differentiated opportunities, resources, and encouragement for all students.
NAGC believes that all children deserve the highest quality of instruction possible and that such instruction will only occur when teachers are aware of and able to respond to the unique qualities and characteristics of the students they instruct.
Gifted and talented students present a particular challenge and often experience inadequate and inappropriate education.
To provide appropriate learning experiences for gifted and talented students, teachers need to possess: Ã¯Â¿Â½ a knowledge and valuing of the origins end nature of high levels of intelligence, including creative expressions of intelligence; Ã¯Â¿Â½ a knowledge end understanding of the cognitive, social, end emotional characteristics, needs, and potential problems experienced by gifted and talented students from diverse populations; Ã¯Â¿Â½ a knowledge of and access to advanced content and ideas; Ã¯Â¿Â½ an ability to develop a differentiated curriculum appropriate to meeting the unique intellectual and emotional needs and interests of gifted and talented students; and Ã¯Â¿Â½ an ability to create an environment in which gifted and talented students can feel challenged and safe to explore and express their uniqueness.
NAGC believes that these competencies, in addition to those required for good teaching and learning in general, such as modeling openness, curiosity, and enthusiasm, are necessary for teachers of gifted and talented students.
NAGC also believes that educational experiences through comprehensive programming must be available for teachers to develop these competencies.
NAGC: Ability Grouping The practice of grouping, enabling students with advanced abilities and/or performance to be grouped together to receive appropriately challenging instruction, has recently come under attack.
NAGC wishes to reaffirm the importance of grouping for instruction of gifted students.
Grouping allows for more appropriate, rapid, and advanced instruction, which matches the rapidly developing skills and capabilities of gifted students.
Special attention should be given to the identification of gifted and talented students who may not be identified through traditional assessment methods (including economically 62 disadvantaged individuals, individuals of limited English proficiency, and individuals with handicaps), to help them participate effectively in special grouping programs.
Strong research evidence supports the effectiveness of ability grouping for gifted students in accelerated classes, enrichment programs, advanced placement programs, etc.
Ability and performance grouping has been used extensively in programs for musically and artistically gifted students, and for athletically talented students with little argument.
Grouping is a necessary component of every graduate and professional preparation program, such as law, medicine, and the sciences.
It is an accepted practice that is used extensively in the education programs in almost every country in the western world.
NAGC does not endorse a tracking system that sorts all children into fixed layers in the school system with little attention to particular content, student motivation, past accomplishment, or present potential.
To abandon the proven instructional strategy of grouping students for instruction at a time of educational crisis in the U.S. will further damage our already poor competitive position with the rest of the world, and will renege on our promise to provide an appropriate education for all children.

These standards may serve as benchmarks for measuring programming effectiveness; criteria for program evaluation; guidelines for program development; and recommendations for minimal requirements for high-quality gifted education programming.
Several organizing principles guided the work of the task force, including: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Standards should encourage but not dictate approaches of high quality.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Standards represent both requisite program outcomes and standards for excellence.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Standards establish the level of performance to which all educational school districts and agencies should aspire.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Standards represent professional consensus on critical practice in gifted education that most everyone is likely to find acceptable.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Standards are observable aspects of educational programming and are directly connected to the continuous growth and development of gifted learners.
Definitions Gifted education programming is a coordinated and comprehensive structure of informal and formal services provided on a continuing basis intended to effectively nurture gifted learners.
A standard is a designated level of performance that programming must achieve for the criteria to be deemed a success (Worthen, Sanders, 
Gifted learners are "children and youth with outstanding talent who perform or show the potential for performing at remarkably high levels of accomplishment when compared with others of their age, experience, or environment" (U. S. Dept. of Education, 1993, p.3).
Minimum standards include requisite conditions for acceptable gifted education programming practice.
Exemplary standards designate desirable and visionary conditions for excellence in gifted education programming practice.

By Ginny Burney, Indiana Association for the Gifted The usual progression for parents of high ability children is to go to their child's teacher and report that the material seems too easy, that the child has already mastered the topics, or that the child is bored, losing interest in school, learning to hide his/her abilities, and learning that he/she doesn't have to apply him/herself to do well.
The teachers say they cannot move the child ahead because of difficulties that would create for next year's teacher; they may offer to do something different occasionally but they lack time for a consistent effort because of the needs of the others.
The parent seeks more help, moving up the chain of command.
The principal tells the parent what is available (or not) at different grade levels in terms of a special program.
If there is a special program, it may not be in that child's grade, or it might not be at that child's school; it may be only for enrichment and perhaps only for a few hours a week.
The superintendent points out the school corporation is not required by the state to provide any special services and funding is inadequate.
The Indiana Department of Education reports that there is no law requiring services and hence they have no authority to require the school to provide anything for the child other than grade level curriculum.
The legislature expresses its reluctance to impose requirements upon the schools.
Any new legislative efforts at instating requirements are actively and overwhelmingly resisted by school boards and superintendents unless accompanied by new funding.
The problem is that meeting the regular educational needs of high ability students has been seen as a "special" program requiring "extra" funding, not required, and therefore, optional and expendable.
What about the state? The Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) is under the direction of an elected Superintendent of Public Instruction, currently Dr. Suellen Reed.
IDOE has a Division of Exceptional Learners that is under the direction of the Associate Superintendent (currently Mr. Robert Marra) who oversees program services for students with disabilities and those of high ability.
The state is divided into nine geographic regions that each has an Education Service Center (ESC).
The ESCs coordinate many types of services, including some related to Gifted and Talented, for the school districts in their areas.
There are also four libraries in the state called Shared Information Services (SIS) that lend materials relating to Gifted and Talented to parents and teachers upon request.
The DOE distributes the money that is allocated by the legislature for Gifted and Talented.
This is a little less than $7,000,000 per year.
It is used to fund the IDOE's Division of Exceptional Learners Gifted and Talented staff, the personnel and services provided through the ESCs and the SISs, and all grants to school corporations.
When this is spread over the 90,000 identified students in Indiana, it amounts to about $78 per child, which covers all services: local, regional, and state.
School corporations may apply for a grant from the monies available; those range from about $14,000-$90,000; the average grant is a little over $20,000.
In order to receive a grant, schools must comply with certain provisions.
Their grant applications may be viewed online through the G/T website at www.doe.state.in.us/gt/.
Schools self report regarding compliance; there is no field visitation.
72 What Exactly Is the Law in Indiana? There are two areas of the law that may be of interest regarding gifted education: the code as it relates to High Ability Students and as it relates to Advanced Placement courses.

78 A Plan for Advocacy: Assessing the Local Gifted Program and Advocating for Your Child By Bonita Warrum and Ginny Burney What is offered for gifted students in your school corporation? How well is the gifted program in your child's school meeting his or her needs? What do you do if your child's needs are not being met? These are important questions, yet difficult ones to answer.
Where should you start? Before you begin, some cautionary advice is in order.
When a person begins investigating a school program and asking questions (what is the program? what is the law is in relation to that program? what standards should the program be following?), a common response of those being questioned is to wonder why.
They may feel that you are dissatisfied with the work they are doing and being critical of them.
A positive working relationship is important, and change is most likely to occur when the advocate approaches his/her task with these things in mind: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use good sense, good humor and good manners.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Be professional in your approach and respectful of others' points of view; be articulate and tactful.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Be aware of the decision-making process and chain of command in the organization, and act accordingly.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Prepare well for your meetings; be well-organized and accurate in your reporting.
Do not exaggerate and do not be emotional, but provide specific examples and anecdotes to illustrate your points.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Be calmly persistent and do not be afraid to ask questions.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Be prepared with practical suggestions and reasonable goals for progress.
Another note of caution: Don't expect changes overnight.
Advocacy is a process, not an event.
Change is possible, but it takes time.
A. Become Informed About Schools and Requirements.
An effective advocate is well informed.
1.
Know state requirements.
The state of Indiana does not require that schools provide services for high ability students, but it does make grant money available to school corporations for use in providing high ability programming.
To obtain the grant money, a school corporation must meet the requirements outlined in Indiana Rule 511.

One of the requirements is that the school corporation must maintain a document called a Level of Services Program Plan, and must make this document accessible for public review.
This document outlines the high ability services provided by the school corporation.
A complete view of Rule 511 is found at www.doe.state.in.us/gt/legislation/indianacode.html or in the preceding article by Ginny Burney. b.
Another requirement is that the school corporation have a Broad Based Planning Committee (BBPC) which serves to oversee the planning and 79 implementation of high ability programs.
Interested parents should volunteer to serve on this committee.
Whether or not you serve, you should find out what is happening on this committee.
If high ability services are not being developed and improved via this committee, contact the committee's chairperson and find out why. c.
Although there are other requirements in Rule 511, the final one we will discuss here is multifaceted student assessment.
School corporations that receive G/T grant money must identify the students that they place in high ability programs using a multifaceted assessment.
This basically means that students must be selected using more than one method or criterion, and that the process must include potential- based assessment (such as IQ), performance-based assessment (such as an achievement test), and other criteria.
2.
Gather information about your school.
Call the school corporation office and ask who the G/T Coordinator or contact person is.
Introduce yourself; tell this person that you suspect your child might be gifted and you are interested in learning more about what your school system has to offer.
a.
Learn about the district G/T Plan.
Ask for a description of the district program for gifted or high ability students.
Ask to review the Level of Services Program Plan. b. Visit the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) Website www.doe.state.in.us/gt/ for G/T grant data.
Look up your school corporation and review what they have submitted to the state department as their gifted program data.
Contact your school corporation's G/T coordinator with any questions.
c. Learn about your school corporation.
Visit the Indiana Department of Education's (IDOE) website and look at other relevant information about your school corporation.
Go to www.doe.state.in.us; click on K-12 School Data; click on Data for One School; enter your school corporation name.
Review the statistical profile, the benchmarks, and the Annual Performance Report.
Learn about your district's and school's ISTEP scores, SAT scores, Advanced Placement statistics, number of students going to college, percentage of students identified as gifted.
Compare your school and district to the top ten in the state.
Compare your school and district with other area schools and schools with similar demographics but higher SAT scores, more students involved in AP courses, and more extensive G/T programs.
The purpose of this comparative review is to determine whether or not your school district offers more or less than other area schools and other similar schools.
(Note: Even if your children are in the elementary grades, it is look at SAT and AP statistics.
A school corporation must lay the in the early grades for students to be able to take AP courses in Schools that have large numbers of students taking AP courses taking the appropriate steps in the lower grades to prepare their rigorous study.)
80 important to groundwork high school.
probably are students for 3.
Review the information and chart out for yourself what is offered and when. a.
At what grade level are children screened to determine if they might need services for high ability? Research indicates that the sooner a gifted child is identified and served, the better.
b.
Are they re-screened at higher grade levels? Children do not develop at the same rate.
Especially at the lower grade levels, a gifted child may not be identified when first tested.
This is especially true in gifted children who are not early readers.
c.
What about children who move in after the screening takes place? Are students identified at middle school or high school? All gifted students in the corporation deserve to be identified and served.
d.
What criteria are used to determine who receives services? It should be a multifaceted assessment as is required in Indiana Rule 511.
e.
What services are actually provided? Use the National Association for Gifted Children's Pre-K-12 Gifted Program Standards as a benchmark for determining the quality of the services provided.
These program standards can be found in this Resource Guide or at http://www.nagc.org/new/prekto12.htm. f. How many teachers have a G/T endorsement, meaning that they are specially trained to teach gifted students? Trained teachers and coordinators are the foundation of good gifted programs.
g. Does your school have a Program or is it merely making Provisions? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provisions are fragmentary, unarticulated, and temporary activities, which are neither followed-up in any meaningful way nor preceded by any meaningful lead-in activity.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Programs are clearly articulated and are comprised of these components: Needs Assessment, Definition, Identification Plan, Goals, Program Organization, Staff Selection and Training, Curriculum Development, and Evaluation.
(Taken from a presentation by Dr. Cheryll Adams, 2000.)
4.
Compare the information you have gathered with what you know is required.
Ask questions to fill in your understanding of the local program.
If you have questions about local compliance or even if you do not, volunteer to be a part of the local BBPC to help the program develop and become all it should be.
Remember, the goal is not to alienate school personnel, but to work with them to meet the students' needs.
B. Assess your child and his/her needs.
1.
Find out as much as you can about your child.
State law does not require that all students be tested each year, or that children be tested at all for giftedness.
If your child has not been tested at school, and you suspect that he may be gifted, pursue individual, independent testing to determine if your child is gifted.
Testing can be arranged through Ball State University, Purdue University, or through independent psychologists in your area.
Unless you have test results, all you have is a "feeling" that your child needs special services.
Usually, you will receive educational 81 recommendations along with the test results.
You can use these to discuss your child's needs with the school.
2.
Assess how well the school is meeting the needs of your child.
Listen to your child.
Is he happy with school? Does he enjoy his school work? Does he find anything a challenge? Is what he reads at home of similar difficulty to what he reads at school? 3.
Begin to learn all you can about gifted education in general.
a.
Start with a copy of the Indiana Association for the Gifted's Resource Guide.
It contains lots of basic information and tips on how to find out more.

Your personal experience matters to them.
They listen to their constituents.
Go to www.state.in.us; click on Indiana General Assembly; click on Legislators; click on How to Contact Your Legislator.
Send an email, letter or phone call.
4.
Testify before the Indiana Senate and/or the House Education Committees when legislation is being presented.
5.
Join the National Association for Gifted Children.
Their website is at www.nagc.org.
6.
Pay attention to national legislation on gifted education.
Contact your congressional representatives and let them know what your experience is and how you want them to vote.
Taking Action - Local Advocacy 1.
Advocate for overall G/T program improvement.
a.
Analyze your school corporation's strengths and weaknesses in gifted education and determine what YOU think they should do. b. Make proposals to the G/T coordinator and/or the BBPC. c.
If G/T coordinator and BBPC are not responsive, either talk to the superintendent or schedule a time to make a presentation to the school board.
When presenting your proposal, i. Be businesslike and professional ii.
Be succinct iii. Make it clear what you want iv. Include how you think it could be accomplished (action plan) v. Assess costs to implement and include an estimate in proposal vi. Include reasons for why this is needed vii.
Include an estimated timeline viii.
Obtain a copy of the mission statement, philosophy statement, or other such statement from the school corporation regarding gifted education.
If they don't have one, obtain a copy of the corporation's philosophy statement.
Look for statements regarding "challenging curriculum" or "to their highest potential", etc.
Use these statements as talking points in discussions about the needs of high ability students.
2.
Advocate for your child's needs.
a.
Analyze your child's current education program and list specific areas of concern.
83 b. Determine what YOU think he needs.
(for example, Math is not challenging enough needs more challenging math instruction.
Reading is too easy for him - needs more challenging reading instruction.)
c. Early entrance and grade skipping are valid options use them when appropriate.
d.
Be prepared to suggest various ways of achieving what you want.
(Can we use an independent math instruction program on the computer? Can we let him go to another grade level classroom for reading? Can we group the higher ability readers in his class and let them read more challenging material? Can we use curriculum compacting? Other G/T strategies?) e.
If possible, collect real-life examples of how this issue is addressed in other schools.
f. Schedule a meeting with his teacher to discuss your concerns.
Try to reach an agreement on what will be done to meet his needs.
FOLLOW-UP with a letter outlining what you have agreed to.
FOLLOW-UP if the agreed-upon actions do not happen.
PRAISE the teacher if actions are taken and are positive.
g.
If issues are not resolved through meeting with the teacher, meet with the principal, then the G/T coordinator, etc.
Follow the chain of command.
h. Hire a consultant if you need advice, support, assistance.
i. Remember that anything that happens this year needs to be coordinated with next year's teacher.
Provisions are only temporary.
What you need is an articulated K-12 G/T program in your school.
Seek first to get your child's needs met in the short term, then advocate for a long-term solution --- a quality G/T program.
3.
Follow the "Chain of Command."
a.
If dealing with your child's specific needs, start with his teacher or counselor (if applicable).
It also may be appropriate to work with the building principal.
b.
If dealing with general G/T program issues, start with G/T coordinator.
c. Broad Based Planning Committee (BBPC) d. Superintendent e. School board f. Indiana Department of Education (DOE) g. Governor h. Hire a consultant if you need assistance.
4.
Follow these advocacy tips. a.
Take plenty of notes during and after phone conversations and meetings.
Include date and persons in attendance.
b. ALWAYS follow-up in writing.
If your school principal just said on the telephone that he will have the counselor give your child a screening test, then send him a follow-up letter stating what you agreed to. c. Always pin down timing on action items.
If your child's teacher says that she will get a more challenging math book for him, ask her when she thinks she can have this completed.
Then follow-up if the timing is not met.
84 d. Understand grading implications.
If special accommodations will be made for your child, how will that work affect his grade? Will the grade on his report card be based on how he does on the advanced material? Or will he, instead, "test out" of the grade level material and receive an "A" for mastering that material? 5.
Be prepared for these common roadblocks.
a.
"We can't let your daughter work ahead in math.
If she gets into next year's material, what will she do next year?" Coordination from year to year can be as simple as communicating to the next grade level teacher where the child is in her math skills and math curriculum.
The next teacher can take up where the other left off.
An articulated G/T program for the whole school, however, is the best solution, rather than individual provisions.
b.
"We can't let your son go to the 2nd grade classroom for reading.
They have reading at a different time than the 1st graders."
Find out what the 1st graders are doing during 2nd grade reading.
Perhaps he can miss it or make up that work during 1st grade reading.
Perhaps there are other 1st graders who are advanced they could be grouped during 1st grade reading time.
Or, perhaps alignment of schedules for subjects across grade levels is a good topic of discussion in the BBPC, if it would allow students to work at the level they need.
c.
"We do not let children skip a grade or begin Kindergarten early.
It is not good for them socially."
Research is very clear on this subject.
Grade skipping or early entrance is an excellent strategy for helping to meet gifted children's needs, especially in the absence of a quality gifted education program.
Experts say highly gifted students will require two grade skips throughout their education years.
Research indicates that children who skip a grade or enroll early do not suffer social problems but, on the contrary, benefit from being with children who are more their level academically and mentally.
d.
"We can't do anything special for your child---this is a public school."
Become familiar with what other public schools in your area and across the state are doing.
Be ready to propose what you want done and how it could be accomplished.
Volunteer to help, if you can.
e.
"We don't know how to test your child."
Every textbook has tests at the end of units.
Ask that your child be allowed to take the end-of-unit tests in the subject areas in question.
This is especially easy to do in math.
For language arts, perhaps the child would be permitted to read selected material from the text and take the tests on the reading.
Standardized tests are also available and can be administered to determine a child's IQ or achievement level.
f.
"We don't have any money in the budget to provide these special services."
Note first that you feel that your child has a right to have his educational needs met, not simply if they have special money earmarked.
Then note that gifted students' needs can be met without additional cost.
Self-contained classrooms can be developed which simply designate one of the existing classrooms in a grade level as the gifted classroom no additional teachers are needed.
Cluster grouping, curriculum compacting these provisions do not cost anything, but do require the teacher to be knowledgeable about these 85 strategies.
Suggest that the teacher use Shared Information Services or the Education Service Center to obtain "how-to" materials on meeting gifted students' needs in the regular classroom.
Suggest, in addition, that the school corporation actually needs a program instead of individual provisions.
6.
Consider other options.
a.
Homeschooling or partial homeschooling b. Private school or pay tuition at another public school c. Distance learning d. Move Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Summary - Key ideas Your child's education is your responsibility.

High ability students are defined as those students who have exceptional abilities and are capable of high performance.
High achieving students use their abilities to demonstrate high performance in one or more subject areas.
The number of studies related to high achievers and high ability students was meager when compared to the number of studies related to low achievers, but some direction can be gained from them.
1.
Not all high ability students are high achievers and not all high achievers are achieving in line with their talents and abilities.
School achievement fails to match achievement potential for more than half of the nation's gifted and talented students.
2.
High ability students who achieve in line with their potential are more likely to have high self-esteem, increased confidence and motivation, and decreased levels of anxiety.
3.
It is sometimes difficult to recognize exceptional talents or abilities due to a student's culture or family circumstances.
4.
Family, student, and school characteristics influence the achievement of high ability students, but no characteristic absolutely determines level of achievement.
Each student's needs must be considered individually.
5.
Negative peer pressure related to being exceptionally bright can keep high ability students from doing their best.
6.
College preparatory tracks in high schools, even when enhanced with Advanced Placement courses, do not provide content that is challenging enough to maximize the talents and abilities of the nation's brightest students.
7.
Of the theories advanced for why high ability student in the United States fail to reach their potential, the ones that seem to have the most merit are the following: a.
The current reform movement with its emphasis on ensuring that all students master a common set of standards provides little or no incentives for assisting high ability students to advance beyond the standards.
b. Many educators believe that it is inequitable to provide additional resources to high ability students to enable them to become even more academically advantaged. c. Curriculum in the United States is a mile wide and a half inch deep.
8.
In addition to being able to learn more rapidly and understand concepts at a higher level than other students once they attend class, high ability students typically know 87 9.

35 to 50 percent of the curriculum before they even enter the class.
In most classrooms, these students have a great deal of "free" time.
A differentiated curriculum, ability grouping, moderate grade skipping, and special schools or programs do seem to have positive effects on the achievement of high ability students.
The most common service offered to high ability students is a pull-out program at selected grade levels for a few hours per week.
Usually, there is little continuity, attention to individual student talents, or in-depth study of topics in these pull-out programs.
Therefore, study results show little or no advantage to participation.
Learning preferences differ among the gifted and talented, depending on the intelligence area.
They also differ between the gifted and non-gifted.
In general, high ability students prefer independent study, discussion, and lecture to cooperative learning and small-group instruction.
Curriculum experts in the United States are studying the curricula in higher achieving countries and making modification to the U.S. curriculum, based on the studies.
Beginning School Mathematics is a promising program, resulting from an Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) study, which many believe could challenge all students.
In this program, fewer topics are studied in more depth.
High ability students are often not taught the importance of commitment, hard work, and positive attitude, unless their talents are in music or athletics.
It is easier for students to acquire these attributes when they are engaged in stimulating learning activities and are taught to evaluate and adjust their own learning processes/strategies.
Staff who are skilled in instructing high ability students are extremely important to the success of these students, since curriculum adaptations are generally left up to the teachers.
Unfortunately, almost two-thirds of current elementary teachers have no training in teaching highly able students.

Developing Programs for Students of High Ability By Sandra L. Berger As educators undertake the task of program planning to accommodate the diverse abilities students bring to school, they are faced with a bewildering array of choices.
In education for students who are gifted, a variety of theories and models have been developed.
Instructional methods and materials of all types are presented with enthusiasm, each claimed to be "ideal" for students of high ability.
To make sound decisions, educators need to understand the components of an effective educational program for these students.
WHAT CONSTITUTES AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM? A program "is part of the mainstream of education and doesn't rise and fall with public opinions" (Morgan, Tennant, 
It is a comprehensive, sequential system for educating students with identifiable needs (The Association for the Gifted [TAG], 1989); is often designed by a curriculum committee; and is supported by a district or school budget.
Like literature and mathematics programs, programs for students with high ability are assumed to be integral parts of a school curriculum.
Teaching strategies may change, but the question of whether or not they should be a part of the curriculum is never raised.
A distinction should be made between programs for students who are gifted students and provisions for these students (Tannenbaum, 1983).
"Provisions are fragmentary, unarticulated, and temporary activities, which are neither followed-up in any meaningful way nor preceded by any meaningful lead-in activity" (Morgan, Tennant, 
For example, a teacher with vision and energy might recognize that a particular student needs to have his or her curriculum modified and decide to provide special activities.
However, unless there is a commitment on the part of the school system to continue meeting the student's needs and to offer similar opportunities to other able students at each grade level, it does not constitute a program.
When budgetary cuts have to be made, enrichment provisions become expendable.
WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM? An effective program comprises eight major components.
These are described in the following paragraphs.
Needs Assessment.
A program is an integrated curriculum response to the educational needs of a group of students.
Therefore, a logical first step is to determine what needs should be met.
Need is defined as the discrepancy between the current status and a desired status and indicates a direction in which an individual or school system wants to move.
An effective needs assessment enables educators to gather information about the nature and instructional 89 needs of the students and the resources of the school or school district.
Information about community attitudes and teacher skills may also be gathered.
Borland (1989) has provided a list of useful questions that might be asked, possible sources of information, and ways to obtain it.
Definition of Population.
A clear definition of the population serves as the foundation of a program.
The definition should be based on information gleaned from the needs assessment and state and local requirements.
It should address specific abilities and traits possessed by persons of high ability.
In his 1971 Report to Congress, Marland (1972) included a definition that is well known for its diversity and usefulness.
Updated in 1981 (P.L. 97-35, the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act), this definition has provided guidance to many states.
Other programs are based on a multidimensional view of intelligence (Gardner, 1983; Sternberg, 1985).
However, a local frame of reference gleaned from the needs assessment is equally important.
Identification Procedures.
The purpose of identification is to locate students whose needs are not being met by the core curriculum, evaluate their educational needs, and provide them with an appropriate program.
Identification procedures must be consistent with the definition in local use and should measure diverse abilities.
Identification is generally divided into several phases that might be conceptualized as a pyramid.
The base of the pyramid involves the entire student body and is typically called screening.
As the process evolves, the population becomes smaller.
The apex of the pyramid comprises the students who will participate in a program.
A wide variety of instruments and methods are used as the pyramid narrows.
Student records and portfolios, parent and teacher referrals and recommendations, anecdotal evidence, student products, group tests, and individual tests are just some of the ways information is gathered throughout the school year.
The identification process should be ongoing and articulated with curriculum options.
Program Goals.
The goals of a program should be written as clear policy statements of what the district will do to respond to the needs of the target population.
They should be stated broadly and may refer to desired student outcomes.
Outcomes should reflect the assessed needs of the students.
Since program goals should be made available to the public, they should be stated in easily understood language.
A comprehensive plan might also state program objectives and suggested activities.
Borland (1989), Clark (1988), Maker (1982), VanTassel-Baska and colleagues (1988), and other textbook authors have provided examples of justifiable program goals and objectives.
Program Organization and Format.
Organization and format refer to decisions on how students will be grouped for instruction, where instruction will take place, how often instruction will occur, who will provide instruction, and who will be responsible for the program and the administrative organization.
Like other program components, organization and format are derived in part from the needs assessment.
The choice of format(s) involves a number of complex decisions regarding effective delivery of educational services and includes fiscal considerations.
The central question is, "Which format(s) will best serve the needs of the defined population(s)?" Special magnet schools, pull-out programs, a school within a school, full-time self-contained classes, resource rooms, effective grouping 90 arrangements based on specific needs, and mainstreaming are just some of the available options (Cox, Daniel, 
Staff Selection and Training.
Selection and training of staff are crucial to the success or failure of a program for students of high ability (Renzulli, 1975).
But how can an administrator select the people who will ultimately inspire students and others? Researchers have consistently identified effective teachers as those who "are all things to all people."
No definitive profile of the ideal teacher for these students has been published to date.
However, interest in and eagerness to work with students who are curious and highly able are essential.
As with other program components, staff selection and training should relate to the needs of the target population.
If students are transported to a central location, they need a teacher who has had some experience with self-contained classes.
Above all, teachers in programs for students who are gifted should have a demonstrated understanding of these students (TAG, 1989).
If teacher selection precedes curriculum development, the teacher will have a critical influence on what will be taught.
Because good programs for students of high ability often grow, it is useful to have a core staff who can model effective teaching and collaboration for new teachers.
Curriculum Development.
The most effective curriculum includes substantive scope and sequence and is based on the needs of the target population (TAG, 1983; VanTassel-Baska et al., 1988).
School systems that purchase packaged programs should consider whether or not they are sufficiently rigorous, challenging, and coherent.
Appropriate curriculum produces well-educated, knowledgeable students who have had to work hard, have mastered a substantial body of knowledge, and can think clearly and critically about this knowledge.
Maker (1982) has explained how to differentiate curriculum for students who are gifted in terms of process, content, and product.
Her discussion enables educators to develop appropriate objectives based on the school system's core curriculum.
VanTassel-Baska and colleagues (1988) have provided theoretical bases, specific procedures, and practical applications.
Program Evaluation.
The evaluation component is critical because it allows a school system to reassess student needs and determine the efficiency and effectiveness of its various program components (Callahan, 1983; Callahan 
Evaluation should be both formative (ongoing) and summative (final outcomes).
Evaluation enables a school system to make midcourse corrections and answers the question, "Is this program doing what we want it to do?" REFERENCES Borland, J. H. (1989).
