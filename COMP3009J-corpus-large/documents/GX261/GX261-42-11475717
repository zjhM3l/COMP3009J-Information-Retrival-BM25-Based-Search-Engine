DAIRY MARKET NEWS CHANGES AND UPDATES In most industries and businesses, changes in operation occur which require change for the future.
At Dairy Market News, changes are occurring.
Additional market information will be carried to inform those in the dairy industry making day-to-day decisions.
Upcoming changes in cash trading of dairy commodities at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are spurring changes here at Dairy Market News.
CME CASH TRADING Effective September 1, weekly cash cheese trading will go to daily cash trading (10:45-11:00 a.m.).
Nonfat dry milk will also begin daily cash trading on September 1 (11:25-11:30 a.m.).
Details of these trading sessions and potentially future changes will be carried to keep the dairy industry abreast of the most recent trading activity.
To facilitate this expanded information, the format of our report will be changing.
Please bear with us during this transitional time as the format may change from week to week until a pattern can be established that will adequately report trading information.

Barrel cheese increased 1 1/4 cents to $1.4925 and 40# blocks are unchanged at $1.6575.
BUTTER: The market tone remains firm, but unsettled.
Butter production across the country varies, but generally is lower.
Lower production is being attributed to less available cream, strong demand for milk for bottling purposes, and producers trying to maintain low workable inventories.
Stocks of butter are reported to be in close balance for current needs.
Butter continues to clear from Western producers to buyers in the Midwest and East.
Overall buying interest is fair with most orders being placed for short term need.
Inventory control continues to be at the fore front of most producer and handler agendas.
CHEESE: The cash cheese market is steady on blocks and firm on barrels.
Cheese production is trending lower due to lower milk production and stronger Class I demand now that schools are reopening.
Demand for cheese ranges from slow to fair.
Mozzarella sales are increasing, typical for this time of year when students head back to classes.
Producers continue to approach cheddar aging programs with caution and concern.
FLUID MILK: More schools are opening across the country this week, thus milk to fill bottling pipelines is in strong demand.
School openings will continue until after the Labor Day holiday.
Bottlers and milk handlers anticipate logistic problems for the next week or so until all schools are back in session and the upcoming holiday is past before things settle down.
Milk shortages are typical for this time of the year, thus milk is moving from one area to another to supplement local production.
The Southeastern part of the country is pulling large volumes of additional milk into that area from as far away as Wisconsin.
Another factor influencing milk demand this week is hurricane Bonnie.
The Southeast Coastal area from Virginia to Georgia is bracing for potential problems.
Handlers, processors, and farmers are making contingency plans for power outages and how milk will be stored, picked up, or diverted to other plants.
Panic consumer buying is also common prior to adverse weather conditions.
The fluid cream markets remain firm.
Production schedules at many butter/powder plants are lighter as milk is being directed toward strong Class I sales for bottling and away from Class III.
DRY PRODUCTS: Nonfat dry milk markets are firm with prices unchanged to generally higher.
Stocks of powder range from in close balance to fully committed.
Strong Class I sales, DEIP sales, lower milk production, lower solids' levels in milk, and improved domestic sales, all together are creating a tighter NDM market.
Buttermilk powder markets are also steady to firm.
Production levels are lighter and producers' stocks are generally low.
Churning schedules are lighter and demand for condensed buttermilk is fairly good which reduces drying schedules.
Whey markets are steady to firm.
Stocks are in close balance.
Demand is fairly active, although buyers are working off inventories before reordering.
Cheese and whey production levels are often lighter as more milk is moving to Class I needs and milk production declines seasonally.
CCC: During the week of August 24 - 28, CCC purchased 475,113 pounds of NDM from the Midwest, but cancellations of previously offered Western powder totaling 1,747,010 pounds were also reported.
COLD STORAGE (NASS): U.S. cold storage holdings for butter on July 31, 1998 total 50.8 million pounds, 16.1% less than June and 40.6% less than July 1997.
Natural American cheese holdings total 468.1 million pounds, 4.1% more than June 1998, but slightly lower than July of last year.
Nonfat dry milk holdings at the end of June total 192.0 million pounds, 11.0% heavier than June 1997.
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (BLS): The July 1998 Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all food is 160.5, up 2.2% from July 1997.
The dairy products index, at 148.2, is up 3.4% from a year ago.
The July to July changes in selected dairy products are: fresh whole milk +2.7%, cheese +2.9%, and butter +35.4% ****SPECIALS THIS ISSUE**** DAIRY MARKET NEWS CHANGES AND UPDATES (YELLOW PAGE) CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (PAGE 2) JULY COLD STORAGE HOLDINGS (PAGES 7-8) CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE CASH TRADING LST = Last Significant Transaction BUTTER ON FRIDAY, AUGUST 28, 1998 (CARLOT UNIT = 40,000-42,000 LBS.)

WEST Western butter differentials are showing some strength.
Bulk butter demand remains good, but it does lack some of the aggressiveness of the past few weeks.
Butter continues to leave the region and move to the East.
East butter production is lower as much of their milk is moving into the Southeast to fill school milk pipelines.
Production in the West is lighter due to less cream available and milk supplies declining seasonally.
Both food service and retail accounts continue to be rated as good.

Buyers continue to look to other regions of the country to secure additional volumes of butter and are finding that asking prices are higher.
Current retail and food service orders remain surprisingly good.
Food service orders, especially in resort and vacation areas, are declining seasonally which is typical as the summer vacation season winds down.
Although prices are higher at the retail level, consumers continue to purchase butter at fairly good levels.

* DAIRY MARKET NEWS, AUGUST 24 - 28, 1998 -4FLUID MILK AND CREAM VOLUME 65, REPORT 34 EAST Weather and milk supplies are the major points of discussion in this week's Eastern fluid milk market.
Hurricane Bonnie is poised to make landfall somewhere on the Southeast Coast and this is having a few different affects on the market.
There is panic buying of milk in a wide area along the Coast from Georgia to Virginia where Bonnie may come ashore.
Also, handlers, processors, and farmers are making contingency plans for power outages and how milk will be stored, picked up, or diverted to other plants.
Temperatures are again very high throughout much of the Southeast and it is taking its toll on the cows and the milk flow.
In the Northeast, the weather has been hot, but not having too much effect on the milk flow.
Contacts in all areas report a very tight supply situation and, when milk can be found, finding trucks to haul it is increasingly difficult.
Most schools are open in Florida and a large majority are already open in the rest of the Southeast.
In the Middle Atlantic area, schools are starting to open, but most will start next week.
In New York and New England, most schools will open just before or just after Labor Day.
Florida handlers are importing 216 loads of milk this week.
This equals the number for the same week a year ago.
Exact figures are not yet known, but contacts' reports total another 135 - 140 loads moving into other Southeastern states.
Some did state that at midweek they were still looking for another 30 - 40 loads.
Those bottlers not already filling the school lunch pipelines will soon begin.
Also, some are operating on heavier schedules to meet the good retail demand in locales where Bonnie is predicted to hit.
Elsewhere, retail sales of bottled milk remain sluggish.
The condensed skim market is firm.
Supplies, like fluid milk, are tighter and some suppliers are having difficulty meeting all their commitments.
Prices, however, are unchanged to a little higher within the range.
The fluid cream market is also firm as supplies tighten.
Most butter/ powder plants are shipping milk to the Southeast and their plant operating schedules are generally lighter.
A few operations have little milk to process.
Demand for cream is good and prices are higher again this week.
Multiples are mostly unchanged, but the butter price at the CME continues to move higher.
Ice cream production and sales are mostly unchanged.
Cream cheese output is also steady, but high cream prices are influencing spot purchasing decisions.
Churning activity is mostly light.

Overall milk production is declining seasonally.
The hot temperatures of the past few weekshave moderated, thus the accelerated rate of production decline has slowed.
The demand for spot loads of milk was strong and prices were reported to be ranging $2.00 - $5.00 over class/MCP.
Cream prices continue to increase following butter cash trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Milk volumes range from in close balance for needs to short of desired levels.
At this time, milk orders are erratic and, in instances, deliveries for later in the week are being cancelled.
Bottlers and milk handlers anticipate logisitic problems for the next week or so until all schools are back in session and the upcoming Labor Day holiday is past.
Besides the milk shipments reported, July pool receipts of milk in California total 2.247 billion pounds, down 1.1% from last year.
Cumulative pool output for the first seven months of the year total 15.5 billion pounds, up 2.0% from the same period in 1997.
The blend price, at a fat test of 3.52%, is 41 cents higher than June at $14.39.
The percentage of receipts used in Class 1 products is 23.22%.
The July quota price is $15.53 and the base and overbase prices are $13.83.
These prices are 48 cents higher than last month and $2.75 higher than July 1997.
Milk production remains flat at seasonally low levels in most of the milk producing areas of the Southwest.
The heat and humidity of recent weeks have subsided in local areas, but the effect on the milking herd is still being felt.
Load averages are about steady, but solids' levels are steady to slightly higher.
Milk continues to move within the area to fill in local shortages.
School milk needs are being filled as schools begin and milk is being shipped to fluid plants.
Cream supplies are adequate.
Multiples are holding mostly steady.
Demand from ice cream accounts is still quite good although contacts are waiting for the normal seasonal slowdown to begin.
Hay prices in California are often lower and more buyer price resistance is developing.
Cow numbers are indicated to be expanding in response to higher milk prices and low feed costs.
Milking cows are also being kept in the milking stream longer.
Dairy heifer and replacement prices are increasing.
Warm and dry conditions continue to prevail over the Pacific Northwest.
The direct stress on the milking herd is minimal.
However, feed rations and earlier weather stress are causing milk tests to be quite a bit below normal or anticipated for this time of year.
While concentrate prices are extremely favorable, hay prices and palatability issues are causing ration balancing issues to develop.
Producers are looking at adding heifers with the anticipated very good milk-feed price ratios that are likely in the near future.
Heifer prices are responding by moving higher on a weekly basis.
Contacts are wondering if the number of good quality heifers might not limit the growth potential in milk production this fall and winter.
Dairymen are holding onto cows that normally would be heading to slaughter because of the very low slaughter cow prices and the likely record high milk prices this fall.
Weather conditions are very moderate in Utah and Idaho.
Days are warm, but nights are very cool.
The milk flow is good for this time of year.
A number of manufacturing operations are implementing or studying plant expansions to handle what is expected to be a very strong milk flow next spring.
Milk producers have contracted most of their concentrate needs for this milk production season at very favorable milk prices.
Hay quality is average to above average on current offerings.
Prices are $10-20 less than last year.
Quite a bit of hay is moving within the region and to out of area locations at this time.
