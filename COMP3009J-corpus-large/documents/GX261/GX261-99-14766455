Issue: when do you not let the public know about submerged archaeological sites? Issue: Use charts to ID blank areas that have been unexplored.
Issues: Seafloor topography - mapping should be derivative of exploration rather than the focus; work with other NOAA offices; multi-beam area for multiple exploration efforts Issue: Storing of data Issue: Resource mapping should be in public domain Notes: #6 should be discussed in the context of these other information needs.
