Nuclear Safeguards and Security Program Mission Provide domestic Nuclear Safeguards and Security for the protection of nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, nuclear facilities, and classified and unclassified information against theft, sabotage, espionage, terrorist activities, or any loss or unauthorized disclosure that could endanger our National Security or disrupt operations.
Physical Security provides cost-effective plans, policies, and technical solutions to ensure that nuclear weapons, special nuclear materials, classified information, and key Department facilities and personnel are adequately protected from evolving threats.
The Nonproliferation and National Security Institute is a national asset for education, training, support services and professional development throughout not only the Department of Energy (DOE), but also other federal, state, local and international agencies.
The Nuclear Materials Accountability Systems maintain real-time, reliable, and complete information on DOE nuclear materials that are subject to special control and inventory procedures.
Foreign Visits, Assignments, and Travel provides and implements Departmental foreign interactions policy by managing two DOE-wide databases to control, track, analyze, and approve the suitability of granting access by foreign nations to DOE sites; and to control, track, approve, and account for official foreign travel on behalf of DOE.
The Office of Operations Support directs the DOE Operations Centers, providing support to Headquarters emergency response operations and maintains and operates the Department's Emergency Communications Network (ECN).
The Office also maintains a comprehensive program to ensure continuity of essential Departmental functions under all contingencies in accordance with Presidential Decision Directive 67, "Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations."
Classification/Declassification prevents adversaries from acquiring weapons of mass destruction or damaging the nation's energy infrastructure.
This is accomplished by developing policies to identify information warranting protection or control in the interest of national security; by reviewing documents using these policies before they are made available to the public, to ensure that no classified or controlled information is compromised; and by examining documents that have already been made available to the public, to ensure that if they contain classified/controlled information, they are withdrawn and not further disseminated.
Protection of government property, classified matter, and personnel is provided to the National Capital area through the Headquarters Security program.
Program Strategic Perform ance Goals CM5-1: Develop policies and strategies to protect national security and other critical assets entrusted to DOE, deploy technological solutions to enhance security, protect Headquarters personnel and facilities, and provide other specialized security activities.
Performance Indicators # Effective, clear, and comprehensive security strategies and policies for DOE-wide application to protect national security and other critical assets entrusted to DOE.
# A secure work environment for Headquarters facilities in the national capital area.

Significant Accomplishments and Program Shifts # The development of advanced safeguards and security technologies has resulted in the modernization of numerous protective measures for the Department, as well as the ability to mitigate new and emerging threats that otherwise represent critical vulnerabilities.
Technology and Systems Development Accomplishments are: Â· Rel ease d Ad vers ary Timeline Analysis System (ATLAS) Version 2.0, providing users the ability to identify critical protection elements and perform collusion analyses; demonstrated the techniques required to chemically harden existing entry control points.
Â· Performance tested physical security equipment against the DOE Design Basis Threat and emerging threats to make sound procurement decisions and provide quality performance data for security system modeling tools.
Â· Transferred the Access Delay Command and Control System to a commercial vendor to allow applications of "high penalty" activated barriers with a very secure and reliable control system.
Â· Delivered an emergency egress radiation system that provides isotopic identification screening at secure/emergency exit points to prevent the unauthorized removal of special nuclear materials.
Â· Provided a low-cost, safe chemical tagging system to detect the theft or unauthorized removal of high value or sensitive items at facility portals.
Â· Developed a new, rapid, automated software system for determining accurate uranium and plutonium quantities that remains in pipes and ducts in DOE facilities.
This capability provides a rapid determination if buildings are below criticality limits as well as reduce costs associated with decontaminating and decommissioning buildings.
Â· Demonstrated a technique for implementing gamma-ray spectroscopic imaging on-line in a nuclear facility for continuous inventory of plutonium in an operating process, significantly reducing shut-down time and operator radiation exposure.
Â· Provided a measurement capability to accurately measure Plutonium-238 (Pu-238) in Pu samples with elevated levels of Pu-238 which is currently unmeasurable; developed a neutron imaging technique for very-dense heterogeneous uranium and plutonium materials, saving the time and effort required to use alternative approaches as well as reduce inventory differences.
Â· Delivered an in-vault plutonium mass confirmation system that operates on battery power, eliminating the need to make separate measurements using gamma spectrometers, calorimeters and/or coincidence counters for Pu samples.
# Since 9/11/01, the DOE Nonproliferation and National Security Institute (NNSI) doubled its training capacity due to increased requirements of the protective force, Homeland Security and countering terrorism.
Firing range and classroom instruction are at 100% of maximum capacity.
Protective force student attendance is up 75% from FY 2001.
In FY 2002 NNSI serviced, in classroom and in a field environment, over 18,000 individuals worldwide.
In the preceding twelve months, NNSI trained an additional 280 new Basic Security Police Officers for DOE, 400 FBI agents in hazardous materials response, 1,025 foreign national police officers for the Department of State, and assisted DOE Headquarters with Second Line of Defense initiatives in Russia and the Former Soviet Union states.
Finally, the firing ranges must be maintained or they will be subject to being closed due to safety and environmental problems.
The government has a $40 million investment in these training programs.

# The Classification/Declassification Review Program continues to ensure that publically released government documents do not contain classified or controlled information that would assist adversaries in acquiring weapons of mass destruction or damaging the nation's energy infrastructure.
This is accomplished by reviewing documents before they are made available to the public, to ensure that no classified or controlled information is compromised; and by examining documents that have already been made available to the public, to ensure that if they contain classified/ controlled information, they are withdrawn and not further disseminated.
In FY 200 2 DO E wi ll r evi ew ap pro xim ate ly 114,000 pages that include: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests; Executive Order (E.O.)12958, Section 3.6, Mandatory Review; litigation discovery responses; as well as newly written DOE documents.
Additionally, DOE will: (1) audit approximately 6,000,000 pages of historical documents potentially embedded with Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data that were declassified by other government agencies under E.O. 12958, section 3.4 before the page-by-page review requirement of P.L. 105-261 was enacted; and (2) quality control examine another 1,800,000 pages of historical documents that were declassified after the page-by-page review requirement of P.L. 105-261 was enacted.
Finally, DOE will examine over 500,000 pages of its own historical records for declassification under E.O. 12958.
Section 3.4.
From these examinations, it is expected that in FY 2002 DOE will find that approximately one half of these documents (from the FOIA requests, mandatory review, litigation discovery responses, and newly written DOE documents) contain in part classified and controlled information.
This information will be saved from compromise.
Additionally, it is expected that DOE will identify approximately 1,000 pages of RD and FRD inadvertently compromised by other government agencies under E.O. 12958, section 3.4; and DOE will be assessing the resulting damage to national security.
The E.O. 12958, section 3.4 compromises are reported quarterly to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and to the Congress.
# The DOE Information Security program continues to provide support to the Department in analyzing and deterring major incidents involving the compromise of classified information.
This includes expansion of the computer forensics capability to support investigations and prosecutions of unauthorized disclosures of classified information; enhancement of the e-Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (e-FOCI) registration and analysis capability; improvement to the security incid ent tr ackin g and an alysis capab ilit y (ITAC); and expansion of the Operations Security and Technical Surveillance Countermeasures program tools.
# The Office of Security enhanced DOE's management of foreign interactions during FY 2002 by adding two international programs to the existing program for granting and controlling access to DOE sites by foreign nationals.
These include the transfer of Official Foreign Travel Policy and the Foreign Travel Management System functions from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, and the transfer of the DOE Exchange Visitor Program from the Office of Policy and International Affairs.
These transfers, although in process prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, provide the Office of Security the opportunity to improve management and control of the security-related aspects of DOE's foreign interactions, and to assume a leadership role in DOE's Homeland Security responsibilities.
The Foreign Interactions Traini ng Acad emy (FITA) became operational, delivering training to enhance program effectiveness in all aspects of foreign visits, assignments, and travel throughout the DOE complex.

# Responsibility for the funding of costs associated with radioactive waste processing for the New Brunswick Laboratory has been transferred from the Office of Science to the Office of Security in FY 2003.
# The Office of Headquarters Security Operations continues to provide a safe and secure working environment for Departmental employees and protect classified and sensitive unclassified informati on through a variety of enhan ced securit y measures.
Add itional fu nding provi ded through the Fiscal Year 2002 Supplemental Appropriation supported the introduction of facility upgrades related to access control, alarm and video surveillance and the deployment of uniformed security personnel.
Modifications to the facility air handling system allows better control in the event of an emergency shutdown and the installation of public address systems within the facilities is a crucial upgrade for aging edifices.
The ability of the program to monitor attempts to circumvent access controls has been improved through additional armed patrols, technical monitoring to detect explosive materials and vehicle pop-up barriers, bollards and reinforcements to existing property boundaries.
The Office completed 1,701 clearance actions, processed 6,689 classified visits and made access eligibility recommendations on 415 Sensitive Compartmented Information cases.
The Headquarters Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Team conducted over 40 services in direct support of Capitol Hill, the Office of the Secretary and the Office of the Administrator, NNSA.
# In FY 2002, the DOE Operations Center was transferred from the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Emergency Operations, budgeted under the Weapons Activities appropriation, to the Office of Security's Operations Support Program.
# DOE's Continuity of Government (COG) and Continuity of Operations (COOP) programs was transferred from DOE's Office of Emergency Operations to the Office of Security.
# The Departmental COG program provides staff and operational support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to the National Emergency team in support of the Nation's national security program, and liaison to the White House Military Office.
The COOP program is involved in evaluating and determining the Department's obligations for continuation of essential Federal government operations.

Classification/Declassification Resources Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives The Department of Energy (DOE) has a unique, statutorily based responsibility to implement the Government-wide program to classify and declassify nuclear weapons-related technology (classified as Restricted Data).
DOE is also responsible for implementing the requirements contained in Executive Order 12958 to classify and declassify other information that is critical to the national security (classified as National Security Information).
To fulfill these responsibilities, the mission of the Classification/Declassification program is to develop (1) Government-wide policies and technical guidance to identify nuclear weapons-related information that warrants protection and (2) DOE-wide policies and guidance to identify other information that is critical to protecting the national security.
This critical program is a cornerstone of the United States nuclear nonproliferation and security program since an asset cannot be protected until it is identified as requiring protection.
Consistent with this mission, the Classification/Declassification program funds support service contractors at Headquarters and management and operating contractors in the field who provide highly technical support through: Â· Assisting in the development of general policies, procedures, and guidance to ensure that classified and controlled information is identified consistently by personnel within the Department and other Government agencies.
Conducting appraisals of DOE, including NNSA, organizations and visits to other Government agencies to ensure they are conforming with these policies, procedures, and guidance.

Security Investigations Program Mission The Security Investigations Program funds background investigations for all Department of Energy (DOE) Federal employees and contractors who, in the performance of their official duties, require access authorizations for Restricted Data, National Security Information, or certain quantities of special nuclear material.
Security Investigations are required in order to be in compliance with Section 145 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 710; and Executive Order 12968.
The Department is required to utilize either the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as a source of personnel security investigations.
Program Strategic Performance Goal CM5-1: Develop policies and strategies to protect national security and other critical assets entrusted to the Department of Energy (DOE), deploy technological solutions to enhance security, protect Headquarters personnel and facilities, and provide other specialized security activities.
Performance Indicator Specialized activities to protect Departmental facilities, nuclear weapons, special nuclear materials, classified information, and personnel.
Annual Performance Results and Targets FY 200 2 Res ults Conduct approximately 22,756 personnel security investigations and reinvestigations for the Dep artment of Energy.
FY 2003 Targets Conduct approximately 22,475 personnel security investigations and reinvestigations for the Dep artment of Energy.
FY 2004 Targets Conduct approximately 24,743 personnel security investigations and reinvestigations for the Dep artment of Energy.
Significant Program S hifts # # The price of investigative products has increased approximately 3% a year due to a rise in operating costs.
In order to ensure that the number of access authorizations (personnel security clearances) is consistent with mission requirements, the number of "Q" access authorizations has gradually increased since FY 2001 and is expected to continue rising due to heightened security requirements following September 11, 2001, and DOE's revised Design Basis Threat.
Other Defense Activities/Security Security Inv estigations

FY 2004 Congressional Budget
Â·
In response to heightened security concerns (Post 9/11), the DOE complex will continue increasing the number of Security Police Officers in FY 2003, thereby creating a need for more initial investigation funding.
#
In FY 2004, the "Q" reinvestigation workload is projected to be significantly higher (approximately 2,422 cases) than budgeted for in FY 2003 due to the cyclical surge in the fiveyear reinvestigation requirement.

Site Description Operations Offices The Security Investigations budget provides funding to the personnel security offices to pay for background investigations conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for DOE Federal employees and contractors.
Background investigations are required for personnel who, in the performance of their official duties, require access to classified information or certain quantities of special nuclear material.
The investigation is one of the tools used by DOE security personnel to determine if an individual will receive a DOE access authorization (personnel security clearance).
Washington Headqu arters Headquarters receives funding for background investigations and the associated costs for maintaining the DOE Integrated Safeguards and Security (eDISS+) personnel security databases.
The eDISS+ initiative consists of a set of interrelated databases, associated client applications, and web pages that provide a mechanism to automate the processing and tracking of access authorization requests Department-wide. eDISS+ also allows electronic communications between DOE operations offices, and the transmission of investigative requests from DOE operations offices to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
Oak Ridge Op erations Office The Oak Ridge Operations Office receives funding for background investigations and the associated costs for maintaining the DOE Test Center/Accelerated Access Authorization Program (AAAP).
The AAAP expedites the placement of urgently required personnel through processing a "Q" interim access authorization prior to completion of the standard background investigation.
Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, provides DOE with technical support for conducting research related to the security investigation process including the quality, utility, and completeness of the product.
Funding includes a review of the Department's Accelerated Access Authorization Program (AAAP), other agencies' interim clearance processes, and its relationship to the security investigation process.
