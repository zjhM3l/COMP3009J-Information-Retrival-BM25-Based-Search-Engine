Who We Are The Legislature created the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC) in 1973 after a series of gambling related scandals.
Five citizens are appointed by the Governor, with the consent of the Senate, to act as part-time Commissioners, for a single six-year term.
Once appointed, a Commissioner can only be removed for cause by a subcommittee appointed by the Chief of the Supreme Court.
This structure ensures the Commission maintains an arm's length distance from the political structure.
Four members of the Legislature act as ex officio members.
Ex officio members do not vote, except for purposes of approving or amending tribal gaming compacts.
The Commission appoints a director, who appoints agency staff.
Of the nearly 190 full-time positions authorized, over 95 are commissioned law enforcement officers, responsible for enforcing the gambling laws.
The Commission is the second oldest and third largest gambling regulatory agency in the country.

Problem Gambling Services The WSGC has contracted with the Washington State Council on Problem Gambling (Council) since 1991 to provide services, including public education, training for mental health professionals, and staffing for a toll-free hotline.
Between 1991 and 2002, the annual amount of the contact varied from $60,000 to $150,000.
The contract now covers costs related to a helpline, at approximately $25,000 per year.
State law requires licensees to post the Council's helpline number and include it as part of nonprofit bingo advertising.
In 2003, legislation was passed which provided express authority for the WSGC to contract with qualified entities, such as the Council, to provide gambling awareness training and services.
We are currently working with the Council to identify appropriate services and funding.

TRIBAL GAMING In the fall of 1988, President Reagan signed into law the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA).
This Federal Act confirmed the rights of Tribes to conduct gaming on Tribal lands through agreements with the state (Tribal-State Gaming Compacts) and established a statutory framework for the regulation of Indian Gaming.
IGRA requires the state to negotiate in good faith with Indian Tribes to provide the opportunity to engage in casino type gambling activities that are allowed in some form in the State of Washington.
The Tribes are only allowed to engage in these activities through a compact with the State.
The Director has been delegated the responsibility to negotiate these compacts and the Commission jointly regulates these activities with the Tribes.
The Commission's licensing division certifies tribal casino employees, tribal gaming agents provide on-site enforcement and regulation, and undercover agents circulate through the casinos.
There are 29 federally recognized Tribes in Washington.
27 of those Tribes have successfully negotiated a Tribal-State Compact to offer Class III Nevada-style gaming.
Of those Tribes, 17 are currently operating one casino and the Puyallup Tribe is operating two casinos for a total of 19 Tribal casinos in the state.
Since 1992, the state has certified over 16,000 individuals to work in the Tribal casinos; over 6,300 of these individuals are currently certified.

HOUSE-BANKED CARD GAMES In 1997, legislation passed authorizing Nevada-style card games, such as Blackjack, in commercial card rooms.
Prior to 1997, commercial card rooms were limited to card games in which customers played among themselves, such as poker.
The house was not directly involved with the game.
A card room operator could profit from the game, by collecting a fee from players.
Since 1997, over 100 house-banked card rooms have been licensed.
New card rooms continue to open as others close.
The average number operating is 80, employing over 6,200 licensed card room employees.
The number of applications pending varies between ten and fifteen.
A house-banked card room can operate up to 15 tables and betting limits are capped at $100.
Most locations in Western Washington are operating 12.5 tables.
In Eastern Washington, the average is 9.6 tables.
Both are slightly down from last year.
Commissioner Ludwig served four years in the state legislature and is a former three-term elected prosecuting attorney for Benton County.
Robert Berg has been with the Commission since 1998.
He oversees Licensing Investigations, the Electronic Gambling Lab, Tribal Gaming, Field Operations, and the Special Investigations Unit, which performs undercover work to investigate illegal gambling crimes.

TRIBAL MACHINE GAMING Tribal Lottery System From the outset of gaming compact negotiations, there was disagreement between the state and Tribes on whether machine gambling was legal in Washington.
In 1994, in an effort to resolve this, several Tribes, then-Governor Lowry and Attorney General Gregoire asked a federal court to determine what types of gambling devices, if any, were permitted under Washington State law.
In 1997, the court ruled slot machines were not legal, but other devices may be permitted.
After a year of negotiations between the State and twelve Tribes, a Compact Amendment was approved for machine gambling that was modeled after the Washington State Lottery's scratch ticket games.
They look like a slot machine; however, unlike a slot machine, the Tribal Lottery Machines are linked to a central computer and the winners are pulled from a pool of pre-determined winners.
Each Tribe is allotted 425 machines in the first year, and up to 675 machines after that.
Tribes may lease or purchase the rights to additional machines from other Tribes and can operate up to 1500 or 2000 machines, depending on the compact.
Currently, Tribes operate Growth of Tribal Lottery System over 14,000 machines.

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BANNING GAMBLING Under State law, the Gambling Commission has exclusive authority for the licensing and regulation of gambling activities.
Cities and counties may prohibit any and all gambling activities, but may not change the scope of activities allowed by a gambling license.
Since house-banked card rooms were introduced in 1997, a number of jurisdictions have banned card rooms.
Authority to zone card rooms in certain areas, and allow existing card rooms but prohibit new ones (grandfathering) has been the subject of much debate.
At this time, we are aware of the following restrictions in city/county ordinances relating to card rooms: Bans: 42 Zoning Restrictions: 9 Moratorium: 1 Grandfather: 7 Grandfather with sunset clause: 4 There have now been a few cases interpreting this law.
The Division 1 Court of Appeals struck down the City of Edmond's ordinance which had grandfather and sunset clauses and Pierce County Superior Court ruled in favor of a card room and enjoined the county from enforcing the grandfather clause in their ordinance for five years.
