Appendix A Market Diffusion Interview Materials, Summaries, and Results This appendix contains materials used to complete the forecasts of technology penetration for each of the seven tissue engineering projects we analyzed in this study.
For the four in-depth case studies listed in Table 1-1, we conducted more in-depth case studies than for the remainder of the projects.
For the in-depth case studies, we interviewed physicians to obtain data for the Bass diffusion model, as explained in Section 2.
For the remainder of the companies, we collected diffusion estimates for the Bass model from the companies representatives.
A.1
INTERVIEW MATERIALS Figures A-1 through A-4 contain the clinical profiles we developed and provided to physicians prior to the interviews.
We did not identify the company, either on the profile or during the interview.
Figure A-5 is a sheet of questions that we sent to the physicians along with the clinical profile.
It was designed to prepare the physicians to answer our questions.
Figure A-6 contains the informal interview guide that we used while interviewing the physicians over the telephone.
Table A-1 provides information about the physicians we interviewed.
These physicians were recommended to us as experts in the treatment of the relevant diseases by ATP-sponsored companies, by associations such as the American Diabetes Association, or by other physicians.
A.2
DATA COLLECTED Table A-2 contains the data that we collected from the physicians and company representatives for input to the model.
For some of the projects, the physicians identified and provided market penetration estimates for a number of different populations.
In these cases, we divided the eligible population into these segments and developed weighted averages for input to the Bass diffusion model.
For example, for the project Biopolymers for Tissue Repair, the total eligible population was 73,875; 33,825 adults and 40,050 children.
Expert 1 forecasted a market cap of 25 percent for adults and 75 percent for children as his estimate for the market cap.
Therefore, we used 38,494 as his forecast of the market cap for this technology.

Clinical Profile for Human Stem Cell and Hematopoietic Expansion Systems Many patients with dose-sensitive cancers are treated with high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation.
To enable the patient to survive this treatment, patients are treated with stem cell therapy to repair the damage to their hematopoietic system.
In many cases, the stem cells are harvested from the patient prior to the myelotoxic treatment or from a donor via peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection.
PBPC requires the use of mobilization drugs that may have side effects for the patient or donor.
Assume that a new method for stem cell harvest is now available.
This new method involves extracting a small quantity of bone marrow (a single aspirate) in a doctors office under local anesthesia.
The aspirate is placed in a Cell Production System (CPS) which is fully automated for growing stem cells outside the human body.
This method may reduce the probability that certain tumor cells will be reintroduced via the graft.
Please examine the clinical profile below and think about the current stem cell harvest techniques versus the new treatment we described above.
Then, answer the questions on the following page.
Expected cost of new treatment per patient, including all resources required for stem cell harvest: Likely alternative treatment and treatment cost: Risks/side-effects:
No more than $12,000.
Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization.

Clinical Profile for Structurally New Biopolymers Derived from Alpha-L Amino Acids Currently, fractures of the shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand, knee, and ankle are fixed with metallic devices.
Some fractures are also fixed with bioabsorbable materials.
Assume that new devicespins and screws made from a newly developed bioabsorbable materialhave just become available.
The new bioabsorbable material is made from a novel synthesis of tyrosine that avoids the problems associated with acids produced by the breakdown of existing bioabsorbable polymers.
Also, the new pins and screw are stiffer than the current bioabsorbable alternative.
The primary application for the pins and screws is orthopedic repair (fracture fixation).
The new bioabsorbable pins and screws are intended for use in the following types of fractures:

Clinical Profile for Disease Treatment Using Living Implantable Microreactors Currently, most insulin-dependent diabetics are treated with daily insulin injections.
Assume that a new treatment has just become available that uses porcine pancreatic transplant cells encased in microspheres to achieve tight glycemic control in insulin-dependent diabetics.
The cells permit glucose, nutrients, electrolytes, oxygen, and bioactive products to pass but block immunocytes involved in transplant rejection.
As the cells cease to function, the patient will require a booster injection of new cells.
The cells are intended for treatment of all Type I diabetics and Type II diabetics who require daily insulin injections.
Please examine the clinical profile below and think about the current treatment for insulindependent diabetics versus the new treatment described above.
Then, answer the questions on the following page.
Expected cost of new treatment per patient: Likely alternative treatment and treatment cost: Expected outcomes of new treatment:
$12,000 for initial implant and $6,000/year for booster implants, which are required once or twice a year.
Daily insulin injections: $1,666/year The new treatment will achieve equal or superior outcomes as realized in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).
The DCCT demonstrated the benefits of tight glycemic control for insulindependent diabetics.
Results of the trial showed: Z 76% reduced risk of eye disease Z 50% reduced risk of kidney disease Z 60% reduced risk of nerve disease Z 35% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease Z Improved quality of life Z Reduces glucose monitoring to once a week Z Eliminates daily insulin injections Z Automatic insulin response to glucose Z No immunosuppression required Z Simple to administer

KEY FINDINGS FROM INTERVIEWS We highlight key findings from the physician interviews by project.
Stem Cell Expansion Z In addition to autologous bone marrow transplants (BMTs), physicians believed this procedure would be useful for patients receiving multicyclic subablative chemotherapy and umbilical cord stem cell transplants.
Z
Two physicians stated that there are technical barriers to using this treatment for allogeneic transplants due to graft rejection, graft versus host disease, and the inability to restore blood cells to the level they need to be.
Z
Barriers to this treatments market success cited by physicians interviewed include the cost of capital equipment for health maintenance organizations (HMOs), hospitals, and BMT centers; the ease of training; and physicians belief in the procedures reliability to grow stem cells.
One physician said that a disadvantage of the
A-12
Appendix A Market Diffusion Interview Materials, Summaries, and Results
treatment is that once the cell expansion has started, the cells will have to be used on a given date and cannot be saved until a later date, in the event that a patient is unable to undergo the transplant.
Z
Physicians and CEOs of hospitals and managed care organizations were cited as being most influential in determining whether the treatment will become widely used.
Z
Physicians stated that the possibility of reducing tumor cells in a graft will be extremely important in determining the treatments market acceptance; however, this factor will not be important in terms of modeling health outcomes.
Biopolymers for Tissue Repair Z Physicians noted the differences between the pediatric orthopedic market and the adult orthopedic market.
The pediatric market has a high removal rate for pins (95 percent) because physicians are reluctant to leave pins in growing bone.
However, the removal rate for adults is closer to 10 to 15 percent.
Z
One physician said that the only adult population this would be applicable for is healthy adult patients with lowload nondiaphyseal fractures.
Z
Barriers to this treatment that were cited included physicians concern, even if it is misinformation, about possible reactions to bioabsorbable materials versus inert metals; the ability to use bioabsorbables mechanically as easily as metals are used; the fact that biodegradable devices may not have the same degree of interfragmental compression; and the higher cost of bioabsorbable materials.
Z
One surgeon said that surgeons will be most influential in determining whether these devices become widely used they find the devices comparable to the metal devices.
if
Living Implantable Microreactors Z Z Physicians believed that the eligible population is identical to that for VivoRxs technology.
The biggest barriers cited to this treatments widespread use are the fact that human and porcine islets are good reservoirs for retroviruses, and the long-term effects of porcine retroviruses are not known.
Cost was also cited as a barrier.
Proliferated Human Islets Z Physicians confirmed that the eligible populations for this treatment are Type I diabetics and 10 percent of Type II diabetics (those who are insulin-dependent).
The only group not eligible for this treatment is women who are pregnant or considering getting pregnant.
A-13
A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies
Z
One physician believes that children and young adults who are beyond puberty
and
have already shown some
complications related to diabetes will be the ideal group for both VivoRxs and BioHybrids treatments, since the medical community will do anything to prevent further complications in such young patients.
Z
One physician stated that if we can clone human cells, these should be better than porcine cells; however, there is a big reservoir of porcine cells, so availability should not be an issue.
Z
The biggest barriers cited to this treatments widespread use include
Z
cost, which far exceeds current diabetes therapy, especially for young parents with young (less than 10 years of age) diabetic children; availability of tissue for transplantation; the government, which may be overly restrictive in regulating the number of patients able to receive either therapy (VivoRx or BioHybrid); pharmaceutical companies that are large producers of insulin and insulin-related products; concerns about unrecognized malignant cell transmission; and long-term immunological effects of this type of transplantation.
Physicians predicted that the American Diabetes Association and professional endocrine societies will be influential in determining how widespread this treatment becomes.
One physician believed it will be primarily patient-driven, because many patients will be willing to pay more for improving lifestyles (i.e., reduction in glucose monitoring).
