Appeal No. 1998-0876 Application 08/269,703 We refer to the Final Rejection (Paper No. 6) and the Examiner's Answer (Paper No. 9) (pages referred to as "EA__") for a statement of the Examiner's position, and to the Brief (Paper No. 8) (pages referred to as "Br__") for Appellants' arguments thereagainst.
OPINION Claims 1, 2, and 4-6 "Anticipation is established only when a single prior art reference discloses, expressly or under principles of inherency, each and every element of a claimed invention."
RCA Corp. v. Applied Digital Data Systems, Inc., 730 F.2d 1440, 1444, 221 USPQ 385, 388 (Fed.
Cir. 1984).
Independent claims 1 and 6 recite a computer or retail terminal comprising "a first portion having a housing including a display" and "a second portion having a housing different than the housing of the first portion and coupled to the first portion including a processor" (emphasis added).
The specification discloses that terminal 12, corresponding to the first portion, is supported above the checkout counter and terminal 14, corresponding to the second portion, is located within the checkout counter (specification, p. 7).
-4This
Appeal No. 1998-0876 Application 08/269,703 allows the terminal to have a small footprint on the checkout counter (specification, p. 3).
Appellants argue that Vassigh
teaches an integrated terminal and fails to teach a computer or retail terminal with first and second portions having different housings.
The Examiner finds that the "first
portion having a housing including a display" reads on the display 22 and the "second portion having a housing different than the housing of the first portion and coupled to the first portion including a processor" reads on the housing 24 (FR2; EA4).
We hold that the Examiner's findings as to Vassigh are erroneous.
Vassigh discloses that figure 1 shows "a
perspective view of the data terminal device . . . generally indicated by the number 20 which includes a touch screen panel 22 mounted in the top surface 24 of the terminal device" (col. 3, lines 50-54).
Figure 2 shows the touch screen
panel 22 in the top surface 24 of the terminal device with the electronics 34 and 38 for the panel located within the terminal device.
Even if we read the phrase "a housing
different than the housing of the first portion" broadly, the terminal device does not have a different housing from the -5-
Appeal No. 1998-0876 Application 08/269,703 display 22 because the display 22 is an integral part of the terminal device housing.
While figure 1 seems to show a
display placed on the terminal device, that is, a display housing placed on a terminal device housing, there is no description of figure 1 having two separate housings. would be improper to resort to speculation in our fact finding.
See In re Warner, 379 F.2d 1011, 1017, 154 USPQ 173, It
178 (CCPA 1967) (it is improper to resort to speculation or unfounded assumptions to supply deficiencies in the factual basis for a rejection).
The Examiner could have easily found
a reference to show separate housings for the display/keyboard and processor but elected to rely on a strained interpretation of Vassigh with which we do not agree.
Thus, the Examiner The
errs in finding claims 1 and 6 to be anticipated.
rejection of claims 1, 2, and 4-6 is reversed.
Although we have reversed the rejection of claims 4-6, we nevertheless comment on other errors in the Examiner's rejection.
Claim 4 recites a "card reader within the housing The Examiner finds that Vassigh
of the first portion."
discloses a card reader 72, figure 16, coupled to the processor (FR3).
Appellants argue that the card reader in -6-
Appeal No. 1998-0876 Application 08/269,703 Vassigh is not located in a housing different from the housing containing the processor.
Figure 16 shows the buttons on the
touch screen display during the payment process; it does not show a card reader and certainly does not show a card reader within the first portion housing.
Figure 1 appears to show a
card reader (unnumbered) in the terminal device 20 at the upper right hand corner of the sloping front face, but this is not part of the first portion of the display.
Claims 5 and 6 recite that "the first and second keypads in combination perform a predetermined function in a plurality of ways."
This goes to the disclosed concept of
"multi-pathing" (e.g., specification, p. 2, lines 3-5; p. 5, last para.).
Appellants argue that Vassigh discloses three
types of buttons, but does not disclose more than one way that these buttons can be used to perform a predetermined function (Br10).
The Examiner finds that this limitation is disclosed
in Vassigh and points to the three different kinds of buttons in figure 9 that Appellants argued did not meet the claim limitations (EA9).
The Examiner does not answer Appellants'
argument, and gives no example of a function that is performed

in Vassigh.
Claim 3 The Examiner concludes that it would have been obvious to make the touch screen display in Vassigh using a liquid crystal display as taught in Fujita.
We agree.
Appellants' We do not find this limitation taught
arguments (Br11) fail to address the teachings of Fujita.
However, Fujita does not cure the deficiencies of Vassigh with respect to claim 1.
reversed.
Claims 7-13 Independent claim 7 recites "a terminal having a housing" and "a data recording device which must be connected to the terminal in order for the data recording device to operate . . . including a housing different than the housing of the terminal."
Appellants make the same argument as with claims 1 The Accordingly, the rejection of claim 3 is
and 6 about Vassigh not having different housings.
Examiner relies on the previous discussion of Vassigh (EA6), which we found unpersuasive as to showing different housings.
The Examiner applies Fukatsu to teach a bar code scanner, but -8-
Appeal No. 1998-0876 Application 08/269,703 Fukatsu shows an integrated terminal and, so, does not cure the deficiencies of Vassigh.
The Examiner has failed to The rejection of
establish a prima facie case of obviousness. claims 7-13 is reversed.
Although we have reversed the rejection of claims 7-13, we nevertheless comment on other errors in the Examiner's rejection.
With respect to claim 10, the Examiner has not
addressed the limitation of a stand for supporting a data recording device above a checkout counter as claimed.
With
respect to claims 11 and 13, we refer to the discussion of claims 4 and 5, supra.
Claim 14 Claim 14 recites a "signature capture device."
The
Examiner applies Norwood and concludes that it would have been obvious to modify Vassigh with Norwood so as to recognize a customer's signature (FR6; EA7).
Appellants argue that
Norwood is concerned with combining handwritten input with keyboard input in a general purpose computer system and there is no discussion of use of a signature capture device in a retail system as claimed (Br15).
-9-
Appeal No. 1998-0876 Application 08/269,703 Norwood is not a signature capture device for a retail terminal.
The Examiner provides no motivation for applying a
general handwriting recognition device to signature capture in a retail system.
The purpose of a signature capture device is
to provide a signature image, not for the signature to be recognized and converted into text.
Signature capture devices
are well known in stores such as Best Buy and Sports Authority in the Washington, D.C. area.
It would have taken little work In any case, however,
to find more relevant prior art.
Norwood does not overcome the deficiencies of Vassigh with respect to the rejection of claim 7.
14 is reversed.
Claims 15 and 16 Claim 15 recites "a lock for preventing unauthorized access to the system."
includes Claim 16 recites "a power switch which The rejection of claim

control key 30 which is said to control power on/off and cause a CPU to execute "registration" and "settlement" operations.
Appellants argue that Unno does not disclose a lock or power/standby switch as claimed (Br16-17).
- 10 -
Appeal No. 1998-0876 Application 08/269,703 We fail to see how control key 30 (col. 3, lines 41-43) can be considered a lock as recited in claim 15 and, although key 30 is a power switch, we fail to see any description of it placing the terminal in a standby mode as recited in claim 16.
Thus, the Examiner errs in the rejection of claims 15 and 16.
In any case, however, Unno does not overcome the deficiencies of Vassigh with respect to the rejection of claim 7.
rejection of claims 15 and 16 is reversed.
CONCLUSION The rejections of claims 1-16 are reversed.
