6 Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation An update on the reclamation of abandoned mine land affected by mining that took place before the Surface Mining Law was passed in 1977 Title IV of the Surface Mining Law Â­ the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program provides for the restoration of lands mined and abandoned or left inadequately restored before August 3, 1977.
Implementation is accomplished through an Emergency Program (for problems having a sudden danger that present a high probability of substantial har m to the health, safety, or general welfare of people before the danger can be abated under normal program operating procedures), and a non-emergency program.
States and tribes with approved programs carry out these responsibilities.
Abandoned Mine Land Fund ees of 35 cents per ton of surface mined coal, 15 cents per ton of coal mined underground, and 10 cents per ton of lignite are collected from active mining operations.
The fees are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund, which is used to pay the costs of abandoned mine land reclamation projects.
The fund consists of fees, contributions, late payment interest, penalties, administrative charges, and interest earned on investment of the fund's principal.
From Januar y 30, 1978, when the first fees were paid, through September 30, 2002, the Fund collections totaled $6,542,832,940.
For the same period, Fund appropriations totaled $5,007,894,164.

The Surface Mining Law specifies that 50 percent of the reclamation fees collected in each state with an approved reclamation prog ram, or within Indian lands where the tribe has an approved reclamation prog ram, are to be allocated to that state or tribe.
This 50 percent is designated as the state or tribal share of the fund.
The remaining 50 percent (the federal share) is used by the Office of Surface Mining to complete high priority and emergency projects, to fund the Small Operator Assistance Prog ram, to fund additional projects directly through state Reclamation at this West Virginia abandoned mine land site (left), eliminated 6,000 linear feet of highwall and sealed four mine openings.
To prevent future damage, an under-drain was placed along the length of the highwall to collect drainage from auger holes.
Since no topsoil was available, the spoil was direct-seeded with a special seed mix.
Today this landscape bears little resemblance to its appearance before the abandoned highwalls and spoil were reclaimed.

The term "Distribution" is now used instead of "Allocation".
Allocation refers to the "pooling" of monies collected for the AML Fund.
State and Federal share distribution amounts are based on formulas and parameters provided annually by the Assistant Director, Program Support.
The emergency program distribution amounts are based on estimates provided by the states and approved by the Deputy Director.

reclamation prog rams, and to pay collection, audit, and administration costs.
In 1991, at the direction of Cong ress, a for mula to distribute federal-share money to the state reclamation prog rams was established based on historic coal production.
Table 1 shows 2001 collections and funding by states.
The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508) extended fee collection authority through September 30, 1995; the Energ y Policy Act of 1992
(Public law 102-486) fur ther extended fee collection authority until September 30, 2004, after which the fee will be established at a rate to provide funds for the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund.
In 1992, under authority of Public Law 101-508, the Office of Surface Mining began investing abandoned mine land funds.
These funds are only invested in U.S. Treasur y Securities.
United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund Beginning in 1996, under a requirement of the Energ y Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486), the Office of Surface Mining beg an an annual transfer from the investment interest earned to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund.
This cash transfer is used to defray anticipated health care costs for eligible union coal mine workers who retired on or before July 20, 1992, and their dependents.

1940's and 50's uranium mining on the Navajo Reservation had left abandoned underground mine openings, dangerous highwalls, radioactive waste piles, and undetonated explosives.
Today, with reclamation complete, these hazards are eliminated and the site is being returned to native grazing land (above).
In the anthracite coal region of Eastern Pennsylvania, coal seam fires are common.
This fire, located under the Pennsylvania town of Centralia, periodically burned to the surface, emitting smoke and noxious fumes.
Here, smoke and fumes have killed all vegetation and started a forest fire (below).
Emergency action to remove the burning coal was required to prevent additional surface fires starting at this location.
authorizes a transfer of up to $70 million per year of the interest earned on the principal balance of the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund to the Combined Benefit Fund to defray the costs related to health care for unassigned beneficiaries.
Unassigned beneficiaries are those miners for whom no operating coal company is responsible.
If, after a typical two-year cycle, the amount of the transfer was
g reater or less than the actual health benefits, an adjustment is made to the next transfer.
The 2002 annual payment was $70 million for 16,770 beneficiaries.
Prior year adjustments increased this payment by $43.6 million.
The Department of the Interior Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-291) required an additional transfer of $75 thousand to provide refunds for cer tain qualified operators.
This payment was made in Januar y 2002.
Pursuant to ag reements, the United Mine Workers Combined Benefit Fund returned $23.3 million in 2002 which was the unused portion of the amount transferred to them in 2001 under the same Law.
The total payment in 2002 was $90.4 million.
Since 1992, when the Office of Surface Mining began investing Abandoned Mine Land funds, the cumulative investment earnings have been $706.2 million.
Cumulative transfers to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund, including 2002, have been $574 million, leaving an interest balance of $132.2 million.
Table 2 summarizes the Fund account for the past two years.
The Office of Surface Mining collects fees from coal operators through voluntar y reporting, audit, and debt collection.
In 2002, the initial rate of those reporting and paying on time was 94.2 percent.
Through follow-up and other work with the operators, the compliance rate was raised to 99.88 percent, resulting in total collections of $287,066,346 for the Fund.

States now receive amounts based on appropriated spending levels and are held accountable for using those funds in accordance with their approved abandoned mine land reclamation plans.
The Office of Surface Mining is no longer involved in cumbersome and detailed preaward scr utiny of state grant applications.
During 2002, the Office of Surface Mining awarded 96 percent of the Abandoned Mine Land grants to the states within 60 days of receiving the grant application.
Minimum Program The minimum-level prog ram was established by Cong ress in 1988 to ensure funding of existing high priority projects in states where the annual distribution is too small for the state to administer a prog ram.
During 2002, Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Mar yland, Missouri, Nor th Dakota, and Oklahoma were eligible for minimum-level prog ram funding and received such grants during the year.
Minimum prog ram funding was $1,500,000 for 2002 ($100,000 less than 2001).
The eight eligible prog rams received a total of $7,602,718 in 2002.

Cur rently, all primacy states except Mississippi have approved abandoned mine land reclamation prog rams.
In addition, the Crow, Hopi, and Navajo Indian Tribes have approved prog rams.
In 2002, the states and tribes received grants totaling $191,501,525 to car r y out the emergency and non-emergency Abandoned Mine Land prog rams.
Since 1979, when the states began receiving abandoned mine land administrative grants to operate their prog rams and constr uction grants to complete reclamation projects, $3,261,045,007 has been distributed from the fund.
Grant obligations (the amount used by the states) for 2002 are shown in Table 34.
Simplified grant funding of state abandoned mine land prog rams started in 1994.
This grant application process eliminates the requirement for separate advance approval of each reclamation
This joint Natural Resources Conservation Service/Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality project resulted from a cooperative agreement to reclaim abandoned mine sites together.
The reclamation of this site eliminated many health and safety hazards.
The public is no longer in danger and the site is being integrated back into the natural Arkansas landscape.
Groundwater degradation has been eliminated and a dangerously crooked stretch of state highway was eliminated.
This was an excellent synergistic opportunity between federal, state, and county authorities that saved the taxpayers thousands of dollars.

(Subsequent legislation has extended that date to September 30, 2004.)
Statutor y amendments contained in Public Law 101508 created a new acid mine drainage setaside prog ram that does not supersede the transfer of funds deposited under the original 1987 prog ram.
The funds set aside under the new prog ram were available for use beginning in 1996, and only to reclaim eligible priority 1 and 2 abandoned coal mine land problems.
In 2002, 11 states set aside $8,430,421.
Subsidence Insurance Public Law 98-473 authorized states and tribes with approved reclamation prog rams to use abandoned mine land funds to establish self-sustaining, individually administered prog rams to insure private property against damage caused by land subsidence resulting from abandoned underg round coal mines.
Implementing r ules were promulgated in Febr uar y 1986.
Under those rules, states receive an annual subsidence insurance g rant of up to $3,000,000, awarded from the state's share of the Abandoned Mine Land Fund.
In 2002, no subsidence insurance g rants were issued.
Through 2002, the Office of Surface Mining has g ranted a total of $11,799,058 to Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, and Wyoming for this purpose.
This abandoned mine reclamation was the Ocean Underground Mine, which began operation about 1870 (above).
During World War I, approximately 90 percent of all steamship coal used by U.S. warships came from this mine.
But, when mining was completed in the 1940's the unreclaimed site was abandoned leaving entrances to the mine open, refuse piles, and a large group of buildings.
After reclamation, all abandoned mine hazards were eliminated and the site is once again an asset to the nearby Maryland community.
This view shows the stream running through the site located on its original channel and free of sedimentation.
Prior to the Rural Abandoned Mine Land reclamation this Indiana abandoned mine site had unstable highwalls and water-filled pits (left).
Its close proximity to residential areas created dangerous conditions and resulted in the death of one young boy who fell through the frozen water.
Today, with the abandoned mine hazards eliminated, the site has been turned into an attractive resource for the community.

Federal Emergency Projects 1978 - 2002
Emerg ency reclamation projects are those involving abandoned mine land problems that present a danger to public health, safety, or general welfare and which require immediate action to eliminate the problem.
Following passage of the Surface Mining Law, the Office of Surface Mining perfor med all emerg ency reclamation; however, as prog rams were approved, many states took over emergency prog rams.
In 2002, the following states implemented emerg ency prog rams: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, K ansas, Missouri, Montana, Nor th Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Virginia, and West Virginia.
The Office of Surface Mining funds the states with emergency prog rams using federal share funds (in addition to for mula-based allocations) to complete the projects.
The Office of Surface Mining completes emergency projects in California, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Mar yland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, as well as on all tribal lands.
It is anticipated that Iowa will assume the responsibility for the emerg ency prog ram in 2003.
Investig ations of potential emergency problems (called "complaint" investigations) are undertaken by state reclamation agencies or by the Office of Surface Mining.
Potential emergency problems are refer red to the states or Office of Surface Mining from affected citizens, municipalities, emergency response agencies, and other state agencies.
Infor mation on how to report emerg ency problems can be found at www.osmre.g ov/amlemerg.htm.
Following identification of a potential emerg ency problem, a technical investigation is perfor med, usually within 48 hours, and a emergency deter mination made.
Of the 1,144 potential emergencies refer red to the states and Office of Surface Mining in 2002, 341 were deter mined to be emergencies, 786 were deter mined to be not of an emerg ency nature or not related to coal mining, and

Problems which were not emergencies; but, were otherwise eligible for reclamation are considered for high priority projects.
During 2002, states obligated $10.4 million (see Table 3) and the Office of Surface Mining obligated $10.1 million on emergency reclamation projects (see Table 13
5).
No state expenditures exceeded the Congressionally-imposed "cap" of $4.5 million which can be spent in any state within a year.
In 2002, the states and the Office of Surface Mining star ted 349 Abandoned Mine Land emergency projects in 15 States (see Table 4).
As usual, most emergencies occur red in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Kansas.

Non-Emergency Program Under Sections 402 and 407 of the Surface Mining Law, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to expend Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund monies for non-emerg ency reclamation of high priority problems that present an extreme danger to the public.
A nonemerg ency is defined in the Surface Mining Law regulations (30 CFR 870.5) as "a condition that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial har m to persons, property, or the environment."
Until 1980, when states and Indian tribes beg an to receive approval for their Abandoned Mine Land prog rams, the Office of Surface Mining administered all non-emergency reclamation.
However, since that time, state and tribal prog rams have assumed responsibility for correcting abandoned mine land problems and cur rently use 99 percent of nonemerg ency reclamation funds.
During 2002, the Office of Surface Mining initiated 11 non-emergency projects and the states and tribes initiated 306 nonemerg ency projects.
The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund also is used to reclaim problems created by non-coal mines.
To be eligible for funding, a non-coal project must be a priority 1 (threat to health and safety), or the state or Indian tribe must certify it has addressed all known coal-related problems.
Table 6 summarizes both emerg ency and non-emergency abandoned coal and non-coal mine reclamation project accomplishments through 2002.
Post-Surface Mining Law Reclamation As authorized by the 2002 appropriations, Federal Civil Penalties collected under Section 518 of the Surface Mining Law were used to reclaim lands mined and abandoned after August 3, 1977.
In 2002, the Office of Surface Mining funded two reclamation projects in Kentucky costing a total of $90,858.
An additional $156,356 in unobligated funds will be carried over for use in 2003 reclamation projects.

Appalachian Clean Streams Program The Appalachian Clean Streams Prog ram beg an as an initiative in the fall of 1994 by the Office of Surface Mining.
The Prog ram supports local efforts to eliminate environmental and economic impacts of acid mine drainag e from abandoned coal mines.
The mission is to facilitate the efforts of citizen g roups; university researchers; the coal industr y; corporations; the environmental community; and local, state, and federal g overnment agencies in cleaning streams polluted by mine drainage.
During 2002, $6.9 million was distributed to 12 states (Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mar yland, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia) and 17 acid mine drainage cleanup projects were begun.
This funding provided the incentive for other Alabama Illinois Indiana Kentucky Maryland Ohio Oklahoma Pennsylvania Tennessee Virginia West Virginia Totals

Following is an example of a successful Appalachian Clean Streams Prog ram project completed during 2002.
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection reclaimed the Bells Gap Run project using a $166,455 Appalachian Clean Streams Prog ram g rant and $337,515 from Pennsylvania's Growing Greener funds.
There were two separate abandoned mine sites included in the project.
The first site was a 110 gallon/minute discharge coming from an inadequately reclaimed abandoned surface mine.
Water was percolating through the exposed acidic spoil and seeping out at down-slope locations.
The project reclaimed the surface mine, providing surface drainage and vegetation, and constr ucted a vertical flow alkalinity producing wetland to treat the water.
The second site used an anoxic limestone drain to treat a four g allons/minute discharge from an underg round mine.
Tog ether, these two projects improved two miles of Bells Gap and Lloydville Runs.
sources to contribute to the projects, and during 2002 this funding grew to over $1.3 million.
Since 1996, when the prog ram began, 95 Clean Streams Prog ram projects have been funded by the Office of Surface Mining and 48 have been completed (see Figure 1).
A landslide above this Kentucky house (left) required emergency work to prevent further damage.
Surface and subsurface drains at the top of the hill divert water around the house.
The concrete wall will provide a solid base at the bottom of the hill and prevent future sliding.
The large pipe covered with gravel behind the wall will prevent water buildup and keep added pressure off the wall.
As the last step in the reclamation process, the entire site will be graded and revegetated.
Abandoned mine openings such as this one in Pennsylvania are extremely dangerous (below).
Partially caved in at the entrance, this example is typical of abandoned mine openings found throughout the country in areas where underground coal mining has taken place.
Abandoned sites like this should be reported so they can be reclaimed (see www.osmre.gov/ amlemerg.htm).

cooperative ag reements (totalling $214,590) were awarded (see Figure 2) and 18 projects were started.
Since 1999, 28 watershed projects have been completed.
Surface subsidence resulted when the roof collapsed in an abandoned underground mine 150 feet below a residential area adjacent to a high school in Fairmont, West Virginia.
After drilling 320 boreholes, 2,000 cubic yards of concrete was pumped into the boreholes.
The resulting concrete pillars support the mine's roof and will prevent future subsidence.
Significant on-the-ground improvement has been made by watershed projects during 2002.
For example, the Mountain Watershed Association Sag amore Mine Drainage Project located in northeast Fayette County Figure 2 Pennsylvania.

windmills pump air into the water, enhancing the process that leads to precipitation of the iron.
The second system is an underg round anoxic limestone drain that the acidic water flows through.
The limestone dissolves in the water, and raises the pH enough to cause the metals to fall out in the wetlands.

This watershed is part of the City of Altoona water supply, and the removal of the metals and acidity from the streams will reduce costs of water treatment at the filtration and treatment facility located at the downstream reser voir.
The Pennsylvania Depar tment of Environmental Protection worked closely with the Blair County Conser vation District and the City of Altoona in developing and constr ucting this successful acid mine drainag e treatment project.
As a watershed partner, the Agriculture Department's Natural Resources Conser vation Ser vice completed a watershed restoration plan in 2000.
That plan identified 119 sources of abandoned mine drainage.
Of those, ten were targeted for treatment because they contributed more than 90 percent of the total problem in the watershed.
The Sag amore Mine Drainage Remediation Project is the first acid mine drainage project completed in the watershed.
The project included the collection of underg round mine seeps, relocation and reclamation of a streamside coal refuse pile, and design and constr uction of two distinctly different treatment systems.
One system includes two large wetland areas, that treats water high in iron and aluminum; but, is "net alkaline" (no alkalinity in the for m of limestone needs to be added to cause the metals to fall out of solution).
A special feature of this system are two wind mills that operate air pumps.

Watershed Projects As part of the Appalachian Clean Streams Prog ram in 2002, $2.7 million was included in the budget to fund watershed projects with local not-for-profit organizations that undertake acid mine drainage reclamation projects.
An additional $4.4 million was contributed by outside sources.
The maximum award for each cooperative ag reement was $100,000.
These funds were primarily used for the constr uction phase of the work; however, administrative costs associated with completion of the projects were allowable.

The Office of Surface Mining contributed $107,000 of the total project cost of $358,000.
Other financial partners included the Natural Resources Conser vation Ser vice, Environmental Protection Agency, and the Western Pennsylvania Watershed Protection Foundation.
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection provides maintenance, and is an active funding and design par tner in several of the other acid mine drainage remediation projects in the watershed.
The completion of this project provided the Association and community with a successful example of what can be accomplished when people and groups work tog ether.
The project site is crossed by a rails to trails hike/bike trail, that connects several of the Indian Creek Communities.
The local school system is using the site for environmental field trips, and local youth g roups have planted trees and shr ubs along the trail.

Soccer Initiative The University of Virginia College at Wise was a 2002 U.S. Soccer Foundation grant recipient.
The Virginia Department of Mines, Mineral and Energ y completed reclamation work at the college highwall site using soil and rock to eliminate a dangerous highwall.
The bor row site was designed and reclaimed to be used as an official sized soccer field.
Also, the Virginia Department of Mines, Mineral and Energ y has partnered with the Lonesome Pine Soil and Water Conser vation District to construct a parking lot adjacent to the field.
This is one of three pilot projects that has been initiated by the Office of Surface Mining and the U.S. Soccer Foundation.
Inventory of Abandoned Mine Land Problems The Surface Mining Law, as amended by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), requires the Office of Surface Mining to maintain an inventor y of eligible abandoned coal mine lands that meet the public health, safety, and general welfare criteria of Section 403(a)(1) and (2).

The Office of Surface Mining maintains its inventor y on the Abandoned Mine Land Inventor y System, which is accessible from the web at www.osmre.gov/aml/inven/zintroin.htm.
The system creates reports on abandoned mine land accomplishments and problems that still require reclamation.
This was the eighth year the states and Indian tribes managed their own data, entering it electronically into the Office of Surface Mining's inventor y system.
In 2002, this process resulted in 1,275 records added, 4,437 modified, and 146 deleted.

As of September 30, 2002, the system contained infor mation for 17,231 problem areas, mostly related to abandoned coal mines.
(A problem area is a geog raphic area that contains one or more abandoned mine problems.
Problem area boundaries are delineated by the extent of their effect on surrounding land and water, not just the abandoned mine sites.)
Although the Abandoned Mine Land Prog ram is one of the Nation's most successful environmental restoration prog rams, with over $1.5 billion worth of coal-related high priority problems reclaimed, many projects have yet to be funded.
The inventor y of unfunded coal-related problems is reduced each year by state, Indian tribe, and federal reclamation projects.
Unfortunately, new problems are discovered as development expands into old coal mining areas and new problems arise such as subsidence and mine fires.
As of September 30, 2002, a breakdown of (Priority 1, 2, and 3) costs from the Inventor y System show over $8.6 billion of unreclaimed problems (see Figure 4).
During 2002, the Bureau of Land Management continued to store its federal lands abandoned mine inventor y in a specially modified version of the Office of Surface Mining inventor y system.
People accessing either the Office of Surface Mining or Bureau of Land Manag ement version of the system will have access to both agencies' abandoned mine land inventories.
Using the g eog raphic infor mation system capabilities, it will be possible to quer y both databases.
Future plans also include access to the U.S. Forest Ser vice and National Park Ser vice abandoned mine inventories.
Before reclamation, this 50-acre site adjacent to an active Indiana coal mine consisted of a very large abandoned gob pile and a slurry pond.
The site was the principal source of acid mine drainage that was polluting the local watershed.
The area was graded and covered with approximately two feet of shale and unconsolidated subsoil material, then revegetated to pasture and hay fields.
Costs to complete this reclamation project were shared by the mining company and the landowner, saving the public over $200,000 in abandoned mine land funds.
Reclamation Awards After more than 25 years of abandoned mine land reclamation funded under the Surface Mining Law, thousands of dangerous health and safety problems have been eliminated.
To enhance communication about achievements in abandoned mine land reclamation, the Office of Surface Mining has presented awards to those state and Indian Abandoned Mine Land prog rams responsible for completion of the most outstanding reclamation.
(See www.osmre.g ov/amlrules01.htm for a description of the awards prog ram and the 2003 r ules.)
This year five awards

were presented at the 2002 annual meeting of the National Association of Abandoned Mine Land Prog rams.
National Abandoned Mine Land 
The project included reg rading refuse, spreading 100 tons per acre of ag ricultural lime, covering the material with four feet of soil, and planting veg etation.
In addition, almost 5,000 linear feet of erosion control features were installed.
Most drainage from the reclaimed site has been directed into a small wetland that improves site aesthetics, eliminates offsite sedimentation, and enhances water quality downstream.
Appalachian Region Award -- The Mar yland Abandoned Mine Land Section of the Bureau of Mines' Kempton Coal Waste Stabilization and Doser Installation Project in Kempton, Maryland, won the Appalachian regional award for reclamation of an early 1900's underg round mine that was discharging about 3.5 million gallons of highly acidic mine drainage per day.
Discharges from a ventilation airshaft and an 18" diameter borehole had been responsible for eliminating aquatic habitat in more than 35 miles of the Potomac River.
The reclamation efforts included installing a water-powered dosing system immediately adjacent to the airshaft discharge.
In addition, a total of 160,000 cubic yards of coal refuse was removed from the Kempton Glades Wetland, designated a Wetland of Special State Concern because of its biologically unique environment.
Wester n Region Award and People's Choice Awards5 -- The New Mexico Abandoned Mine Land Bureau's Sugarite Canyon Project in Raton, New Mexico, won the western regional award for its reclamation of the Sugarite Canyon.
This reclamation stabilized sides of the steepwalled canyon, which were covered with large areas of eroding coal mine waste.
The project used a unique design that included constr uction of straw bale ter races with seedlings planted behind the straw mulch, which provided immediate control of water erosion and long-ter m stabilization of the steep slopes.
This difficult abandoned mine problem has been successfully reclaimed and no long er poses a safety hazard to visitors of the Sugarite Canyon State Park.

The first Office of Surface Mining/state cooperative agreement project started under the Surface Mining Law was the abatement of the Peach Creek refuse fire in Logan County, West Virginia.
The project contained 38 acres of burning refuse that was excavated and quenched using water from a ten-acre pond constructed on the project site.
Today, 20 years after the project's completion, the area is covered by a wide variety of vegetation and it is difficult to identify traces of the past abandoned mine land hazards.
