Page ii July, 2001 Executive Summary The Hawaii Statewide Transportation Plan rests on set of statewide goals.
These are broad objectives that can be mutually reinforcing or in apparent conflict.
In order to assure wide public involvement in updating the HSTP, the Statewide Transportation Planning Branch has conducted interviews and meeting with advisory groups.
This survey research was conducted to assess how the public at large and also potentially sensitive groups respond to the goals and their prioritizations.
The survey was fielded with 1,115 random households in the State of Hawaii between May 31, 2001 and June 13, 2001.
The survey was also conducted with 31 identified stakeholders between June 25, 2001 and June 29, 2001.
At the statewide level, reported proportions have a sample error of +/-2.9%.
All the goals were recognized as important by all respond ents.
Making sure our transportation system is designed to importance to residents of Hawaii.
Considerations for transportation in one's community were very important of one's geographic community.
Even when residents' conflict, safety was always more important than mobility keep users safe was of utmost safety and security in planning to 91% of residents, regardless planning goals are seemingly in or protecting the environment.
Making sure that different areas and transportation systems work together (80%) and making sure there is enough funding to meet transportation needs were also highly valued by residents statewide (78%).
Residents placed higher importance on issues that affect their persons directly.
Respondents felt issues such as safety and preserving quality of life should receive more attention than public policy issues such as protecting the environment, supporting the economy or public involvement.
Overall, residents were least concerned with issues that only affect a limited range of respondents such as a lack of infrastructure (mobility).
Public involvement in the planning process was not as important to residents when considering their community transportation plans (68%).
Public involvement was a more difficult prioritization.
The emp hasis on public involvement was also a distinguishing characteristic of neighbor islands.
When asked to choose between public involvement and a statewide plan, only Oahu residents chose the statewide plan.
All other islands put importance on public involvement in the transportation planning.
Making sure that different areas and transportation systems work together was much more of a concern for the residents of Oahu than neighbor island residents Protecting the environment was an important concern for many but particularly for the residents of Maui County.

Page iii July, 2001 In particular, the islands of Maui and Kauai were most adamant about considering the quality of life aspect when developing transportation in a community.
Molokai was most concerned about having enough funding to meet transportation needs.
Planners, aware of the complex issues involved in setting objectives and acting on them, often answer, "It depends" to questions about trade-offs between priorities.
However, less than 10% of the respondents cho se the in-between answers.
They see the planning issues as sensible, and as having fairly clear-cut answers.
The residents at large did not make distinctions between specific community planning and statewide planning Household with seniors, maybe due to prior experience with coordination problems, were more likely feel coordination between agencies was of high priority.
Mobility, or the ability to get around quickly and easily, was not a concern among many residents except households with seniors.
Give n that the stakeholder population was built out of people who have some connection with elderly, it is not surprising that the planning issues of mobility and accessibility were important to this group.
Quality of life is more important to the stakeholders than the general population.
Stakeholders were also more likely (94%) to put importance on making sure different agencies all work together for the whole transportation system Stakeholders would rather not see additional funds being spent on supporting the economy while the general population considers that important.
Stakeholders believe every policy issue should have additional funding.

Page iv July, 2001 Introduction The Hawaii Department of Transportation is responsible for planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining State facilities for all modes of transportation, by air, water, and land.
Coordination with other State, County, and Federal programs is maintained in order to achieve the objective.
The Department currently provides, operates, and maintains eleven (11) commercial service airports, four (4) general aviation airports; nine (9) commercial harbors; and two thousand four hundred fifty (2,450) lane miles of highway.
Four of the five major airports now serve domestic overseas carriers.
The State of Hawaii Department of Transportation is currently working on an update of the Hawaii Statewide Transportation Plan (HSTP), a policy document that will identify Hawaii's transportation goals and objectives and provide direction for the developme nt of the multi -modal programs and facilities for transportation.
This document is being developed in collaboration with the planning and transportation agencies of the four counties, the Oahu Metropolitan Planning Organization (OMPO), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
Additionally, Neighbor Island Citizens Advisory Committees (CACs) and a subcommittee of the OMPO CAC have been instrumental in assisting the project management team in this work effort.
At this stage, draft goals, objectives, strategies, and examples of implementing actions have been formulated and are being disseminated for review and comments.
Purpose and Method The plan rests on set of statewide goals.
These are broad objectives that can be mutually reinforcing or in appare nt conflict.
In order to assure wide public involvement, this survey research was conducted to assess how the public at large and also potentially sensitive groups respond to the goals and their prioritizations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Achieve an integrated multi -modal transpor tation system that provides mobility and accessibility for people and goods.
Ensure the safety and security of transportation systems Protect and enhance the environment and improve the quality of life Support Hawaii's economic vitality Achieve a statewide planning process that is comprehensive, cooperative and continuing.

Page 1 July, 2001 Objectives The objective of the survey effort were: 1.
To learn the opinions of Hawaii residents about transportation goals and their prioritization.
This effort provides a basis for understanding whether the public at large shares the views of policy makers.
2.
To hear from areas that may have been underrepresented in the initial outreach effort.
Specifically, to be able to report from selected areas that might otherwise not be represented separately, i.e., Lanai, Molokai, Puna; and to report on stakeholders involved with the elderly so we can gauge the extent to which their goals overlap with or differ from those of the population at large.
From the state goals mentioned above ten broad objectives were specifically tested in this research.

Methodology This survey makes use of a telephone interview.
The survey was conducted on 1,115 random households in the State of Hawaii between May 31, 2001 and June 13, 2001.
The survey was also conducted on 31 identified stakeholders between June 25, 2001 and June 29, 2001.
The survey was fielded us ing a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing system.
The interviewing method allows an interviewer to directly enter responses to a computer file.
The contingency patterns are automatically programmed and the interviewer is able to view the questions and answers of the survey through a computer screen.

Page 2 July, 2001 Sample Selection The sample for the survey was selected from a stratified frame, random within strata.
The procedure uses disproportionate stratification for the first level (island), and proportionate stratification for selecting telephone numbers within stems for each island.
Sample Results Table 1 presents the sampling results of the survey.
The results are based on actual sample sizes and number of completed interviews.

Households with seniors is a sample segment of the total statewide sample.
In this case, 284 households or 25.5 percent of the respondents replied that at least one person living in the household (including the respondent) was a senior, 65 years old or older.
The survey did not o versample the population or target calls in order to achieve this sub sample.
Another subset of the total sample were the number of households who live in Puna.
The final survey sample contains 67 households or 6.0% of the respondents who live in Puna.
Respondents were classified as living in Puna if their telephone prefix was 965, 966, 967, 968, or 982.
A stakeholder sample was created of members of advisory boards, directors of programs, and members of patients' councils in hospitals.
The initial inquiry ended up with about 90 phone numbers.
The actual completed interviews numbered only 31.

Page 3 July, 2001 Research Findings Introduction The Transportation Policy Survey combined three approaches to learn about citizens' views of transportation issues: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Standard questions about "importance" provided evidence that people do in fact see the issues under study as important.
"Trade-off" questions forced respondents to say which of two priorities they found more important, and whether they found it more important all of the time.
"Spending" questions provided an alternative way to estimate importance, and indicated that residents not only see an issue as important, but value government action to address the issue.
For the standard questions about importance and the spending questions, an extensive list of issues was reviewed.
On the "trade-off" questions, only a few issues could be contrasted without testing the patience of respondents.
(In fact, pretest respondents found this section to be quite easy to answer.)
The responses to the three sets of questions were highly complementary, i.e., respondents tended to proceed from much the same viewpoint in judging importance, trade-offs, and appropriateness of additional spending.
An additional step was needed to insure that responses dealt with statewide planning policy issues, not just local problems.
Residents were asked about both issues "in your community" their area of local concern, whether that is a neighborhood, a town, a region or an island and "statewide."
As discussed below, this step served to underline the difference, for residents of some Neighbor Islands, between relatively simple local planning contexts and more complex state ones.
In the following sections responses from the RDD sample of households will be discussed.
Responses from particular segments and the stakeholder's sample will be considered later.

Page 4 July, 2001 Planning Objectives for Your Community and the Whole Transportation System As illustrated in Figure 1 there is general agreement on the part of respondents that these goals set by the DOT are actually important considerations.
All planning issues received a rating of very important from more than 60 percent of respondents.
Making sure our transportation system is designed to keep users safe is of utmost importance to all residents of Hawaii.
In fact, considerations for safety and security in planning transportation in one's community very important to 91 percent of residents, 10 percent more residents than any of the other planning issues.
Making sure that different areas and transportation systems work together (80%) and making sure there is enough funding to meet transportation needs are also high valued by residents statewide (78%).
On the other hand, public involvement in the planning process is not as important to residents when considering their community transportation plans.
Only 68 percent of residents thought public involvement were a very important consideration, nearly 20 percent fewer residents than those concerned for safety and security.

Page 5 July, 2001 The State Department of Transportation has to plan improvements for all of Hawaii, not just a particular community.
Therefore, statewide transportation improvements deal with roads, highways, public transportation systems, bike paths, harbors and airports.
With this broader task to consider, one would imagine priorities and concerns would also be readjusted.
However, the residents of Hawaii clearly indicate that "what's good for my community, is good for the state".
The residents at large do not make distinctions between specific community planning and statewide planning.
Residents consider safety and security very important, significantly more residents than for any other planning issue.
Residents made suggestions such as: "IT CAN HELP IT TO BE SAFE ESPECIALLY ON THE R OADS.
BY HAVING MORE DRIVERCHECKPOINTS, AND ENFORCING TRAFFIC SAFETY" "SAFETY FIRST, MORE TRAFFIC SIGNALS, MORE POLICE ON THE ROADS TO HELP LESSEN ACCIDENTS" "SPEED BUMPS IN HAWAIIAN HOMES.
LOTS OF KIDS SPEEDING.
MORE SECURITY OR CITIZENS WATCH".
Public involvement also continues to be a less of a consideration to residents.
However, some residents do feel that public involvement is important: "ACTIVELY LISTEN TO PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY MAKE SUGGESTIONS AND CONSIDER THEIR SUGGESTIONS FROM A RESIDENT'S POINT OF VIEW" "COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT FOR NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS ARE IMPORTANT - THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION GOES ON IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD" Figure 2: "Very Important" Planning Issues Whole Transportation System safety and security transportation systems work together enough funding different agencies work together protecting the environment quality of life accessibility mobility supporting the economy public involvement 91% 83% 80% 80% 79% 78% 75% 72% 70% 67% 50% 55% 60% 65% 70% 75% 80% 85% 90% 95% Percent responding "very important" to the question: "When it comes to the whole transportation system, do you think the following issues are very important, somewhat important, not very important, or not to be considered in planning."

Page 6 July, 2001 Prioritization through Choices As the Interim HSTP notes, goals are interrelated and may be in conflict.
The survey explores the question of whether goal conflicts made decision-making difficult.
Planners, aware of the complex issues involved in setting objectives and acting on them, often answer, "It depends" to questions about trade-offs between priorities.
A striking feature of the data is that less than 10% of the respondents chose the inbetween answers.
They see questions about these transportation planning issues as sensible, and as having fairly clear -cut answers (i.e., that one goal out ranked another all the time).
Residents placed higher importance on issues that affect them directly.
Respondents felt issues such as safety and preserving quality of life should receive more attention than public policy issues such as protecting the environment, supporting the economy or public involvement.
Overall, residents are least concerned with issues that only affect a limited range of respondents such as a lack of infrastructure (mobility).
Even when resident's planning goals are seemingly in conflict, safety is always a more important consideration than mobility or protecting the environment .
Statewide, almost 9 out of 10 (86.3%) of residents felt making transportation systems safe for users to be the more important than making it possible for people to go places quickly.
Also, almost three-quarters of respondents (73%) agreed that safety was more important than protecting the environment.

Page 10 July, 2001 Coordinated Transportation Systems Planning Coordinated planning, making sure that plans for different areas and transportation systems work together, was noted as being the second most important consideration in pla nning community and state transportation systems.
In actuality, however, coordinated planning was much more of a concern for the residents of O`ahu, than for communities with less complicated transportation systems such as Lana`i and Moloka`i.
In fact, barely one - half of the residents of Lana`i (54%), stated that coordinated planning efforts as a very important consideration for planning improvements to transportation in their community.
These residents recognize that at the statewide level, coordinated planning is necessary and give this goal a higher level of importance.
Of Lanai and Molokai residents, 86 percent and 88 percent respectively, feel coordinated transportation system planning is very important.

Public Involvement Public involvement in the transportation planning process is a difficult goal to establish priorities.
In Figure 1 and Figure 2 , public involvement was considered the least important goal to the residents at large.
However, Figure 8 shows that public involvement was actually of higher concern for the neighbor island communities.

The initial inquiry ended up with about 90 phone numbers.
The actual completed interviews numbered only 31.
The number of responses, while low, will be enough to meet our basic purpose of seeing whether stakeholders and the public at large are very different.
Given that a stakeholder population was built out of people who have some conne ction with elderly, it is not surprising that the planning issues of mobility and accessibility were important to more stakeholders (84% for mobility and 87% for accessibility) than to the general population.
Quality of life was an important concern for all stakeholders as compared to only 77 percent of the general population.

Page 25 July, 2001 When stakeholders considered not only their community needs but also the statewide transportation system as a whole, their responses were much more in line with the general population.
As with the community planning issues, quality of life is still more important to the stakeholders than the general population (90% vs. 78%, respectively).
Stakeholders were also more likely (94%) to put importance on making sure different agencies all work together for the whole transportation system.
Since many of the stakeholders represent agencies or organizations that provided services to the elderly, they might have intimate knowledge of coordination problems.
