August 31, 2000 Re: Centennial Clean Water Fund/Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund/Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Fund FY 2001 Funding Cycle Final Offer List
To Interested Persons: I am pleased to provide you with the enclosed Final Offer List for the Centennial Clean Water Fund (Centennial), Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund (SRF), and Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Fund (Section 319) programs for state fiscal year 2001 (FY 2001).
Projects offered FY 2001 Centennial, SRF, or Section 319 funds are shown on the Final Offer List.
Ecology considered 221 projects for funding that were submitted during the FY 2001 application period.
Of these, a total of 82 projects will receive funding offers in the form of grants and loans totaling $93.7 million.
Projects will address water quality improvement and protection initiatives including wastewater collection, treatment, reuse, and reclamation, salmon habitat and riparian corridor improvements, sediment control, agricultural best management practices, watershed action plans, wellhead protection, stormwater treatment, environmental education, and water quality monitoring.
A Draft Offer List reflecting projects proposed for funding was released on June 30, 2000, and two public meetings were held in July to provide information on the process used for project selection.
A thirty-day public review and comment period for the FY 2001 Draft Funding Offer List and Applicant List, and the Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Draft Intended Use Plan began on July 3, 2000, and continued until August 2, 2000.
Written comments were received and a responsiveness summary identifying how the comments were addressed has been prepared and is included with the Final Offer List.
The FY 2001 Final Offer List and FY 2001 Final Intended Use Plan reflects all revisions or adjustments which have been made.
As you review the Final Offer List, please keep in mind that it reflects 12 projects which will be offered funds from more than one funding source.
Due to the eligibility of various project components and the availability of Washington State Water Pollution Control Fund loan funds, a greater percentage of projects are receiving loan funding.
Loans are becoming a more vital source of funding for water quality improvement and protection projects.
Interested Persons August 31, 2000 Page 2 The application period for the next round of Centennial/SRF/Section 319 funding (FY 2002) will be between January 2, 2001, and February 28, 2001.
I would encourage all potential applicants to begin developing their projects now so that networking with other local government groups and/or state agencies can begin as early as possible.
Ecology Water Quality Program staff in our four regional offices are available, upon request, to assist with technical considerations through the project development and scoping process.
If you have questions about the Centennial program, please contact Kim McKee at (360) 407-6566.
Questions about the SRF program can be directed to Brian Howard at (360) 407-6510 and questions for Section 319 can be directed to Dan Filip at (360) 407-6509.
Sincerely,

Responsiveness Summary For Final Offer List _______________________ FY 2001
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List
Responsiveness Summary Introduction Funding Cycle Ecology conducted a 30-day public comment period following the publication of the Fiscal Year 2001 Draft Offer and Applicant List (Ecology Publication Number 00-10-029) on June 30, 2000.
During the comment period agency staff held informational public meetings in Tacoma and Spokane.
Also, forty-six letters were received during the comment period, including requests for evaluator comments and requests for funding reconsideration.
Staff carefully reviewed and addressed all comments from applicants and from other interested parties.
Ecology staff also discovered a few minor errors and omissions.
All issues identified by staff, applicants, or interested parties are addressed in this section, with the comment summarized first and the response following.
Any resulting changes to the list are identified in the response as well as on the final offer list.
Local Prioritization Process The local prioritization process used during the FY 2001 application cycle was the second year of a pilot process.
It was similar to the first year, with certain changes and simplifications.
One major change was to use only Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIAs) as local prioritization areas, eliminating the confusing choice of WRIAs or counties.
Another major change was to allow local watershed planning groups organized under the Watershed Planning Act to act as the local prioritization group.
The third major change was a simpler and shorter list of required signatures.
More detailed information about the local prioritization process may be found in the Water Quality Program Financial Assistance for Fiscal Year 2001: Guidelines (Volumes One and two), available on request from Ecology.
Evaluation Process The FY 2001 Project Priority System and Evaluation Process was developed to provide a tool to rank all projects submitted on a statewide basis.
This ranking included both point source and nonpoint source facilities and activities project proposals (both remediation and prevention based proposals).
The system placed all project proposals on an initially equal footing based on water quality and public health criteria.
At least two Ecology staff with water quality proficiency conducted a complete review of each application: Â· Â· An Ecology Regional Office evaluator (from the same area as the applicant), and A "functional evaluator" with expertise in the specific water quality field of the proposal.
All evaluations were based on information provided in the proposal.
However, as one would expect, different evaluators offered unique perspectives.
Regional office evaluators may have some level of direct knowledge regarding the water quality problem(s) to be addressed and may be further aware of projects proposed in their region.
Functional evaluators often needed to rely solely on information provided in the proposal and their expertise in the subject area.
Functional Responsiveness Summary, Page 1
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List evaluators had a larger statewide view of project proposals.
Many scores were consistent, but these different perspectives were reflected in some scores.
Furthermore, information provided in proposals varied greatly, as did how applicants addressed "application tips."
Evaluators were often challenged by relatively "creative" answers.
Among the question areas where the difference in evaluator perspective was particularly apparent were II-D (Impaired aquatic species, particularly endangered or threatened), and II-I and II-J (Water Quality Standards violated and in jeopardy of being violated).
These questions were designed to allow the evaluators to use their professional judgement of the information provided in the proposal to assign priority points.
Likewise, throughout Question Area III (Solution and measures of success), point spreads of 20 between evaluators was not uncommon (and were acceptable) because of the aforementioned perspectives.
When independent evaluations resulted in scores that varied substantially, a third staff member conducted a re-evaluation, based on the information provided in the proposal, of only those question areas where there was a substantial spread of points.
In most cases, the third evaluator used point assignments from one of the evaluations.
Ecology staff treated all applicants equally and all applications were processed consistently.
Ecology staff explained the approach to the evaluation and prioritization process at the public meetings held during the public comment period on the Fiscal Year 2001 Draft Offer and Applicant List.
Rulemaking Ecology is now in the process of developing rules to help manage the Centennial and State Revolving Fund programs in future funding cycles, starting with Fiscal Year 2002.
For the most part, we are proposing to codify the existing guidelines in the amended rules, with a higher level of detail than the existing rules.
Further changes to local prioritization will also be included in the draft rule amendments now under development.
These changes will be based on the experience of the two-year pilot and the recommendations of the Financial Advisory Council (a group working on issues related to Water Quality loans and grants).
The more complete nature of the rules should provide a greater level of consistency for funding applicants.
Staff will hold hearings on the proposed rule.
The hearings will probably be held in two locations, one in the eastern part of the state and one in the western part, sometime in mid-October, 2000.
For more information on the rule development process, contact: Tim Hilliard Dept. of Ecology P.O. Box 47600 Olympia WA 98504-7600 (360) 407-6429 or thil461@ecy.wa.gov

Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List Responses to Comments Department of Ecology Initiated Comments: Ecology is aware of several changes which are needed to correct minor errors in the FY 2001 Draft Offer and Applicant List.
Specific changes are noted below.
Â· Ecology notes that adjustments in the loan amounts offered to two projects can be made due to funding declines and existing loan deobligations.
The total loan amount offered to the City of Centralia (FP01027) is $26,998,953, the total loan amount offered to the City of Bremerton (FP01153) is $959,573, and the total loan amount offered to the Rosa-Sunnyside Board of Joint Control is $10,000,000.
Due to a data error associated with the amount requested, the total grant amount offered to the Skamokawa Water and Sewer District (FP01069) will be $180,600.
Two minor scoring errors were noted for two projects, and there was no impact on rank or funding.
Changes have been made for the City of Spokane (FP01096) and the Columbia River Foundation (FP01135) projects.
An adjustment was made on the Adopt A Stream Foundation (FP01179) project.
The project was shown in the correct order on the FY 2001 Draft Offer and Applicant List, although an incorrect number of points for local prioritization was indicated.
A correction has been made.
Because of issues associated with project prerequisite approvals, three projects shown on the FY 2001 Draft Offer and Applicant List, Kitsap County (FP01142), Kitsap County (FP01145), and Thurston County (FP01185), are not eligible for funding consideration and are shown in the not-ranked portion of the list.
Ecology received 21 requests for evaluation comments during the public review and comment period.
The Thurston County (FP01185) Cooper Point Wastewater Facilities Construction Project was determined to be ineligible for funding due to compliance issues associated with the Growth Management Act.
The Western Washington Growth Management Hearings Board has ruled that this project does not comply with Thurston County's Comprehensive Plan.
Thurston County has indicated that it will appeal the Hearings Board decision and the project will remain ineligible for funding consideration until resolution of this issue occurs.
Eight projects received 10 additional local prioritization points due to the determination that a higher priority project in WRIA 13 was ineligible.
Local prioritization points were adjusted for Thurston Conservation District (FP01201), City of Tumwater (FP01203), and City of Lacey (FP01205; FP01206; FP01207; FP01208, FP01209; FP01210) projects.
Five projects received local prioritization points due to a reconsideration of local prioritization points for WRIA 6.
Local prioritization points were awarded for the Town of Coupeville (FP01028; FP01030), Clinton Water District (FP01094), Whidbey Island Conservation District (FP01149), and Island County Public Works (FP01197) projects.
Twelve projects not shown on the FY 2001 Draft Offer and Applicant List are offered grant funding on the Final Offer List.
Grant funds became available when a previously proposed project was determined to be ineligible for funding.
The twelve projects are FP01013 (Snohomish County Citizen-Based Public Involvement Campaign), FP01073 (Snohomish Conservation Dist. Fish Friendly Farm BMP Implementation, FP01076 (Upper Grant Responsiveness Summary, Page 3

Riley Slough), FP01127 (Cle Elum Interim Wastewater Treatment Facilities), FP01146 (Skamania County Stabler Water Quality/Quantity Study), FP01170 (Whatcom Conservation Dist. Recover Bertrand Creek), FP01179 (Adopt-A-Stream Foundation North Creek Streamkeepers), FP01199 (Pacific Energy Institute Leland Watershed Water Quality Monitoring), FP01028 (Coupeville Wastewater Treatment Plant Expansion), FP01030 (Coupeville Town of 1999 Comprehensive Sewer Plan, Refinancing), and FP01094 (Clinton Water Dist. Comprehensive Sewer Plan).
Comments From External Parties Bremerton, City of, Lynn Horton, Mayor, project numbers FP01150, FP01151, FP01153, and FP01154, comment: The City wrote two letters to Ecology.
One of the letters acknowledged acceptance of the proposed loan funding for the Anderson Cove CSO Reduction Facilities Project.
However, the loan amount was less than the full request and the City is hopeful that the full amount can be provided.
Concern was also raised regarding the City's ability to comply with the combined sewer overflow reduction schedule identified in a current Ecology consent decree considering a reduced level of funding for the proposed project.
The second letter from the City asks that Ecology reconsider the assignment of priority points for the four submitted projects in light of what was believed to be an inappropriate point spread in several question areas.
Response: The City has expressed its willingness to accept a reduced level of funding for the Anderson Cove CSO Project (FP01153).
Staff are pleased to note that the applicant will be offered partial funding of $959,573 for the project.
Additional SRF funding may be available and may be offered to the applicant in the future based on is present rank among proposals statewide.
Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposals and point assignments.
Staff will be working to limit scoring variability, wherever possible, during subsequent funding cycles.
However, staff found that information provided by the applicant for the two projects where detailed comments were provided, that scores were within the range of acceptable variation, given the different perspectives of evaluators (discussed in the Introduction); or information in the proposal supported the lower of the two evaluation scores.
Among the question areas where the difference in evaluator perspective was particularly apparent were II-D (Impaired aquatic species, principally endangered or threatened), and II-I and J (Water Quality Standards violated and in jeopardy of being violated).
These questions were designed to allow the evaluators to use their professional judgement of the information provided in the proposal to assign priority points.
Regarding Question area II-K the Mayor agreed with evaluator's comment that Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) actions are not identified yet.
Where such was the case, priority points should not have been assigned by either evaluator.
However, in fairness to all applicants, staff decided not to lower any applicant's score based on the reconsideration of scores requested.
Responsiveness Summary, Page 4
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List Regarding proposed special financial assistance consideration for enforcement related projects, throughout the life of these funding programs; staff have, and appropriately continue, to separate enforcement actions from the provision of financial assistance.
The priority system addresses this issue by assigning equal weight to remediation and prevention project proposals.
The applicant received full credit for addressing the Consent Decree in all four projects in question.
Although no specific information was provided regarding two of the proposals (FP01150 and FP001154), staff reviewed the respective scores and found the priority points assigned were very consistent.
No priority point adjustments were made for any of these four proposals reconsidered.
Chelan County Conservation District, Joel Teeley, Chair, project numbers FP01161 and FP01162, comment: The District wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the denial of local prioritization points for the projects submitted for funding in WRIA 45.
Response: Appendix Q of the FY 2001 Funding Program Guidelines references that any Statement of Agreed Priority must be received by Ecology no later than April 14, 2000.
The Statement of Agreed Priority for WRIA 45 was sent to Ecology on April 19, 2000, via facsimile transmission.
Since the Statement of Agreed Priority was submitted five days after the submittal deadline, local prioritization points will not be awarded to the projects in WRIA 45.
Clinton Water District, Mike Helland, Manager, project number FP01094, comment: The District wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the denial of local prioritization points for the projects submitted for funding in WRIA 6.
Response: For local prioritization points to be awarded in WRIA 6, seven signatures (Island County, City of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island Conservation District, Holmes Harbor Sewer District, Swinomish Tribe, Tulalip Tribe, and the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe) were required on a Statement of Agreed Priority.
Appendix Q of the FY 2001 Funding Program Guidelines references that if required signatures are missing, points will not be awarded, unless "written proof of reasonable and prudent efforts to notify that group" is provided to Ecology.
Signatures from the Swinomish Tribe and the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribes were not included in the Statement of Agreed Priority.
However, a signature from the Skagit System Cooperative was provided.
Upon further investigation, the Cooperative represents the Swinomish Tribe and the WRIA 6 prioritization committee understood the Cooperative represented the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, as well.
Upon learning that it did not, a signature was provided by the Point No Point Treaty Council, on behalf of the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, to support the priorities established for WRIA 6.
Ecology concurs with this explanation and local prioritization points will be awarded to the projects in WRIA 6.
Cooper Point Alliance, Jolene Unsoeld, project number FP01185, comment: The District wrote to ask Ecology not to fund the Cooper Point Wastewater Facilities Construction Project because of compliance issues with the Growth Management Act.
Responsiveness Summary, Page 5
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List
Response: Ecology has determined that Cooper Point Wastewater Facilities Construction Project is ineligible until issues associated with the Growth Management Act have been resolved and the project is ready to proceed.
Coupeville, City of, Larry Harmon, Public Works Director, project number FP01028, comment: The City wrote to Ecology to request a reconsideration the priority points in light of actions between the Town and Ecology staff, as it relates to the City's longer term financial assistance strategy.
The City is also requesting a reconsideration of the points awarded relative to the 1999 Comprehensive Plan, and question area II-C (Primary Contact Recreation), and Question area IV-B (Pollution Prevention), and the Local Priority-Setting Process.
Response: Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposals and point assignments.
Staff believe it is not surprising to see a comprehensive planning project proposal receive more points than one of the projects called for in the plan, as most comprehensive planning projects address numerous water quality problems and set the stage for several implementation projects to be developed.
As Question II-C parenthetically explains, primary contact recreation is limited to swimming and water skiing.
Regarding point assignments for pollution prevention, points were assigned the way other proposals were evaluated by both evaluators.
Local prioritization points for this project, along with others in WRIA 6, were re-evaluated (see response for Island County Public Works).
With the addition of local prioritization points for this project, Ecology staff are pleased to note that the applicant will be offered full funding.
Enumclaw, City of, Chris Searcy, Public Works Director, project number FP01102, comment: The City wrote to ask Ecology for prior authorization associated with the proposed funding for the Enumclaw WWTP Improvements Â­ Planning Project Response: Ecology is unwilling to approve the request for prior authorization in the absence of a final funding offer list.
Because funding amount adjustments become necessary, projects are not assured of funding until a final funding list is prepared.
Applicants proposed for SRF loans can proceed with incurring loan eligible costs for their projects as the SRF program does allow for refinancing of eligible project costs provided all federal requirements are met.
Granger, Town of, David Leach, Mayor, project number FP01026, comment: The City wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the awarding of priority points in light of what was believed to be an inappropriate point spread in several question areas.
The letter acknowledges that Question II-K (Implementation of a TMDL) was answered incorrectly, but requested that points be assigned for this question.
Response: Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposal and point assignments and agree that the answer to Question IV-D (financing project follow up needs) was adequate for the assignment of points.
An additional 20 points were assigned to the final score and the project was re-ranked accordingly.
Reconsideration of the other questions shows that point assignments
Responsiveness Summary, Page 6
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List were within the range of acceptable variation given the different perspectives of evaluators (discussed in the Introduction).
Before the start of the evaluation process, the evaluators reached a consensus that they would not add substantive information to that provided by applicants.
One of the evaluators initially did so on this project, but as the project was re-evaluated (because of the initial point spread), points were assigned by a third evaluator based on the information provided in the proposal.
Island County Public Works, Larry Kwarsick, Director, project number FP01028, FP01030, FP01094, FP01149, FP01197, and FP01198, comment: The County wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the denial of local prioritization points for the projects submitted for funding in WRIA 6.
Response: For local prioritization points to be awarded in WRIA 6, seven signatures (Island County, City of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island Conservation District, Holmes Harbor Sewer District, Swinomish Tribe, Tulalip Tribe, and the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe) were required on a Statement of Agreed Priority.
Appendix Q of the FY 2001 Funding Program Guidelines references that if required signatures are missing, points will not be awarded, unless "written proof of reasonable and prudent efforts to notify that group" is provided to Ecology.
Signatures from the Swinomish Tribe and the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribes were not included in the Statement of Agreed Priority.
However, a signature from the Skagit System Cooperative was provided.
Upon further investigation, the Cooperative represents the Swinomish Tribe and the WRIA 6 prioritization committee understood the Cooperative represented the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, as well.
Upon learning that it did not, a signature was provided by the Point No Point Treaty Council, on behalf of the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, to support the priorities established for WRIA 6.
Ecology concurs with this explanation and local prioritization points will be awarded to the projects in WRIA 6.
Issaquah, City of, Ava Frisinger, Mayor, project number FP01016, comment: The City wrote to thank Ecology for proposing to fund the Tibbetts Creek Restoration/Sediment Control Project.
Response: Ecology is pleased to hear that the City supports the draft list funding decisions.
King County, Wastewater Treatment Division, Don Theiler, Manager, project numbers FP01113, FP01155, and FP01157, comment: The County wrote Ecology to request a funding reconsideration for the Denny Way/Lake Union CSO Control; Denny Way/Lake Union CSO Control Â­ Design (Refinance); Denny Way/Lake Union CSO Control Â­ Construction projects.
Reconsideration was requested in light of what was believed to be an inappropriate point spread in several question areas, particularly Questions II-D and IV-A (Impaired Aquatic Species Habitat and Project Prerequisites, respectively) for all three project proposals.
The applicant also asked that general guidance be provided for establishing a local prioritization process.
Responsiveness Summary, Page 7
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List Response: Based on comments from the applicant and many others, staff will be providing in regulation (through the rulemaking process) and guidelines, general guidance for local prioritization processes.
Guidance will not be overly prescriptive, as it must be a local process.
Regarding what the applicant believes is an inappropriate disparity of scores, Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposals and point assignments.
Staff will be working to limit scoring variability, wherever possible, during subsequent funding cycles.
However, staff found that information provided by the applicant for these three projects, that scores were within the range of acceptable variation, given the different perspectives of evaluators (discussed in the Introduction); or information in the proposal supported considerably less than the requested maximum score available.
Among the question areas where the difference in evaluator perspective was particularly apparent was Question II.D (Impaired aquatic species, principally endangered or threatened).
Furthermore, all evaluators agreed to use general criteria, e.g. spawning and rearing habitat, area of impairment directly linked to the problem to be addressed, etc, in the assignment of these points, and applying these criteria to the information in your proposal, it appears that evaluators were relatively liberal in assigning points to your proposal.
However, in fairness to all applicants, staff decided not to lower any applicant's score based on the reconsideration of scores requested.
Regarding Question IV-A (Project Prerequisites), the applicant unnecessarily provided information in all boxes (see "Special Note" at the beginning of the question).
In so doing, we believe from the evaluation comments, that the applicant may have substantially confused evaluators, especially because the approval status of the various project contracts was very unclear from the information provided.
Any future submittals should clarify this information, and special care should be taken to use all instructions and application tips.
No priority point adjustments were made.
King County, Water and Land Resources Division, Deborah Lester, Biologist, project number FP01114, comment: The County wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the assignment of priority points in light of what was believed to be an inappropriate point spread in several question areas.
In one question area, Question II-K (Implementation of a TMDL), the County takes exception with both evaluation scores.
Response: Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposal and point assignments.
Staff found that information provided by the applicant in the question areas cited generally supported the lower of the two evaluation scores or that scores were within the range of acceptable variation given the different perspectives of evaluators (discussed in the Introduction).
However, in fairness to all applicants, staff decided not to lower any applicant's score based on the reconsideration of scores requested.
Staff agreed with both evaluators who did not believe the proposed project "implements actions of a TMDL that is still under development."(Question II-K) No priority point adjustments were made.
Responsiveness Summary, Page 8
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List Lind, Town of, Larry Koch, Mayor, project number FP01183, comment: The City wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider project eligibility issues for the Wastewater Disinfection and Collection Systems Improvements Project.
Response: Ecology reduced the amount requested on the funding application to be consistent with an 81 percent eligibility determination identified in the 1999 facilities plan approval letter.
The City asserts that this eligibility determination refers to a wider project, and the portion of the project addressed by this grant application was 100 percent eligible for funding.
Upon further review of the application, facilities plan document, and the latest approval letter signed on March 22, 2000, Ecology concurs with the City and the amount requested ($429,625) is provided on the final offer list.
Lummi Indian Business Council, Joseph Finkbonner, CEO, project number FP01133, comment: The Tribe wrote to Ecology to express its willingness to proceed with the North Fork Nooksack Sediment Reduction (Phase 2) Project based upon a reduced project scope of work commensurate with the reduced level of funding shown on the Draft Offer and Applicant List.
Response: Ecology is pleased to note that due to eligibility issues and declined funding related with other projects, it is able to offer the Tribe the full amount requested on the funding application.
No reductions in the project scope of work will be necessary and an amount of $250,000 is identified on the final offer list for this project.
Lynden, City of, Daryl Brennick, Mayor, project number FP01116, comment: The City wrote to Ecology to express its appreciation for proposed funding for the Wastewater Treatment Plant Upgrade/Expansion Project.
Response: Ecology is pleased to be able to provide funding for this project.
Marine Science Society of the Pacific Northwest, Kathleen Byrne-Barrantes, Board Director, project number FP01088, comment: The Society wrote to ask Ecology to transfer responsibility for the Nearshore Habitat Evaluation 
Response: Applicants requesting funding from the Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Fund can be local government entities or public not-for-profit groups.
Because funding has been identified for this project, Ecology is willing to negotiate an agreement with the Lemolo Citizens Club for this project provided that all understandings and conditions placed in the offer letter to the Marine Science Society of the Pacific Northwest are assumed by the Lemolo Citizens Club.
Mason Conservation District, Michael Madson, District Manager, project numbers FP01158, FP01159, FP01160, FP01190, FP01211, FP01212, and FP01213, comment: The District wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the denial of local prioritization points for the projects submitted for funding in WRIA 14.
Responsiveness Summary, Page 9
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List Response: For local prioritization points to be awarded in WRIA 14, five signatures (Mason County, City of Shelton, Mason Conservation District, Squaxin Tribe and Skokomish Tribe) were required on a Statement of Agreed Priority.
Appendix Q of the FY 2001 Funding Program Guidelines references that if required signatures are missing, points will not be awarded, unless "written proof of reasonable and prudent efforts to notify that group" is provided to Ecology.
Although copies of correspondence were provided reflecting efforts to include the Squaxin Tribe, no documentation on efforts to include the Skokomish Tribe was provided.
The District's request for reconsideration acknowledged the missing signature yet no provision was made for its absence.
Failure to include a required entity without explanation does not constitute reasonable or prudent efforts and therefore no local prioritization points will be awarded to the projects in WRIA 14.
Mason County Commissioners, project numbers FP01158, FP01159, FP01160, FP01190, FP01211, FP01212, FP01213, comment: The County Commissioners wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the denial of local prioritization points for the projects submitted for funding in WRIA 14.
Response: For local prioritization points to be awarded in WRIA 14, five signatures (Mason County, City of Shelton, Mason Conservation District, Squaxin Tribe and Skokomish Tribe) were required on a Statement of Agreed Priority.
Appendix Q of the FY 2001 Funding Program Guidelines references that if required signatures are missing, points will not be awarded, unless "written proof of reasonable and prudent efforts to notify that group" is provided to Ecology.
Although copies of correspondence were provided reflecting efforts to include the Squaxin Tribe, no documentation on efforts to include the Skokomish Tribe was provided.
The District's request for reconsideration acknowledged the missing signature yet no provision was made for its absence.
Failure to include a required entity without explanation does not constitute reasonable or prudent efforts and therefore no local prioritization points will be awarded to the projects in WRIA 14.
Pacific Conservation District, Nick Somero, Chairman, project number FP01089, comment: The District wrote Ecology to express concern about the perceived lack of funding for projects addressing Total Maximum Daily Load issues.
Response: Priority consideration of TMDL projects is already acknowledged through the evaluation questionnaire.
Question IIK (Does the project implement a portion of a TMDL?) of the application questionnaire provides up to 50 points for those projects directly addressing TMDL issues.
Water quality information collected as part of the TMDL process can be used throughout the application questionnaire to support answers.
While addressing TMDL issues is extremely important and environmentally necessary, the application questionnaire is designed to weight the relative merits of all types of water quality projects using an array of considerations.
Funding projects just because they are TMDL focused does not provide a fair and equitable system in light of other water quality needs.
Responsiveness Summary, Page 10
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List Parlette, Linda, Washington State Representative, 12th District, project numbers FP01029 and FP01194, comment: The Representative wrote to acknowledge Ecology funding of the Manson Area Stormwater Management Plan: Wastewater Treatment Plant (Pateros).
Response: Ecology is pleased that its funding decisions are recognized as helping to address water quality issues in the 12th Legislative District.
Pullman, City of, Mark Workman, Public Works Director, project number FP01012, comment: The City wrote to Ecology to decline the SRF loan amount proposed for the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan Project.
The City is unable to proceed with the project without grant assistance.
Response: Ecology accepts the City's decision and hopes that an application for this project will be re-submitted during the next funding cycle for this project.
Redmond, City of, Jon Spangler, Public Works Department, project number FP01169, comment: The City wrote Ecology to indicate its willingness to accept SRF loan funding for Idylwood Park Stream Restoration Project.
Response: Ecology is pleased that the City will be able to proceed with this project using SRF loan funding.
Rosa-Sunnyside Board of Joint Control, James Trull, Treasurer, project number FP01051, comment: The Board wrote to Ecology to express its willingness to proceed with the On-Farm Irrigation Conversions Project based upon a reduced level of funding as shown on the draft offer list.
Response: Ecology is pleased that this project will be completed with the SRF funding proposed.
Due to eligibility issues, declined funding related with other projects, and the inclusion of funds deobligated from previous funding cycle recipients, Ecology is able to offer the Board the full amount requested on the funding application.
An SRF loan in the amount of $10,000,000 is identified on the final offer list for this project.
Spokane County Conservation District, Rich Baden, District Administrator, project number FP01085, comment: The District wrote to Ecology indicating its willingness to accept SRF loan funding for the Hangman Creek Clean Water Program Project.
Response: Ecology is pleased that the City will be able to proceed with this project using SRF loan funding.
Squaxin Island Tribe, James Peters, Natural Resources Director, project number FP01190, comment: The Tribe wrote Ecology in support of the North Bay/Case Inlet Water Reclamation Facilities Project as the #1 priority for WRIA 14
Responsiveness Summary, Page 11
Fiscal Year 2001 Â­ Final Offer List Response: Ecology is pleased to hear from the Tribe regarding the importance and merits of this project.
Tribal support and project endorsement is highly desired and plays a major role in the local prioritization process.
It is unfortunate that the Squaxin Tribe did not sign the original Statement of Agreed Priority which was submitted for WRIA 14.
Signatures by both the Squaxin and Skokomish Tribes were needed to support the priorities established for all of the WRIA 14 projects to allow local prioritization points to be assigned.
No priority point adjustments were made for any of the project proposals in the WRIA.
Sultan, City of, Roy Bysegger, City Administrator, project number FP01196, comment: The City wrote to Ecology to express its willingness to accept SRF loan funding for the Surface Water Quality Management Plan Project.
Response: Ecology is pleased to be able to provide SRF funding for this project.
Thurston County Conservation District, Jaclyn Reid, Chair, project number FP01202, comment: The District wrote to Ecology to express a concern about the lack of funding for Total Maximum Daily Loading (TMDL) projects in the Chehalis Basin.
Response: Priority consideration of TMDL projects is already acknowledged through the evaluation questionnaire.
Question II-K (Does the Project Implement a Portion of a TMDL?) of the application questionnaire provides up to 50 points for those projects directly addressing TMDL issues.
Water quality information collected as part of the TMDL process can be used throughout the application questionnaire to support answers.
While addressing TMDL issues is extremely important and environmentally necessary, the application questionnaire is designed to weight the relative merits of all types of water quality projects using an array of considerations.
Funding projects just because they are TMDL focused does not provide a fair and equitable system in light of other water quality needs.
