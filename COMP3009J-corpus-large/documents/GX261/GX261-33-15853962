Disturb wintering wildlife as little as possible, particularly during critical feeding and resting periods.
They need all of their energy reserves to withstand the stresses of harsh weather and migration.
Do not litter Many birds die when they become entangled in fishing lines, 6-pack rings and other trash, or when they mistake garbage for food.
