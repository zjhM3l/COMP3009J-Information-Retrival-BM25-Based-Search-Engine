EXECUTIVE SUMMARY is term around by many each with his her own personal definition of what it EducationForasome,that is battedisisa seen as more ofpeople, is a videoatapeorand forprocessitthataincludesclassroomof means.
education brochure, for others it some is formal presentation.
To others, education a process than product; a a variety products in a variety of settings.
Education, as embodied in this plan, is a process--a three-step process.
Education begins with an understanding of the parts of the system under study--obtaining basic information and awareness of an issue.
This understanding is further refined through environmental inquiry--choosing an aspect to investigate, defining a problem and gathering information.
The education process achieves its objective when behavior change is adopted, and individuals take action based on their inquiry findings.
Systems understanding, environmental inquiry and taking action are the three steps that form the backbone of this education plan for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.
This plan begins with a brief look at the state of the fish and wildlife resource as it existed at the beginning of the development of this plan.
We will then look at current human population trends and needs in Chapter II, to help predict the future human landscape.
Chapter III departs from the traditional needs-assessment process by opening the discussion to the world through emerging electronic technology.
Here we will see what the general public thinks our educational needs are.
Chapter IV discusses current educational theories, examples of these theories in action, and how they may apply to WDFW educational strategies.
The foundation of the WDFW belief system (our core values) regarding the fish and wildlife resource is expressed in Chapter V through ethical codes of conduct.
The vision, goals, strategies and audiences for WDFW educational offerings are also described.
Chapter VI combines all of the above into three-step educational plans based on systems understanding, environmental inquiry and taking action.
Listed are strategies and tasks currently underway or needed.
No plan begins in a vacuum.
Similar planning and assessments have been conducted in the past, sometimes with a more limited focus.
All of the relevant preliminary work is condensed in the Appendices.
For the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, education is a key element in achieving its conservation and recreation objectives.
Effective education requires a planned effort based on thoughtful strategies that address pertinent issues.
The adoption of the three-step educational process of systems understanding, environmental inquiry and taking action is the foundation for the department's education successes.

INTRODUCTION the Washington Department of AsWildlife approacheslight21 new, Fishitand the century, must examine its operations in of more st
complicated challenges.
Human population will continue to grow, converting fish and wildlife habitat into urban, suburban and agricultural developments.
Many fish and wildlife populations are on a perilous decline, or soon will be.
An increasing human population demands increased recreational and commercial use of a decreasing fish and wildlife base, creating inherent conflicts.
The department enters this new century and its challenges with a checkered past.
Staffed with dedicated, caring individuals, it strains from a forced marriage.
Formed from two organizationally-unique predecessors with differing mandates, it struggles with its new, holistic charge.
Chronic under-funding, a declining license-buying base and increased demands for services and new programs to address emergent issues have created budget and operational problems of Titanic proportions.
One strategy to address these enormous challenges is a cohesive, systemic education plan.
Who needs to be educated, what do they need to be educated about, how will they be educated and who will do the educating are critical questions requiring a thoughtful response.
What is the current state of the resource? What are the current and projected trends and preferences in Washington? What are the best educational processes? What does the department hope to achieve from an education program? What are the most important issues the department wants to educate about? What do others say the department's educational activities should address? What will it take to be successful? What is the definition of success? How much will it cost? This education plan is intended to examine these and other questions in detail, providing sufficient background to build a plan to help the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife greet the challenges of the the 21st century.
Next: a Current View of Our Fish and Wildlife Resources.

CHAPTER I: STATE OF THE RESOURCE Anadromous Fish In 1993, the Departments of Fisheries and Wildlife and western Washington tribes completed an inventory of wild salmon and steelhead stocks.
Only 43% of the 435 stocks statewide were classified as healthy while the rest were either critical (3%), depressed (28%), or unknown (26%), with one extinct species.
Since 1993, many wild populations, especially chinook and coho, have continued to decline.
This circumstance is reflected by the actual and potential listings of many salmonid stocks as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act.
On February 26, 1998, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) proposed listing Puget Sound chinook and five other stocks of Washington salmon for protection as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
Lower Columbia steelhead were listed as threatened by the National Marine Fisheries Service on March 13, 1998, and Upper Columbia steelhead were listed as endangered on August 11, 1997.
The impact of the listing of these salmon stocks will affect land use and water-related activities in the entire Puget Sound region, including its urban areas.
Along with the existing and other potential listings of certain salmon, steelhead, and trout species on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, the impacts of the Endangered Species Act will be felt throughout the state of Washington.
SALMON RECOVERY PLAN The state, in cooperation with local governments, has developed a salmon recovery plan that addresses the basic threats to salmon survival -- habitat, harvest, hatcheries, and hydroelectricity.
Entitled Extinction is Not an Option - A Statewide Strategy to Recover Salmon, the draft plan was released in September 1998 by Governor Locke's Joint Natural Resources Sub Cabinet.
The stated goal of the recovery plan is to Restore salmon, steelhead and trout populations to healthy harvestable levels and improve those habitats on which the fish rely.
The recovery plan's objective is to: Develop and implement a coordinated statewide strategy that moves us aggressively toward the goal while maintaining a healthy economy.
The Statewide Salmon Recovery Strategy will take a balanced approach to addressing the factors of decline that are within human control, including harvest, hatchery, habitat modification and destruction, and hydropower.
Several recurring themes were identified in the plan.
Two have direct implications for education: Theme: We must make tough choices.
We are not going to save salmon by talking about it.
We must make changes in the way we conduct our lives in our communities and our watersheds.
These changes must result in improvement to salmon habitat, and include how we use our water, where we build our homes, how we harvest our timber and how we farm.
We are also going to have to change how we manage harvests of salmon.
Theme: We are all in this together.
Saving our salmon is not about blaming anyone.
We are all part of the problem and we must all be part of the solution.
Each of us must come to understand the impacts on our salmon and the opportunities we have to contribute to their protection and restoration.
The final guiding principle of the recovery plan states "Education of and outreach to policy makers, opinion leaders, state and local officials and all citizens of the state will be vital to the success of the strategy."
The Joint Cabinet recognizes that involving and educating the public in salmon restoration and natural resource issues is critical to successfully meeting its goal of recovering salmon.
Communities, neighborhoods and landowners have local knowledge of problems and ownership in the solutions.
Education is a fundamental part of community-based actions involving watershed councils, soil and water conservation districts, volunteer habitat restoration groups and other grassroots efforts.
People must understand the needs of steelhead/salmon in order to make informed decisions about changes necessary to restore and maintain healthy watersheds and healthy wild fish populations.
The overall mission is to inform, build support, involve and mobilize citizens to assist in restoration, conservation and enhancement of salmon habitat.
Effectiveness measurements will be developed and monitored based on the following outcomes:
8
An informed public that understands the condition of the wild steelhead and salmon and the consequences of having ESA listed salmon in their watersheds.
A mobilized public that works in support of salmon restoration, contributes resources toward salmon restoration and changes current practices and behaviors to support restoration
and preservation.
If the federal government is not satisfied with the state and local plans for conserving and restoring species, it could step in to regulate Washington land and water use.
If the federal government considers the plans to be adequate, the state and local governments will be able to maintain their control of resource management decisions.
Marine Fish Herring populations in Puget Sound have experienced a long-term decline in population size that is connected to a significant increase in natural mortality.
Since the late 1970's herring stocks have decreased by one-half.
Pacific herring are an important food source for many fish, birds and marine mammals.
There are 18 stocks of herring in Puget Sound; of those, 22 percent are classified as critical or depressed; and 39 percent are healthy to moderately healthy.
Sardines have re-surged in population size and now occur in substantial numbers off the coast.
Columbia River smelt have declined precipitously in recent years.
Surf smelts and sand lance populations have been stable.
Rockfish populations are in steady decline, and severe restrictions have been placed on sport and commercial fisheries in recent years.
Populations of 13 marine fish, including cod, ling cod, rockfish, hake and pollock have dropped dramatically in the last 20 years.
Additional harvest restrictions are likely.
One strategy recently adopted is the creation of Marine Protected Areas, where no harvest is allowed.
Shellfish Washington's shellfish resources are generally healthy, with the exception of abalone which is currently regarded as a depressed stock.
Shrimp and crab stocks in the ocean and in Puget Sound have been providing substantial harvests to the various fisheries.
The commercial dive fisheries for sea urchins and sea cucumbers have experienced declines in available harvest.
Razor clams are healthy and are not experiencing the NIX-related mortalities of past years.
Severe harvest restrictions on razor clams, however, may be enacted because of the presence of domoic acid, a toxin which is harmful to humans but apparently not to the clams.
Washington's shellfish beds support more than 350 commercial shellfish operations, employing 4,300 people.
Recreational shellfish-gathering is allowed at 142 beaches, of which 41 are closed due to pollutants posing health and safety problems for consumers.
From 1981-1996, 46,000 acres of shellfish growing areas have been downgraded, while only 7,000 acres have been upgraded.
Freshwater Fish Washington has a vast amount of fresh water.
With 4,174 lakes totaling 466,296 acres and 73,886 miles of streams, there is a lot of potential for fresh water fisheries.
But there is also a tremendous demand on that water from industrial, agricultural and municipal users.
And the single largest source of pollution to our waters is the everyday activity of citizens, such as fertilizing lawns and driving cars.
Endangered species issues are also a problem in fresh water.
In addition to the steelhead runs being proposed for listing as threatened on the Columbia and Snake rivers, resident bull trout are also being considered.
Of the 80 stocks of bull trout/Dolly Varden: 13 are healthy, 2 are depressed, 5 are critical and 60 are unknown.
Bull trout were proposed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in Puget Sound, the Washington Coast, Lower, Middle and Upper Columbia, northeast Washington and the Snake River on June 12, 1998.
There are 11 stocks of burbot: 1 is healthy, 1 is
9
critical and 9 are unknown.
The principle species of warm water game fish in Washington are largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, black and white crappie, bluegill sunfish, yellow perch, channel catfish and tiger musky.
The status of these populations is stable in terms of numbers and distribution, but most populations exist
in unbalanced predator/prey communities that offer only a fraction of their potential recreational value.
Rainbow trout remain the most sought-after game fish.
However, very little natural production of rainbow trout occurs, and the fishery is dependent upon hatchery production.
Wildlife Washington supports more than 640 vertebrate species and thousands of invertebrates.
Fifty-five of these are hunted or trapped and 96 are vulnerable, declining, or critical Species of Concern.
We have 23 endangered, 9 threatened, and two sensitive species in Washington, and 62 that are candidates for possible listing.
Another 158 are species which are monitored for status and distribution to prevent them from becoming endangered, threatened or sensitive.
Most of the 32 listed species that have declined in our state have been as a result of habitat loss.
Washington's human population continues to increase at record rates.
As this growth expands onto the land, wildlife habitat becomes further restricted.
In 1990, Growth Management Act (GMA) was adopted by the state legislature requiring local governments to address land use concerns beyond the scope of the State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA).
This new act requires Washington counties and cities to take a comprehensive, coordinated, proactive approach to land use planning that will guide land development in their jurisdictions into the next century.
With this act, state wildlife biologists are responsible for assisting and advising local governments in adopting policies and regulations that will support the agency's mandate to protect fish and wildlife resources and preserve our state's rich wildlife heritage in this changing landscape.
It is critical that wildlife biologists help cities and counties with site planning of developments such as Planned Residential Developments ( PRDs) and industrial parks, and support local agencies with technical knowledge of species and species management recommendations so they may preserve habitat within developments, and provide technical assistance for mitigation plans.
For example, the upland sandpiper appears to have been extirpated from the Spokane Valley because of mass development.
WDFW needs to identify potential high risk urban species and act to preserve these species.
Other changes in wildlife management in the state have become obvious with the recent drop in sales of fishing and hunting licences.
Washington's population is becoming more urbanized and, as recent surveys have shown, the population of hunters and fishers is declining, but over 75% of the population participates in non-consumptive wildlife recreation.
In addition, over 85% of the public are interested in increased protection and enhanced viewing of non-game wildlife.
Species do not have to be formally listed as threatened or endangered to be in trouble.
Populations of scoters, the state's most numerous wintering duck, have plummeted by more than 50 percent since 1979.
Seabird populations have shown large decreases in the past 5 years.
Amphibian population declines as well as deformities are appearing in Washington.
Wildlife management faces many challenges in the next millennium.
With increased urban population comes increased deleterious exotic species and nuisance wildlife.
The public unwittingly introduces non-native wildlife (such as bullfrogs in backyard ponds) or encourages nuisance and/or deleterious wildlife (feeds Eastern gray squirrels and Canada goose, feeds or leaves garbage open for crows).
Education and research should be done to prevent this.
Habitat and Water Quality Loss Statistics cited in Our Changing Nature - Natural Resource Trends in Washington State clearly show that fish and wildlife habitats have severely declined during the past generation, and with rapidly increasing human populations, the trend is likely to accelerate.
Consider these facts:
10
In the last 50 years, Washington has lost twothirds of it's old-growth forests, with most of the remaining old-growth at high elevations in national forests and parks.
Nearly all non-publicly-owned old-growth forests are gone.
From 1970 - 1992, nearly ten percent of all forests were converted to other uses - roads, suburbs, cities and farms.
Sixteen of the 48 Oregon white oak, ponderosa pine and dry Douglas-fir or grand fir community types are considered endangered or threatened.
Thirteen of the 54 Douglas-fir, grand fir, western red cedar, western hemlock, and western white pine associations are endangered or threatened.
Over 70 percent of native grasslands have been converted to other uses, and most of the remaining 30 percent are along steep canyon walls.
The Palouse Prairie is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States, with only one percent of the entire original habitat remaining.
Over one-half of the shrub-steppe habitat in Eastern Washington has been converted to irrigated crops; the remainder is heavily grazed by cattle.
Washington is considered among the poorest of
our nation's states in key water quality indicators, including having the third highest number of water systems violating the Safe Drinking Water Act.
One half of the state now has insufficient water to support all the needs of people, plants and animals.
The water in 250 streams is already overallocated.
There are 1,022 dams obstructing Washington's waterways, blocking thousands of miles of spawning habitat for imperiled salmon, with the destruction of critical riparian areas.
Statewide, over 31 percent of wetlands have been lost; in urban areas the amount is greater than 90 percent.
Between 90 and 98 percent of urban coastal wetlands have been lost.
Puget Sound has lost 70 percent of its tidally-influenced wetlands.
Forty-three percent of threatened and endangered species rely directly or indirectly on wetlands for their survival.
Twenty-five percent of Puget Sound's intertidal zone has been modified by human development.
Between 30,000 to 80,000 acres of wildlife habitat are lost each year to urban development, agricultural practices, timber harvesting, highway construction and other activities.
Population Increase Although Washington has the smallest land area of the eleven western states, it has the second highest human population density and continues to grow rapidly.
Each of the last four decades has brought a 20% increase in population.
The news for fish and wildlife is worse in our foreseeable future.
If growth continues at current rates, by the year 2020, Washington's human population will grow by another 2.1 million people to 7.7 million.
By 2045, Washington's population will double from it's current level, to 11 million people.
As stated in the 1998 report Our Changing Nature, this is equivalent to adding 29 new cities the size of Tacoma or Spokane.
That's one new city this large every 1.6 years.
Consequences of this explosive human population growth are: More cars that will further degrade water and air quality.
More energy consumed.
Greater demand on rural and resource production land for development.
Increased demand for timber, mines, gravel and rock pits.
Increased need for treatment and disposal of solid waste, sewage and storm water.
Greater challenges in providing drinking water.
More crowded recreation areas, especially those near water.
More stress on native plants and animals and their habitats resulting from housing developments, shopping malls, industrial parks, direct disturbance and increased recreational demands.
The early 1990s brought a surge in rural population The report continues: in Washington, mainly due to a large influx of semiWith twice as many people, another challenge retired Californians seeking affordable housing in will be how to minimize our damage to the environment and how to protect the remaining rural areas.
This trend has reversed in recent years, forests, fish, wildlife and grasslands.
Now and in the with urban Western future, at least three factors significantly threaten our natural resources: (1) the Washington now increasing 1.8 number and location of percent annually while rural people living in our state, (2) Next: a Look at Washington's Eastern Washington is the amount of resources we consume, and (3) the waste increasing at 1.2 percent Human Population and Desires. annually.
we produce.

CHAPTER II: CURRENT TRENDS AND PREFERENCES Ethnicity While the population of Caucasians is increasing in Washington, populations of other races are increasing at a much faster rate.
From 1990 to 1996, the Caucasian population increased 13% while the population of all other ethnic groups increased 45%.
Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics are the population segments increasing at the fastest rates, with both groups increasing 57% between 1990 and 1996.
(Figure 1.)
This dramatic increase in minority populations in Washington represents an opportunity for WDFW to target a growing group that currently is much less active in fish and wildlife related activities than Whites.
While figures from Washington are not available, on a national level minority populations participate far less in hunting, fishing, and watchable wildlife activities.

1997 Population Trends.
License and Recreation Trends A U.S. Fish and Wildlife survey completed in 1996 shows that between 1991 and 1996, numbers of hunters and fishers remained nearly the same while the U.S. population increased substantially.
(Figure 3.)
That is, while the number of hunters and fishers is remaining constant, the percentage of Americans who hunt and fish is declining.

The Washington Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation conducted a study in 1987 showing that over 50% of Washington households engaged in fishing, water activities, nature study, hiking, camping, snow activities, sightseeing and sports, with fewer engaged in hunting, shooting and motorized ORV riding .
(Figure 5.)

Percentages refer to percent of Washington households that engaged in the activity in 1987.
(Source: Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation.
Washington Outdoors: Assessment and Policy Plan 1990-1995.)
In Washington, the trend is similar.
While the population of Washington is steadily increasing, hunting and fishing license sales have declined since 1995.
(Figure 4.)
While this 1987 Washington study showed a high interest in boating and fishing, trends since then have been negative.
To determine why participation in these activities is declining, the Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council conducted a national needs assessment in 1998.
The findings of this study are in Appendix IV.
1996 WDFW Human Dimensions Research Survey In 1996, a telephone survey of 801 Washington residents was conducted.
Sixty-six percent (66%) of the respondents are frequently involved in wildlife-related activities, with 85% saying that wildlife-related activities are an important part of their lives.
Approximately 1/4th of the respondents participated frequently in traditional wildlife activities: twenty percent (20%) fished frequently, 11% hunted frequently and 25% fish and/or hunt frequently.
Fifty-eight percent (58%) were frequent wildlife observers.
Sixteen percent (16%) photographed or painted nature/wildlife frequently.
Seventy-five percent (75%) said that observing and learning about fish and wildlife that are not game species, such as songbirds, insects, marine mammals, reptiles, starfish and so forth, is an important part of their life, compared to 48% who said that fishing and/or hunting is an important part of their life.
Respondents expressed strong concern over the health of Washington's game and non-game fish and wildlife, with 57% rating the health of fish and wildlife populations as poor or fair.
Fifty percent (50%) rated the decline over the last 20 years as severe or extreme.
Respondents were asked to indicate to which programs WDFW should give more priority.
Two of the top six responses concerned education: -Programs using citizen volunteers for conservation projects, such as habitat restoration and protection.
-Providing information to the general public about how to help in the protection and restoration of wildlife and wildlife habitat in Washington.
Sixty-six percent (66%) of the respondents listed opportunities to view and understand wildlife as their first or second priority for department programs.
13
Recreational Volunteerism The researchers who analyzed the data from this survey were surprised with the very high interest in volunteerism, with approximately 1/4 of the respondents strongly interested in volunteering to help fish and wildlife.
"The interest in volunteering in conservation projects is too common to be considered `volunteerism' in the traditional sense.
The high level of interest expressed in volunteering for conservation projects would make it comparable in frequency to hunting and fishing activities, so perhaps it should be called recreational volunteerism and thought of as a product offering comparable to hunting and fishing
opportunities.
"As an activity, volunteerism needs to be developed as a `product' in the same way that hunting and fishing opportunities are viewed as products.
That is, a `recreational volunteerism' product should provide the level of satisfaction for its participants as hunting and fishing does for its own participants.
This would require that the volunteer opportunities be developed from the participant's point of view rather than from the Department's point of view.
The department has traditionally relied on volunteers for its Hunter and Angling Education programs, and for many on-the-ground restoration programs.
This survey identifies the opportunity to expand in these areas, particularly as they relate to the "taking action" step in the three-step educational process.
1996 National Survey, Washington Data The 1996 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation showed that Washington enjoys higher participation rates in fishing, hunting, and wildlife watching than the national average, and higher fishing and wildlife viewing than the neighboring Pacific States.
(Figure 6.)
Figure 6: Participation in Fishing, Hunting, and Watchable Wildlife.
Pacific Region includes Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii.

Washington itself is the destination for wildlife watching for both Washington residents and visitors from other states.
Washington residents spent 75 percent of their wildlife-watching (some 6.5 million days) within their own state in 1996.
Visitors to Washington spent close to 6 million days wildlife watching in our state.
Overall, participants in wildlife watching activities spent some 1.7 billion dollars in Washington on wildlife watching activities in 1996.
Money was spent for food, lodging, transportation, land-use fees, equipment rental, equipment purchase, and other related expenses.
Washington's wildlife resources contribute to social, economic, and cultural qualities of the state and its communities.
Recent survey data indicate that wildlife watching activities supported more than 21,000 jobs, yielded $426.9 million in job income; made $136.3 million in retail sales from bird watching and feeding; and generated $56.9 million in state and $67.4 million in federal tax revenues in Washington state.

Aging Population.
Twenty years ago, and 20 years younger, baby boomers activities.
In 1980, the age of the population peak was 20 to 24; in 1997, the to 49.
As baby boomers reach middle age, their recreational preferences change, in softer outdoor activities such as wildlife viewing, interpretive walks and nature
Since the mid 1980s, the population of children ages 5-17 has increased significantly in Washington state.
This trend is expected to continue until 2005.
While the population of young people has increased, populations of working-age adults (ages 18-64) and the elderly (age 65 and older) are increasing as well.
The huge population of baby boomers is reaching
middle age, with a significant change in recreation preferences.
(Figure 7.)
The Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council reports that only 9% of seniors currently participate in Fishing/Boating activities.
But they love wildlife watching and bird feeding.
Next: What Does the Public Feel Are the Vital Issues That the WDFW Needs to Educate About? 15
CHAPTER III: EDUCATIONAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT
In January following
1999, an educational needs assessment was conducted via an electronic e-mail questionnaire.
The feedback from internal and external audiences gives a view of the current issues; preferred educational outcomes and the behaviors that need to change.
Issues have been grouped by audience and existing WDFW educational programs.
This is raw, unedited input (except for spelling, grammar and elimination of duplicate entries and personal agendas.)
Some duplication in the listings is purposeful, as some issues are addressed by more than one educational program.
The questionnaire asked : "The WDFW needs to educate (audience) about (issue) because (outcome) so that (behavior change)."
Respondents were asked to fill in the blanks for audience, issue, outcome and behavior change.
Most respondents clearly defined the issue of concern, but the desired outcome of the educational activities and the hoped-for behavior change in the audience were a more difficult challenge.
All are presented below, with the issue identification being the most significant and helpful in program planning.
Over 160 responses were received, from a wide range of external and internal audiences.
The use of the e-mail process did not seem to limit any particular group from contributing.
The survey was highlighted on the WDFW Web page, and publicity concerning it was sent through traditional new releases, as well as through a variety of word-of-mouth, e-mail and list-server notifications.
In the few instances where individuals could not access the survey via e-mail, paper copies were provided.
Previous needs assessments are detailed in Appendix II.
From the needs assessment, it is clear that the systems that need to be understood include: Watersheds Riparian areas Estuaries and marine habitats Wildlife and habitats Fish and habitats Amphibians and reptiles Birds Endangered species Role of wildlife management in maintaining or sustaining species Biodiversity Wise use of resources and recreation Consequences of personal actions
Issues for All Education Programs Issue Adults - informed Inadequate funding of WDFW, and natural resource agencies in general.
Adults - novice Communication and education techniques.
They can be helpful to homeowners and persons with questions about wildlife in their neighborhoods in an approachable, non-intimidating, educational, non-technical and helpful manner.
To restore our wildlife and fisheries so that generations to come will be able to enjoy the wildlife and fisheries of today.
They will develop changes in their daily behaviors that positively affect fish and wildlife habitat and sustainable ecosystems.
They understand basic issues.
Better choices to protect and restore habitat and modify life When the general public currently call the department they do not feel like their questions and concerns have been heard, understood or responded to and they go away feeling like they have not been helped which results in little to no support for the ...
Wildlife habitat loss, fisheries habitat quality.
Needs of fish and wildlife will be adequately addressed, and local quality of life maintained.
Historic programs are either suffering, or being dropped, to the detriment of wildlife, hunting/fishing, and quality of life.
Outcome Behavior Change

The environment will be sustainable into the future.
All information from all managers is available for public Fish and wildlife information can be communicated to interested publics.
Habitat for all native wildlife will be preserved and created.
Habitat is being destroyed.
We only get one chance, once a species or ecosystem is lost is can NEVER be restored.
Over development and LACK of understanding how people not nature destroy There is a general lack of awareness of how directly actions such as SOV commuting and using lawn pesticides/fertilizers impact environmental health.
Clear cutting, stream polluting, suburban development, parking lots and roads covering the countryside.
The general population does not realize the importance of these areas.
Our disregard for our world is destructive.
It might eliminate a few lawns in favor of native plantings, etc..

Ecosystems, populations and the effects of habitat
Currently people do not appreciate native vegetation and do not understand its importance to wildlife.
Rampant habitat destruction.
People depend on an intact ecosystem, too, and this knowledge and appreciation will hopefully lead to desire to implement behaviors to sustain it.
We cant wait for others to fix the problems.
Toxic household and yard chemicals have far-reaching effects on humans as well as fish and wildlife especially when they enter the aquatic environment.
Many students are disconnected from the natural world.
Youth need to learn the skills of identifying and creating habitat.
We don't live in discrete boxes isolated from one another.

They become an informed citizenry, make quality decisions and take appropriate actions throughout their lives.
Families realize our reliance and our impact on local, state, national, and global ecosystems due to actions and inaction.
We must all learn to protect and value the ecosystems/habitats within which we live.
People take action and make decisions which result in negative impacts to our ecosystem without being aware of these impacts or alternatives that could have been less detrimental, or even beneficial.
The ecosystem that sustains fish 
It may draw more students to continue into college to study fish and wildlife and they can become more responsible stewards of our natural resources.
Students need a broader approach to complex environmental issues.
Currently there is a tendency to focus on one aspect of an issue.
Environmental issues.
Fish and wildlife issues.
Fish and wildlife habitat is restored or protected, and pollution or degradation is prevented.
Students can learn from experts in the field, rather than books and to get involved in data collection, monitoring and restoration projects.
Teachers can address them and develop skills on how to tackle the complexity of them in the democratic system.
Students leave the K-12 education system informed about the complexity of and need to be involved in

There is less negative impact on the wild native fish.
They will know how and want to make these improvements in their habits.
The public can be further education about natural resource issues.
They become aware of their threat to sensitive populations.
Honest mistakes and breaking the rules because of ignorance for instance a few does are shot because you obviously want to save the females )in this case save the wild Many anglers don't realize the alternative forms of fishing available, for species that are not in trouble, and in most cases are not Loss of angling opportunity not only exacerbates the agencies funding crisis, it snowballs the deterioration of loss in living quality and recreational opportunity in this Many stocks of wild native salmonids suffer from fishing pressure; many other species are available that aren't fished for as much.
These are the folks who are already on your side and the decisions they make influence the community now.
(That's what the young students will inherit, and unless we leave them with something to work with, it's a moot The department doesn't have adequate staff to do as much as needs to be done.

People use pesticides, degrade habitat, damage their private properties with salmon streams, etc. .
Currently marked and unmarked salmon can be retained in Puget Sound during salmon openings.
The public needs to be educated about upcoming selective fisheries, how to spot a marked fish and how to properly release an unmarked fish, if selective fish.
Current practices are endangering salmon and other native wildlife such as songbirds and encouraging problems such as Canada geese and allowing herbicides and pesticides to run off into the water affecting water People don't understand that the salmon are a direct result of their individual behavior patterns of consumerism.

Leaving trash behind.
Tossing beverage containers everywhere.
Blame is irrelevant, problems exist and need to get fixed, even at the expense of those who have no blame.
Fast fishing for that quick limit is unrealistic in the 1990s, if not impossible to provide due to budget cutbacks, and wild trout populations generally cannot provide that type of fishing.
Angler expectations must be in tune with reality, and taught.
Aquatic Education Issues Issue Adults - informed The importance of involving tribes in all restoration efforts, because they are Tribal and non-tribal groups develop partnerships that result in cooperative, more effective restoration.

WDFW needs to educate about management of TES species.
WDFW needs to educate community leaders and agency staff about value of working together on behalf of common values surrounding sense of place, wildlands and wild living things that stir the human spirit and make the planet a home.
WDFW needs to educate public about watchable wildlife sites and activities.
The people understand the magnitude of decline and the biological value the salmon have.
Further degradation of habitat is stopped.

The idea that development is beneficial progress.
Flood control prevents connectivity of the river to its flood plain.
Everyone who has a stake in fish is pointing the finger at someone else when it does not matter if the innocent get hurt if that is what it takes to solve the problems.
Many species require inter continental resources to survive.
Focus is still primarily on Washington's west side.
Reptiles and amphibians are part of our invisible state fauna, rarely seen and little known about them at technical and lay person levels.
Washington has large amounts of key lands ( low- mid elevation forests, shrub-steppe etc., in private ownership.
More expensive, poor use of limited resources, futility of long list of species.
It will be a very lonely place without some biological diversity.
Public can engage in pursuit of and recreation aimed at enjoying fish and wildlife in other ways besides angling and hunting.
WDFW needs to educate/engage in dialogue with range of ethnic groups of fish, wildlife and habitat concerns and values.
What specifically harms streams and wetlands.
Why they should, and how they can, protect natural resources.
Wildlife ecology and habitat preservation or restoration.
Adults - novice Landscaping and other land management activities that affect wildlife.

The harmful effects of human impacts can be lessened.
Wildlife and people may live together in a sustainable environment.
Professionals that provide advice and design help can be informed.
American public is changing, hunters are aging, seasons are more limited, perhaps even shorter, urban component of population is growing, gender ratio is 50:50 with watchable wildlife, wildlife watching is big business, good for local economies.
Studies from other states indicate for example that few Hispanics in Texas have visited a National park or wildlife refuge within their life.
Why should they vote to support fish and wildlife conservation and management.
Landowners often harm the environment unknowingly.
Too many people have a me-first-now attitude and don't see the need/payoff to spending their time, energy, or money in an effort to protect natural resources.
Growth development rarely consider wildlife requirements.
Students are graduating after two, four, and six years of college without a general understanding of how to incorporate ecological principles in their design and consultation work.
Our quality of life is linked to our Many people don't care, and others are against hunting.
Young people who have not been out in the woods, fields, and by the water themselves and experienced the damage to natural resources do not know (or care) what common, everyday activities do to our environment and ecological balance!.
Habitat is key and common ground among/between fish and wildlife users and that needs to be a shared vision regardless of other areas of difference.
We tend to value what we understand.
Development and pollution threaten these ecosystems.
WDFW employees are reticent to work with the public even with presentation tools available.
Students need to know what lives around the, and learn to collect data and monitor on a regular basis, using WDFW species presence information when relevant.
Kids are being taught in school how terrible hunting and firearms are.
They need to educate about game, hunting and firearm safety.

Co-management, a critical element of salmon recovery, etc., is off track and has been for several years.
Diking drastically alters the alluvial processes and vegetation that create some of the most critical habitat for fish and wildlife.
In the long run diking can create more problems than it solves, particularly when dikes inevitably fail during a flood.
Pesticides and fertilizers as well as used motor oil and pet waste are being dumped into our local waters.
Citizens need to stop viewing salmon as simply something to consume.

CHAPTER IV: THE EDUCATION PROCESS
In developing an education plan, it review recent research and trends
is important to in educational programming.
What works? What is no longer effective? What never worked to begin with? How should the agency's educational programs be shaped? Generally, environmental education asks four questions:
-What knowledge do you need? -How can we build your appreciation? -What can we do to help you make a better decision? -What can we do to help you participate? The following discussions reflect current, researchand experience-backed insights, nationally and locally.
How People Adopt an Issue and Change Behavior A National, Research-Based Example The following discussion is based on work by Hungerford and Volk, 1990, as discussed in Hooked on Fishing -Not on drugs as a Stewardship Education Program - A literature-based Program Review with Recommendations for Comprehensive Evaluation, Siemer, Knuth and Matthews 1998.
This discussion is not about the Hooked on Fishing, Not on Drugs Program, but about the education method it was evaluated against.
environmental action strategies; and an in-depth knowledge about issues.
Potential strategies for Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife education programs (adapted from Knapp et al. 1997) Entry-level Â·Deliver to citizens sufficient information to become knowledgeable about fish and wildlife.
Â·Deliver to citizens experiences that promote an understanding or comprehension of information about fish and wildlife.
Â·Deliver to citizens sufficient knowledge to become aware of the resource management policies and goals for fish and wildlife.
Â·Deliver to citizens experiences that promote an empathetic perspective toward fish and wildlife.
Ownership Â·Develop in citizens a cognitive awareness of how their collective actions may influence the quality of fish and wildlife and the environment in general.
Â·Deliver to citizens the knowledge necessary to investigate and evaluate fish and wildlife issues.
Â·Deliver to citizens sufficient knowledge to become aware of the resource management policies and goals for fish and wildlife.
Empowerment Â·Develop skill necessary for citizens to take responsible actions in regard to fish and wildlife issues.
Changing people's behaviors and ethics requires more than a mere dissemination of information.
Three variables, entry-level, ownership and empowerment,;have been identified to operate in a linear, progressive, way.
A progression exists from entry-level through empowerment, and responsible behavior will be more likely if all three levels of variables are included in an education program.
This process takes place over time, and may require sequential, complementary efforts in a combination of formal and informal settings.
Entry-level variables include environmental sensitivity, knowledge of fish and wildlife, and a basic understanding of ecological principles.
Ownership variables personalize environmental issues, creating individual ownership of the problem or issue.
They are critical to responsible environmental behavior.
These include an in-depth knowledge of issues on fish and wildlife; a personal investment in fish and wildlife issues; knowledge of the positive and negative consequences of behavior; and a personal commitment to resolving a problem.
Empowerment variables give people a sense that they can make changes and help resolve important environmental issues.
Major empowerment variables include knowledge of and skill in using
31
How to Create Change in Communities A Local, Experienced-Based Example A project team at the Local Hazardous Waste Management Program in King County, Washington, spent several months in 1995 reading behavior change literature from energy conservation, recycling, health education and other fields, looking for insights.
They distilled many of the principles found in the literature into workshops for staff, hoping to make their efforts to change business' and the public's hazardous waste behavior more effective.
Spending time up front clarifying and narrowing the objective is not always easy, but it should pay off later in more effective outreach strategies.
Next, brainstorm who--what audience or group--is important to achieving the desired result.
Then get to know that audience: What do they need and want? What do they know? Who do they respect and interact with? What change is needed from the audience to achieve the desired result? Most important, what are their barriers to making the change? Use what you've learned to refine your original objective.
It is only at this point, when you've identified key barriers to change and refined your objective, that you should develop strategies to reach the audience.
The key principles of using commitment, role models, change agents, credibility, and presenting information effectively can be used in developing strategies.
Last but not least, develop a method to find out how the strategy worked.
The following Checklist of Action Steps for Behavior Change and Key Insights chart a clear course for education planning.
A key insight from the project is that information alone is not enough to change behavior.
As government workers, we often try to solve a problem by creating a brochure, believing that if we build a brochure, they will come.
However, starting with a brochure starts at the wrong end of the process.
If information alone changed behavior, there would be no more smokers, all kids would wear bike helmets, and all businesses would follow the regulations.
In reality, there are many barriers besides information to achieving a result.
Good project planning identifies and tackles these barriers.
It's important to start any project by clearly defining the final objective, the desired end result.
Key findings
Checklist of Action Steps for Behavior change This is a circular process.
Working through steps 2, 3 and 4 may lead to redefining the objective in step 1
1.
Define your objective.
What is your desired end result? You may begin by thinking broadly, but narrow your objective so it's achievable and, if possible, measurable.
How will you know when you've achieved your desired result? 2.
Select your audience.
Brainstorm the possible audiences you could work with and choose one.
Pick the one most likely to get your desired result.
3.
Learn about your audience.
What do they need? What do they want? What do they know? What are their perceptions? Who do they respect? Who do they interact with (business and social networks)? Define the specific change you want the audience to make to achieve your overall result.
4.
Find out about your audience's barriers to making the change.
Go ask your audience.
Possible barriers include: External: it costs too much, technology isn't available, laws are conflicting, etc.
Personal: they don't recognize the problem, don't know what to do, don't consider it a priority, etc.
5.
Develop strategies to reach your audience, using the behavior change principles (e.g., commitment, feedback, credibility, role models).
Are there community or political leaders, associations, retailers, innovators, or other specific target groups that could help you reach your desired end result? 6.
Develop a method to measure the effectiveness of your strategies.
Refer back to your objective in step 1.
Summary: Key Behavior Change Principles The Bottom Line: Just providing information has a limited effect on behavior.
There is no clear causal relationship between providing information and changing behavior.
Learn about your customer or audience.
What do they know? Care about? Think about? Who influences them? Address the barriers to changing behavior.
Barriers may be external (it costs too much, technology isn't available, laws are conflicting) or personal (the person doesn't recognize the problem, doesn't know what to do, doesn't consider it a priority, thinks it's too hard, has no relative bearing in their life).
32
Key
Insights 6.
Incentives may help change short-term, but probably not long-term, behavior.
People may respond to incentives by changing their behavior, but when the reward is removed, they generally revert to their original behavior.
7.
If you need to provide information, present it effectively.
People are more likely to pay attention to information that is: -Vivid: Use language that conjures up a vivid and memorable image, or provide a demonstration that will stick in someone's mind.
-Personal: Make statistical data personally relevant.
Talk about personal consequences or refer to a group with which the person identifies.
-Specific and concrete: Tell them how to do the behavior you want them to do.
-Stated in terms of loss rather than gain: Focus on showing people or businesses how much they are losing every month or year by not doing a specific behavior.
-Told as a story: Use success stories as a motivating example.
-Emotional: People tend to be persuaded more by emotional messages than logical ones.
-Accurate.
1.
Getting involved is the first step to making a commitment, and making a commitment makes people more likely to act.
Small commitments lead to big ones.
Start by getting the shop owner involved in a visit.
Then ask them to sign a form stating changes they will make.
2.
Feedback and follow-up are important.
Feedback gives people cues about the impacts of their behavior changes.
Additional contact is also very important in motivating people to stick with a task.
3.
People will listen first to their friends or relatives, or others they see as credible.
What they hear at a dinner party will have more weight than a comprehensive data summary.
4.
Change agents and role models are important.
A few people in a group will typically adopt innovative ideas and behavior first, and spread them through the group.
Find these people and help them successfully adopt a new behavior.
5.
Changing attitudes may not change behavior.
There is no strong, direct or consistent relationship between attitudes and subsequent action.
Example - Getting Involved: Students as Scientists Another very effective educational approach is to involve the intended audience in helping to gather data that is valuable to the agency.
Using students as the target audience, the Washington Governor's Council on Environmental Education strongly advocates that natural resource agencies work with teachers and students to conduct relevant field work and gather data.
Students can provide scientific data about fish and wildlife, water, recreation, environmental health, insects, trees and plants, site restoration and other scientific questions.
Using students to conduct actual scientific work will strengthen collaborations among schools, communities and natural resource agencies, as well as providing valuable information to those agencies.
The benefits of school-agency partnerships are: Students will -Understand and use scientific concepts and principles.
-Increase critical thinking.
-Conduct scientific investigations to expand understanding of the natural world.
-Apply science knowledge and skills to solve problems or meet challenges.
-Use effective communication skills and tools to build and demonstrate understanding of science.
-See how science knowledge and skills are connected to other subject areas and real-life situations.
-Work with scientists in real-life situations.
-Foster an interest in the natural resource issues and problems they will face as adults.
-Learn about career opportunities.
Agencies will -Bring their knowledge and challenges of scientific policy-driven work directly to young citizens.
-Gain useful field data, not possible with current budgets.
Teachers will -Interact with scientists to improve classroom teaching.
-Teach in the context of actual communities and situations.
Schools will -Have access to resources such as scientific equipment not available through school budgets.
-Have access to other resources, including grants to support field and classroom work.
Next: Using Core Values and Codes of Ethics in Educational Planning.
33
CHAPTER V: GOALS FOR WDFW EDUCATION PROGRAMS
To begin the development of an the Washington Department of
education plan for Fish and Wildlife, an internal committee was created.
Member of this educational planning committee (identified near the
title page) shared a deep commitment to education, and represented all agency programs and geographic regions.
The following Core Values,Vision and Goals were drafted by this group.
What are our Core Values? Since so many of the behaviors people exhibit are based on their personal ethics, changing behavior and ethics go hand in hand.
Brainstorming sessions conducted by Rushworth M. Kidder of the Institute for Global Ethics identified a set of core ethical values that people share:, responsibility, fairness, honesty, respect, tolerance and caring.
A seventh value, freedom, is also important outside the United States.
Here, we take freedom for granted.
An education program should incorporate these core values, and should identify what is ethically sound for the people the program is trying to educate.
The following are examples of ethical codes for the public to adopt in day-to-day living; and for the Department of Fish and Wildlife in education program development.
An Individual's Code of Ethics for Protecting Washington's Fish and Wildlife Responsibility I want to be a responsible steward of fish and wildlife.
I will learn what needs to be done to help preserve our resources.
I will identify what changes I need to make in my personal actions to lighten my impact on the land and I will make those necessary life-style changes.
I will donate a portion of my time and other resources to help improve fish and wildlife habitat.
Fairness If I impact the habitat as a recreationist, commercial harvester or developer, I will choose the least-damaging option for fish and wildlife.
I will consider the effects of my actions on fish and wildlife when I use the land.
I recognize that I am a steward of the resources of the state, which belong to all people of the state and to future generations.
I recognize that I have an obligation to other users and future generations who are not here to represent themselves.
Honesty I am honest with myself regarding my environmental actions and inactions.
Respect I believe that all native fish, wildlife and plant populations have an intrinsic value in our landscape.
Tolerance I recognize that each issue has differing points of view.
While I may not agree with someone, I will allow them their right to express their side.
Caring Fish and wildlife are critical to my way of life.
I take the time to observe fish and wildlife and reflect on their condition.
34
WDFW's Code of Ethics in Education Program Development In addition to helping to foster a code of ethics among Washington's citizens, department employees should adopt and use the following ethic in developing educational programs.
Responsibility WDFW will identify the needs of fish and wildlife and make that information available to the public.
WDFW will identify issues and actions that impact fish and wildlife.
WDFW will recruit, train and direct volunteers to improve fish and wildlife habitats and populations and provide opportunities for people to help as individuals.
WDFW will advocate for the needs of fish and wildlife biodiversity and conservation.
WDFW will develop volunteer opportunities from the participant's point of view as well as from the department's point of view, to provide meaningful and enjoyable projects.
Fairness Programs will be accessible to all.
Education efforts will include diverse audiences who currently impact wildlife or who may be encouraged to appreciate wildlife.
Honesty Program materials will incorporate sound science; be accurate, timely and unbiased.
WDFW recognizes the limits of its ability to affect change.
Respect Similar educational efforts by other agencies and organizations are appreciated and recognized.
WDFW will collaborate and cooperate with others.
Tolerance Other points of view are respected.
Caring The individuals who are helping to make a difference are appreciated, recognized and thanked.
We work as colleagues in a positive, encouraging atmosphere.
Our work together creates a common sense of community where we work with each others' strengths and help with weaknesses.
Program Components Vision
Washington citizens will be informed about our complex fish and wildlife problems, will support the departments efforts to carry out its mission and will make the necessary changes in their behaviors to accommodate the needs of wildlife.
- Instill in the public the respect and commitment to protect the state's fish and wildlife resources through knowledge and personal responsibility.
- Provide the state's citizens with information and education services that will allow them to make decisions that will protect and benefit fish and wildlife and to behave responsibly in their activities.
Goal
Guiding Strategies -Effectively deliver to the public the framework, knowledge, content and process skills to intelligently engage in resource issues.
-Advocate for fish and wildlife.
-Incorporate all the educational steps-- entry-level, ownership 
-Learn about the attitudes and needs of all target audiences.
-Address all audiences.
-Make education every employee's responsibility; add to job performance evaluation.
-Provide experiential learning opportunities: Get them out.
-Adopt the concept of recreational volunteerism.
-Develop yearly themes to educate about and tools to assist and cross-train employees.
-Be innovative and open to new ideas.
Audience When asked "Who is the intended audience for this proposed program?" the answer often is: The general public.
But the general public has many discrete components.
The term stakeholder is often used interchangeably with
35
audience.
For the purposes of this plan, audiences will be addressed as follows:
Elementary school students (kindergarten through eighth grade) Secondary school students (ninth through 12th grade) College Citizen Citizen -Novice Citizen - Informed: External Stakeholders -anglers and hunters -landowners and developers -wildlife and recreation organizations (conservation, hiking, mountain bike clubs, etc.) -commercial fishing interests -license dealers -wildlife-related businesses -educators/schools/students -federal agencies -federal legislators -city and county officials -tribal groups -animal welfare groups -animal rights groups -media (TV, radio, newspaper) -other state agencies (forestry, agriculture,
tourism) -state legislators -state legislative staffs -governor's office -other industries (agriculture, biomedical, electric utilities, etc.) -business community -youth groups (scouts, 4H) -other civic groups (garden clubs, Rotary, League of Women Voters, Jaycees, religious groups) -churches Citizen - New, Emerging, Non-Traditional -Asian/Pacific Islanders -urban ethnic groups Internal Stakeholders -agency managers -commissioners -law enforcement -professional staff -office/clerical staff -retired employees -temporary/seasonal employees -public information and education staff -new hires
How Have We Addressed Audiences To Date? Educational offerings are provided by all department programs, to some degree or another.
A short description of each existing educational component (as of July 1, 1998) is presented in Appendix III.
The included table, based on the Knapp model, summarizes these components and identifies the level of behavior change and audience for which each is PRIMARILY intended.
It is understood that many educational components do cross behavior levels and reach multiple audiences.
(Please see Appendix III for a more complete description of the listed components.)
This analysis of current educational offerings reveals that most of the traditional education efforts of the Information and Education staff are intended for entry-level experiences, generally for large numbers of people.
A few are designed to progress to ownership and empowerment levels.
However, most of the ownership- and empowerment-level activities are conducted by staff from the resource (non-I
Next: Applying this to WDFW Educational Offerings.

CHAPTER VI: EDUCATION THREE-LEVEL PROCESS
This plan process
builds on the three-step education defined by Hungerford, V and Knapp, olk described in Chapter IV These researchers . described the education process as linear, beginning with entry level activities followed by ownership activities which lead to empowerment activities.
This education plan renames these steps to: understanding systems; environmental inquiry; and taking action.
The Education Planning Team felt that these more accurately describe the process for fish and wildlife education.
From the needs assessment in Chapter III, the systems that need to be understood include: S Watersheds S Riparian areas S Estuaries and marine habitats S Wildlife and habitats S Fish and habitats S Amphibians and reptiles S Birds S Endangered Species S Priority habitats and species S Role of wildlife management in maintaining or sustaining species.
S Biodiversity S Wise use of resources and recreation S Consequences of personal actions The following tables are the heart of the WDFW's ongoing and future education programs.
In the column "Underway" the codes reflect the current funding source: Aquatic Lands Enhancement Account (ALEA); Sport Fish Restoration (WB); Wildlife Fund - State (WLS); Personalized License Plates (PLP); General Fund - State (GF), Local, and Shewmaker Trust Fund (STF).
Tasks in the Needed column are potential tasks to be funded using the proposed Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999 grants.
Priorities will be determined for each fiscal year, depending upon available funding and current topical needs.
This full listing is to establish the overall framework for fish and wildlife education for the entire Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.
No activities are included for the Hunter Education Program, as it has its own six-year plan, valid through 2005.

As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, annual priorities will be developed, based on available funding.
Preceding the prioritization process, an annual evaluation of ongoing educational efforts will be evaluated for their effectiveness.
This three-step process is being included in ongoing planning activities in other programs, such as the Diversity Program's Strategic Plan, under development in June 1999.
If additional funding materializes, this structure provides a readymade template for investing future funds for effective educational programming.
At that time, additional meetings will be held with constituents to help determine priorities.

APPENDIX I: APPLICABLE RCWS Title 75 Department of Fisheries RCW 75.08.012 Mandate of the department.
The original mandate to the previous Department of Fisheries was to preserve, protect, perpetuate and manage the food fish and shellfish in state waters and offshore waters.
Additionally, the department was charged: shall promote orderly fisheries and shall enhance and improve recreational and commercial fishing in this state.
RCW 75.08.047 Fish hatcheries--Volunteer group projects.
In response to growing community interest in retaining and assisting local fish hatcheries, a specific law was adopted in 1995 to allow volunteer groups to undertake projects to raise donations, gifts, and grants that enhance support for the hatchery activities in the surrounding watershed that benefit the hatchery.
Activities may be conducted on department grounds, and the director shall encourage and facilitate arrangements between hatchery managers and volunteer groups.
RCW 75.50 Salmon Enhancement: Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups In response to a legislative finding in 1985 that many salmon stocks were critically reduced from their sustainable levels, immediate action was required to restore and enhance the fishery.
Among the many actions required by the Legislature was the establishment of 12 non-profit Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups (RFEGs) in 1991 representing all areas of the state with salmonids.
Citizen volunteers were appointed to the RFEGs to complete projects to enhance salmon.
A dedicated account was established from a surcharge on commercial and recreational fishing licenses and the sale of surplus salmon carcasses and eggs.
A citizen advisory board was created to oversee the projects, train volunteer groups and report to the Legislature if improvements are needed in the program.
RCW 75.52 Volunteer Fish and Wildlife Cooperative Projects In 1984, the Legislature found that fish and wildlife benefitted from contributions by volunteers from recreational and commercial fishing organizations, schools, and other volunteer groups.
The law provides for cooperative agreements between the Department and volunteers to increase the fish, shellfish and wildlife resources through habitat enhancement, rearing projects, research, interpretive and educational projects.
Funding is provided from the Aquatic Lands Enhancement Account.
RCW 75.54.005 Recreational Salmon and Marine Fish Enhancement Program.
In 1993, the legislature determined that recreational fishing opportunities for salmon and marine bottomfish have been dwindling, and that it is important to enhance the resource to assure sustained productivity.
Investments made in recreational fishing programs will repay the people of the state may times over in increased economic activity and in an improved quality of life.
RCW 75.54.080 Public awareness program.
The department's information and education section is charged to develop a public awareness program designed to educate the public on the elements of the recreational fishing program and to recruit volunteers to assist in recreational fishing projects.
Economic benefits of the program shall be emphasized.
Title 77 Department of Wildlife RCW 77.12.010 Policy of protection of wildlife.
The department shall preserve, protect and perpetuate wildlife.
Regulations shall be established that maximizes recreational opportunities without impairing the supply of wildlife.
The commission shall attempt to maximize the public recreational fishing opportunities of all citizens, particularly juvenile, handicapped and senior citizens.
RCW 77.32.155 Hunter Education Training Program Since 1957, Washington has had a hunter education program to instruct hunters in safe firearms handling, conservation, and sportsmanship.
Beginning in January 1995, all persons purchasing a hunting license for the first time, if born after 1972, have been required to complete at least 10 hours of hunter education.

Puget Sound Action Team From Puget Sound Water Quality Action Team 1997-1999 Work Plan -WDFW shall develop and implement a coordinated program of public education emphasizing the importance of wetlands and habitat to fish and wildlife.
The program will build on existing aquatic education programs and complement current salmon recovery and watershed initiatives.
Salmon Recovery Plan From Extinction is Not an Option - A Statewide Strategy to Recover Salmon. -The overall mission is to inform, build support, involve and mobilize citizens to assist in restoration, conservation and enhancement of salmon habitat.
This will be accomplished by working with tribal and local governments, local schools and colleges, associations, and other groups statewide as well as within regions and by sectors.
The education and outreach ideals outlined in the agriculture, habitat and enforcement/compliance sections of the Statewide Salmon Strategy will be integrated into this effort.
The major objective of this strategy has been to organize a statewide coalition of individuals, groups, associations and governments that will work together to educate the public about salmon recovery.
The three main goals are: -Inform the public about the condition of steelhead and salmon and how the public can be involved in their recovery.
-Inform the public about the impacts of the ESA listed salmon, steelhead and trout in their watersheds.
-Promote and enhance volunteer resources.

IAFWA Latino Outreach From Latino Outreach by the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies The rapid growth of the Latino population in Washington represents an opportunity for WDFW to reach this under-served group.
The International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (IAFWA) recommends the following strategies to recruit Latinos to sports fishing (Although IAFWA's focus is specifically geared to sports fishing, these strategies are applicable for targeting Latinos for other WDFW activities as well): -Make sure the Latino culture is addressed when developing outreach.
-Emphasize closeness of the family, and how the activity brings the family together.
-Continually search for ways to conduct on-going education within the fish and wildlife organization.
-Find ways for the organization to initiate contact.
-Become a part of the Latino cultural network.
-Determine whether translation of outreach material and/or program advertisements is necessary.
If so, make sure materials are well distributed and avoid translation pitfalls.
-Make community research the foundation of any outreach
52
program.
-Consider implementing urban fishing programs, which tend to be the best vehicle for reaching minority groups and increasing
participation.
-Maintain proper follow-up, the seal of success for any outreach program.
Puget Sound Action Team The following recommendations are from the Puget Sound Water Quality Management Plan -Watersheds and Fish Habitat: The Department of Fish and Wildlife shall convene a committee to develop a model watershed interpretive program at hatcheries that are easily accessible to visitors.
-Shellfish : WDFW shall convene a committee to develop an interpretive program at an appropriate location in Puget Sound.
-Wildlife Habitat Education: WDFW shall implement a program to introduce wildlife education at state parks and other recreational settings.
The program shall promote understanding of the habitats for marine, freshwater and upland wildlife by adapting hands-on activities from existing programs, many of them from K-12 curriculum such as Project WILD of WDFW, FOR-SEA of the Poulsbo Marine Science Center, and programs from the Office of Environmental Education.
WDFW shall work with Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission to provide training to park rangers.
WDFW and State Parks shall provide stipends for facilitators of the various programs, such as Project WILD, so that teachers may be trained to implement these programs on weekends and in the summer.

functions of Public Affairs for both the Department and the Fish and Wildlife Commission.
During the calendar year Public Affairs produces approximately 200 news releases, 12 newsletter columns for the director, several speeches, 25 fact sheets, weekly Governor's alerts, and 1,000 news clippings.
Editorial board meetings, news media interviews and media events in the field are coordinated.
Seventy-five radio stations use Department produced public service announcements.
These messages are carried on the state's radio stations 23,400 times annually.
In addition to other multi-media projects, Public Affairs provided 9 videos for education, training, and information.
Administrative Services Division Public Affairs Public Affairs provides advice to management and prepares public involvement and information strategies for major Department issues.
Media relations, public involvement, multi-media production, writing, and presentation development are the primary
Volunteer Co-op Projects
To achieve the twin goals of enhancing fish and wildlife and informing citizens of their natural resource heritage, the Department
54
issues annual grants.
Funds are administered to volunteers, schools, community groups and landowners.
Their projects enhance fish and wildlife habitat, create interpretive and educational displays, improve landowner relationships, and promote outdoor ethics and survival skills.
$429,550 of Aquatic Lands Enhancement Account (ALEA) funds have been committed to 39 projects representing an estimated 71,500 volunteer hours with an estimated value of $1,072,500.
An estimated $771,765 in other funds was provided by participating volunteers.
The average grant awarded was $11,000.
Master Watershed Stewards
This program is an interagency partnership, initiated by Project WILD, with Washington State University Cooperative Extension to train adult volunteers for up to 100 hours on skills to restore watersheds for clean water and habitat for humans, fish and wildlife.
Stewards volunteer back these hours on projects which have a positive impact on fish and wildlife.
Education Trunks Salmon and Wildlife Education Trunks that contain props, Project WILD education activities, slides and posters for presentations to youth and adults are prepared and available to employees.
Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups The program's goal is to restore and enhance salmon in Washington.
To accomplish this, the agency directly funds volunteer groups and provides technical assistance.
With these resources, volunteers can rehabilitate salmon streams, unblock or replace culverts that stop salmon passage, and school children and community groups can raise salmon and enhance their habitat.
Twelve volunteer groups work to revegetate streams, plant trees, clean up or replace culverts, provide passage to unused habitat, fence off livestock from streams or rivers, educate their communities about the need for clean water, raise and release fish, and research further methods to restore salmon to Washington.
In 1997, Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups contributed 30,000 hours of labor, at an estimated value of $375,000 to benefit salmon and salmon habitat.
Volunteers raised more than $3 million in contributions and donations to match (and exceed) the state's share of $458,000.
An estimated 16 miles of streams were restored, cleaned or opened up to salmon passage.
Volunteers completed 149 projects to enhance salmon.
Marine Fish and Shellfish Education The Marine Fish/Shellfish Education Program began as a razor clam license proviso for education on reducing wastage and over-limits on razor clams.
It now encompasses all marine fish and shellfish, including the entire watershed, estuaries and intertidal zones.
The program coordinator works with all marine interpretive centers and state parks, trains volunteers on tide walk issues, and conducts more than 150 classroom visits, ten civic group presentations and 20 summer low tide classes per year.
New initiatives include special outreach for Asian and Native American populations who utilize the marine and intertidal resources.
Hunter Education
Angler Education The angler training and recruitment program reached more than 6,320 students in 67 classes in 18 counties in 1997.
A total of 350 volunteer instructors donated 3,129 hours in classroom and fishing activities, mostly in the urban Puget Sound area.
This program trains the trainers to multiply its effectiveness.
Recent initiatives include teaming with Rotary Club International, Free Fishing Weekend Hot Spot Lakes, and Kids Fishing Clinics at boat and sports shows.
The goal of Hunter Education is to train potential and current hunters about safe and ethical hunting.
The strategy is to recruit and use skilled hunters as volunteer instructors to train new hunters.
The volunteer instructors offer training classes in all 39 Washington counties on proper hunting methods, firearm safety, hunting ethics, and state regulations governing hunting.
The Department staff recruit, inform, supply and evaluate the cadre of 700-plus volunteer instructors and inform the public of available courses.
In 1997, 23,934 instructor hours were donated to Hunter Education.
Washington Outdoor Women Washington is the last fish and wildlife agency in the country to form a partnership with women interested in the outdoors.
The specific strategy is to teach women a variety of outdoor skills, such as fishing, hunting, outdoor ethics, and survival, through weekend workshops.
By teaching in locations where participants immediately practice new skills, they gain quick confidence in experiencing and using the outdoors.
This strategy may assist them in introducing their children to outdoor activities and encourage more family experiences in the outdoors.
Twenty-five volunteers established their own non-profit organization to organize, staff and raise funds for two, two-day workshops for 1998.
Discontinued due to funding cuts in 1998.
Salmon in the Classroom This program provides 600 55-gallon aquariums strategically placed in school classrooms across the state.
Teachers and their students rear the salmon and trout eggs through fry, alevin and fingerling size, while conducting educational programs about salmon, fish, habitat, watersheds, and local stream protection.
Some school districts have adopted the program district-wide, making salmon a component of the science curriculum for 4th, 5th and 6th graders.
Most notable in the effort is the Renton School District, where every new elementary school is built with a flow-through aquarium installed.
Fairs and Exhibits The specific strategy is to increase Department presence at fairs and trade shows with easy-to-understand messages and practical applications to save wild salmon, preserve our hunting heritage, and take better care of Washington's natural resources.
Two primary themes have been developed for 23 fairs in 1998 with representation in each of the Department's geographic regions.
Project WILD Project WILD and Beyond trains teachers to lead educational activities at the watershed level, showing students how to maintain and restore streams and upland habitat while learning about fish and wildlife.
An interagency initiative with the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction and a Project WILD grant trained 870 teachers in 20 school districts on using fish and wildlife in education reform, bringing the total for the past five years to 3000 teachers and 50,000 students.
Internet The Department maintains a Website with new information added weekly.
The goal is to provide more interactive opportunities through our Website, especially for children.
Total average monthly visits to the Website is 12,098.
A user survey (November 1997) shows that the typical user visits the site frequently (58% weekly or daily); considers himself/herself a recreationist looking for information on rules, regulations and changes (57%) and indicated that the site provided them the information they were looking for (63%).
Comments regarding what they liked best about the site are: news releases, regulations and regulation changes, and all new and timely information.
Nature-Mapping To connect students and volunteers with their real-world resources through actual data gathering and monitoring, Nature-Mapping was jointly developed by the Department and the University of Washington's GAP Analysis Project.
Data collection forms and training in how and what kind of data to collect on terrestrial habitats and wildlife have been conducted.
A second protocol, Nature-Mapping for Fish and Streams to collect data on fish and habitat features of streams has been completed.
There are more than 500 teachers and 141 participants directing an estimated 30,000 students in Nature-Mapping activities.
More than 16,000 wildlife records were submitted in 1997, equating to at least 30,000 acres mapped for wildlife.
Nature in the City The specific strategy to bring nature into the city is to select five urban schools and offer a curriculum that combines natural history and environmental studies with basic learning requirements.
Students will have an opportunity to visit wildlife areas to understand how the areas are operated, to become aware of future
55
employment and recreation opportunities, and help restore a stream in their own community.
Public Disclosure The public disclosure officer coordinates with Department programs to provide public records in accordance with RCW 42.17.250.
Types of records requested include: landing records of commercial fishers (individual records, tribal and non-tribal fleet statistics), lists of names and addresses of license holders (commercial fishers, recreational fishers, hunters), salmon and steelhead escapement and release data for Washington streams, hydraulic permit approval files, Fish and Wildlife Commission documents, Department correspondence files, files for specific projects (duck stamp files, Mission Ridge files, problem wildlife files, etc.)
and abundance of urban wildlife; 3)Increase public knowledge and respect for ecological principles and the value of wildlife; 4)Increase wildlife recreational opportunities for the urban public.
The urban biologists actively educate the urban public, county and city planners and commissioners.
They serve as primary resource contacts and consultants for the Nature-Mapping program; attend fairs and workshops; lead environmental education workshops; and give presentations and lead interpretive field trips throughout the year.
In addition, this program frequently develops and distributes informative and educational wildlife related brochures.
Backyard Wildlife Sanctuary program Provides certification for people who promote good wildlife habitat on their property.
7,000 properties have been certified to date statewide.
Program is promoted at several events throughout the year across the state, with personal assistance from westside or eastside urban wildlife biologists.
As part of this program, the Crossing Paths newsletter is distributed to the 7000 participants twice yearly.
Publications Services Publication Services provides products to both internal and external customers, completing approximately 550 projects a year.
In coordination with all internal programs, this work unit designs and produces publications that are mandated by statute as well as slide presentations, maps, overheads, fact sheets, signs, kiosks, displays, technical reports, instructional materials, fliers, brochures, posters, and certificates for volunteers.
Habitat Demonstration Project
Fish Management / Hatcheries Division North of Falcon Process Five meetings February-April each year to develop a state and tribal fishing policy with major public input.
Up to 100 people representing various organizations (not including WDFW staff or tribal representatives) attend these meetings.
Nine sites statewide to demonstrate techniques for improving wildlife habitat.
Techniques such as the use of nest boxes and native plants are modeled.
General public and developers are encouraged to use these sites as models for their own property.
Wildlife Stewardship Program New program in which 25 landscape architects, nursery workers, and other experienced people go through a 10-week training to learn landscaping-for-wildlife techniques.
These 25 people will then return 50 hours of time teaching what they have learned to the general public by way of slide shows, consultations, etc. .
Volunteer Butterfly Surveys A two year old program that identifies butterfly species using certain Seattle parks and Spokane natural areas.
Fishing Regulations Pamphlet Various issues are communicated to the public through this publication.
There has been an effort to involve the public in the process of developing these regulations.
There is a How to get involved section on the inside cover and there are currently 1500 people on the mailing list largely due to this effort.
600,000-800,000 copies/year are printed.
Eagle Watch Program Program in which 15 eagles' nests in urban areas are monitored by volunteers for productivity.
.5 FTE, $30,000.
Backyard Bird Survey 500 volunteers to date are involved in conducting surveys of winter birds and band-tailed pigeons in their backyards.
Public Meetings/Hearings These meetings and hearings usually revolve around developing sports fishing regulation processes.
20-30 meetings/year. .
Neotropical Migrant Bird Banding, Raptor Surveys, Herp Surveys Volunteers are coordinated by eastside urban wildlife biologist each year to conduct these surveys.
Over 800 hours of volunteer hours are accumulated each summer.
Personal Contacts in the Field
Field staff sampling fish catches for data are asked questions about Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife that are not necessarily related to their particular task.
They are the front line in communicating with the public.
Urban Breeding Bird Surveys On the westside, every two years a survey of breeding birds in six locations is conducted utilizing 20 volunteers.
On the eastside, five areas in the Spokane area are surveyed each year by volunteers.
Hatchery Tours Tours given to organized community groups and walk-ins off the highway.
50 hatcheries x one 1-hour tour monthly = 600 hours.
Endangered Species Program Part of this program includes producing brochures for the public on what species are endangered in Washington and what WDFW is doing to help.
Telephone Calls for Information
In many communities in Washington, the telephone number for the local hatchery is the only number for WDFW in the telephone directory.
Hatchery staff thus field many telephone calls with requests for Departmental information not necessarily related to hatcheries.
Telephone Calls for Information Wildlife Management Division personnel respond to 400-500 requests per year for information.
Many of these callers are scientists looking for information to complete Environmental Impact Statements.
Wildlife Management Division Urban Wildlife Program This program employs three full time positions having these four goals: 1)Protect, preserve and perpetuate wildlife habitat, populations and diversity in urban areas; 2)Determine distribution
Watchable Wildlife Program This program develops opportunities for the public to view and appreciate native fish and wildlife in Washington.
As part of this effort, WDFW works with Falcon Press to publish the Washington Wildlife Viewing Guide and produces 4-8 wildlife interpretive projects per year.
Additionally, the program attends four major wildlife festivals per year.
Track-A-Caribou Program
56
New project in conjunction with Project WILD in which interdisciplinary Internet and classroom activities will allow middle school students to investigate caribou, caribou habitat and the complexities of wildlife management.
Presentations
Personnel in the Research Division make an average of 50 presentations annually to sports groups, scientific groups, environmental organizations and classrooms.
Lands and Habitat Division Interpretation The Lands Division administers 25 major wildlife areas in the state, almost all of which do some form of environmental interpretation.
These areas get 1.2 million visitor days/year for non-consumptive activities.
Mount St. Helens Wildlife Area gets 500,000 visitor days/year with interpretation done by Weyerhaeuser, Cowlitz County and the U.S. Forest Service.
Oak Creek Wildlife Area gets 300,000 visitors/year and Skagit Wildlife Area gets 150,000-200,000 visitors/year.
Public Hearings
The Wildlife Management Division holds 20-30 public hearings per year.
An average of 100-300 people attend each hearing.
Certification Class In order to hunt Brant, Snow Geese, or Canada Geese, hunters are required to participate in a certification class that teaches identification techniques.
300 people/year attend.
Hunting Regulations Pamphlet Brochures The division produces pamphlets to inform the public on various wildlife issues.
The most recent pamphlet dealt with dangerous wildlife issues.
Washington Conservation Corps The Lands Division administers the Washington Conservation Corps, a young adult employment and training program.
The program reaches 50 young adults ages 18-25 per year and focuses on accomplishing stewardship work projects on Department Wildlife and Access Areas.
In addition to on-the-job training, members receive a variety of classroom training to help them become more employable upon completion of the program.
Hunting Shows/Trade Fairs Several biologists across the state help staff agency booths at annual shows that feature hunting information, including the Inland Northwest Wildlife Council's Bighorn Outdoor Sports Show in Spokane, the Western Washington Sportsmen's Show in Puyallup, and shows in Yakima, Tri-Cities, and other places.
One-On-One Contacts with Public
There are 40-70 staff in the Salmonid Screening Habitat Enhancement and Restoration Division that constantly make contact with the public on the ground during construction project development to educate them about why fish passage, habitat restoration, and screening are necessary.
Enforcement Division The Department of Fish and Wildlife, Enforcement Program, currently employs 147 commissioned personnel who make over 300,000 public contacts annually.
Each Enforcement Officer devotes approximately 3% of his/her time performing outreach and education within their communities, making presentations to sports clubs, civic organizations, school groups, etc.
Fish and Wildlife Officers oftentimes find themselves in the role of educator.
They talk to members of the pubic about laws and regulations, hunting and fishing prospects, ethics, stewardship, habitat, and conservation.
In addition to their law enforcement duties, i.e., conducting investigations, compiling evidence, writing case reports, and testifying in court, they responded to over 3,000 human and wildlife conflicts in 1998.
As Washington's population continues to spread into outlying areas, officers will continue to focus on educating landowners, stakeholders, and residents about deer and elk damage, as well as encounters with dangerous wildlife.
Technical Assistance The Environmental Engineering Division provides technical assistance to the public on specific projects that deal with fish passage, streambank protection, flood hazard management, and habitat restoration.
These staff provide assistance for 250 projects/year.
Publications/Guidelines 200 copies/year of fishway passage design guidelines are distributed to county commissioners, other agencies, consultants, volunteer groups and individuals each year.
The division is currently in the development stage of streambank protection guidelines.
200 people have participated in workshops to develop these guidelines.
Workshops The Lands Division conducts the following workshops: -Culvert Fish Passage Design for county engineers, Department of Transportation, and Consultants.
4 workshops/year, 30 people/workshop -Screen Workshops - 2 workshops/year, 25 people/workshop Rootwad and Willow Seminars (streambank protection, flood hazard management, gravel removal, etc.) for biologists and volunteer groups.
300 people/year
Volunteer Enforcement Groups The Enforcement Program has approximately 25 volunteer Reserve Officers who assist fully commissioned Regional Officers in routine field operations.
Additionally, organizations such as the Washington State Archery Association, recently stepped forward and asked how they could become actively involved in assisting officers.
Under the guidance and direction of the Regional Captain, Eyes in the Woods is a volunteer group that is growing and reporting fish and wildlife violators.
Stream Watch and Unit Watch are still in the planning phase.
Videos The Salmonid Screening Habitat Enhancement and Restoration Division has made two videos on fish passage that are shown in various forums.
Outdoor Recreation Shows Prior to budget cuts experienced by the Program in 1998, Officers were able to devote more time toward staffing agency booths at a number of Fish and Wildlife trade shows across the state.
These included the Inland Northwest Wildlife Council's Bighorn Outdoor Sports Show in Spokane, the Western Washington Sportsmen's Show in Puyallup, the Puyallup Fair, and shows across the state.
Regrettably, the reduction in officers and a shift in priorities has reduced the Officer's ability to participate in these important activities.
Priority Habitats and Species This program serves to provide comprehensive information on important fish, wildlife and habitat resources in Washington to local governments, state and federal agencies, private landowners and consultants, and tribal biologists.
One important educational aspect of this program is data sharing of wildlife occurrence data with city and county planning departments for use in Growth Management Act planning and enforcement.
Puget Sound Technical Assistance Unit
57
This unit provides technical assistance to local jurisdictions to integrate agency concerns into planning, development, and other actions affecting fish and wildlife habitat in the Puget Sound Basin.
Biologists in the unit support implementation of the Puget Sound Water Quality Work Plan through participation on watershed planning committees, review and comment on Growth Management Act plans and revisions to Shoreline Master programs, and working with local planning staffs and conservation districts.
Biologists in the unit are also currently working on producing a slide show on river processes and a video on marine bulkheads.
consultation, and 2% on direct educational outreach (schools, sport clubs, etc.) using a variety of educational materials.
Gold and Fish Program The Habitat Division produces a booklet entitled Gold and Fish that serves to inform prospectors about fish-friendly prospecting techniques and serves as the Hydraulic Project Approval.
Posters, Pamphlets, etc.
Occasionally Priority Habitat and Species staff produce posters or pamphlets to inform the public about various issues.
Examples include a pamphlet about cats and wildlife and a poster about bats.
Area Habitat Biologists Area Habitat Biologists perform educational functions in one form or another nearly 100% of their time.
They spend about 60% of their time on Hydraulic Project Approval work, 10% on Forest Practices, 10% on State Environmental Policy Act reviews and comments, 10% on Growth Management Act Planning, 5% on a variety of watershed planning efforts, 3% on non-regulatory
Agricultural Exposition Several biologists from the eastern and Columbia Basin regions staff an agency booth at this annual show in Spokane totaling at least six days of time.

APPENDIX V: SFBPC SURVEY and Boating Partnership The Sport Fishingnational project to identifyCouncil undertook comprehensive solutions to a declining participation in recreational fishing and boating.
An executive summary from meetings held throughout the country in January and February, 1998, identified the following top 15 constraints to fishing and boating participation: 1.
Lack of time, competition for time, and complexity of schedules 2.
High cost of recreational boating.
3.
Negative images of resource and water quality (dangers of eating fish).
4.
Negative impact of animal rights information on fishing.
5.
Lack of identified messages that recognize market changes and work for each market segment.
6.
Insufficient process to educate current fishing and boating participants or to recruit new ones.
7.
High cost of angling participation -- licences/equipment/tax.
8.
Insufficiently educated stakeholders to address new recreational fishing and boating activities.
9.
Public perception that water safety problems are worse than they actually are.
10.
Quality and adequacy of facilities/access to support recreational fishing and boating activities.
11.
Perception of inadequate enforcement of existing recreational fishing and boating and environmental regulations.
12.
Lack of interjurisdictional cooperation and communication (specially noted by tribal representatives).
13.
Increased resource competition from alternative water users.
14.
Habitat degradation.
15.
Controversy over fish management philosophy and practices.
The Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council provided the following situation analysis in it's draft Strategic Plan for the National Outreach and Communication Program: 1.
Demographic changes are problematic for increased participation.
A. Minority populations, with low rates of participation, are growing three times faster than Anglo populations.
B.
Other populations with low participation rates are also among the fastest growing (e.g. older Americans and those who live in urban areas).
2.
Motivations between and among boaters and anglers are varied.
A. Anglers' motivations vary from catch-oriented to sociallyoriented.
B.
There is a misconception that there is a typical boater or angler.
This limits participation by non-typical segments.
3.
Boating and fishing are social behaviors.
A. Exposure early in life is important -- 95% of adult anglers fished as children.
B.
A social network is needed to recruit and retain adult boaters and anglers.
C. Education is needed to increase skill levels and enjoyment and to foster long-term participation.
4.
Among the most important constraints to boating and fishing are: -Perceived lack of time and/or money -Lack of access to (or knowledge of) facilities -Negative images of aquatic resources and water safety -Inconsistent delivery of satisfactory boating and fishing products, services and facilities.
-Lack of a consistent positive image of boating and angling.
