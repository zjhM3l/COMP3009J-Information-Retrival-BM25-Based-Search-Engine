HALE, State Chair Reform Party of California 662 Manzanita Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94086 888-82-REFORM E-mail: PaulHale1@earthlink.net Website: http://California.ReformParty.org Libertarian Party The Libertarian Party, founded in 1971, is one of the most successful third parties in U.S. history.
Dozens of Libertarians hold office across California, including Mendocino County District Attorney Norman L. Vroman, Calaveras County Supervisor Thomas Tryon, and Moreno Valley City Councilmember Bonnie Flickinger.
Libertarians are neither liberal nor conservative.
Libertarians believe that you have the right to decide for yourself what's best for you and your family, and to act on that belief, so long as you respect the right of other people to do the same and you deal with them peacefully and honestly.
The Libertarian Party of California is dedicated to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Improving education by empowering parents, not bureaucrats, to make the important decisions for their children Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increasing health care quality and access by removing government controls and instituting proven free market solutions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Safer neighborhoods by punishing violent criminals rather than wasting resources prosecuting victimless crimes Ã¯Â¿Â½ A cleaner environment through innovative property rights solutions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sharply reducing California's bloated $81 billion state government Increasingly, voters frustrated with the status quo are turning to the Libertarian Party.
We invite you to join us as we fight for everyone's liberty on every issue, all the time.

Please join us as we work together to build a brighter, more prosperous California.
