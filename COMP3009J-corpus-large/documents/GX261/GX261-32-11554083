Club Drugs: Herbal Ecstasy What is herbal ecstasy? How is it different from Ecstasy? Herbal ecstasy is a combination of herbs that are legal, cheap, and advertised as a "natural high."
Herbal ecstasy can be bought over the counter in drug stores, music stores, and shops around the country for approximately $3.00 per pill. http://www.lef.org/fda-museum/3suppress_truth_nutrients/let_092996.html
The active ingredients are caffeine and ephedra, also know as ma huang.
Ma huang is a drug that' been used in China for 2000 years to treat breathing problems.

Ecstasy, on the other hand is illegal and the active ingredient is MDMA (this stands for methlyenedioxymethamphetamine).
Both drugs are stimulants (uppers), though, and basically have the same effects on the body.

What are the effects of herbal ecstasy? Isn' it safer than the illegal t Ecstasy? NO! Ephedrine (the key ingredient in herbal ecstasy) speeds up your heart and central nervous system, just like Ecstasy, and can cause harmful reactions in people with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.
People who are sensitive to ephedrine can suffer from heart attacks, strokes, and seizures when taking the drug, also.
Ibid In fact, in 1996 the FDA reported 15 deaths and 395 illnesses related to use of herbal ecstasy.
On April 10, of that year, they issued a warning against "herbal ecstasy" use. http://ndsn.org/MAY96/HERBAL.html
In addition to heart attacks and seizures, Herbal Ecstasy can also cause psychosis (a lost sense of reality).
A Great Britain man suffered from a psychosis after long-term use of Herbal Ecstasy.
After being admitted to an emergency room for hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren' there), he hallucinated that someone was trying to t kill him, and jumped from an upstairs window trying to escape his imaginary attacker.
