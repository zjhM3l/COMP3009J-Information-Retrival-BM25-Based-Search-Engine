T HE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF INDIANA This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Geological Survey and the Indiana Geological Survey for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.
Indiana ranked 21st among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value1 in 1997, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Although dropping from a ranking of 20th in 1996, Indiana's 1997 estimated value of $639 million was up about 2% compared with that of 1996.
This followed a 6.6% increase from 1995 to 1996 (based on final 1996 data).
The State accounted for more than 1.5% of the U.S. total nonfuel mineral production value.
Indiana's increase in value in 1997 mostly resulted from an $18 million, or 7%, increase in the value of crushed stone and a $6 million, or 4%, increase in portland cement.
These increases more than compensated for a 14% decrease in construction sand and gravel value (table 1).
Compared with 1996, all other nonfuel mineral values increased except for those of common clays and peat, which decreased slightly.
Compared with USGS estimates of the quantities of minerals produced in the other 49 States during 1997, Indiana remained first in dimension stone, second in masonry cement, seventh in gypsum, and eighth in lime.
Indiana ranked 7th in ball clay production, dropped from 4th, to 6th, in peat and from 6th, to 10th in common clays.
Additionally, the State was a significant producer of crushed stone, portland cement, and construction sand and gravel, ranking 12th, 12th, and 14th, respectively.
The State's mines exclusively produce industrial minerals and coal; all raw steel and primary aluminum produced in the State are processed from materials received from other domestic and foreign sources.
Based on USGS estimates, the State remained third in the production of primary aluminum.
Indiana continued to lead the Nation in the production of raw steel with an estimated output of about 23 million metric tons (25 million short tons), according to the American Iron and Steel Institute preliminary estimates.
The following narrative information was provided by the Indiana Geological Survey2 (IGS).
In 1997, new sand and gravel pits were opened by Niblock Excavating, Inc. in Elkhart County; 1 The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 1997 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are estimates as of January 1998.
For some commodities (for example, construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement), estimates are updated periodically.
To obtain the most current information, please contact the appropriate USGS mineral commodity specialist.

Rieth-Rielly Construction Co., Inc. in St. Joseph County; Esters', Inc. in Shelby County; and Evansville Materials, Inc. in Vanderburgh County.
In addition, Kokomo Gravel, Inc., operated next to the abandoned Martin Marietta Aggregates gravel plant near Kokomo, Howard County.
Martin Marietta Aggregates will be opening a new sand plant in Howard County.
S
A new dimension limestone quarry, called Walton Quarries, Inc., opened in Lawrence County.
Among major closings, Martin Marietta Aggregates closed its Utica Sand and Gravel plant in Clark County and stopped producing sand at its 96th Street plant, Hamilton County.
Leary's Gravel Co., Inc., closed its sand and gravel operation in Hancock County and Old Prairie Products, Inc., closed its gravel plant at Liberty Center, Wells County.
Cowles Sand and Gravel, Inc., Fulton County, closed its Collins pit, moved across the road and opened the McKinney farm pit.
CBB, Inc., closed its aggregate pit in Lake County, but continues to haul for other companies.
Shelby Gravel, Inc., closed two sand and gravel operations in Shelby County and opened another in the same county.
Also, Fisher's Asphalt Sand and Gravel, Starke County, was sold and closed.
Several acquisitions occurred in the aggregates industry.
Martin Marietta Aggregates acquired the Indiana holdings of American Aggregates, with the exception of the Richmond plant in Wayne County, but sold the Harding Street crushed stone quarry in Marion County to Cornerstone/Benchmark Materials Midwest (the Kentucky Stone Co.) because of antitrust laws.
American Aggregates sold the Richmond plant to U.S. Aggregates.
Martin Marietta Aggregates also acquired the O.K. Sand and Gravel Co., Inc., in Marion County.

State legislators passed a new budget in May that provides approximately $687 million over 4 years for highway construction.
The State's general assembly set aside an additional $100 million from the State's $1.6 billion surplus over the next 2 years for State road repairs, with money apportioned to all towns and cities on the basis of size and population.
Legislators continued with efforts to obtain more Federal funds to support an extension of I-69 between Bloomington and Evansville, and other road construction projects.
The introduced State bills which became law were as follows: HB 1541 redefines the term "special waste" for certain environmental laws to exclude ceramic block materials, fire brick, fire clay, iron and steel slag, some refactory brick, and refractory earth, and makes unnecessary the acquisition of an environmental permit for certain uses of foundry sand; SB 169 allows the disposal of waste tires at mineral extraction sites if the disposer owns or leases the mineral site, if the waste tires were used on off-road construction or mining vehicles or other equipment, and if they are buried at least 25 feet underground; and HB 1992 deals with many environmental issues, and contains the provision that mineral owners or leaseholders will be notified of and allowed to respond to any water protection zones established around community water system wells.
The Indiana Department of Environmental Management will open a Southwest Regional Office in the Evansville area in late summer or early fall 1998.
Monroe County passed a new zoning ordinance allowing crushing of minerals in mineral extraction zones but also placed several restrictions on such operations.
