I.
Funds Available for Projects
This Final Intended Use Plan (IUP) describes how the state of Washington plans to use the moneys available to the Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund (SRF) during state fiscal year 2001 (FY 2001).
Total funds available for this year's IUP will be $68,245,512.
This total is based on receiving the federal fiscal year (FFY) 1999 and 2000 Title VI capitalization grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the required 20 percent state match to the federal grants from Washington State's 1999 - 2001 biennial appropriations, principal and interest repayments from previous funding cycle loan recipients, and deobligated funds from previous funding cycle loan recipients.
Four percent of the federal Title VI capitalization grants are designated for the Department of Ecology's (Ecology) eligible administration costs.
The remaining $66,375,156 will be available as loans for water pollution control projects.
The following table illustrates SRF funds available for FY 2001.
Federal Fiscal Year 1999 Title VI Grant State Match (20%) to Federal Fiscal Year 1999 Federal Title VI Grant Federal Fiscal Year 2000 Title VI Grant State Match (20%) to Federal Fiscal Year 2000 Federal Title VI Grant Principal and Interest Repayments from Previous Funding Cycle Recipients Deobligated Funds from Previous Funding Cycle Recipients Total SRF Funds Less (4%) of Federal Fiscal Year 1999 Title VI Grant for SRF Administration Less (4%) of Federal Fiscal Year 2000 Title VI Grant for SRF Administration Advertised SRF Funds Available for Projects $23,419,143 $4,683,829 $23,339,745 $4,667,949 $7,496,718 $4,638,128 $68,245,512 ($936,766) ($933,590) $66,375,156
Total demand for SRF funds this funding cycle exceeds the amount available.
The SRF program received 94 funding requests for over $228 million.
The state of Washington is proposing to offer approximately $66.3 million in low-interest loans to 29 local governments for 35 highpriority water quality projects.
II.
Goals
Ecology has both long-and short-term goals that guide the administration of the SRF program.
These goals are: A. Short-Term Goals 1.
Work with Ecology's Water Quality Financial Advisory Council to revise and update the SRF rule (Chapter 173-98 WAC "Uses and Limitations of the Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund") that includes but is not limited to: Page 1 of 17

5.
To protect public health and water quality, and to achieve overall improvement and protection of the environment.
To encourage local governments to develop and implement projects which will prevent water quality degradation, including wetland protection projects.
To assist communities with financial difficulties in meeting required public health and water quality standards while maintaining the health and perpetuity of the SRF according to federal law and guidance.
To provide the type and amount of financial assistance most advantageous to communities, consistent with the long-term health of the fund.
To administer the SRF program to ensure that the financial integrity, viability, and revolving nature are maintained.
To integrate local watershed planning legislation passed during the 1998 legislature in evaluating and prioritizing water quality project proposals.
The local watershed planning approach to water quality management involves: Â· Phase 1 - the establishment of a watershed planning unit that includes representatives of state, county, and tribal governments located in one or more of the 62 water resource inventory areas of Washington State.
Phase 2 Â­ development of watershed assessments that address, where applicable, water quantity, instream flows, and habitat.
Phase 3 Â­ development of a watershed plan based on recommendations of watershed assessment and begin to implement water quality protection and prevention projects.
III.
A. Uses Details of specific uses of SRF moneys are contained in the state regulation (Chapter 173-98 WAC "Uses and Limitations of the Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund"), program guidelines (revised December, 1999), and the Operating Agreement (dated September 11, 1989.)
In summary, SRF moneys can be used to support projects in three funding categories: water pollution control facilities category, nonpoint source pollution control category, and comprehensive estuary conservation and management category.
Uses and Terms of Financial Assistance

SRF moneys can be issued for the following purposes: 1.
To make loans, at or below market interest rates, to applicants in order to finance the planning, design, implementation, development and construction of facilities and activities.
To buy or refinance the debt obligations, for construction of water pollution control facilities, incurred after March 7, 1985.
To guarantee or purchase insurance for local obligations to improve credit rating.
To provide security or a source of revenue for State SRF issued bonds.
To finance reasonable costs incurred by Ecology in administering the SRF program.

B. Terms
The terms of SRF financial assistance are established and included in Chapter 6 of the program guidelines.
However, after the guidelines were published Ecology evaluated the current SRF loan portfolio to determine if loan interest rates and terms could be reduced from the current level and still maintain the fund in perpetuity in accordance with federal law.
The analysis showed that the fund was very robust and could remain so with much lower rates for FY 2001.
In addition, the lower rates will have a positive impact on the water quality of the state, the fiscal health of small towns struggling to fund projects, and lower interest rates helped market the program.
For example, during the SRF FY 2000 funding cycle approximately $25 million was requested for projects by local governments and this funding cycle over $228 million was requested.
For FY 2001, the following terms are offered to applicants: Repayment Period Up to five years: 15 to 20 years: Interest Rate 0.5 percent 1.5 Percent
In order to formally offer these lower interest rates, Ecology made minor changes to the rule governing the SRF program (Chapter 173-98 WAC).
These changes created a simplified schedule for determining each year's interest rates and also allow the agency to further lower those rates when analysis shows that lowering the rates will not adversely affect the health of the SRF loan portfolio.
Applicants may be considered for financial hardship terms if their proposed projects would cause user charges to exceed 1.5 percent of the median household income.
If Ecology determines that financial hardship exists, it may structure SRF agreements with terms to help keep user charges
Page 4 of 17
below the financial hardship level, if possible.
Hardship terms may include lengthening the repayment period to a maximum of 20 years and/or adjusting the interest rate to as low as 0 percent.
Ecology proposes to provide SRF financial hardship assistance to the following local governments: Application Number FP01069 FP01028 FP01030 FP01027 FP01057 FP01037 FP01081 FP01080 Applicant Name/Project Title Skamokawa Water

Assurances and Certifications
The necessary assurances and certifications required by Title VI of the Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987, and the EPA have been included in the Operating Agreement between the state of Washington and EPA.
Section IV.C of the Operating Agreement states "The Department of Ecology shall transfer into the SRF a state match consisting of either cash or a letter of credit, which equals 20 percent of each federal grant payment, on or before the date when the state of Washington receives the federal grant payment."
To further clarify this, Washington State will provide EPA with a "Letter of Commitment" which shows that the required state match has been committed.
Washington's matching share will be deposited into the SRF account when an actual draw is made for the federal share of SRF moneys.

Criteria and Method for Distribution of Funds
The following approach was used to develop the proposed distribution of $66,375,156 to local governments from the SRF: A. Applications for Funding Information about the SRF program, workshops and the application period for SRF assistance were distributed to local governments and interested persons statewide.
During January 2000 four public workshops were held statewide in Tacoma, Everett, Spokane, and Yakima.
At the workshops, information on the SRF program and the application process was presented.
Three additional workshops were held during February 2000, in Spokane, Bellevue, and Chelan to provide applicants technical assistance and to answer one-on-one, specific project and application questions.
Applications for funding were accepted during the application period, from January 3, 2000, through February 29, 2000 .
Based on information provided in the applications, projects were evaluated and prioritized.
A detailed description of the application and project evaluation process is found in Chapter 2 of the Water Quality Financial Assistance Programs Guidelines.
A summary of the process is described below.
Page 7 of 17
B. Project Evaluation Ecology used a new evaluation process during the FY 2000 funding cycle.
This process was refined for the SRF FY 2001 funding cycle.
The process incorporates changes from previous finding cycles, suggested by Ecology's external group the Water Quality Financial Advisory Council (Council).
The Council comprised of representatives from many stakeholder groups which includes loan and grant recipients.
The Council reviewed the previous evaluation and ranking process and identified areas where changes were needed.
Ecology used these recommendations to develop the evaluation system used for the FY 2001 funding cycle.
In their most important guidance, the Council recommended to continue using evaluation criteria with assigned point values.
Ecology had used points in the past but had not used them for several funding cycles.
In the revised system, evaluators assigned points for answers provided by applicants to questions in five categories.
An additional category at the beginning of the questionnaire requests the applicant discuss the overall water quality problem and how the problem will be solved or addressed by the project.
No points are assigned, but the answer serves as frame of reference for applicants and evaluators.
The categories are: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Overall water quality problem and how the problem will be solved or addressed by the project.
Specific public health and water quality impairments caused by the problem and pollution prevention aspects.
(Category total: 340 points) How the project addresses the water quality problem/ measures of success.
(Category total: 340 points) Local initiatives taken to make the proposed project a success.
(Category total: 120 points) State of Washington or Federal mandates that this proposed project addresses.
(Category total: 100 points) Local Priority-Setting Process.
(Category total: 100 points)
Ecology evaluated the proposals, assigned points, and used the points to develop a statewide priority list in numerical order.
At their discretion, other state agency staff involved in water pollution control and public health provided funding recommendations to Ecology evaluators.
VII.
Distribution of Funds
Chapter 173-98 WAC, Uses and Limitations of the Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund, updated in 1999, requires Ecology to distribute money according to the following category allocations: Eighty percent of the fund is to be used for water pollution control facilities, 10 percent of the fund is reserved for nonpoint source pollution control, and 10 percent is allocated
Page 8 of 17
for comprehensive estuary conservation and management.
Unless the demand for funds is limited, not more than 50 percent of each funding category allocation can be awarded to any one applicant.
In addition, if requests for SRF assistance in one category do not result in the offer of all available funds, any remaining funds are transferred to other categories.
Loans may be provided for up to 100 percent of the total eligible project cost.
Loan offers that will be identified on the Final IUP will be effective for up to one year from the date of the offer or until the issuance of the next year's Final IUP.
All SRF loan offers that do not result in a signed SRF loan agreement within the effective offer period are automatically terminated.
Funds reserved for SRF loan agreements that are not signed within the effective period maybe carried over and made available for the next year's funding cycle or offered to applicants who did not receive all funds requested or to other applicants on the Final IUP who did not receive funding offers.
VIII.
Allocation of Funds Among Projects This Final IUP contains a list of all local governments with projects considered for funding and those that are proposed to receive assistance during this funding cycle.
This list was established based on the total amount of funds available for each category and after the eligible applicants projects have been evaluated and prioritized.
The list of local governments considered for funding and those with projects offered funding is included as Attachment 1.
IX. Descriptions of Projects Proposed for Funding
All projects considered and offered funding are described in Attachment 2.
X. Proposed SRF Payment Schedule
The proposed schedule of payments from EPA to the state of Washington are shown on Attachment 3.
XI. A. Funding Cycle The SRF Draft IUP for FY 2001 was available for public review and comment from June 30, 2000, to August 2, 2000.
Ecology requested comments on both the contents of the Draft IUP and the list of projects proposed for funding.
Comments received during the public review and comment period were carefully assessed.
Modifications were made to the list of projects proposed for funding as a result of comments received on the Draft IUP, applicants declining proposed loan offers, and the addition of $4,638,128 deobligated from previous funding cycle recipients.
Two public meetings were held statewide to discuss the preparation of the Draft IUP.
The public meeting were held in Tacoma and Spokane.
Ecology staff discussed the Draft IUP along with the process used to prepare it.
The Centennial, SRF, and Section 319 Draft Offer and Applicant List for FY 2001 were also discussed at the public meetings.
Page 9 of 17 Public Review and Comment
B. Local Prioritization Process The local prioritization process used during the FY 2001 application cycle was the second year of a pilot process.
It was similar to the first year, with certain changes and simplifications.
One major change was to use only Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIAs) as local prioritization areas, eliminating the confusing choice of WRIAs or counties.
Another major change was to allow local watershed planning groups organized under the Watershed Planning Act to act as the local prioritization group.
The third major change was a simpler and shorter list of required signatures.
More detailed information about the local prioritization process may be found in the Water Quality Program Financial Assistance for Fiscal Year 2001: Guidelines (Volumes One and two), available on request from Ecology.
C. Evaluation Process The FY 2001 Project Priority System and Evaluation Process was developed to provide a tool to rank all projects submitted on a statewide basis.
This ranking included both point source and nonpoint source facilities and activities project proposals (both remediation and prevention based proposals).
The system placed all project proposals on an initially equal footing based on water quality and public health criteria.
At least two Ecology staff with water quality proficiency conducted a complete review of each application: Â· Â· An Ecology Regional Office evaluator (from the same geographic area as the applicant), and A "functional evaluator" with expertise in the specific water quality field of the proposal.
All evaluations were based on information provided in the proposal.
However, as one would expect, different evaluators offered unique perspectives.
Regional office evaluators may have some level of direct knowledge regarding the water quality problem(s) to be addressed and may be further aware of projects proposed in their region.
Functional evaluators often needed to rely solely on information provided in the proposal and their expertise in the subject area.
Functional evaluators had a larger statewide view of project proposals.
Many scores were consistent, but these different perspectives were reflected in some scores.
Furthermore, information provided in proposals varied greatly, as did how applicants addressed "application tips."
Evaluators were often challenged by relatively "creative" answers.
Among the question areas where the difference in evaluator perspective was particularly apparent were II-D (Impaired aquatic species, particularly endangered or threatened), and II-I and II-J (Water Quality Standards violated and in jeopardy of being violated).
These questions were designed to allow the evaluators to use their professional judgement of the information provided in the proposal to assign priority points.
Likewise, throughout Question Area III (Solution and measures of success), point spreads of 20 between evaluators was not uncommon (and were acceptable) because of the aforementioned perspectives.
Page 10 of 17
When independent evaluations resulted in scores that varied substantially, a third staff member conducted a re-evaluation, based on the information provided in the proposal, of only those question areas where there was a substantial spread of points.
In most cases, the third evaluator used point assignments from one of the evaluations.
Ecology staff treated all applicants equally and all applications were processed consistently.
Ecology staff explained the approach to the evaluation and prioritization process at the public meetings held during the public comment period on the Final IUP. Ecology would like to thank all of the applicants that participated in the SRF's twelfth funding cycle.
Because the SRF is a revolving loan program, it will provide a long-term source for financing publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities, nonpoint source pollution control projects and comprehensive estuary conservation and management programs.
We look forward to working with those local governments identified in the fundable portion of the Final IUP and with others in future funding cycles.
D. Responses to Comments Department of Ecology Initiated Comments: Ecology is aware of several changes which are needed to correct minor errors in the Draft IUP.
Specific changes are noted below.
Â· Ecology notes that adjustments in the loan amounts offered to three projects can be made due to proposed funding offer declines and existing loan deobligations and one ineligible project that was proposed for funding on the Draft IUP.
The total loan amount offered to the City of Centralia (FP01027) is $26,998,953, the total loan amount offered to the City of Bremerton (FP01153) is $959,573, and the total loan amount offered to the Rosa-Sunnyside Board of Joint Control (FP01051) is $10,000,000.
Because of issues associated with project prerequisite approvals, three projects shown on the Draft IUP, Kitsap County (FP01142), Kitsap County (FP01145), and Thurston County (FP01185), are not eligible for funding consideration and are shown in the not-ranked portion of the list.
The Thurston County (FP01185) Cooper Point Wastewater Facilities Construction Project was determined to be ineligible for funding due to compliance issues associated with the Growth Management Act.
The Western Washington Growth Management Hearings Board has ruled that this project does not comply with Thurston County's Comprehensive Plan.
Thurston County has indicated that it will appeal the Hearings Board decision and the project will remain ineligible for funding consideration until resolution of this issue occurs.
Kitsap County Public Works (FP01142) - During the public review and comment period a citizens group appealed the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared for the project and consequently the County is going to prepare a Supplemental EIS.
Because the environmental is incomplete the Ecology rescinded the approval of the facilities plan.
Kitsap County Public Works (FP01145) - This project was deemed approvable by Ecology prior to the close of the application period.
However, during the public review and comment period a citizens group appealed the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared for the project and consequently the County is going to prepare a Supplemental EIS.
Because the
Â·
Â·
Â·
Â·
Page 11 of 17
Â· Â· Â·
EIS was appealed and the County is now going to prepare a supplemental EIS the Ecology did not approve the facilities plan.
Four projects received 10 additional local prioritization points due to the determination that a higher priority project in WRIA 13 was ineligible.
Local prioritization points were adjusted for the City of Lacey (FP01205; FP01208, FP01209; FP01210) projects.
Two projects received local prioritization points due to a reconsideration of local prioritization points for WRIA 6.
Local prioritization points were awarded for the Town of Coupeville (FP01028; FP01030) Two projects not proposed for funding on the Draft IUP are offered SRF loan funding on the Final IUP. SRF loan funds became available when a previously proposed project was determined to be ineligible for funding, two applicants declined proposed loans, and the addition of deobligated funds from previous funding cycle recipients.
The two projects are FP01030 (Coupeville 1999 Comprehensive Sewer Plan, Refinancing) and FP01094 (Clinton Water Dist. Comprehensive Sewer Plan).
E. Comments From External Parties Bremerton, City of, Lynn Horton, Mayor, project numbers FP01150, FP01151, FP01153, and FP01154, comment: The City wrote two letters to Ecology.
One of the letters acknowledged acceptance of the proposed loan funding for the Anderson Cove CSO Reduction Facilities Project.
However, the loan amount was less than the full request and the City is hopeful that the full amount can be provided.
Concern was also raised regarding the City's ability to comply with the combined sewer overflow reduction schedule identified in a current Ecology consent decree considering a reduced level of funding for the proposed project.
The second letter from the City asks that Ecology reconsider the assignment of priority points for the four submitted projects in light of what was believed to be an inappropriate point spread in several question areas.
Response: The City has expressed its willingness to accept a reduced level of funding for the Anderson Cove CSO Project (FP01153).
Staff are pleased to note that the applicant will be offered partial funding of $959,573 for the project.
Additional SRF funding may be available and may be offered to the applicant in the future based on is present rank among proposals statewide.
Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposals and point assignments.
Staff will be working to limit scoring variability, wherever possible, during subsequent funding cycles.
However, staff found that information provided by the applicant for the two projects where detailed comments were provided, that scores were within the range of acceptable variation, given the different perspectives of evaluators (discussed in the Public Review and Comment section item C); or information in the proposal supported the lower of the two evaluation scores.
Among the question areas where the difference in evaluator perspective was particularly apparent were II-D (Impaired aquatic species, principally endangered or threatened), and II-I and J (Water Quality Standards violated and in jeopardy of being violated).
These questions were designed to allow the evaluators to use their professional judgement of the information provided in the proposal to assign priority points.
Page 12 of 17
Regarding Question area II-K the Mayor agreed with evaluator's comment that Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) actions are not identified yet.
Where such was the case, priority points should not have been assigned by either evaluator.
However, in fairness to all applicants, staff decided not to lower any applicant's score based on the reconsideration of scores requested.
Regarding proposed special financial assistance consideration for enforcement related projects, throughout the life of these funding programs; staff have, and appropriately continue, to separate enforcement actions from the provision of financial assistance.
The priority system addresses this issue by assigning equal weight to remediation and prevention project proposals.
The applicant received full credit for addressing the Consent Decree in all four projects in question.
Although no specific information was provided regarding two of the proposals (FP01150 and FP001154), staff reviewed the respective scores and found the priority points assigned were very consistent.
No priority point adjustments were made for any of these four proposals reconsidered.
Cooper Point Alliance, Jolene Unsoeld, project number FP01185, comment: The District wrote to ask Ecology not to fund the Cooper Point Wastewater Facilities Construction Project because of compliance issues with the Growth Management Act.
Response: Ecology has determined that Cooper Point Wastewater Facilities Construction Project is ineligible until issues associated with the Growth Management Act have been resolved and the project is ready to proceed.
Coupeville, City of, Larry Harmon, Public Works Director, project number FP01028, comment: The City wrote to Ecology to request a reconsideration the priority points in light of actions between the Town and Ecology staff, as it relates to the City's longer term financial assistance strategy.
The City is also requesting a reconsideration of the points awarded relative to the 1999 Comprehensive Plan, and question area II-C (Primary Contact Recreation), and Question area IV-B (Pollution Prevention), and the Local Priority-Setting Process.
Response: Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposals and point assignments.
Staff believe it is not surprising to see a comprehensive planning project proposal receive more points than one of the projects called for in the plan, as most comprehensive planning projects address numerous water quality problems and set the stage for several implementation projects to be developed.
As Question II-C parenthetically explains, primary contact recreation is limited to swimming and water skiing.
Regarding point assignments for pollution prevention, points were assigned the way other proposals were evaluated by both evaluators.
Local prioritization points for this project, along with others in WRIA 6, were re-evaluated (see response for Island County Public Works).
With the addition of local prioritization points for this project, Ecology staff are pleased to note that the applicant will be offered full funding.
Page 13 of 17
Enumclaw, City of, Chris Searcy, Public Works Director, project number FP01102, comment: The City wrote to ask Ecology for prior authorization associated with the proposed funding for the Enumclaw WWTP Improvements Â­ Planning Project Response: Ecology is unwilling to approve the request for prior authorization in the absence of a final funding offer list.
Because funding amount adjustments become necessary, projects are not assured of funding until a final funding list is prepared.
Applicants proposed for SRF loans can proceed with incurring loan eligible costs for their projects as the SRF program does allow for refinancing of eligible project costs provided all federal requirements are met.
Granger, Town of, David Leach, Mayor, project number FP01026, comment: The City wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the awarding of priority points in light of what was believed to be an inappropriate point spread in several question areas.
The letter acknowledges that Question II-K (Implementation of a TMDL) was answered incorrectly, but requested that points be assigned for this question.
Response: Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposal and point assignments and agree that the answer to Question IV-D (financing project follow up needs) was adequate for the assignment of points.
An additional 20 points were assigned to the final score and the project was re-ranked accordingly.
Reconsideration of the other questions shows that point assignments were within the range of acceptable variation given the different perspectives of evaluators (discussed in the Public Review and Comment section item C).
Before the start of the evaluation process, the evaluators reached a consensus that they would not add substantive information to that provided by applicants.
One of the evaluators initially did so on this project, but as the project was re-evaluated (because of the initial point spread), points were assigned by a third evaluator based on the information provided in the proposal.
Island County Public Works, Larry Kwarsick, Director, project number FP01028 and FP01030, comment: The County wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the denial of local prioritization points for the projects submitted for funding in WRIA 6.
Response: For local prioritization points to be awarded in WRIA 6, seven signatures (Island County, City of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island Conservation District, Holmes Harbor Sewer District, Swinomish Tribe, Tulalip Tribe, and the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe) were required on a Statement of Agreed Priority.
Appendix Q of the FY 2001 Funding Program Guidelines references that if required signatures are missing, points will not be awarded, unless "written proof of reasonable and prudent efforts to notify that group" is provided to Ecology.
Signatures from the Swinomish Tribe and the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribes were not included in the Statement of Agreed Priority.
However, a signature from the Skagit System Cooperative was provided.
Upon further investigation, the Cooperative represents the Swinomish Tribe and the WRIA 6 prioritization committee understood the Cooperative represented the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, as well.
Upon learning that it did not, a signature was provided by the Point No Point Treaty Council, on behalf of the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, to support the priorities established for WRIA 6.
Ecology concurs with this explanation and local prioritization points will be awarded to the projects in WRIA 6.
Page 14 of 17
King County, Wastewater Treatment Division, Don Theiler, Manager, project numbers FP01113, FP01155, and FP01157, comment: The County wrote Ecology to request a funding reconsideration for the Denny Way/Lake Union CSO Control; Denny Way/Lake Union CSO Control Â­ Design (Refinance); Denny Way/Lake Union CSO Control Â­ Construction projects.
Reconsideration was requested in light of what was believed to be an inappropriate point spread in several question areas, particularly Questions II-D and IV-A (Impaired Aquatic Species Habitat and Project Prerequisites, respectively) for all three project proposals.
The applicant also asked that general guidance be provided for establishing a local prioritization process.
Response: Based on comments from the applicant and many others, staff will be providing in regulation (through the rulemaking process) and guidelines, general guidance for local prioritization processes.
Guidance will not be overly prescriptive, as it must be a local process.
Regarding what the applicant believes is an inappropriate disparity of scores, Ecology staff carefully reviewed the proposals and point assignments.
Staff will be working to limit scoring variability, wherever possible, during subsequent funding cycles.
However, staff found that information provided by the applicant for these three projects, that scores were within the range of acceptable variation, given the different perspectives of evaluators (discussed in the Public Review and Comment section item C); or information in the proposal supported considerably less than the requested maximum score available.
Among the question areas where the difference in evaluator perspective was particularly apparent was Question II.D (Impaired aquatic species, principally endangered or threatened).
Furthermore, all evaluators agreed to use general criteria, e.g. spawning and rearing habitat, area of impairment directly linked to the problem to be addressed, etc, in the assignment of these points, and applying these criteria to the information in your proposal, it appears that evaluators were relatively liberal in assigning points to your proposal.
However, in fairness to all applicants, staff decided not to lower any applicant's score based on the reconsideration of scores requested.
Regarding Question IV-A (Project Prerequisites), the applicant unnecessarily provided information in all boxes (see "Special Note" at the beginning of the question).
In so doing, we believe from the evaluation comments, that the applicant may have substantially confused evaluators, especially because the approval status of the various project contracts was very unclear from the information provided.
Any future submittals should clarify this information, and special care should be taken to use all instructions and application tips.
No priority point adjustments were made.
Lynden, City of, Daryl Brennick, Mayor, project number FP01116, comment: The City wrote to Ecology to express its appreciation for proposed funding for the Wastewater Treatment Plant Upgrade/Expansion Project.
Response: Ecology is pleased to be able to provide funding for this project.

Mason Conservation District, Michael Madson, District Manager, project numbers FP01190, FP01211, FP01212, and FP01213, comment: The District wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the denial of local prioritization points for the projects submitted for funding in WRIA 14.
Response: For local prioritization points to be awarded in WRIA 14, five signatures (Mason County, City of Shelton, Mason Conservation District, Squaxin Tribe and Skokomish Tribe) were required on a Statement of Agreed Priority.
Appendix Q of the FY 2001 Funding Program Guidelines references that if required signatures are missing, points will not be awarded, unless "written proof of reasonable and prudent efforts to notify that group" is provided to Ecology.
Although copies of correspondence were provided reflecting efforts to include the Squaxin Tribe, no documentation on efforts to include the Skokomish Tribe was provided.
The District's request for reconsideration acknowledged the missing signature yet no provision was made for its absence.
Failure to include a required entity without explanation does not constitute reasonable or prudent efforts and therefore no local prioritization points will be awarded to the projects in WRIA 14.
Mason County Commissioners, project numbers FP01190, FP01211, FP01212, FP01213, comment: The County Commissioners wrote to ask Ecology to reconsider the denial of local prioritization points for the projects submitted for funding in WRIA 14.
Response: For local prioritization points to be awarded in WRIA 14, five signatures (Mason County, City of Shelton, Mason Conservation District, Squaxin Tribe and Skokomish Tribe) were required on a Statement of Agreed Priority.

Pullman, City of, Mark Workman, Public Works Director, project number FP01012, comment: The City wrote to Ecology to decline the SRF loan amount proposed for the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan Project.
The City is unable to proceed with the project without grant assistance.
Response: Ecology accepts the City's decision and hopes that an application for this project will be re-submitted during the next funding cycle for this project.
Redmond, City of, Jon Spangler, Public Works Department, project number FP01169, comment: The City wrote Ecology to indicate its willingness to accept SRF loan funding for Idylwood Park Stream Restoration Project.
Page 16 of 17
Response: Ecology is pleased that the City will be able to proceed with this project using SRF loan funding.
Rosa-Sunnyside Board of Joint Control, James Trull, Treasurer, project number FP01051, comment: The Board wrote to Ecology to express its willingness to proceed with the On-Farm Irrigation Conversions Project based upon a reduced level of funding as shown on the draft offer list.
Response: Ecology is pleased that this project will be completed with the SRF funding proposed.
Due to eligibility issues, declined funding related with other projects, and the inclusion of funds deobligated from previous funding cycle recipients, Ecology is able to offer the Board the full amount requested on the funding application.
An SRF loan in the amount of $10,000,000 is identified on the Final IUP for this project.
Spokane County Conservation District, Rich Baden, District Administrator, project number FP01085, comment: The District wrote to Ecology indicating its willingness to accept SRF loan funding for the Hangman Creek Clean Water Program Project.
Response: Ecology is pleased that the City will be able to proceed with this project using SRF loan funding.
Squaxin Island Tribe, James Peters, Natural Resources Director, project number FP01190, comment: The Tribe wrote Ecology in support of the North Bay/Case Inlet Water Reclamation Facilities Project as the #1 priority for WRIA 14 Response: Ecology is pleased to hear from the Tribe regarding the importance and merits of this project.
Tribal support and project endorsement is highly desired and plays a major role in the local prioritization process.
It is unfortunate that the Squaxin Tribe did not sign the original Statement of Agreed Priority which was submitted for WRIA 14.
Signatures by both the Squaxin and Skokomish Tribes were needed to support the priorities established for all of the WRIA 14 projects to allow local prioritization points to be assigned.
No priority point adjustments were made for any of the project proposals in the WRIA.
Sultan, City of, Roy Bysegger, City Administrator, project number FP01196, comment: The City wrote to Ecology to express its willingness to accept SRF loan funding for the Surface Water Quality Management Plan Project.
Response: Ecology is pleased to be able to provide SRF funding for this project.
