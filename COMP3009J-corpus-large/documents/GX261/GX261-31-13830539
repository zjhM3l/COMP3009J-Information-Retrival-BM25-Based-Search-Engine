Medical Insurance Company: Policy Number: Page 9 Dothan Composite Squadron Civil Air Patrol Membership Orientation Checklist The Cadet Protection Program Civil Air Patrol (CAP) members involved in the cadet program and pare nts of cadets should be alert to situations in which cadets could be subject to abuse.
A CAP Manual, CAPM 50-16, Chapter 1, Section B, sets policy and guidance in this difficult area.
The area of sexual abuse or molestation of young people by adults is particularly sensitive and difficult.
Those who molest children (pedophiles) are almost impossible to detect in advance.
CAP has very limited administrative capability and must rely on the cooperation of its commander, CAP leaders, the parents of cadets and the cadets themselves.
Cadet Protection Policy: CAP is concerned for the welfare of its cadets and as part of its cadet protection program has adopted these policies.
Civil Air Patrol strictly prohibits abuse of cadets.
For the purpose of this policy, abuse is defined in three categories: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Emotional abuse: Cadets will not be subjected to excessive discipline or humiliating or emotionally distressing verbal abuse.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Physical abuse: Cadets will not be physically struck, hazed or assaulted in any way.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sexual abuse: Cadets will not be subject to sexual molestation, touching, contacts, exposure, suggestions or other incidents of a sexually orientated nature Senior members, cadets and parents/guardians should immediately report incidents of observed or suspected abuse to the unit commander or the commander at the next higher level of command.
Whenever a commander receives a report of abuse, suspects that abuse has occurred or may occur, or believes there is an appearance of impropriety involving cadet abuse by a member of Civil air Patrol, the commander will immediately suspend the member from working with cadets and will report the abuse according to Civil Air Patrol Guidance contained in CAPM 50-16 The Protection Program Overview: Civil Air Patrol, as part of its Cadet Protection Program, has adopted these general guidelines for volunteer leaders.
CAP has adopted a mandatory screening program of senior members as part of their effort to prevent abuse.
All senior members on entry must be fingerprinted and those prints are sent to the FBI for review of arrests and convictions - if any.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ CAP leaders should exercise good judgment and discretion when selecting senior members, cadets, and other persons to conduct or supervise cadet activities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage members to report any observed or suspected abuse Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ensure at least two senior members for each gender of cadet are present at all overnight activities.
This two person rule is for the protection of the senior member as well as for the cadet.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conduct periodic orientation for senior members so that all are aware of the Cadet Protection Program policy.
CAP encourages parents and guardians to get involved in the following ways: Talk to your son or daughter every day and take time to really listen and observe.
Learn as many details as you can about their activities and feelings.
Encourage him or her to share concerns and problems with you.
Tell your child that some adults may try to intimidate children and make them do things that the child doesn't feel comfortable doing.
Often these adults call what they're doing a secret between themselves and the child.
Explain that his or her body belongs only to them alone and that he or she has the right to say no to anyone who might try to touch them.
Civil Air patrol encourages periodic parents' meetings to discuss the subject of child abuse and CAP's efforts in protecting the cadet.
Personally meet the unit commander, cadet commander, chaplain., and other senior member staff.
Do not hesitate to contact them about questions or concerns you or your child have.
Keep informed of official activities through official CAP squadron and wing calendar of events and CAP written notices.
Emotional Abuse: The guidelines concerning protection of cadets from emotional and physical abuse are discussed in the concept of likely situation where such types of abuse could occur.
Emotional abuse is more difficult to define because the range of its Page 10 Dothan Composite Squadron Civil Air Patrol Membership Orientation Checklist effects if very broad.
Within Civil Air Patrol, the form of emotional abuse most likely to occur is humiliating or distressing verbal abuse.
Young people tend to abuse one another through unkind words, ridicule, and sarcastic criticism.
This abuse comes from the cadet's environment.
CAP leaders should be aware of this type of abuse, and as part of le adership training, attempt to use words that accent the positive and help cadets feel better about themselves.
Development of self-discipline is also a part of leadership training.
CAP leaders are aware that discipline within the cadet squadron is necessary for a cohesive, functional group.
Likewise the leaders also know that excessive or humiliating discipline does not develop positive leadership characteristics that give the cadet the confidence and tools to become and effective and responsible leader and citizen.
Physical Abuse: Physical abuse is easier to recognize than the other forms of abuse.
The presence of bruises, broken bones, lacerations, puncture marks, swollen areas, or combinations of these factors are signs of physical abuse.
Usually tow patterns develop wherein the child becomes shy, withdrawn, passive and uncommunicative, or the child may be nervous, hyperactive, aggressive, disruptive and destructive.
The child may also begin to abuse others.
In the development of the cadet, our leadership training is designed to help the passive type individual gain confidence in his or her abilities.
On the other hand, the aggressive type individual learns how teamwork and concern for others foresters confidence in their leadership capabilities.
Thus, our protection program forbids excessive discipline, physically striking or hazing (to harass by banter, ridicule, criticism, or torment) of any cadet.
Sexual Abuse: The difficulty of preventing sexual abuse in any youth organization such as CAP cannot be overstated.
While there are numerous experts in this field almost all agree that detecting pedophiles in advance is almost impossible.
We must solicit the assistance of parents to participate in the program and educate their children.
Resources for More Information The following is a list of some national resources for additional information on the subject of child abuse.
We encourage CAP leaders and parents to become informed of this exceptionally important issue in today's society.
