May 1998 NF-220 The Earth Science Enterprise Series These articles consider Earth's many dynamic processes and their interactions.
Volcanoes and Global Climate Change Volcanoes and Global Cooling Figure 1 illustrates that as volcanoes erupt, they blast huge clouds into the atmosphere.
These clouds are made up of particles and gases, including sulfur dioxide.
Millions of tons of sulfur dioxide gas can reach the stratosphere from a major eruption.
There, the sulfur olcanic gases are thought to be responsible for the global cooling that has sometimes been observed for a few years after a major eruption.
The amount and global extent O3 of the cooling depend on the force of the eruption, CI2 the amount of particular ATMOSPHERIC SO +H O HCI gases emitted, and, H2SO4 22 CHEMISTRY perhaps, on the location H2O of the volcano with RADIATIVE TRANSFER ASH, SO2 respect to the world's global atmospheric CLIMATE MODELS circulation patterns.

V sary).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2Ã¯Â¿Â½ dioxide converts to tiny persistent sulfuric acid (sulfate) particles, referred to as aerosols.
These sulfate particles reflect energy coming from sun, thereby decreasing the amount of sunlight reaching and heating the Earth's surface.
Short term global cooling often has been linked with some major volcanic eruptions.
The year 1816 has been referred to as "the year without a summer."
It was a time of significant weather-related disruption in New England and in Western Europe with killing summer frosts in the United States and Canada.
These strange phenomena were attributed to a major eruption of the Tambora volcano in 1815 in Indonesia.
The volcano threw sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, and the aerosol layer that formed led to brilliant sunsets seen around the world for several years.
But, not all volcanic eruptions, not even all lar ge volcanic eruptions, produce global-scale cooling.
Mount Agung in 1963 apparently caused a considerable decrease in temperatures around much of the world, whereas El ChichÃ¯Â¿Â½n in 1982 seemed to have little effect, perhaps because of its different location or because of the El NiÃ¯Â¿Â½o that occurred the same year.
(See NASA Facts NF-211.)
El NiÃ¯Â¿Â½o is a Pacific Ocean phenomenon, but it causes worldwide weather variations that may have acted to cancel out the effect of the El ChichÃ¯Â¿Â½n eruption.
Volcanoes and Ozone Depletion Another possible effect of a volcanic eruption is the destruction of stratospheric ozone.
Researchers now are suggesting that aerosol particles containing sulfuric acid from volcanic emissions may contribute to ozone loss.
When chlorine compounds resulting from the breakup of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the stratosphere are present, the sulfate particles may serve to convert them into more-active Figure 2.

Monitoring the Effects of Volcanoes Space-based instruments are the only practical way to observe large and transitory volcanic eruption clouds.
NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments have contributed significantly to our knowledge of the total amount of sulfur dioxide emitted into the atmosphere in the course of major volcanic eruptions.
Figure 2 shows TOMS images of sulfur dioxide spreading across the Indian Ocean region following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.
Several weeks later the sulfur dioxide had spread around the world as observed by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) (see Figure 3).
In addition to detecting the sulfur dioxide from Mount Pinatubo, TOMS has made similar observations of more than 100 volcanic events, including a major eruption from the Cerro Hudson volcano in Chile in 1991.
TOMS instruments were launched on a Nimbus-7 spacecraft in 1978; a Russian Meteor-3 spacecraft in 1991; and on the Earth Probe and the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing System (ADEOS) platforms in 1996.
A TOMS instrument is also scheduled to fly on a Russian-3M satellite in 2000.
Data from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE II) instrument on NASA's Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) have shown that during the first five months after the Mount Pinatubo eruption, the optical depth of the stratospheric aerosol increased up to 100 times in certain locations.
Optical depth is a general measure of the capacity of a region of the atmosphere to prevent the passage of visible light through it.
Greater optical depths mean greater blockage of the light.
In this case, the increased optical depth means that considerably less of the sun's energy can get through the cloud to warm the Earth's surface.
An advanced SAGE III instrument, which will make similar observations, is scheduled to be launched on a Russian Meteor-3M spacecraft in the second half of 1998.
A few years after an eruption most of the aerosol clouds will have decayed so that their effects on radiation will become negligible.
Observations of the effects of Mt. Pinatubo aerosols on global climate have been used to validate scientists' understanding of climate change and our ability to predict future climate.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4Ã¯Â¿Â½ Institute for Space Studies in New York city have applied their general circulation model of Earth's climate to the problem.
They have reported success in correctly predicting many of the effects of the sulfate aerosols from Mount Pinatubo's eruption on lowering global temperatures.
NASA Missions to Study Volcanoes Some of NASA's past and present missions that contribute to the study of volcanoes are listed in the accompanying table.
Included in the table is the Earth Observing System (EOS), the key element of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise.
The first launch in the series of EOS satellites is scheduled to take place in 1998.
The High Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIR), first flown on NASA's Nimbus-1 satellite in 1964, has been used to observe both active and dormant volcanoes.
On Nimbus-2, HRIR recorded energy changes from the volcanic activity on Surtsey, Iceland in 1966.
The Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) instruments on the Landsat satellites have provided a long series of images of volcanic activity, such as venting, volcanic ash falls, and lava flows.
The EOS program will incorporate a series of satellites that will carry advanced instruments to provide a highly-accurate, self-consistent, and long-term data base of many aspects of Earth's atmosphere, land, and ocean characteristics.
The information gained from this major effort to study Earth phenomena will expand our knowledge of the interactions of volcanoes with Earth's climate.
