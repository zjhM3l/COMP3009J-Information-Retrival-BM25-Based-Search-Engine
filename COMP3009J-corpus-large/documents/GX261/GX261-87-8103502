Your driver license is important to you.
Having a driver license is a privilege, so treat it with care.
This chapter tells you how to get a driver license and how to keep it up-to-date.
By the end of this section, you should know how to apply for a license, the tests you must pass to get a driver license, some reasons for failure and a sample test.

The applicants are required to demonstrate responsible driving behavior in each stage of licensing before advancing to the next stage.
If 16 years or older, the three stages include the student permit, provisional license and basic license; for applicants 17 years or older, the two stages include an examination permit and a basic license.
The listed steps in each stage are explained in the following GDL section.
Just the facts Studies show a 5 to 16 percent reduction in crashes for young drivers in states with the GDL program.
Insurance companies, automobile associations, federal and state safety organizations, physicians' groups and police support this program for this reason.
Graduated Driver License (GDL) New Jersey joins 23 other states and several Canadian provinces in 2001 by implementing a multi-stage driver licensing system.
The new system introduces driving privileges gradually to first time drivers and applicants under 21 years, extends their practice driving time and raises the unrestricted basic driver license age from 17 to 18 years.

New Jersey's Graduated Driver License PROGRAM The road to becoming a safe new driver
What is it?
New Jersey's Graduated Driver License (GDL) is a program teen and first-time drivers must complete to get their unrestricted basic driver license.
The Graduated Driver License law comes into effect January 1, 2001.
Why have it?
The program is designed to reduce the number of driving fatalities among teen and first-time drivers and their passengers.
By having more experience, new drivers will be more capable of handling all types of driving situations.
How does it work?
Depending on your age, choose the route to get an unrestricted basic driver license.

Examination permits for NJ residents Any New Jersey resident who is at least 17 years old and is not in suspension status can obtain a driver examination permit at any MVS agency.
The exam permit is different from a student permit because you don't have to be a student and an instructor is not necessary.
Note: You need a driver examination permit although you hold a valid license from another state.
See below for details.
After you fill out the form with your legal name and present in English proof of age, identity, name change, if applicable, and proof that the U.S. government authorizes your presence in this country, you can purchase a permit to take to the nearest driver testing center.
Basic automobile license applicants must supply their Social Security number, or an exemption from the Social Security Administration.
Note: Most agencies conduct written and vision tests.
For more information, please call general customer information at (888) 486-3339 toll free in New Jersey or (609) 292-6500 from out of state.
MVS will validate the permit for practice driving after you pass the required vision and written tests, explained in Chapter 2.
A NJ driver with a valid license, who has been licensed for three years or more, 21 years or older, in the same classification as your learner 's permit must accompany you when you practice drive.
Basic (auto) driver permits expire in two years; therefore, if you do not pass your road test within two years you can renew the permit at no cost to you.
See Chapter 2 for information about road tests.
Examination permits for out-of-state or out-of-country drivers All nonresident drivers are required within 60 days as permanent New Jersey residents, or when their out-of-state licenses expire, whichever comes first, to purchase examination permits.
Nonresidents under 18 years are subject to the GDL requirements (see pp. 3-6).
If they wish to apply for a New Jersey license they should follow the steps outlined for special permit and examination holders.
To purchase the permit, go to any MVS agency, show the required proofs
6
of age, identity, name change if applicable (see below) and take the written test and vision screening.
If you pass, you must surrender your out-of-state driver license before MVS issues you a New Jersey examination permit or driver license.
If you are 18 or older, you may be exempt from the road test.
Noncitizens must show formal proof that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has authorized their presence in this country under federal law, and allows licensing or the issuance of a nondriver identification card.
Persons with temporary visa status who may apply for NJ driver licenses include: treaty traders; students and their families; temporary workers, accompanying spouses and minor children; foreign information representatives and their families; exchange visitors and their families; fiancees and their children; intracompany transfers, accompanying spouses and minor children; students in nonacademic and vocational schools and family members; persons with temporary protection from deportation; Canadians temporarily U.S. residents; religious ministers and spouses; parents of U.S. citizens; international athletes or entertainment groups; and persons in a reciprocal exchange program.
Students and their families on a visa must show INS Form I-20, student identification cards or certification on school letterhead indicating status.
Note: Foreign drivers may use their native driver licenses as proof of driving experience if their countries are members of the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, and if the applicants have their licenses translated into English by a consulate or an MVS approved translator.
International Driving Permit (IDP) Visitors with a foreign driver license who travel to the United States should carry an IDP or attach an acceptable English translation to their national driver licenses.
The IDP is translated into the official languages of the United Nations (including English) and is useful in traffic emergencies.
Noncitizens must obtain the IDP in their native country before they travel to the United States.
New Jersey drivers who travel to foreign countries may obtain an IDP application through their local American Automobile Association (AAA).
Note: A driver must carry a valid driver license.
Although it is an official document, the IDP cannot replace a driver license, but can be used in conjunction with the license to provide an additional source of driver identification and span foreign language barriers.
Proofs of age and identity All NJ driver license applicants must present proofs of age, identity and that their presence in this country is authorized under federal law.
MVS may recheck your proofs at any time during the licensing process.
MVS will accept current out-of-state driver licenses and New Jersey driver licenses if expired less than three years for the permit issuance and road test waiver, but you must produce one of the proofs on the next page to obtain a NJ driver license.

Just the facts Your NJ driver license is important.
When you receive your license, sign it and check the back if you are a member of the organ donor program.
Be sure to renew on time.
Organ Donor Program/ Uniform Anatomical Gift Act The State of New Jersey and the U.S. Government passed the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act.
This allows an individual to donate his/her organs upon death for the purpose of transplantation or medical research.
The success rates for all types of transplants are excellent.
By donating your organs upon death, you can save a life.
Anyone age 18 or over, and those under age 18, with the consent of a parent or guardian, may be considered for organ donation.
To donate the gift of life to another human being, follow these steps: Â· Make the decision to donate.
Discuss it with your family and/or next of kin.
It's important they understand your decision.
They'll be contacted in the event of your death.
Â· Check the back of your driver license, specifying the organ(s) you are willing to donate.
Â· Express your desire to donate in a will or on a donor card (witnessed by two people).
Checking your license is simply a declaration of your intent to be a donor.
To obtain a donor card, or for more information about organ and tissue transplantation, please call the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network at (800) Share-NJ.
15
Renewal of licenses You must carry your valid license when driving, so it's important that you renew your license before it expires.
If you do not renew your license for three years or are not allowed to renew because of a license suspension, you must reapply and retake the vision, written and road tests.
It is up to you, therefore, to renew your license.
If you do not get a renewal form by mail, renew your license in person at any agency.
Make sure you take your expiring or expired license, your Social Security number and proof of identity with you.
See the list of agencies in the back of this book and "Proofs of age and identity" on p. 7.
When you renew your basic license, you must also renew the endorsements (motorcycle, commercial vehicle, boat) to drive or operate the endorsed vehicle.
The new license will contain only motor vehicle information and display a tamper proof color picture of the licensee.
If you enter the military and have a valid New Jersey license, renew your license before it expires.
Voter registration form To expedite the voter registration process, MVS sends voter registration applications with all driver license renewals and changes of address.
The forms are also available at MVS agencies.
