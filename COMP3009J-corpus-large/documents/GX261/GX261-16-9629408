discussion, and some actions and activities that are simply noteworthy because they have had, or they probably will have a significant impact on VT.
The Vanishing Treasures Initiative began in 1993, when the National Park Service identified several critical weaknesses that were threatening the existence of unique, rare, and irreplaceable prehistoric and historic ruins.
In Fiscal Year 1998, Congress began allocating funds to the National Park Service (NPS) to begin addressing the preservation needs of hundreds and thousands of significant archeological/architectural sites at over 44 National Park Service units Adobe Mason Ray Madril from Tumacacori National Historical Park, AZ. repairs 700- year- old adobe walls at Casa Grande in the arid west.
This has included Ruins National Monument, AZ. funds to address emergency and high priority preservation projects, and funds to begin establishing a permanent full time FY 2002/2003 Year End Report workforce in a number of parks.
To insure a full accounting of the use of VT funds, an annual year- end report has been produced each fiscal year since 1998.
Each report provides detailed documentation of the activities and accomplishments of the Program.
To date, five detailed year- end reports, including this one, have been produced documenting the expenditure of funds, the projects completed, the personnel hired since 1998, and the accomplishments and activities of the individuals hired.
To further insure the dissemination of the accomplishments and accountability of the Initiative, a VT Web Page has been established on the National Park Service Web site.
It can be accessed from the Archeology and Ethnography This document provides a report on the expenditures and accomplishments of the Vanishing Treasures Program in FY 2002.
It includes specific information on expenditure of program funds, an accounting of preservation treatment projects implemented in a select number of VT parks, and it presents a report on the personnel that have been hired with VT funds since FY 1998 and their accomplishments in FY 2002.
It also provides information regarding the proposed use of funds in FY 2003 and some projections for FY 2004 and beyond.
Finally, the document provides an update on the activities of the Program's Leadership, Advisory and Workgroups.

Report Compilation Consistent with the nature of the Program, this document represents the input an assistance of a large number of individuals.
The VT Program Coordinator and the Database Workgroup Leader, Al Remley compiled the document.
Section's 6 and 7 of the report were compiled and edited by Lyle Balenquah and Lloyd Masayumptewa, the Flagstaff Area National Monument's FY 2000 and FY 2001 VT hires.
Additional proofing of the report was completed by Flagstaff Areas Archeologists Ian Hough, Jane Lakeman, and Jessica Bland.
Any errors of omission or inaccuracies in what is presented are the sole responsibility of the VT Program Coordinator.
Credit for the bulk (or the bulky part) of the document deservedly goes to a number of individuals that had the dubious honor of having to keep track of either the accomplishments of personnel that were hired with VT funds in their park, the projects that were being completed in their park also with VT funds, or both.

compliment and coordinate with VT's Structure Engineer position.
For the duration of the Program, funding will be sought for high priority and emergency projects, to recruit and train craftspecialists, to recruit and train experts such as archeologists, engineers, and historical architects, and for management, oversight, and accountability.
To date, the VT Program is approximately one third of the way through our initial projections for hiring and appropriate 16% of the total project funding originally projected for VT through FY 2003.
More specific information regarding VT Program Funding can be found in subsequent sections of this report.
Information regarding completed projects, activities, and accomplishments is presented in detail in subsequent sections of this report.
Suffice it to say that a great deal was accomplished by the staff that has been hired, the other NPS staffers that either have responsibility for, or work on VT resources, and through the projects that were implemented with VT funds.
Accomplishments in Brief With the close of FY 2002, approximately $7,002,000 will have been used to conduct projects, hire, and train personnel, and to manage the program.
Of that amount, approximately $3,959,000 will have been dedicated to completing 65 emergency and high priority projects in 27 parks, $2,781,000 will have been used to hire 48 preservation specialists in 22 parks, $32,000 will have been used for training, and $230,000 will have been devoted to managing the program.
At the close of FY 2003 it is expected that an additional $1,031,000 will be appropriated to conduct and additional 13 projects, $600,000 will have been used to hire an additional 6 individuals in 5 parks, and $60,000 will have been used for program management.
With the close of FY 2003, a grand total of $8,693,000 will have been appropriated to VT.
This includes approximately $4,989,500 used to complete 78 emergency and high priority projects in 30 parks; $3,381,000 appropriated to hire 56 preservation specialists in 22 parks, and $290,800 devoted to program management.
This calculates out to approximately 57% of the total VT budget received devoted to conducting projects, 39% dedicated to the hiring of personnel, and 3% used for the management of the program.
Two of the positions that will be hired in FY 2003 include a full time Program Coordinator Mummy Cave Pueblo, a 13th century ancestral puebloan site.

Significant Events of Note Beyond the phenomenal accomplishments by VT personnel and through the projects that were implemented, there were a number of significant events and occurrences in FY 2002 and early FY 2003 that have influenced or impacted VT both encouragingly and detrimentally.
A brief summary is presented below: In FY 2002, three Pacific West Region parks were brought into the VT Program because they contain resources that met the definition of a VT resource.
These parks were eligible to compete for VT project funding beginning in FY 2003, and it is likely that a least two of them will receive project funding in FY 2003.
Despite the good success and a strong interest on the part of all VT personnel to have an annual conference, we were unable to hold the FY 2002 conference due to restrictions on the use of travel funds.
VT leadership is strongly committed to the conferences and will work diligently to see what can be done to continue to hold them on a yearly basis.
Although the issue of outsourcing started out looking as if it would have a significant impact on VT and the ability to hire folks in FY 2002, we were able to prepare sufficient justifications for parks to complete their hiring.
It does look however, as if we will be preparing additional justifications for existing and any proposed VT positions in the near future as the NPS as a whole begins to address the outsourcing issue.
Regrettably, we have to inform you about the loss of one of our VT personnel.
Houston Rogers, a VT
archeologist at Tumacacori National Historical Park in Arizona, passed away on December 22, 2002 in a motorcycle accident near the park.
We have dedicated this report to Houston and a brief tribute can be found on the inside back cover of this report.
Final Thoughts With every year- end report we hope and generally expect that you'll spend some time in reviewing this document and the separate Management Summary that has been prepared.
We feel that both documents contain important information on the expenditures and accomplishments of VT.
While we are far from our initial projections, progress has clearly been made and we have most certainly been faithful to our original goals and objectives as there were formulated well over 9 years ago.
Clearly however, much work still remains in order to meet our original goals.
The next few years will pose new and imposing obstacles both in our ability to hire new personnel in parks, in our ability to retain the staff that has already been hired, and in our ability to insure that funding is available to conduct projects.
We are confident however, that the work that is being done and the personnel that have and are proposed to be hired to conduct VT work will be viewed as a "core" and" essential" to the mission of the National Park Service and that the work of the Vanishing Treasures Initiative will be perceived as an "inherently governmental" responsibility.

Section 2 - Program Funding This section is a detailed discussion of expenditures that Vanishing Treasure has received since FY 1998, the first fully funded year of the program.
Including funds appropriated in FY 2003, the program has received funding for six straight years, and efforts are underway to develop a budget for VT for inclusion in the President's FY 2004 budget.
Table 2.1 provides the total amount and a breakdown of funding that has been allocated to VT since FY 1998 through FY 2003.
The table identifies the increases that have been provided to VT over the last six years and where funds have been distributed to the primary funding components (projects, program management, and base increases for personnel).
Vanishing Treasures has enjoyed increases in its budget that average a little over $746,000 for the last five years.
These increase have made available an average annual operating budget of slightly over $1.45 million.
With the close of FY 2003, approximately $8,693,000 will have been appropriated to VT to conduct projects, hire and train personnel, and to manage the program.
Of that amount, approximately $4,989,500 will have been dedicated to completing 78 emergency and high priority projects in 30 parks; $3,393,000 will have been used to hire 56 preservation specialists in 22 parks, this includes replacing an aging work force and recruiting and training new individuals; $31,700 will have been used for training; and $290,800 will have been devoted to management of the program.
This works out to roughly 57% of the total VT budget received to date being devoted to conducting projects, approximately 39% will have been dedicated to the hiring of personnel, and 3% will have been used for the management of the program.
More specific information regarding the personnel hired and the associated costs, and the projects that have been completed, specifically in FY 2002, can be found in subsequent sections of this report.
The following provides a specific accounting of how VT funding has been utilized since FY 1998 and what is being proposed for FY 2003.
FY 1998 Funding for the first year of the program was $1.0 million.
Of that amount $505,300 was used to address emergency preservation projects, $484,700 was used to recruit and train 11 craftspeople and preservation specialists in 8 parks, and $10,000 was used for program management.
A summary on state- by- state basis is presented below.
New Mexico In FY 1998, $117,000 was used to hire 3 individuals in 2 parks.
This included Aztec Ruins (2 positions) and Salinas Pueblo Missions (one position).
Approximately $233,000 was made available to three parks to conduct high priority projects.
The benefiting parks included Aztec Ruins, Chaco Culture, and Salinas Pueblo Missions.

Advisory and Workgroup Meetings: Funds were utilized to cover the costs of the Advisory Group to travel to Denver, Colorado in March 2002 to rate and prioritize the FY 2003 VT project submittals.
Funds were also provided to cover the costs of the Career Development Workgroup to travel to Denver on November 2001, to continue developing effective methods for the recruitment of new VT employees.
Vanishing Treasures Conference: While the bulk of the expense for the VT Conference that was held in Tumacacori were covered using FY 2001 funds, some FY 2002 funds were used to help cover the travel costs of a select number of VT park staff so that they could attend and participate in the conference.
No funds were dedicated to the FY 2002 conference that was suppose to be held in San Antonio due to its cancellation.
Presentations: Funds were utilized by the Program Coordinator to give a presentation at the Society for American Archeology meetings held in Denver, Colorado in April 2002, and to attend the Annual Arizona State Historic Preservation Office/National Park Service meetings held in Tucson, Arizona in November 2001.
VT Briefings: Program Management funds were utilized to cover the costs of the Chair, Program Coordinator, and two to four members of the Leadership Committee to travel to Washington, D.C. in April and September 2002.
The purpose of these trips was to provide information to NPS Washington Office staff and Congressional members and their staff on the activities and accomplishments of VT.
Program Support: A limited amount of funds was used to purchase supplies and materials used by the Vanishing Treasures Program Coordinator and Budget Analyst to support day- to- day operations.
This included the production and distribution of the FY 2001/2002 Year- End Report (printing of the report, 4 page management summary, report mailing and distribution), and limited products developed by the various Work Groups (project priority lists, VT's inventory and condition assessment database, Web page development, etc.).
Program Management funds were made available to the VT Structural Engineer to purchase supplies
and materials that will be used to assist parks with their structural Engineering needs.
In addition, funds were made available for travel to a select number of parks to assist in addressing their structural engineering needs.
Workshops: VT funds were used to support three workshops: two that were held in Blanding, Utah in March and November, 2002, and one that was held at the Kinishba Ruin, on the White Mountain Apache Reservation in northern Arizona in June, 2002.
FY 2003 Program Management Funds: Program Management funds in FY 2003 will again be $60,000.
It is expected that the funds will be utilized in a manner similar to what has been described above.
FY 2004 and Beyond Based on projections presented in VT's 1998 LongRange Plan, at the end of FY 2003 we were hoping to have dedicated a little over $30 million for conducting projects, and approximately $6.7 million to hire 135 personnel.
In actuality, at the end of FY 2003 we will have used just under $5.0 million to conduct projects and $3.4 million to hire 56 personnel.
What these figures point out is that we have made significant progress towards addressing the preservation needs of a number of Vanishing Treasure resources.
This has included conducting a substantial number of projects and the hiring of a number of permanent staff to address the needs of a significant number of VT resources on a day- to- day basis.
We have, and are continuing to make progress in addressing the goals and objectives of the Initiative as they were outlined in 1998.
What these figures also point out is that we still have a long way to go before we can say that we have finally and fully satisfied the needs and requirements of the Vanishing Treasures Initiative.
It is more important than ever that we do everything possible to insure the sustainability of the VT Program if we want to have any hope of achieving VT's long- range goals.
For us to do this, we must remain vigilant in how we use the VT funds that have been made available to us.
We must have accountability.
Without this, the

program will soon lose its credibility, and any support and interest that the program has garnered will certainly be in jeopardy.
We must also continue to work to insure that the program has visibility, that we are not only touting our accomplishments but that we are reminding everyone of the importance of what we are doing and how it fits within the core mission of the National Park Service.
The bottom line is that continued funding is needed for us to conduct projects, and in order for us to continue to hire staff to address the short and long term, day- to- day needs of the Nation's Vanishing Treasures.

Section 3 - Recruitment and Hiring Accomplishments Over the last five years of the Program, 48 individuals have been permanently hired to specifically address the needs of the Vanishing Treasures Initiative.
This has included the competitive conversion of 14 positions and the hiring of 34 "new" individuals.
Conversion positions represent staff that occupied temporary or seasonal positions for an extended period of time that have been given an opportunity to competitively compete for permanent positions.
Many of the individuals in this situation have worked for the NPS as temporary employees for anywhere from 10- 30 years.
The intake positions represent new permanent positions that are needed to address a parks backlog of preservation needs.
One of the positions filled in FY 2000 included VT's first professional support position.
All of these hires have been accomplished by providing funding increases to a benefiting park's operating budget to cover salary costs, with additional funds provided for training.

Retention of the VT Workforce As of this writing, Vanishing Treasures currently has five vacant positions.
The first two vacancies are with a 1998 and a 2000 hire, and are due to two staff members (both at the same park) moving up in their careers and taking positions at other NPS units.
The third and fourth vacancies are with two of the seven positions provided in FY 2002 that have yet to be filled, and are the result of the benefiting parks being faced with unpredictable complications with the recruitment and hiring process.
Of these two, one park has recently been able to fill the vacancy, but the individual will not EOD until March of this year.

Proposed Hiring in FY 2003 In FY 2003, $600,000 will be used for personnel.
Of the $600,000 increase, approximately 414,000 will be made available to hire 6 individuals in 5 parks.
The proposed parks and positions include the following: Hovenweep National Monument (1 intake position, preservation specialist) Canyon de Chelly National Monument (1 intake position, preservation specialist) Flagstaff Area National Monuments (1 intake position, preservation specialist), Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument (2 conversion positions, craft specialist) San Antonio Missions National Historical Park (1 conversion position, craft specialist) The remaining $186,000 of the increase will be used for VT's program coordinator and historical architect positions.
The duty station for the program coordinator position has yet to be determined.
The historical architect position will be duty stationed at Montezuma Castle/Tuzigoot.
Refer to the next section for a brief discussion regarding VT's Professional Support Positions.
At the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2003, $3,381,000 will have been dedicated to hiring a highly qualified and professional workforce, thereby increasing the number of personnel to address the preservation needs of the nation's VT resources.
Once the proposed hiring in FY 2003 has been completed, 56 positions will have been provided to 22 parks.
Refer back to Table 3- 1 for a review of the distribution of personnel that have been hired on a park- by- park and state- by- state basis, beginning in FY 1998 through the current fiscal year (FY 2003).
The structural engineer position was filled in FY 2000 and duty stationed at Mesa Verde.
For the last two years a large number of VT parks have benefited and will continue to benefit from the services of this position.
Refer to Section 5 for detailed information regarding the activities of VT's Structural Engineer.
VT's historical architect position will be filled in FY 2003 if the budget is passed, as it currently exists.
If this occurs we hope to have the selected individual on board as early as the middle of the summer, and by no later than the end of the fiscals.
This position will be duty stationed at Montezuma Castle/Tuzigoot National Monuments.
Due to a variety of circumstances this position will provide services primarily to Arizona parks, but will be available on a limited basis to all VT parks.
One significant addition and change that will occur in FY 2003 will be the establishment of the VT Coordinator position as a full time, permanently funded position.
The duties of the position are currently being performed as a collateral duty by the Chief of Resources at the Flagstaff Area National Monument.
It is expected that this position will be filled through the competitive process and the most qualified individual hired on as soon as the FY 2003 budget is passed.
The individual filling the position is expected to have experience in both cultural resources management and ruins preservation.
The position will be park based and a selection process will be conducted to determine which VT park will become the host park.
Part of the commitment for becoming the host park is to provide the necessary infrastructure and administrative support for the position.
With the establishment of these positions, the VT Program has moved into a position where it has the capability to provide limited professional, expert, and highly specialized advice and assistance to VT Parks to assure appropriate requirements and needs are met.
It is expected that additional VT professional support positions will be identified and personnel recruited to fill them as the program's capabilities improve, and our sophistication in addressing the goals and objectives of the VT Program become more refined.
Professional Support Positions Beginning in FY 2000, VT began hiring personnel to provide professional support services to all or most of the VT parks.
The positions included a structural engineer that was to be duty stationed at Mesa Verde and a historical architect to be duty stationed at Montezuma Castle/Tuzigoot.

The list was initially created to identify the hiring priority needs for the Program beginning in FY 2001 through FY 2006.
It is not reflective of all of the hiring needs of the Program, which is projected to be 150 personnel.
We can say that we have begun to address a little over one- third of the staffing needs that we initially identified at the beginning of the Program In reviewing the list, it should be kept in mind that what is presented always has the possibility of changing.
It is our intention to maintain the fidelity of the list, and Brian Culpepper, archeologist at Aztec Ruins National Monument every effort will be made to insure NM, recording architectural remains at Aztec Ruins, a 13th century that the list sees little or no change.

Since 1998 we've acquired been provided to hire a little less then half of the funds that has allowed us to hire anywhere from 4 original projections.

For the last three years (FY is also recognized, however, that given the needs of 2001- 2003) the average has been 6.
Assuming that equally important and competing interests, the the complexion and emphasis of the federal budget success that VT has enjoyed over the last four years, will be changing in FY 2004, we remain hopeful that both in securing project funding and acquiring base VT will continue to receive funding to address it's increases to hire staff, is significant and by no means hiring needs.

National Park Service or other reconstructed buildings or ruins (i.e., Aztec Great Kiva, Bents Old Fort).
Note: It is acknowledged that often times the traditionally associated communities to whom many of the involved Vanishing Treasures resources/archeological sites hold importance, do not consider them to be unoccupied, out of use, or abandoned.
"Ruins" are considered by some groups to be spiritually inhabited and are considered to be "in use" by virtue of being invoked in prayers, songs, stories, etc.
They are considered dynamic parts of active cultural systems.
While we use the term "ruins" and the associated definition, it is recognize that some communities do not use the term "ruin" nor consider the places to be unoccupied or out of use.

Fernie also assisted Phil with architectural documentation and supervised the preservation crew in Phil's absence.
Training In October, Fernie attended the Vanishing Treasures Conference hosted by Tumacacori NHP where he discussed past and future projects with other park service preservation personnel.
From August 5- August 9, 2002, Fernie attended a Masonry Workshop at Bandelier National Monument.
Here he strengthened his qualifications by discussing and learning new preservation techniques that might be adapted for use at Fort Bowie.
Mesa Verde National Park Kee John and Neill Smith, Masonry Workers Kee John and Neill Smith were both very busy during FY 2002 performing various preservation activities throughout Mesa Verde NP.
They both worked on the following projects.
Housekeeping Typical springtime maintenance activities were undertaken in several sites that are visited by the public.
The cliff dwelling sites are Cliff Palace, Spruce Tree House, Balcony House, Long House and Step House.
Open sites that receive the twiceyearly housekeeping are Sun Temple, Far View House, Coyote Village, Far View Tower, Pipe Shrine House, Cedar Tree Tower, and Mummy Lake.
These general housekeeping activities involve removal of weeds in and around walls since their presence collects moisture against the masonry, as well as regrading and cleaning out the drains at each of these 12 sites.
There are ten mesa top sites at Mesa Verde that are open to public visitation and are protected with modern constructed shelters.
Housekeeping activities at these sites involve raising the protective curtains (and or panels) in the spring and lowering

them in the fall for site protection from winter weather.
These sites underwent a general regrading and vegetation removal along with the application of mothballs to control rodent infestation.
The curtains on the mesa top sites on Chapin Mesa were lowered on the first of July as a precautionary measure due to high fire danger.
Extra time was spent cleaning the sheltered sites on Wetherill Mesa since this was the first year they were open to the public since the Bircher and Pony fires of 2000.
General housekeeping was also conducted at four other sites that are viewed by the public from overlooks but not actively visited.
These sites include Square Tower House, Oak Tree House, Fire Temple, and New Fire House.
The maintenance conducted here involved vegetation removal, checking the drainage and water pour- off systems at each site and spreading mothballs to control rodents.
Vegetation removal and cleaning of drains was done at Mug House as well.
Preservation Maintenance Ruins preservation work was undertaken on key front country sites at Mesa Verde during the 2002 season, as well as backcountry sites.
At Spruce Tree House the interior of the tall faÃ§ade at the north end of the site was completely repointed.
Loose stones around the upper walls of several kivas were reset and various areas in the site received repointing in heavily impacted areas.
Kiva C received some intensive treatment including repointing, repairing the ventilator tunnel and resetting several stones on an upper wall.
Surface repairs were done in the courtyard area above Kivas C and D; Kee John repaired several other earthen floors in the site.
At Cliff Palace preservation activities conducted included repointing in areas actively viewed by the public.
These areas are also the portions of the site that are most heavily impacted by environmental factors such as rain.
Also, the last portion of concrete walkway was removed from around several kivas early in the season.
This concrete was replaced with soil cement.
Post Fire Site Preservation Activities After the Long Mesa Fire in late July- early August, Mesa Verde's preservation crew enhanced
previously established drainage diversions above Spruce Tree House.
This work was done in coordination with the Site Conservation Program's archaeology crews implementing post fire rehabilitation erosion control treatments on the burned watershed above Spruce Tree House.
In addition to this, the preservation crew also assisted in the erosion control treatment at the farming terraces near Cedar Tree Tower.
Backcountry Sites There was no helicopter support available to the preservation crew this season due to the high fire danger.
Because of this, the only backcountry work undertaken by the crew was preservation work at "Mushroom House," site 5MV1504, because it was easily accessible from the road.
All materials were packed in to conduct the treatments.
Site 5MV1500, "Lancaster House" also received treatment to support a hanging wall where the bedrock had eroded away from beneath it.
The main treatments at Lancaster House were done in 2001.
Bracing was also added to a wall at site 5MV542 in Soda Canyon.
Training Kee and Neill, with the rest of the preservation crew attended a weeklong preservation workshop at Kinishba Ruins near Fort Apache, Arizona in June.
In addition, they both attended the Vanishing Treasures Conference held Rio Rico Resort and hosted by Tumacacori NHP.

Angelyn worked a part- time schedule from January- May 2002 (to take graduate courses leading to an MBA at the University of New Mexico) and then returned to Bandelier full time for the summer field season.
Angelyn's unused salary supported Kathy Fiero as the archeologist for the cavate project.
Mary E. Slater, Exhibit Specialist During FY 2002, Mary assisted in preservation work at both Cave Kiva and Tyuonyi Pueblo.
Briefly, Cave Kiva is a very large cavate in Frijoles Canyon that was restored by Edgar Lee Hewett in the early 20th Century.
This site is open to visitation and frequent and severe graffiti vandalism has necessitated the repeated renewal of earthen plaster and sooted wall and ceiling finishes.
Preparatory work included the selection of materials for the earthen plaster.
Soils were sampled from local landscaping suppliers and subjected to simple materials testing to develop a mixture with an optimum clay content and compatible appearance.
Mary worked with Bandelier Facilities Management staff to apply an unamended earthen plaster to the walls and smoke- blacken the ceiling with Ponderosa pine torches.
Mary will continue to monitor Cave Kiva
for new graffiti, whereupon the vandalism is obscured with soil mixtures, soot, or pigments.
At Tyuonyi Pueblo, a 14th century masonry pueblo in Frijoles Canyon, there are 240 exposed ground floor rooms that have been periodically stabilized since Edgar Lee Hewett excavated them in 1908.
Preparatory work included material selection and testing, which established a mortar mixture of two commercially available soils (the same soils as used in the Cave Kiva plaster) with sand and amended with 25% El Rey 200 (similar to Rhoplex).
Rene Laya, a professional mason affiliated with the Intermountain Support Office in Santa Fe (IMSOSF), conducted training of the masonry stabilization crew.
Student interns from local universities and Native American Pueblos were led by Ron Winters, also from IMSO- SF.
By the end of the season, 133 wall faces had been stabilized by repointing and/or resetting stones.
Technical Assistance/Training Mary made a Power Point presentation on the condition assessment of Tyuonyi Pueblo to the DOI Facilities Management Conference held in San Diego in April 2002.
In May 2002, Mary made a presentation on capillary rise to the participants of a seminar on the reburial of archeological sites held at Pecos National Historical Park.
Mary attended the 2001 VT Conference in Rio Rico.
She also participated in a workshop for the maintenance and conservation of public art in Santa Fe, Supervisory training in Albuquerque, and Defensive Driving training at Bandelier.
Chaco Culture National Historical Park Rachel Anderson, Archeologist Just after the beginning of FY 2002, Rachel was selected as the first archeologist to serve on the Carson National Forest Jicarilla Ranger District.
She agreed to stay on at Chaco through the beginning of calendar year 2002 in order to complete the preservation archive database and train a museum technician in data entry.
Although Rachel has been greatly missed by the park and the NPS VT program, she has taken the skills she acquired as a VT archeologist to the National Forest Service.
The Jicarilla District contains spectacular masonry and earthen architectural

structures and in her new position, Rachel has been able to set up preservation, documentation, and compliance programs for key units within this district.
Use of Lapse Funding To continue some of the projects Rachel had developed until the VT position could be filled in early FY03, two specialists were hired.
Carol Shattuck, museum technician, was hired to inventory, organize, and enter preservation documentation records into an automated database.
These records go back through 1990, and although relatively complete, they are so massive that they were difficult to access and use.
The organization of these records, and their entry into an automated system will serve as a template for the tens of thousands of preservation records dating from the 1920s.
Jeremy Moss, a long- term SKEP employee of the park and presently working on his MA in anthropology at University of Wyoming, worked the summer season with the preservation program.
He compiled over 100 condition assessments of VT resources scattered throughout the park.
Additionally, he completed detailed maps of the six backfilled sites and 20 VT structures associated with the Pueblo del Arroyo erosion control and backfilling project.
Finally, the funding that remained from the VT Archeologist lapse was obligated to an ASMIS/GIS program that Steve Bauman at WACC is developing.
His work will begin in FY03 and will involve a detailed inventory of site records, preservation documentation, maps, and other graphic and narrative data included in the site files.
This GIS database will be similar in design to the one he developed for the Glen Canyon NRA VT program.
Roger Moore, Archeologist Roger Moore was selected to fill the vacant VT archaeologist position at Chaco Canyon NHP in FY03.
Roger has a BA from Ohio State University and an MA from Eastern New Mexico University.
Before moving to the Southwest in 1975, Roger worked several years on excavations of sites representing various culture periods in Ohio, Illinois and Tennessee, including Cahokia Mounds State Park.
When he first arrived in the Southwest,
Roger worked on several large- scale survey and excavations projects conducted by several New Mexico and Colorado universities.
In 1982 Roger entered contract archaeology, working throughout the greater Southwest.
Roger has a specialty in lithic technology and analysis.
Other focus areas include prehistoric lithic material source studies, Archaic and late prehistoric Pueblo settlement patterns, northwest New Mexico Archaic projectile point type interpretation, historic documentation records for prehistoric architectural sites, early railroad engineering and building documentation studies, and early Hispanic trail studies.
Roger will be continuing the work begun by Rachel Anderson, who held the VT archaeologist position at Chaco.
He has already begun the development and updating of forms used to document architecture condition and treatments.
This information along with other site data will be entered in the ASMIS /VT database and parameters for data retrieval established.
Roger will be learning to use ASMIS and will begin entering the 1,200 + VT sites into the database.
Evaluation of the accuracy of available data and updating this information will be one of the priorities.
Roger will also provide assistance to the Chief of Cultural Resources and the Preservation Foreman with such duties as budget tracking, RMP review, day- to- day division management, archaeological oversight of preservation activities, planning projects and related activities.
To help minimize impacts to VT sites Roger will be monitoring compliance projects and completing reports relating to actions involving NHPA and NEPA concerns.
Jack Trujillo, Leo Chiquito, and Paul Tso, Masonry Workers The preservation staff worked on a variety of treatment projects ranging from architectural documentation, backfilling six remote sites in the backcountry, and routine mortar and capping repair in most of the front country structures.
They conducted condition assessments in late winter on some 50 architectural structures to develop preservation priorities for the next few years.
Also during the winter, the staff compiled backlogged preservation records, photographs, and other documentation for the museum technician to

Early in the spring, Jack, Leo, Paul, and James began pre- treatment photography and written documentation of the structures slated for work this year, and compiled architecture documentation forms for those rooms lacking these records.
Additional work completed by the VT preservation staff included treatment at several sites managed by the BLM Farmington Resource Area.
Mortar repair and capping was completed at three Gobernador Phase pueblitos on Ensenada Mesa and at Bis Sa Ani, a Chaco Greathouse several miles north of the park boundary.
This work is done as part of the 1980 Chaco Protection Sites Program legislation and is a successful partnership between the BLM, Navajo Nation, and NPS.
Training Most of the VT preservation crew participated in the VT Workshop in Tumacacori, taking special interest in the documentation and scaffolding sessions.
In March, the entire crew attended scaffolding training and successfully completed tests to be certified in using and erecting scaffolding.
This training and instruction was invaluable to the backfilling program in particular, and to the routine treatment work that is often conducted on walls that are 10 to 40 feet in height.
New equipment and scaffolding designs were added to our program.
Additionally, one of our staff attended HAZMAT training in order to assist our program and other park staff in dealing with hazardous materials we use as part of our operation.

Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot National Monuments Ruben Ramirez and Alex Contreras, Masonry Workers The Vanishing Treasures Program at Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot National Monuments continues to provide the parks with a stabilization and restoration effort that is proving consistent and progressive.
In FY 2002, the permanent staff of Alex and Ruben was augmented by a seasonal team of Lori Thwaite and Ben Keller.
Lori accepted a term position at Chiricahua N. M. at mid- season so a couple of emergency hires (Suzanne Evans and Beverly Vogelbacher) were brought in to assist the VT team.
The VT staff continues to remove the hard Portland cement mortar from Tuzigoot Ruins, salvaging all structurally sound stones and replacing the mortar with a softer soil cement mix.
Deteriorated stones are replaced with similar but more structurally sound stones gathered from the surrounding area.
The completed work continues to receive many positive comments from park visitors and staff.
For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, the crew repointed 1283 square feet of wall, replaced 412 square feet of deteriorated stone surface, repaired 309 linear feet of basal wall structure and recapped 98 linear feet of wall cap.
Fort Bowie National Historic Site Phil Tapia, Masonry Worker Phil was quite busy during FY 2002.
In the fall he completed the finishing touches on work performed in the summer.
This included some minor drainage corrections on the Post Trader's Store (HS032) and Cavalry Barracks (HS010) as well as touching up the soil wash on these buildings.
His winter months were spent documenting the work performed during the summer with photographs, drawings and written reports and preparing for the FY 2002 project.
After the seasonal crew was hired, work began on the Cavalry Barracks under Phil's supervision.
This year accumulated layers of lime plaster encapsulation were removed and fresh thin layers were reapplied on Cavalry Barracks (HS008), and Officer's Quarters (HS001, HS004 and 005).

artifacts from the 1983 "Tufa" House excavations at Mission San Juan and processing of artifacts from the 1984 Bastion excavations at Mission Espada.
Susan helped to organize the University of Texas San Antonio (UTSA) Archeological Field School which was held at Mission Concepcion in the summer of 2002.
The field school excavated in the "courtyard" east of the convento to determine what Spanish Colonial ruins were present in order to design a drainage system in that area that will remove water from the convento walls and help prevent rising damp and loss of Spanish Colonial frescos in that area.
Large scale rains after the field school revealed a void underneath the southeast corner of the Father President's Office.
This void was evaluated with the aid of the park historical architect and local structural engineer.
Emergency stabilization was necessary and the void was filled using a soil, lime, and concrete mix to best imitate the surrounding soil matrix.
Documentation projects included the Spanish Colonial wall ruins uncovered during the 2002 field school and the Portland removal repointing project at Mission ConcepciÃ³n.
Test excavations were conducted for a new parking lot at the Espada Aqueduct that will include a gate to prevent after- hours vandalism that has been a continuing problem at the aqueduct (a National Historic Landmark property).

This crew provides management of all historic structures at the site and is specifically responsible for the preservation of over 100 stone and adobe structures.
The crew is also actively involved in documentation of preservation treatments accomplished at the site as well as documentation of the ongoing condition changes of all of the park's historic structures.
Training In June of 2002, Jeffery had the opportunity to spend three days working with Cornerstones Community Partnerships on an ongoing preservation project at the Socorro Mission near El Paso Texas.
Here, Jeffery, along with the rest of the Fort Davis VT crew, discussed preservation techniques utilized at the mission and assisted with lime plastering of the exterior of the mission.
Jeffery also had the opportunity to assist the nearby community of Fort Stockton by providing consultation on adobe and plaster preservation of their historic buildings.
In addition, as part of the NPS Youth Conservation Core (YCC) program, four high school students had the opportunity to work with the Fort Davis historic preservation crew for eight weeks on adobe preservation treatments.
It is hoped that the students gained a greater understanding and appreciation for historic preservation of our deteriorating historic structures.
Linda Richards and Rogelio (Roy) CataÃ±o, Masonry Workers During FY 2002, both Linda and Roy were busy conducting preservation work on Fort Davis' historic adobe structures.
Both Linda and Roy assisted in leading a seasonal crew in preservation treatments on six adobe structures at Fort Davis.
This work included, an Officer's Quarters, two kitchens, a stable, an earth closet (privy), and a granary building.
As a result of the preservation work conducted at Fort Davis NHS, Linda, Roy, and Jeffery have developed several innovative approaches that fulfill the mandates outlined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (36 CFR Part 68).
In order to comply with these standards, the preservation crew has utilized a three- tiered approach.
First, modern replacement adobe bricks and mud mortars are mixed with predetermined color combinations of mineral pigments to ensure that replacement adobe mud is "visually compatible" with the original.
This year the preservation crew also developed a technique of cutting adobe veneers on site from full adobe bricks.
This simple idea provides the correct size of adobe veneers on demand as well as providing a rough surface which bonds better to the existing walls.
In addition, the rough surfaces of the veneers create a visual effect, which matches the original adobe materials and closely mimics the existing wall.
Second, small quantities of blue fibers are added to the modern adobe brick mixture so that the new materials can be easily differentiated from the original adobe.
This practice creates a distinct visual marker which is easy to identify upon close inspection but which is virtually invisible from more than ten feet away.
Third, all preservation treatments are carefully documented with photographs and are fully described with explanatory text.
Training Both Linda and Roy, along with Jeffery, had the opportunity to spend three days working with Cornerstones Community Partnerships on an ongoing preservation project at the Socorro Mission near El Paso Texas.
Linda and Roy also had the opportunity to assist the nearby community of Fort Stockton by providing consultation on adobe and plaster preservation of their historic buildings.

During FY 2002, Preston installed several electronic crack monitors and dataloggers at various Vanishing Treasures Parks and Monuments.
One is currently in place at Inscription House at Navajo National Monument; one is at Cutthroat Castle at Hovenweep NM, and one at Spring House at Mesa Verde NP.
These dataloggers collect temperature and crack width measurements at specific time intervals, and the data obtained so far indicates, as expected, that the crack width fluctuations correlate with temperature changes.
These monitors will be left in place for several years to see if the cracks are getting wider over time and to help determine the rate of movement, if any.
Preston also installed several Avongard brand crack monitors.
These consist of two acrylic plates with a grid scale on one plate and a cross hair on the other.
Each plate is attached to the wall on each side of a crack, usually with epoxy.
If the wall on either side of the crack moves, the plates will move also and the scale will show the direction and amount of movement.
Preston has been working with the MEVE historical architect and archeologists to evaluate the structural stability and conditions affecting the stability of Spring House.
Here he installed two Avongard crack monitors and one electronic crack monitor with datalogger on several walls within the site.
In addition, he installed seven soil moisture monitoring devices at various locations between the spring at the back of the alcove and the architecture in order to determine how much moisture is infiltrating from the spring to the wall foundations.
Preston also helped design and install a system to support a leaning wall at MEVE backcountry alcove site 5MV542.
A 2m section of exterior wall was leaning severely and was in danger of collapsing.
MEVE stabilization crews installed an angle iron support along the outside of the wall and anchored it to the back of the alcove with turnbuckles and all- thread epoxied into the sandstone.
In addition, Preston designed a small support that was installed at 5MV 1500, (Lancaster House) to support a corner of a short wall where the alcove had eroded at the base of the wall.
Preston also assessed conditions at 5MV1006 and 5MV557 (Painted Kiva) and installed Avongard crack
monitors at these sites to monitor potential wall movement at these sites.
Preston traveled to WACC in December 2002 and retrieved several reports produced by Todd Rutenbeck, who held a similar position in the early 1980's.
Mr. Fisher has made visits to Casa Grande NM and Keet Seel (Navajo NM), two of the sites where Mr. Rutenbeck had begun structural monitoring, and repaired equipment installed by Mr. Rutenbeck and re- established monitoring activities at these sites.
Also while at WACC, Preston found a copy of a 1961 MEVE report by then Park Archeologist Al Lancaster entitled "System of Controls along Selected Cracks in Cliff Dwellings 1961".
During 2002, Preston made visits to each of these sites and made follow- up measurements at each control point and is currently finalizing a follow- up report detailing his findings at each site.
Preston conducted a structural assessment of Square Tower House at Mesa Verde National Park, established baseline monitoring and evaluation criteria, and prepared a report of his findings and recommendations.
He provided structural engineering evaluation and support to the MEVE Long Mesa Fire BAER team following the Long Mesa Fire at Mesa Verde NP in August.
Technical Assistance To Other Parks/Training In FY 2002, Preston provided assistance to Aztec Ruins National Monument (NM), Casa Grande NM, Gila Cliff Dwellings NM, Grand Canyon National Park (NP), Hovenweep NM, Mesa Verde NP, Navajo NM, Organ Pipe Cactus NM, Tonto NM, Tubac State Park (Arizona), Tumacacori National Historic Park, and Wupatki NM.
He assisted in planning and conducting a training program for Hopi Foundation crafts people.
He served on the Vanishing Treasures SEPAS Panel in February.
Preston presented a paper entitled, When will the Walls Come Tumbling Down? An Engineer's Perspective to evaluating stability of Ancestral Puebloan structures at Mesa Verde National Park, at the 67th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, March 24, 2002 in Denver, CO.

Tumacacori National Historical Park Houston Rogers, Archeologist Sadly, this year Houston was involved in a fatal traffic accident that resulted in his death.
Prior to this tragic event, Houston had continued to contribute to the progress of the VT Initiative.
In FY 2002, Houston continued documentation of the stabilization efforts on the mission dome, sacristy, and convento.
Most of Houston's year was spent digitizing archeological and architectural base maps, production of orthographic photos, scanning of historic photographs and slides, and development of a preservation database.
Using digital image analysis and measurement software, Houston had begun to reconstruct the preservation history of the mission's structures from historic photographs.
He was in the testing stages of a database that will provide preservation staff a high degree of recording accuracy and accountability while remaining "user- friendly".
Houston's plan for this information was for its use in developing a more comprehensive and integrated preservation and condition assessment program for future projects.
Training In October 2001, Houston helped to organize the Vanishing Treasures Conference held at Rio Rico Resort, hosted by Tumacacori NHP.
In May, Houston attended a preservation workshop held at Acoma Pueblo, New Mexico, and assisted VT staff as an instructor at the Ruins Preservation Workshop at Ft. Apache, Arizona.
San Antonio Missions National Historical Park Dean Ferguson, Masonry Worker In FY 2002, Dean performed masonry stabilization and preservation work on the Corridor and Convento located at Mission ConcepciÃ³n.
This preservation work consisted of mitigating damage associated with decades old Portland cement used to repoint historic fabric.
He meticulously removed Portland cement from these areas and replaced it with a softer more historically appropriate mortar.
Dean photo- documented the various stages of this preservation project and routinely photo- documents all projects he is involved with.
Also at Mission ConcepciÃ³n, Dean worked in conjunction with University of Texas San Antonio and park archeologists to stabilize subsurface ruins uncovered during an extensive excavation of the "courtyard" east of the convento.
This work included filling the void beneath the Father President's Office caused by extensive summer rains.
Dean teamed with park masonry worker, Steven Siggins to patch, repoint, and reline the 1500 square feet of interior channel of the historic Espada Aqueduct, a National Historic Landmark.
This work also included vegetation removal and lowpressure hot water cleaning of the external part of this structure.
Dean's ongoing work also includes regular low- pressure cleaning of graffiti as needed from several of the parks historic buildings including the Espada Aqueduct and Structure 413 at Mission Espada.

Training In October 2001, Brian attended the Vanishing Treasures Conference held at Rico Rico Resort and hosted by Tumacacori NHP.
Aztec Ruins National Monument Brian Culpepper, Archeologist Brian continues to direct the preservation program at Aztec Ruins.
The majority of his time was spent coordinating the West Ruin architectural documentation and backfill projects.
Under the direction of Brian, seasonal archeologists Gary Brown and Beth Chambers completed documentation of fifteen room spaces and two kivas.
The entire East Wing and half of the North Wing has now been documented through both photographic and written formats.
The wood documentation project, part of the architectural documentation program and conducted by Tom Windes, removed cores for tree- ring analysis and is nearing completion of sampling efforts.
Brian coordinated all treatment activities for the park including identification of areas needing treatment, organization of treatment photography, and entry of a daily work logs into the database.
Brian also helped to organize the photographic documentation of the on- going backfilling project.
Brian also established several monitoring programs by placing Environmental dataloggers in six rooms with intact prehistoric roofs to monitor temperature and relative humidity.
In the future, the data may help to determine the desired conditions to preserve wooden structural elements.
Several samples of modern wood (aspen and cottonwood) were buried in backfilled rooms.
Once re- exposed and examined, the information may help to determine the effect of backfilling on wood.
Crack monitors were installed in several locations and a program of mortar sampling continued.
Additionally, Brian authored the FY01 stabilization and backfill reports, and two successful SEPAS proposals to continue the

Training In August 2002, Larry attended a three- day workshop held at Bandelier National Monument.
He trained with the crew making assessments, repointing, and resetting the walls of Tyuonyi Pueblo.
Use Of Lapse Salary Lapsed salary was used to purchase supplies, materials and equipment to support the park's preservation program, remodel office space to accommodate the position and to pay for employee relocation cost.
Personnel cost to hire a seasonal worker to assist with stabilization work was also paid from this account.
Training In October 2001, James participated in the Vanishing Treasures Conference hosted by Tumacacori NHP, taking special interest in the documentation and scaffolding sessions.
In March, the entire crew attended scaffolding training and successfully completed tests to be certified in using and erecting scaffolding.
This training and instruction was invaluable to the backfilling program in particular, and to the routine treatment work that is often conducted on walls that are 10 to 40 feet in height.
As a result, new equipment and scaffolding designs were added to our program, which will greatly improve the preservation crews' ability to conduct their stabilization activities.
Chaco Culture National Historical Park James Yazzie, Masonry Worker During FY 2002, James, along with the rest of the preservation crew, worked on a variety of treatment projects ranging from documenting and backfilling six remote sites in the backcountry, to routine mortar and capping repair in most of the front country structures.
James assisted in conducting condition assessments on 50 architectural structures to develop preservation priorities for the next few years.
In addition, James also assisted in compiling backlogged preservation records, photographs, and other documentation for the museum technician to assemble into yearly reports.
Early in the spring, Jack, Leo Paul and James began pre- treatment photography and written documentation of the structures slated for work this year, and compiled architecture documentation forms for those rooms lacking these records.
Additional work James assisted in included treatment at several sites managed by the BLM Farmington Resource Area, repairing mortar and caps at three Gobernador Phase pueblitos on Ensenada Mesa and at Bis Sa Ani, a Chaco Greathouse several miles north of the park boundary.
This work was done as part of the 1980 Chaco Protection Sites Program legislation which is a successful partnership between the BLM, Navajo Nation, and NPS.
El Morro National Monument Debra Popham, Archeological Technician Debra continues to serve as part of El Morro's preservation crew, as well as assisting VT hires Jim Kendrict and Calvin Chimoni at El Malpais NM and Petrified Forest NP.

prepared a position description and a vacancy announcement was set to be advertised in early February with the hope that the position would be filled by early April.
Once in place this individual would be responsible for redesigning the Architectural Documentation and Assessment Program, developing an effective monitoring strategy for all VT resources, and re- establishing ruins preservation efforts.
Regrettably, the conjunction of new housing construction through the Trailer Replacement Program, along with the discovery of severe asbestos contamination in all remaining park housing units, forced an immediate relocation of three families and a delay on all hiring actions within the park.
Although we had anticipated being in new housing by May, numerous construction delays pushed the completion date to sometime in late summer.
Quite simply, these events resulted in no housing being available until mid August.
To clarify, Canyon de Chelly National Monument is located in the middle of the Navajo Reservation with nearest towns roughly 90 miles to the south.
What this means is that any employees of Canyon de Chelly National Monument that are not registered members of the local Navajo chapters must obtain housing within the park or make very long commutes.
Clearly, these realities Â­ and the events described above - limited our ability to adequately advertise for the VT Archeologist in FY 2002. Use of Lapse Funding The monument re- designed the $58,000 to, 1) carry out modest monitoring efforts; 2) develop a framework for consulting with canyon residents prior to architectural documentation and preservation activities; 3) re- establish the field and laboratory infrastructure to support the VT Program; and 4) augment funding for the White House Ruin Documentation and Assessment Project in order to prepare an accurate photogrammetric map of both the ruin and adjacent stream course.
While these efforts hardly represent what we thought we would accomplish this year, they have laid the foundation for the establishment of a comprehensive Vanishing Treasures Program in FY 2003.
Fort Union National Monument Due to position description discrepancies in FY2002, Fort Union was unable to hire the VT funded position.
Therefore we are now in the process of recruiting for an Exhibit Specialist/Work Leader position.
We hope to have this position filled by early 2003. Use of Lapse Funding A portion of the lapse funding for fiscal year 02' was used to provide an opportunity for existing preservation staff to fill a temporary work leader position and to hire seasonal staff to address major deficiencies within the Fort ruins.
Seasonal hires included one WG- 5 masonry worker and five WG- 3 laborers.
Stabilization work that was accomplished by the preservation staff during FY 02 included applying two layers of adobe mud shelter coats on approximately 45,000 square feet of exposed adobe surface, for a total of 90,000 square feet of applied material.
The preservation team made and installed 1,800 adobe bricks in making repairs on lintels and windowsills, and addressed several areas of basal coving, on several structures and performed vegetation control throughout the ruins.
The Capping crew completed the capping project begun in 1998, that included making and installing over 2,000 amended adobe bricks, and capped 650 lineal feet of uncapped walls, and also applied an additional 10,000 square feet of shelter coating throughout the Third Fort.
The Foundation repair crew repointed and reset approximately 2,600 lineal feet of foundations with an average thickness of 28 inches throughout the Third Fort area.

Brantley holds a Master of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Arts Degree, both in Anthropology, from Washington State University, and brings with him over 40 years experience working in archeology and cultural resource management.
Brantley is an expert in many areas including, site assessment, field archeology, and management planning, and has written numerous cultural resource reports and planning documents.
During FY 2003 Brantley will focus much of his efforts on developing Glenn Canyon's preservation plan.
Use of Lapse Salary Lapse salary from the VT position was used to hire seasonal Archeological Technician, Marc Pfahning, who carried out much of the VT work prior to Brantley's arrival.
Marc spent much of his time conducting condition assessments of VT resources in remote areas of the park, including Explorer Canyon in the Escalante region; Cove and Clearwater Canyons near Hite; and the Orange Cliffs area.
Other duties accomplished by Marc included updating databases, and archiving negatives, photographs, and slides.
Marc also assisted the Western Archeological Conservation Center (WACC) by compiling documentation forms that were scanned by WACC staff, and entered into an Arcview GIS database system.
Marc also assisted Navajo National Monument staff with site condition assessments at Keet Seel.
In addition to hiring Marc, $20,000 in lapse funds were used to purchase computers, office furniture, and office supplies essential to carrying out VT activities.
The remaining funds went towards field transportation including a GSA vehicle, boat fuel, and aircraft rental.
Training Marc completed the DOIMOCC boating course, a necessity for work at Glenn Canyon, and was red carded after completing wildland firefighting training.
Glen Canyon National Recreation Area Brantley Jackson, Archeologist Brantley Jackson was selected to fill the Vanishing Treasures Archeologist position, and began his service at Glenn Canyon in October 2002.
Although the Vanishing Treasures Program funded the position at a GS- 9 level, Glenn Canyon staff determined that a highly skilled professional, who possessed the required education and experience, was necessary in order to carry out Vanishing Treasures work.
Therefore, the park chose to augment Vanishing Treasures funding and fill the position as a GS- 11 TERM.

Bandelier National Monument Preserve Frijoles Canyon Cavate Pueblos $50,000 In FY 2002, the Vanishing Treasures Program at Bandelier National Monument began Phase II of the Frijoles Canyon Cavate Pueblo Conservation Project, a three- phase collaborative project between the National Park Service, the University of Pennsylvania and the Museum of New Mexico.
The conservation project focused on cavates, which are hand- enlarged, earthen- plastered storage and habitation room carved into the soft volcanic Bandelier Tuff cliffs of the Jemez Mountains in New Mexico.
The cavates were built and used from the 1200- 1500s and are the ancestral homes to the Tewa and Keres- speaking people who still reside in the area.
There are approximately 1008 cavates concentrated on the north side of Frijoles Canyon, along a mile and a half stretch where the canyon widens before descending to the Rio Grande.
The objectives of the Frijoles Canyon Cavate Pueblo Conservation Project are to develop appropriate methods to identify, document, conserve, and maintain the cavates as both constructed and natural heritage; to prepare a formal Conservation Plan for their long- term protection; and to provide education and practical training in site conservation and management for Native American and graduate students.
Specific goals of Phase II are to complete baseline architectural documentation and systematic condition and significance assessment of 1000+ Frijoles Canyon cavates; to investigate and monitor environmental causes of their deterioration; to test methods of documentation through Geographic Information Systems (GIS); to generate a Priority Treatment Schedule for future treatment; to develop and test treatment methods; and to continue the Field School in Site Conservation and

Heritage Management for Puebloan students and graduate interns.
In its fifth year, the field school brought together undergraduate and graduate students in archaeology, historic preservation, conservation interns, and Native American students from the Northern Rio Grande Pueblos of Cochiti, San Ildefonso, San Juan and Santo Domingo, and a professional staff from the National Park Service and the Museum of New Mexico for practical conservation training and fieldwork.
This year, formal training was provided in stone masonry stabilization, photography, architectural documentation, condition assessment and graffiti mitigation.
A stabilization project was also performed on Tyuonyi Pueblo, a 14th century masonry pueblo in Frijoles Canyon.
This site is a highly visited frontcountry site that contains 240 exposed ground floor rooms.
The rooms have been periodically stabilized since they were excavated by Edgar Lee Hewett in 1908.
Training of the masonry stabilization crew was conducted by Rene Laya, a professional mason affiliated with the Intermountain Support Office in Santa Fe (IMSO- SF).
Student interns from local universities and Native American Pueblos were led by Ron Winters, also from IMSO- SF.
By the end of the season, 133 wall faces had been stabilized by repointing and/or resetting stones.
In addition, a VT Stabilization Workshop was hosted at Bandelier, and participants from seven park units and from the White Mountain Apache tribe worked with the seasonal crew to stabilize walls in Tyuonyi Pueblo.

The blocks were formed and dried near the Dorgan House while preparation work on the structure was completed.
Fort Davis National Historic Site was called on for assistance in getting started with adobe block production and for ideas concerning window and door treatments.
Fort Davis sent down two preservation specialists for a day to work with our crew on get our crew started with adobe block construction.
The assistance from Fort Davis was great, and special thanks to Fort Davis for their assistance.
As adobe blocks were being made, construction of an adobe wall continued until the entire wall was completed.
Construction also included placement of door and window lintels as well as placing a mud cap atop the last row of adobe block.
A scratch coat of plaster was also applied to the outside of the adobe block to protect it from weathering.
The project fulfilled stabilization needs of the Dorgan House, preserving the integrity of the remaining structure.
Canyonlands National Park Salt Creek Condition Assessment - $56,400 In August of 2000, a lightning- caused fire burned approximately 87 acres along the Salt Creek Canyon drainage within Canyonlands National Park.
The loss of vegetative cover exposed a large, multi- story, multi- room habitation site (42SA25067).
Previously protected from view, this site was now completely visible to anyone walking along the trail, 400 meters away.
The park requested and received funding from the Vanishing Treasures program to conduct baseline condition assessment documentation in anticipation of increased visitor impacts.
During an 8- day field session in July, 2002, a site documentation team from Mesa Verde National Park, under the direction of Don Corbeil, performed Level 1 documentation.

This information will be invaluable, both as a baseline site documentation tool, as well as a means of tracking future natural and visitorcaused impacts.
Chaco Culture National Historic Park Implement Backfill Program at 6 excavated Backcountry Structures - $125,000 The preservation staff worked on a variety of treatment projects ranging from documenting and backfilling six remote sites in the backcountry to routine mortar and capping repair in most of the front country structures.
Six sites excavated between the early 1900s and the 1960s were slated for backfilling in this first phase of work on excavated backcountry sites in the park.
Five of the six sites are clustered in the central core of the park and are in extremely poor condition.
Some were excavated as part of the `field school' era of research in the park, and some were excavated as `emergency' operations during the salvage era.
Several of the sites were backfilled to grade with no remaining masonry exposed.
Others were filled to original soil levels prior to excavation and still have small sections of standing masonry.
Because no drainage features were needed in these sites, a locally available sandy silt fill material was used.
The complicated logistics and access to some of these structures required the program to purchase several additional sections of conveyors, new scaffolding frames and boards, and several motorized toters.
Prior to being backfilled, all structures were recorded through mapping, black 
Two of the backfilled structures, known as Zorro Bradley Site and the Voll Site, are located on the extreme southern edge of Chaco Wash.
In the early 1960s, these sites were thought to be threatened by active erosion and arroyo bank collapse.
They were completely excavated as
salvage operations, and brief excavation reports with maps were filed shortly after the excavations.
In the subsequent 40+ years, no further bank erosion has occurred, in part due to favorable climatic and arroyo deposition patterns.
But having been left open and exposed, deterioration of wall surfaces, foundations, and other architectural features was extensive.
It was determined that the remaining fabric could only be preserved by backfilling the site to the preexcavation levels.
Logistically, these two sites were extremely difficult to access and massive scaffolding bridges across Chaco Wash were constructed to convey soil up into the sites.
This work could not have been safely attempted without the scaffold training/certification.
The third site designated for backfilling is a 10- 15 room structure that was excavated sometime in the 1930s or 1940s, and no known notes maps or other excavation records exist.
It is located at the base of West Mesa, along the long- abandoned Wetherill Coal Mine road.
This road was used to transport fill material to the site, then rehabbed once the work was completed.
The final three structures backfilled this year are located in the South Gap region of the park.
Casa Sombreada is a cliff structure located high on the talus and was backfilled by carrying buckets of fill up to the roomblocks.
Anna Sheppard's Site is an extensive masonry structure with at least three articulated roomblocks.
Only a small portion of the site was excavated in the 1930s, and this portion was also filled by hand carrying fill up into the exposed rooms.
This site may have either been vandalized and/or excavated by an early museum expedition, perhaps in the early 1900s.
It is located along the historic south road between Thoreau and Chaco Canyon, so access for the purposes of backfilling was relatively easy.
Additional work completed by the VT preservation staff included treatment at several sites managed by the BLM Farmington Resource Area and at three Gobernador Phase pueblitos on Ensenada Mesa, Bis Sa Ani, and at a Chaco Greathouse several miles north of the park boundary.
This work was done as part of the 1980 Chaco Protection Sites Program legislation and is a successful partnership between the BLM, Navajo Nation, and NPS.

Hovenweep/Natural Bridges National Monuments Document and Treat Cutthroat and Hackberry Architecture - $24,000 The park requested and received $24,000 in funding from the Vanishing Treasures program to continue Level 1 site documentation and condition assessment work at the Cajon and Cutthroat Units at Hovenweep National Monument.
Two crews from Mesa Verde performed the work, which took place at Cutthroat in early August under the direction of Joel Brisbain, and at Cajon in early September under the direction of Julie Bell.
Level 1 documentation was completed on approximately half of the structures at Cajon and was 80- 90% complete at Cutthroat.
Stabilization work was begun at Cutthroat in mid- September under the direction of Noreen Fritz.
Portions of Cutthroat Castle, three small walls, and a tower on the west end of this site were completed.
The stabilization work was funded through lapse money associated with new VT hires.
Approximately $20,000 of the lapse money was spent on stabilization work at the Cutthroat Unit of Hovenweep National Monument.
A crew from Mesa Verde, under the direction of Noreen Frtiz, performed stabilization on one of the structures at the unit during an 8- day field session in September.
El Malpais National Monument Stabilize and Reduce Erosion within Archeological Sites - $7,000 This is a pilot project initiated as a result of rapid and extensive soil erosion in the Sandstone Bluffs area of the monument.
This area was the home to a Puebloan community over 800 years ago and contains many of the most prominent archeological sites in El Malpais, including Las Ventanas (Candelaria Pueblo).
The development and growth of arroyos throughout this area is the primary threat to the long- term stability of a variety of archaeological sites and architectural features.
This project will reduce the pace and scale of arroyo development through extensive revegetation, construction of check dams, and the use of Excelsior chipped aspen sediment logs.
A total of $7000 was received through the Vanishing Treasures funding source to implement the project.
All of the funds were spent on Excelsior sediment logs and native grass seed.
Vanishing Treasures staff at El Malpais National Monument provided the labor to map arroyos and document threatened architecture, distribute seed, and install the sediment logs and check dams.
Due to the programs other projects, all of the erosion control features could not be implemented at all three sites this year.
However, the project will be completed by spring of 2003.
El Malpais and El Morro National Monuments The Vanishing Treasures Program at El Malpais and El Morro National Monuments had a very active and successful year.
Activities included preservation projects in each of the parks, organizing a seminar on backfilling sites as preservation treatment and developing interpretive products related to the parks VT programs and projects.
Vanishing Treasures staff also received valuable training on a variety of subjects, including fire effects on cultural resources and compliance.
The program conducted several projects during Fiscal Year 2002, two of which were funded through the SEPAS process.
El Morro National Monument Study Animal Impacts on Archeological Sites $8,900 The park's Vanishing Treasures program is working with Northern Arizona University through the Cooperative Extension Study Unit (CESU) in order to identify the various species affecting archeological resources at El Morro National Monument.
Park management, Vanishing Treasures staff and Intermountain Region Support Office archeologists have identified extensive ground disturbance by burrowing animals within numerous archeological sites.
Ground disturbance is often extensive enough to expose and threaten architecture.

Working with professional biologists from Northern Arizona University, the project will first focus on identifying species affecting the sites.
All of the funds for this project (a total of $8900) will cover the expenses of the biologists and the subsequent technical report of their findings.
In conjunction with this first phase of work, Vanishing Treasures staff will document architectural features and map other portions of sites impacted over recent years.
The second phase of the project will be to determine immediate and long- term treatment options for protecting sites from this activity at El Morro.
Finally, phase three will implement those treatment options.
Projects were also conducted at the largest or most visited Vanishing Treasures resources within three parks.
These resources include Puerco Ruin at Petrified Forest National Park, Atsinna Pueblo at El Morro National Monument, and Las Ventanas (Candelaria Pueblo) at El Malpais National Monument.
Other Projects Garrett Homestead, El Malpais National Monument During the months of June and July, the program conducted preservation activities at the Garrett Homestead, a Dust Bowl era residential structure in the Sandstone Bluffs area of El Malpais National Monument.
Vanishing Treasures staff repointed mortar joints on all standing walls and wall caps with natural, non- amended mortar.
To reduce root damage to walls, vegetation along the base of the interior and exterior walls was manually removed during the work season.
This project was successful in upgrading the Garrett Homestead to "good" condition, and the resource should now only need routine annual maintenance to sustain that condition.
Atsinna Preservation Project, El Morro National Monument The multi- year preservation project initiated during the summer of 2000 continued during August and September of 2002.
Extensive preservation treatments were completed on three walls at Atsinna.
Cement and other modified mortars were found to be causing large voids in these walls.
Initial treatments, therefore, included
the removal of all cement and modified mortar material from the wall faces.
Routine maintenance, such as removing vegetation along the base of walls and removing debris and silt from the drainage system (renovated during the summer of 2000) was conducted before and after the project.
In addition, pre- and post- architectural photodocumentation was completed with digital and manual 35 mm cameras.
Public Education Projects, Tres Piedras Group Several endeavors at increasing visitor understanding of the Vanishing Treasures Program and the significance of these resources were initiated during FY 2002.
With the assistance of Interpretive divisions at El Malpais National Monument and Petrified Forest National Park, rack cards for the preservation projects at the Garrett Homestead and Puerco Ruin were developed.
On the front cover of each is a brief narrative of the resource and project.
On the back cover of each rack card is a brief description of the Vanishing Treasures Program and the tri- park program at El Malpais, El Morro, and Petrified Forest.
Assistance was also provided during the fiscal year to the Visitor Services division at El Malpais regarding brochures related to Vanishing Treasures resources, such as the Zuni- Acoma Trail.
Management and Vanishing Treasures staff at the three parks agreed that a name was needed for the tri- park cooperative effort.
We all agreed that a name would assist interpretive efforts, and chose Tres Piedras as our group name.
Tres Piedras refers to the three distinctive types of rocks found at the three parks: the extensive basalt at El Malpais, the distinctive sandstone of El Morro, and the world- famous petrified wood of Petrified Forest National Park.

Preservation projects at Walnut Canyon included a pilot scanning / mapping project on a ranger ledge site and ongoing wall mapping and architectural documentation of the Ranger Ledge sites.
Stabilization treatment at the three aforementioned Wupatki sites consisted of repointing eroded mortar joints, resetting loose or dislodged capstones, removing vegetation, cleaning and correcting drainages, and sealing rodent burrowed holes.
As for documentation of the Ranger Ledge Sites at Walnut Canyon, GeoMap Inc., a survey firm from Tucson, Arizona, via a cooperative agreement between the NPS and Northern Arizona University, was contracted to scan map the northern periphery of the canyon along the Ranger Ledge area, as well as one site as a pilot project.

Fort Bowie National Historic Site Primary Resource Preservation, Phase II $48,400 Fort Bowie's adobe walls have been treated by encapsulation with lime plaster since 1988.
Although the lime plaster shelter coat is breathable and waterproof, the layers have accumulated to the point of being too thick in many areas.
As plaster thickness approaches 4 inches, it no longer adheres to the adobe walls and falls off in square yard sections.
The current Historic Structures Preservation Guide calls for removal of the failing lime plaster encapsulation and re- coating the exposed adobe walls with fresh material.
This year's project included the Cavalry Barracks (HS008), Kitchen (HS009) and Officer's Quarters (HS001, HS004 and HS005).
The Cavalry Barracks is one of the largest ruins at the fort.

permanent VT staff members Phil Tapia, Fernie Nunez, and seasonal employees Phil Tapia Jr., Bandy Smart, Ralph Hale, Israel Tapia and Jon Ramil After the failing plaster coat was removed from all structures, except the kitchen, a layer of unamended mud was applied over the original adobe to fill in uneven areas and provide a smoother surface on which to spread the plaster.
Unamended lime plaster was applied in two thin layers consisting of a scratch coat and a finish coat.
A lime whitewash was applied over the final plaster coat as an additional breathable sealer that bonds with the plaster.
This was followed by a soil wash, used to tint the surface color to an earthen tone.
The Kitchen, which now has a stone foundation, received different treatment.
The mortar joints were cleaned by removing all failing mortar and then repointed.
The work was carefully documented through photographs, drawings, and writing by Phil Tapia.
Visitor curiosity provided the whole crew with ample opportunities to interpret ruins preservation techniques.
E- 330 (an acrylic polymer) was added to the modern adobe brick and mud mixture.
The preservation treatments on the six buildings are anticipated to protect the structures from weather erosion for 7 to 10 years.
Fort Laramie National Historic Site Complete Lime Grout/Lime Plaster Research Program - $11,000 Project work for FY02 at Fort Laramie NHS was focused on Phase II of the Lime Concrete and Plaster Preservation Project.
Two comprehensive reports completed this year were derived from data generated from on- site fieldwork conducted in 2001.
Helen Thomas, a graduate student from Columbia University, wrote her Master's Thesis titled Lime Mortar Models, Curing and Conservation.
Helen's thesis was conceived as a means of finding ways to retard the effects of the erosion and freeze- thaw damage to historic lime concrete.
Chemical consolidation was chosen as the amendment option for historic lime concrete--lime water, ammonium oxalate and Hydroxylating Conversion Treatment (HCT)--to help strengthen the lime concrete.
Analysis and tests were performed in a laboratory environment as a component of Helen's thesis: Gravimetric Analysis on lime concrete was conducted to determine baseline concrete composition data.
Indirect Tensile Strength Test, Micro- Abrasion, and Freeze Thaw tests were performed on samples after they had been individually treated with one of the three consolidants (water was used on a fourth sample for control).
Lab tests yielded favorable results with the ammonium oxalate and limewater, the HTC and water, however produced no quantifiable consolidating effects.
Helen's work was supported by input from Norman Weiss and Pamela Jerome, Associate Professors, Columbia University Ms. Thomas's thesis, past treatments, and recommendations from Cultural Resource Specialists (CRS) from the National Park Service and Colorado State University (CSU) Architectural Preservation Institute (API) and Anne Oliver's Phase I

Fort Davis National Historic Site Cap and Mud Adobe Walls on Four Historic Structures - $39,100 Fort Davis NHS utilized 2002 Vanishing Treasures funds to hire two seasonal workers and purchase supplies and materials needed to complete preservation treatment on seven adobe structures at Fort Davis.
The two seasonal workers and the park's two permanent VT employees used adobe caps and veneers to protect heavily eroded adobe walls on six adobe structures.
Protected structures include an Officer's Quarters, two kitchens, a stable, an earth closet (privy), and a granary building.
The project first required the removal of inappropriate previous treatments such as soil cement caps and veneers.
Once the original adobe materials were exposed and inspected, structurally weak areas were stabilized with adobe bricks or adobe patches.
Heavily eroded areas or exposed adobe surfaces were then capped with adobe bricks or veneers.

Oliver's report is a graphic and written record of data that four ICOMOS students, Helen Thomas, 
Additionally this report provides a myriad of treatment options for both lime concrete and plasters, and synthesizes historical treatment data i.e. cosmetic and structural interventions.
The format and volume of data illustrated by Ms. Oliver gives FOLA a powerful tool and model that can guide current and future preservation efforts, in such areas as documentation standards regarding historic lime concrete and plasters.
Architectural documentation (including photodocumentation) was completed at ten sites with subsequent preservation treatment at five sites.
Sites consist of single- story masonry structures containing one to six rooms.
Nine sites are prehistoric Ancestral Puebloan (Kayenta branch) sites and two (Beamer's Cabin and Boucher's Camp) are historic sites related to mining and early tourism in the Grand Canyon.
Of the eleven sites, ten had received previous preservation treatment.
The nature and degree of necessary preservation treatment varied between the sites.
For example, Bright Angel Pueblo and Beamer's Cabin suffered from severe impacts and were in imminent need of treatment while other sites required no fabric intervention.
However, because of the logistical costs in reaching the sites, it was most efficient to document and treat as many sites as possible.
The completion of architectural documentation as a form of treatment was a major focus of the project.
While a number of the sites are in stable condition, their remote location and heavy visitation makes them vulnerable to rapid and severe impacts.
With the completion of this project, the park now has good baseline data for eleven of its fourteen previously treated sites and for most of the heavily- visited sites along the Colorado River corridor.
Work was completed during three rafting trips down the Colorado River, each ranging from 16 to 21 days, a mule- supported weeklong backcountry trip to Phantom Ranch, and a weeklong camping trip to the North Rim.
All trips were funded by this project with the exception of a single Cooperative Resource River Trip supported by commercial outfitters.
The project relied heavily on the assistance of specialists from other parks, including the VT structural engineer from Mesa Verde, archeologists and masons from Flagstaff Area National Monuments and Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, and historical architects from the IMR Support Office and Grand Canyon.
In addition to detailed architectural documentation, the project also included contracted total station maps of three sites.
Data processing and report preparation were included

Long- term monitoring points were established on walls at two of the sites with the greatest potential for future movement.
Mesa Verde National Park Document and Treat Spring House - $125,000 As part of the Vanishing Treasures program at Mesa Verde National Park, a systematic architectural documentation and condition assessment project continued at Spring House under the direction of Dave Skoglund.
A large cliff dwelling located along the eastern edge of Long Canyon, Spring House was selected for work both for its well preserved architecture, and the threatened features near the active spring.
The site consists of at least 70 rooms and at least 6 kivas.
It is divided into two major areas of construction: a Lower Alcove area and an Upper Ledge area.
The Upper Ledge contains 24 rooms and 6 open areas.
A large portion, or central area of this ledge, contains a block of spectacular 2- story rooms with intact roofs in pristine condition.
The Lower Alcove is divided into the Northern and Southern plazas, each of which was once surrounded by rooms.
Although most of the structures in the Southern Plaza area have collapsed, there is enough rubble and remaining standing architecture to demonstrate that there were once several multi- story units in this area.
The Northern Plaza rooms are better preserved, with numerous intact walls, including a 3- story tower.
A spring located adjacent to this tower gave the site its name, but has been eroding the basal coursing of several structural features in this area.
Many of the walls near the spring area have separated and now have large cracks.
There have been several episodes of stabilization work done at Spring House, most noticeably to structures around the spring area, but deterioration is continuing since the spring is still viable.
Work had been done during 2001 at Spring House using Save America's Treasures grant funding.
The work consisted of the following.
(1) structural evaluation of the area around the spring, (2) unit inventory to match units visible on the ground with
previously compiled field records, (3) completion of site- wide information logs, (4) photography of all units in the lower alcove, (5) preparation of plan maps and elevation graphics for some of the units around the spring area, and (6) completion of the architectural documentation package for each unit mapped.
A total of 8 rooms, 2 kivas, and 3 complex open areas had been completed prior to 2002.
This project continued to work on the buildings around the spring.
Most of the time spent this summer was used in recording the three- story tower located just to the west of the spring and surrounding rooms.
Since this tower is almost 8 meters in height, the construction of a custom wooden platform surmounted by standard steel scaffolding sections was necessary to reach external areas.
Since the inside of the tower was too small to accommodate standard steel scaffolding sections, custom wooden scaffolding was built inside of the tower to document the upper two inside rooms.
Prior to building the scaffolding and platform, adjacent rooms at the base of the tower, as well as the inside lower room of the tower were documented.
These were completed during the earlier part of the field season.
As is seen with many of the rooms and the tower near the spring, there are several factors that make the high walls fairly unstable.
Due to the disintegration of the lower coursing of the walls from water erosion and the settling effects, there are numerous vertical cracks in many of the walls.
A gap at the top of the tower along the south wall shows that the tower has settled between 25 and 30 cm from its original construction and the top had subsided to the west.
This tower is probably still moving, since there is a separation at the abutment between the alcove and a portion of the west wall that was stabilized by Lancaster in 1935.
In addition to the tower and the rooms directly associated with it, numerous other rooms and open areas in the Lower Alcove were completed.
In addition, all photo- documentation for standing architecture throughout the site, including the remainder of the Lower Alcove as well as the Upper Alcove/Ledge, was completed.

Navajo National Monument Conduct Condition Assessment at Snake House, Owl House, Kiva Cave, and Turkey Cave $72,500.
Due to the vacating of one VT position, it was decided to contract out the documentation portion of the Condition Assessment Project for Turkey Cave, Snake House, Owl House, and Kiva Cave.
C Dimensions, a cultural resource management contractor specializing in three dimensional photogrammetric data recording from Plano, Texas, was awarded the contract for $68,900.
They took medium and large format stereo pairs of photographs of the architectural features of all sites from both plan- view and elevations, from which they developed three- dimensional AutoCAD drawings of all wall segments noting condition and provenienced elements.
The original high quality photographs also provided an archival baseline for future work.
Melissa Memory conducted the actual condition assessment for each wall using the Mesa Verde condition assessment form package.
The remaining project funds were used to buy a color laser printer and additional cartridges for the Monument after the departure of VT staff.
WACC continued their archives integration project for cultural resource primary documents, cataloging photographs and documents, and scanning archives onto indexed CD's.
This project will enable stabilization and site documentation to be easily accessed by VT staff without impacting primary documents.
$21,999 of lapsed VT salary was used to augment this agreement with WACC and the University of Arizona.
Lapse salary funds were also used to support a field session of an ongoing architectural documentation project at Inscription House with other VT cultural resource personnel from Mesa Verde and Flagstaff
Areas, under the direction of Larry Nordby (Mesa Verde), and field supervision of Julie Bell (Mesa Verde) and Al Remley (Flagstaff Area National Monument).
With a large crew of 18, this session furthered completion of the documentation project that has been ongoing since 1999.
Topographic and site mapping was also completed during this project, as well as establishing permanent mapping stations.
$17,900 was used for this project.
Throughout the year, Preston Fisher, VT Structural Engineer worked with Melissa and Kevin to establish a crack monitoring project at Inscription House, revived a monitoring project at Keet Seel, conducted cyclic stabilization maintenance on structures at Betatakin, and assessed structural integrity at Turkey Cave and Snake House ruins.
Pecos National Historical Park Stabilize and Preserve Ruins - $40,000 Pecos National Historical Park received $40,000 in project funding for fiscal year 2002.
The park used this money to stabilize primary structures in the main ruins complex (and includes a significant documentation component) and to record baseline condition information on architectural features at archeological sites in the back country.
Our goals were to provide hands- on preservation treatment to an estimated 500 sq. ft. of walls and to collect condition information at 21 archeological sites previously identified as having architectural features experiencing accelerated deterioration.
To accomplish our goals, we hired four seasonal workers: three masonry workers and one archeology technician.
The park's permanent, base- funded preservation staff supervised and guided the temporary staff.
The work we accomplished with the assistance of this funding enabled us to appreciably extend the lifetime of important cultural resources in the park.
The emphasis of the stabilization work was on the adobe walls of the 18th century Spanish Mission.
Approximately 1,520 sq. ft. of adobe wall encasements were replaced and several other less dramatic treatments, such as filling wall voids and pointing masonry joints, were accomplished.

encasements surround and protect the original adobe walls that are so vulnerable to weathering.
In addition, about 70 sq. ft. of stone walls in North and South Pueblos were repaired by resetting dislodged masonry.
The archeology technicians drew measured profiles and recorded other information of all of the exposed original walls.
A substantial emergency repair project in Kiva 23, located in the convento portion of the Spanish Mission, was also successfully completed.
From May through mid- July of this year, staff observed an increase in cottontail rabbit and squirrel activity in and around the main ruins complex.
After a brief but torrent monsoon period in July, nearly 100% of the back wall of the adobe ventilator shaft in Kiva 23 collapsed and washed into the kiva.
The collapse and subsequent excavations exposed the previously unseen damage as an extensive network of abandoned gopher holes taken over by squirrels that had built several nests.
The area around the ventilator shaft was excavated in controlled and well- documented units, exposing the tunneling network and allowing a space for the masonry workers to rebuild the back wall of the.

Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument Emergency Repair of the Abo Drainage System - $116,400 In 1984, a drainage system was installed at the AbÃ³ site unit of Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument.
A six- inch PVC pipe with half- inch perforations was laid in a squarely cut trench lined with a polypropylene plastic liner.
This liner extended around all three sides of the trench and over the top on either side, covering the ground surface from wall to wall.
The bottom of the trench was filled with a layer of aggregate upon which, the six- inch perforated pipe was laid.
The trench was then filled with aggregate and a single layer of petromat was laid over the aggregate to serve as a silt screen.
A thin layer of soil was placed over the silt screen bringing the trench back to surface level.
This drain design was installed around the entire perimeter of the Kiva Court in the adjacent corridors and into adjoining rooms.
Three barrel traps were installed to serve as catchments and to direct the collected water beyond the perimeter walls.
While the drain appeared to function unerringly for the first year after installation, subsequent years demonstrated that the drain not only ceased to work, but actually exacerbated the very problem it

was intended to solve.
The lay of the pipe allowed water to pass right through to the aggregate below and travel along the plastic liner with no means of escape.
Since the plastic liner went from wall to wall, ground moisture was prevented from entering the drain or evaporating through the ground surface.
The petromat clogged with silt, preventing most of the surface water from entering the drain.
The combined effect of clogged mat and monolithic plastic sheeting actually redirected moisture to the masonry walls, the only means of escape.
The result was a wicking action through the masonry and increased salt deposition and rapid erosion.
In 2002, Salinas Pueblo Missions, in concert with the Vanishing Treasures Program, removed the drain system from the AbÃ³ Convento.
The Salinas Ruins Preservation Crew Â­ many of whom were involved with the original installation and knew the design particulars Â­ engaged in the removal of the failed drain system.
The project involved excavating the surface soil to the petromat, removing the petromat, and reopening the drain.
Soil, gravel and piping were carefully removed to ensure the protection of undisturbed cultural fill.
After cleaning the trench and installing copper date tags, the trench was refilled with sterile soil and packed.
Finally, the Convento was regraded to manage surface moisture through positive flow patterns, directing water to the perimeter and away from the structure.
While a small backhoe was used to do some excavating, the majority of the project involved several months of dedicated hand and wheel work to shovel tons of soil and aggregate out of the trench and return sterile soil to the trench.
infiltrated and trapped in the walls led to mortar deterioration, thus wall collapse was inevitable.
The presence of pre- historic fabric being exposed constituted careful removal of remaining destabilized masonry wall sections.
Sections of wall that were not affected by the rain were not disturbed.
Upon removal, a solid stone foundation had to be established in different areas along this wall.
Natural mud mortar was used, as has been the case historically.
A photograph was used as reference in setting the stones back in their original setting.
The work was carefully documented, in photographs and writing.
The work will be documented in a year- end stabilization report.
During this project, a one- week stabilization workshop was also conducted at the upper cliff dwelling.
Participants from other parks participated at no cost to Tonto.
Tumacacori National Historical Park Mission Preservation - $40,000 This funding was utilized to conduct treatment intervention on the park's three primary resources, Missions San Jose de Tumacacori, San Cayetano de Calabazas and Los Santos Angeles de Guevavi.
Treatment intervention at San Jose de Tumacacori consisted of replacing the deteriorated ledge adobes on the east and north side of the Franciscan Church.
Preservation consisted of minor repairs to missing plasters in the Granary and Convento.
San Cayetano de Calabazas received capping intervention and re- pointing of the historic stone walls of the mission.
Additionally, the site received `brushing' as weeds had encroached on the historic scene and mission walls.
Los Santos Angeles de Guevavi received treatment in the form of wall capping and site `brushing'.
These sites had experienced severe loss of fabric due to an excessive amount of rainfall during the previous year.
In this cycle, over 280 feet of fabric were treated and plasters conserved.
Tonto National Monument Stabilize Collapsed Rockwall at the Upper Cliff Dwelling - $27,000 Tonto received funding for a project to stabilize a collapsed retaining stone masonry wall at the upper cliff dwelling.
The funds acquired through the VT Program were used to hire two seasonal laborers and one YCC worker.
Heavy rainfalls in previous years have contributed to the severity of damage along the drip line areas of the dwelling.

Section 7 - Advisory and Workgroup Activities This section provides a brief update on the activities and accomplishments of VT's Advisory and Workgroups.
The efforts devoted to accomplishing the tasks of these Groups are done by a number of individuals as a secondary or collateral duty.
VT's Program Coordinator, Structural Engineer, and Historical Architect are the only exception.
VT's Program Coordinator is required to dedicate a least 50% of his time to performing program management duties.
In FY 2003, the duties of the Program Coordinator will be performed by an individual that will dedicate 100% of his or her time to the Vanishing Treasures Program.
VT's Structural Engineer, who has been on duty since FY 2000, and the soon to be hired Historical Architect, are required to dedicate 100% of their time to the Vanishing Treasures Initiative.
greatly missed by his fellow VT superintendents and most of the personnel directly involved in VT.
We therefore are taking this opportunity to thank Butch for what he did for VT and wish him much success in his future endeavors.
To fill in behind Butch, Steve Whitesell, Superintendent of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park has been asked to temporarily fill the vacancy until the formal election process can be initiated Executive Advisory Committee There have also been changes to the Executive Advisory Committee.
These changes occurred with the reassignment of Ernst Ortega to the State Coordinator position for the State of New Mexico.
Cec Matic, our Public Affairs Office, has been assigned to work with Ernst in the State Coordinators office.
Because of this move both individual are not able to assist VT. Again, there is significance in the loss of both these folks.
Both Ernest and Cec have been involved in VT since its inception.
We greatly appreciate the help, advice, and council.
Certainly without their help, VT would not have seen the success that it has.
To fill this vacancy, we have asked Jim Bellamy, the newly assigned Chief of Cultural Resources for the Intermountain Region to serve in Ernst's capacity.
We have yet to determine how we will address the staffing needs of the public affairs end of VT. Advisory Group As noted in last years report, the Advisory Group saw the resignation of a two of its members; one assigned and one elected.
We still have yet to fill these positions in accordance with the Advisory Group By- Laws, but have placed one individual in one of vacancies on a temporary basis.
Currently, Phil Wilson, VT's Career Development Workgroup Leader is substituting in one of these positions until the formal election process can be initiated.
Preston Fisher, VT's Structural Engineer, will serve on the Advisory Group as a permanent member.
VT Personnel FY 2002 saw some change in the personnel involved in the leadership, technical, and advisory side of VT. Minor changes occurred in the Leadership Committee, one of the Workgroups, and with the Executive Advisors.
A complete listing of the personnel involved in VT can be found in Table 7- 1.
Leadership Committee In the middle of FY 2002 we witnessed the resignation of Butch Wilson, Superintendent of Chaco Culture National Historical Park from the Leadership Committee.
Regrettably, because of a change in duties that no longer involved VT resources, Butch was unable to continue his involvement with VT.
In terms of the history of VT, this is a pretty significant event.
Butch has been involved with VT since the beginning.
He was one of the original three superintendents that responded to the concerns raised by their respective staffs regarding their inabilities to address core responsibilities because of a lack of funding and staff.
Not being one to pass up an opportunity to market the needs of his park, Butch stepped up and admirably promoted the importance and needs of the VT, and not only did it to benefit Chaco, but all of the parks involved in Vanishing Treasures.
Butch will be, and has been,

Workgroups There has also been a minor shuffling of members on the various workgroups.
Most of these changes are the result of folks changing jobs and no longer having any involvement with VT resources.
Some of these changes are addressed in the various Workgroup reports presented below.
Database Workgroup The Database Workgroup, as outlined in the Long Range Plan for Vanishing Treasures (the Long Range Plan is available at the VT web site at www.cr.nps.gov/aad/vt/vt.htm), was tasked with four main goals.
These include: 1) develop a standardized system to gauge inventory and condition assessment, and to track accomplishments and deferred work load, 2) develop an electronic method for submission of the resource data gathered in goal one and work towards interfacing related software systems, 3) design a system to prioritize funding requests, and 4) develop management systems that will aid planning future work.
Goals 1 and 2 have been accomplished with the creation of the Vanishing Treasures database.
The database has, for a couple of years, been completed and fully integrated into the National Park Service system- wide Archeological Sites Management Information System (ASMIS).
ASMIS is the service- wide database for tracking archeological resources in NPS managed lands.
Goal 3 was accomplished by the by the Advisory Group to incorporate the VT Program into the Special Emphasis Program Allocation System (SEPAS).
Goal 4 has largely been subsumed by individual park in- house efforts and with the integration of the VT database with ASMIS.
Early on it was determined that many parks have already made substantial investments in identifying future planning needs with regards to VT resources.
However, there are some parks that have a genuine need in this area.
That is one of the main reasons why VT opted to have the database incorporated into ASMIS.
ASMIS, combined with the VT database, can be used to manage and track condition, work needs, impacts, and current status of VT and other park resources in one integrated system.
With the primary goals of the Database Workgroup accomplished, the workgroup is
charged with developing the VT web site.
The workgroup envisions a web site that will serve as an information kiosk to interested persons seeking more information about the Vanishing Treasures Program.
In addition, the web site should serve as a clearinghouse of technical information to be shared among all VT parks.
Items such as preservation plans, scopes- of- work, environmental assessments, documentation forms, and final reports can be shared with other parks facilitating project planning, compliance, recording, and reporting.
The first objective of the web site has been accomplished, however it needs updating.
We are still in the formative stages on developing the second component of the web site.
In the near future the Database Workgroup will be soliciting ideas from people to formulate ideas on what exactly the VT Program needs in a data clearinghouse web site.
Career Development Workgroup The Career Development Workgroup is charged with formulating and implementing a plan that will result in the recruitment of a qualified and highly skilled workforce, and the retention and continued training of this workforce.
Implementation of both aspects will ensure the effectiveness of the Vanishing Treasures Program and the NPS both today and in the future.
The workgroup suggests that these goals may be met by providing assistance to parks through the refinement of position descriptions and by providing guidance regarding available recruiting methods.
The workgroup also believes that longterm training is best served by developing courses of instruction that combine formal training, mentoring programs (formal and informal), on the job training opportunities, and cooperative training outside of the organization.
This year, several workgroup members including Eric Brunneman, Kaisa Barthuli and Rodger Waters were forced to resign from because of conflicts with their primary duties.
Eric, Kaisa and Rodger had made significant contributions to the workgroup and the Vanishing Treasures Initiative and there presence will be sorely missed.
On a more positive note, Jim Kendrick, Vanishing Treasures Archeologist (El Malpais) has joined the workgroup.

EAR END REPORT
Â­ FY2002/2003
In FY 2002, the workgroup continued working on the goals identified in FY2000 to: Â· identify areas in which we could assist parks in recruiting and hiring qualified candidates; Â· work to develop a formal competency based preservation training program which could be made available to outside agencies, as well as institutions of higher learning; Â· identify and sponsor essential preservation training until a formal curriculum and training plan can be implemented.
Pre- Recruitment and Recruitment Strategies Over the last several years, the workgroup identified several aspects of the recruitment and hiring process where we could provide assistance, as needed, to parks filling Vanishing Treasures positions.
These aspects included: Â· providing concise and accurate information regarding the range of hiring authorities available to parks; Â· developing strategies to expand recruitment; Â· offering assistance with position development to assist program managers in filling positions earlier in the fiscal year; Â· clarifying the relationship between the Vanishing Treasures Initiative and other programs such as Resource Careers; Â· assisting parks, as requested, in developing appropriate Vanishing Treasures position management plans; Â· providing critical review and modification of exiting Vanishing Treasures position descriptions to better reflect the diversity of resources as well as preservation skills required by each park; Â· ensuring position descriptions and KSA's reflect skills in the core areas of resource documentation, treatment, conservation, and assessment and; Â· Continuing to work towards appropriate classification and titling of Vanishing Treasures positions to ensure recognition of employee skills and expertise.
In 2002, the group continued working with Personnel Specialist Anita Hansen (Denver) and
Carol Brito (Santa Fe) to complete the work initiated in 2001: 1.
Re- writing several Position Descriptions for Masonry and Craft Specialist positions; 2.
Identifying and/or developing essential competencies for the positions; 3.
Creating a career ladder position within the Wage Grade Series similar to the GS- 7/9/11 positions, 4.
Identifying the preservation training and experience required to achieve the competencies and skill levels necessary for the career ladder position.
The majority of this work is complete and is represented by a standard Position Description for Maintenance Worker (Historic Preservation) that reflects the type of work associated with Ruins and Historic structure preservation.
The Position Description is available at the WG- 5/7/8/9 levels and can be linked in a competency- based developmental series to provide a career ladder for the employee.
The workgroup also completed an addendum that can be used to add Leader duties and responsibilities to these positions.
In the coming year, the workgroup will continue to offer assistance to parks to aid in the recruitment and hiring process, and will be actively working with several parks and personnel specialist for the 2003 hire.
The workgroup will also be working to complete standard Position Descriptions for the Exhibit Specialist series.
Employee Training and Development In developing an effective ruins preservation training program, the variety and complexity of the resources must be recognized.
Each position within the Vanishing Treasures program faces unique requirements and challenges.
Vanishing Treasures, park- based program managers need both practical and management skills, while preservation specialists may be called upon to participate in all levels of assessment, documentation, treatment, conservation, and management.
The workgroup, in line with the National Park Service's competency- based training program, views the development of
7-3
NATIONAL P
ARK SERVICE
Â­ APRIL 2003
competencies as a systematic approach to developing Vanishing Treasures employees.
Working towards this end, the group views the three types of training previously identified, apprenticeship /mentoring, academic course work, and workshops as integral aspects of a holistic training program.
Such a program would include a formal curriculum that accounts for a range of positions, and the diversity of preservation related skills.
This year, the workgroup continued working to identify various elements of a ruins preservationtraining curriculum and has enlisted the aid of the Historic Preservation Training Center staff in developing the training curriculum.
Unfortunately, a planned safety and scaffold training session had to be canceled.
However, the workgroup did assist in sponsoring a Symposium on Backfilling that was held at Pecos and will be using the outcome of the symposium to develop guidelines on backfilling for the Vanishing Treasures Initiative.
We were able to hold a number of formal and informal workshops.
Four workshops of significance were held at Bandelier, the Kinishba Ruin on the White Mountain Apache Reservation, and two workshops at the College of Eastern Utah in Blanding, Utah.
The workgroup continued to expand its collaboration with the College of Eastern Utah and the Utah State Historic Preservation Officer in the development of a ruins preservation training program.
The two highly successful workshops coordinated by Larry Nordby and Todd Metzger (with Larry, Todd, a number of Mesa Verde staff, and contractor Larry Baker of Salmon Ruins Museum serving as instructors), with more scheduled in the near future, have gone a long way towards developing a comprehensive ruins preservation curriculum.
Once this is completed it should be a relatively simple process to implement a formal, competency- based NPS, ruins preservation training program.
The workgroup in collaboration with the folks listed above expects to make significant progress towards these goals in the near future.
Workshops and Priority Training While personnel issues and development of a formal training program are essential goals of the workgroup, we recognize that there is a current and continuing need for annual preservation training, as personnel change and new preservation techniques and methods are developed.
With this in mind, the workgroup will work closely with park program managers and preservation specialists to identify and help sponsor essential training (e.g. safety training), and ensure that internal as well as external training opportunities are conveyed to the VT community.
Vanishing Treasures Conference Regrettably, the proposed Vanishing Treasures Working Conference to be held at San Antonio Missions the week of November 18, 2002 was cancelled.
As a result of FY 2003 budget appropriation deliberations, the Department of Interior was directed to reduce it travel costs by several million dollars.
Unfortunately, the cancellation of the conference was viewed as working towards that goal.
Fortunately, NPS leadership has indicated that the cancellation has nothing to do with a lack of support for VT. Rather, the cancellation was due simply to bad timing.
The VT Conference is a very important aspect to VT.
This is an opinion that is held by each every member of the VT's leadership.
We will make every attempt in the future to see that they do occur on an annual basis.
Funding Workgroup As noted in the previous year end report, the efforts of this workgroup have primarily been handled by the VT Leadership Committee.
Similar to last year, efforts in FY 2002 focused on securing and maintaining a funding source specifically dedicated to VT, and providing updates on the status and accomplishments of the Initiative to the National Park Service Washington Office staff and various Congressional members and their staff.
Clearly, these efforts have raised the level of awareness of the Vanishing Treasures Program, and have worked to put into place the appropriate

mechanisms to insure consistent and increasing levels of funding over the next 10- 15 years.
Inclusion of Pacific West Region Parks One of the significant accomplishments this year was the expansion of the Program into the Pacific West Region.
The expansion occurred as a result of our efforts to be responsive to some of the parks in the arid west that were known to contain cultural resources that met the definition of a VT resources and that had indicated an interest in being involved in VT.
After a lengthy review process, Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and Mojave National Preserve were incorporated into the Vanishing Treasures Program.
These parks now have the ability to compete for VT project funding and will eventually be able to compete for personnel once the existing hiring priority list is exhausted.
If the projected FY 2003 budget figures are not reduced, Death Valley and Joshua will be receiving funding for a high priority preservation project.
Guidelines and Standards Workgroup Once again, we have very little to report on the finalization of the VT Ruins Preservation Guidelines.
They are still in draft format, but nonetheless serve as the document by which all VT activities are guided.
A copy of the draft document is posted on VT's Web Page, and distribution of hard copies has been made to all VT parks and all interested individuals.
Work continues towards the production of a final draft document.
It is our hope that it will be distributed sometime during the summer of 2003 for internal NPS review.
It is expected that partner and stakeholder review will occur during the fall or early winter of 2003.
If this time- line can be maintained, it is expected that a final document will be available by the end of the calendar year.

Houston Rogers (December 10, 1968 Â­ December 22, 2002) This report is dedicated to the memory of Houston Rogers.
Houston was killed in a motorcycle accident Sunday morning, December 22, 2002 near Tubac, Arizona.
Several memorial services were held for Houston.
On Christmas Eve, during the annual luminaria night, staff at Tumacacori NHP and friends from Tubac gathered in the mission church in tribute to Houston.
A family service was held in Vega, Texas, on December 28.
A final memorial service was held on February 9, 2002 at Pecos National Historical Park and attended by a number of NPS personnel and coworkers of Houston.
Houston was 34 at the time of his death.
He was an archaeologist in the Vanishing Treasures Program at Tumacacori where he was developing a method for documenting preservation work on adobe ruins.
Houston was the son of NPS Retiree Jerry Rogers.
As most of you know, Jerry has been instrumental in the establishment and continued success of the Vanishing Treasures Initiative.
Born on December 10, 1968, in Arlington, Virginia, Houston was a 1987 graduate of McLean High School and a cum laude graduate in 1995 from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU).
An innovative and energetic thinker, Houston was in the early stages of a promising career with the National Park Service.
He had participated in an archaeological study of the diet of 18th century enlisted men at Fort Laramie National Historic Site, worked for the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office, and participated in the archaeological survey at Pecos National Historical Park.
Although the written word cannot do justice in capturing the meaning and significance of someone's life and the impact that individual may have had on family members, friends and coworkers, there have been a number of heart felt recitations of Houston's life written, with the most poignant one appearing in the National Park Services' web site Inside NPS in January.
To the friends and family of Houston, please know that Houston had a significant impact on all of us within Vanishing Treasures community.
Although our grief and sorrow cannot begin to compare to yours, the loss to us is great.
To Houston's peers and coworkers, you have an obligation to insure that the goals and standards that Houston was trying to achieve are fully realized.
