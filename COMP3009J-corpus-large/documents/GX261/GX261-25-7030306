Prostate Cancer Awareness Prostate cancer is the most common type of malignant cancer found in American men and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men, after lung cancer.
The American Cancer Society predicts there will be about 180,400 new cases of prostate cancer in this country in the year 2000.
About 31,900 men will die of this disease.
The Texas Cancer Registry estimates that in the year 2000, over 10,000 cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in Texas, about 2,000 of them fatal.
The death rate climbed annually from 1980 to 1993 and has not declined significantly since then. lthough men of any age can get prostate cancer, it is detected most often in men over 50.
In fact, more than 8 out of 10 men with prostate cancer are over the age of 65.
Deaths from prostate cancer in Texas are about twice as common among African American men as they are among White American men (Figure 1).
(Incidence data for 1998 are not yet available.)
It is also most common in America and northwestern Europe.
It is less common in Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America.
A
rate is 100%.
If the cancer has spread to tissues near the prostate, the survival rate is 94%.
And if the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body when it is found, about 31% of patients will live at least 5 years.
Early prostate cancer often has no symptoms.
Although problems with urinating may be a sign of prostate cancer, this problem is more often by a benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Symptoms of advanced prostate cancer may include impotence; hemouria, lymphodenopathy; and pain in the pelvis, spine, hips, or ribs.

Prevention The exact cause of prostate cancer is unknown.
Recent research suggests that genetic changes are linked to about 10% of prostate cancers.
While all men are at risk for prostate cancer, the factors listed below can increase the chances of having the disease.
Age: the chance of getting prostate cancer goes up with age.
Race: for unknown reasons, prostate cancer is more common among African American men than among white men.
Diet: a diet high in fat may play a part in causing prostate cancer.
Family: men with close family members who have had prostate cancer are more likely to get prostate cancer themselves.
Because the exact cause of prostate cancer is not known, it is difficult to establish prevention guidelines.
Since a high-fat diet may be linked to prostate cancer, the American Cancer Society suggests a diet low in animal fat and high in vegetables, fruits, and grains.

Overall, 89% of men with prostate cancer live at least 5 years, and 63% survive at least 10 years.
Not surprisingly, survival depends on how localized the cancer is when detected.
If the cancer is found before it has spread outside the prostate, the 5-year relative survival

Tomatoes, grapefruit, and watermelon are rich in lycopenes, which help prevent damage to DNA and may help lower prostate cancer risk.
These guidelines also provide an overall healthful approach to eating that helps lower the risk for some other types of cancer.
American Cancer Society Prostate Cancer Screening Guidelines Physicians should talk to their patients about the possible risks and benefits of finding and treating the cancer early.
The American Cancer Society recommends that physicians offer the PSA blood test and digital rectal exam to all men over the age of 50 who have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and to younger men who are at high risk: African Americans and close relatives of men who have had prostate cancer.
If the digital rectal exam or a high PSA level suggests cancer, a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) should be done.
Sometimes a biopsy is also indicated.
A needle biopsy can be done under TRUS guidance.
Prostate Cancer Screening There are still many uncertainties about finding prostate cancer early.
Cancers found early by using the prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test or the digital rectal exam are often smaller and have spread less extensively than cancers found because of the symptoms they cause.
Moreover, prostate cancer is unlike many other cancers in that it often grows very slowly.
As previously mentioned, the 5-year survival rate is 100% for men whose cancer has not spread beyond the prostate.
Therefore, it is not clear that treatment will extend the lives of all men who have prostate cancer.
On the other hand, prior to the widespread use of these two tests, most men with prostate cancer were found to have advanced disease at diagnosis, and most died a few years after the cancer was found.
Although diagnosing prostate cancer early may help some men to live longer, it will have no impact on the life span of other men.
The PSA blood test measures a protein (prostate specific antigen) made by prostate cells; results are reported in nanograms per milliliter.
Results 
Results 10 ng/ml are high, and values of 4 to 10 ng/ml are considered borderline.
The higher the PSA level, the more likely the chance of prostate cancer.
While PSA levels tell how likely a man is to have prostate cancer, the results do not provide a definite diagnosis.
Men with a high PSA result are advised to have a biopsy to find out whether or not they have cancer.
Staging Of several systems for determining the extent to which the prostate cancer has spread, the TNM is the one most commonly used.
This staging system gives three key pieces of information: T refers to the Tumor.
There are actually two types of T classifications for prostate cancer.
The clinical stage is based on digital rectal exam, needle biopsy, and transrectal ultrasound findings.
The pathologic stage is based on examination of the entire prostate gland, both seminal vesicles and, in some cases, nearby lymph nodes after removal.
N describes how far the cancer has spread to nearby lymph Nodes.
M shows whether the cancer has Metastasized.
Knowing the clinical stage is important because it can help in making treatment decisions, such as whether a man might benefit from having the prostate removed.
But the clinical stage might not show how much the cancer has spread.
The pathologic stage, determined after Continued F

surgery, is more useful in predicting the outlook for survival.
Men who do not have surgery, of course, do not have a pathologic T stage determination.
Grading To determine how fast the tumor is growing, the Gleason grading system is the one used most often.
Under this system a grade of 2 to 4 means a slower growing tumor.
A number 8 to 10 indicates an aggressive cancer.
The grade is an important factor in making treatment decisions.
Treatment Most of the time, prostate cancer grows very slowly.
Autopsy studies show that many elderly men who died of other diseases also had prostate cancer that neither they nor their doctor were aware of.
But sometimes it can grow quickly, spreading to other parts of the body.
Active treatment of prostate cancer can have dramatic adverse effects on a man's quality of life because of side effects such as impotence and incontinence.
The potential for deadly outcomes of prostate cancer weighed against the potential for greatly reduced quality of life following treatment often makes the decisions regarding management of the disease difficult.
Of the many treatment options for prostate cancer, the choice of the right one for a particular patient depends on a number of factors, including the patient's age and overall health, and the stage and grade of the cancer.
For some patients with prostate cancer, the best choice may be expectant
therapy (also calledwatching and waiting, watchful waiting, and deferred therapy) with no immediate active treatment.
Watchful waiting may be recommended if a cancer is not causing any symptoms, is expected to grow very slowly, and is small and contained within one area of the prostate.
This choice does include medical care and followup: the cancer is carefully and regularly monitored.
Usually this approach includes a PSA blood test and digital rectal exam every six months, plus yearly transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate.
If a man develops bothersome symptoms or his cancer begins to grow more quickly, decisions about active treatment can be reconsidered.
A large study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program is looking into how active treatment affects survival and quality of life of prostate cancer patients of different ages.
The PIVOT (short for Prostatic Intervention versus Observation Trial) is still in progress and its results are eagerly awaited.
Since 1995, experts from 17 of the nation's leading cancer centers, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), have been developing cancer treatment guidelines for cancer care professionals.
An overview of the most common treatment prostate cancer treatment options is available from several sources, listed on the back page of this issue.
