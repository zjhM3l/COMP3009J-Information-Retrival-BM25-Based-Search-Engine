003051 Filed 2900; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 431070F Recommendations Regarding Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Control of Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
After full and careful consideration of the information and statements submitted and presented by representatives of the Hopi Tribe and Chaco Culture National Historical Park at its meetings on May 35, 1999 and November 1820, 1999, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee (Review Committee) considers that: 1.
On May 12, 1999, Chaco Culture National Historical Park published a Notice of Inventory Completion regarding 265 Native American human remains and 743 funerary objects.
The park determined the human remains and funerary objects to be culturally affiliated with the Hopi Tribe of Arizona; Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah; Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico; Pueblo of Cochiti, New Mexico; Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico; Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico; Pueblo of Nambe, New Mexico; Pueblo of Picuris, New Mexico; Pueblo of Pojoaque, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Felipe, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Ildefonso, New Mexico; Pueblo of San Juan, New Mexico; Pueblo of Sandia, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Ana, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico; Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico; Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico; Pueblo of Tesuque, New Mexico; Pueblo of Zia, New Mexico; and the Zuni Tribe of Zuni Reservation, New Mexico.
2.
The Hopi Tribe disputed the park's determinations of cultural affiliation, arguing that: a.
Proper tribe-by-tribe consultation was not performed by the park; b.
The park did not apply a rigorous standard in weighing the evidence in making determinations of cultural affiliation; and c. Determinations of cultural affiliation must be made on an objectby-object basis, rather than globally for the park as a whole.
3.
Chaco Culture National Historical Park answered these objections by pointing to a nine-year record of tribal consultations.
The park also argued that there is cultural continuity within Chaco Canyon dating to the Archaic Period (pre 1 AD) and that as such, there was no value in assessing cultural affiliation for each site individually.
The park defended its determinations of cultural affiliation on the grounds that a broad range of both scientific and traditional evidence had been used.
It was also noted that given the complex history of Chaco Canyon, and the strong DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR National Park Service Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee: Findings AGENCY: National Park Service, Department of the Interior.

For example, the Review Committee believes that the park should engage a qualified independent contractor to re-evaluate the information from the Chaco sites and offer specific recommendation for cultural affiliation.
Review Committee member James Bradley did not participate in the Review Committee's deliberations nor in the formulation of these advisory findings and recommendations.
These advisory findings and recommendations do not necessarily represent the views of the National Park Service or the Secretary of the Interior.

003053 Filed 2900; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 431070F traditional attachment that the place held for many tribes, it was not surprising that many groups should be considered culturally affiliated.
On hearing all of the evidence presented, the Review Committee finds that the complaints made by the Hopi Tribe have merit.
While the Review Committee recognizes the efforts made in the area of tribal consultation, tribes were not given adequate opportunity to consult on a one-to-one basis and to make their concerns known outside of a public forum.
The Review Committee also agrees with the Hopi Tribe that more is needed in the evaluating and weighing of the evidence for establishing cultural affiliation.
Rather than a rigorous determination of cultural affiliation, the park seems to have applied a much looser criterion of cultural relationship to geographical place, as a basis for determining culturally affiliated tribes.
The park's global approach to the assessment Chaco archeological sites, effectively precluded any realistic assessment of cultural affiliation based on specific site features, dates, or cultural practices.
Likewise, sites with virtually no contextual information were treated as culturally affiliated.
The global approach to site assessment and affiliation resulted in a determination of cultural affiliation for all Chaco Canyon remains with all groups expressing cultural relationship to the region.
It is the recommendation of the Review Committee that the Chaco Culture National Historical Park withdraw its published Notice if Inventory Completion and reassess its determination of cultural affiliation.
The Review Committee recommends that this reassessment specifically consider the following issues: 1.
Determination of cultural affiliation should be made on a site-by-site basis, assessing each site based on the specific data available; 2.
While collective consultation can be useful, it should not be used in lieu of individual tribal consultation when requested by an Indian tribe; 3.
A proper determination of cultural affiliation necessarily requires the critical evaluation and careful weighing of all available evidence.
This weighing should emphasize group identity, time period, specific cultural practices, and traceable cultural continuity; 4.
The park should take steps to ensure the objective character of the determinations of cultural affiliation of the human remains and other cultural items in the control of the park.
The process the park follows in making cultural affiliation determinations also must be seen by others to have been DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR National Park Service Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains From Rockbridge County, VA in the Possession of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, Richmond, VA AGENCY: ACTION: National Park Service.
Notice.
Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 43 CFR 10.9, of the completion of an inventory of human remains from Rockbridge County, VA in the possession of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, Richmond, VA.
A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by Virginia Department of Historic Resources professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Chickahominy, the Eastern Chickahominy, the Mattaponi, the Monacan Indian Nation, the Nansemond, the Pamunkey, the United Rappahannock, the Upper Mattaponi, all non-Federally recognized Indian groups which are formally recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia.
In 1901, human remains representing a minimum of 105 individuals were excavated from the Hayes Creek Mound, Rockbridge County, VA by Edward P. Valentine, an amateur archeologist with the Valentine Museum, Richmond, VA.
In 1989, these human remains were donated to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources by the Valentine Museum.
No known individuals were identified.
No associated funerary objects are present.
Based on material culture and archeological evidence, the Hayes Creek Mound site has been identified as a Late Woodland (c. 9001600 A.D.) occupation.
Based on the material culture and condition of the human remains, these individuals have been identified as Native American.
Archeological and ethnohistoric research indicates the Monacan and Mannahoac were loosely confederated with each other and linked to the earlier mound-building peoples in the Virginia piedmont and eastern mountain regions generally known as the Lewis Creek Mound Culture.
Consultation evidence presented by the present-day Monacan indicates a direct lineal connection with the Monacan and related tribes occupying Rockbridge County in the early 17th century.
Based on continuities of mound construction and site arrangement, there appears to be a shared ideology and cultural continuity which underlayed and defined not only the Monacan east of the Blue Ridge, but also includes related groups on the immediate west side of the Blue Ridge.
On October 29, 1999, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources requested a finding from the NAGPRA Review Committee concerning the Monacan Indian Nation's request for repatriation for these 105 individuals listed as ``culturally unidentifiable'' on the Department's NAGPRA inventory.
At its November 1820, 1999 meeting, the NAGPRA Review Committee recommended that the Department proceed with repatriation of these Native American human remains to the Monacan Indian Nation following publication of this Notice of Inventory Completion in the Federal Register.
Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources have determined that, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.2 (d)(1), the human remains listed above represent the physical remains of a minimum of 105 individuals of Native American ancestry.
Officials of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), no relationship of shared group identity can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and a Federally recognized Indian tribe.
However, officials of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources have determined that a relationship of shared group identity can be reasonably traced between these Native American human remains and the Monacan Indian VerDate 272000 19:29 Feb 09, 2000 Jkt 190000 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\10FEN1.SGM pfrm01 PsN: 10FEN1
