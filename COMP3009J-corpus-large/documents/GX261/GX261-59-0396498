T HE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF INDIANA
This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Geological Survey, Indiana Department of Natural Resources, for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.
Indiana ranked 21st among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value1 in 1996, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Although dropping from a ranking of 20th in 1995, Indiana's 1996 estimated value of $617 million was nearly a 5% increase from that of 1995.
This followed a more than 6% increase from 1994 to 1995 (based on final 1995 data).
Indiana's nonfuel mineral production value exceeded $600 million for the first time in its history in 1996.
The State accounted more than 1.5% of the U.S. total nonfuel mineral production value.
Indiana's increase in nonfuel mineral value mostly resulted from an 11% increase in the value of crushed stone and a 14% increase in construction sand and gravel.
Compared with those of 1995, other values that increased were those of gypsum, common clays, and peat.
Mineral commodities that showed a decrease in value included portland cement, lime, masonry cement, dimension stone, and gemstones.
Compared with USGS estimates of the quantities of minerals produced in the other 49 States during 1996, Indiana remained first in dimension stone, second in masonry cement, and seventh in gypsum.
Additionally, the State was a significant producer of crushed stone, portland cement, construction sand and gravel, lime and common clays.
The State's mines exclusively produce industrial minerals and coal; all raw steel and primary aluminum produced in the State are processed from materials received from other domestic and foreign sources.
Indiana continued to lead the Nation in the production of raw steel with an estimated output of close to 21 million metric tons (23 million short tons), according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
The State remained third in the production of primary aluminum.
The following narrative information was provided by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS).2 In 1996, two limestone quarries were opened in Orange County.
Mulzer Crushed Stone, Inc., opened a new quarry at Abydel west of Paoli, and Rogers Group, Inc., reopened an old quarry near Orleans.
Both quarries will produce scrubber stone for coal-fired electric utilities with wet flue gas desulfurization systems.
Mulzer Crushed Stone, Inc., announced plans to open a quarry in Harrison County.
The county approved significant tax abatements to encourage the development.
This quarry would also be primarily producing limestone for scrubber stone.

The property is being sold to Rogers Group, Inc., who is reapplying for a zoning permit.
Following an appeal by opponents, the Indiana Court of Appeals upheld a decision by the Monroe County Zoning Board to allow development of Hillside Stone Co.'s planned underground crushed limestone mine west of Bloomington.
The Indiana Limestone Institute reported that 1996 was a very good year for the State's dimension limestone industry.
Construction projects for which Indiana quarries were providing stone included: federal courthouses in Sacramento, CA, and Portland, OR; the Niketown store in NewYork; the North Carolina Museum of Natural History in Raleigh, NC; Catherwood Library on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY; and Doubleday Field at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY. Restoration projects were also underway of the Empire State Building and the Waldorf Astoria in New York City.
The Indiana Limestone Company, Inc., came under new management during the year.
Plans were made to update and modernize the company's equipment and new office facilities were constructed.
Additionally, the company finished the International Cultural and Trade Center for the Federal Triangle project in Washington, DC earlier in 1996.
Silver Creek Sand 
Irving Materials, Inc., experienced zoning problems in its attempt to open a sand and gravel pit in Johnson County.
ESSROC Materials, Inc.'s, Speed Cement Plant in Clark County, investigated the option of setting up a citizen's advisory committee to deal with neighborhood concerns.
ESSROC quarries some of the materials used at its Speed Plant.
The Hoosier National Forest agreed to a `land for mineral right's swap' with the United States Gypsum Corp.
(USG) in which the forest will gain a total of 281 hectares including unique karst areas, and USG will gain the right to mine less than 470 hectares of national forest in Martin County.
Regarding federal environmental grants, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) will INDIANA--1996 1 henceforth identify needed programs in the State with the help of other public and business groups.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will then work with IDEM to establish goals and methods of measuring progress toward those goals and will award the State one lump-sum grant instead of multiple project-specific grants as in the past.
The Indiana Department of Natural Resources published the Indiana Wetlands Conservation Plan funded by a grant from the EPA.
In aggregate news, a final version of the Indiana Department of Transportation's (INDOT) regulation ITM 203-96, which defines how an aggregate producer supplies stone for an INDOT contract, was released, including the new requirement to use metric units.
A national conference called Superpave 2000 was held in Indianapolis during August.
Trips were made to Superpave sites and testing centers in Indiana, including a portion of I-70.
The I-70 project includes a German-made asphalt tape joint sealant, the first project in the nation to use this method.
A draft environmental impact statement could find no insurmountable environmental problems in extending I-69 from Indianapolis to Evansville, but was criticized by the EPA for being incomplete and for not sufficiently examining alternatives.
Public hearings were held around the State in May and June.
INDOT sent out an invitation to engineering firms to help plan the highway.
Seven companies were chosen to design portions of the extension.
The steel industry had a very active year in 1996.
In November, AK Steel Corp. announced that it would build a state-of-the-art steel finishing plant near Rockport, Spencer County.
This proposed plant was among, if not, the most expensive business development in the nation during 1996 at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion with State and local business incentives totaling $72 million.
The plant will be 65 kilometers southeast of the new Toyota pickup truck plant being constructed near Princeton, Gibson County, and will be a major supplier of steel for Toyota, as well as for other industries in the region.
Completion of the steel plant was anticipated for September 1998.
Plans were underway to make many regional road improvements to service the new business developments.
In other industry news, Chicago Cold Rolling LLC, a $50 million steel minimill, was scheduled to open at Burns Harbor, Porter County, in 1997.
Qualitech Steel Corp. moved its site for a minimill to the Pittsboro area, Hendricks County, after facing significant opposition in Brownsburg.
Inland Steel Co., Lake County, planned to spend $240 million to make improvements to its plant.
Inland also entered into an agreement with a Tennessee company to build a coking facility for the plant.
Excess heat produced by the process will be converted into electricity for the plant.
Bethlehem Steel Corp., Porter County, offered to donate steel for a new $74.9 million high school at Chesterton.
The company announced that it was looking for new suppliers of lime and limestone.
In April, Bethlehem Steel Corp. and Inland Steel Co. were fined by the EPA for water and air pollution violations.
Air pollution fines against US Steel Corp. and LTV Steel Co., both in Lake County, will be used to help clean up other environmental problems in those areas.
A new 62-page Directory of Industrial Mineral Producers in Indiana, Indiana Geological Survey D13, was published in January.
The directory was also available in spreadsheet form on a 3.5-inch computer disk.
Updates of maps showing active mine locations in Indiana were completed in 1996: map MM55, Map of Indiana Showing Bedrock Units Containing Thick Deposits of Limestone an d Dolomite and Locations of Coal-Fired Electric Power Plants and Crushed-Stone Mines, and map MM57, Map of Indiana Showing Locations of Coal-Fired Electric Power Plants, Crushed-Stone Mines, and Federal and State Highways.
Map MM41, Map of Indiana Showing Locations of Coal and Industrial Minerals Operations, was revised and was scheduled to be available in 1997.
---------- 1 The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 1996 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are estimates as of Feb. 1997.
For some commodities, e.g., construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement, estimates are up dated periodically.
