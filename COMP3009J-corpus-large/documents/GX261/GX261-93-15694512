/ Bo ard of C on trac t Ap pea ls General Services Administration Washington, D.C. 20405 ___________________ August 15, 2001 ____________________ GSBCA 15523-TRAV In the Matter of BRIAN E. HAVITZ Brian E. H avitz, M onro e, OH , Claim ant.
Diana E. Settelmeyer, Chief, Claims and Correction of Records, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver, CO, appearing for Department of Defense.
HYATT , Board Judge.
Claim ant, Brian E. H avitz, is a civilian employee of the National Guard Service of the De partm ents of the Army and the Air Force.
His permanent duty station at the time of travel was the Air National Guard's 123 rd Air Control Squadron in Blue A sh, Ohio.
In August 2000, he perfo rmed a tem porary duty (TDY) assignment at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.
The issue presented to the B oard for re view conc erns M r. Hav itz's return trip to Ohio, which was routed from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Dayton, Ohio, through Chicago, Illinois.
M r. Hav itz landed in Chicago as planned, but was unable to take the connecting flight to Dayton because it had be en overbooked.
Instead of taking a later flight that day, or staying overnight in Chicago and flying to Dayton the next day, claimant rented a car an d dro ve fro m C hicag o to his h ous e in M onr oe, O hio .
Upon his retu rn to O hio, M r. Hav itz requested reimbursement for the cost of the rental car.
When the unused portion of claimant's ticket was turned in, the commercial transportation office (CTO) advised that it would not be possible to obtain a refund for the partial por tion of th e retu rn f ligh t. Ad ditiona lly, although M r. Hav itz was authorized to rent a car while in Utah, his travel orders did not authorize rental of a car to drive from Chicago to Ohio.
The command would like to approve the ex penses; the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) regards the claim as doubtful, expressing the view that claimant drove from Chicago to Ohio for his personal convenience.
DFAS takes the position that the claim mu st be den ied.
Discussion GSBCA 15523-TRAV 2 Under the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), Government employees who travel on official business are expected to use common carriers for transportation unless the authorizing agen cy determ ines tha t an altern ative m eans of trav el is more adva ntage ous to the Government.
41 CFR 301-10.5(a ) (2000).
When the employee does not travel by the method of transportation sele cte d b y the agency, the employee must bear any additional expenses.
Id ., 301-10.6.
The Joint Travel Regula tions (JTR), which apply to civilian employees of the De partm ent of De fens e and supp leme nt t he FTR, contain a similar provision.
JTR C2001-A.3.d.
The reco rd p rov ided to u s do es n ot es tabli sh w heth er M r. H avitz v olun tarily relinquished his seat on the overbooked flight or whether he was denied boarding rights by the airline.
Although the FT R p ermits e mp loyees to voluntarily vacate a seat on a scheduled airline flight to the ex tent it w ill not interf ere w ith of ficia l duties, th e em ployee is nonetheless responsible for any addition al costs incurred.
FTR 301-10.117.
When an employee is "bum ped" invo luntarily, the e mp loyee is gene rally entitled to reimbursement for additional subsistence costs that may be incurred, but is required to ensure that any financial remuneration provided by the airline is mad e payab le to the " Tre asu rer o f the Un ited S tates ."
FTR 301 -10.1 16; Om ar J. N orris , B-224590 (Nov. 10, 1986).
The rationa le und erlying this regulation is that since the Government has contracted with the airline for the reserved seat and may incur additional travel expenses on behalf of the employee denie d the re serve d sea t, it is entitled to the compensation as a form of "liquidated damages."
See John B. Currier, 59 Comp.
Gen .
95 (1979 ); Ch ester S ipkin , B-148879 (Aug. 28, 1970).
The proper disposition of this claim depends, therefore, on whether the relinquishment of the reserved seat was vol unt ary or i nvo lun tary.
To the ex tent M r. Havitz volunteered to give up his reserved seat on the scheduled flight, he is fu lly respon sible fo r the ex cess c osts of travel h e incurred b y renting a car to perform the final leg of his return trip.
In ge neral, Go vern men t emp loyees w ho v olun teer to be bum ped from an ove rbooke d flight are better serv e d to await a later flight, if possible, rather than arrange alternative transportation.
In any eve nt, if claim ant vo luntarily ag reed to give up his seat, while he canno t recou p the c ost of the ren tal car, he is perm itted to re tain any compensation that the airlin e aff orde d him for ag reeing to give up h is seat.
JTR C2201B; Charles E. Armer , 59 Co mp. G en. 203 (1 980).
If Mr. Havitz was involuntarily denied a seat on the plane, the airline was requ ired to book him on another flight to Dayton as soon as possible and, depending on the length of the delay attributable to the need to reschedule, may also have been requ ired to f urnish him w ith compensation.
If th is w oul d ha ve r equ ired an o ver nig ht sta y, Mr .
Havitz may have been entitled to subsistence expenses for lodging and meals and incidental expenses, to the extent the airline w ould not have absorbed these costs.
At the same time, if the airline compensated Mr. Ha vitz f or the loss of his reserved seat, he would be required to turn over that compensation to the Government.
If this is the situation, and Mr. Havitz chose to rent a car and return home rather th an stay ov ernigh t in the Chicago area, he may be compensated for the expense he incurr ed to th e exte nt it does not exceed the cost the Government would have incurred for lodging and per diem as a result of the d elayed travel.
He sho uld, how ever, also remit a ny com pens ation re ceive d fro m the airline to the G over nm ent.
This matter is returned to the agency for disposition in accordance with the above.
