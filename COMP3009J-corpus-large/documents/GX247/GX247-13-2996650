Licensee, Pro se.
ADJUDICATION
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on July 12, 1999, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against Thomas M. Shanaberger, t/a Brownsville Hotel, License Number H-AP-SS-3335 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on April 21, 1999, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on the licensed premises.
The investigation which gave rise to the citation began on November 24, 1997 and was completed on May 5, 1999; and notice of the violation was sent to Licensee by Certified Mail on May 17, 1999.
The notice of violation was received by Licensee on May 18, 1999.
An evidentiary hearing was held on this matter on December 2, 1999 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Upon review of the transcript of this hearing, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:
FINDINGS OF FACT:
1.
Licensee holds Hotel Liquor License Number H-AP-SS-3335 in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.
(N.T. 3)
2.
On April 21, 1999 at 2:00 p.m., enforcement officers conducted an open inspection of the licensed premises and found Licensee, a bartender identified as Michelle Kovalchick, and four patrons present.
(N.T.7-8)
3.
During the inspection, the officers found a New Fruit Bonus 96 video slot machine and a Cherry Master video slot machine set up inside and operational.
(N.T. 8)
4.
The two video slot machines were played and found to contain knock-off devices and were seized and removed from the licensed premises and put into the evidence warehouse.
(N.T. 8-9)
5.
On May 5, 1999 at 1:00 p.m., Enforcement Officer Ceh examined the two video slot machines and found that they accepted U.S. currency in various combinations, awarding 20 credits for each dollar placed into the machine.
(N.T. 10-12-13)
6.
The officer played the machines and found they required no skill to play; had a button to set the number of credits to be bet, and another button which caused the display screen to show various icons or symbols rolling as if on a drum, then stop within nine separate grids on the display screen.
(N.T. 13)
7.
The period of time for play was approximately five to ten seconds.
(N.T. 14)
8.
The machine awarded credits based on the combination of the symbols at the end of the play.
(N.T. 14)
9.
The New Fruit Bonus 96 machine had a knock-off circuit activated by pressing the redeem button.
(N.T. 14)
10.
The Cherry Master video slot machine had a knock-off circuit activated by connecting two boltheads located on the right side of the machine.
(N.T. 14)
11.
Both video slot machines had internal video accounting for determining the number of coins put in as well as the number of credits knocked off.
(N.T. 14)
CONCLUSION OF LAW: Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION:
At the hearing held on the matter, two enforcement officers testified in detail as to the per se gambling characteristics of two video slot machines seized from the licensed premises.
The machines accepted U.S. currency, awarded credits by chance rather than skill, had a knock-off circuit for erasing the credits, and an accounting circuit for recording the number of credits put in and erased.
These characteristics make the two video slot machines so intrinsically connected with gambling as to constitute a gambling device per se.
Commonwealth v. Irwin, 636 A.2d 1106 (Pa. 1993).
Licensee argued that since he had a Borough Amusement Permit (Exhibit L-1) the citation should be dismissed.
He cited an Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas case, Commonwealth v. Kratsas, No.
CC-9412380 (Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas February 26, 1997), aff'd 726 A.2d 1079 (Pa.
Super.
1998) as the basis for his argument.
On cross-examination, he admitted making illegal gambling payoffs on the two video slot machines and that he had been cited for illegal gambling in the past.
(N.T. 21-23).
He knew the two video slot machines were illegal.
Kratsas dealt with a defendant's due process rights in a criminal case.
In the instant case, Mr. Shanaberger is charged with a civil violation of the Liquor Code.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court made a distinction between criminal proceedings and civil proceedings under the Liquor Code, holding that sanctions can be imposed under the Liquor Code when the underlying conduct does not produce any criminal charges.
V.J.R.
Bar Corp. v. Pa.
LCB, 390 A.2d 163 (Pa. 1978).
I find that the two video slot machines were gambling devices per se, that Licensee did not show any due process violation as in Kratsas and further that Kratsas does not apply in this case.
As such, the citation is sustained as charged.
