Window on State Government Carole Keeton Strayhorn, Texas Comptroller __________ [search_blu.gif]-Submit Texas School Performance Review Texas School Performance Review _________________________________________________________________ Christoval Independent School District August 2001 Chapter 2 EDUCATIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY This chapter discusses the Christoval Independent School District's (CISD's) educational service delivery system and student performance measures in five sections: A. Student Performance and Instructional Resources B. Special Programs C. Alternative Education Programs and Dropout Prevention D. Safety and Security
B. SPECIAL PROGRAMS
Other pilot projects in the state are combining technology and educational delivery for gifted and talented students as well.
As part of the Comptroller's e-Texas initiative, four school districts, Paris, Plainview, Pharr-San Juan-Alamo and Donna are participating in a pilot internet program designed to take advantage of the technology offered in the 21^st century that can open many learning opportunities for Texas' students.
In addition, career and technology programs are offered to allow students to gain entry-level employment with the skills necessary to enter a high-skill, high-wage job or continue with post-secondary education once they graduate from high school.
Special Education
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires districts to provide appropriate public education for all children with disabilities regardless of the severity of the handicap.
Education is to be provided in the least restrictive environment, and students with disabilities are to be included in state and district assessment programs.
This law, which is designed to protect children and parents in the educational decision-making process, requires districts to develop an individualized education plan (IEP) for each child.
The IEP should include the input of regular-education teachers and be clearly aligned with those of children in general classrooms.
CISD is a member of the Small Schools Cooperative (cooperative).
The cooperative is one of 137 shared-service arrangements in the state designed to assist member districts in serving and providing educational services to all students with disabilities, ages birth through 21.
The cooperative includes 18 school districts and serves approximately 1,500 students.
Exhibit 2-14 presents the organizational chart for the cooperative.
The management board of the cooperative is composed of superintendents from each member school district.
The management board meets twice each year and elects members to serve on the cooperative's advisory board.
The advisory board meets monthly and is led by the superintendent of the cooperative's fiscal-agent district.
The advisory board's role is limited to decisions involving the daily operations of the cooperative.
Wall ISD serves as the fiscal agent for the cooperative.
As fiscal agent, Wall is responsible for making all applications necessary to qualify and receive funds for the cooperative and for preparing all budgets on behalf of the cooperative.

Overall, there is a wide range between CISD and its peer districts in the number and percentages of students receiving special education services and the number of special education teachers reported in the AEIS reports.
For 1999-2000, CISD has the third highest percentage of students enrolled in special education (19.8 percent), six percentage points higher than the percentage of students statewide identified as receiving special education services.
The majority of students are students with a learning disability.
CISD also has the third largest percentage of special education teachers.
Exhibit 2-16 shows that CISD ranks third in the percentage of actual expenditures allocated to special education, but first in the per-pupil expenditure amount.
CISD spends $5,806 per special education student.
This amount is higher than all other peer districts, slightly lower than the state average of $5,937 per student and lower than the average expenditure of three of its peer districts.

Exhibit 2-17 contains definitions of the primary instructional arrangements.
Exhibit 2-17 CISD Students Enrolled in Special Education Instructional Arrangement Definitions 1999-2000
Description of Basic Programs Mainstream - To ensure the least restrictive environment appropriate for each student, district personnel first consider providing services in regular education with supplementary aids.
Students with disabilities who spend all of their classroom hours in a regular classroom are called "mainstreamed."
Resource - These students have a combination of regular classes and resource classes.
In a resource class, some students are pulled out from the regular classroom for specific instruction or tutoring.
Vocational Adjustment class (VAC) - This setting provides educational and vocational services to eligible secondary students.
Students are instructed in job-readiness skills.
Self-Contained classes - If a student's disability is so severe that satisfactory education cannot take place in a regular classroom, the student will be served in a separate "self-contained" classroom.
Behavior Management Units - (BIP) Special education students who are disruptive in the regular classroom are sent to the BIP, a separate classroom that serves as an in-school alternative placement classroom primarily for emotionally disturbed students.
Adaptive Physical Education - These classes provide specialized physical education curriculum for students who are unable to benefit from the regular physical education program.
Homebound - This program provides at-home services for students at all grade levels that cannot attend school because of illness, injury or expulsion.
Source: TEA Division of Special Education.
Ten CISD special education students are mainstreamed, and 37 are in resource.
Elementary students primarily are served through a pullout program and provided with targeted instruction in the resource classroom.
In grade 5, students are transitioned into an inclusion program so they can adapt to the services provided in junior and high school.
Inclusion is used in grades 6 through 12.
FINDING
The cooperative provides services in a timely and professional manner to participating CISD students.
The cooperative provides a wide range of services that include initial student assessment, equipment, special units, staff training, software and legal updates.
In addition, the cooperative hires teachers and aides for multi-district classes, interpreters for the deaf, contracts with a child/adolescence psychiatrist, psychologists and counselors, physical therapists and occupational therapists.
Homebound services also are provided.
The cooperative operates several multi-district classes designed to meet the needs of these students.
These units are housed in various locations throughout the member districts.
The most valuable services mentioned by staff include the availability of expert diagnosticians, therapists and psychologists; training materials and literature related to various special education topics; and periodic updates to current state and federal regulations and laws.
The cooperative also provides special education units that meet the needs of all CISD students.
The director of the cooperative said that district staff is committed to serving the needs of students and shares responsibility with the cooperative staff.
The cooperative's staff keeps district staff informed regarding legal updates or mandates.
Teachers in CISD also said that if they need materials or need to discuss a specific situation, they can call the cooperative's staff and together they find solutions to issues or problems.
Cooperative staff also works closely with Region 15 to provide services to all member districts.
Over 60 percent of parents agreed or strongly agreed that CISD has an effective special education program.
Ten percent disagreed, and only 5 percent strongly disagreed.
The cooperative provided a technology-based education system, INVEST Learning, for every member district.
The cooperative purchased both the hardware and software for each of the member districts.
The program was installed on a server so additional computer stations can be added in the future.
COMMENDATION
CISD's participation in the Small Schools Cooperative provides excellent services to the district's special education students.
FINDING
CISD does not use adequate pre-referral intervention strategies in regular education.
The cooperative provides helpful information for teachers regarding several special education topics like assessment and referrals transitions, but the training does not focus on preventing unnecessary referrals.
To serve the multiple needs of all students with disabilities and to comply with IDEA's requirements, derived from Public Law 101-15, the 1997 amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, an effective special education program should implement pre-referral intervention practices in regular education.
When a student experiences an academic problem in the regular education program, an intervention can and should occur to solve the problem.
If steps taken to solve the problem by the regular education teacher do not produce results, the problem should be referred to special education staff.
Though teachers provide services for students who are experiencing difficulties, these are not necessarily coordinated or reported.
The special education teachers said that the district has made some efforts in implementing pre-referral practices.
One teacher said "In the past, we used to send the students to the special education teacher.
Now, we think about it a little more.
We try to figure out what we can do...."
No campus-level committee exists to assess students' needs before they are referred to special education.
CISD's pre-referral process does not identify a designated coordinator at each school.
Many districts in Texas have implemented successful pre-referral systems.
Grape Creek ISD has instituted a pre-referral system in the elementary school.
A special education pre-referral committee was formed.
This committee meets when a teacher requests a meeting or when a student is being considered for referral.
A form, Pre-Referral Checklist for Regular Classroom Teachers, is used to ensure that educational efforts and strategies are provided and/or considered for the student prior to referral to special education.
These efforts also are documented for future reference.
Mount Pleasant ISD (MPISD) established the Campus Intervention Team (CIT), designed to "...provide strategies for intervention when a need begins to arise for any student."
Each CIT is made up of one Maximum Achievement Learning Lab (MALL) teacher, the school counselor, the student's classroom teacher and the principal.
Once a teacher fills out a pre-referral form on any student with difficulties, the committee conducts a meeting to discuss the student's needs.
The goal of this process is to identify, document and implement intervention strategies, always considering the least restrictive alternatives first.
According to principals and teachers in MPISD, in 75 to 80 percent of cases, school modifications accomplish needed results with the least restrictive environment for the student.
Recommendation 11:
Create intervention teams at the elementary and secondary schools to refine, enhance, develop and monitor pre-referral practices.
Each school should identify a group of teachers that can serve on a team to implement pre-referral practices.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
Each school principal establishes a Campus Intervention Team (CIT) made up of teachers and determines who will serve on the team.
October 2001 2.
The director of the Small School Cooperative arranges for staff development for all CIT members.
November 2001 3.
Campus principals conduct monthly meetings with the CIT to discuss the effectiveness of the team and to provide continuous feedback.
November 2001 4.
The principal informs parents about CIT procedures.
December 2001 5.
The director of the Small School Cooperative periodically evaluates the CITs to ensure they are actively involved in pre-referral activities and are making appropriate decisions.
Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
The percentage of Hispanic special education students is not representative of the total population of Hispanic students in the district.
Exhibit 2-18 shows the percentage of Hispanic students in the district and the percentage identified for special education services.
Hispanic students are over-represented in the special education program.
Exhibit 2-18 CISD Special Education by Student Group 2000-01

Source: TEA, AEIS 1999-2000 and TEA Special Education Division.
The Special Education Data Analysis System, developed by TEA, conducts a district-level analysis of potential ethnic disproportions of student populations served in special education.
The data analysis system analyzes the percentage of students enrolled in the district's special education by student group.
Risk levels range from "1" to "4."
A risk level "0" means that a student-group's distribution in the special education program is within appropriate margins.
A level "1" indicates that there is a slight discrepancy.
A risk level "4" will trigger a special investigation and, perhaps, a visit from TEA. CISD received a risk-level rating of "3" regarding the percentage of Hispanic students enrolled in the special education program.
This over-representation of Hispanic students in the special education program could signal problems with the identification or pre-referral systems used by the district.
In the Corpus Christi ISD, for example, the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights found that language biases were contributing to over-representation and that assessment and parent communications in Spanish were needed to remove those biases.
Recommendation 12:
Examine the over-representation of specific student groups in special education and ensure that all students are properly assessed and identified to receive special education services.
Assessing the overall referral system and ensuring that services are adequately provided to all students before they are identified to receive special education services will reduce the overrepresentation of specific student groups.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The superintendent directs the special education teachers to review the district's referral process.
October 2001 2.
The director of the cooperative and the diagnosticians work with district staff to identify areas of weakness that may contribute to an overrepresentation of Hispanic students in the special education program.
October 2001 3.
The teachers, diagnosticians and the director of the cooperative make necessary modifications to ensure that overrepresentation does not occur.
October - December 2001 4.
The director of the cooperative and the teachers periodically review the number of students identified for special education to ensure that all students are properly identified.
Fall 2002 and Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
Gifted and Talented
Texas state law requires all school districts to identify and provide services for gifted and talented students.
Section 29.122 of the Texas Education Code (TEC) states that school districts "shall adopt a process for identifying and serving gifted and talented students in the district and shall establish a program for those students in each grade level."
In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.
This plan is a guide for meeting the law's requirements.
In 1996, the SBOE updated the plan to incorporate TEC Section 29.123 requirements.
The updated plan forms the basis for program accountability for state-mandated services for gifted and talented students.
Exhibit 2-19 shows enrollment figures and expenditure amounts for the gifted and talented program in CISD and its peer districts.
Exhibit 2-19 Number and Percent of Gifted/Talented Students and Teachers Actual 1999-2000 Expenditures CISD, Peer Districts, Region 15 and State 1999-2000

*Expressed in Full-Time Equivalents.
CISD ranks third, at $384, among its peer districts in funds spent per student.
This amount is significantly lower than the state average expenditure per gifted and talented student.
CISD has three teachers with a gifted and talented certification teaching gifted and talented students.
Additionally, the district encourages its non-certified teachers to take gifted and talented courses as part of their staff development.
TEA does not report actual expenditure data for regional service centers.
FINDING
While CISD has made significant progress since a 1998 TEA District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) visit, some areas of weakness in their gifted and talented program still exist.
The 1998 DEC visit indicates that the district was not meeting all components of the State Plan regarding the gifted and talented education program.
Specifically, the DEC visit identified areas of weakness that include the process of selecting students and the array of learning opportunities available for gifted and talented students.
Since 1998, the district has continued to make improvements in the gifted and talented program.
The identification process is now documented, and the Gifted and Talented coordinator described how students are nominated and how they are assessed.
However, both the superintendent and counselor had concerns about the overall high number of gifted and talented students, but did say that this percentage was coming down due to better identification procedures.
One goal stated in the 2000-01 DIP is "to enhance the Gifted and Talented Program."
In CISD, gifted and talented elementary students are served through a pullout program, one hour per week.
This program began in 2000-01.
The high school principal said that the middle and high school students primarily are served in the regular classrooms, and are provided enrichment opportunities as available.
Some advanced placement courses are offered, and the principal said that the district would start a pre-AP class for 7^th grade students in 2001-02.
The high school offers a gifted and talented class, but the Spring 2001 schedule indicates that no students were enrolled in the class.
The high school principal said that with other courses and extracurricular activities, it is difficult to attract students to take the class.
The principal said that the district is in the process of improving the program's instructional approach in the middle and high schools.
High school students are served through advanced placement courses.
While the elementary program has made significant improvement in the gifted and talented program by implementing a pullout program and providing service to gifted students once a week, the middle and high school programs still need improvement.
The district does not have updated curriculum guides for any of the gifted and talented classes.
The coordinator, who also is an elementary and gifted and talented teacher, compiles teaching strategies and materials from the Internet and other sources.
The coordinator said that there is no regional cooperation regarding gifted and talented education and that increased communication with other schools in the area is needed.
CISD is a member of Region 15's Shared Services Agreement for Gifted and Talented Education.
In 2000-01, the district paid $1,981 for this membership.
As a member, the district has a written contract that specifies that the district should receive assistance with district and regional planning, assistance in program evaluation, assistance with identification of potential student participants and staff development.
The agreement also stipulated that Region 15 will assist the district in the development of a curriculum for the gifted and talented learner.
The contract further states that the service center is responsible for evaluating the program and for assisting in the creation and purchase of gifted and talented curriculum material.
With the exception of staff development provided by Region 15, the review team found no evidence that any of these contract stipulations have been met.
The superintendent, however, said that he was satisfied with the services received.
Region 15's Web site includes information helpful for program coordinators and has many links to sites that offer curriculum information for gifted and talented programs.
Several ESC regions have established cooperative relationships with neighboring districts.
Region 17 established an Advanced Academic Cooperative.
As a member, districts receive training, legal updates, demonstrations, on-site technical assistance, a resource library for gifted and talented education and advanced academics and become members of the regional gifted and talented advisory council.
Other services also are available.
Member districts pay a fee per student (with a total minimum of $500 and a maximum of $5,000 or $7,500, depending on services requested).
Region 5 has established an Advanced Academic Services Cooperative with area schools.
Other pilot projects in the state are combining technology and educational delivery for gifted and talented students as well.
As part of the Comptroller's e-Texas initiative, four school districts, Paris, Plainview, Pharr-San Juan-Alamo and Donna are participating in a pilot internet program designed to take advantage of the technology offered in the 21^st century that can open many learning opportunities for Texas' students.
The project is coordinated by the Comptroller's office with the help of The University of Texas' High School Distance Learning Center, the Texas Association for the Gifted and Talented, IBM and Cisco Systems.
IBM is providing laptop computers, a server and special software to each participating school district.
Cisco Systems will provide technical support to access the Internet.
Both companies have been successful nationally and internationally with education-related projects.
This initial pilot project specifically targets gifted and talented students.
Recommendation 13:
Fully implement the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.
Full implementation of the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students will result in a cohesive program that effectively addresses the concerns expressed by both parents and teachers.
This recommendation can be accomplished in a number of ways.
One approach is to develop the resources and approaches wholly within CISD.
By creating an internal taskforce of teachers and administrators, CISD can focus on achieving full implementation of the State Plan.
This five-member committee, which includes four teachers and one administrator, will be charged with developing a plan to fully implement the State Plan in CISD.
The district should continue the contracted agreement with Region 15, but also actively pursue a relationship with neighboring districts to create an Advanced Academics Cooperative.
Region 15 can participate in this cooperative after a review is made regarding the contract with Region 15 and the services that were provided to the district.
Through this cooperative, districts could share teachers, curriculum and other resources.
A summer exchange program would help gifted and talented teachers.
Because the development of a cooperative arrangement is more long-term, the bulk of the implementation strategies and fiscal estimates are based on an internal development.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The superintendent creates a district-level Advanced Academics advisory committee.
October 2001 2.
The Advanced Academics advisory committee conducts a needs assessment of the gifted and talented program.
The committee reviews CISD's current contract with Region 15 and makes recommendations regarding its effectiveness.
October - November 2001 3.
The committee determines the extent to which each school in the district is implementing the recommendations in the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students (State Plan.)
Fall 2001 4.
The Advanced Academics advisory committee develops a three-to-five year plan for achieving exemplary status as outlined in the State Plan and secures staff and board approval.
Ongoing 5.
The Advanced Academics committee develops measures to ensure that the district follows the State Plan and principals incorporate these measures into the campus improvement plans.
September 2002 6.
The superintendent takes the lead to approach neighboring districts to create an Advanced Academics Cooperative that would create the means to share teaching staff, services and expertise.
Region 15 can be part of this cooperative.
Ongoing 7.
The Advanced Academics advisory committee contacts other school districts with exemplary, cost-effective, gifted and talented programs and other Regions that have Advanced Academic Cooperatives.
Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation would have an annual cost of $2,200.
This amount includes a stipend of $250 for each of the four teachers on the committee.
An additional $1,200 is set aside to cover travel expenses and registration fees for one state conference per year.

Career and Technology Education
Texas Administrative Code (TAC) chapter 74 subchapter A requires school districts to offer career technology education courses selected from three of eight career and technology areas: agricultural science and technology, business, health science technology, home economics, technology/industrial technology, marketing, trade and industrial and career orientation.
This State Plan for Career and Technology Education 2000-2002, required under Texas Education Code (TEC) Ã¯Â¿Â½29.182, was developed as a guide to assist school districts in their efforts to offer effective career and technology education programs that prepare students for further education and eventual employment.
The plan is based on the premise that a rigorous academic foundation contributes to success in school and in life, that all students should be provided equal opportunities to succeed and that career and technology education should complement and enhance academic preparation by enabling students to apply academic principles to a variety of community and career situations.
Exhibit 2-20 presents thenumber and percentage of students enrolled in career and technology courses in CISD, its peer districts, Region 15 and the state.
