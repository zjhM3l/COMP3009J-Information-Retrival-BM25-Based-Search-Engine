Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project Oversight Coordination Commission Commission Summary Report September 2001 Contents Background The Oversight Coordination Commission Summary of Work Conclusion _________________________________________________________________ SUMMARY OF WORK OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Oversight activities of the Commission members' offices are summarized below.
[7]
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) engages in a broad array of CA/T Project-related activities, including criminal investigations, civil litigation, providing legal advice to the CA/T Project, and proposals for legislative action.
Oversight and enforcement efforts, often involving time consuming and resource intensive investigations, lead to prosecutions and financial recoveries, as well as providing an invaluable deterrent against crime.
Skillfully defending civil lawsuits on behalf of the CA/T Project offers a parallel deterrent, saving millions of dollars and guarding against meritless claims.
Throughout, dedicated funding from the Legislature has been crucial in allowing the OAG to further its multiple roles in connection with the CA/T Project.
Indeed, because of legislative funding, the OAG during the past year hired a new attorney as its CA/T Project Director.
The CA/T Project Director is responsible for coordinating and consolidating CA/T Project activities and litigation across the various bureaus of the OAG.
This responsibility includes facilitating the flow of information across OAG bureau lines, acting as an information hub on CA/T Project matters, and serving as a liaison between the OAG and state and federal agencies that have oversight and enforcement responsibilities on the CA/T Project.
Also during the past year, the OAG hired a private consulting firm to provide overall advice and guidance to the Attorney Generals management staff on case management, and detection and prevention of fraud and abuse on the CA/T Project.
The following sections summarize CA/T Project-related activities of the OAG that can be publicly reported.
Ongoing criminal investigations, with certain exceptions, are not reported.
Activities that were concluded previously are outlined in the September 2000 OCC Summary Report.
Fraud Hotline
The Attorney Generals Big Dig Fraud Hotline (1-888-TIP-BGDG or 1-888-847-2434), established in cooperation with the Commission members, periodically receives calls regarding potential fraud, waste, and abuse on the CA/T Project.
The toll-free Hotline is answered by OAG personnel during business hours and by voicemail at other times.
All calls to the Hotline are confidential.
In addition to past efforts to post the Hotline number at CA/T Project jobsites, and send it directly to CA/T Project staff, it is now posted on the Attorney Generals website, [22] the Commissions website, [23]
[24]
From June 1, 2000 through August 31, 2001, the Hotline logged 228 calls of all types.
The great majority of these calls concerned non-criminal matters, such as property damage from the construction, complaints about traffic patterns and job queries.
Calls that are better addressed by the CA/T Project itself, or by a different agency, are referred accordingly.
Criminal Enforcement
The Attorney General investigates and prosecutes individuals, contractors and corporations for criminal law violations on the CA/T Project.
The OAG receives referrals and allegations from diverse sources, and investigates these matters with the assistance of OAG internal investigators, Massachusetts State Police, and, in certain circumstances, the OSA, OIG, and/or federal agencies.
Allegations typically concern procurement fraud, larceny, false claims, criminal environmental violations, tax evasion, prevailing wage violations, and workers compensation fraud.
During the reporting period there have been and, in some instances, remain several ongoing CA/T Project criminal related investigations, which are summarized briefly below.
[25]
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Investigation of the CA/T Projects finances;
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Investigation of allegations of theft of CA/T Project materials;
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Investigation of allegations of illegal dumping of contaminated fill by a CA/T Project subcontractor;
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Investigation of alleged overbilling by a CA/T Project subcontractor;
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Investigation of allegations of bid rigging with respect to manufacturers of materials and supplies used in the construction of cable-stay bridge; and
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Investigation into allegation that a CA/T Project minority business enterprise is a sham.
One case resulting in an indictment is:
Commonwealth v. Yovette Mumford, Suffolk Superior No. SUCR2001-10446: On May 18, 2001, Yovette Mumford was indicted on seven counts of procurement fraud in violation of M.G.L.c. 266 Ã¯Â¿Â½67A, four counts of failure to account for and pay over-withholding tax in violation of M.G.L.c. 62C, Ã¯Â¿Â½73(b), and four counts of failure to file withholding tax returns in violation of M.G.L.c. 62C, Ã¯Â¿Â½73(c).
All counts relate to the ownership and operation by Ms. Mumford of American Electronics Corporation (AEC), an electrical inspection subcontracting firm on the CA/T Project.
The case is pending.
Business and Labor Protection Bureau
The Business and Labor Protection Bureau performs several functions related to the CA/T Project.
The Fair Labor and Business Practices Division (FLBP) enforces laws relating to wage and overtime violations in construction related industries.
During the reporting period, FLBP carried out these responsibilities through investigating complaints of unlawful conduct, advising CA/T Project staff of allegations of improper activity for its review, and communicating with industry and labor organizations in connection with the formation and articulation of law enforcement policy.
In particular, FLBP staff was involved in the following CA/T Project related activities:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Investigation of complaints of failure to pay prevailing wage and overtime to, and mis-classification of, CA/T Project workers;
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Investigation of a CA/T Project contractor alleged to have failed to forward pension fund deductions to the union plan;
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Meetings with CA/T Project staff, Division of Occupational Safety administrators, and industry and labor groups concerning the applicability of the prevailing wage law to the transportation of bituminous and ready-mix concrete, and gravel and fill; and
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Meetings with CA/T Project staff and Teamsters Union leadership concerning the impact of collective bargaining agreement provisions on prevailing wage enforcement.
FLBP expects to continue to monitor workplace activities on the CA/T Project and, when necessary, to investigate and prosecute improper conduct.
The Insurance and Unemployment Fraud Division (IUFD) investigates and prosecutes cases of employer workers compensation, insurance fraud, employers who fail to contribute to the unemployment fund, and employees who make fraudulent claims.
IUFD members participate in the Insurance Fraud Task Force.
The Insurance Fraud Task Force is comprised of representatives from the CA/T Project, the Insurance Fraud Bureau of Massachusetts, the Suffolk County District Attorneys Office and the OAG.
The goal of the Insurance Fraud Task Force is to develop and implement new programs to help prevent and/or detect the filing of fraudulent workers compensation claims.
Civil Litigation
The Attorney General exercises civil litigation responsibilities regarding the CA/T Project in several areas.
The OAG affirmatively pursues environmental enforcement actions, and proposes systematic approaches to deter fraud and other problems that may arise on the CA/T Project.
The Attorney General also defends the Commonwealth in a variety of contract, eminent domain, environmental, and other civil matters, avoiding disruptions to the CA/T Project and saving hundreds of millions of dollars to date.
When called upon by the CA/T Project, the Office also may pursue civil cost recovery actions against those who are not entitled to CA/T Project funds that they have claimed or received.
The Attorney General determines his position in each CA/T Project litigation matter, as in all other areas, through an examination of the facts, the law, and the public interest.
In some particular cases, the Attorney General may take a position that is adverse to that of the MHD or another state agency.
In such cases, the agency may retain private counsel.
Specific civil litigation matters that were active or pending during the past year included the following:
Contaminated Waste: The Attorney General sought injunctive relief against a demolition contractor who provided the CA/T Project with contaminated fill.
The case was settled with judgment entered against the demolition contractor, which required the demolition contractor to conduct cleanup activities and pay a civil penalty of $90,000.
(Attorney General v. MRP Site Development, Inc., Suffolk Superior No. 99-3841-C.)
Environmental Cost Recovery: The Attorney General, representing MHD, brought an environmental cost recovery action with respect to the cleanup of property adjacent to Logan Airport.
The action is based upon an agreement, executed in July 1993 after the property was taken by eminent domain, under which the owner was to indemnify MHD for certain environmental matters.
The Superior Court initially granted summary judgment on behalf of the property owner and against MHD.
After MHD appealed, the Appeals Court reversed, allowing MHD to continue pursuing the matter.
(MHD v. Smith, Suffolk Superior No. 96-7171E, Appeals Court No. 99-P-0001.)
Quarry Hills: The Attorney General has defended state agencies, most frequently the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in fifteen actions brought by an automobile dealership and other individuals to challenge administrative permitting decisions relating to the use of CA/T Project soils to cap and close two municipal landfills and an illegal dumping ground owned by the Metropolitan District Commission.
The project site is being developed into a public golf course and recreational complex with a number of playing fields.
The Attorney General is currently defending DEP in eleven pending actions.
(Quirk, et al. v. DEP, et al.)
Direct Payment: The Attorney General is defending MHD in an action brought by a steelwork company that participated in the construction of egress ramps at Logan Airport.
The company, which performed this work pursuant to a contract with the original subcontractor, claims entitlement to direct payment from MHD.
Following completion of discovery, the Commonwealths motion for summary judgment was granted.
The plaintiff has appealed.
(Maza Construction Systems International, Inc. v. Bedingfield, Suffolk Superior No. 96-2665B.)
Truckers Fringe Benefit Deductions: The Attorney General represented MHD and other Commonwealth defendants in an action brought by certain non-union truckers challenging the CA/T Project requirement that contractors make contributions on behalf of truckers to the union health and welfare and pension funds, and seeking cash payments in lieu of those contributions.
The court granted the Commonwealth defendants motion to dismiss.
The case continues as to other parties.
An appeal, if any, of the Courts dismissal of the Commonwealth defendants must await a resolution of the balance of the litigation.
(New England Independent Truckers Assoc. v. Intl Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 379, U.S.D.C.
No. 98-10287-RCL.)
Damage to Business: The OAG is defending MHD in a nuisance negligence and trespass claim brought by a business which abuts the CA/T Project.
The plaintiff claims that the loss of access to the business, excessive vibration, dust and physical disturbances have caused both physical damage and business loss.
The case is in discovery.
(Casablanca Salon, Inc. v. Massachusetts Highway Department, Suffolk Superior Court No. 00-4585F.)
Eminent Domain: The Attorney General has defended the Commonwealth in numerous actions brought by property owners for additional compensation after their properties were taken by eminent domain for the CA/T Project.
In a typical eminent domain matter, the property owner is awarded a dollar amount (the pro tanto award) determined by the state agency through appraisals, which are intended to take into account factors including the location and environmental condition of the property and the nature of the taking (e.g., temporary easement).
If the owner seeks additional compensation, the owner may file a civil action against the Commonwealth.
By defending the Commonwealth against inflated compensation claims in CA/T Project matters, the Attorney General has saved the CA/T Project more than $4 million during the past year, and more than $150 million to date.
(Independent Wholesale Florists and Suppliers Realty Trust v. Commonwealth, Suffolk Superior No. 97-00964E; Linde v. Commonwealth, Suffolk Superior No. 98-1000C; McKinley Square Condominium Assoc. v. Commonwealth, Suffolk Superior No. 98-4569H; New England Seafood Center Associates v. Commonwealth, Suffolk Superior No. 97-4211; Sullivan v. Commonwealth, Suffolk Superior No. 97-1011.)
In addition to three substantial eminent domain matters profiled separately below, a number of other eminent domain actions relating to the CA/T Project are pending.
(B
a.
Frontage Development Corp. v. Commonwealth, Suffolk Superior No. 98-0630E: In this matter, the property owners sought $10 million.
The pro tanto was $467,000.
The case was tried and the jury returned a verdict of $795,350.
If the verdict is upheld on appeal, this will result in a savings of more than $9 million for the Commonwealth.
b. Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital: In March 1998, the Attorney General won a significant decision against Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, which had claimed that the CA/T Project was obligated contractually to take the hospital by eminent domain and pay for its relocation.
The decision, which followed a 44-day trial, saved the CA/T Project and taxpayers as much as $100 million.
The Hospital has filed an appeal and settlement negotiations are continuing.
The Hospital subsequently filed a second eminent domain suit, seeking damages from several permanent and temporary easements taken by the Commonwealth for the CA/T Project.
Also, on July 31, 2000 the Legislature passed Bill Number MA99RSB 2272, An Act For An Accelerated Improvement Program For The Commonwealth.
Section 96 provides that the Commissioner of the Division of Capital Asset Management (DCAM) may convey the property at 100 Nashua Street and adjacent property to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Corp. as part of a settlement of Spauldings land damage, relocation, and mitigation claims against the Commonwealth.
The transfer may occur after (1) DCAM determines the fair market value of the property through an appraisal which must be reviewed and approved by the Inspector General, and (2) the Secretary of Administration and Finance, after review of the appraisal and comments of the Commissioner of DCAM and the Attorney General, makes written findings that it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth to convey the property.
These cases are pending.
(Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Corp. v. Commonwealth, Suffolk Superior No. 95-4360 C; The Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Corp. v. Commonwealth, No. 99-5733E.)
c. Dewey Square Tower Associates: Pursuant to its eminent domain powers, the CA/T Project took temporary and permanent easements on the property at One Financial Center.
The owner has brought an action seeking additional compensation beyond the pro tanto award.
As part of those damages, the owner seeks damages for the diminution in value to the property as a whole.
The owners demand is for $14 million.
The Commonwealth has filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on a substantial portion of the damages claimed by the owner.
Argument on this motion is scheduled for November.
(Dewey Square Tower Associates v. Commonwealth, Suffolk Superior No. 97-6133G.)
Mass Transit Mitigation.
In 1998, the Attorney General sued the Executive Office of Transportation and Construction and MHD under the Massachusetts Clean Air Act for allegedly failing to comply with certain DEP requirements relating to mass transit improvements related to the CA/T Project.
This suit led to the CA/T Projects requesting the DEP to modify its underlying regulatory obligations in order to cure the current noncompliance.
DEP issued a final decision on the CA/T Projects request modifying the CA/T Projects obligations in various respects, e.g. allowing substitute projects and adjusting the timing of certain obligations.
DEP also entered into an administrative consent order regarding the revised obligations.
A Stipulation of Dismissal was entered in the case.
(Attorney General v. Executive Office of Transportation and Construction, et al., Suffolk Superior No. 98-4839-E.)
Construction Contract Claims:
a.
M. DeMatteo Construction Co. et al. v. Massachusetts Highway Department, et al., Suffolk Superior No. 01-2496B: The OAG is defending an approximately $12 million claim for extra costs brought by the contractor for the construction of the Interstate-90 South Boston Interchange West portion of the CA/T Project.
The contractor claims to have incurred the costs when the support for an excavation gave way, resulting in a landslide.
The contracts Dispute Review Board decided that the contractor was entitled to $6.1 million in extra costs.
b. Commonwealth v. Perini Corp., Kiewet Construction Co., Inc., Jay Cashman, Inc. d/b/a/ Perini-Kiewet-Cashman Joint Venture (PKC): This is a very complicated matter arising out of the C11A1 contract on the CA/T Project.
As a result of hundreds of change order claims, PKC seeks over $150 million from the CA/T Project.
Numerous disputes arose between the CA/T Project and PKC concerning the payment of these change order claims, resulting in the submission of these disputes to a Dispute Review Board (DRB).
After the DRB issued a series of decisions and awards on some of the claims, PKC exercised its contractual option to dissolve the first DRB and convene a second DRB with new members.
The second DRB has also issued a series of decisions and awards on some of the claims.
Each party has filed actions in Superior Court seeking to affirm or vacate some of the decisions and awards made by each DRB, or challenging procedural aspects of the DRB proceedings.
There are a significant number of claims still pending before the DRB and the Superior Court cases are pending.
c. FAMM, Inc. v. Peabody Construction Co. v. Commonwealth, Middlesex Superior No. 96-0431E: The Attorney General is defending the Commonwealth in a case brought by a CA/T Project subcontractor, through the contractor, alleging that it is entitled to nearly $1 million in additional compensation because it was required to perform additional work, beyond that required by the contract specifications, in the fabrication of steel for a CA/T Project maintenance facility in South Boston.
After completion of discovery, the Superior Court entered summary judgment for MHD.
If this decision is upheld after an anticipated appeal, this will result in a savings of nearly $1 million for the CA/T Project.
Legislation
False Claims Act.
In July, 2000, the Legislature passed a new state False Claims Act with the active support of the Attorney General.
The new state False Claims Act is modeled upon the highly successful federal False Claims Act, which has enabled the federal government to recover millions of dollars from corporations and individuals that submit false claims and false statements for federal funds.
The Attorney General anticipates that the new state False Claims Act will significantly enhance the Commonwealth's ability to uncover fraud and recover state funds on CA/T Project contracts.
The new state False Claims Act is designed to generate investigative leads by providing that individuals who come forward with information may share in the Commonwealth's recovery in certain instances.
It is anticipated that this incentive will encourage whistleblowers to come forward with information.
Specifically, the Act authorizes the Attorney General to file a civil action to recover treble damages, costs of investigation and attorney's fees from those who are found to have submitted false claims or false statements in support of claims for state funds.
The statute provides specific protections to employee whistleblowers against adverse employment actions.
The statute also enables the Attorney General to compel the production of documents and testimony while a case is in the investigative stage.
Employee whistleblowers, known as "relators," may also file suit.
The suit is initially filed under seal for a period of time during which the Attorney General can decide whether to pursue the case on behalf of the Commonwealth.
Whether or not the Attorney General decides to file suit in a particular case, the whistleblower allegations may yield significant new information for investigations and recommendations by the State Auditor and Inspector General.
OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR [26]
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Internal FHWA records showed that in 1995, B/PB officials disclosed to local FHWA officials all budget assumptions that Big Dig officials had used to shrink the Big Dig cost estimate from $14 billion to $8 billion.
Records revealed that local FHWA officials acted in partnership with state officials to downsize the Big Dig cost estimate for public relations purposes.
In early 2000, federal officials investigated the cause of the Big Dig cost overrun; they concluded that state officials had deceived local FHWA officials.
FHWA records contradicted this conclusion.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Big Dig and local FHWA officials shirked their fiduciary responsibilities by not disclosing all relevant financial facts to the public, the State Legislature, or -as required by law- the bond markets.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Governor, the Chairman of the Turnpike Authority, and the Commonwealths Secretary of Transportation and Construction failed to fulfill their responsibility to implement the reporting requirements of M.G.L. c. 3, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 17 of the Acts of 1997.
The Legislature required semi-annual Big Dig Finance reports that disclosed the true nature of CA/T Project costs and CA/T Project finances.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Big Dig files were reportedly missing, computer hard drives had allegedly been destroyed, and many documents continued to be shielded from the public by attorney-client privilege.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Office of the State Treasurer ultimately forced Big Dig officials to disclose the cost overrun through its due diligence review of February 2000.
[T]his Office concludes that the current Governor and his appointees have not disclosed the real Big Dig budget story to federal investigators, Congress, the State Treasurer, and the State Legislature.
IG report, March 2001
The OIGs report called for an independent federal investigation by Congress into the FHWAs role in downsizing the Big Dig cost estimate and for a re-examination of the FHWA-imposed funding cap that has harmed the citizens of Massachusetts by saddling them with billions of dollars in added debt.
As a result of the OIGs report, the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation signed a letter to the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Transportation requesting that there be an investigation into the allegations contained in the report.
Senator John McCain and Congressman Harold Rogers also sent letters to the U.S. Department of Transportation requesting that an investigation be undertaken.
The Joint Committee on Transportation of the Massachusetts Legislature called for a hearing into the matter.
At this hearing, B/PBs Big Dig Manager confirmed that the Governor was told in 1994 of the $14 billion cost projection and he also stated that he told the former CA/T Project Director that he was concerned that information should flow higher than [the Director].
The Massachusetts Attorney General also began an investigation and has issued numerous subpoenas.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing its investigation and has issued subpoenas as well.
The DOTIG and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have also initiated investigations.
None of the parties referred to in the report have offered official denials of any of the specific allegations.
In a press release issued the day after the OIG released the report, B/PB stated:
The report confirms that, in accordance with its contracts, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB) provided its clients, the Massachusetts Highway Department and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with complete, timely and accurate information about the actual and estimated cost of completing the CA/T Project.
Under those contracts and state law, B/PB fulfilled all of its reporting obligations.
The report also confirms that other state and federal officials were simultaneously aware of this information.
Beyond satisfying its contractual requirements, B/PB has met or exceeded all standards of professional practice regarding cost control and reporting.
Cost Recovery Program Review
In December 2000, the OIG issued a report entitled A Review of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project Cost Recovery Program.
In general, cost recovery is the process by which owners file claims against design and construction management professionals for the costs claimed to be attributable to errors, omissions, or other unsatisfactory performance.
This report assessed whether the CA/T Project had developed an independent and viable program, whether staff adhered to procedures, and whether the CA/T Project pursued objectives in a prudent, well-documented, and timely manner.
The review yielded the following specific findings:
In six years, the CA/T Project had only recovered $30,000 from about $83.5 million in cost recovery related change orders.
The CA/T Project set up the cost recovery program primarily to ensure federal funding, not to recover costs.
B/PBs overly broad role in CA/T Project management undermined the Commonwealths ability to hold B/PB accountable for its design work.
The CA/T Project failed to pursue cost recovery against B/PB.
Changes to the cost recovery procedure reflected the CA/T Projects increased reliance on B/PB, while internal organizational relationships impeded Turnpike Authoritys ability to hold B/PB accountable for its performance.
Moreover, B/PBs conflicting interests in the cost recovery program served as yet another example of the vulnerabilities of the current contractual arrangement.
CA/T Project management directed B/PB to subcontract for the services of the consultant responsible for assessing B/PBs potential liability for cost overruns.
The cost recovery program showed serious signs of neglect.
On average, CA/T Project staff took more than a year (394 days) to close cost recovery cases.
CA/T Project staff lost or misplaced much cost recovery files.
The CA/T Project did not, under the cost recovery program, actively pursue alternative methods of cost recovery.
CA/T Project managers limited the cost recovery program to design-related issues.
Many of the cost recovery files were incomplete.
The CA/T Project did not adequately document cost recovery cases.
The unsigned and undated closing memoranda contained references to information that was not in the records in the file.
The CA/T Projects closing memoranda did not accurately document the review process or adequately document the cost recovery committees rationale for recommending no further action.
The cost recovery procedure examined during this review did not mandate the use of stated criteria nor did it provide adequate guidance for identifying and pursuing cost recovery actions.
The cost recovery program failed to provide guidelines or training to staff members, including resident engineers, who were closest to the issues.
The cost recovery procedures did not adequately describe the responsibilities and objectives of the cost recovery committee.
The committee could revise the procedures without written justification.
In some cases, the CA/T Project failed to assess accurately the full cost impact of deficient design work.
CA/T Project management eliminated an effective method for catching potential cost recovery actions that B/PB may have missed.
The structure of the program provides no assurance that deficient performance will be detected and no evidence that costs incurred as a result of deficient designer performance would be pursued through the cost recovery program, even if the problem had been detected.
In the context of the $14+ billion CA/T Project, the $30,000 recovered so far barely registers as a token nod to recovering costs.
IG report, December 2000
The OIG recommended that the CA/T Project take the following corrective actions:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Revisit the earlier decision not to regard the cost recovery program as an opportunity to cut costs or reduce the net cost to taxpayers.
Based on results, designers including B/PB have no reason to believe that they will be held accountable through cost recovery action for their mistakes.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use the cost recovery program to send a clear message that all design professionals on the CA/T Project will be held accountable for their design work.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Reassess the basis for determining whether to pursue a cost recovery case.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Avoid conflicts of interest by ensuring that the Turnpike Authority or MHD, not B/PB, contracts directly for any services aimed at assessing B/PBs liability for design deficiencies.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Delink B/PB and Turnpike Authority organizations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Define clearly and follow through on the purpose and processes of the cost recovery program procedures.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide training and guidelines to increase the likelihood that those closest to the issues in the field, including resident engineers, identify cost increases caused by deficient design.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Explore and vigorously pursue cost recovery opportunities that go beyond the current program boundaries, including recovery actions for construction management issues and indirect cost overpayments to consultants.
CA/T Project management concurred with many of the report findings concerning program neglect and inadequate documentation.
Notwithstanding CA/T Project managements strenuous objections to many other findings and conclusions, the OIG was pleased to note evidence of steps taken to remedy the problems documented in the report.
Bid Law Compliance
In a June 2000 letter, the OIG cautioned CA/T Project management against reducing the scope from future Charles River Basin construction contracts after the completion of the bidding process.
The CA/T Project considered reducing the scope of the contracts after awarding them to be a cost-savings measure.
The OIG has consistently taken the position that what goes out to bid should reflect the final scope of work on the project to the extent possible.
Moreover, the Massachusetts public bidding laws prohibit omitting portions of the scope of work after the bids are opened, even if it is done to reduce costs.
At the CA/T Projects request, the OIG addressed the use of M.G.L. c. 149 alternates on M.G.L. c. 30 contracts.29 The OIG wrote that M.G.L. c. 30, Ã¯Â¿Â½39M bidders may use alternates, but must follow the rules that govern the use of alternates by their M.G.L. c. 149, Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½44A-44J counterparts.
Use of alternates would require that the CA/T Project list the alternates numerically in order of priority, and then consider each in the same numerical order.
In closing, the OIG urged the CA/T Project to confer with its own legal staff and the OAG, if necessary, to determine how to proceed in the particular situation.
The CA/T Project responded that all contracts would comply with bid law requirements, including any use of alternates.
The CA/T Project informed the OIG that it was considering M.G.L. c. 149 alternates on one or more of the Charles River Basin Parks contracts, which would soon be ready to bid under M.G.L. c. 30, Ã¯Â¿Â½39M.
LEGISLATIVE ISSUES
Legislatively Mandated Reviews
Under Section 56 of Chapter 235 of the Acts of 2000, no construction or contractual agreement for construction shall begin prior to the review and approval of the Inspector General[,] if the construction is to be in connection with the ventilation buildings, utility facilities, and toll booths that are part of the CA/T Project.
Since 1994, similar language has mandated these reviews, although the Inspector Generals approval before construction could begin was not required until 1996.
The OIG initiates the review once the CA/T Project provides notification that the CA/T Project plans to advertise for bids for a specific contract.
The OIG then performs a preliminary review of the contract, in most cases before the CA/T Project advertises the contract.
The OIG completes the review after monitoring the bid process and any design or specification changes that occur during the process.
Final review results are provided in writing to the CA/T Project leadership, the Legislature and others as appropriate.
Dewey Square Air Intake Structure
The OIG completed a review of documents related to the $10.9 million Dewey Square Air Intake Structure, a planned three-story building that will provide fresh air supply for the depressed artery.
The contract includes the building construction, supports for two ventilation fans, exterior site improvements, temporary street lighting, and maintaining the realigned Atlantic Avenue Bypass Roadway.
The OIG identified a number of concerns regarding cost, compliance, and planning.
The problems disclosed by the OIGs review did not merit withholding approval for the contract to proceed into construction and the Inspector General granted approval in May 2001.
Nevertheless, the OIG urged CA/T Project officials to address a number of troubling issues the OIG identified as a result of this and previous reviews.
The OIG warned that if the CA/T Project persists in failing to adequately address these and related issues, the OIG would consider withholding future approvals:
Third-party changes/Architectural features.
The Commonwealth assumed the financial risk of future joint development by paying an estimated $300,000 to design a architectural feature (curved vault roof) that was included in the contract to conform with the needs of a specific joint development partner who may not be able to participate due to lack of funding.
The OIG expressed concern about the inclusion of architectural features to support plans for future development by third parties that may never materialize and recommended that CA/T Project management examine and control carefully the cost of design features for joint-development purposes to ensure that public funds are not wasted.
Life-cycle cost analysis.
The OIGs review disclosed no evidence that the CA/T Project completed a formal life-cycle cost analysis.
Properly conducted life-cycle cost analyses identify all costs for acquisition, construction, operations, and maintenance of a facility for its useful life.
Knowing potential operations and maintenance costs also allows the operator to assess and plan for financing these future expenses.
The OIG recommended that CA/T Project staff prepare information pertaining to these costs and provide it to the Turnpike Authority staff charged with managing CA/T Project-related functions and financing.
Contract drawings.
The OIG reiterated its opinion that the CA/T Project had not complied with the requirements of the Massachusetts Board of Registration for professional engineers for reviewing and approving contract drawings.
The OIG also identified errors and inconsistencies in the drawings and urged the CA/T Project to correct the problems.
Construction interface/Access restraints.
The OIG expressed concern about the potential for added costs due to contract interface and site access restraints, in part because connecting the air intake structure would be performed under a different contract.
The CA/T Project has incurred additional costs due to coordination problems in the past.
The OIG noted that prudent action by the CA/T Project, such as efficient site coordination and construction sequencing, would prevent costly delay claims and reduce the risk of change orders caused by additional mobilization and other delay-related costs incurred by the contractor.
Claims avoidance review.
As a result of the OIGs inquiry, CA/T Project staff purport to have completed this type of review, which aims to mitigate changes and disputes arising from complex design and construction contract interdependencies.
Aggressive cost control should include claims avoidance reviews before bids are opened, not afterwards as occurred on this contract.
The OIG also noted that the CA/T Project had not provided documents to the OIG in a timely manner and had not yet complied with certain notification requirements under M.G.L. c. 149.
In its June 2001 letter of response, CA/T Project management acknowledged that not all documents were provided in a timely manner and indicated that the matter would be remedied for future requests.
Although the CA/T Project Director took issue with several of the findings, he noted that staff agreed to correct certain design package errors, concurred with the need for site coordination, and would make the changes necessary to ensure compliance with the public bid laws.
LEGISLATIVE REVIEWS AND TESTIMONY
The OIG is obligated under its enabling statute, M.G.L. c. 12A, to review all legislation filed in each legislative session.
When appropriate, the Inspector General comments in written and oral testimony to the Legislature and the Governor on proposed legislation; often, the Inspector General recommends specific amendments to bills.
In the 2000 and 2001 sessions, the OIG commented on hundreds of pieces of legislation.
This section highlights OIG testimony on CA/T Project-related issues.
Written Testimony to the Members of the Joint Committee on Transportation
In an April 2001 letter to the legislative Joint Committee on Transportation, the Inspector General supplemented his oral testimony on CA/T Project finance issues (see summary of OIG report beginning on page 32.
The Inspector General noted that although the OIG finance report was without doubt the most extensive CA/T Project finance-related review the OIG had conducted, it was by no means the first time the OIG had raised finance, accountability, and cost-related concerns.
The Inspector General reminded the Committee that the OIG had issued 14 reports, conducted 11 statutorily mandated reviews of CA/T Project building contracts, completed 22 technical assistance reviews at the request of CA/T Project officials, and sent scores of letters to the Legislature and other public officials.
The OIG has made in excess of 400 recommendations aimed at containing costs, increasing public accountability, and reducing vulnerability to waste and abuse.
The Inspector General warned the Committee, as the OIG had warned legislative and CA/T Project leaders many times before, about the vulnerabilities of the contractual arrangement between the Commonwealth and B/PB, the joint venture hired in 198530 to manage design and construction of the CA/T Project.
In the late nineties, public officials reorganized the CA/T Project management structure.
This new so-called integrated project organization (IPO), rendered the CA/T Project vulnerable to divided loyalties, conflicting interests, and further undermined public officials ability to hold B/PB accountable for bringing the CA/T Project in on time and within budget.
According to CA/T Project managers, the IPO was designed to match staff members technical skills to jobs without regard to the organization paying their salaries.
The resulting organizational scheme has the potential to be an accountability nightmare.
For example, the Turnpike Authoritys Director of Construction reports both to B/PBs top program manager and to the Turnpike Authoritys Project Director.
This individual (the Turnpike Authoritys Director of Construction) has represented the Turnpike Authority in contract negotiations with B/PB, even though he reports to B/PB managers.
In written testimony, the Inspector General also reiterated his earlier concern about the enormous power granted to the Turnpike Authority when the Metropolitan Highway System was created in 1997 (M.G.L. c. 81A).
He urged state leaders to retain control concerning the CA/T Project in order to insure the publics representation in decisions about who will pay how much of the spiraling CA/T Project price tag.
Written Testimony to the Legislative Commission on Surface Artery Restoration
In June 2001, the OIG conveyed to the Legislative Commission on Surface Artery Restoration (Legislative Commission) concerns about air rights development on the Central Artery Corridor, an area that the Legislative Commission was charged with reviewing under paragraph 8 of St. 2000, c. 87, Ã¯Â¿Â½20.
For many years, the CA/T Project finance plans contained a credit of hundreds of millions of dollars for anticipated revenue from leasing air rights to private developers.
However, the law does not require the Turnpike Authority to conduct an open, fair, and competitive process when it selects private developers for the air rights above the Central Artery Corridor.
While not disputing the Turnpike Authoritys rights in air space over land that it owns, the OIG argued that the public interest should be adequately safeguarded in any disposition process.
The revenues generated from leasing air rights will likely be significant.
CA/T Project officials and the Legislature are counting on it.
The OIG observed that the public deserved a fair deal and a good deal when the Turnpike Authority leases these valuable assets to private developers.
The OIG urged the Legislative Commission, as it prepares its report and proposes legislation, to require a fair, open, and competitive process for the disposition of air rights in the Central Artery Corridor, as well as the Central Artery North Area and the Ted Williams Tunnel.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Central Artery/Tunnel Project: Management Issues and Recommendations
In December 2000 the OIG issued a report containing correspondence regarding management issues and recommendations in 22 technical assistance reviews conducted by the OIG since 1993 at the request of CA/T Project officials.
These reviews examined complex design and construction management problems, commented on procurement processes, and clarified legal compliance requirements.
Regardless of the topic, the purpose of the reviews has been to identify systemic vulnerabilities to waste and abuse, point out opportunities for savings and cost control, and assist CA/T Project leaders to better oversee and manage their own operations.
IG report, December 2000
Throughout the 22 reviews undertaken at the CA/T Projects request, the OIG has consistently offered advice and urged the actions summarized in the list below:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop the internal organizational capacity to monitor and control costs on management consultant, design, and construction contracts.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Define performance standards and work products to be delivered under contract; hold vendors accountable for performance, including cost and schedule.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Guard against conflicts of interest and the appearance of impropriety in the hiring of staff and the assignment of functions among employees and private consultant staff.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Avoid sole source procurements, which may increase CA/T Project costs and unfairly favor one vendor over others.
Justify any sole source procurement in writing and obtain the requisite review and approval.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop clear CA/T Project procedures and guidelines.
Ensure compliance with all applicable statutory requirements, procedures, guidelines, and management mandates.
Failure to comply with key directives can increase the Commonwealths vulnerability to cost overruns and future litigation.
The OIG noted that, based on the written responses to the reviews documented in this report, the CA/T Projects track record for decisive action on technical assistance recommendations had been mixed.
CA/T Project management had been most responsive to the OIGs recommendations concerning ways to improve proposed systems for procuring management consultant and design-related services.
Prevailing Wage Compliance
In a July 2000 letter to the CA/T Project, the OIG responded to the CA/T Projects earlier request for technical assistance by reviewing a report prepared by a CA/T Project consultant regarding prevailing wage compliance by a CA/T Project trucking subcontractor.
The CA/T Project hired a consultant (an accounting firm under contract with MHD) to review an allegation that a subcontractor had failed to pay prevailing wages.
The CA/T Project requested that the OIG review the consultants report and comment on whether the consultant appeared to have adequately addressed the issue.
The OIG concluded that while review of the allegations should have been referred to the OAG rather than an accounting firm, the consultant had adequately addressed the concern of CA/T Project staff, given the scope of the review and the fact that it was a review and not an audit.
The OIG also recommended that the CA/T Project:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conduct a follow-up review of those truckers from whom the consultant could not obtain satisfactory answers or contact.
Use a larger sample of truckers and conduct periodic reviews of this sort.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Review internal procedures to ensure that non-compliance can be detected.
Evaluate the effectiveness of the compliance unit.
Conduct quality assurance/quality control audits of the compliance unit.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Forward all allegations and violations related to prevailing wages to the OAG.
In light of past prevailing wage violations and the recent investigations into allegations of extortion, excessive overtime, and theft on the C12A3 I-93 Massachusetts Avenue Interchange construction contract, CA/T Project management should consider an internal reassessment of how it handles its obligations under the law.
OIG letter to CA/T Project Acting Director, July 2000
The CA/T Project responded in a November 2000 letter stating that CA/T Project staff regularly reviewed records and interviewed workers to ensure compliance.
The CA/T Project noted that it would continue to review its procedures to ensure that compliance mechanisms are accurate.
The CA/T Project also stated that it had made at least 25 referrals regarding prevailing wage issues to the OAG.
Request for Qualifications and Proposal (RFQ/P) for Audit Services on CA/T Professional Services Contracts
In January 2001, CA/T Project staff requested the OIGs assistance in developing an RFQ/P for selecting certified public accountant firms to perform federally required audits on millions of dollars in consulting contracts on the CA/T Project.
The request emanated, in part, from the OIGs earlier criticism of the flawed process for procuring audit services and the troubling backlog of audit work.
The OIG had urged CA/T Project management to ensure the organizational independence of the audit function and to aggressively pursue recovery of overpayments to consultants.
During February 2001, CA/T Project managers provided a rough draft of the RFQ/P to the OIG and briefed OIG staff on their concerns and objectives in procuring professional audit services.
CA/T Project staff invited input to help ensure that the RFQ/P appropriately articulated the services required and established a fair and justifiable ranking system.
A subsequent draft reflected the CA/T Projects efforts to incorporate the OIGs recommendations.
For example, it required respondents to submit all questions in writing, and required that the proposed project manager and key personnel play a major role at the interviews.
In April 2001, the CA/T Project provided a newly revised draft of the RFQ/P and requested additional assistance in ensuring that the scope and evaluation criteria are appropriate, fair, complete, and clear.
In response, the OIG provided more than two dozen suggestions, including more rigorous qualification and experience requirements, provisions for bimonthly status reports, and evidence to demonstrate a history of meeting high performance standards.
The OIG indicated its willingness to provide additional assistance as needed.

OSA ISSUED REPORTS
Inadequate Management Controls over the Contractual Documentation Relating to the Wrap-Up Insurance Program
During our examination of the CA/T Project wrap-up insurance program, we found that although standard annual policies guaranteeing insurance coverage have been executed, contractual agreements covering major provisions of the wrap-up insurance programs workers compensation and general liability insurances had not been signed for lengthy periods of time or had never been signed at all, contrary to sound management practices.
Wrap-up insurance programs, also referred to as Owner Controlled Insurance Programs (OCIPs), are created by contract between the insured and an insurance carrier.
The contract (agreement) contains significant clauses that augment or supersede provisions of the annual standard insurance policy that provides insurance coverage.
American International Group, Inc.
(AIG) provides the workers compensation and general liability insurances for the CA/T Project.
The CA/T Projects June 16, 2000 Finance Plan Update estimated that the CA/T Projects total cash requirement for insurance will amount to $575 million, of which $503 million, or 87%, represents workers compensation and general liability insurance premium payments.
Our audit revealed that, other than the standard annual policies guaranteeing insurance coverage, contractual agreements covering major provisions of the OCIPs workers compensation and general liability insurances had not been signed for lengthy periods of time or had never been signed at all.
In fact, the only signed agreement involving either insurance was one covering workers compensation for the three-year period November 1992 through October 1995.
Even in this instance, the agreement was not signed until four months after the expiration of the three-year period of insurance coverage, or more than three years after the effective date of insurance coverage.
According to CA/T Project officials, the workers compensation insurance agreements in subsequent years and the general liability insurance agreements are unsigned drafts.
Clearly, operating a multimillion-dollar program without signed agreements is contradictory to sound business practices and is an example of the existence of inadequate internal controls and oversight by management.
The OSA also found that the CA/T Project obtained risk management advisory services without having a signed subcontract with the vendor.
Willis Corroon Corporation, an international insurance broker and advisor, was hired by the CA/T Project to review the February 2000 CA/T Project Risk Management Report.
Willis Corroon reviewed and endorsed the CA/T Projects risk management plan, which was included in the March 15, 2000 CA/T Project Finance Plan.
A review of the procurement groups files, sought to obtain relating to this particular subcontract showed that the CA/T Project procurement officials, beginning in June 1999 sought to obtain information to formalize the subcontract.
However, as of August 22, 2000, the subcontract had not been signed for this completed work.
Officials from the CA/T Projects procurement group stated that no payment would be made until a signed agreement has been received.
The OSA recommended that the CA/T Project should operate its workers compensation and general liability insurance programs under signed agreements that cover all aspects of these insurance programs.
Accordingly, CA/T Project officials should review and strengthen their management controls over the timely formalization of all CA/T Project contractual documentation.
North/South Rail Link
The metropolitan Boston area is served by a local and regional passenger rail service that is divided into two separate and independent rail systems, one terminating at North Station and the other terminating at South Station.
North Station is the terminus for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's (MBTA) local commuter rail service to the north and northwest of Boston as well as Amtrak's proposed regional rail service between Boston and Portland, Maine.
South Station is the terminus for the MBTA's local commuter rail service to the south and west of Boston and of all Amtrak's current service to Boston.
The two stations are approximately one mile apart and there is no direct link connecting the two stations.
The North/South Rail Link (NSRL) is a proposed railroad connection between North and South Stations under the new Central Artery alignment in Boston.
The State Auditor issued a report on the above project, which identified the following two deficiencies:
1.
Failure to Resolve a Project Design Issue in a Timely Manner Resulted in Increased Project Costs of $4.5 Million: Although CA/T Project management became aware of cost increases due to a design issue with the NSRL, this issue was not resolved until approximately 20 months later.
As a result, the CA/T Project incurred approximately $4.5 million in unnecessary design and construction costs.
Improper Utilization of $6.9 Million in State Highway Funding for Non-Highway Purposes: The CA/T Project used approximately $6.9 million in state highway funds for preliminary design and construction of the NSRL, which is a non-highway project and failed to obtain reimbursement of these costs from the parties that benefited.
The OSA report recommended that the CA/T Project should obtain reimbursement from the MBTA and other parties that benefited from the expenditure of the $6.9 million of highway funds for the design and construction activities associated with the NSRL and use those funds to defray current CA/T Project costs.
The OSA also recommended that to preclude the significant increased costs associated with unresolved design issues, CA/T Project management should take immediate action to ensure that optional design issues are resolved in a timely manner.
The Review of Commitments Made to the East Boston Community Regarding the I-90 Logan Airport 1A Interchange, August 29, 2001
In May 2000, the OSA received letters from two East Boston community advocacy groups alleging that certain commitments made to the community during the environmental review process conducted in 1990 and 1991 were not being honored by the CA/T Project.
The OSA spoke with representatives from the two East Boston community advocacy groups and their attorney, CA/T Project representatives, Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency (MEPA) and FHWA officials, and the former Secretary of Transportation and Construction, under whose auspices the plans, designs, and environmental analyses were conducted.
The former Secretary of Transportation and Construction stated in his affidavit to the court and in a letter to the OSA that the commitments in question had been made verbally in a number of different forums.
Moreover, the former Secretary acknowledged that, although the commitments were not specifically stated in writing, they are reflected in the drawings, profiles, and cross-sections of the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report and Statement.
However, CA/T Project officials disagree that the commitments in question were made.
Notwithstanding the above disagreement, the OSA review indicated that the CA/T Project followed the mechanism for proposing changes to the East Boston portion of the CA/T Project, principally the preparation of the Notice of Project Change and an Environmental Reevaluation.
In addition, the CA/T Project appears to have complied with all MEPA and National Environmental Policy Act procedures and guidelines as promulgated by various statutory requirements and therefore, obtained the necessary approvals for changes to its construction plans.
Also, noteworthy is the fact that one of the advocacy groups filed a lawsuit in federal district court challenging the FHWA's approval of the CA/T Project changes.
The court found that FHWA properly considered each of the impacts raised by the advocacy group and concluded that the changes were not significant enough to warrant the preparation of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement.
Upon appeal, the federal appeals court affirmed the district court's decision in favor of the defendants.
In March 2000, the Massachusetts Attorney General wrote to the Chairman of the Turnpike Authority requesting that the CA/T Acting Project Director meet with the former Secretary for Transportation and Construction to discuss the relative merits of a proposal that reportedly could save CA/T Project costs as well as satisfy East Boston community concerns.
Subsequently, the parties met and discussed the proposals, and in a July 2000 letter, the CA/T Acting Project Director stated that he would request a review of the points raised in the proposal, and upon completion, to reconvene a follow-up meeting to review the findings.
The OSA endorsed these efforts and in a letter dated April 2001, recommended that the CA/T Project Director finalize a meeting with former Secretary for Transportation and Construction to resolve the issue of whether the East Boston community's concerns can be accommodated through redesign of the segments of the CA/T Project at issue without impacting the CA/T Project's cost, schedule and performance goals.
Activities Related to Quarry Hills Project
The Quarry Hills Project is a recreation complex being developed by Quarry Hills Associates (QHA) under a lease agreement with the City of Quincy.
When completed, the recreation complex will include a golf course, clubhouse, baseball and soccer fields, and a skating pond.
The recreation complex sits primarily on land formerly used as landfills in the City of Quincy, the Town of Milton, and a Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) parcel leased to the City of Quincy.
At the outset of the project, it was agreed that several additional land parcels owned by private parties would be purchased and added to the recreational complex.
Several other parcels were subsequently purchased.
The Quarry Hills Project presently includes approximately 474 acres.
The CA/T Project required the uninterrupted and timely removal of at least 8 million tons of excavated material from the CA/T Project work sites.
Fortuitously, developing the former City of Quincy and Town of Milton landfills into a recreational complex would require the extensive use of fill.
Thus, the QHA Project offered the City of Quincy, the Town of Milton, and the MDC the opportunity to convert closed landfills into recreational land.
It also offered the CA/T Project the opportunity to dispose of millions of tons of excavated material within eight miles of the CA/T Project construction site.
Accordingly, the MHD entered into an agreement with the City of Quincy for the delivery of 8 million tons of fill that would be transported to the Quarry Hills location.
This tonnage was subsequently increased to about 12.8 million tons.
A legislative request was made to the OSA to determine if property that might have been purchased with state funds could properly be sold to a private developer and if federal and state dollars are being spent as intended.
The Senator requestor also wanted to know the amount of work and money needed to complete the project and if there are any QHA representations or constituent concerns not being addressed.
In summary, the State Auditor reported that the proposed sale by QHA of a land parcel to a private developer is a private matter, not subject to Chapter 30B of the General Laws and the expenditure of federal and state money appears to be adequately safeguarded.
Moreover, the Auditor found that the Quarry Hills Projects construction schedule is progressing satisfactorily, appropriate steps have been taken to ensure project completion, and representations are being adhered to by QHA.
ON-GOING OSA REVIEWS
Section 17 of Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1995 required additional on site auditors and investigatory personnel to monitor activities related to the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project.
In accordance with those requirements, the OSA has significantly increased its on site audit staff.
Prior to the establishment of the Commission the OSA had three audit staff on site reviewing CA/T Project activities.
Through the 2000/2001 period the OSA has had between five and seven full-time audit staff and an Assistant Audit Director on site to monitor CA/T Project activities.
In addition, there are other senior management audit staff who continue to devote related time and effort towards the OSA and Commission oversight responsibilities along with appropriate levels of support staff.
During the fourth year of the Commissions operations, the OSA continued work on one additional on-going CA/T Project related assignment and initiated work on another.
$400 Million Statewide Road and Bridge Program
Serious concerns have been voiced by Federal, State, and private organizations' officials regarding the drain on both Federal and State highway funds by the CA/T Project.
Many of these officials have stated or suggested that needed funds have been used or earmarked for the CA/T Project.
Because of these concerns, DOT's 2001 Appropriations Bill Section 340(a) requires Massachusetts to adopt a balanced statewide program of $400 million in accordance with its agreement with DOT and the local Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) or face withholding the obligation of all Federal funds and all project approvals for [CA/T Project] in fiscal 2001 and each fiscal year thereafter.
The Massachusetts Legislature enacted Chapter 87, Section 12 of the Acts of 2000, which provided MHD with an additional $100 million to ensure that sufficient resources are available to fund the Statewide Road and Bridge Program at $400 million per year.
Accordingly, MHD is committed to spending $400 million annually for construction activities exclusive of the CA/T Project through fiscal year 2005 (June 30, 2005).
OSA has initiated an audit to determine if MHD is fulfilling its agreement to spend $400 million for road and bridge projects statewide.
To verify the accuracy of MHDs reported expenditures for fiscal year 2001, are reviewing a sample of payment vouchers to verify that (1) the nature of the expenditures were consistent with the criteria set out in the MOU and Chapter 87, (2) the payments were made with fiscal year 2001 funds, (3) the payments were authorized, and (4) the payment was calculated accurately according to the documentation accompanying the payment vouchers.
The OSA is also examining all 8 fiscal year 2001 Federal Transit Administration (FTA) transfers totaling $32 million or about 7% of the total Program that were counted as part of the $400 million Statewide Road and Bridge Program but not represented in the universe of payment vouchers.
These were transfers, requested by the State, from the federal Department of Transportations FHWA apportionment for Massachusetts to FTA so that the State could implement 45 public transit projects.
Review of the Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) Project's Management Reserve, August 29, 2001
In August 2001, the OSA initiated a survey of the CA/T Project's Management Reserve, also referred to as the Management Contingency Fund.
The purpose of this review is to evaluate the CA/T Project's $493.8 million Management Reserve Fund to determine the reasonableness of the size and need for this and other reserves and to identify and assess the effectiveness of the internal controls governing the funding and use of the reserves.
An identification for the internal controls governing the funds will be conducted, and these controls will be tested for adequacy and compliance with prudent business practice, CA/T Project policies and procedures and any applicable statutory requirements.
OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL [27]
An interdisciplinary team within the OIG monitors the design and construction of the CA/T Project.
The team has been funded in part by funds provided by the Legislature for additional oversight initiatives under the auspices of the Commission.
With the funds appropriated through the 2000 transportation bond bill, the OIG has contributed to OCC staff salaries and equipment and contributed in-house expertise to prosecutorial cases that have resulted from the OIGs investigative inquiry into CA/T Project finances.
The OIG team conducts reviews originating primarily from three sources: initiatives resulting from staff assessments of areas that are particularly vulnerable to waste and abuse, legislative directives and issues, and CA/T Project requests for technical assistance.
Team members routinely monitor, and selectively examine, CA/T Project generated reports on such management issues as scheduling, finance plans, and change orders.
The OIG has also undertaken joint projects with other state oversight agencies, particularly the two other Commission members offices the OAG and OSA.
Regardless of how a case or review originates, coordination and avoiding duplication of the efforts of other oversight agencies are high among the issues the OIG considers as it structures cases and deploys resources.
Specific examples of oversight coordination, including joint projects, appear elsewhere in this report.
OIG INITIATIVES
Review of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Finances
Records show that local FHWA officials acted in partnership with state officials to downsize the Big Dig cost estimate for public relations purposes.
IG report, March 2001
In March 2001, after a yearlong review of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project also known as the Big Dig cost overruns, the OIG issued a detailed report to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, entitled A History of Central Artery/Tunnel Project Finances 1994 - 2001.
The report addressed issues related to the $1.4 billion Big Dig cost overrun announced in February 2000.
The announcement of this overrun followed a December 1999 bond issuance and was prior to a February 2000 bond issuance.
By October 2000, Big Dig officials announced that the overrun had increased to $2.5 billion.
The OIG examined the history of this overrun and found that it resulted from budget assumptions made in 1994 and 1995 that were accepted by federal officials.
OIG staff also examined what role federal, state and CA/T Project officials had in creating and maintaining the assumptions after 1995 and what role they had in failing to disclose the overrun to the state Legislature and the financial markets.
Although the Office of the State Treasurer had conducted an extensive due diligence review in preparation for the December 1999 bond issuance, the OIGs investigation uncovered information that was not disclosed to the Office of the State Treasurer.
During the pre-sale period for those bonds, the Turnpike Authoritys outside counsel acknowledged to CA/T Project officials, but not publicly, that the Big Dig faced an almost $1.4 billion overrun.
A late night fax sent by the outside counsel for the Turnpike Authority seven days before the bond sale stated: These are hard numbers, not worse case #s [numbers].
This fax was sent the night before the Governor and other state officials met with Wall Street analysts to discuss the Commonwealths bond rating.
The Turnpike Authoritys outside counsel initially withheld this disclosure document from the OIG under a purported claim of attorney-client privilege.
In June 2000, while the OIGs yearlong review was still ongoing, the OIG brought this document to the attention of the Turnpike Authority Chairman.
These are hard numbers not worst case #s [numbers].
Document faxed by Turnpike Authority outside counsel before December 1999 bond sale, December 1999
The OIG reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents related to the period 1994 to 2000 and internal Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) documents related to a detailed budget review conducted in 1995 by FHWA officials.
The OIGs review revealed many troubling facts about Big Dig finances, including the following:
Ã¯Â¿Â½
In 1994, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB), the states management consultant responsible for administering the Big Dig, provided the Governor and state officials with a Big Dig cost estimate of almost $14 billion, a figure uncannily close to the June 2000 current $14.1 billion estimate.
B/PBs $14 billion estimate in 1994 starkly contradicted the $8 billion estimate (more exactly $7.998 billion) offered publicly by Big Dig officials28 at that time.
After B/PB presented its $14 billion estimate in 1994, state managers directed state and B/PB staff to undertake a cooperative effort to maintain the fiction of an on-time and on-budget $8 billion project.
Records showed that they did so by applying a largely semantic series of exclusions, deductions, and accounting assumptions that covered-up the $6 billion difference.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Internal FHWA records showed that in 1995, B/PB officials disclosed to local FHWA officials all budget assumptions that Big Dig officials had used to shrink the Big Dig cost estimate from $14 billion to $8 billion.
Records revealed that local FHWA officials acted in partnership with state officials to downsize the Big Dig cost estimate for public relations purposes.
In early 2000, federal officials investigated the cause of the Big Dig cost overrun; they concluded that state officials had deceived local FHWA officials.
FHWA records contradicted this conclusion.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Big Dig and local FHWA officials shirked their fiduciary responsibilities by not disclosing all relevant financial facts to the public, the State Legislature, or -as required by law- the bond markets.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Governor, the Chairman of the Turnpike Authority, and the Commonwealths Secretary of Transportation and Construction failed to fulfill their responsibility to implement the reporting requirements of M.G.L. c. 3, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 17 of the Acts of 1997.
The Legislature required semi-annual Big Dig Finance reports that disclosed the true nature of CA/T Project costs and CA/T Project finances.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Big Dig files were reportedly missing, computer hard drives had allegedly been destroyed, and many documents continued to be shielded from the public by attorney-client privilege.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Office of the State Treasurer ultimately forced Big Dig officials to disclose the cost overrun through its due diligence review of February 2000.
[T]his Office concludes that the current Governor and his appointees have not disclosed the real Big Dig budget story to federal investigators, Congress, the State Treasurer, and the State Legislature.
IG report, March 2001
The OIGs report called for an independent federal investigation by Congress into the FHWAs role in downsizing the Big Dig cost estimate and for a re-examination of the FHWA-imposed funding cap that has harmed the citizens of Massachusetts by saddling them with billions of dollars in added debt.
As a result of the OIGs report, the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation signed a letter to the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Transportation requesting that there be an investigation into the allegations contained in the report.
Senator John McCain and Congressman Harold Rogers also sent letters to the U.S. Department of Transportation requesting that an investigation be undertaken.
The Joint Committee on Transportation of the Massachusetts Legislature called for a hearing into the matter.
At this hearing, B/PBs Big Dig Manager confirmed that the Governor was told in 1994 of the $14 billion cost projection and he also stated that he told the former CA/T Project Director that he was concerned that information should flow higher than [the Director].
The Massachusetts Attorney General also began an investigation and has issued numerous subpoenas.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing its investigation and has issued subpoenas as well.
The DOTIG and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have also initiated investigations.
None of the parties referred to in the report have offered official denials of any of the specific allegations.
In a press release issued the day after the OIG released the report, B/PB stated:
The report confirms that, in accordance with its contracts, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff (B/PB) provided its clients, the Massachusetts Highway Department and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with complete, timely and accurate information about the actual and estimated cost of completing the CA/T Project.
Under those contracts and state law, B/PB fulfilled all of its reporting obligations.
The report also confirms that other state and federal officials were simultaneously aware of this information.
Beyond satisfying its contractual requirements, B/PB has met or exceeded all standards of professional practice regarding cost control and reporting.
Cost Recovery Program Review
In December 2000, the OIG issued a report entitled A Review of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project Cost Recovery Program.
In general, cost recovery is the process by which owners file claims against design and construction management professionals for the costs claimed to be attributable to errors, omissions, or other unsatisfactory performance.
This report assessed whether the CA/T Project had developed an independent and viable program, whether staff adhered to procedures, and whether the CA/T Project pursued objectives in a prudent, well-documented, and timely manner.
The review yielded the following specific findings:
In six years, the CA/T Project had only recovered $30,000 from about $83.5 million in cost recovery related change orders.
The CA/T Project set up the cost recovery program primarily to ensure federal funding, not to recover costs.
B/PBs overly broad role in CA/T Project management undermined the Commonwealths ability to hold B/PB accountable for its design work.
The CA/T Project failed to pursue cost recovery against B/PB.
Changes to the cost recovery procedure reflected the CA/T Projects increased reliance on B/PB, while internal organizational relationships impeded Turnpike Authoritys ability to hold B/PB accountable for its performance.
Moreover, B/PBs conflicting interests in the cost recovery program served as yet another example of the vulnerabilities of the current contractual arrangement.
CA/T Project management directed B/PB to subcontract for the services of the consultant responsible for assessing B/PBs potential liability for cost overruns.
The cost recovery program showed serious signs of neglect.
On average, CA/T Project staff took more than a year (394 days) to close cost recovery cases.
CA/T Project staff lost or misplaced much cost recovery files.
The CA/T Project did not, under the cost recovery program, actively pursue alternative methods of cost recovery.
CA/T Project managers limited the cost recovery program to design-related issues.
Many of the cost recovery files were incomplete.
The CA/T Project did not adequately document cost recovery cases.
The unsigned and undated closing memoranda contained references to information that was not in the records in the file.
The CA/T Projects closing memoranda did not accurately document the review process or adequately document the cost recovery committees rationale for recommending no further action.
The cost recovery procedure examined during this review did not mandate the use of stated criteria nor did it provide adequate guidance for identifying and pursuing cost recovery actions.
The cost recovery program failed to provide guidelines or training to staff members, including resident engineers, who were closest to the issues.
The cost recovery procedures did not adequately describe the responsibilities and objectives of the cost recovery committee.
The committee could revise the procedures without written justification.
In some cases, the CA/T Project failed to assess accurately the full cost impact of deficient design work.
CA/T Project management eliminated an effective method for catching potential cost recovery actions that B/PB may have missed.
The structure of the program provides no assurance that deficient performance will be detected and no evidence that costs incurred as a result of deficient designer performance would be pursued through the cost recovery program, even if the problem had been detected.
In the context of the $14+ billion CA/T Project, the $30,000 recovered so far barely registers as a token nod to recovering costs.
IG report, December 2000
The OIG recommended that the CA/T Project take the following corrective actions:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Revisit the earlier decision not to regard the cost recovery program as an opportunity to cut costs or reduce the net cost to taxpayers.
Based on results, designers including B/PB have no reason to believe that they will be held accountable through cost recovery action for their mistakes.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Use the cost recovery program to send a clear message that all design professionals on the CA/T Project will be held accountable for their design work.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Reassess the basis for determining whether to pursue a cost recovery case.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Avoid conflicts of interest by ensuring that the Turnpike Authority or MHD, not B/PB, contracts directly for any services aimed at assessing B/PBs liability for design deficiencies.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Delink B/PB and Turnpike Authority organizations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Define clearly and follow through on the purpose and processes of the cost recovery program procedures.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide training and guidelines to increase the likelihood that those closest to the issues in the field, including resident engineers, identify cost increases caused by deficient design.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Explore and vigorously pursue cost recovery opportunities that go beyond the current program boundaries, including recovery actions for construction management issues and indirect cost overpayments to consultants.
CA/T Project management concurred with many of the report findings concerning program neglect and inadequate documentation.
Notwithstanding CA/T Project managements strenuous objections to many other findings and conclusions, the OIG was pleased to note evidence of steps taken to remedy the problems documented in the report.
Bid Law Compliance
In a June 2000 letter, the OIG cautioned CA/T Project management against reducing the scope from future Charles River Basin construction contracts after the completion of the bidding process.
The CA/T Project considered reducing the scope of the contracts after awarding them to be a cost-savings measure.
The OIG has consistently taken the position that what goes out to bid should reflect the final scope of work on the project to the extent possible.
Moreover, the Massachusetts public bidding laws prohibit omitting portions of the scope of work after the bids are opened, even if it is done to reduce costs.
At the CA/T Projects request, the OIG addressed the use of M.G.L. c. 149 alternates on M.G.L. c. 30 contracts.29 The OIG wrote that M.G.L. c. 30, Ã¯Â¿Â½39M bidders may use alternates, but must follow the rules that govern the use of alternates by their M.G.L. c. 149, Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½44A-44J counterparts.
Use of alternates would require that the CA/T Project list the alternates numerically in order of priority, and then consider each in the same numerical order.
In closing, the OIG urged the CA/T Project to confer with its own legal staff and the OAG, if necessary, to determine how to proceed in the particular situation.
The CA/T Project responded that all contracts would comply with bid law requirements, including any use of alternates.
The CA/T Project informed the OIG that it was considering M.G.L. c. 149 alternates on one or more of the Charles River Basin Parks contracts, which would soon be ready to bid under M.G.L. c. 30, Ã¯Â¿Â½39M.
LEGISLATIVE ISSUES
Legislatively Mandated Reviews
Under Section 56 of Chapter 235 of the Acts of 2000, no construction or contractual agreement for construction shall begin prior to the review and approval of the Inspector General[,] if the construction is to be in connection with the ventilation buildings, utility facilities, and toll booths that are part of the CA/T Project.
Since 1994, similar language has mandated these reviews, although the Inspector Generals approval before construction could begin was not required until 1996.
The OIG initiates the review once the CA/T Project provides notification that the CA/T Project plans to advertise for bids for a specific contract.
The OIG then performs a preliminary review of the contract, in most cases before the CA/T Project advertises the contract.
The OIG completes the review after monitoring the bid process and any design or specification changes that occur during the process.
Final review results are provided in writing to the CA/T Project leadership, the Legislature and others as appropriate.
Dewey Square Air Intake Structure
The OIG completed a review of documents related to the $10.9 million Dewey Square Air Intake Structure, a planned three-story building that will provide fresh air supply for the depressed artery.
The contract includes the building construction, supports for two ventilation fans, exterior site improvements, temporary street lighting, and maintaining the realigned Atlantic Avenue Bypass Roadway.
The OIG identified a number of concerns regarding cost, compliance, and planning.
The problems disclosed by the OIGs review did not merit withholding approval for the contract to proceed into construction and the Inspector General granted approval in May 2001.
Nevertheless, the OIG urged CA/T Project officials to address a number of troubling issues the OIG identified as a result of this and previous reviews.
The OIG warned that if the CA/T Project persists in failing to adequately address these and related issues, the OIG would consider withholding future approvals:
Third-party changes/Architectural features.
The Commonwealth assumed the financial risk of future joint development by paying an estimated $300,000 to design a architectural feature (curved vault roof) that was included in the contract to conform with the needs of a specific joint development partner who may not be able to participate due to lack of funding.
The OIG expressed concern about the inclusion of architectural features to support plans for future development by third parties that may never materialize and recommended that CA/T Project management examine and control carefully the cost of design features for joint-development purposes to ensure that public funds are not wasted.
Life-cycle cost analysis.
The OIGs review disclosed no evidence that the CA/T Project completed a formal life-cycle cost analysis.
Properly conducted life-cycle cost analyses identify all costs for acquisition, construction, operations, and maintenance of a facility for its useful life.
Knowing potential operations and maintenance costs also allows the operator to assess and plan for financing these future expenses.
The OIG recommended that CA/T Project staff prepare information pertaining to these costs and provide it to the Turnpike Authority staff charged with managing CA/T Project-related functions and financing.
Contract drawings.
The OIG reiterated its opinion that the CA/T Project had not complied with the requirements of the Massachusetts Board of Registration for professional engineers for reviewing and approving contract drawings.
The OIG also identified errors and inconsistencies in the drawings and urged the CA/T Project to correct the problems.
Construction interface/Access restraints.
The OIG expressed concern about the potential for added costs due to contract interface and site access restraints, in part because connecting the air intake structure would be performed under a different contract.
The CA/T Project has incurred additional costs due to coordination problems in the past.
The OIG noted that prudent action by the CA/T Project, such as efficient site coordination and construction sequencing, would prevent costly delay claims and reduce the risk of change orders caused by additional mobilization and other delay-related costs incurred by the contractor.
Claims avoidance review.
As a result of the OIGs inquiry, CA/T Project staff purport to have completed this type of review, which aims to mitigate changes and disputes arising from complex design and construction contract interdependencies.
Aggressive cost control should include claims avoidance reviews before bids are opened, not afterwards as occurred on this contract.
The OIG also noted that the CA/T Project had not provided documents to the OIG in a timely manner and had not yet complied with certain notification requirements under M.G.L. c. 149.
In its June 2001 letter of response, CA/T Project management acknowledged that not all documents were provided in a timely manner and indicated that the matter would be remedied for future requests.
Although the CA/T Project Director took issue with several of the findings, he noted that staff agreed to correct certain design package errors, concurred with the need for site coordination, and would make the changes necessary to ensure compliance with the public bid laws.
LEGISLATIVE REVIEWS AND TESTIMONY
The OIG is obligated under its enabling statute, M.G.L. c. 12A, to review all legislation filed in each legislative session.
When appropriate, the Inspector General comments in written and oral testimony to the Legislature and the Governor on proposed legislation; often, the Inspector General recommends specific amendments to bills.
In the 2000 and 2001 sessions, the OIG commented on hundreds of pieces of legislation.
This section highlights OIG testimony on CA/T Project-related issues.
Written Testimony to the Members of the Joint Committee on Transportation
In an April 2001 letter to the legislative Joint Committee on Transportation, the Inspector General supplemented his oral testimony on CA/T Project finance issues (see summary of OIG report beginning on page 32.
The Inspector General noted that although the OIG finance report was without doubt the most extensive CA/T Project finance-related review the OIG had conducted, it was by no means the first time the OIG had raised finance, accountability, and cost-related concerns.
The Inspector General reminded the Committee that the OIG had issued 14 reports, conducted 11 statutorily mandated reviews of CA/T Project building contracts, completed 22 technical assistance reviews at the request of CA/T Project officials, and sent scores of letters to the Legislature and other public officials.
The OIG has made in excess of 400 recommendations aimed at containing costs, increasing public accountability, and reducing vulnerability to waste and abuse.
The Inspector General warned the Committee, as the OIG had warned legislative and CA/T Project leaders many times before, about the vulnerabilities of the contractual arrangement between the Commonwealth and B/PB, the joint venture hired in 198530 to manage design and construction of the CA/T Project.
In the late nineties, public officials reorganized the CA/T Project management structure.
This new so-called integrated project organization (IPO), rendered the CA/T Project vulnerable to divided loyalties, conflicting interests, and further undermined public officials ability to hold B/PB accountable for bringing the CA/T Project in on time and within budget.
According to CA/T Project managers, the IPO was designed to match staff members technical skills to jobs without regard to the organization paying their salaries.
The resulting organizational scheme has the potential to be an accountability nightmare.
For example, the Turnpike Authoritys Director of Construction reports both to B/PBs top program manager and to the Turnpike Authoritys Project Director.
This individual (the Turnpike Authoritys Director of Construction) has represented the Turnpike Authority in contract negotiations with B/PB, even though he reports to B/PB managers.
In written testimony, the Inspector General also reiterated his earlier concern about the enormous power granted to the Turnpike Authority when the Metropolitan Highway System was created in 1997 (M.G.L. c. 81A).
He urged state leaders to retain control concerning the CA/T Project in order to insure the publics representation in decisions about who will pay how much of the spiraling CA/T Project price tag.
Written Testimony to the Legislative Commission on Surface Artery Restoration
In June 2001, the OIG conveyed to the Legislative Commission on Surface Artery Restoration (Legislative Commission) concerns about air rights development on the Central Artery Corridor, an area that the Legislative Commission was charged with reviewing under paragraph 8 of St. 2000, c. 87, Ã¯Â¿Â½20.
For many years, the CA/T Project finance plans contained a credit of hundreds of millions of dollars for anticipated revenue from leasing air rights to private developers.
However, the law does not require the Turnpike Authority to conduct an open, fair, and competitive process when it selects private developers for the air rights above the Central Artery Corridor.
While not disputing the Turnpike Authoritys rights in air space over land that it owns, the OIG argued that the public interest should be adequately safeguarded in any disposition process.
The revenues generated from leasing air rights will likely be significant.
CA/T Project officials and the Legislature are counting on it.
The OIG observed that the public deserved a fair deal and a good deal when the Turnpike Authority leases these valuable assets to private developers.
The OIG urged the Legislative Commission, as it prepares its report and proposes legislation, to require a fair, open, and competitive process for the disposition of air rights in the Central Artery Corridor, as well as the Central Artery North Area and the Ted Williams Tunnel.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Central Artery/Tunnel Project: Management Issues and Recommendations
In December 2000 the OIG issued a report containing correspondence regarding management issues and recommendations in 22 technical assistance reviews conducted by the OIG since 1993 at the request of CA/T Project officials.
These reviews examined complex design and construction management problems, commented on procurement processes, and clarified legal compliance requirements.
Regardless of the topic, the purpose of the reviews has been to identify systemic vulnerabilities to waste and abuse, point out opportunities for savings and cost control, and assist CA/T Project leaders to better oversee and manage their own operations.
IG report, December 2000
Throughout the 22 reviews undertaken at the CA/T Projects request, the OIG has consistently offered advice and urged the actions summarized in the list below:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop the internal organizational capacity to monitor and control costs on management consultant, design, and construction contracts.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Define performance standards and work products to be delivered under contract; hold vendors accountable for performance, including cost and schedule.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Guard against conflicts of interest and the appearance of impropriety in the hiring of staff and the assignment of functions among employees and private consultant staff.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Avoid sole source procurements, which may increase CA/T Project costs and unfairly favor one vendor over others.
Justify any sole source procurement in writing and obtain the requisite review and approval.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop clear CA/T Project procedures and guidelines.
Ensure compliance with all applicable statutory requirements, procedures, guidelines, and management mandates.
Failure to comply with key directives can increase the Commonwealths vulnerability to cost overruns and future litigation.
The OIG noted that, based on the written responses to the reviews documented in this report, the CA/T Projects track record for decisive action on technical assistance recommendations had been mixed.
CA/T Project management had been most responsive to the OIGs recommendations concerning ways to improve proposed systems for procuring management consultant and design-related services.
Prevailing Wage Compliance
In a July 2000 letter to the CA/T Project, the OIG responded to the CA/T Projects earlier request for technical assistance by reviewing a report prepared by a CA/T Project consultant regarding prevailing wage compliance by a CA/T Project trucking subcontractor.
The CA/T Project hired a consultant (an accounting firm under contract with MHD) to review an allegation that a subcontractor had failed to pay prevailing wages.
The CA/T Project requested that the OIG review the consultants report and comment on whether the consultant appeared to have adequately addressed the issue.
The OIG concluded that while review of the allegations should have been referred to the OAG rather than an accounting firm, the consultant had adequately addressed the concern of CA/T Project staff, given the scope of the review and the fact that it was a review and not an audit.
The OIG also recommended that the CA/T Project:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conduct a follow-up review of those truckers from whom the consultant could not obtain satisfactory answers or contact.
Use a larger sample of truckers and conduct periodic reviews of this sort.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Review internal procedures to ensure that non-compliance can be detected.
Evaluate the effectiveness of the compliance unit.
Conduct quality assurance/quality control audits of the compliance unit.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Forward all allegations and violations related to prevailing wages to the OAG.
In light of past prevailing wage violations and the recent investigations into allegations of extortion, excessive overtime, and theft on the C12A3 I-93 Massachusetts Avenue Interchange construction contract, CA/T Project management should consider an internal reassessment of how it handles its obligations under the law.
OIG letter to CA/T Project Acting Director, July 2000
The CA/T Project responded in a November 2000 letter stating that CA/T Project staff regularly reviewed records and interviewed workers to ensure compliance.
The CA/T Project noted that it would continue to review its procedures to ensure that compliance mechanisms are accurate.
The CA/T Project also stated that it had made at least 25 referrals regarding prevailing wage issues to the OAG.
Request for Qualifications and Proposal (RFQ/P) for Audit Services on CA/T Professional Services Contracts
In January 2001, CA/T Project staff requested the OIGs assistance in developing an RFQ/P for selecting certified public accountant firms to perform federally required audits on millions of dollars in consulting contracts on the CA/T Project.
The request emanated, in part, from the OIGs earlier criticism of the flawed process for procuring audit services and the troubling backlog of audit work.
The OIG had urged CA/T Project management to ensure the organizational independence of the audit function and to aggressively pursue recovery of overpayments to consultants.
During February 2001, CA/T Project managers provided a rough draft of the RFQ/P to the OIG and briefed OIG staff on their concerns and objectives in procuring professional audit services.
CA/T Project staff invited input to help ensure that the RFQ/P appropriately articulated the services required and established a fair and justifiable ranking system.
A subsequent draft reflected the CA/T Projects efforts to incorporate the OIGs recommendations.
For example, it required respondents to submit all questions in writing, and required that the proposed project manager and key personnel play a major role at the interviews.
In April 2001, the CA/T Project provided a newly revised draft of the RFQ/P and requested additional assistance in ensuring that the scope and evaluation criteria are appropriate, fair, complete, and clear.
In response, the OIG provided more than two dozen suggestions, including more rigorous qualification and experience requirements, provisions for bimonthly status reports, and evidence to demonstrate a history of meeting high performance standards.
The OIG indicated its willingness to provide additional assistance as needed.
