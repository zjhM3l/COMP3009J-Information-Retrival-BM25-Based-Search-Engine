The notice of violation was received by Licensee on April 10, 1997.
An evidentiary hearing was held on this matter on January 13, 1998 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Upon review of the transcript of this hearing, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:

(N.T. 17-19)
CONCLUSION OF LAW :
Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION:
At the hearing held on the matter, the enforcement officers testified in detail as to the operation of the five video gambling machines seized from the licensed premises.
Licensee did not appear at the hearing although duly notified of the place and time thereof.
Section 5513 of the Crimes Code provides, in part, that a person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree if he intentionally or knowingly sets up or maintains a slot machine or any device to be used for gambling purposes.
A video slot machine is by definition a gambling device per se.
Furthermore, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that proof of a gambling payout made on a video poker machine is not necessary where the machine is determined to be a gambling device per se.
Cmwlth. v. Twelve Dodge City Video Poker Machines, 537 A.2d 812 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1988) The presence of such a gambling device on a licensed premises constitutes "other sufficient cause" as that term is used under Section 471 of the Liquor Code and is the basis for the issuance of a citation.
PRIOR RECORD :
Licensee has been licensed since February 15, 1934, and has had two prior violation(s) since July 1, 1987, the date of establishment of the Office of Administrative Law Judge, to wit:
