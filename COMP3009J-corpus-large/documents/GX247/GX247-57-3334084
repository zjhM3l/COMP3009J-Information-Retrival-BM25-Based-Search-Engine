News School Health Services Volume 15, Number 2, January 2002 National School Nurse Day-January 23, 2002 The 2002 National School Nurse Day is January 23.
The theme for School Nurse Day is: "Partners with Children."
The purpose of this day is to develop better understanding of the school nurse in the educational setting.
The fourth Wednesday in January has been set aside for over two decades for the recognition of school nurses.
The National Association of School Nurses has a School Nurse Day News Release on the web: http://www.nasn.org/schoolnurserelease2.htm
The Role of the School Nurse in Providing School Health Services
The school nurse role is crucial in providing school health services states the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Pediatrics, November 2001, Volume 108, Number 5, p. 1231-1232.
This position statement describes the school nurse's unique role as a member of the school health team, provider of health services, and collaborator with primary care physicians, specialists, and local public health and social service agencies for effective services for students and their families.
The AAP supports the continued strong partnership among school nurses, school health personnel, and pediatricians to promote the health and education of children and youth through a coordinated school health program, a medical home for each child,^ and integrated health, education, and social services for children at the community level.
Position statement available on the web: http://www.aap.org/policy/re0050.html
Condition of Education Shows Reading Improvement
"After 10 years of decline in elementary reading comprehension scores, the 2001 scores showed slight increases.
Our hope is this is the beginning of an upturn in Iowa students reading comprehension.
We must continue our commitment and investment in instruction to see the improvements," said Ted Stilwill, director of the Department of Education.
The report found public school enrollment declined .9percentage.

CDC Study Shows Status of School Health Programs Nationwide
In the largest and most comprehensive assessment of school health programs ever undertaken, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found schools are doing better at establishing policies for healthier students.
The School Health Policies and Programs Study 2000 (SHPPS 2000) was conducted in districts and schools in all 50 states.
U.S.
Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said, "Schools not only teach our children to read and write, but also to take care of their bodies and mind.
Schools are the ideal places to promote good health because most young people are in school five days a week during the school year."
In the United States, 53 million young people attend approximately 117,500 elementary and secondary schools for about six hours of classroom time per day with more than 95 percent of 5-17 year-olds enrolled.
Consequently schools are the only public institutions that can reach nearly all youth and are, therefore, in a unique position to improve both the education and health status of young people throughout the nation.
A SHPPS summary is in the September 2001, Journal of School Health and fact sheets and highlights are on the CDC website: www.cdc.gov/shpps.
U.S. Department of Education-National Center for Education Statistics
The U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics reports on efforts by public K-8 schools to involve parents in children's education.
The report answers two major questions: Do children's parents acknowledge the efforts that schools reportedly are making? In addition, do schools report the same level of parent participation in school programs as parents do? This report compares parents' and schools' views of how schools involve parents in their children's education and how parents respond to the opportunities for involvement that schools provide.
The findings can assist policymakers, educators, researchers, and school staff in their efforts to evaluate parents' involvement in their children's education.

Iowa Department of Public Health Immunization Letter to School District
On April 18, 2000 the Iowa Department of Public Health sent the following letter to a school district regarding the definition of transfer student applied to the Iowa immunization requirements.
This letter is in response to your concerns regarding the definition of "transfer student" being extended to students who are entering Iowa's school system from foreign countries.
The Iowa Department of Public Health, Bureau of Immunization, and the Attorney General's office have interpreted the term "transfer student" to mean students arriving from domestic (U.S.) school systems.
We know that all states in the U.S. have entrance requirements that at a minimum mandate all students show proof of immunization or have a recognized exemption to immunization.
This requirement does not extend beyond the borders of the United States.
Some countries do have similar requirements and immunization histories from other countries should be readily available, however, many countries have no such requirements and vaccine preventable diseases are common in those areas of the world.
Therefore, students arriving from foreign countries do not qualify under the provisional enrollment category that would allow them 120 days or the end of the semester to show proof of immunization.
These out-of-country students should, prior to school entry, show proof of at least one of each of the required vaccines - tetanus-diphtheria (Td), polio (OPV or IPV), and measles-rubella (MMR).
They may then be placed on a provisional enrollment allowing them to complete the minimum required immunizations (2 additional Td and polio and one additional measles-rubella vaccine if first enrolled in school on or after July 3, 1991) by the end of the semester or 120 days.
If we can be of any further assistance, please contact me at 515/281-4938.

Iowa Department of Public Health-Mercury Fact Sheet
The Iowa Department of Public Health, Division of Environmental Health, Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) program was established to collect and analyze Iowa information about emergency releases of hazardous substances that occur.
The purpose of the mercury fact sheet is to reduce exposures, injuries, and deaths resulting from hazardous substance releases.
Debbi Cooper, Iowa Department of Public Health, Division of Environmental Health, HSEES Program, 515 242-6337.
Liquid Mercury Facts
This fact sheet contains general information regarding liquid mercury and its risks as well as information about how people can protect themselves from exposure and adverse health effects.
The fact sheet has been developed as part of a combined study between the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Iowa Department of Public Health.
The Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) System collects data on emergency hazardous substance releases.
The system's purpose is to reduce the incidence of injury and death associated with the release of hazardous substances.
A clear understanding of how and why liquid mercury releases occur and how to avoid them can assist in better training.
It can also improve the safety of employees, emergency responders, and the general public.
In Iowa, from January 1991 through June 2001 there were 23 mercury releases reported to the HSEES System.
Seven events occurred in schools, seven were in resident's homes, six occurred in a factory or industry setting, two took place at medical facilities, and one event was the result of illegal dumping at a county park.
An evacuation took place during seven of the events and one individual sought medical care after becoming ill after mercury exposure.
What is Mercury? Although this fact sheet will focus on liquid mercury, there are hazards associated with other types of mercury.
There are three types of mercury:
Inorganic (e.g., Mercuric or mercurous mercury).
This type of mercury is a naturally occurring element released when volcanoes erupt and rocks erode.
The problem with the element arises when sources of this type of mercury, such as coal-burning power plants and mining ore deposits, release additional mercury into the air.
Bacteria and other processes in lakes and rivers can convert inorganic mercury into methylmercury.
Organic (e.g., Methylmercury).
When inorganic mercury is deposited into the water microorganisms, help convert it to methylmercury, which is a more toxic form that accumulates in fish.
Elemental (i.e., Liquid mercury).
Liquid mercury is used in thermometers, fluorescent light bulbs, and medical equipment such as instruments that measure blood pressure.
Some people use liquid mercury in ethnic folk medicine and for religious practices.
More recently, glass pendant necklaces containing liquid mercury have become popular among high school children.
How Can Liquid Mercury Affect My Health? The central nervous system is very sensitive to mercury vapors.
Although liquid mercury is not directly toxic, the vapors from it are.
Short-term or long-term exposures can lead to serious health problems.
Exposure to high levels of liquid mercury vapors can permanently damage the brain, kidneys, and the developing fetus.
Effects on the brain may result in irritability, shyness, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and memory problems.
Short-term exposure to liquid mercury may result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in blood pressure or heart rate, skin and eye irritation, and lung damage.
How Can I Reduce the Risk of Exposure to Liquid Mercury? Avoid using products that contain liquid mercury.
Properly dispose of all products that contain liquid mercury, such as thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs.
Urge your local school system to stop conducting experiments in science classes that involve liquid mercury, to use less hazardous substances to demonstrate scientific principles, and to dispose of unnecessary hazardous chemicals in storage.
If you must use a product containing liquid mercury, store it safely in a leak and shatterproof container and in a locked, secure place.
When liquid mercury spills, it breaks into tiny beads.
Those beads can roll into cracks in floors or walls, or may become trapped in carpet or upholstered furniture.
Liquid mercury vaporizes and can rapidly spread throughout a room.
If spilled near heating ducts, the vapor can spread throughout a home or building quicker.
Without proper cleanup, people may be exposed to hazardous levels of liquid mercury vapors.
What Should I do if a Small Spill Occurs? If you must use a product containing liquid mercury, a mercury spill kit should be kept on hand.
If there is a minor release of mercury, such as from an oral or rectal thermometer, and a mercury spill kit is not available use the following steps:
Wear rubber gloves (to be thrown away)
Keep children and pets out of area during clean up
Use stiff paper or cardboard to gently sweep beads of mercury onto a dustpan or another piece of stiff paper or cardboard.
Use a flashlight to help find any remaining particles.
Duct tape, packing tape, or masking tape may be used to pick up small particles.
Place mercury in wide mouth container, tape lid in place, and dispose of in garbage.
Dispose of all items that may have touched the mercury in a plastic zip lock bag or sealed garbage bag.
For spills greater than the amount contained in a thermometer:
Evacuate and secure the spill area.
Before people leave, be sure shoes, clothing and other articles have not been exposed to mercury.
Close all doors, windows, ducts, and passageways that lead to other rooms.
Ventilate the affected room by opening all windows and doors that open to the outside.
Call your local health department or the Statewide Poison Control Center (1-800-352-2222) for instructions on safe clean up.
DO NOT try to clean up liquid mercury without getting advice from a poison control center or your local health department.
DO NOT sweep a liquid mercury spill with a broom.
DO NOT vacuum a liquid mercury spill.
Vacuuming will rapidly spread liquid mercury vapors into the air, increasing exposure and contaminating the vacuum.
DO NOT pour mercury down a drain.
It may lodge in the plumbing and cause future problems.
DO NOT use household cleaning products to clean up a spill.
These products may contain bleach or ammonia that can react violently with liquid mercury.
The following items are examples of reported incidents involving liquid mercury.
Â¨ In June 1996, liquid mercury was taken from a middle school and played with by a group of teenagers both inside and outside of the school building.
Approximately 200 children were tested for mercury exposure, one child was hospitalized, and another five underwent outpatient treatment.
Twenty other children had mildly elevated mercury levels but not to levels that are known to affect health.
Â¨ In May 2000, a student spilled liquid mercury at a high school forcing the closure of the school while workers decontaminated the building.
Â¨ Approximately 50 students were evacuated from an Iowa college dormitory after someone dumped approximately a half-cup of liquid mercury outside a shower stall.
This allowed vapors to form and the mercury was subsequently spread throughout the dormitory.
Â¨ A student rolled a ball of liquid mercury down the aisle of a school bus, potentially exposing dozens of students.
The student also shared the liquid mercury with three other students.
The liquid mercury had been stolen from a science room.
The ramifications of this act were thought to have lead to possible contamination of other schools, buses, vehicles, and homes.
More information about mercury in schools may be accessed through the Mercury in Schools website: www.mercury-k12.org.
Mandatory Abuse Reporters-Training Requirement
The 2000-2001 Iowa Legislature amended the Child and Dependent Abuse reporting law (Iowa Code, Chapter 232).
School employees added to mandatory reporters with reporter training required are coaches holding a coaching authorization and certified paraeducators.
The licensing board will require the training as part of licensure.
The training requirement is two hours every 5 years
Mandatory Abuse Training-Iowa Board of Nursing
A new requirement for nursing licensure is a course on identification and reporting of abuse when applicable in your job.
On your next nursing license renewal you will be asked: "In your employment/self employment as a RN or LPN, do you examine, attend, counsel, or treat children or adults on a regular basis?" If you answer yes to the question, you must check one of the following: Within the last five years, I have completed the training program/s related to identification and reporting of child and/or dependent adult abuse; I am exempt from the abuse training requirement because I am serving active duty in the military; I am exempt for the abuse training requirement because I hold a current waiver from the board; or None of the above choices are true.
The required training course does not have to be offered by an IBON approved provider although it may be.

Anthrax Question: A school nurse asked, "We had a suspicious letter here at school.
Law enforcement was called and they did not feel there was any concern.
The officer said that using an iron to run over the letter would kill any anthrax.
Is this accurate information? Answer: No, ironing is not recommended.
The efficiency in killing spores would be low if nonexistent.
Also, it could an unsafe practice and fire would be a possibility.

Fleas: Fleas are usually cat fleas and 99+% are associated with household pets.
These animals need to be treated with one of the newer "once a month" flea treatments available from practicing veterinarians.
Note that flea collars just are not effective in these situations.
Next, one must work on the home environment.
Basic to this process is a vacuuming that borders on one having a character trait of compulsivity, i.e. vacuum the carpets and floors similar to mowing the yard.
Don't miss an inch.
Also, do the baseboards etc where the floor meets the wall.
Targeted spraying also helps.
Ken Holster, ISU Extension Entomologist recommends retail outlets products sold in Windex-type bottles costing less than $10.
Spray the area where pets hang out and other difficult to clean-vacuum areas.
Re-spray these areas every 2-4 days recognizing the life cycle is 21 days.
Don't expect miracles with these measures.
It probably will take 2-3 weeks to get noticeable relief.
Treatment of children with an occasional flea is not recommended.

School Breakfast Program-New Report: www.frac.org The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) released a report on the School Breakfast Program.
Participation in the School Breakfast Program set records in the 2000-200l school year, with more than 6.5 million low-income children nationwide served daily by the program.
The number of low-income children served daily rose from the prior school year, and is almost double the 3.4 million in 1990.
Three of four (75.9 percent) of the 96,213 schools that offered school lunch also offered school breakfast, another record.
"Millions of children suffer from hunger because of low family incomes and millions more are hungry when school starts or by mid-morning because of today's complicated work and commuting schedules," said FRAC President Jim Weill.
"The School Breakfast Program is doing an important, and increasingly effective job to make sure children get the nutrition they need every day to be healthy and prepared to learn and it needs to grow more rapidly and adapt to make an even greater difference."

Tobacco use is the single leading preventable cause of death in the United States.
Approximately 80% of tobacco users initiate use before age 18 years.
If the trend in early initiation of cigarette smoking continues, approximately 5 million children aged 
The economic costs associated with tobacco use ranges from $53 billion to $73 billion per year in medical expenses and $47 billion in lost productivity.
Because of these health and economic consequences, CDC has recommended comprehensive tobacco-control programs to reduce tobacco use among youth.

Interpretative Statement: Iowa School Nurses and Delegation
The interpretative statement, prepared by the School Nurse Delegation Workgroup: Ellen Johnson, AEA 4; Susie Poulton, AEA 10, Kathy Deibert, AEA 6, and Charlotte Burt, DE and reviewed by Lois Churchill, Iowa Board of Nursing is proposed for comments and suggestions.
Please send comments to Charlotte Burt by February 1,2002.
Purpose: Today, increasing numbers of students need special health services to participate in their educational program.
Providing services requires interdisciplinary coordination between education, health, and human services.
These coordinated services include nursing delegation of school health services designed to protect student health, safety, and welfare.
The purpose of this interpretative statement is to provide a resource for school nurses and school personnel regarding the school nurse delegation decision-making process.
Background: The registered nurse (RN) delegates nursing tasks while retaining accountability.
There is no substitute for the professional registered nursing delegation judgment.
The basis of all delegation decisions is student safety and welfare.
Other workers have a place and are equipped to assist, but not replace, the registered nurse in nursing care.
RNs are accountable to provide safe, effective nursing care.
This requires employers, peers, and coworkers to support the RN and share responsibility in providing safe, quality health services.
The Iowa School Nurse is a registered nurse licensed to practice by a state board of nursing.
The School Nurse has the legal, professional, and ethical autonomy to make decisions about delegation in accordance with the:
Â· Iowa Code (Iowa Code Â§ 152) Practice of Nursing, Iowa Administrative Code Nursing Practice for RNs (655 IAC 6), Iowa Administrative Code Discipline (655 IAC 4), and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (655 IAC 7)
Â· Standards of Professional School Nursing Practice (National Association of School Nurses and American Nurses Association, 2001)
Â· School Nursing Code of Ethics (National Association of School Nurses, 1999)
To practice within the scope of delegation authority, the School Nurse is accountable and responsible for:
Â· maintaining documentation of personal competence and education
Â· knowledge, skills, experience, instruction, and supervision
Â· determining if the student specific service(s) may be delegated;
Â§ appropriate circumstances, setting, and resources
Â§ delegation to the right person for the right reason(s)
Â§ service direction and description including clear and concise objectives, limits, and expectations
Â§ supervision including monitoring, evaluation, intervention, and feedback (NCSBN Adopted by the Iowa Board of Nursing March 1996)
Â· action or failure to act of self or others performing health services included in the individual health plan and emergency plan
By applying the legal, professional, and ethical delegation obligations, the School Nurse begins the delegation decision-making process of assessment, diagnosis, outcome identification, planning, implementation, and evaluation (Appendix A Example).
The student's health file contains the detailed delegation decision-making process documentation (Appendix B Example).
Gathering Assessment Information: The School Nurse identifies:
Â· information sources including and not limited to health providers, student, family, and education team
Â· individual student health service needs
Â· resource needs
Â· student and or personnel supervision needs
Nursing Diagnoses and Outcome Identification: Once the assessment is completed, the resulting nursing diagnoses and outcomes direct services and determine action priorities in delegation decision-making.
The nursing diagnoses describe the student's current health status.
The outcomes are statements describing the desired health goals.
They are meaningful, measurable, observable, and useful in making decisions.
The School Nurse also considers their value to the student and family and the impact of their achievement on the student's school performance.
Applying the information obtained through assessment, diagnosis, and outcome identification, the School Nurse proceeds to the planning step of the delegation decision-making process.
Planning Individual Health Service(s) and Emergency Health Service(s): The School Nurse analyzes the assessment in consultation with the student, family, staff, and education team and determines whether to delegate considering:
Â· high outcome predictability (stability)
Â· minimal service complexity (competence)
Â· low harm potential for the student and others (harm)
Â· student level for self-care (self-care)
Â· minimal problem solving required (decision-making)
If the school nurse determines the student's safety and welfare requires the RN to provide the service, the nurse communicates with the education team on the delegation decision-making process.
The School Nurse develops the individual health plan (IHP) and emergency plan (EP) which includes a back-up plan(s) in case the service provider is not available.
After completing the planning step, the School Nurse proceeds to the implementation step of the delegation decision-making process.
Implementation: When the School Nurse determines the service may be safely delegated to another person, hereafter referred to as the assistive personnel, the School Nurse develops the assistive personnel implementation plan including:
Â· designating the assistive personnel to perform the service(s)
Â· instruction content and updates
Â· demonstrated competency level
Â· frequency and level of supervision (in same area, on site, or on call)
Â· provision of ongoing support
The assistive personnel providing the service(s):
Â· understands responsibility and accountability to provide the service(s) as instructed
Â· understands and follows lines of communication in the plan
Â· demonstrates service knowledge and skill(s) competency
Â· agrees to the level and frequency of supervision
Â· agrees to perform the service(s) as instructed (Iowa Code Â§Â§ 280.23)
Â· agrees to ask questions, communicate concerns promptly, and document service provision
Â· signs an agreement of understanding (Appendix C Example)
The School Nurse provides the ongoing continuous evaluation step of the delegation decision-making process following implementation.
Evaluation: The School Nurse will:
Â· review the delegated process and outcomes
Â· maintain ongoing communication and observation with assistive personnel
Â· determine follow-up measures to continue to meet student needs
Â· adjust the plan as needed to meet new and changing needs
Â· document the evaluation findings
The School Nurse's accountability and responsibility for student advocacy requires immediate reporting, documentation, and resolution of a situation when safety is in question.
"RNs are accountable to provide safe, effective nursing care.
This necessitates that employers, payers, peers, and coworkers support the RN and share the responsibility to provide safe, quality student health services" (Minnesota Nurses Association, 1997).
Summary
Iowa Registered School Nurses ensure safe provision of special health services through the delegation decision-making process.
This process allows students to receive and benefit from their educational program through the safe, competent provision of needed special health services.
Qualified health personnel determine service(s) to be delegated to assistive personnel with the utmost regard for student safety and protection.
Definitions
Accountability: The RN, according to their nursing license, is responsible and answerable for delegating special health services and self-action or inaction of self.
When assistive personnel accept delegation, they agree to be responsible for self-action or inaction in providing the service(s) as instructed.
Assistive personnel: An individual, without health licensure, including various titles (unlicensed assistive personnel, qualified designated personnel, classroom assistant, paraeducator, paraprofessional, secretary, teacher, and others) functioning in an assistive role delegated by the RN.
The assistive personnel is instructed, competent, and supervised in providing the health service(s) described in the individual health plan (281 IAC 41.96(1)).
Decision-making: The School Nurse uses the nursing process when determining health service delegation and documents the process.
Delegation: The School Nurse, in collaboration with the education team, assigns the performance of the health service(s) in a selected situation, not requiring the registered nurse knowledge and skill level, to a competent assistive personnel determined by the delegation decision-making process (Iowa Code Â§ 152.1(2)(c)).
The recommendation of the licensed health personnel receives primary consideration.
When the delegation decision of the team members differ, a dissenting opinion may be filed (281 IAC 41.51).
The RN instructs and supervises the assistive personnel performing health service(s).
Additional references: Iowa Code 152.1(2)(c) and 655 IAC 6.2(5).
Documentation: Maintaining a written or electronic record of the decision-making assessment, diagnosis, outcome identification, planning, implementation (instruction, return demonstration, competency, assistive personnel agreements, communication), evaluation, and revision(s) of the health service(s) in the IHP, EP, and IEP.
Additional delegation documentation includes but is not limited to the student name, health service, prescriber, date, time, name and title of the person providing the service, detailed notes on service provision, and unusual circumstances.
Evaluation: Analysis of the student's response(s) to the delegation process and progress toward identified outcomes.
The data collected during the systematic ongoing evaluation is documented and used to make decisions about modifications, additions, or deletions.
The school nurse reviews the IHP, EP, and back-up plan in collaboration with the student, family, school team, and assistive personnel whenever the student's health status changes, or at least annually.
Health assessment: The process to determine the student's health status through the health information relating to the IHP and EP (281 IAC 41.96(1)).
Sources of information include, but are not limited to interviews with the student and family, review of the student health record and medical records, health history, physical assessments and measurements, developmental and or family assessments, school professional's observations, and the education team.
The school nurse interprets the information using professional knowledge and expertise to indicate how the health status affects educational performance and to determine delegation.
Health service instruction: Education by the school nurse or other qualified health personnel to prepare assistive personnel to deliver and perform special health services contained in the IHP and EP. Documentation of the education and updates is on file (281 IAC 41.96(1)).
Individual health plan (IHP): A written confidential document detailing the provision of the special health service(s) in the education program and desired outcomes.
The IHP, EP, and back-up (reserve or substitute) plans document the nursing process.
The school nurse and other qualified health personnel develop this document with the health provider, family, student, and education team.
The specific health services and provider(s) are included in the Individualized Educational Program (IEP), selected items integrated into the IEP, the plan(s) location noted in the IEP, and updated as needed and at least annually (281 IAC 41.96(1)).
Special health service: Includes, but is not limited to, service(s) for individuals whose health status, stable or unstable, requires interpretation or intervention, administration of health procedures and health care, or use of a health device to compensate for the reduction or loss of a body function (281 IAC 41.96(1)).
Supervision: The School Nurse provides oversight including and not limited to observation, guidance, direction, instruction, evaluation, and follow-up of the assistive personnel providing the delegated special health service(s) (NCSBN, 1995).
"Levels of supervision include situations in which licensed health personnel are physically present, licensed health personnel are available at the same site, and licensed health personnel are available on call" (281 IAC 41.96(1)).
Various levels of school health expertise
Registered nurse (RN): Licensed to practice nursing by a board of nursing to formulate nursing diagnoses, conduct nursing treatment, carry out physician instructions, supervise and teach other personnel in the performance of nursing care activities, perform additional services requiring education and training, and apply scientific principles (Iowa Code Â§ 152 and 655 IAC 6).
Â· School Nurse: The School Nurse is a registered nurse, licensed to practice in accordance with the laws, rules, Standards of Professional School Nursing Practice (National Association of School Nurses and American Nurses Association, 2001) and the Code of Ethics for the School Nurse (National Association of School Nurses, 1999).
"School Nursing is a specialized practice of professional nursing that advances the well being, academic success, and life-long achievement of students.
To that end, school nurses facilitate positive student responses to normal development; promote health and safety; intervene with actual and potential health problems; provide case management services; and actively collaborate with others to build student and family capacity for adaptation, self management, self advocacy, and learning" (National Association of School Nurses, 1999).
Â· Nurse: Each board that employs a nurse shall require a current license to be on file (281 IAC 12.4(12)).
