The citation contains two counts.
Count one of the citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S.Â§4-471] and Sections 5513 and/or 5514 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§Â§5513 and/or 5514], in that on November 7, 2001, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on the licensed premises.
Count two of the citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 491(10) of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-491(10)], in that on November 7, 2001, Licensee, by its servants, agents or employes, fortified, adulterated and/or contaminated liquor.
The investigation which gave rise to the citation began on May 11, 2001 and was completed on January 16, 2002; and notice of the violation was sent to Licensee by Certified Mail on January 31, 2002.
The notice of violation was received by Licensee on February 1, 2002.
An evidentiary hearing was held on this matter on August 27, 2002 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Upon review of the transcript of this hearing, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:
FINDINGS OF FACT:
COUNT ONE 1.
Licensee is located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and holds Restaurant Liquor License Number R-AP-SS-EHF-9862.
(N.T. 4, 33) 2.
On November 7, 2001 at 1:45 p.m., enforcement officers conducted an open inspection and found a bartender, Deborah Cuda, rendering service of alcoholic beverages to seven patrons.
(N.T. 8) 3.
Next to the cash register, the officers found two partially completed football pools each consisting of 100 grid blocks; one cost $1.00 per grid to play and awarded a cash prize of $100.00; the second cost $2.00 to play and awarded $50.00 at the half and $150.00 for the final score; the pools winners were randomly determined by card drawing and the scores of the football games.
(N.T. 9-13 Exhibit C-5 and C-6) 4.
The officers also found a World Series baseball pool consisting of a 100 grid block costing $5.00 per grid to play, and awarding a $500.00 cash prize with the winner determined by random drawing and the score of the baseball game.
(N.T. 9-13 Exhibit C-7) 5.
In the two drawers under the cash register, the officers found a moneybag with $380.00, and an envelope labeled football pool containing $107.00.
(N.T. 13-14) 6.
The officers found one Cherry Master video slot machine, one Astro Magic Ball video slot machine, and a Magical Odds video slot machine set up inside and operational.
(N.T. 14) 7.
Officer Kahlil inserted $1.00 into each machine which gave him 20 credits to play for a value of five cents per credit.
(N.T. 14, 20-21) 8.
Officer Kahlil found the video slot machines required no skill to play, and credits were erased by pressing a ticket button which dispensed one serialized ticket for each 200 credits on the machines.
(N.T. 20-21, 25-26 Exhibit C-8) 9.
The value of each ticket was $10.00 equaling 200 credits at five cents per credit.
(N.T. 20-21) 10.
Later that day, Officer Kahlil examined the interior components of the three seized video slot machines and found each contained a power interrupt circuit, video accounting for the amount of money played and the number of credits knocked off, and a total of $290.00 in currency, which included $40.00 the officer put in.
(N.T. 20-25, 29-30 Exhibit C-8) 11.
The serialized tickets could be used to account for the amount of credits erased from the video slot machines.(N.T. 25-26 Exhibit C-8) 12.
The officers found a wall poster mounted above the video slot machines labeled wall clock 100 tickets and Radio 300 tickets.
(N.T. 14, 24) 13.
On the wall to the right of the poster was a shelf holding an AM/FM clock radio, portable TV, and a Walkman-type radio.
(N.T. 14, 24, 47-48) 14.
The values of the AM/FM clock radio, portable TV, and Walkman-type radio were from $10.00 to $27.00, less than the tickets required to win them as prizes.
(N.T. 24, 47-48) 15.
It was theoretically possible for a player to insert $1.00 into a video slot machine, receive 20 credits, and play and accrue enough credits to win the prizes.
(N.T. 26) 16.
The officers did not observe any gambling pay offs made on the video slot machines.
(N.T. 27) 17.
Licensee knew that the football and baseball pools and the video slot machines were on the licensed premises.
(N.T. 44-46)
COUNT TWO
Finding one is incorporated herein.
1.
On November 7, 2001, during the open inspection of the licensed premises, enforcement officers seized five liquor bottles for analysis.
(N.T. 15-16) 2.
On December 10 and 11, 2001, a forensic scientist examined the five bottles of liquor and found, as follows: a) One liter bottle of Kamchatka Vodka had dirty, worn labels, a small amount of debris and was slightly evaporated; b) One liter bottle of Kamchatka Vodka had dirty, worn labels, a small amount of debris and was slightly evaporated; c) One liter bottle of Kamchatka Vodka had dirty, worn labels, a small amount of debris and was slightly evaporated; d) One liter bottle of Palo Viejo Rum was overfilled, contained debris and was refilled and contaminated; e) One liter bottle of Kessler Blended Whiskey had a very old worn label, the contents were cloudy with sediment and very evaporated with only 15.78 percent ethanol of a 40 percent ethanol guarantee.
(N.T. 31-38)
CONCLUSION OF LAW:
Counts one and two - Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION:
At the hearing held on the matter, two enforcement officers and a forensic scientist testified for the Bureau.
Licensee appeared without counsel.
On August 26, 2002, the day before the hearing, Mr. Wilner requested a continuance due to lack of counsel.
His request was denied in accordance with Title 40 Pa.
Code, Section 15.54, Continuances, for lack of good cause.
Licensee also testified that in June 2002 he filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.
(N.T. 42-44 Exhibit L-1)
As to Count one, Officers Kahlil and Randic testified in detail as to seizing baseball and football pool cards and three video slot machines during an open inspection on November 7, 2001.
The pool cards cost between $1.00 and $5.00 to enter, and awarded cash prizes of $50.00 to $500.00 based on the winning scores of the sports games.
The sports pools have the three elements of gambling, i.e., consideration, chance and reward, and are illegal.
Com. v. Laniewski, 98 A.2d 215, (Pa.
Super.
1953).
Officer Kahlil examined the machines interior components and found each machine operated on U.S. currency, awarded credits based on chance and not skill, and awarded serialized tickets which were redeemable for a small radio or television.
The serialized tickets could be used to account for the amount of credits erased from the machines.
Also, it was possible for a patron to play $1.00 and win a radio or television prize.
Licensee testified that the cost of the small radio and television were $10.00 to $27.00.
He did not testify that any prizes were actually awarded to patrons.
He also argued that the officer did not observe any payoffs on the video slot machines.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that proof of a gambling payoff made on a video machine is not necessary where the machine is determined to be a gambling device per se.
Com. v. Kratsas, 764 A.2d 20, Sup. 2001; Commonwealth v. Twelve Dodge City Video Poker Machines, 537 A.2d 812 (Pa. 1988).
Also, the Court in Commonwealth v. Irwin, 535 Pa. 524, 636 A.2d 1106 (1993) held a redemptive token feature is not a reward for the purposes of gambling law in this Commonwealth because the player cannot win an amount of equal or greater value than the amount placed in the machine.
I distinguish this administrative citation case sub judice from Irwin because Licensees video slot machines have the ability to dispense a 200 credit ticket worth $10.00 (200 @ .05 cents) to a winning player who inserts only $1.00 to play.
The machines in Irwin had internal controls to keep the value of the prize less that the cost of playing the games needed to win.
The Court also stated that this (redemptive token feature) does not prevent the Commonwealth from prosecuting machine owners where there is evidence that the redemptive token feature is actually being used in a impermissible manner.
Irwin at 1109.
I find the three video slot machines were gambling devices per se.
Licensee knew or reasonably should have known that illegal gambling was taking place on the licensed premises.
PLCB v. TLK, Inc. 544 A.2d 931 (Pa. 1988).
As such, Count one of the citation is sustained as charged.
As to Count two,Section 493(10) of the Liquor Code provides as follows:
Fortifying, adulterating or contaminating liquor
(10) For any licensee or any employe or agent of a licensee or of the board, to fortify, adulterate or contaminate any liquor, except as permitted by the regulations of the board, or to refill wholly or in part, with any liquid or substance whatsoever, any liquor bottle or other liquor container.
The Bureaus chemist testified as to his analysis of the five seized bottles of liquor and they were contaminated with dust like debris, had less alcohol than a true sample due to evaporation, and one bottle was overfilled.
Licensee denied refilling any liquor bottles.
I find the testimony of the Bureaus chemist to be more credible.
As such, Count two is sustained as charged.
