BACK TO CRITERIA LIST Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) [Ardeparin (NormifloÃ¯Â¿Â½); Dalteparin (FragminÃ¯Â¿Â½); Enoxaparin (LovenoxÃ¯Â¿Â½) [Developed in August 1999; Revised August 2000; July 2001; July 2002; August 2003]
All criteria may be applied retrospectively; prospective application is indicated with [*].
1.* Dosage
Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are indicated for use in in treating thromboembolic events and preventing thromboembolic complications following hip or knee replacement surgery or abdominal surgery as well as preventing or treating thromboembolic complications following hip or knee replacement surgery or abdominal surgery as well as preventing ischemic complications of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
Dosages are dependent upon therapeutic diagnosis and are summarized in Table 1.
In some circumstances, dosages for LMWH area calculated based on body weight; therefore, maximum daily dosages are not readily identifiable.
Table 1
Recommended LMWH Dosages TREATMENT INDICATION DOSAGE Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis for knee replacement enoxaparin: 30mg SC every 12 hours DVT prophylaxis for hip replacement surgery enoxaparin: 30mg SC every 12 hours or
40 mg SC once daily
dalteparin: 5000 IU SC once daily DVT prophylaxis for hip replacement surgery enoxaparin: 40mg SC every 12 hours
dalteparin: 2500 IU SC once daily
risk patients, 5000 IU SC once daily DVT, PE treatment enoxaparin: 1mg/kg SC every 12 hours
tinzaparian: 175 anti-Xa IU.kg SC once daily
Unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI dalteparin: 120 IU/kg (not to exceed 10,000 IU) every 12 hours in conjunction with aspirin therapy
enoxaparin: 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours in conjuction with aspirin therapy 2.
Duration of Therapy
When prescribed as preventive therapy, LMWH should be administered until the risk of deep venous thrombosis has diminished (see Table 2).
When utilized in the management of DVT and pulmonary embolism, warfarin therapy is typically initiated within 72 hours of enoxaparin therapy.
Enoxaparin is continued until a therapeutic anitcoagulant effect with warfarin has been achieved.
Recent studies suggest that LMWH are effective as monotherapy in preventing DVT when utilized for certain postsurgical conditions (e.g., total knee replacement) or in patients requiring continued anticoagulant therapy for management of venous thromboembolism on an outpatient basis in place of warfarin.
Advantages include shortened hospital stays and reduced need for laboratory monitoring.
One potential disadvantage involves an increased bleeding incidence seen with LMWH when compared to warfarin in several studies.
Further studies will help to delineate the expanded role of LMWH in DVT management.
Enoxaparin has been determined to be more effective than heparin in limiting coronary ischemic complications associated with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI).
Dalteparin has been shown to be more effective than placebo and comparable to heparin therapy in reducing mortality and MI in patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave MI. Dalteparin or enoxaparin treatment is administered in conjuntion with aspirin therapy and should be continued until clinical stabilzation is achieved in these patients (a minimum of 2 days for enoxaparin therapy).
LMWH treatment duration varies with respect to therapeutic indication and is summarized in Table 2.
Dosage regimens exceeding these recommendations will be reviewed.
Table 2
LMWH Treatment Duration THERAPEUTIC INDICATION TREATMENT DURATION RANGE MAXIMUM TREATMENT DURATION DVT prophylaxis for knee replacement surgery
enoxaparin:usual duration- 7-10 days ardeparin: 14 days
enoxaparin: 14 days DVT prophylaxis for hip replacement surgery dalteparin: 5-10 days
enoxaparin: 21 days dalteparin: 14 days
enoxaparin: 21 days DVT prophylaxis for abdominal surgery dalteparin: 5-10 days
enoxaparin: usual duration- 7-10 days dalteparin: 10 days
enoxaparin: 12 days DVT, PE treatment enoxaparin: usual duration- 7 days
(warfarin therapy initiated within 72 hrs of enoxaparin
*tinzaparin: usual duration - at least 6 days (warfarin therapy initiated within 72 hours of tinzaparin)
enoxaparin: 17 days
tinzaparin: until patient is adequately anticoagulated with warfarin
Unstable angina, non-Q-wave MI dalteparin: 5-8 days
enoxaparin:usual duration- 2-8 days dalteparin: 8 days
enoxaparin: 8 days
* Tinzaparin should be administered for at least 6 days in conjunction with warfarin therapy until the patient achieves an INR of 2.0 for at least two consecutive days.
3.* Duplicative Therapy
Concurrent administration of multiple low molecular weight heparin products does not provide additional therapeutic benefit and is not recommended.
Patient profiles containing concomitant prescriptions for two or more low molecular weight heparin products will be reviewed.
4.* Drug-Drug Interactions
Patient profiles will be assessed to identify those drug regimens which may result in clinically significant drug-drug interactions.
The following drug-drug interactions are considered clinically relevant for enoxaparin.
Only those drug-drug interactions classified as clinical significance level 1 or those considered life-threatening which have not yet been classified will be reviewed:
a.
Platelet Inhibitors (aspirin, salicylates, NSAIDs, clopidogrel - PlavixÃ¯Â¿Â½, cilostazol - PletalÃ¯Â¿Â½, ticlopidine - TiclidÃ¯Â¿Â½, sulfinpyrazone - AnturaneÃ¯Â¿Â½, dipyridamole - PersantineÃ¯Â¿Â½ [clinical significance level: salicylates - severe (First DataBank); ketorolac - severe (First DataBank); others - undetermined]
The combined use of LMWH and platelet inhibitors may produce an additive prolongation of bleeding time and an increased risk of bleeding.
The prolonged bleeding risk may persist for several days following discontinuation of platelet inhibitors.
Drugs that affect hemostasis should be discontinued prior to initiating therapy with LMWH to avoid antiplatelet activity.
If coadministration of LMWH and platelet inhibitors cannot be avoided, patients should be monitored closely for bleeding complications.
Concomitant administration of platelet inhibitors and LMWH is not recommended and will be reviewed.
