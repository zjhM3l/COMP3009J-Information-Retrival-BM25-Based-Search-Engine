A Message from Attorney General Jane Brady
Dear Consumer:
In order to make sure that you do not become responsible for the debts created by an identity thief, my office has prepared this special Identity Theft Victim Kit.
The Kit will help you prepare the written proof you will need to report identity theft and to prove that you did not incur the debts that the identity thief has created under your name
Please review the instructions in the Identity Theft Victim Kit carefully, and contact my Consumer Protection Unit at (800) 220-5424 if you have any questions about the Kit.
Sincerely, [sign.gif] M. Jane Brady Attorney General
Step 1: Promptly report the fraud to the police.
The first step you need to take is to report the fraud to your local police department.
This step is important for two reasons: First, it immediately alerts local law enforcement to the crime.
Second, it establishes that you acted diligently, and enables you to get a police report, complaint number or other similar record, which you may need when contacting your creditors.
If you are not sure which law enforcement agency to contact, call the Attorney General's Consumer Protection Unit at (800) 220-5424, and they will help you contact the proper police agency.
Step 2: Promptly report the fraud to the three major credit bureaus.
Because identity thieves often attempt to obtain credit under your identity, it is important to promptly contact the three major credit bureaus to report the fraud.
The three major credit bureaus may be contacted as follows:
Equifax: (800) 685-1111
Experian: (888) 397-3742
TransUnion: (800) 916-8800
Ask each credit bureau to take a report, and to place a "fraud alert" on your credit report.
Also, ask each credit bureau to send you a copy of your credit report, so you can determine the extent of any unlawful credit activity that may have taken place using your identity.
If you already have a police report, file number or complaint number from your local law enforcement agency, you may want to give that information to the three major credit bureaus as well, to help them investigate any disputed accounts or other reports of fraud.
Step 3: Contact the Fraud Department of each of your creditors and bank accounts.
Collect all your credit cards, bank accounts and other creditor information (such as utilities, cable, etc.) and their "fraud" departments.
Report the fraud to each creditor, even if that particular creditor has not been the subject of fraud, to ensure the creditor knows that an identity thief may have your account information.
Ask each creditor to place a "fraud alert" on your account.
If there are charges on your accounts that are illegal, most creditors will also ask you to submit a written report of the fraud, along with a police report, complaint number or file number from law enforcement.
You may use the enclosed Identity Theft Affidavit as part of your written report, to make sure you include all the necessary information.
Many creditors will ask you to submit such an Affidavit within two weeks of your report of fraud, so you need to act promptly.
Step 4: Report the fraud to the Federal Trade Commission.
The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") maintains a confidential, national Identity Theft database, and may also be able to assist in pursuing identity thieves through federal channels.
They may be contacted by calling (800) 525-6285.
(Hearing impaired consumers may call (800) 255-0056.
IDENTITY THEFT AFFIDAVIT Directions
It is very important that you complete your Identity Theft Affidavit promptly and accurately.
You may make as many copies of this Identity Theft Affidavit as you need.
Please make sure you fill in all the requested information, and please write neatly.
While you may choose not to provide some of the information requested in the Affidavit, please bear in mind that incorrect or incomplete information may slow the process.
Many companies investigating your claim will accept this Identity Theft Affidavit as your main report of fraud.
However, some companies may require that you submit additional or different information, or may require you to use their own forms.
Either way is fine.
But by completing the Identity Theft Affidavit, you will have all the key facts necessary to report the fraud in one convenient document.
Before you send your Identity Theft Affidavit to your creditors, contact each creditor to find out if they will accept this Affidavit.
It is also important that you include all relevant documents with your Identity Theft Affidavit.
Make sure you only send copies of your documents - do not send the originals.
Also, ask if you can fax your Identity Theft Affidavit and related documents to your creditors, to help expedite the process.
Once a creditor has investigated your fraud complaint, you will receive a written response telling you the outcome of their investigation.
Keep a copy of everything you send and everything you receive.
While completing this Affidavit does not guarantee that the identity thief will be captured, and that all disputed credit information will be fully resolved, it will help law enforcement and your creditors investigate the fraud and work towards helping you restore your good name.
