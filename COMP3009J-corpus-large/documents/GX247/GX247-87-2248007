FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: March 2, 2000 GOVERNOR PATAKI ANNOUNCES ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENT AWARDS [thinbar.gif] Projects Generate $17.27 Million In Environmental Investments for New York Businesses Governor George E. Pataki today announced the 1999-2000 recipients of the Empire State Development Corporation's Environmental Management Investment Program awards.
The awards, which total more than $5.6 million, will create 108 new jobs statewide and leverage an additional $11.6 million in additional investment in New York businesses and organizations.
"New York has demonstrated to the nation that economic growth and environmental protection go hand-in-hand," Governor Pataki said.
"We have helped create more than 662,000 new jobs and seen an explosion in corporate sitings here in New York over the last five years, while also restoring New York to its rightful place as an environmental leader.
"The Environmental Investment Program represents smart economic development that will benefit New Yorkers by creating more new jobs and a more livable New York," the Governor said.
"By rewarding businesses who share our vision of a cleaner, greener New York, we are attracting more green businesses to New York, creating more jobs and a better environment for New Yorkers."
Matching-fund commitments totaling $5.6 million were made to 35 New York organizations to reduce waste and increase pollution prevention statewide.
The awards range from $32,500 to $500,000, and are expected to leverage an additional $11,672,093 in public and private-sector investment.
Project funding is contingent upon award recipients fulfilling the terms and conditions of their contract.
Chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation Charles A. Gargano said, "The EIP demonstrates Governor Pataki's commitment to address the issues facing New Yorkers.
The Governor is creating a vibrant and growing economy, while investing in strategies that will help businesses improve the environmental quality of New York State."
The awards were made under the program's September 1999 funding cycle.
The program is administered by ESD's Environmental Management Investment Group (EMIG), which invests appropriations from the New York State Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) as part of the State's commitment to improving environmental quality.
These awards mark the first time that EMIG was able to consider pollution-prevention projects.
In 1998, Governor Pataki signed legislation broadening the scope of the program.
The new program goes beyond recycling market development and targets a broader spectrum of the environmental waste stream, thereby increasing opportunities for participation by a larger number of New York businesses.
Matching funds under the Environmental Investment Program are awarded twice annually for capital projects; research, development and demonstration of new products and technologies; and technical assistance to help companies achieve pollution prevention and recycling results.
Eligible projects are those that lead to the reuse, remanufacturing or recycling of materials otherwise destined for disposal, and pollution and waste prevention projects that lead to reductions in the volume or toxicity of waste before it is generated.
Eligible recipients include New York businesses, not- for-profit corporations and municipalities applying on behalf of New York businesses.
Program awards are based on a competitive review process and applicants must be in compliance with environmental regulations at the time of the award.
The State Environmental Protection Fund provides $125 million annually to support open space preservation, historic preservation, waterfront redevelopment, recycling, landfill closures and State and municipal parks.
Funding for the EPF has increased five-fold during Governor Pataki's tenure.
Since taking office in 1995, Governor Pataki has appropriated nearly $26 million from the EPF for the Environmental Investment Program.
The deadlines for submitting proposals in the upcoming 2000 award rounds are May 2 and Sept. 26, 2000.
Program packets describing project guidelines and the application process are available by contacting EMIG at 518-292-5340 (voice), 518-292-5886 (fax), or emig@empire.state.ny.us (e-mail).
Requests should include name, company, street address, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address.
Environmental Investment Program grants for the Fall 1999 funding cycle are:

Center for Economic Growth, Albany, N.Y. - Award Amount: $58,000; Total Project Cost: $116,150 .
Technical assistance project to hire consultants to train suppliers to Capital Compost Inc.
(Menands, N.Y.) on how to increase the quantity and quality of source- separated food waste for their state-of-the art, in-vessel compost facility.
Success of this project should result in improving cost efficiencies of the company's current operation by decreasing the amount of mixed-waste received at the facility, which still requires processing and includes a significant amount of material requiring disposal.
The project will also double the amount of source-separated waste coming into the facility from 10 tons per day to 20 tons per day.
These improvements should also save suppliers on food waste management costs, including area supermarkets, colleges and other large commercial industrial food waste generators.
Greater Glens Falls Development Corporation, Glens Falls, N.Y. - Award Amount: $225,000; Total Project Cost: $890,000.

Award Amount: $143,264; Total Project Cost: $259,242.
RD
The project will also assess the usefulness of the WCC as a source of carbon for composting manure generated on farms.
Lastly, it will determine whether composting WCC bedding with manure can serve as a long-term manure management solution for farms.
Success of this project could result in a business, Hudson Valley Compost, that uses locally generated WCC and WCC animal bedding mixed with manure from Wil-Roc and other local farms to generate a high-quality compost product that could conservatively be sold for $15 per ton.

Award Amount: $53,550; Total Project Cost: $103,650.
Research project to determine the most economical way to compost butcher shop wastes together with animal bedding from local horse farms and waste wood chips.
The project will also analyze the compost product to assess its potential as a supplemental nutrient for crops.
Success of this project could result in the development of an alternative use (composting) for more than 100 tpy of animal waste, and save the company over $8,500 per year in avoided disposal costs and a small amount on the avoided cost of fertilizer.
The outcomes of this project will serve as a model for other butcher shops and food processors facing the same waste management restrictions.
