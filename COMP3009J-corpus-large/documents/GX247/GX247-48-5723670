The notice of violation was received by Licensee on July 14, 1999.
An evidentiary hearing was held on this matter on November 3, 2000 in the U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building, Courtroom 4-A, 504 West Hamilton Street, Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Licensee did not appear at the hearing, nor did anyone appear on his behalf.

The notice set forth the date and time of the hearing as November 3, 2000 at 2:30 p.m., and the place of hearing as U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building, Courtroom 4A, 504 West Hamilton Avenue, Allentown, PA 18101.
Upon review of the transcript of this hearing, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:
FINDINGS OF FACT:
COUNT 1
1.
On April 3, 1999, Officer Paul Smith of the Bureau entered the licensed premises in an undercover capacity.
(N.T. 8).
2.
Shortly after entering, Officer Smith observed a male patron who was at the bar asking the two male bartenders for more beer.
This patrons speech was very slurred, and it was difficult for Officer Smith to understand what he was saying.
(N.T. 9).
3.
Both bartenders on duty on the licensed premises told the patron in response to his request for more beer, Give it about twenty more minutes.
Youre beginning to look better.
Have another Coke.
The patron was then given a Coca Cola.
(N.T. 9).
4.
At 11:15 p.m., the above described patron again asked for a beer.
One of the bartenders served him a Coors Light draft beer mixed with tomato juice.
(N.T. 9).
5.
The patron gulped down the beer and tomato juice and one of the bartenders gave him another beer mixed with tomato juice which the patron also drank.
(N.T. 10).
6.
At 11:30 p.m.
Officer Smith observed that this patron had completely incoherent speech.
He staggered badly as he went to the bathroom.
His eyes were glassy and his money was spread over into other patrons areas of the bar.
(N.T. 10).
7.
At 11:30 p.m. the bartenders began to serve the aforementioned patron regular beer without tomato juice.
(N.T. 10).
8.
At 11:50 p.m. a bartender gave this patron another draft beer.
(N.T. 10-11).
9.
At 12:15 a.m. a bartender put a six-pack of Coors Light beer in front of the patron and took money off the bar.
(N.T. 11).
10.
Shortly after receiving the six-pack, this patron was observed by Officer Smith talking to the Licensee, Mr. Haikalis.
He was staggering badly, leaning against the bar and swaying.
(N.T. 11).
11.
After speaking to Mr. Haikalis, the patron came back and sat down at the bar and asked for a glass of beer and a shot.
The bartender looked at Mr. Haikalis, who shook his head, yes.
The bartender then took the six-pack and put it back in the cooler and gave the patron a glass of draft beer and a shot of brandy.
(N.T. 11).
12.
Between 12:15 a.m. and 1:00 a.m., this patron was served four glasses of draft beer, three shots of brandy and a shot of Jack Daniels whiskey.
(N.T. 11-12).
13.
During the time this patron was served the aforementioned drinks, the bartenders, several times, stopped him from drinking from other patrons beer bottles.
(N.T. 14).
14.
At about 1:00 a.m.
Officer Smith heard the Licensee, Mr. Haikalis say to one of the bartenders, Shes waiting outside.
Help him out and drive his car and shell bring you back.
The bartender physically helped this patron out of the bar and returned about one half hour later.
(N.T. 14).
COUNT 2
15.
While on the licensed premises on April 3, 1999, Officer Smith observed two table-top size video slot machines turned on and ready for play.
He also observed two video poker machines that were not turned on.
16.
On April 10, 1999, Officer Smith returned to the licensed premises where he again observed the two video slot machines and the video poker machines all of which were turned on and set up for play.
(N.T. 15).
17.
On June 29, 1999 at 3:25 p.m., Officer Smith went to the licensed premises to conduct a routine inspection.
At that time he found three video slot machines and two video poker machines turned on and set up for play.
(N.T. 15-16).
18.
Officer Smith conducted a preliminary inspection on all of the slot machines and poker machines.
He put money into and played each machine.
He found that it only took five seconds to play a game on any of the machines.
(N.T. 16).
19.
Officer Smith further found that each machine had a multi-denomination bill acceptor, a power interrupt circuit and a knock off feature whereby credits could be erased from the machine.
(N.T. 16).
20.
The machines were seized and taken back to the District Office of the Bureau for inspection.
(N.T. 16-17).
21.
On July 2, 1999 Officer Smith conducted a full examination of the seized machines and found that each of the machines had the following characteristics: (a) A fast play feature: a hand or a spin took five seconds or less.
(N.T. 16 and 19). (b) A video accounting feature which accounted for the number of credits purchased and the number of credits knocked off.
(N.T. 19-21). (c) All but one of the machines had working mechanical meters inside them duplicating the video accounting feature.
(N.T. 19). (d) All of the machines accepted multiple denominations of currency up to and including twenty dollar bills.
(N.T. 19). (e) On each of the machines, it was possible to bet a maximum of $7.50 per hand or spin.
(N.T. 19). (f) All of the machines had dip switches which were used to change the odds of winning on the machines.
(N.T. 19-20). (g) No skill was involved in winning on any of the machines.
(N.T. 20 and 27). (h) All of the machines had power interrupt circuits which retained credits on the machines if the power was lost.
(N.T. 16 and 21). (i) The first machine was a Top Drawer Joker Poker machine which played 5-card poker.
It gave one credit for each twenty five cents ($.25) deposited.
It is possible to bet 30 credits per hand on this machine.
The machine deals five cards after which the player may raise the bet in an amount equal to the original bet.
At this point the player may discard the cards he doesnt want and hit the play button, and the machine supplies new cards for those that are discarded.
The player is then awarded credits based on his final hand.
(N.T. 24-25). (j) The other poker machine worked in the same way as the machine just described.
(N.T. 25). (k) The first slot machine was a Cherry Bonus machine.
It accepted up to twenty dollar bills.
A player could bet as many as 32 credits per spin.
When the player hit the play button video wheels would spin.
If the player got three of the same symbols in a row he would win.
If he won, the player could try to double his winnings with a double or nothing feature.
(N.T. 25-26). (l) All of the other slot machines had the same characteristics as the slot machine described above.
(N.T. 27)
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:
Counts 1 and 2 of the citation are sustained.
DISCUSSION:
COUNT 1
The record clearly establishes that on April 3 into April 4, 1999 a patron who was very obviously visibly intoxicated was served alcoholic beverages on multiple occasions.
I therefore conclude that the Bureau of Enforcement has met its burden and the charge in Count 1 of the citation is sustained.
COUNT 2
Because the machines seized on the licensed premises were gambling devices per se Licensee was clearly in violation of Section 5513(a) of the Crimes Code and was, therefore, subject to the penalty provision of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. Â§4-471].
It is the established rule that under proper circumstances, the sanctions provided by Section 471 of the Liquor Code (supra) may be imposed upon the holder of a liquor license who has violated a gambling statute.
Mar Kodis Diner, Inc. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, 532 A.2d 940 (Pa.Cmwlth 1987).
Section 5513(a) of the Crimes Code is violated if the person intentionally or knowingly maintains any device to be used for gambling purposes or allows any portion of the premises under his control to be used for the purposes of illegal gambling.
The evidence in this case clearly shows that Licensee maintained devices to be used for gambling purposes on the licensed premises.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has established that a device will be considered a gambling device per se when three elements of gambling are present, i.e.: consideration; a result determined by chance rather than skill; and a reward.
Commonwealth v. Two Electronic Poker Machines, 465 A.2d 973 (Pa. 1983).
In this case the element of consideration is clearly present on all of the machines seized since it was necessary to insert money in order to initiate play.
Similarly, the element of chance rather than skill is also present on all of the machines involved in this case.
The element of reward is established circumstantially on all of the machines in this case by the award of points or credits, the presence of a knock off device, the presence of accounting modes to determine how many points or credits were knocked off; the presence of meters duplicating the accounting modes, and the presence of dip switches to change the odds.
The appellate courts of Pennsylvania have held that the presence of these features provides sufficient evidence to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a sufficient reward is present to meet the third element of the test for a gambling device per se.
Commonwealth v. Nine Mills Mechanical Slot Machines, 437 A.2d 67 (Pa.Cmwlth 1982); Two Electronic Poker Machines (supra).
Before a determination may be made as to this count, the issue of scienter must be addressed.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has held, in those cases where the subject conduct does not directly violate the Liquor Code or intendent regulations, some element of scienter on the part of Licensee is required to endanger the liquor license.
Pa.
Liquor Control Board V. TLK, Inc., 544 A.2d 931 (Pa. 1988).
In connection with the aforementioned pronouncement, two principles were established by the court, to wit: 1.
If a Licensee knew or should have known of illegal activities of an employe or patron the licensee is liable.
2.
A licensee may defend his license by demonstrating he took substantial, affirmative steps to guard against a known pattern of illegal activities.
More than a decade ago this office indicated in Central Grill, Inc., Citation No. 87-3446, Volume III, Sel. Op. Page 187, that the nature of machines such as those involved in this case is such that they are very susceptible to use in gambling activities.
Licensee should, therefore, have taken affirmative steps to determine whether or not the machines were gambling devices per se.
Since the machines were clearly being used on the licensed premises, I find that, at the very least, Licensee should have known that gambling devices were present.
The record contains no evidence that Licensee took any attempts to prevent use of the machines or to keep the machines from being placed on the licensed premises.
Based upon the foregoing, I conclude that the Bureau has met its burden, and Count 2 of the citation is therefore sustained.
PRIOR RECORD:
Licensee has been licensed since October 13, 1998, and has had no prior violations.
Licensee is, therefore, entitled to be treated as a first time offender.

Under the circumstances of this case, the penalty imposed shall be as follows: Count 1 - $600.00 fine Count 2 - $500.00 fine
