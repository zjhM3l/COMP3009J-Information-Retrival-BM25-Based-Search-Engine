WHEREAS, Sections 1-3-410 through 1-3-460, as well as Section 25-1-440, confer upon the Governor extraordinary powers to take measures necessary to maintain peace and order; and
WHEREAS, high water on the Waccamaw River and its tributaries resulting from Hurricane Floyd has created a danger to public safety and private property due to debris and hazardous currents; and

WHEREAS, the United States Coast Guard has closed the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway from the U.S. 501 bridge south to marker 27 at Enterprise Landing due to flooding from Hurricane Floyd.
NOW, THEREFORE, I hereby extend the prohibitions on watercraft operations imposed by Executive Order 99-53 to include the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway from the U.S. 501 bridge south to marker 27 at Enterprise Landing.
This closure applies to all vessels, recreational and commercial, with the exception of law enforcement and emergency vessels, and those persons living in residences in the affected area reachable only by water.
