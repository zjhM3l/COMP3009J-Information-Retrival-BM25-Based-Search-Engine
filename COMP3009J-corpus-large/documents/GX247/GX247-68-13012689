C. SPECIAL PROGRAMS
Special Education and Bilingual Education
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which the U.S. Congress re-authorized in 1997, mandates a free and appropriate public education for all children with disabilities.
Accommodations must be made to provide equal learning opportunities to students in special education classes and those with dyslexia, attention deficit disorder and/or hyperactivity.
IDEA was passed to protect the rights of parents and children in educational decision -making.
The law requires schools to develop an individual education plan (IEP) for every child who is served in a special education program.
The law also requires that students are served in the least restrictive environment and their educational program closely aligned to those of children not in special education.
The inclusion of students with disabilities in state and district assessment programs is another legal requirement.
An effective special education program includes: * Pre-referral intervention in regular education; * Referral to special education for evaluation; * Comprehensive, nondiscriminatory evaluation; * Initial placement through an Admission, Review and Dismissal (ARD) committee meeting; * Provision of educational services and support according to a written Individual Education Plan; * Annual program review; * Three year re-evaluation; and * Provisions for dismissal from the special education program.
KCISD is a member of the Goliad Cooperative for Special Education.
Supervisory, diagnostic, speech therapy and related services are provided by the cooperative.
A district diagnostician functions as a spokesperson and coordinator for the special education program.
Principals request service directly from the special education cooperative.
Exhibit 3-12 shows the number and percent of students and teachers in the special education program and the amount and percent of the total budget for special education services.
KCISD has the fourth highest number of students enrolled in special education when compared to peer districts.
KCISD also has the second highest number of special education teachers.
In addition, KCISD has the third highest percent of budget dedicated to special education when compared to its peer districts.

FINDING
The number of KCISD special education students exempt from the TAAS has increased between 1998-99 and 1999-2000 despite the 1999 legislation requiring the inclusion of TAAS results for special education students in district accountability ratings.
Special Education students exempted in the past are now required by law to take the TAAS or an alternative assessment.
The KCISD superintendent noted that their higher number of students in the special education program contributes to the fact that more students are exempt from the TAAS; however, the district has not specifically addressed the issue of the increase in TAAS exemptions through the ARD process.
Exhibit 3-13 presents the demographic TAAS exemption information for KCISD's special education and LEP students.
The percent in each of the special education categories increased between 1998-99 and 1999-2000.
The percent of LEP students exempt from the TAAS through the ARD process has decreased or remained constant at zero during this same time period.

*Most recent available data from TEA.
In 1998-99, the Houston ISD superintendent made the decision to test all children, regardless of their exemption status.
This bold move on the part of the Houston ISD superintendent may have appeared to be a setback for the district since their overall TAAS scores lowered; however, the district now has a more realistic picture of all students' performance.
Recommendation 17:
Test all children and use the test results to strengthen the district's curriculum and instruction.
TAAS and alternative test results will provide important data to support the development of appropriate instruction for special education students and to improve student performance.

FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
Gifted and Talented Education
KCISD defines gifted and talented students as "those students who, by virtue of outstanding mental abilities, are capable of high performance and demonstrate above-average achievement or potential in general intellectual ability and specific subject matter aptitude."
The emphasis of this program is to provide a learning environment and activities that foster the development of higher-level thinking skills, creative thinking skills, problem- solving skills and oral as well as written communication skills.
At the high school level, KCISD offers a Gifted and Talented program as Pre-Advanced Placement (Pre-AP) and Advanced Placement (AP) courses in the four core areas of mathematics, English, science and social studies.
At the junior high school, Gifted and Talented students are provided a language arts class and the opportunity to work on special class projects.
Elementary students have a pullout program that consists of a 45-minute class period at each grade level.
In addition, the Gifted and Talented teacher also visits elementary classrooms to provide enrichment activities.
Kindergarten students are served in the classroom.
KCISD has the highest number of students identified as eligible for the gifted and talented program and the greatest number of teachers employed as gifted and talented teachers compared to its peers.
KCISD also budgets more than the peer districts and the state for the gifted and talented program.
Exhibit 3-14 compares student enrollment, number and percent of teachers and the amount budgeted for gifted and talented education in KCISD, peer districts and the state.

FINDING
KCISD's process for identifying gifted and talented students does not follow the guidelines for identification according to the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.
KISD teachers, counselors, librarians, administrators, parents and students may nominate a student for participation in the program.
However, students are not properly screened by a committee once nominated.
Although a majority of KCISD teachers are trained in gifted and talented instruction, not all are trained in specific identification methodology.
The State Board of Education (SBOE) has developed a state plan for the education of gifted and talented students, available in English and Spanish that outlines "acceptable," recognized, and "exemplary" practices to follow.
The state plan for the education of gifted students suggests a methodology for identifying gifted students.
A recognized practice for student identification suggests that students be screened for services at least once a year at the elementary level and once a semester at the secondary level in specific academic areas and general intelligence using a minimum of three criteria that include both qualitative and quantitative measures.
In addition, a selection committee of at least three local district and campus educators who have received training in the nature and needs of gifted and talented students reviews information gathered during the assessment process and recommends placement for students whose data reflect that program placement is the most appropriate educational setting.
Mount Pleasant ISD conducts informational meetings with school principals regarding the gifted and talented identification process and those administrators disseminate the information to their staff.
TAGT maintains an in-depth website, www.txgifted.org, easily accessible to teachers and administrators.
Recommendation 18: Implement student identification procedures that correspond with the Texas Association of Gifted and Talented (TAGT) guidelines.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The superintendent forms a committee of Gifted and Talented (G/T) teachers to review the Texas Association of Gifted Talented (TAGT) identification procedures and those used by model districts.
October 2001 2.
The committee drafts procedures that correspond with guidelines for Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.
November 2001 3.
The committee presents the recommended procedures to the superintendent for approval.
December 2001 4.
The superintendent approves the procedures and instructs the principals for the elementary, junior and high schools to inform all teachers of the G/T identification procedures December 2001 5.
The principals monitor G/T program identification.
January 2002 and Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
At-Risk Compensatory Education
In addition to regular classroom programs, other instructional programs provide special support for students at risk of dropping out and students who are not performing on grade level.
Accelerated or compensatory education, as defined in Section 42.152 (c) of the Texas Education Code, is a program designed to improve the regular education program for students in at-risk situations.
The purpose is to raise their achievement levels and reduce the dropout rate.
To determine the appropriate accelerated or compensatory program, districts must use student performance data from the state assessment instruments and any other achievement tests administered by the district.
Based on this needs assessment, district and campus staff design the appropriate strategies and include them in the campus and/or district improvement plan.
By law, the improvement plan must include the comprehensive needs assessment, measurable performance objectives, identified strategies for student improvement, identified resources and staff, specified timelines for monitoring each strategy and evaluation criteria.
Each district is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the locally designed program.
The criteria used to identify students in at-risk situations are defined in Section 29.081 of the Texas Education Code (TEC).
The definition includes each student in grades 7-12 under 21 years of age and who has not advanced from one grade level to the next for two or more school years; has mathematics or reading skills that are two or more years below grade level; has not maintained an average equivalent of 70 on a scale of 100 in two or more courses during a semester or is not maintaining such an average in two or more courses in the current semester and is not expected to graduate within four years of the date the student began ninth grade; has not performed satisfactorily on an assessment instrument administered under Subchapter B, Chapter 39 of the TEC; or is pregnant or a parent.
The definition also includes each student in pre-Kindergarten through grade 6 who did not perform satisfactorily on a readiness test or assessment instrument administered at the beginning of the school year; did not perform satisfactorily on an assessment instrument administered under Subchapter B, Chapter 39of the TEC; is a student of limited English proficiency (LEP), as defined by the TEC Section 29.052; is sexually, physically or psychologically abused; or engages in conduct described by Section 51.03(a)of the Family Code.
Students in any grade are identified as students in at-risk situations if they are not disabled and reside in a residential placement facility in a district in which the student's parent or legal guardian does not reside.
These residential facilities include a detention facility, substance abuse treatment facility, emergency shelter, psychiatric hospital, halfway house or foster family group home.
The purpose of the compensatory education program is to improve and enhance the regular education program by increasing the achievement of students and reducing the dropout rate of students identified to be at risk.
Funding allocated under state compensatory education is based on the number of economically disadvantaged students in the district and must supplement, not replace, regular program funds.
The number of economically disadvantaged students is determined by averaging the best six months' student enrollment in the National School Lunch Program of free or reduced-priced lunches for the preceding school year.
Exhibit 3-17 indicates the operating amount budgeted for instruction in compensatory education in KCISD and shows that, with the exception of Floydada ISD, KCISD ranks fourth among its peers in the percent of budget dedicated to compensatory education.

Exhibit 3-18 shows the number of counselors and students on each campus in KCISD.
Counseling and Guidance Services
FINDING
KCISD's counselors and teachers work collaboratively to serve the district's students through scheduling and constant communication.
The elementary counselor estimates that a lot of time is spent developing healthy positive relationships with parents of the children.
The counselor often meets with teachers during their conference periods in hopes of updating the teacher on specific problems that children face.
In addition, he conducts home visits and encourages communication between teachers and parents, monitors discipline, supervises lunchroom behavior, does the intake for the gifted and talented program, tests for English proficiency and directs guidance services for students.
The middle school and high school counselors also have multiple functions.
The high school provides individualized academic, personal and career counseling.
