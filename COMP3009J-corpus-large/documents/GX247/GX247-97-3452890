ADJUDICATION
BACKGROUND:
This proceeding arises out of a citation that was issued on April 28, 1998, by the Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement of the Pennsylvania State Police (hereinafter Bureau) against International Hotel, Inc., License Number H-AP-SS-825 (hereinafter Licensee).
The citation charges Licensee with violation of Section 471 of the Liquor Code [47 P.S.Â§4-471] and Section 5513 of the Crimes Code [18 Pa.
C.S. Â§5513], in that on March 10, 1998, Licensee, by it servants, agents or employes, possessed or operated gambling devices or paraphernalia or permitted gambling or lotteries, poolselling and/or bookmaking on the licensed premises.
The investigation which gave rise to the citation began on October 1, 1997 and was completed on March 12, 1998; and notice of the violation was sent to Licensee by Certified Mail on March 24, 1998.
An evidentiary hearing was held on this matter on September 9, 1998 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Upon review of the transcript of this hearing, we make the following Findings of Fact and reach the following Conclusions of Law:
FINDINGS OF FACT :
1.
Licensee is a corporation located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and holds Hotel Liquor License Number H-AP-SS-825.
(N.T., 4)
2.
On March 10, 1998 at 2:20 p.m., Enforcement Officers West, Ceh and Cozzoli entered the licensed premises, identified themselves to the bartender on duty, and conducted a routine inspection for
video slot machines.
(N.T., 7-8, 33, 41)
3.
Enforcement Officer West went behind the bar and observed a sign stating that tickets from video slot machines could be redeemed for a T-shirt and a sweatshirt which bore the premises' name and a caricature.
(N.T., 9-10, 18-19, 37, 60, 66-68, Exhibit L-1, L-3)
4.
Licensee's bartender produced eight T-shirts and seven sweatshirts which were available as prizes.
(N.T., 9-10, 19, 50)
5.
The T-shirts cost approximately $5.00 a piece and the sweatshirts cost approximately $10.00 a piece.
(Exhibit L-1)
6.
Two hundred credits won on the video slot machines entitled the player to a ticket redeemable for one T-shirt and 400 credits entitled the player to two tickets redeemable for a sweatshirt.
(N.T. 18, 37, 50, Exhibit L-3)
7.
Enforcement officers inserted a total of $11.00 into two Dyna Cherry Master video slot machines, played them, and received two serialized tickets.
(N.T., 26-28, 33-35, 43, 45)
8.
The officers did not redeem the tickets for a T-shirt or sweatshirt, but seized them as evidence.
(N.T., 12-13, Exhibit L-3)
9.
With 200 or more credits on each video slot machine, pressing the print ticket button caused it to issue a ticket, and the credits to reduce to zero.
(N.T., 13, 33-35, 42, 46-47, 74-76, Exhibit L-3, L-4)
10.
The two video slot machines were seized, marked with evidence tape and placed in storage at a secure warehouse.
(N.T., 10, 12)
11.
On March 10, 1998 at 6:00 p.m., Officer West returned to the licensed premises, inserted $15.00 into a third video slot machine which dispensed a ticket, but did not erase the credits to zero.
(N.T., 17, 24-25, 28)
12.
On March 12, 1998, Officer West examined the two Dyna Cherry Master video slot machines and found that each accepted $1.00, $5.00, $10.00 and $20.00 bills to play, operated at five cents per credit, had a very short playing time per play, had double up features for betting more than the initial bet on each machine, contained power interrupt circuits, internal accounting for the number of points in and points knocked off, and knock-off devices, which could be activated by pressing a print ticket button located on the front panel of the machine.
(N..T., 12, 14-15,17, 24, 39)
13.
Both seized video slot machines simulated the play of a mechanical slot machine by depicting a nine grid square on the display screen which appeared to revolve with various icons of fruits, bars and bells.
(N.T., 13-14, 16, 33-34, 43-44)
14.
The minimum cost to play both seized video slot machines was eight credits or 40 cents per play.
(N.T., 14, 33)
15.
A winning play on both seized video slot machines was determined by the chance combination of fruits, bars and bells when the revolving grid patterns stopped.
N.T., 14-15, 33-34)
16.
Both seized video slot machines required no skill to play or win.
(N.T., 15, 34)
17.
The enforcement officers did not observe any gambling payoffs on any of the video slot machines, during their visits to the licensed premises.
(N.T., 20, 37, 45, 51)
CONCLUSION OF LAW:
Sustained as charged.
DISCUSSION:
Counsel for the Bureau and Licensee submitted briefs in this case.
The burden of proof is on the Commonwealth to show by a clear preponderance of the evidence that a violation of the Liquor Code occurred.
Appeal of Speranza, 416 Pa. 348, 206 A.2d 292 (1965); In Re: Omicron Enterprises, 449 A.2d 857 (Pa.
Cmwlth.
1982).
An administrative agency may base a finding on circumstantial evidence if it is substantial.
Heffelfinger v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 60 Pa.
Cmwlth.
Ct. 280, 431 A.2d 380 (1981).
The general rule is that violations of criminal laws other than the Liquor Code may constitute "sufficient cause" for the purpose of invoking penalties under Section 471 of the Liquor Code.
Pa.
Liquor Control Board v. T.L.K., Inc., 544 A.2d 931 (Pa. 1988); Primo's Bar, Inc., Liquor License Case, 48 Pa.
Commonwealth Ct. 1988, 409 A.2d 1369 (1979).
At the hearing held on the matter, Enforcement Officers West, Ceh and Cozzoli testified in detail as to their seizing two video slot machines from the licensed premises on March 10, 1998.
On March 12, 1998, Officer West examined the machines' interior components and found them to be the electronic equivalent of a mechanically operated slot machine.
Each machine operated on U.S. currency, awarded credits based on chance and not skill, and awarded serialized tickets which were redeemable for T-shirts and/or sweatshirts containing the premises' logo.
The serialized tickets could be used to account for the amount of credits erased from the machines.
(N.T., 49)
Licensee's witnesses testified that the cost of the T-shirts and sweatshirts were $5.00 and $10.00 respectively, and denied that the video slot machines were used for gambling.
This case is very similar to Citation Number 96-1821 which is currently on appeal to Commonwealth Court.
The Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas at No.
S.A. 97-894 affirmed Licensee's appeal because, in its view, the reward of articles of clothing was not sufficient as a reward to meet the Bureau's burden of proof.
The Court relied on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court case, Commonwealth v. Irwin, 535 Pa. 524, 636 A.2d 1106 (1993) which held, "a redemptive token feature is not a reward for the purposes of gambling law in this Commonwealth because the player cannot win an amount of equal or greater value than the amount placed in the machine."
Irwin at 1109.
I distinguish this administrative citation case sub judice from Irwin because Licensee's video slot machines have a double-up feature for betting more than the initial bet.
As a result, they have the ability to dispense a 200 credit ticket worth $10.00 (200 @ .05 cents) to a winning player who inserts only $1.00 to play.
The machines in Irwin had internal controls to keep the value of the prize less than the cost of playing the games needed to win.
The Court also stated that this (redemptive token feature) "does not prevent the Commonwealth from prosecuting machine owners where there is evidence that the redemptive token feature is actually being used in an impermissible manner."
Irwin at 1109.
In his brief, Licensee's attorney also raised a due process argument based on the Commonwealth v. Kratsas decision of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (Slip Opinion Criminal Division, February 27, 1997) which the Superior Court affirmed (Memorandum Opinion No. J.A33049/98 filed September 21, 1998).
However, counsel for Licensee did not present any evidence at the hearing to support his due process argument that Licensee was misled into believing that the video slot machines were legal because it had appropriate township amusement permits.
I find the two video slot machines were gambling devices per se.
As such, the citation is sustained as charged.
