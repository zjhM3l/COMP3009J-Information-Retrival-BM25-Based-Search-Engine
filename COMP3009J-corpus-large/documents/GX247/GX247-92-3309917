Department of Natural Resources Honors Marinas For Their Commitment To A Healthier, Cleaner Chesapeake Bay 2nd Annual Awards Ceremony Recognized Marinas for Pollution Control Measures ______________________________________________________________ Middle River, MD (July 11, 2000) Recognizing their commitment to clean water and a healthier, cleaner Chesapeake Bay, Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Secretary Sarah Taylor-Rogers today honored 11 Maryland marinas for becoming certified Clean Marinas.
"Today, we honor these marina owners and operators for their commitment to helping restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay," said Secretary Taylor-Rogers.
"The marinas have adopted and implemented procedures that meet rigorous pollution prevention standards established by the Maryland Clean Marina Committee and DNR."
Each marina is a notable example of how changing what we do on the land can help improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay, said Secretary Taylor-Rogers as she presented Governor's citations to each marina.
"Achieving our goal of a healthier Chesapeake Bay cannot be accomplished by government actions alone, our success will be the result of efforts made by individuals, citizens and businesses working together," said Secretary Taylor-Rogers.
"These voluntary efforts by the marina industry have helped Maryland's Clean Marina Initiative become a national model."
County Executive Dutch Ruppersberger joined Secretary Taylor-Rogers, local elected officials, environmental leaders and marina owners at the event, which was held at Parkside Marina, near Middle River.
"We are delighted that two of Baltimore County's marinas have been designated for this award.
The award reaffirms Baltimore County's commitment to improve water quality and invest in environmentally responsible programs to protect the Chesapeake Bay," said Baltimore County Executive C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger.
Following the awards ceremony, Clean Marina owners and event hosts, Fred and Faye Conrad, took the guests on a tour of Parkside Marina highlighting some of their pollution prevention measures.
Mr. and Mrs. Conrad are committed to protecting Maryland's waterways.
For example, the marina developed an oil spill response plan even though they do not offer fueling facilities or have underground fuel tanks.
"The plan simply and clearly defines what to do and who to call in case of an emergency," said Mr. Conrad.
"For example, if a fuel hose breaks within a boat and then an automatic bilge pump empties the fuel overboard, we have the equipment and knowledge to respond immediately.
We also installed a bulletin board devoted to information about clean boating practices for our customers."
"We were honored to host today's event and share messages about the Clean Marina Initiative," said Mrs. Conrad.
"We enjoy working together with the program to help clean the bay and we're proud to display our Clean Marina flag.
It helps attract customers."
Recognized Clean Marinas may use the Clean Marina logo in their advertising and on their letterhead.
They also receive a flag to fly from their facility, a page on the Clean Marina web site www.dnr.state.md.us/boating, and promotion in Clean Marina publications.
The goal of the program is to certify 25 percent of Maryland's 600 marinas as Clean Marinas by 2004.
Boaters are encouraged to patronize Maryland Clean Marinas.
The Clean Marina Initiative is coordinated by DNR, in partnership with the marine industry.
The initiative promotes and celebrates voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution from marinas and recreational boats.
To achieve full standing as a certified Clean Marina, marina operators must adopt a significant proportion of the recommendations in the Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook.
The Guidebook provides a comprehensive review of pollution prevention measures.

Today's 11 honored marinas include: *
Crockett Brothers Boatyard in Oxford (Talbot County) - General Manager Philip Conner: Mr. Conner is a member of the Clean Marina Committee.
His marina invested in a new, portable structure to contain debris from maintenance operations.
Crockett Brothers is also participating in an oyster gardening program to help filter water and raise customer awareness of clean water.
Fort Washington Marina in Fort Washington (Prince George's County) - Vice President of Operations Tim Newell: Fort Washington has incorporated pollution prevention and education into training for all employees and customers at the marina.
They are also using state-of-the-art, below-ground storm water management system to reduce the flow of pollutants into nearby surface water.
Herrington Harbour North in Tracy's Landing (Anne Arundel County) - Manager Tim Wilhelm: Environmental stewardship is incorporated into all aspects of operations at Herrington Harbour.
Not only do Mr. Wilhelm and his staff ask their customers to implement pollution prevention measures, they took the extraordinary step of converting two acres of Phragmites (an invasive plant species) into a healthy marsh, filled with native plants providing significant natural resource value.
They also created a learning station overlooking the marsh to help customers and visitors understand the importance of healthy marsh systems.
Locust Point Marina in Elkton (Cecil County) - Owners Bill and Regi Descheemaeker: Locust Point Marina has constructed a special wash down pad to filter wash water run-off, and boats are carried approximately 100 feet from the water before they are pressure washed.
The special pad traps and filters the water before it is released.
Magothy Marina in Severna Park (Anne Arundel) - Manager Victoria Shiroky: A notoriously spotless marina, the Magothy Marina is renowned for its outstanding customer service.
After the marina's pump-out system broke last summer, Magothy Marina not only gave customers coupons for a free pump-out at a later date, but also encouraged them to continue to properly dispose of their sewage and directed them to the nearest working facility.
Mears Yacht Haven in Oxford (Talbot County) - General Manager Tom Gannon: Mears Yacht Haven is working hard to ensure that fuel and waste oil are handled properly at the marina.
Along with signs that are posted around the property reminding customers about proper waste disposal, they also have a spill response kit at their fuel dock in case of emergencies.
Ocean City Fishing Center in Ocean City (Worcester County) - General Manager Brad Grace: Working in cooperation with local Coast Guard Auxiliary and volunteer fire fighters, Ocean City Fishing Center provides exceptional emergency training opportunities for staff, ensuring they will be well prepared in the event of a fire or fuel spill.

They understand that being proactive is key to a successful clean and safe marina.
Each year a consultant is hired to train employees on OSHA safety and environmental standards.
[EVENT HOST] Parkside Marina in Baltimore (Baltimore County) - Owners Faye and Fred Conrad: Parkside Marina developed an oil spill response plan even though they do not offer fueling facilities or underground fuel tanks.
The plan simply and clearly defines what to do and who to call in case of an emergency.
For example, if a fuel hose breaks within a boat and then an automatic bilge pump empties the fuel overboard, the marina has the equipment and knowledge to respond immediately.
They also installed a bulletin board devoted to information about clean boating practices for customers.
Somers Cove Marina in Crisfield (Somerset County) - General Manager Jim Heller: After much hard work and dedication, Somers Cove Marina earned the distinction of becoming the first state-operated marina to become a Clean Marina.
At the facility, fishing cleaning scraps are diverted through a garbage disposal into the sanitary sewer, keeping excess nutrients out of local waters.
Young's Boatyard in Edgemere (Baltimore County) - Owner Phil Young: Young's is promoting environmental stewardship by asking customers to implement pollution prevention practices as a condition of their lease agreements.
The marina also created a poster of clean boating tips and posted it prominently on the marina grounds.
