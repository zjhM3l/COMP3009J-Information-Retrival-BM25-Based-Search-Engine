Lawrence County Mine Reclamation Projects DEP WILL FILL MINE VOIDS UNDER 146 PROPERTIES . . . . . . . .
January 10, 1997
DEP's Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation has conducted a pre-construction conference for a mine subsidence control project to begin in Neshannock Township, Lawrence County.
This project, referenced as OSM 37(2856)102.1, is intended to stabilize 146 properties located along Shenango Road, Old Plank Road, Greenfield Road, Lexington Street, Meadow Lane, Elm Drive and Greentree Circle, all situated in Neshannock Township.
Major work items under this contract include 12,100 feet of overburden drilling, 17,830 feet of air rotary drilling and 34,825 tons of a grout mixture consisting of flyash and cement.
This grout mixture will be injected underground, through drilled boreholes, to fill the underlying mine voids.
The project is scheduled to take one year and will be completed by Eles Brothers, Inc., the successful low bidder, at an estimated cost of $1.05 million.
Over the last 10 years, DEP's Ebensburg District Office has received more than 90 complaints of mine subsidence in Neshannock Township, Lawrence County, alone.
Because of the severity and frequency of mine subsidence complaints in this area, several projects have already been undertaken.
Two exploratory drilling projects were completed in 1987 to help determine the extent of mining in this area.
The first mine subsidence control project was then completed in May 1990, stabilizing 16 residences.
Since then, the BAMR has developed an area wide subsidence control plan, much of which will be addressed by the current project.
WESTERN PA COALITION FOR ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION The Western Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation was established in 1981 to provide leadership for encouraging the reclamation, development and best use of abandoned mine lands in the bituminous coal area of western Pennsylvania.
This independent, non-profit, non-partisan group supplements the efforts of the Pennsylvania Association of Conservation Districts, the Rural Abandoned Mine Program, and others with similar goals.
