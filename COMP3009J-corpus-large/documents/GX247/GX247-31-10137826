GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION
State legislation passed in 1987 requires all school districts to provide services for gifted and talented students.
In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted a state plan for serving gifted students that was designed to guide districts on how to meet the requirements of the law.
The plan also offered assurance that all students would be afforded the opportunity to be fairly and accurately assessed for the appropriate services.
In 1995, state law required the SBOE to develop and periodically update a state plan to educate gifted and talented students.
The plan was to be used for accountability purposes "to measure the performance of districts in providing services to students identified as gifted and talented."
The SBOE plan which was adopted in 1996, provides direction on refining existing services and creating additional curricular options for gifted students.

FINDING
Long-range planning and evaluation are important components of a successful gifted 
The district conducted no program evaluation last year due to the lack of a program coordinator.
Interviews and surveys identified a number of program weaknesses including training and the lack of communication about the programs.
Training for staff serving KISD's gifted and talented students is paramount to continued program success.
Decisions made at the district level, however, have resulted in fewer funds being made available for substitutes.
It is difficult to provide in-district training or to allow staff to attend workshops and other staff development activities outside the district.
In addition, opportunities with a districtwide emphasis on gifted issues are limited because most staff development in the district is planned and conducted at the school level.

The areas are student assessment, program design, curriculum and instruction, professional development, and family-community involvement.
District programs can be defined as "acceptable," recognized," or "exemplary."
Actions identified as acceptable are those included in either state law or state board Recognized and exemplary actions, while not required by the state, are included as indicators of excellence for districts desiring to offer more comprehensive services for its students.
As shown in Exhibit 2-17, KISD tied for highest in the percentage of students enrolled in gifted and talented programs among the seven peer districts and the district's percentage enrolled was higher than both the peer district and the state average.
Likewise, although the percentage of teachers assigned to gifted programs was fourth among the peer districts, it was higher than the peer district and state averages.
The percentage of instructional expenditures budgeted for gifted programs was tied for the second highest among peer districts and was significantly higher than the statewide average.
Exhibit 2-17 Percent of Students, Teachers, and Budgeted Instructional Expenditures in Gifted/Talented Programs in KISD and Peer Districts 1997-98
District G/T Student Enrollment G/T Teachers G/T Budgeted Instructional Expenditures
Killeen 8.1 2.8 3.0
Lubbock 8.1 5.6 2.8
Irving 7.6 3.6 3.0
Temple 7.5 3.2 7.8
Copperas Cove 6.0 1.1 0.9

Between 1995-96 and 1997-98, funds allocated to gifted and talented programs in KISD declined only slightly.
However, because enrollment in gifted programs has experienced a larger increase (10.9 percent) than the student enrollment in general (3.0 percent), the expenditures per student enrolled in gifted and talented programs has declined 10.2 percent, from $1,146 to $1,029.
This data is provided in Exhibit 2-18.

FINDING
The first programs for gifted and talented students in KISD were implemented in 1978.
The district operates programs for students at the elementary, middle school, and high school levels.
The elementary program consists of the Primary Able-LearnerS (PALS) program at grades K-2 and the Talented and Gifted (TAG) program at grades 3-5.
Students are served in "cluster classes," which allow for accelerated instruction in the area of identified giftedness.
Gifted Resource Rooms also are available to provide enrichment and independent study.
Middle school students are served through course offerings in the four core areas of English, math, science and social studies.
Teaching strategies and the pace and complexity of the course materials distinguishes gifted and talented courses from regular course offerings.
In grades 9-12, KISD offers identified gifted students humanities courses in English and social studies.
Advanced Placement (AP) and pre-AP classes are available in math and science and are open to all students.
Eligibility screening for KISD gifted and talented programs is ongoing.
Students, including those new to the district, are screened using multiple criteria that are grade appropriate.
For example, at the kindergarten level, the identification criteria include a portfolio assessment, a creativity test, parent inventory, teacher inventory, and an abilities test.
At the high school, the information considered includes the Stanford 9 Achievement test, previous year grades, a creativity test, parent inventory, teacher inventory, student interview, and an abilities test.
KISD provides an increased level of staffing in its gifted program.
A full-time coordinator provides districtwide coordination.
One or more Gifted Program Facilitators serve elementary schools based on the number of identified gifted and talented students at the school.
Teachers assigned to elementary cluster classes and TAG courses at the middle and high school levels have received at least 30 hours of training in gifted education.
Parent and student surveys conducted by the district toward the end of each school year provide the basis for the ongoing evaluation of the program.
Parents of students participating in all KISD programs and students in the elementary PALS and TAG programs and in all secondary gifted programs receive surveys.
Survey results are used in planning for the next school year.
Comments from interviews with parents and teachers indicate support for the program.
In the TSPR survey of teachers 86 percent agreed or strongly agreed that KISD has an effective gifted and talented program.
COMMENDATION
KISD has demonstrated a commitment to meeting the needs of its gifted and talented students and has addressed the areas of student performance contained in the state plan for educating the gifted.
FINDING
KISD has historically provided well designed programs for its gifted and talented students.
However, after the resignation in 1997-98 of the coordinator of KISD's gifted programs, the position remained vacant for more than a year and was not filled until April 1999.
In the interim, the executive director for Curriculum and Instruction assumed most of the coordinator's responsibilities.
That arrangement resulted in a number of the activities of the coordinators' office being delayed or left incomplete due to time constraints imposed on the executive director.
To help improve communication, as well as provide input on program strengths and weaknesses, the annual survey used to evaluate program effectiveness should be resumed.
In addition, the district has no five-year plan to provide long-range direction for its gifted and talented programming efforts.
Other districts' boards of trustees, such as those in Fort Bend ISD, Pasadena ISD, Sante Fe ISD, Midway ISD, and Brady ISD, have approved such plans
.
