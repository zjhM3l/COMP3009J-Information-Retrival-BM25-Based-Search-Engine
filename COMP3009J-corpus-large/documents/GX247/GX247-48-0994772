END OF SECTION
THE REMAINDER OF THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY; NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS.
This section was prepared primarily for exterior cut stone, but can be used for interior work also.
Interior work may require additional technical content for fabrication and installation (setting).
Ashlar stone veneer installed in conventional unit masonry fashion (similar to brick or concrete masonry units) should be specified in a unit masonry section.
Stone paving should be specified in Division 2 - Sitework.
Interior, natural stone flooring may be specified separately in Division 9 - Finishes.
Except when matching existing stone, specific stone and sources should be selected for each project; then this section should be modified accordingly.
Be sure listed stone suppliers' specifications do not conflict with this section.
