The best place to start is with living family members.
Collect information from your family through interviews, Bible and other family records and cemetery inscriptions.
Using this information fill in an ancestor chart with names of known ancestors.
* Record your name in space 1, your father's name in space 2 and your mother's name in space 3 using her maiden name.
Add the names of your father's parents in spaces 4 and 5 and the names of your mother's parents in spaces 6 and 7. * Record the date and place for each birth, marriage, and death known, as well as the sources of your information about each event.
* Continue to add new ancestors in the same manner as they are discovered and proven.

SEARCHING RECORDS
Continue to trace the family through vital records, census records, wills, estates records, marriage records, land records, tax records, and court records.
* Vital Records * Census Records * Other Records
Vital Records
Vital Records (births/deaths) were not kept in North Carolina on a statewide basis before October, 1913.
For most counties, microfilm indexes of births and deaths (1913- ) are available to researchers who visit the Archives Search Room.
Death certificates, 1913-1955, are in the custody of the North Carolina State Archives.
All birth certificates (1913- ) and death certificates (c 1955- ) are held by Vital Records, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Instructions for requesting copies are in the Genealogical Resources section of our Tar Heel Tracks brochure.

Census Records
Systematically find and record your ancestors and their household in censuses.
Begin with the latest available census in which your earliest proven ancestor might have appeared.
Using census indexes, systematically work backward in each preceding census, noting changes in households through the years.
Careful analysis of information determined from all the census schedules should indicate probable county of residence, household members, and neighbors of your ancestors.
* The 1920, 1910, 1900, and 1880 censuses state the relationship of each person in the household to the head of the household and can be used as substitutes for nonexistent birth certificates.
The 1890 census has been destroyed, except for a few fragments; a partial census of Union veterans survives.
* If you can determine the county and township in which your ancestor was living in the census year, read that township.
If you know only your ancestor's name, use the microfilm Miracode or Soundex indexes for 1920, 1910, 1900, and 1880 North Carolina censuses.
The 1880 index includes only households with children ten and under.
The 1870, 1860, and 1850 indexes are in book form.
Heads of households and people with a different surname are indexed; wives and children appear in the census, but not in the index.
Always look at the census, not just the index.
Use census forms; copy all information for the entire household.
The name, age, and birthplace of each person in the household, relationship to head of household (1880-1920), occupation, value/ownership of real estate and/or personal property, literacy, ownership of slaves, and neighbors identify a particular person.
They also help to distinguish two people with the same name and may give clues to other sources of information.
* Both the 1900 and 1910 censuses indicate the number of years a couple has been married.
Use this information to search the county marriage records.
Marriage licenses after 1872 should indicate the names of the parents of the bride and groom.
1870 is the first census naming all African-Americans.
To research such families thought to have been slaves, look at all their neighbors (regardless of race) for other family members and possible former owners.
For information about slaves before 1865, study the records of the slave owners: census schedules (slave and free), wills, estates records, deeds, bills of sale and any family papers which may be found in manuscript collections.
Although censuses from 1840-1790 list only heads of household by name, each of these censuses must be recorded and analyzed.
The 1840-1800 censuses are indexed.
All surviving 1790 census schedules have been published, with indexes, by state.
* Review the ages and birthplaces given for all people in the 1850 and later censuses; use this information to select the appropriate state indexes to search backwards from 1840 to 1790.
Remember that the birth date of a person remains the same; parents at one time were children.
Using census forms, record all heads of household of the surname being searched in that county or state.
Transcribe the statistics for everyone in the household, both free and slave.
Record the immediate neighbors in the same manner.

Other Records
Next proceed to the records of the county in which your ancestor lived.
Search wills and/or settlements of estates of those who may have died.
Look for marriage records of those who may have married.
Look for deeds that record your ancestor's purchases, sales or gifts of land.
Also study tax lists, court records, bonds and other county records.
Extensive research in the records of the county where your ancestors lived will help you recreate the lives of your ancestors and their families.
When each a new ancestor is proven, begin all over again, starting with the appropriate census schedules.
