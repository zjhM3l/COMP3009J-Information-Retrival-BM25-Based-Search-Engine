Professional pet assisted therapy is based on the unique bond that exists between human beings and animals.
There are numerous therapeutic applications these ties can
provide including improvement in one's self-image and sense of competence, nurturing a sense of
responsibility, expressing feelings and distress via the animal and developing one's curiosity and
motivation to learn, not to mention the endless hours of fun, warmth, learning, and love;
and WHEREAS, Many animals main goal is to love and please the humans in their lives, and often times, total strangers.
Animals frequently have the innate ability to detect emotions in
people from clues which are invisible to humans and many will instinctively comfort a person
whom they sense is in distress and in need of some extra attention; and
WHEREAS, Professionally supervised, yet casual and spontaneous interaction between
these energetic and loving animals and folks in need is a powerful tool for the therapeutic
treatment of these individuals; and
WHEREAS, Promoting public awareness for professional assisted pet therapy is an
exciting and effective pathway towards a friendlier, healthier and more peaceful world; now,
therefore be it
RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island and
Providence Plantations hereby proclaims January 8, 2004 to be "Professional Pet Assisted
Therapy Awareness Day" in the State of Rhode Island.
We urge the Governor, the Director of the
