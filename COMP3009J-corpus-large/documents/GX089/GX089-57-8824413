Controlling Exotic Species
Invasive plants are one of the most significant natural threats to preserving historic landscapes.
Non-native, exotic species often thrive in areas throughout the south.
If left unchecked, they often expand over vast areas and eventually cover, eliminate or replace the native grasses, trees and shrubs.
Kudzu is probably the most well known and widespread.
It is a rapid growing vine with no natural enemies in the United States.

A member of the legume family, Kudzu resembles soybeans or cowpeas.
Its roots can reach a depth of eight feet and have a circumference of over three inches.
Because the roots are jointed, they often branch every two or four feet and have the ability to form separate, independent plants as the root joints die.
It's one of the fastest growing plants around, with the ability to expand as much as sixty feet in one season.
Representing more fact than fiction, rumors about the growth of kudzu abound.
One of the most popular says, "if you listen, you can hear the kudzu grow."
Imported from Asia in the late 19th century, kudzu was heralded for its properties in soil conservation.
It was used in erosion control projects because of its extensive foliage and root system.
As a fast growing plant it was ideally suited for use on steep hillsides and banks.
Unfortunately, kudzu has become hard to control.
It has the ability grow over the tops of trees, shrubs, rusting cars, junkyards, powerlines and nearly anything else in its way.
It has expanded into the park from adjoining properties killing native trees and plants which normally protect the historic landscape from modern intrusions.
Efforts to control kudzu and exotic plant species require the use of environmentally safe herbicides and prescribed fire.
The park staff has implemented numerous projects using these methods.
