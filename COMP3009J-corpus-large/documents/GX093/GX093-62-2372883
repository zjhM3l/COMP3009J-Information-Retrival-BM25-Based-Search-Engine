TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ FAO PROGRESS REPORT 1995-1996 "EVALUATION OF WILD HELIANTHUS SPECIES" Author(s): SEILER GERALD J Interpretive Summary:
Sunflower is one of the few crops native to the U.S.
It is reported to have originated from the central to southwest U.S. Having the ancestors of the present day cultivated sunflower accessible within the boundaries of the U.S. allows the collection and utilization of these wild progenitors for the improvement of the cultivated sunflower.
Since there are 50 wild species with considerable genetic variability, the task of finding desirable characteristics in this diversity is difficult.
There is global interest in the utilization of the wild sunflower species to improve cultivated sunflower.
Such activities are coordinated through the Foreign Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, European System of Cooperative Research Networks in agriculture.
It is through organizations such as FAO that the sunflower industry benefits from the numerous countries which participate in the wild species network.
This divides the enormous task and has been very successful in evaluating a considerable number of wild sunflower populations for various agronomic and economic characteristics.
It is through international cooperative efforts that we will be able to make more rapid improvement of cultivated sunflower.
