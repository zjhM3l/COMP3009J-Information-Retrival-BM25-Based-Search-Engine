Summary of Evidence
Note: Separate PDQ summaries on Screening for Prostate Cancer and Prostate Cancer Treatment are also available.
Prostate cancer is associated with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and in the lifetime absence of androgenic stimulation does not develop (level of evidence: 3).
Whether hormonal manipulation at various ages will modulate risk is unknown but is under investigation.
A diet high in fat may increase prostate cancer risk (levels of evidence: 3,4,5).
Dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol and selenium may reduce risk, but studies have been inconsistent (levels of evidence: 1*,3,4,5).
Levels of Evidence
1: Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed and conducted randomized controlled trial (*in this case, secondary endpoints from randomized trials).
3: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control studies.
4: Ecologic and descriptive studies (e.g., international patterns studies, migration studies, time series).
5: Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience or reports of expert committees.

Significance
Incidence and Mortality
Carcinoma of the prostate is the most common tumor in men in the United States with 220,900 new cases and 28,900 deaths expected in 2003.[1] A wide range of estimates of the impact of the disease are notable.
The disease is histologically-evident in as many as 34% of men in their fifth decade and in up to 70% of men 80 years of age and older.[2,3] Prostate cancer will be diagnosed in almost one fifth of U.S. men during their lifetime, yet only 3% of men will be expected to die of the disease.[4]
The extraordinarily high rate of clinically occult prostate cancer in the general population compared to the 20-fold lower likelihood of death from the disease indicates that many of these cancers have low biologic risk.
Concordant with this observation are the many series of patients with prostate cancer managed by surveillance alone with relatively good survival rates at 5 and 10 years of follow-up.[6] Data demonstrate, however, that with prolonged 10-year follow-up of moderately-differentiated (which constitute the majority of tumors detected at this time [7]
Treatment options available for prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and surveillance.
A comprehensive literature review leading to development of guidelines for prostate cancer management concluded that there are no compelling data to demonstrate the clear superiority of any of these forms of treatment for an individual patient and therefore urged the presentation of all of these treatment options to any patient with newly-diagnosed, localized prostate cancer.[9] Confounding issues in the treatment of prostate cancer include side effects with treatment, inability to predict the natural history of a given cancer, patient comorbidity that may affect an individualÃ¯Â¿Â½s likelihood of surviving long enough to be at risk for disease morbidity and mortality, as well as an increasing body of evidence suggesting that careful prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring following treatment may indicate a substantial fraction of treatment failures.[10]
While both digital rectal examination and PSA screening have demonstrated reasonable performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value) for the early detection of prostate cancer, the lack of evidence that screening and treatment affects ultimate population morbidity or mortality has led many organizations to eschew screening.
The tremendous impact of prostate cancer on the U.S. population, as well as the financial burden of the disease both for patients and society, has led to an increased interest in primary disease prevention.

Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer Development
Age
It is well-established that prostate cancer incidence increases dramatically with increasing age.
While a very unusual disease in men before age 50, rates increase exponentially thereafter.
The registration rate by age cohort in England and Wales increased from 8 (per thousand population) in men 50 to 56 to 68 (per thousand) in men 60 to 64, 260 (per thousand) in men 70 to 74, and peaked at 406 (per thousand) in men 75 to 79.[1] The death rate (per thousand) in 1992 in the 50 to 54, 60 to 64, and 70 to 74 aged cohorts in this same population was 4, 37, and 166, respectively.[1]
In general, the age-related increase in prostate cancer rates parallels total cancer rates in the United States.[2]
Family History
Approximately 15% of men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer will be found to have a first-degree male relative (brother, father) with prostate cancer, compared to approximately 8% of the U.S. population.[3] It has been estimated that approximately 9% of all prostate cancers may result from heritable susceptibility genes.[4]
Hormones
The development of the prostate is dependent upon the secretion of testosterone by the fetal testis.
Testosterone causes normal virilization of the wolffian duct structures and internal genitalia and is acted upon by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase (5AR) to form dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
DHT has a 4-fold to 50-fold greater affinity for the androgen receptor than testosterone, and it is DHT that leads to normal prostatic development.
Children born with abnormal 5AR (due to a change in a single base pair in exon 5 of the normal type II 5AR gene), are born with ambiguous genitalia (variously-described as hypospadias with a blind-ending vagina to a small phallus) but masculinize at puberty due to the surge of testosterone production at that time.
Clinical, imaging, and histologic studies of kindreds born with 5AR deficiency have demonstrated a small, pancake-appearing prostate with an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and no evidence of prostatic epithelium.[8] Long-term follow-up demonstrates that neither benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) nor prostate cancer develop.
Other evidence suggesting that the degree of cumulative exposure of the prostate to androgens is related to an increased risk of prostate cancer includes: 1.
Neither BPH nor prostate cancer have been reported in men castrated prior to puberty.[9] 2.
Androgen levels generally parallel prostate cancer risk in various populations of men.
Although there are conflicting data, a number of studies have demonstrated that levels of testosterone and, especially dihydrotestosterone, are highest in black males, of intermediate levels in white males, and lowest in native Japanese.[10-12] The risks for prostate cancer in these ethnic groups directly parallel these androgen levels.
3.
Androgen deprivation in almost all forms leads to involution of the prostate, a fall in PSA levels, apoptosis of prostate cancer and epithelial cells, as well as a clinical response in prostate cancer patients.[13,14]
Race
The risk of prostate cancer is dramatically higher among blacks, is of intermediate levels among whites, and is lowest among native Japanese.
Survival is also related to ethnicity with 5-year survivals of whites with localized, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer being 94.7%, 86.6%, and 29.6%, respectively, compared to rates of 87.8%, 69.3%, and 22.7%, respectively, for blacks.[15,16] Conflicting data have been published regarding the etiology of these outcomes, but some evidence is available that access to care may play a role in disease outcomes.[17]
Dietary Fat
An interesting observation is that although the incidence of latent (occult, histologically evident) prostate cancer is similar throughout the world, clinical prostate cancer varies from country to country by as much as 20-fold.[18] Previous ecologic studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between a countryÃ¯Â¿Â½s prostate cancer-specific mortality rate and average total calories from fat consumed by the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½s population.[19,20]
Only in studies of polyunsaturated fat intake were there 3 reported studies of a significant negative association between prostate cancer and fat intake.
In general, fat of animal origin seems to be associated with the highest risk.[17,32] In a series of 384 patients with prostate cancer, the risk of cancer progression to an advanced stage was greater in men with a high fat intake.[33]
The explanation for this possible association between prostate cancer and dietary fat is unknown.
Several hypotheses have been advanced including: 1.
Dietary fat may increase serum androgen levels, thereby increasing prostate cancer risk.
This hypothesis is supported by observations from South Africa and the United States that changes in dietary fat change urinary and serum levels of androgens.[36,37] 2.
Certain types of fatty acids or their metabolites may initiate or promote prostate carcinoma development.
The evidence for this hypothesis is conflicting, but 1 study suggests that linoleic acid (omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) may stimulate prostate cancer cells while omega-3 fatty acids inhibit cell growth.[38] 3.
An observation made in an animal model is that male offspring of pregnant rats fed a high-fat diet will develop prostate cancer at a higher rate than animals fed a low-fat diet.[39] This observation may explain some of the variations in prostate cancer incidence and mortality among ethnic groups as an observation has been made that first trimester androgen levels in pregnant blacks are higher than those in whites.[40]
Diet: Fruits and Vegetables
Increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables has been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer in some studies.
One study evaluated 1619 prostate cancer cases and 1618 controls in a multicenter, multiethnic population.
The study found that intake of legumes, yellow-orange, and cruciferous vegetables was associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer.[41]
Cadmium Exposure
Cadmium exposure is occupationally seen associated with nickel-cadmium batteries and cadmium recovery plant smelters as well as in association with cigarette smoke.[42] The earliest studies of this agent documented what seemed to be an association, but better-designed studies have failed to note an association.[43,44]
Dioxin Exposure
Dioxin (TCDD or 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) is a contaminant of an herbicide used in Vietnam.
This agent is similar to many components of herbicides used in farming.
In the review of the linkage between dioxin and prostate cancer risk by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine Committee to Review the Health Effects in Vietnam Veterans of Exposure to Herbicides, only 2 articles were found on prostate cancer with sufficient numbers of cases and follow-up to allow analysis.[45,46] Their analysis of all available data suggest that the association between dioxin exposure and prostate cancer is not conclusive.[47]

Opportunities for Prevention
Hormonal Prevention
The evidence that lifetime hormonal influences may affect prostate cancer risk has led to the initiation of a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of finasteride (an inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase) to determine if this agent can reduce the incidence of prostate carcinoma.[1] The results of this study will not be available until approximately 2004.
In general, agents that are used for hormonal therapy of existing prostate cancers would be unsuitable for prostate cancer chemoprevention due to the cost and wide variety of side effects including sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, and vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes).[2] It is possible, however, that newer antiandrogens may play a role as preventive agents in the future.[3]
Dietary Prevention With a Low-Fat Diet
One study of dietary intervention over a 4-year period with reduced fat and increased consumption of fruit, vegetables, and fiber had no impact on serum PSA levels.[4] It is unknown whether dietary modification through the use of a low-fat, plant-based diet will reduce prostate cancer risk.
While this outcome is unknown, multiple additional benefits may be gleaned by such a diet to include a lower risk of hyperlipidemia, better control of blood pressure, and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease - all of which may merit adoption of such a diet.
Chemoprevention
Several agents, including alpha-tocopherol, selenium, lycopene, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO),[5-9] vitamin D,[10-12]
Based mainly on clinical trial results, alpha-tocopherol, selenium, and lycopene are receiving the greatest public health interest and are highlighted in our chemoprevention discussions below.
Chemoprevention With Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol)
In 1986, while studying the effect of adriamycin on the human prostatic cancer cell line DU-145, it was also found that alpha-tocopherol may have a possible effect.[15] The study, employing d-alpha-tocopheryl acid succinate, found that not only did it enhance the cytotoxic effect of adriamycin but also inhibited cell growth when used alone.
This inhibition was dose-dependent.
Finally, these properties were noted at doses which are routinely attained in plasma.[16] These same doses have been demonstrated to have no effect on normal mouse fibroblasts.[17,18]
A nested case-control study of serum micronutrients from a cohort of 6,860 Japanese-American men analyzed 142 confirmed cases of prostate cancer, comparing them with a similar number of controls.[20] Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the odds ratio for gamma-tocopherol was 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.3-1.5).
In a study of 2,974 male workers in Basel, Switzerland, low levels of lipid-adjusted plasma of vitamin E were associated with a statistically significantly increased risk for lung cancer.[21] Additionally, it was noted in male smokers that low levels of vitamin E were associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer.
The effect of the RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate derivative of vitamin E (vitamin E succinate - VES) on 3 metastatic human prostate cancer cell lines was studied: LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145.[22] It was found that VES inhibited cell growth and DNA synthesis in all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.
In a similar manner, the effect of dl-alpha-tocopherol in CRL-1740 prostate cancer cells was studied.[23] It was observed that even at 0.1 mM vitamin E, the prostate cancer cell line demonstrated growth suppression.
When studying tritiated-thymidine incorporation in the prostate cell line, it was found that vitamin E supplementation reduced DNA synthesis.
Additionally, analysis of high-molecular weight DNA indicated that apoptotic changes were ongoing and may have been due to vitamin E supplementation.
Not all studies of alpha-tocopherol have found the agents to be effective.
Using the DMAB-initiated rate prostate cancer model in F344 rats, the effect of 6 naturally occurring antioxidants on carcinogenesis was studied.[24] Using dietary 2 ppm selenium and 1% alpha-tocopherol, no differences were noted in atypical hyperplasia or carcinoma rates in the study groups compared with control animals.
In a large nested case-control study, serum obtained in 1974 from 25,802 persons in Washington County, Maryland was studied.[25] Serum levels of tocopherol were compared between 103 men who developed prostate cancer during 13 years of follow-up to 103 control subjects matched for age and race.
No association was found between tocopherol levels and cancer risk.
The largest assessment of the impact of alpha-tocopherol on prostate cancer risk came from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study.
This prostate cancer analysis was secondary to the ATBC studyÃ¯Â¿Â½s primary objective of assessing whether alpha-tocopherol and/or beta-carotene could reduce incidence of lung cancer in male smokers.[26] The ATBC study was prompted by multiple observations that populations with higher intakes of diets rich in alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene had a lower risk of cancer.[27,28]
The study employed a 2 x 2 factorial design, and each participant received 2 capsules.
Specifically, participants were divided into 4 similar study arms/groups: 1 receiving beta-carotene and placebo, 1 receiving alpha-tocopherol and placebo, 1 receiving both active agents, and 1 receiving 2 placebo capsules.
The form of alpha-tocopherol in this study was dl-alpha tocopherol acetate.
A total of 29,133 men were enrolled.
The daily doses of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene were 50 mg and 20 mg, respectively.
Median follow-up was 6.1 years (based on a total of 169,751 man-years).
Mean patient age was 57.2 years.
Cancers in participants were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry.
In their 1994 report,[15] the ATBC study authors concluded that 5 to 8 years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol produced no reduction and with beta-carotene produced a statistically significant increase in lung cancer incidence in male smokers.
A secondary analysis revealed that there were substantially fewer prostate cancers in participants who were randomized to receive alpha-tocopherol (99 prostate cancers) than in those who were not randomized to receive alpha-tocopherol (151 prostate cancers).
These results translate into an incidence of 11.7 cases per 10,000 person-years (with alpha-tocopherol) versus an incidence of 17.8 cases per 10,000 person-years (without alpha-tocopherol).
Recognizing that the data from the ATBC study may only apply to smokers, another study analyzed self-reported vitamin E use in smokers and nonsmokers in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.[29] While in smokers and men who had quit smoking the risk of metastatic or fatal prostate cancer was lower among men who consumed at least 100 IU of vitamin E daily, no difference in prostate cancer was seen in nonsmokers.
Two clinical trials conducted in Linxian, China,[30,31] also tested alpha-tocopherol, along with selenium (discussed below) and various other agents, in humans.
The Linxian general population trial involved approximately 30,000 subjects and had a very complicated factorial design involving various combinations of vitamins and minerals primarily to reduce the incidence and/or mortality of all cancers (not necessarily prostate cancer).
Although the trial was not positive in respect to its primary objectives, secondary analyses indicated that 1 combination, which included selenium (50 Ã‚Âµg/day in a yeast supplement), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg/day), and beta-carotene (15 mg/day), was associated with a statistically significantly lower total-mortality rate, a statistically nonsignificant 13% reduction in the all-cancer mortality rate, and a statistically significantly lower gastric cancer (cardia plus noncardia) mortality rate (a major cancer in Linxian).
A second, far smaller Linxian trial (in approximately 3,300 subjects) tested a combination of these 3 agents along with several additional vitamins and minerals (versus placebo) in preventing esophageal/gastric cardia cancer in patients with esophageal dysplasia.
The treatment arm did not reduce the cancer risk, and a statistically nonsignificant 18% increase in overall gastric (cardia and noncardia) cancer mortality occurred.
Prostate cancer mortality was not reported.
It is difficult to compare results of the 2 Linxian trials, however, because the trials differed in scale, subject characteristics, and study agents (additional agents in the latter trial may have affected the activity of selenium, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene indicated in the former trial).
It also is difficult to know how either trial would apply to the United States, with a very different (generally far lower) risk in the general population.
Chemoprevention With Selenium
Selenium is an essential trace element in humans and in other species.[32-34] A substantial volume of data suggest that supplementation with selenium reduces the risk of a variety of cancers in chemically-induced cancers,[35-53]
In a case-control study, serum samples collected in 1973 from 111 subjects who developed cancer during the subsequent 5 years were studied and compared with serum samples from 210 cancer-free subjects matched for age, race, sex, and smoking history.[61] Subjects were obtained from a cohort of 10,940 men enrolled in the Hypertension Detection Follow-up Programme.
Mean serum selenium level was lower in cancer cases (0.129 +/- SEM 0.002 Ã‚Âµg/ml) than in controls (0.136+/- 0.002 Ã‚Âµg/ml).
The association between low selenium level and cancer was strongest for gastrointestinal and prostate cancer.
The mechanism of action of selenium is not clear, but there are a number of hypotheses.
In cell cultures, it reduces the effect of a number of described mutagens [84-88] and may alter the metabolism of other carcinogens.[89-93]
A multi-institutional study designed to prevent skin cancer randomized a group of 1,312 patients with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin to either 200 Ã‚Âµg selenium per day (as selenized yeast) or placebo (nonselenized yeast).[98] Although the study began in 1983, additional funding subsequently allowed the ascertainment of rates of other cancers in the 2 study groups.
Baseline serum PSA levels in both arms were also evaluated.
This evaluation indicated that 12.4% of the selenium and 10.2% of the placebo group had prestudy serum PSAs greater than 4.0 ng/ml.
After enrollment, plasma selenium concentrations increased by approximately 67% in the selenium-treated patients.
After an average follow-up of 6.4 years, cancer incidence rates were tabulated for both groups.
The table below lists the various tumors studied, numbers of tumors in the 2 study arms, hazard ratio, and p values, which were derived from the Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status at randomization.
Selenium-treated patients experienced only about one third as many prostate tumors as did patients receiving placebo.
It is important to note that no patient experienced toxicity due to selenosis, a side effect that has been reported in association with chronic feeding of inorganic and certain organic forms of selenium at levels above 5 ppm.[99]

Other clinical trials of selenium in humans include the 2 studies conducted in Linxian, China,[30,31] that are discussed in the Chemoprevention with Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol) section.
Chemoprevention With Lycopene
Evidence exists that a diet with a high intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of cancer.
Which, if any, micronutrients may account for this reduction is unknown.
One group of nutrients often postulated as having chemoprevention properties is the carotenoids.
Lycopene is the predominant circulating carotenoid in Americans and has a number of potential activities including an antioxidant effect.[100] It is encountered in a number of vegetables, most notably tomatoes, and is best absorbed if these products are cooked and in the presence of dietary fats or oils.
The earliest studies of the association of lycopene and prostate cancer risk were generally negative before 1995 with only 1 study of 180 case-control subjects showing a reduced risk.[25,101-103] In 1995, an analysis of the PhysiciansÃ¯Â¿Â½ Health Study found a one-third reduction in prostate cancer risk in the group of men with the highest consumption of tomato products compared to the group with the lowest level of consumption, which they attributed to the lycopene content of these vegetables.[104]
