New York State Library | News | FOR RELEASE: April 27, 2001 MEDIA CONTACT: Valerie Chevrette (518) 474-5961 vchevret@mail.nysed.gov Awards from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to New York State Libraries Announced ALBANY, NY--The New York State Library announced today that 329 libraries across the state have received $16.6 million in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation U.S. Library Program.
In addition 98 other libraries received partial grants.
Working with a Public Library Leadership Coalition, the New York State Library was successful in securing a State Partnership Grant in January 1999 to bring computers and Internet technology to public libraries serving low-income communities in New York State.
The current estimated total value of the grants is $16.6 million.
"The Gates Foundation is a valuable partner in our efforts to expand access to electronic information for all New Yorkers," said Janet M. Welch, New York State Librarian.
"The Foundation provides an important first step with hardware, software, and training for New York's public libraries.
The next step is our New Century Libraries initiative to provide the electronic library collections and building renovations for on-going service to the public."
The Gates grants were awarded primarily to libraries serving communities at or above the 10 percent poverty level, as determined by a formula developed by the Gates Foundation.
Grants will purchase hardware, software, telecommunications services, training and technical assistance.
Installation of and training in the use of the new hardware and software began January 2001.
Partial grants provide computers and staff training.
Installation of and training in the use of the new hardware and software began January 2001.
Implementation of all libraries receiving grants will continue until completion of the initiative in New York in Fall, 2001.
New Century Libraries is a bill introduced by Senator Hugh Farley and Assemblywoman Naomi Matusow proposing a $95 million investment in New Yorks libraries to implement ten recommendations from the Regents Commission on Library Service.
The proposal includes: * Creating NOVEL, the New York Online Virtual Electronic Library * State matching grants for public library construction and renovation * Public school library aid to hire qualified librarians * Voluntary formation of Public Library Districts to ensure all New Yorkers have access to a local public library * Need-based State aid to public libraries in poor and high needs areas * An Urban Library Initiative for the special needs of libraries in cities * Strengthened library services for the disabled * Support for literacy programs in local libraries * Enhanced access to the collections of academic, research and special libraries * Support for conservation programs for historic and endangered documents
Formed in 1998, the Regents Commission on Library Services released its final report in July 2000 with ten recommendations for improving library services in New York State.
The Regents accepted the challenge with New Century Libraries to ensure 21^st century library services for New Yorkers in every community.
Since the inception of the Gates Library Initiative in 1997, the Foundation has awarded $100 million in grants to more than 7,000 libraries in the United States and Canada to bring Internet access to their patrons, as well as provide staff with technical assistance and training to bridge the "digital divide."
The New York State Library has served New Yorkers, state government and researchers for 180 years.
The largest state library in the nation, it is the only one to qualify for membership in the Association of Research Libraries.
The New York State Library provides leadership and support to some 7,000 libraries and library systems statewide; maintains a Talking Book and Braille Library serving more than 39,000 New Yorkers; and offers 24-hour access to a powerful online catalog through EXCELSIOR (http://www.nysl.nysed.gov).
The State Library is located on the 7^th floor of the Cultural Education Center in the Empire State Plaza in Albany, NY.
For information call 518/474-5335.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation places a major focus on helping to improve people's lives through global health and learning.
Led by William H. Gates, Sr. and Patty Stonesifer as co-chairs, the Foundation is based in Seattle.
Significant projects include the Gates Millennium Scholars program, a $50 million annual commitment for 20 years to provide financial assistance to high achieving minority students who are in severe financial need and would otherwise be excluded from higher education; the Bill and Melinda Gates Children's Vaccine Program, a $100 million commitment to speed the delivery of lifesaving vaccines to children in developing countries; and the Maternal Mortality Reduction program, a $50 million commitment to prevent pregnancy-related deaths of women in developing countries.
