I'm a Computer Scientist at the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS) working in the Computational Sciences Division of NASA Ames Research Center, researching frameworks for developing distributed applications.
Prior to coming to NASA, I worked in the research groups of Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space, IntelliCorp and Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, and on the faculty of the Computer Science Department of Indiana University, Bloomington.
I spent most of the 70s at Stanford
I am Associate Editor-in-Chief (and Editor-in-Chief designate) of IEEE Internet Computing IEEE Internet Computing logo
I'm on the Editorial Boards of JSME logo The Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution: Research and Practice and IJAIT logo The International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools
I'm the chair of the Steering Committee for the Aspect-Oriented Software Development Conference.
