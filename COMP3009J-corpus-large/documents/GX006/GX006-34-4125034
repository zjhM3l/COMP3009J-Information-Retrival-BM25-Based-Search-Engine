"We had a great woodpecker one time there that now we believe may be extinct in the United States in the Ivory Bill Woodpecker and it was collected there in the 1930's.
Unfortunately it's no longer there.
The Red Cockaded Woodpecker's still got hope.
This is another step in the right direction for managing for that very rare bird."
