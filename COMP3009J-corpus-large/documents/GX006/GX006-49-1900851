389977 DA A COMPUTER-AIDED APPROACH TO ENERGY CONTINGENCY ROUTE PLANNING FOR TRANSIT USING TNOP Friedman, TW; Janarthanan, N Transportation Research Board Transportation Research Board Special Report N203 1983 pp 65-68 5 Fig. 1 Ub. 1 Ref. SUBFILE: HRIS: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Transportation Research Board Publications Office 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington D.C. 20418 In this study the use of a computerized transit planning package is tested for analyzing the demand patters and for deriving high-per- formance plans for serving different fixed-demand levels.
The interactive graphic Transit Network Optimization System (TNOP) is a set of computer programs for use in designing and evaluating the performance of alternative bus and rail systems.
TNOP is designed to analyze fixed- route, fixed schedule transit systems.
One of several recent applications of TNOP for energy contingency planning at Seattle Metro is described in this paper.
This paper appeared in TRB Special Report 203, Proceedings of the Conference on Energy Contingency Planning in Urban Areas.
Conference was conducted by TRB and sponsored by UMTA, April 6- 9, 1983, Houston, Texas.

The objective of this study was to develop a transportation plan that would transport the 4,000 participants to the various Festival activities and provide services that would afford other athletes the opportunity to view the competition.
This report documents such a transportation plan.
It describes the routes used in transporting the participants as well as the access and parking requirements for spectators.
In addition, the report contains an evaluation of the transportation system and identifies specific problem areas that will assist future hosts in developing their transportation system for such an event.
Overall, the transportation system provided the participants with the service it was designed to provide.
The overall cost of the service was estimated at $160,000 which was nearly double the initial budget.
Factors contributing to this overrun cost are discussed in this report.
Better communication and planning was recommended to produce a more efficient and cost effective system as well as to avoid the problem areas discussed in this study.
455179 DA A RELIABILITY-BASED MODEL TO ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE AND COST OF A TRANSIT FARE COLLECTION SYSTEM Heimann, DI Transportation Systems Center Research and Special Programs Administration Cambridge Massachusetts 02142 DTS-65; Urban Mass Transportation Administration 400 7th Street, SW Washington D.C. 20590 Jun 1985 Final Rpt. 120p REPORT NO: UMTA-MA-06-0153-85-1; DOT-ISC-UMTA-84-12 SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: National Technical Information Service 5285 Port Royal Road Springfield Virginia 22161 The collection of transit system fares has become more sophisticated in recent years, with more flexible structures requiring more sophis- ticated fare collection equipment to process tickets and admit passengers.
However, this new and complex equipment has often been plagued by reliability problems, frequently resulting in significant passenger congestion and delay.
Development efforts are underway to improve reliability.
It is uncertain, however, to what extent reliability needs to be improved and how much the improvement will cost.
Attempting either too small or too large an improvement in equipment reliability or maintainability may waste valuable transit funds, and may not even solve the underlying problem.
A way is needed to determine the dependability (i.e., the passenger congestion and delay arising from the system) and cost of a fare collection system, given the passenger demand, the equipment capacity, reliability, and maintainability, and the various system costs.
This report discusses fare collection dependability analyses, and how transit systems can use it to make more effective investment decisions in selecting fare collection systems which best fit their needs, minimize costs, and provide effective service to passengers.
Software implementing such analysis is available in the form of user-friendly computer models, also described in this report.
Various types of analyses are described: evaluation (how well is the given system doing?); and trade-off analysis (what tradeoffs can be made among system values without affecting overall performance?).
The simulation and analytical models to carry out fare collection system dependability and cost analysis are presented, including their technical approach and data requirements.
Sample fare collection dependability cost analyses using data based on actual transit systems are shown, and results and conclusions are discussed.

REPORT NO: UMTA-UT-06-0001-91-1 SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Urban Mass Transportation Administration 400 7th Street, SW Washington D.C. 20590 This report presents the Agenda for the Urban Mass Transportation Administration's Transit Planning and Research (TPR) Program.
It is a response to the National Transportation Policy (NTP) issued by President Bush on February 26, 1990.
NTP calls for a new direction that will "Increase the Federal transportation budget for research and technology projects, in coordination with the efforts of private industry, the academic community, and state and local governments."
The new UMTA TPR program will integrate all of UMTAs planning and research and combine several existing programs under a single, flexible funding arrangement.
The agenda was developed to guide UMTA's TPR program.
It reflects industry's comments and suggestions at the 1990 Priorities Conference held in Kansas City, Missouri.
This agenda report consists of 2 chapters.
Chapter I (Introduction) introduces the National Transportation Policy and TPR; presents a history of UMTA Planning and Research; and discusses the Planning and Research opportunities.
Chapter 2, titled The Proposed Transit Planning and Research Agenda, puts forth and discusses the following 6 "themes" that form the framework for the NTP and serve as the basis for the TPR agenda: Maintain and expand the Nation's transportation system; Foster a sound financial base for transportation; Keep the transportation industry strong and competitive; Ensure that the transportation system supports public safety and national security; Protect the environment and the quality of life; and Advance U.S. transportation technology and expertise.
In this report, industry's proposed planning and research agenda are organized and discussed within the 6 NTP themes.

REPORT NO: NCTRP-604A SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Urban Mass Transportation Administration 400 7th Street, SW Washington D.C. 20590 This report presents the results of a study to examine advanced technologies and systems that can be applied to high occupancy, ridesharing and transit needs.
Advanced technologies can be used to encourage the use transit and rideshare facilities by improving their attractiveness and accessibility to travelers.
In addition, they have the potential to increase the efficiency of transit and rideshare operations, reducing operational costs while offering higher levels of service to the public.
Technologies were reviewed in the areas of traveler information systems, traffic management systems, fleet management and control systems, and automatic vehicle control systems.
Within these areas, developments in the U.S., Europe and Japan were considered and a number of individual technologies were identified.
The study included a review of current moves toward a national intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) program.
An outline of IVHS projects and activities directed at high occupancy vehicles, rideshare and transit vehicles has been prepared.
These cover research, development, operational testing and standard setting activities for the technologies.
The report makes recommendations for the direction of future work on transit and rideshare-related technologies, within the framework of a national IVHS program.

Manual data collection, coding and summarization is a tedious, inefficient and expensive process.
An automated data collection system such as the one produced by Multisystems, was found to be the most cost effective and versatile system for Texas small transit agencies.
The automated system consists of two software packages.
The Check*mate software is used on a portable computer to collect ridership data and the TIM software is used on a PC to correct, store and summarize the data.
The supplied documentation for the system was inadequate for implementation and so a supplemental user's guide was developed.
The automated system (including the new user's guide) was furnished to Citibus, the local transit agency in Lubbock.
The implementation and their use of the automated system was then documented.
Several comments and recommendations were generated for the automated system.
Overall, the pilot test demonstrated that the automated system could be used effectively by transit systems to improve efficiency.
The system does require considerable time to set up, and was one of the major concerns resulting from the pilot testing.
State assistance in training and set-up may be one possible alternative for small transit agencies.
TTI and Citibus personnel agree that the concept of an equipment "pool" for transit agencies to borrow the hardware necessary for an automated data collection system is not feasible due to the frequency at which data must be collected.
477590 DA AUTOMATED TRANSIT RIDERSHIP DATA COLLECTION.
FINAL REPORT Barnes, KE; Urbanik, T, II Texas Transportation Institute Texas A
Data must also be collected by those transit systems that receive Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) funding.
An automated data collection system can be used to collect, check, arrange, summarize and store bus ridership data.
The initial is more than offset by the savings in employee time after implementation.
The Check*mate and TIM software packages developed by Multisystems provides the benefits of an automated data collection system at a reasonable price.
However the documentation that is presently available is inadequate.
Implementation of this system would be extremely difficult for a novice user and additional documentation is recommended.
The centralized or pooled concept of an automated data collection system that could be made available to small transit systems in Texas was determined to be not feasible.
The influencing factor for this decision include, the logistics of providing the equipment to the transit systems, the difficulties of scheduling and communication, the cost of an adequate number of systems and the time required to train the users.
The Multisystems system does however appear to be a reasonable expenditure for individual transit systems.
The final step in evaluating the benefits of an automated system and the recommendation of this study would be to provide a small transit system with the Multisystems system, appropriate hardware and training and then evaluate its use and effectiveness.

Little, Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to test and evaluate the state-of-the-art in automatic fare collection (AFC) technology and its application to the New York City bus system, as well as the capability of such equipment to increase passenger convenience, lower fare collection costs, and reduce fare evasion.
Use of multi-ride/multi-value passes shows promise to substantially reduce revenue loss over use of monthly flash passes.
Electronic pass-reading AFC equipment from three manufacturers will be evaluated: CGA/Camp; Crouzet (magnetic ticket reader/cancellors that use the small-size Edmonson magnetic strip paper tickets); and Cubic Western Data (swipe-through pass reader using standard credit card size magnetic strip plastic fare cards).
In this project, MTA will evaluate upgraded units from these manufacturers corrected to resolve the problems identified in an earlier evaluation, as well as units from other manufacturers (such as SCI Systems, Control Systems, etc.) that have potential application.
This study will produce a final report with comparative information useful to other transit agencies considering the installation of AFC equipment on buses.

The report evaluates the Automatic Passenger Counter and Fare Demonstration Project undertaken by MARTA.
It was designed to test the merging of output data from 2 onboard devices (APC and ERF).
Three MARTA buses, equipped with both devices, were chosen to run on 3 selected routes.
Output data representing fare and passenger activities on each of the 3 routes were manually merged into a single integrated output for further analysis and report generation.
An important aspect of the initial plan, to merge the data electronically, was abandoned because of technical difficulties.
Even though an electronic merger was not possible, many project objectives were achieved.
This report provides background information of the project as a whole, discusses GFI electronic farebox and APC equipment, describes what was done, and discusses the results pointing out project strengths, weaknesses and conclusions.
Data output integration was the central theme of the entire project.

Data on the number of passengers boarding and alighting (deboarding) the bus and the location of that activity are accumulated and stored in a microprocessor on-board the bus.
These data are later transferred (either manually or automatically) to a central, stationary computer for data processing and report generation.
Prior to the development of APCs, these tasks were performed exclusively by people.
Today, many of the agencies using APC's have limited or discontinue data collection activities.
This study evaluates the capabilities, costs, and benefits of automated data collection techniques in collecting and analyzing ridership information essential to public transit planning and management.
This evaluation presents a broad range of detailed and technical information on APCs which will be a resource for agencies researching alternative data collection techniques.
In addition, the discussion on APC system implementation will benefit agencies planning a conversion from manual to automated data collection methods.

In 1985 this same bus system (renamed Metro) was recognized as one of the best systems in America.
Many factors contributed to this dramatic change--new management, new personnel, new productivity brought about by the installation of an automated management information system (MIS).
The purpose of this report is to systematically organize and share with other transit agencies Metro's experience and perception of the value of implementing these automated systems.
This report describes the process by which a multi-element MIS was installed at Houston Metro and analyzes the impact of that installation on human productivity.
The report begins with a history of mass transit events in Houston and describes the environment in which MIS was introduced.
Two tasks were undertaken.
The process analyses portion/task of this report documents the MIS implementation process and identifies problem areas and strategies addressing such problems.
The impact analyses portion measures productivity in each automated area and analyzes relationships between the automated systems and productivity.
Manual systems that were automated--vehicle maintenance, scheduling, accounting and others--and benefits derived from MIS are charted-out.
Although productivity increased substantially between 1979-1985, the study does not link these improvements solely to automated systems.
However, a plausible connection is established between the introduction of the vehicle maintenance program and the decline in the number of employees in that department.

Current information services are fragmented and do not address multi-modal trips.
A previous ConnDOT study identified the need for establishing a series of regional transportation information centers that would provide multi-modal transit information and ultimately link-up with private sector data.
The objective of this study is to define capital, operational, equipment and management needs for implementing a centralized public transport telephone information center serving the GBR.
The literature review conducted and discussed in this report indicated quality information services essential to an operator's marketing/public relations program.
Benefits flowing from the implementation of a telephone information center with automatic call distribution (ACD) and automated data retrieval capabilities are also discussed.
The Bridgeport Information Center, designed in this report, focuses on at least one trip end within the 6-town Bridgeport area.

REPORT NO: UMTA-MA-06-0152-86-3; DOT-TSC-UMTA-86-13 SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: National Technical Information Service 5285 Port Royal Road Springfield Virginia 22161 The Security Incident Reporting System (SIRS) is a microcomputer- based software program demonstrated at the Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC) in Minneapolis, MN. SIRS is designed to provide convenient storage, update and retrieval of security incident data.
The program utilizes data from dispatcher, bus operator, security officer, and municipal police reports.
Drawing on this data, the program produces standard reports, summarizing incident frequency, type, time, location and other attributes.
In addition, the system can be queried to provide ad hoc statistical information, and individual incident records can be retrieved for inspection.
Although SIRS was designed to meet the requirements of MTC, it has applicability to transit bus systems in general and can be modified to meet the varying input and output requirements of other transit systems.
Section 1 of this report describes the need for efficient and accurate security incident data reporting within the transit industry and discusses the role of automation in improving the reporting process.
Section 2 of the report outlines the relevant characteristics of MTC and its security department.
Section 3 details the design of the SIRS system and the functions it can perform.
Lastly, Section 4 describes the applicability of SIRS to the transit industry in general and recommends future efforts to promote the use of automated reporting systems like SIRS.

Potential bus users obtain this information by calling telephone numbers assigned to specific bus stops or groups of stops.
UTAs bus dispatchers have access both to the CRIS system and to the existing dispatch/communications system which includes radios on each bus.
The dispatchers monitor bus drivers' reports or schedule deviations and in turn enter this information into the CRIS system.
In this way the information supplied to potential passengers who call the CRIS numbers reflects actual operating conditions.
The primary goal of the system was to increase ridership and passenger revenues by making up-to-date service information available to all potential users of the transit system.
UTA implemented this system, initially on six test routes, on February 4, 1983 under the same "Buzz- A-Bus."
This final evaluation report is based on information gathered on CRIS system impacts throughout the sixteen-month Phase I period, which included two system effectiveness tests of six months each separated by four additional months of system operations.
The final report includes a history of the system and an analysis of CRIS system usage and awareness, as well as the impacts on bus ridership and the usage of UTAs other information services.
The system's cost and benefits are studied, and its lessons for other transit agencies are described.

In recent years, it was recognized that a new generation of controls for automated transportation was needed if substantial improvements in the service, cost, and attractiveness of future transit systems were to be realized.
Therefore, the Advanced Group Rapid Transit (AGRI) Program was established to develop and demonstrate an automatic 'moving block" control system for large scale urban applications based on a computer hardware/software hierarchy, taking advantage of advances in microprocessor and minicomputer technology.
The AGRT program was structured to include design, fabrication, test of guideway, vehicle, and control system elements.
However, primary emphasis was placed on the development and demonstration of microprocessor-based control and safety systems and communications systems which would have general application in urban mass transit.
The authors point out that microprocessor-based systems offer the transit system operator the potential for significantly increased operational flexibility and system productivity, compared to conventional control and safety programs.
Advances in microprocessor technology made this application possible.
During several phases of the AGRT program over a period of several years, Otis Elevator Company, the Boeing Company, and Rohr Industries developed control system designs which met the program objectives.
This report summarizes the work accomplished by the Otis Elevator Company on advanced automated transit technology under the AGRT program.
A brief history of the program is provided along with a summary of significant technical accomplishments and findings in the area of mini and microprocessor controls, fault-tolerant computing and software development.

data collection and a combination of manual and computer processing of information.
This adds significantly to the cost and increases time required to gather and process information.
The purpose of this study was to investigate more effective and efficient methods of collecting and processing rapid transit ridership data through automated methods.
Included in this analysis was an evaluation of alternative methods, the selection of the preferred method/s, and the development of a system functional and technical specification that could be included in a bidding document.
A variety of passenger counting techniques were reviewed for applicability and summarized into 3 areas: station-mounted equipment, track-side systems, and on-train systems.
The 3 methods selected and discussed in detail as having the most potential for immediate application were: the turnstile-based system that measures passengers entering or leaving the system at individual entrances and exits; load-weighing devices that could monitor the weight of the load on the car and thus the passenger load along the route; and photographic methods that would permit manual evaluation of loads on all trains passing a point in a more efficient manner than the stationary checkers on the platform.
Additional details on the 3 systems and their implementation are included in Appendices A, B, and C of this report.
The study conclusions favored automated passenger counting methods; use of this document to solicit bids for supplying a turnkey system; and implementation of the recommendations as a demonstration system utilizing advanced technology concepts.

The 1984-85 project demonstrated APC capability by analyzing 5 WMATA routes and preparing recommendations for route improvements based on APC collected data; it did not include a formal APC accuracy evaluation.
This 1986 APC evaluation was performed to assist WMATA in determining the role of APC technology in their total data collection effort.
The 1986 project produced approximately 18,000 observed boardings/deboardings and consisted of over 400 sample trips.
This evaluation represents the largest, most thorough accuracy evaluation of APC technology ever performed.
The Urban Transportation Associates (UTA) provided APC equipment and analytic services for this APC project, namely: 3 APC units, 8 DC signpost transmitters and 1 month lease period plus preparation of WMATA's analyses.
During October 1986, 3 APC equipped WMATA buses were deployed on the Rhode Island bus line.
Experienced checkers rode selected trips on the APC equipped buses and performed standard WMATA ride checks, noting time, boardings, deboardings, and passenger load at each bus stop.
The APC system produced a corresponding listing, thus allowing a detailed analysis of manual/APC concurrence to be conducted.
Conclusions state that UTAs APC system produced a total boarding count equal to 99.7 percent of total WMATA checker boarding counts, and 98.4 percent of total WMATA checker deboarding counts.
UTAs APC system counted total boardings/deboardings as accurately as experienced WMATA checkers.
The concurrence between APC and manual counts were consistent throughout the project.

483659 DA A COMPARISON OF SOME NEW LIGHT RAIL AND AUTOMATED-GUIDEWAY SYSTEMS Fox, GD Transportation Research Board Transportation Research Board Special Report N221 1989 pp 98-1 10 5 Tab. 9 Ref. SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Transportation Research Board Publications Office 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington D.C. 20418 The past decade has seen dramatic developments in urban rail transit, particularly in the field of light rail transit (LRT).
At the same time, several proprietary automated systems have been developed and deployed, often claiming superior levels of service and cost-effective- ness.
Data are now becoming available that make it possible to check, for the first time, how well the new automated-guideway transit (AGT) systems are meeting their promoters' claims, and to compare such systems with the new conventional LRT systems.
Methodologies are presented to collect and screen performance data from different systems in a uniform manner, and examples are developed to show how these data can be used to compare modes using actual operating information to the maximum extent.
When new AGT systems are compared with new LRT systems, or when AGT and LRT are compared on identical alignments, it appears that the cost of additional maintenance and supervising staff and additional "non-staff' budget may exceed the savings that AGT systems achieve by eliminating operators.
Although the new AGT systems represent a further advance in the development of urban transit technological capabilities, and reflect great credit on those who have built and financed them, they may also contain the seeds of future problems.
Having a significantly higher construction cost per mile than LRT, urban areas with AGT will tend to have smaller rail networks than equivalent areas selecting LRT Being proprietary systems in limited use, they may experience future procurement problems, particularly if the promoter goes out of business.
Being a contemporary, high-technology product, there is also a high risk of obsolescence in future years.

The central research questions concern the development and use of alternative modes of land transportation that can substitute for traditional gasoline/diesel fuel powered motor vehicles in the 2000-2010 period.
Two of the alternative systems examined in this report, Electric/hybrid vehicles and increased mass transit, are regarded as possible substitutes for traditional motor vehicle transportation.
The remaining two technologies, improved internal combustion engines (ICE) and intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS), are seen, in their most likely variants, as potential improvements to current 1990 motor vehicle technology.
This study describes the four alternative technologies; discusses their status in terms of development and ongoing research; discusses technical and social barriers, if any, to their future adoption; and forecasts use of these technologies to move passengers and freight in the future transportation system of the United States in 200-2010.

Only accidents (177) with commercial vehicles and buses braked by compressed air were considered.
The environment in which the accident occurred with the individual groups of vehicles in the traffic (lorries, private cars, lorries with trailers, buses, motorcycles and bicycles, pedestrians) and the road behavior, and the speed during the accident are first explained.
Due to the results of the investigation, it was found that 7.1% of the accidents with ABS vehicles were avoidable.
In 87% of them, there was damage to the lorry in the primary collision.
9.9% of the commercial vehicles also suffered secondary damage.
Complete avoidability due to ABS systems could not be recorded for any pedestrian, motorcycle and bicycle accidents.

SUBFILE: HRIS; UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Transportation Research Board Publications Office 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington D.C. 20418 Today Automatic Vehicle Control (AVC) is getting a close, hard look as a feasible long-term tool to meet a variety of transportation objectives.
As the cost of congestion and accidents goes up, complex and expensive countermeasures become more realistic.
AVC has a number of potential operational benefits.
They include elimination of congestion on guideways, improved trip-time predictability, increased vehicle capacity at lower cost than conventional freeways carrying manually operated vehicles, elimination of traffic disruption from off- road incidents, reduction in right-of-way requirements for new facilities, and reduction of accidents stemming from driver error or impairment.
This paper discusses advances that have been made in AVC technology and the various concepts for automatic highways.

The committee reviewed experience in the United States with existing systems that incorporate some IVHS technology; programs under way to develop and demonstrate advanced systems in the United States, Europe, and Japan; and proposals for new U.S. programs from Mobility 2000 and from others.
It also considered alternative models for managing and implementing research and for organizing public-private cooperative efforts.
Specifically, three topics were examined.
First, the committee proposed a vision for the potential development of IVHS.
Second, the committee considered the process necessary to define a system architecture.
Finally, the committee examined issues concerning appropriate public- and private-sector roles in research and operation of IVHS and appropriate assignment of responsibilities within the public sector with reference to the system design and management issues that are likely to arise during IVHS development during the coming decade.
This report contains the committee's findings.
Its conclusions and recommendations are addressed to those organizations that would be able to act on the committee's recommendations: DOT, Congress, IVHS America, the individual state departments of transportation, and private firms in the automotive, electronics, engineering, and communications industries.

The report derives largely from a Study Mission to Japan conducted in March of 1991.
It reflects one American's perspective on what was shown in Japan, presented in Japanese publications, and learned through various personal interviews.
Sections 1 and 2 provide, respectively, an executive summary and introduction to the report.
In Sections 3 and 4, the Japanese road system and its usage are presented.
Section 5 discusses the major government agencies having jurisdictional authority in areas that may be impacted by IVHS.
In Section 6, the rather advanced state of traffic management in Japan is presented.
This matter is highly significant to IVHS implementation since the traffic management system constitutes a basic building block for IVHS infrastructure.
Section 7 begins the immediate discussion of IVHS developments in Japan.
It outlines certain additional organizations which have been created to foster collaborative projects and discusses each of the projects in terms of content and impact on the trajectory of the overall Japanese program.
In Section 8, observations are presented on the state of technology taking each of ten functional areas under consideration.
In Section 9, a set of miscellaneous "application issues" are addressed including, for example, tort liability, aging drivers, and financing the infrastructure.
This discussion addresses both socioeconomic and market-based subjects which will bear upon the particular form of IVHS that will be deployed in Japan.
Section 10 provides a summary view of the type of Advanced Traveler Information System that is likely to be implemented on a wide scale

SUBFILE: HRIS; UMTRIS; TRRL; IRRD AVAILABLE FROM: New South Wales Department of Transport GPO Box 1620 Sydney New South Wales Australia Though there are now many software packages that can develop urban delivery schedules, there is a reluctance on the part of those involved with the management of the transportation systems to use automatic vehicle scheduling packages.
The lack of confidence in such packages is, in part, the result of several failed implementation attempts.
These failures can often be attributed to factors such as the installation of inappropriate software and the inability to deal with industrial relations problems.
This paper describes an approach to the implementation of computerized load planning support.
This method places a great emphasis on the "human' aspects of the system implementation.

SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Transportation Research Board Publications Office 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington D.C. 20418 The Century Rail Transit Line will operate for 17 mi in the median of the Century Freeway now under construction in Los Angeles.
It will also extend initially for 3 mi on exclusive right-of-way into the large El Segundo aerospace employment center.
In 1986 the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission staff evaluated the potential of looking first at improvements short of full automation, then at the benefits of full automation based on the experience of VAL and SkyTrain.
It notes that the real benefit of full automation may come not so much from trade-offs between capital and operating costs, but from the revenue potential of frequent, all-day operation.
The paper then compares the use of automated-guideway transit vehicles with a conventional light rail vehicle modified to be fully automated.
It concludes that automating the Century Line appears to be justified, and that the use of conventional light rail vehicles modified to allow unmanned operation should be an integral part of a decision to automate.

SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Transportation Research Board Publications Office 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington D.C. 20418 The quality of vehicle routing and scheduling has a great impact on the operating cost and service quality of any paratransit service.
The difficulties associated with many-to-many trip requests, vehicle availability and capacity constraints, traffic patterns, and geographical obstacles are such that the process, when done manually, is error prone, labor intensive, and difficult to optimize.
The development of computer software that creates paratransit schedules can, in addition to addressing these problems, significantly reduce the cost of generating schedules and improve the overall efficiency of providing service.
COMSIS Corporation has developed the COMSIS Routing and Scheduling System (CRSS) to address these issues.
It uses a highway network to model point-to-point travel times that recognizes geo- graphical obstacles.
CRSS takes a set of trip requests entered by means of a paratransit management information system and generates vehicle manifests.
The program also tracks the estimated vehicle locations and remaining vehicle capacity throughout the day.
The software is processed in batch after all requests have been received.
CRSS has been implemented at a number of paratransit agencies, and comparisons have been made.
Manually generated schedules have been compared with CRSS schedules in the areas of service quality and operating cost and the results are favorable.
Areas for further development have been identified.

SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Institute for Transportation, Incorporated P.O. Box 4670, Duke Station Durham North Carolina 27706 E.S. Neumann discusses the marketability of advanced transit technology.
W Kulash proposes in his paper that the affordability of people mover systems in suburban activity centres, is determined by the intensity and characteristics of the land use in the centre.
These characteristics, in turn, are determined by decisions largely within the control of the individual site owners.
The paper identifies the land use decisions that are most important to the financial feasibility of people movers and suggests guidelines, for planning land use in suburban activity centres in a manner that enhances people mover feasibility.

They provide an efficient, safe and convenient method of transport in such places as city centres, business districts, universities, airports and amusement parks.
Being a new concept in transport, ideas for APM technology and application developed rapidly and to promote the exchange of ideas an international conference on people movers has been held in Miami.
This article describes several APMS from locations throughout the world in order to demonstrate their versatility and potential.
The systems include the Aramis System in Paris, the Flydaway-under consideration in Cardiff, Otis Shuttle Transit Systems in Florida and Austria, the Metromover in Miami, the West Berlin M-Bahn System and the Peoplemovers at Gatwick and Birmingham airports.

One major reason for the slow acceptance of this technology is the lack of consensus among the major railroads about what standards to use.
Another hurdle is the problem of integrating information collected by AVI devices with the large information systems currently in use within each railroad and across railroads.
This project attempts to overcome these major obstacles.

1201 Wilson Avenue, Downsview, Ontario, Canada M3M 1J8 This report results from a study initiated by several Ontario transit properties, together with the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) and the Canadian Urban Transit Association (CUTA).
The report assesses automatic Vehicle Location and Control (AVLC) systems, and their associated technologies, for small and medium ontario transit properties.
The purpose of the report is to provide the background information necessary for the creation of a functional specification in preparation for a series of AVLC demonstration projects at several participating Ontario transit properties.
The aim is to develop a province-wide standard that will meet the needs of the majority of properties in Ontario.
During the course of this study, user requirements were identified through a survey of participating transit properties.
The survey indicates that the introduction of AVLC systems in Ontario will significantly impact a property's operational and management practices.
Also identified are essential, desirable, and optional system requirements.
These two areas will form the basis for the development of an AVLC functional specification for Ontario.

SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Engineering Societies Library 345 East 47th Street New York New York 10017 Starting early in 1986, crewless transit trains began revenue service out of Vancouver, Canada, to southeastern suburbs.
The initial 21.4-km route, principally elevated but with segments at grade and a tunnel into the downtown area, was placed in operation well in advance of the opening of Vancouver's Expo 86, which it will serve.
Christened Skytrain, the lightweight trains feature two important innovations-- linear motors and steerable axle trucks.
Married-pair units may be operated in trains of up to 6 cars.

But Boston drivers won't benefit much from these IVHS installations if they aren't somehow interconnected: if there is a problem on one of these roads, redirecting traffic could involve the use of facilities in a number of jurisdictions -- the Metropolitan District Commission, the City of Boston, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works, the Massachusetts Port Authority and the Turnpike Authority.
This project is seeking ways to maximize the benefits of the new technologies being installed around Boston by providing linkages between them.
The first phase is to identify possible off-the-shelf technologies that could be implemented as demonstration programs, as a first step towards developing an interconnected system.
From that roster of possibilities, a few will be chosen for a test on Massachusetts facilities, and a demonstration program will be planned.
In addition, discussions are now underway with the Turnpike and Toll Authorities in Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire to determine the feasibility of a regional pilot program of automatic toll collections.

Box 211 1000 AE Amsterdam Netherlands Transport, communications and urban form cover an overlapping area of rising academic and practical concern.
This paper traces several of the many themes brought together under different professional banners, and shows how a confluence of interest is emerging.
The themes are the developments in urban planning analysis, transport and time use studies, telecommunications and industrial location, all of which contribute to the area of locational effects of improved telecommunications technology, and are affected by alterations in the nature of work and the uses made of time by individuals.
The convergence of geographical, planning, transportation and communication developments now requires explicit investigation, as the timings of technological and theoretical developments appear to coincide with the emergence of a significant need to do so.
Some of the gaps between present knowledge and expertise that need to be filed are specified.
These include the investigation of the testing and use of current land use integrated analyses for road and development assessment, investigation of the nature and characteristics of work and education which are most affected by telecommunications and computer support, development of longitudinal monitoring methods for overall urban development leading indicators, exploitation of newly- available cross-sectional household and city data sets in conjunction with historical data for longitudinal investigations and forward projections, accounting for altered family structure and activity patterns and the anticipation and assessment of probable further technological change, which can and will undermine many current long term commitments.

SUBFILE: HRIS; UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Transportation Research Board Publications Office 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington D.C. 20418 The Environmental Impact Statement for the Omni and Brickell legs of the Miami Metromover required a cost-effectiveness analysis.
As the analysis was undertaken, it became evident that the cost-effectiveness procedures usually used to analyze major regional transit improvements were not appropriate for circulation-distribution systems.
One of the primary functions of circulation-distribution systems is to change trip- making patterns usually resulting in longer trips and sometimes in increased travel times.
No provision in current cost-effectiveness procedures measures this travel impact.
The methodology also fails to consider farebox revenue and local subsidies as offsets to either local or federal "costs."
These issues, encountered during the cost- effectiveness analysis phase of the study, are described and suggestions made for modifying the procedures, so that the results of circulation- distribution system analyses are meaningful.
A comparison of the values computed using different procedures for the analysis of the Omni and Brickell legs is also presented.

SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Transportation Research Board Publications Office 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington D.C. 20418 Volumes of raw data collected using the Automatic Data Acquisition System are useless until they can be processed and transformed into meaningful reports and plots.
This is done using the data processing software.
The software has a matching algorithm that is modular in structure.
It uses a simple, systematic, and logical sequence of actions in attempting to match the recorded activities in the raw data file to actual bus stops.
The algorithm is tested, validated and justified by performing sensitivity analyses on data files resembling those obtained from the Automatic Passenger Counter experiment conducted in Roanoke Valley Metro in Virginia.
It is found that the algorithm does not change its matching process with changes in the system variables.
Thus, a robust algorithm has now been developed to do the matching accurately, removing the need for a radio signpost signal to be embedded to establish locational accuracy, consequently eliminating signpost installation and maintenance worries and costs.

SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Ken-yusha, Incorporated Hikaricho 1-45-6, Kokubunji Tokyo Japan To develop an Automatic Split-Combine (ASC) system for Shinkansen electric cars, we conceive detection of distance between two trains at intervals of 0.2 seconds.
For an on-board detecting device we examined an ultrasonic sensor and fabricated an equipment including small detectors (5 cm in diameter) using a microphone, which both transmits and receives an ultrasonic wave and a parabolic horn.
The detectors are installed on the top of the two trains, one transmitting an ultrasonic wave and measuring the distance and the other as a slave receiving it and transmitting the answer.
testing in the laboratory and on board, we have made sure the equipment is able to detect within 20 m, communicating with digital bits and it is not affected by the rain.
It measures precisely the distance between the two trains and enables a backup braking pattern to be built from a point very near to the forward train in combination with the distance measured using a wayside coil and a rotary pulse generator on the axle.

The basic idea about IVHS are by no means new but a number of converging forces have encouraged significant IVHS development in North America recently.
Based on results of a Delphi survey to project realistic future scenarios, both applied and fundamental research agenda are being formulated in a Michigan-based IVHS program to push the IVHS technologies for advanced motorist information systems and for backup vehicle controls under emergency conditions.
The scope of the research agenda includes social/human elements as well as hardware and software technological systems.
The Michigan research program is expected to contribute to the development of IVHS in North America, both technically and institutionally.

Comparisons are made among these levels in eight areas of service, safety, and dependability for line haul, grade-separated transit applications.
Attended and fully automated systems nearly eliminate the human errors of a driven system.
They also offer shorter headways, thus increasing capacity and service, allowing smaller facilities, or both.
The stopping accuracies of attended and fully automated systems allow the use of platform doors, dramatically improving platform safety.
These systems can have other benefits, such as reducing insurance premiums, minimizing operational disruptions, and providing a more pleasant waiting room environment.
The ride comfort of the two automated levels can also be improved over that of driven systems.
Fully automated transit outperforms both driven and attended systems in making schedule modifications, providing off-peak service, and managing failures.
It also offers inherent resources for creating a more efficient administration of the system.

SUBFILE: UMTRIS; TRRL; IRRD AVAILABLE FROM: Engineering Societies Library 345 East 47th Street New York New York 10017 A review is presented of the functional characteristics of commercially available electronic ticketing equipment for integrated automatic fare collection.
Consideration is given to the improvements they can make to passenger service and operating company management.
The article concentrates on rail transport, but many of the conclusions apply to other means of transport.
In particular two products of the French company Electronique Serge Dassault are described, the Mirabel system which has been installed in many stations of the French National rail network and the M6 1000 which is more sophisticated and has been designed for integration into a telematics network.
The common characteristics of both systems are listed.
These include: fare changes can be locally implemented; itineraries are stored in a data file and can be easily modified; protection against fraud; easy to connect to a distant computer allowing centralised acquisition of data and a reservation service.
The organization of the two systems is illustrated diagrammatically. basic vehicle handling could be left to outside resources; 3) driver education, given only after a license is issued, would not accelerate the licensing process and the exposure of young people to accidents.

Whereas by subsequent reconstruction of fault incidents with workshop test equipment (outside diagnosis) continuously acting faults can be detected, the automatic monitoring of control systems (self monitoring) and the recording of disturbance including their accompanying circumstances and histories (fault syndrome diagnosis) with defect sporadically disturbances as well.
The development therefore tends towards fault syndrome diagnosis which can be realized in rail vehicles by means of microcomputers.
The combination of outside diagnosis, self- diagnosis and fault syndrome diagnosis results in highly efficient diagnostic devices.
In view of the available potential further progress of fault diagnosis on rail vehicles can be expected.

Union Pacific (UP) in Denver has been experimenting with a fiber optic link between a CCTV monitor in a yard office and a camera in the lead yard.
The cable is a figure eight configuration with six optic fibers.
Two of the fibers are turned back to experiment with temperature variations over time on the performance of the transmissions capabilities.
The UP is pleased with the performance of the fiber optic systems.
The system is only using 6 Mhz out of the 400 Mhz available to the cable.
Both the overhead cable, which crosses more than a dozen tracks, and the fiber optic components have performed perfectly.
Significant advantages appear in comparing fiber optics systems with communications media that exist today such as microwave, twisted copper pairs, or coaxial cable.

One can think about this system as a kind of horizontal elevator.
This pro forma is designed to demonstrate the reasonableness of the proposition that a metropolitan area can be profitably served by an automated total transportation system, a horizontal elevator that carries freight as well as passengers, just as a vertical elevator does.
And it is designed to note that there is far more revenue that can be developed and collected from carrying the mail, moving solid wastes, delivering shipments of freight, supplies, goods of all kinds across the city, than from carrying persons during rush hours.
Too much attention has heretofore been given to too small a part of the total transportation problem.
Automated, elevated, total transportation in a light-weight exclusive guideway grid, using small vehicles, can be profitable.

Linear motor trains, Japan's next generation rail transport system, will start commercial operations at Osaka in 1990.
The 5.2 km linear train will link districts of the metropolis, facilitating public access to the 1990 Garden Exhibit.
The linear motors will only be used to propel horizontally.
Linear motors attached to the bottom of the cars drive a train horizontally by means of a magnetic force created between the motors and aluminum reaction plates set in the middle of the tracks.
Osaka's linear subway will have steel wheels shaped like a conventional subway, and have an operating speed of around 70 km/h because of the short distances between stations.
The linear cars can handle sharper curves with greater comfort.
Osaka's other innovative system is the proposed AGT (Automated Guideway transit) shuttle which will provide access to Technoport Osaka, the future high tech district.

In Detroit, all the traffic signals will have only two phases, and many will be controlling U-turn slots in a wide median.
The signals will be coordinated at all times.
Partial priority for LRVs will allow selective widening of the LRV green windows where two-way progression for LRVs cannot be provided.
The Guadalupe Corridor system will involve multi-phase vehicle-actuated traffic signals.
These signals will be coordinated at some times of the day and will run free, or uncoordinated, at other times.
Partial priority for LRVs will allow window stretching during coordinated operation, and during free operation full priority will allow an LRV phase to be inserted at any point in the variable length signal cycle.
The proposed signal systems involve the total integration of LRV control into the traffic signal controller logic.
This permits the signal controller to serve LRVs without any priority treatment when appropriate, and also allows variable degrees of LRV priority to be implemented selectively when needed.
In this way it is hoped the disruption and capacity reduction often associated with in-the-median LRT of service for LRT is provided.
It will also permit operational strategies to be fine tuned in the field and altered over time as conditions or priorities change.

SUBFILE: UNITRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Mass Transit 337 National Press Building Washington D.C. 20045 The Transit Management Information System (TRANSMIS) of Southern California Rapid Transit District is a multi-faceted computer application that ultimately will involve nearly all of the SCRTD operations.
TRANSMIS-1 is an off-the-shelf software application for vehicle management, materials management, financial management and capital-project control system.
TRANSMIS-11 covers bus system planning, scheduling, runcutting, bus operator bidding and assignments, transportation payroll and personnel information.
Ultimately TRANSMIS- II will include a model to simulate labor negotiation.
A third major element of TRANSMIS is the Computerized Customer Information System (CCIS) which ultimately covers the entire SCRTD service region.
This data base with its electronic map develops routes and alternatives with transfer points, schedule time and cost between any two travel points.
A comparable system without the electronic data bases would cost $1 million more to operate annually.
TRANSMIS-I, the vehicle and material management system, was the first to be introduced.
It was decided not to simply computerize former job processes but to utilize computers to the limits of their abilities.
SCRTD then turned the development process over to consultants.
SCRTD and its consultants chose to adopt portions of systems developed previously by Bay Area Rapid Transit, New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Chicago Transit Authority.
The result is a system that controls maintenance activities at each division while knowing what each mechanic is doing and how each bus is performing.
SCRTD estimated overall savings of $50 million from its $35 million investment in the various phases of TRANSMIS.

SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: STBS Limited One Bedford London WC2E 9PP England Automated short headway urban transportation systems were viewed in the early Seventies as a possible means of effecting radical change in the type of transit service available in cities.
However, interest has declined and government-sponsored efforts in the area have ceased.
The decline in interest was accompanied by much debate among the advocates of the various forms of transit.
However, it does not appear to reflect the potential merits and limitations of short headway systems as disclosed by analysis.
This paper provides a basis for comparing short headway systems of citywide scale with conventional transit means.
The limitations inherent in rapid rail installations are reviewed and contrasted with the performance of short headway systems.
Illustrative, large-scale guideway configurations for systems operating in the three- second headway range are defined and levels of service are dedicated using simplified heuristic methods.
A basis is provided for specification and analysis of systems conforming to realistic spatial and passenger-movement constraints.
It is concluded that automated transit systems operating in the three-second headway range remain visible candidates for large-scale installations.

REPORT NO: SP-791 SUBFILE: HRIS; UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Society of Automotive Engineers 400 Commonwealth Drive Warrendale Pennsylvania 15096 The purpose of this paper is to present specifications for rubber tired vehicles operating on a cooperative highway.
These specifications will allow control systems to be designed which could meet the require- ments of a new generation of automobiles and trucks operating on roadways which can carry more vehicles per hour.
These vehicles are to be electronically guided and controlled.
The problem is divided into two aspects: 1) lateral control and 2 longitudinal control.
Lateral control will be done by a sensor system that can "see" te road ahead and steer the vehicle toward the road and will be presented in another paper.
Longitudinal control will be the subject of this paper.
It involves keeping a series of dissimilar vehicles properly spaced while operating at high speeds.
Safe spacing must be kept as vehicles enter and exit the vehicle stream, and as disturbances occur such as hills and winds.
Sensors and a control system required to perform this task to a set of performance requirements are discussed and presented in this paper.
Obviously, there are many possible solutions to these general problems.
Presented in this paper are some solutions to the sensing and control issues which show technical feasibility.

This choice has proved successful for the complex control of metro vehicles designed for mixed adhesion and rack duty.
The automatic subsystems were programmed with the aid of the GRAFCET process description.
The individual GRAFCET; were directly displayed using computer-aided design techniques and then processed directly by the computer, which also included programming of the computer's internal stores.
Experience has shown that this control technique offers major benefits over a conventional relay-based system both in respect of the design and the testing and diagnostic capabilities because it enables stepwise monitoring of the train status along with implementing of modifications without the need for making any change to the train cabling.

Forty-three individuals attended the seminar, which was held at the National Academy of Sciences facilities in Washington, DC.
The seminar was organized by The MITRE Corporation as a follow-on to the research performed by MITRE on a NCTRP project titled: "A Modular Approach to On-Board Automatic Data Collection Systems."
This Digest summarizes the presentations and discussions at the seminar.
It was evident from the attendance and discussion at the seminar that a number of changes had taken place since the conclusion of the NCTRP research effort and, in particular, since the last formal meeting on the subject of automated data collection, a 1982 working group meeting sponsored by the Transportation Systems Center (TSC).
While the TSC meeting was attended almost exclusively by U.S. transit agencies and U.S. equipment suppliers, the NCTRP seminar attracted nearly equal numbers of U.S. and Canadian representatives, plus representatives from three foreign suppliers.
In addition, the developments at the seminar indicated not only increasing technological maturity, but also a greater emphasis on system modularity.

This research also has useful applications in the Advanced Traffic Management System component of Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems.
To achieve this goal, a two- pronged research approach is being adopted.
These are the user-optimal and system-optimal approaches.
In order to predict more realistically the effects of diverted traffic on traffic flow and the time-dynamic impacts of congestion, a dynamic traffic assignment model is being developed to assess re-routing options.
In addition, the warrants to initiate diversions using artificial intelligence are being developed to assist diversion planners in making decisions in this regard.
This research is being applied to the Northern Virginia urban area as a case study.

In the course of minimizing the staff associated with operations the following areas of passenger safety require attention: Construction and layout of station; full range of communications and monitoring equipment; installation of communications on board trains; attention to the system's appearance; security in keeping of the cash which is generated; automation should be made less intimidating for passengers by the presence of persons in authority-- ticket inspectors, mobile staff and police.
An important factor in the passenger's subjective feeling of security and a preventive measure against crime is the presence of police on regular patrols, possibly together with the transit staff, and by the use of the rapid transit system by all uniformed police officers, both on and off duty.

Dutch SUBFILE: TRRL; IRRD; HRIS; UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Werkdagcommissie PO Box 163 Drieberg-en-rijsenbuR Netherlands In this paper an evaluation is given of the first stage of the "central control of tram traffic experiment".
This experiment was carried out on Tramline One in Amsterdam by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works, the Municipal Transport Authority of Amsterdam and the Technical University of Delft.
'ne cost of experiment was borne by the Ministry of Transport.
The aim of the experiment was to improve the regularity of the trams using electronic information-and control systems.
In this first stage the apparatus and software were to be developed in conjunction with the communication system and a number of informative stop signs along the line in one direction.
During the first stage the plans were revised on the basis of experiences with the system.
Thus the system was introduced in both the inward and outward bound directions and as an extra service to passengers the stop sign carrying information about waiting time was developed.
For the drivers, however, only two informative stop signs have been put in place.
The system as it now stands consists of a central processor and ten local stations.
The central processor gets information on the location of the trams and provides the controller with an overview of the whole line with all the car locations in respect of the time-table.
If the situation should require it, action can be taken.
The drivers also are given information as to their position by the stop signs.
The control strategy applied is a system based on punctuality.
Its effectiveness is evaluated using the continuously available statistical data.
To evaluate the influence of changes on the line or new control strategies, a simulation model was developed.
This model was intended for metro-use but was adjusted for use on a tram-line.
The evaluation of the first stage concerns two aspects in particular.

Japanese REPORT NO: No. 359/IV-3 SUBFILE: EIT; UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: Engineering Societies Library 345 East 47th Street New York New York 10017 There are many places where there is no efficient transportation, though they are worried about traffic jam.
To solve this problem we studied qualities and quantities of urban transport, and located some kinds of transportation to the adequate positions in the spectral field of traffic demand.
Consequently we noticed that the construction cost is too expensive when the density of traffic is under some degree.
In order to reduce the construction cost and business expenditure, we propose a light vehicle and high frequency system.
To lower axle load, width of the car is contracted.
This means reduction of axle load, and at the same time, of carrying capacity.
So high frequency system of trains is adopted.
It will also present good service to the passengers.

This paper presents a variety of methods for obtaining position and heading of automobiles.
All of them use laser beam transmitter and receiver units.
The first method uses laser transmitter and receiver units on the vehicle and corner cubes set on the side of the roadway.
The second method uses laser scanning fan beam units on the vehicle and the corner cubes on the upper side.
The third method uses the laser beam transmitter on the side of the roadway and the receivers on the vehicle.
Experimental results for three proposed methods using automobiles show that these methods can ba applicable for accurate compensation of errors caused by dead-reckoning positioning method introduced by digital differential odometry.

Also, the output from new computer models for analyzing traffic movement need to be correlated, and the models need to be made more user friendly.
In addition, there is a need to look to the future--to determine through research how to make the best use of existing street and freeway networks.
This can be accomplished through development of advanced traffic control systems and improved motorist information systems, and through research on driver behavior as it relates to motorist acceptance and use of new traffic control and motorist information and guidance systems.
The Traffic Signal Systems Committee of the Transportation Research Board has developed this Circular of research problem statements which list and discuss specific research needs for the present and the future.
Chapter I discusses the areas that need research in advanced technology, while Chapter II describes the research needed now.

REPORT NO: NTSB/SIR-85/04 SUBFILE: UMTRIS AVAILABLE FROM: National Technical Information Service 5285 Port Royal Road Springfield Virginia 22161 Additional recommendations designed to improve fire safety in the New York City subway range from an improved fire data reporting system to a more sophisticated communications system in subway tunnels for use by the New York City Fire Department and emergency personnel.
The report covers a 7-day investigation conducted in December 1984.
The purpose was to identify safety improvements that could either prevent, or reduce, fire hazards in the system which was the site of 4,368 fires in the first 10 months of 1984.
The National Transportation Safety Board had earlier issued 12 recommendations on improved subway fire safety.
These added recommendations are directed to the New York State Public Transportation Safety Board.
NTSB said NYCTA should develop a more precise definition of a confirmed fire and should categorize track and structure fire data to more accurately reflect the hazards to the riders.
The current system is not designed to assist NYCTA senior management adequately to identify serious track and structure fire hazards.
NYCTA was also advised that its system safety department should institute an internal review process to insure that correct data are being reported to data collection systems.
Tb improve emergency communications in event of fire, NYCTA was urged to install a hardwire communications system throughout the subway with jacks at frequent intervals so firefighters could plug in telephone transceivers.
Presently Fire Department radios operate on a line-of-sight range and are incapable of transmitting or receiving effectively below ground so that firemen must be stationed at short intervals in tunnels to relay communications over portable radios.
This reduces the number of persons available to fight fires.
The phone jack system would give NYFD maximum capability to fight fires and evacuate passengers.

A series of computer driven signs along a roadway advises drivers individually, providing advice such as "speed up", "merge left", "please don't rubberneck", etc.
Sensors of general and local traffic provide input to a computer, which drives the sign arrays.
The system could be implemented immediately at modest costs, and could easily be interfaced to in-vehicle signals as these become available.

The Swiss electorate voted by a 57 percent to 43 percent majority, in favor of the "Bahn 2000" project in a referendum.
The much-discussed plan to give Switzerland far-and-away the world's most advanced public transport system became law.
By 2000, on completion of the new lines, journeys between the major centres will take just under one hour.
This will produce a "symmetrical" timetable with groups of trains meeting on the hour at the major interchanges.
The rail infrastructure is determined by the timetable; the principle is not "as fast as possible" but "as fast as necessary".
By this means journeys between any two Swiss stations will be available every hour through services than so far exist, notably in the semi-fast category.
And on some routes frequency will be every 30min, day-long.

SWEDISH REPORT NO: TFK Rapport 1985:4 SUBFILE: HRIS; UMTRIS; TRRL; IRRD AVAILABLE FROM: Swedish Transport Research Commission Grev Turegatan 12A Stockholm Sweden Public transport companies use different systems for the issue of tickets and for fare collection, but accounting for tickets sold by drivers is cumbersome.
The system used must provide for (1) fare regulation combined with use of season tickets; (2) paying of fares by passengers on boarding the bus; (3) issue of tickets containing variable information, which are difficult to forge; (4) easy accounting by driver for tickets sold.
In the proposed new system, the driver is issued by the company with a number of cards each worth e.g. Sek 500.
These are inserted by the driver into the machine and recorded one at a time.
The passenger tenders his fare and states the destination, the driver enters these data and issues the ticket.
Season tickets are checked visually, and a statistical entry is made on the machine.
The machine indicates when the number of tickets sold almost amounts to the value of the driver card, and a new card is inserted at the end of his shift, the driver can easily account for the number of tickets sold by using the information on driver cards.
Multijourney tickets and season tickets would be purchased from machines at larger stations using credit cards (to avoid use of cash for security reasons) or for cash from authorised agents.

Publications Limited Faversham House, 111 St James Road Croydon Surrey CR9 2TH England This article reports how advanced surface measurement and data communication technology now make it possible to predict road and runway temperatures accurately at long distances from a forecast centre.
Birmingham University and the Transport and Road Research Laboratory developed an Ice Prediction model, based on a heat balance equation using known thermal characteristics of the road and runway materials.
The model needs to be initialised by real-time information from the road surface, provided by remote sensors, and the prediction is based on accurate weather forecasts in 3-hourly steps.
Today, many authorities have road sensor outstations linked to their central computers by dial- up telephone lines.
The computer processes data from the outstations and produces graphical displays of the relevant parameters alongside the weather forecast information from the forecast centre.
As a result of this continual comparison, any developing forecast inaccuracies can be updated immediately and the authority can be informed.
Examples are given of successful forecasting services of this type, provided by forecasting specialist Oceanroutes to clients in the UK, USA and Brazil.

It is suggested that enhancement of travel, particularly for discretionary purposes, will offset travel reduction realised through substitution.
Were most individuals' needs to be satisfied at home through telecommunications, psychological considerations would suggest that new travel would be generated.
Business trips and the avoidance of future travel through use of telecommunications are also analysed.
It is argued that the effects on the transport system are dependent not only on the costs of communicating but also on the value of information.
In general, the substitution of travel by telecommunications is expected to be minor.
