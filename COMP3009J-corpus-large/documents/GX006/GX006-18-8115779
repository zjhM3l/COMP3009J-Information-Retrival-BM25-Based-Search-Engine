Baseball
Documentary Series
This history of America's "national pastime" examines the sport in the context of such issues as race, gender, the immigrant experience, urban, rural, and popular culture, and the meaning of leisure.
Program 1 Our Game 1st Inning, 1840s to 1900, traces baseball's rise, in one generation, from a gentlemen's hobby to a national sport played and watched by millions.
Featured are Albert Goodwill Spalding, the first baseball magnate; the game's first gambling scandal; the first attempts by women to play the game; and the first black professionals, who were hounded out of the game.
Program 2 Something Like a War 2nd Inning, 1900 to 1910, presents some of the most fascinating individuals ever to play the game: Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, and John McGraw.
Program 3 The Faith of Fifty Million People 3rd Inning, 1910 to 1920, features the Black Sox scandal, in which eight members of the Chicago White Sox took money from gamblers to throw the World Series in 1919.
Program 4 A National Heirloom 4th Inning, 1920 to 1930, focuses on Babe Ruth, the Baltimore saloon-keeper's son who became the best-known baseball player in American history.
Program 5 Shadow Ball 5th Inning, 1930 to 1940, covers baseball's desperate attempts to survive the Great Depression; the parallel world of the Negro Leagues; Babe Ruth's fading career; the rise of a new generation of stars, including Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams; and the Negro League World Series game that pitted Satchel Paige against Josh Gibson.
Program 6 The National Pastime 6th Inning, 1940 to 1950, begins with the 1941 season: Joe DiMaggio hits in fifty-six straight games; Ted Williams hits .400; and the Brooklyn Dodgers win their first pennant in twenty years.
When World War II intervenes, baseball's best players become soldiers, and on April 15, 1947, baseball is integrated, when Jackie Robinson takes the field.
Program 7 The Capital of Baseball 7th Inning, 1950 to 1960, examines the heyday of New York City baseball, where for ten straight years a local team always played in the World Series and almost always won.
In 1955 the Brooklyn Dodgers finally win their first World Series, only to be moved by their owner to a new city 3,000 miles away.
Program 8 A Whole New Ball Game 8th Inning, 1960 to 1970, unfolds against the backdrop of the turbulent 1960s, when many question the game's relevance.
Highlights include Bill Mazeroski's last inning home run that wins the 1960 World Series; the breaking of Babe Ruth's home run record by Roger Maris; and the first successful attempt by baseball players to organize into a union.
Program 9 Home 9th Inning, 1970 to present, covers the most recent history of baseball and explores the future of the game, including the rising influence of television and free agency.

Program 2 1862: A Very Bloody Affair explains how Lincoln's war to preserve the Union is transformed into a war to emancipate the slaves.
Program 3 1862: Forever Free shows how as 1862 wears on, it marks a difficult year for the Union, leading up to the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest single day of the war, and the emancipation of the slaves.
Program 4 1863: Simply Murder considers Northern opposition to the Emancipation Proclamation, the miseries of regimental life, the increasing desperation of the Confederate homefront, Lee's brilliant victory at Chancellorsville, and Grant's futile attempts to take Vicksburg by siege.
Program 5 1863: The Universe of Battle opens with an account of the Battle of Gettysburg, and goes on to describe the fall of Vicksburg, the New York draft riots, the first use of black troops, and Lincoln's Gettysburg address.
Program 6 1864: Valley of the Shadow of Death opens with a biographical comparison of Grant and Lee, recounts the battles that pitted the two generals against each other, traces Sherman's Atlanta campaign, and explores the ghastly medical practices in both North and South.
Program 7 1864: Most Hallowed Ground considers how Union victories in Mobile Bay, Atlanta, and the Shenandoah Valley tilt the 1864 election toward Lincoln, and the Confederacy's last hope for independence dies.
Program 8 1865: War is All Hell traces the decline of the Confederacy from Sherman's March to the sea through Lee's surrender at Appomattox.
Program 9 The Better Angels of Our Nature recounts Lincoln's assassination and the final days of the war, closing with a look at how the Civil War transformed the country.

George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire
Documentary
To many, George Wallace was the embodiment of racism in America.
To others, he was a champion of Southern pride and a defender of the working class.
He rose to power as the nation's best-known segregationist in the early 1960s but was later elected governor of Alabama with overwhelming black support.
A Golden Gloves fighter, he battled his way into the national spotlight and came close to deadlocking the 1968 presidential election as a third-party candidate-then was shot down by a would-be assassin on the eve of his greatest political victories.
Wallace would spend his remaining years seeking redemption for the divisiveness he had once preached and asking forgiveness from those he had scorned-but he left a conservative political legacy that continues to influence national politics today.

The Great Depression
Documentary series
Emphasizing the stories of ordinary people, this seven-part American history series examines the period between the two world wars, a time dominated by the economic depression that followed the stock market crash of 1929.
(* denotes NEH production support)
Program 1 * Job at Ford's The rise of the Ford motor company affords opportunities for thousands of workers, but is followed by the grim realities of economic crisis and tough management decisions.
Program 2 * The Road to Rock Bottom As economic collapse takes its toll on America, farmers protest; mortgages are called in by banks; robberies increase dramatically; and in the summer of 1932, the U.S. Army is called in to quell the Veterans' Bonus March on Washington DC.
Program 3 New Deal/New York As President Roosevelt presides over the creation of new federal agencies to combat the effects of the Depression, nowhere is the effect of new public works projects more apparent than in Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's New York City.
Though FDR, the American aristocrat, and LaGuardia, the son of immigrants, are unlikely partners, together they expand and redefine the role of government in people's lives.
Program 4 We Have a Plan When world famous Socialist author Upton Sinclair runs for governor of California, his platform provides an alternative to capitalism and tests the limits of the New Deal.
Ironically, one year after Sinclair's defeat, President Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act, a move that signals the beginnings of a modern welfare state.
Program 5 Mean Things Happening On tenant farms of the Arkansas Delta and in the steel factories of America's industrial heartland, men and women battle landowners and factory managers for the right to join a union.
Program 6 * To Be Somebody Hard times bring fear, which often erupts in violence and discrimination towards America's racial and ethnic minorities.
But hard times also encourage some to fight against bigotry through the courts, in Congress, and by examplethe NAACP's Walter White, African American attorney Charles Houston, heavyweight champ Joe Louis, and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
Program 7 Arsenal of Democracy As the 1930s draw to a close, Americans celebrate a dream of peace and prosperity at World Fairs in San Francisco and New York.
But with Japanese and German troops on the march, they soon discover that while the New Deal changed America forever, it is war, not government programs, that ends the Great Depression.

The Great War
Documentary
An eight-part series that reveals the impact and importance of World War I, The Great War explores the poignant, powerful, and permanent ways the war changed the lives of everyone it touched.
Episode 1 Explosion Takes a sweeping look at the conditions and events that caused the cataclysm to unfold and sheds new light on how the fuse was lit that led to the first man-made catastrophe of the twentieth century.
Episode 2 Stalemate The military believed that technical advances in weaponry would make for a quick outcome on the battlefield.
How then did modern weaponry bring about a deadly stalemate? From the beginning the war was out of hand, and new styles of warfare were producing new kinds of horror and unprecedented levels of suffering and death.
Episode 3 Total War By 1915, the conflict had spread across boundaries between continents and peoples, becoming a global wara fact grimly confirmed by the unlikely battles between Turks and Australians on the Turkish cliffs of Gallipoli.
Episode 4 Slaughter World War I gave new meaning to death on the battlefield, a breadth and horror summed up in one word: slaughter.
The Battle of Verdun became for the French what Gettysburg is for Americans.
A million men died there in only nine months.
The British offered the same unspeakable sacrifice at The Somme, where another million died, and at Passchendaele, a graveyard for half a million more.
Episode 5 Mutiny By 1917, men, armies, and nations were nearing a breaking point.
For individual soldiers, it emerged as shell shock, a personal withdrawal from an intolerable reality.
For armies, it was outright rebellion; half the French army mutinied in 1917, refusing to undertake senseless attacks.
Episode 6 Collapse At the start of 1918, the odds looked bad for the Allies.
With Russia knocked out of the war by revolution and the French Army rocked by mutiny, Germany stepped up the offensive on the Western Front.
But in 1917, President Woodrow Wilson urged the United States into the war to "make the world safe for democracy," and by 1918, five million American men were in uniform.
Episode Six relates the military and domestic factors that led to Germany's ultimate collapseand to the stage that would be set for a bitter peace.
Episode 7 Hatred and Hunger The war laid the groundwork for the Cold War between the U.S. and Russia when the Allies briefly sent their soldiers to stop the Russian Revolution.
And from the Balkans to the Middle East, the unresolved issues of the Great War were Simply rearranged.
Versailles provided no real peace, and the seeds were sown for an even more catastrophic war.
Episode 8 War Without End The final episode explores the aftermath of the war and the failed peace.
For the lost generation it spawned, the war became a war without end, one that haunted everyone.
Writers and other artists tried to create an answer, and millions searched for hope and messages from departed loved ones through Spiritualism.
In Germany, the sense of betrayal and dishonor prompted some Germans to seek revenge.
The man who rose up to lead them was Adolph Hitler.

Liberty! The American Revolution
Documentary and Dramatic Series
This six-hour series covers America's greatest political storythe history of how we became a nation.
The series spans 26 years, from 1763 to 1789, and traces the transformation of Americans from loyal subjects of the British king to revolutionaries, and finally, to citizens of an entirely new kind of country.
Episode 1 The Reluctant Revolutionaries In 1763, American colonists live in a hierarchical world of gentlemen and commoners, proud to be subjects of King George III.
With the end of the French and Indian War, America has become a land of opportunity, but the British impose a seemingly routine taxthe Stamp Act.
It creates a firestorm throughout the colonies as Americans see their liberties and their power threatened.
Episode 2 Blows Must Decide By the fall of 1774, British troops occupy Boston.
Thirteen colonies, who until now have had little in common with one another, take faltering steps to unite in reaction to this aggression.
But even after shots are fired at Lexington, there is great disagreement about what to do next.
Finally, on July 2, 1776, independence is declared.
Two days later, Congress passes The Declaration of Independence.
A fight for independence is being transformed into a political revolution.
Episode 3 The Times that Try Men's Souls Days after the Declaration of Independence is signed, an immense British force drops anchor in New York harbor, pitting the largest professional army in the world against George Washington's army of untrained volunteers.
On the day after Christmas, 1776, a desperate Washington leads his Continentals quietly across the half-frozen Delaware River, surprising a garrison of Hessian soldiers at Trenton.
Washington becomes a hero and the American Revolution goes on.
Episode 4 Oh Fatal Ambition! Congress dispatches Benjamin Franklin to France in late 1776 to request financial and military support.
Louis XVI is reluctant to back the young republic without proof it can win.
British General John Burgoyne's defeat at Saratoga is the incentive France needs to supply arms and men to the revolution in America.
Episode 5 The World Turned Upside Down How do Americans, fighting in the name of liberty, justify the institution of slavery? The British army hopes to exploit the contradiction posed by slavery in the South, but their attempt to win the south fails.
Meanwhile, France enters into the revolution.
The convergence of Washington's army and the French fleet at Yorktown traps the British army.
Two years later, The Treaty of Paris is signed, ending eight long years of fighting.
Episode 6 Are We to Be a Nation? Peace brings with it a new set of challenges: the country is bankrupt and the states find themselves squabbling with one another over many issues.
A Constitutional Convention, held only to revise the Articles of Confederation, under which the country is run, instead creates a blueprint for an entirely new system of government.

New York: A Documentary Film
Documentary Series
The series chronicles the history of the city from its beginnings in 1624 as a Dutch trading post to its preeminence today as a global center of culture and commerce.
The series draws on an unparalleled archive of paintings, prints, photographs, newsreels and motion pictures, as well as the countless men and womencelebrated and obscurewho lived in, struggled in, and built the city.
Through narratives, on-camera testimony, and a collection of first-person historical quotesfrom travelers, diarists, reporters, and New Yorkers themselvesthe series reveals the confluence of human, social, and technological forces that converged in New York to usher in the modern world.
Program 1 The Country and the City (1609-1825) Identifies the key themes that formed the spine of New Yorks history: commerce and capitalism, diversity and democracy, transformation and creativity.
This episode chronicles the arrival of the Dutch, the impact of the English and the horrors of colonial slavery, and New Yorks role in the critical years during and after the American Revolution.
The episode ends with the extraordinary burst of entrepreneurial energy that culminated in the building of the Erie Canal, which launched New York on its course to becoming the first national city in America.
Program 2 Order and Disorder (1825-1865) Already established as Americas premiere port, New York swelled into the nations greatest industrial metropolis as a massive wave of German and Irish immigration turned the city into one of the worlds most complex urban environments, bringing a host of new social problems.
The citys artists, innovators, and leadersfrom Walt Whitman to the designers of Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vauxgrapple with the citys growing conflicts, which culminate in the catastrophic Civil War Draft Riots of 1863.
Program 3 Sunshine and Shadow (1865-1898) The spotlight shines on the growth, glamour, and grief of New York during Americas giddy postwar Gilded Age.
Exploring the incomparable wealth of the robber barons and the unabashed corruption of political leaders like Tammany Hall boss William M. Tweed, this episode examines the era when the expansion of wealth and poverty built to a crescendo.
The episode ends as the city itself dramatically expands its boundaries, annexing Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island into a single massive metropolis.
Program 4 The Power and the People (1898-1914) In the new century, the extraordinary interplay of capitalism, democracy, and transformation surged to a climax.
During a single generation, more than 10 million immigrants arrived in New York.
The city itself became an even more dramatic lure with the construction of the first subways and skyscrapers.
Arising from the plight of New Yorks most exploited citizens came landmark legislation that would eventually transform the lives of all Americans.
Program 5 Cosmopolis (1914-1931) In this short but dazzling period, New York became the focal point of an extraordinary array of human and cultural energies, reaching its highest levels of urban excitement and glamour.
In just over a decade, New York gave birth to its signature skyscrapers, the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings, artistic creations such as F. Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby, George Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue, and the jazz compositions of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong.
Along the way, Harlem emerged as the undisputed capital of the African American experience, and the new media industries of advertising, radio networks, public relations, and magazines found homes in midtown Manhattan.
Program 6 The City and the World (1931-2000) The series concludes with an extraordinary overview of the last 69 years of New Yorks and Americas modern history, years that took the nation through the Depression and the New Deal; World War II; the economic and population booms of the 50s; the social revolutions of the 60s; the decay and recessions of the 70s; and the rebuilding, resurgence and re-evaluation of the 80s and 90s.
Viewed by many as the capital of the world, New York became home to the United Nations and new generations of migrating Americans and international immigrants.

Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey
Documentary
The film takes an indepth look at the life and legacy of the African American scholar and statesman Ralph Johnson Bunche (1903-1971) who, in 1949, successfully negotiated armistice agreements between Israel and its four Arab neighbors.
Despite a life of extraordinary achievements that included a Nobel Peace Prize-the first ever awarded to a person of color anywhere in the world-today Bunche is arguably one of the most overlooked public figures of the 20th century.
The pioneering contributions Bunche made to international conflict resolution, decolonization and peacekeeping at the United Nations over a period of more than two decades are the primary focus of the documentary.
The film also takes a critical look at the less well-known, but important, role he played in advancing the cause of human rights around the world and civil rights at home.
In bringing these major achievements to light, this biography begins the process of restoring Ralph Bunche to his rightful place in American and world history.

This Far By Faith: African-American Spiritual Journeys
Documentary
The tumultuous and inspirational journey of spiritual renewal and transformation is the theme of This Far by Faith, a major new television series from Blackside, Inc., producers of Eyes on the Prize, and Malcolm X: Make It Plain, and The Faith Project, Inc. an independent identity created to complete This Far by Faith.
The series presents a dramatic interpretation of the African-American religious experience in six hours of dramatic narrative storytelling.
Black religious institutions and individuals helped lead the first for the abolition of slavery, offered new political ideals and leadership during Reconstruction, provided shelter and opportunity during the years of migration, immigration, and through the Great Depression; and fueled the movement for civil rights in the middle of the twentieth century.

Ulysses S. Grant
Documentary
This multi-hour biography of Ulysses S. Grant paints a nuanced portrait of one of America's most paradoxical leaders.
The greatest hero of the Civil War, Grant was a brilliant military strategist who rose from obscurity to a rank held previously only by George Washington.
However, the strength of the Confederate resistance forced Grant into a hard war that destroyed the South and led to his being labeled "a butcher."
Propelled into the White House by his battlefield success, Grant lacked the political skills to deal with the issues of the era: reconstructing the South and managing the nation's rapidly expanding economy.
His two terms were rocked by bitter racial conflict and corruption scandals.
Seven years after leaving office, Grant was financially ruined by the collapse of an investment house in which he had placed his assets.
He spent his final days in a race against time as he battled cancer while finishing his epic war memoirs.

The West
Documentary Series
This eight-part series examines the people and events that shaped the American West, exploring the myths and realities of a nation's struggle to tame an uncharted wilderness.
Program 1 The People (to 1806) Spans the 1500s to 1806, beginning with the Europeans' arrival in the West, their conflict with native people, America's purchase of the Louisiana Territory, and Lewis and Clark's epic journey in search of the fabled Northwest Passage.
Program 2 Empire Upon the Trails (1806-1848) Covers the pivotal years when Americans began moving West in significant numbers, following the path of "Manifest Destiny," determined to make the West their own.
Program 3 The Speck of the Future (1848-1856) Begins in 1848, when James Marshall discovers gold on the American River in California, and tells the story of over 50,000 fortune seekers who swarmed into the Sierra Nevada scrambling for riches and changing the West forever.

Woodrow Wilson
Documentary
In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson led a reluctant America out of decades of isolationism into a ghastly and frightening global conflict.
In doing so he helped define the U.S. role on the world stage for the rest of the twentieth century.
It was an unlikely job for a man who started his working life as a college professor and whose political interests lay in domestic reform.
But once Wilson believed America had a responsibility to bring peace and democracy to the world, it was a mission he pursued tenaciously and one that would ultimately destroy him.
His campaign to save humanity from future wars took a devastating toll on his health, and while Wilson's closest advisors refused to publicly acknowledge his inability to perform the tasks of his office, his second wife effectively ran the country as president by proxy.
Part 1 A Passionate Man Wilson rises from a Civil War boyhood in Georgia to become president of Princeton University and an outspoken champion of progressive reform.
He is elected governor of New Jersey, then narrowly wins the Presidency, accomplishing a remarkable agenda of reform in his first two years.
Part 2 The Redemption of the World President Wilson leads American through World War I, then brokers its peace treaty.
His vision of world peace through the League of Nations is struck down at home, and his health suffers so seriously that his wife becomes de facto Chief Executive.
