TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ HOST RANGE AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SUNFLOWER MOSAIC POTYVIRUS Author(s): GULYA T J SHIEL P H FREEMAN T F JORDAN RAMON L ISAKERT T A BERGER P H Interpretive Summary:
Virus diseases of cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) or other wild species of the genus Helianthus are rare, and scientific documentation is similarly scarce.
In the US, there are only three records of wild or cultivated sunflower naturally infected by a virus.
However, Sunflower mosaic virus (SuMV) was initially observed on wild H. annuus in Austin, Texas in 1966.
In the intervening three decades, there has been no further research on this potyvirus.
Sunflower in Texas is grown either for planting seed intended for the northern Great Plains area, or as confection sunflower for U.S. and foreign consumption.
Since no other viruses have been recorded on cultivated or wild sunflower in the northern Great Plains, it is important to further characterize SuMV.
Additionally, SuMV is classified as a pathogen of quarantine significance by many countries importing sunflower from the U.S.
In 1997, wild sunflowers with mosaic symptoms were found in an abandoned sorghum field in extreme southern Texas.
In subsequent years, mosaic symptoms were observed on wild sunflower in other fields in the southern Rio Grande valley, which prompted the present detailed study.
In 1999, there were about 1.09 million hectares of sunflower in the US.
A new disease such as sunflower mosaic could be quite serious because there is no resistance to SuMV in commercial sunflower hybrids or USDA germplasm.
We report here the results of a complete study to fully characterize SuMV, including its host range, transmission, serology, and taxonomic placement as a potyvirus.
