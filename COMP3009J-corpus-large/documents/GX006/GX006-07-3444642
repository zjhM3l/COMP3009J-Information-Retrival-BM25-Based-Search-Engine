Like other scenic wonders, sea-floor and shore sights suffer from overexposure.
Droves of tourists and water-sports fans descend on and into tropical and coastal waters.
All too often they leave damage in their wake.

Coral reefs in 90 of 109 countries are being damaged by cruise- ship anchors and sewage,
by tourists breaking off chunks of coral, and by commercial harvesting for sale to tourists Ã¯Â¿Â½. photo Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dan Ham/Tony Stone Images
[G-40.thumbnail.gif] What happens when a ship drops anchor? Ã¯Â¿Â½ The anchor, which may weigh up to 5 tons, can break coral heads, like this one broken by a freighter in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the long swaying anchor chain can crush coral in its wide swing.
Just one anchoring in calm seas with no wind can do damage that will take a reef 50 years to repair.

Under Attack
Manatees had it made until motorboats moved in Ã¯Â¿Â½
Manatees spend their lives grazing on aquatic vegetation or just resting in shallow rivers and coastal waters.
They have no natural predators, but they do have "enemies."
Manatees can be mangled by powerboat propellers, crushed under large boats, or trapped and killed by canal locks or discarded "ghost" fishing gear.

Perhaps two thousand of them still live in the southeastern U.S. Ã¯Â¿Â½ photo Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jeff Foott
[G-182.thumbnail.gif] Propeller-scarred manatee, Crystal River, Florida, 1986 Researchers have identified 900 manatees with distinguishable propeller scars on their backsides Ã¯Â¿Â½.
Watercraft kill about 40 animals a year--a quarter of all manatee deaths Ã¯Â¿Â½. photo Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jeff Foott
[O-200.thumbnail.gif] Since 1978 all of Florida has been a manatee sanctuary Ã¯Â¿Â½.
Signs on manatee rivers and estuaries identify safe speeds and caution boaters to look out for manatees.

Life Preservers
Moorings may make a difference
Building moorings to tie up ships can help reduce damage to coral from anchors, particularly in localized areas of high usage such as the Florida Keys Ã¯Â¿Â½.
But moorings require regular maintenance, and are expensive to install and maintain.
Very few moorings for large vessels have been built.
[G-354.thumbnail.gif] Divers installing mooring buoy, Florida, 1989 With help from the National Marine Sanctuaries Program and the grass-roots organization Reef Relief, Greenpeace divers learn how to install a type of single-hole mooring used by boats transporting divers and snorkelers.
Reef Relief has installed more than a hundred mooring buoys in Key West.

Sanctuaries begin to save wear and tear in coastal environments
The National Marine Sanctuary Program, established in 1972, now protects and manages more than 18,500 square miles (47,915 sq km) of U.S. coastal and ocean waters.
Restricted or regulated activities include exploring for or mining oil, gas, or minerals; designating new dredge-material disposal sites and discharging other materials; building on the sea bed; and injuring or harassing marine mammals, turtles, and birds.
Scientists, fishermen, kelp harvesters, and tourists can use sanctuaries year-round.

Its diverse habitats range from rocky shores and sandy beaches to sandy sea floor and the largest and deepest underwater canyon off the continental U.S.
It also includes the largest kelp forest in the U.S. Ã¯Â¿Â½ photo Ã¯Â¿Â½ Tom Campbell _________________________________________________________________
