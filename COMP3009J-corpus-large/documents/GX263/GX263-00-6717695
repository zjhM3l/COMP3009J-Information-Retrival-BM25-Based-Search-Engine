AN ACT CONCERNING PROHIBITIONS ON TRADEMARK COUNTERFEITING.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: SECTION 1.
Legislative declaration.
(1) The general assembly finds, determines, and declares that the rapidly increasing incidence of fraudulent or counterfeit products in the stream of commerce poses a significant and growing risk to the health, safety, and economic well-being of the people of this state.
The general assembly further finds and declares that, due to the sophisticated technology now employed by those who produce forged or counterfeit versions of legitima te trademarks, logos, and other distinguishing characteristics of products that come from legitimate manufacturers, it has become virtually impossible for good-faith consumers of such products to determine whether they are genuine.
(2) The general assembly finds, determines, and declares that counterfeit products have been shown to pose particular health and safety hazards in a number of common types of products, including without limitation the following: (a) Pharmaceutical products a nd medical devices such as counterfeit ulcer medicines that resulted in internal bleeding and infections; counterfeit antibiotics that resulted in severe ear infections in some children; counterfeit intra-aortic pumps that prompted a special warning and recall by the federal food and drug administration; and counterfeit birth control pills that resulted in unwanted pregnancies and bleeding; (b) Baby formula and children's toys and apparel, including counterfeit infant formula that caused babies to become ill; counterfeit toys, manufactured outside the United States and not complying with U.S. safety standards, that caused injury and created choking hazards to small children; and counterfeit children's clothing, also not Capital letters indicate new material added to existing statutes; dashes through words indicate deletions from existing statutes and such material not part of act.
Ch. 224 Criminal Law and Procedure complying with U.S. safety standards, that can easily burst into flame; (c) Automotive and aviation parts such as counterfeit brake components that resulted in the death of a mother and child; counterfeit bolts that caused an airliner to break apart and crash; and counterfeit helicopter par ts later found to have been installed on more than six hundred helicopters in both civilian and military fleets.
(3) The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that the low risk of detection and serious prosecution enjoyed by product counterfeiters has resulted in a rapid encroachment of organized crime syndica tes into this field, leading to documented cases in which violent gangs and terrorist organizations have financed their illicit operations through profits gained by producing and selling counterfeit goods, or have used transactions in counterfeit goods as a means of laundering drug money and other proceeds of illegal activity.
(4) Therefore, the general assembly finds, determines, and declares that: (a) Current Colorado law, which punishes trademark counterfeiting as a class 2 misdemeanor, fails to sufficiently deter such activity or to provide law enforcement authorities and prosecutors with adequate resources to combat the rising influence of trademark counterfeiting; and (b) Stronger measures, including enhanced penalties and classification of the crime at a level sufficient to trigger federal involvement in serious cases, are necessary to protect the public from this threat.
