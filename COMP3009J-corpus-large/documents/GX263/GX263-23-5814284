CHAPTER 98-22 Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 358 An act relating to controlled substances; amending s. 893.13, F.S., relating to prohibitions against selling, manufacturing, or delivering, or possessing with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, controlled substances within 200 feet of the real property comprising a public housing facility; defining "real property comprising a public housing facility"; providing penalties; amending s. 921.022, F.S.; ranking such offenses on the offense severity ranking chart of the Criminal Punishment Code; providing an effective date.
WHEREAS, the Florida Supreme Court in Brown v. State, 629 So.2d 841 (Fla. 1994), held that section 893.13(1)(i), Florida Statutes, 1990 Supplement, relating to enhanced penalties for selling, manufacturing, or delivering, or possessing with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, controlled substances within 200 feet of a public housing facility, was unconstitutionally vague because the phrase "public housing facility" did not give adequate notice of what conduct was prohibited, and WHEREAS, the court noted that although the phrase was not defined in the statutory section, the term "housing project" had been defined for purposes of a similar statute in Georgia, relating to prohibitions against drug transactions within 1,000 feet of a publicly operated housing project, and WHEREAS, the court also noted that analogous language in s. 893.13(1)(e), providing for enhanced penalties for certain drug offenses that occur within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school, gave a clearer indication of the conduct prohibited, in comparison to the language of s. 893.139(1)(i), and WHEREAS, it is appropriate to deter and punish drug offenses against children or other vulnerable persons in or near housing projects with penalties equal in severity to those imposed for drug offenses against children and other victims in or near schools, NOW, THEREFORE, Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida: Section 1.
Paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 893.13, Florida Statutes, is amended, and paragraph (f) is added to said subsection, to read: 893.13 (1) (d) Except as authorized by this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance in, on, or within 200 feet of the real property comprising a public housing facility, within 200 feet of the real property comprising a public or private college, university, or other postsecondary educational institution, or within 200 feet of any public park.
