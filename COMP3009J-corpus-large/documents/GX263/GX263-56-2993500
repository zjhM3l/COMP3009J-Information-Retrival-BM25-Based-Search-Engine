GLOSSARY OF TREE TERMS Balled and burlapped (B 
All synthetic fabric (Lenomesh) should be removed from the root ball prior to planting.
True biodegradable burlap can be left around the root ball.
Caliper: Trunk caliper (trunk diameter) is measured 6 inches from the ground on trees up to and including 4 inches in caliper, and 12 inches above the ground for larger trees.
Since trunks are seldom round, the average of the largest diameter and that perpendicular to it is referred to as caliper.
Any accurate device including a diameter tape may be used to measure caliper.
Trees are placed in diameter classes in order to grade them.
For example, trees in the 2-inch class include those calipering 2 inches up to but not including 21/2 inches; those in the 21/2 -inch class include trees calipering 21/2 inches up to but not including 3 inches, and so forth.
Dominant leader: The trunk that grows up through the center of the tree and obviously dominates the rest of the branches.
A dominant leader originates from a single dominant trunk and is the topmost part of a tree.
Chlorotic: A lightness or bleaching (typically yellowing) of green color in the foliage unlike the normal color.
This indicates that the plant has not been maintained in the best of health.
Chlorotic is not to be confused with normal yellowing of foliage common on many deciduous species late in the season.
It is also not to be confused with yellowing of leaves on evergreens just prior to a new leaf flush.
Clear trunk: An industry term referring to that portion of the trunk maintained free of any branches.
The clear trunk is the lower portion of the trunk measured from the soil line up to the first major branch.
Temporary branches may exist on a clear trunk.
Conifer: Includes the genera Cryptomeria, Cuppressocyparis, Cunninghamia, Cupressus, Pinus.
Corrective pruning: Pruning which removes one or more branches or trunks to create a stronger, well-structured tree framework.
Fig. 6.
Cured trees have roots growing through the burlap.
Crown: The branches, twigs and leaves that make up the foliage portion of the tree.
Crown spread diameter: Crown spread diameter is the average of the widest branch spread and that perpendicular to it (see Fig. 5).
Fig. 5.
Add A and B together and divide by two to obtain crown spread diameter.
Cured trees: Field-grown trees that are balled and burlapped in the nursery with visible roots growing through the burlap (Fig. 6).
DBH: Diameter at breast height.
This is not an appropriate method for valuating nursery trees.
45
Fig. 7a.
Example of a weak union illustrating embedded or included bark which is squeezed between the two trunks.
Fig. 8.
Note the circling roots growing along the outside surface of the root ball.
Grade: A level of plant quality that meets minimum standards.
Grow bag: A fabric container used for growing trees in field soil.
Synthetic fabric grow bags should be removed before planting.
Included bark: Also referred to as embedded bark.
Bark between a branch and trunk or between trunks that is squeezed together in the crotch of the branch (see Fig. 7a).
This typically happens on uprightgrowing, large-diameter branches which grow at a rate which is similar to the growth rate of the trunk.
This branch will be poorly connected to the trunk and could easily break off from the trunk as the tree grows older.
Leader: That part of the trunk that extends into the top 1/4 of the tree.
Major branch: A branch that is among the largest in diameter on the tree.
Multiple leaders: Two or more trunks growing nearly parallel to each other, originating any place along the stem.
The crotch angle between them is often very narrow.
This tree defect is more serious when it occurs on the lower portion of the tree.
Nearly-equal diameter: One trunk or branch is at least 2/3 the diameter of the other.
Measure the branch diameter several inches out from the crotch beyond any swelling at the branch base.
Measure the larger branch or trunk just above the crotch.
Fig. 7b.
Example of strong branch union without embedded or included bark.
Note the dark tissue on the trunk just above the branch crotch.
This is the branch bark ridge.
Its presence above the branch indicates there is no included bark.
Espalier: Any plant that is pruned, shaped and trained against a trellis, usually in a container.
Excessively root bound: A condition of containergrown trees where there are several roots larger than 1/4 inch diameter growing on the outside edge of the root ball (see Fig. 8).
Flush cut: A pruning cut made too close to, or flush with, the trunk.
This type of cut is very detrimental to tree health and is not recommended (see Fig. 4 on page 13).
It is often difficult to determine whether a flush cut was made 2 or more years after the cut was made on a young tree.
46
Poodle: A plant that is pruned and trained into balls or other formal shapes.
Root-ball diameter: The average diameter of the widest portion of the root ball and that perpendicular to it.
This shall be measured near the top of the root ball.
Roots growing out of the container: Trees can be downgraded if roots greater than 1/5 the diameter of the trunk are growing out the bottom of the container or out of the grow bag (Fig. 9).
steps 1-5, when grading topiaries.
Trees planted as topiaries are usually maintained in that form in the landscape by regular trimming of the branches.
They are not meant to be grown out in the landscape to the natural shape or size of the plant.
The natural form is not allowed to develop (see Fig. 10).
Fig. 10.
A topiary is sheared or trimmed to a variety of shapes, including a pyramid.
Tree height: Tree height is measured from the ground to the topmost portion of the tree (see Fig. 11).
Height must be measured before pruning the tree.
On small, multitrunked trees such as crapemyrtle, Japanese ligustrum and wax-myrtle, tree height is measured to the top of the main body of the crown.
Fig. 9.
Two roots greater than 1/5 the diameter of the trunk growing out the bottom of the container.
Secondary branches: Branches originating from primary or major branches.
Sturdy in the root ball: When the trunk bends along its vertical length instead of pivoting at the base of the trunk, or moving in the root ball when the root ball of a container-grown plant can be slipped from the container with all or most of the media intact with the roots.
Temporary branches: Short branches meant to be pruned from the tree in the near future as the tree grows and produces major branches.
Topiary: A formal, man-manipulated plant form, either tree or shrub, developed and maintained by frequent clipping and shearing.
Such forms include standards, sheared pyramids, espaliers, columns, animal topiaries, large bonsai and other special shapes.
Enter the grading process at Step 6, skipping Fig. 11.
Measuring tree height.
Trunk dogleg: A significant 's' - shaped deformation in the trunk (see Fig. 12).
Fig. 12.
The angle 'A' can be no more than 30o.
The distance 'B' can be no more than the trunk diameter.
Trunk wound: A trunk injury that is open and not sealed over, or closed.
A properly executed pruning cut that is not closed over is not considered a trunk wound.
