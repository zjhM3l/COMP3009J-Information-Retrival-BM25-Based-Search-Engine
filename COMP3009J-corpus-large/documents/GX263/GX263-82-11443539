A Message from the Governor Each year, motor vehicle crashes nationally claim nearly 42,000 lives, cause millions of injuries and cost Americans more than $150 billion.
Motor vehicle crashes, however, aren't accidents.
They result from faulty decisions made by drivers.
You make some of the most important decisions before you turn the ignition key.
For example, make the decision to buckle up on every ride.
And make sure that everyone else in the vehicle is buckled up.
Be sure that children are securely placed in a child safety seat, booster seat or safety belt, depending on their age and size.
Choose not to drink or use drugs and drive.
And never ride with someone who has been drinking or using drugs.
Decisions like these can literally be life savers, reducing the risk of death and serious injury if you are involved in a crash.
I am committed to reducing the number of highway fatalities in Virginia.
But, I need your help.
Join the Department of Motor Vehicles, Virginia Department of Transportation, Virginia State Police, and local law enforcement agencies as well as many non-profit traffic safety partners in making Virginia's roads safe for everyone.
Drive smart and arrive alive.
