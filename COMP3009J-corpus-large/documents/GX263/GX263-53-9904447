Virginia Post-Attack Economic Response Task Force Report of the November 1, 2001 James S. Gilmore, III Governor
Office of the Governor
Barry E. DuVal Secretary of Commerce and Trade
Dear Governor Gilmore: It is my privilege to forward to you this report of Virginia's Post-Attack Economic Response Task Force.
This report is offered in direct response to the charge you issued through Executive Order 84 (01) for the Task Force to assess the economic impacts of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on Virginia's economy and to develop an economic response strategy.
The Virginia Post-Attack Economic Response Task Force, working through ten separate work groups organized around key economic sectors, has involved representatives from business, government, labor and public interest groups.
This report summarizes the work of the Task Force.
Specifically, the report assesses the level and nature of impacts on the state's economy, businesses and workforce, and outlines specific action steps that address the economic impacts following the terrorist attacks.
The report also identifies opportunities for investment which may stimulate overall economic recovery within affected areas of the Commonwealth.
I applaud your responsiveness to the initial recommendations of the Task Force.
Your strong advocacy for the reopening of Reagan National Airport, expediting the flow of unemployment insurance to the displaced workers and efforts to jump start the state's tourism economy have already helped to respond to some of the most immediate economic impacts.
It has been my honor to serve as Chairman of the Virginia Post-Attack Economic Response Task Force.
I trust that this report will serve as a blueprint for economic response to the September 11th terrorist attacks and help to ensure that the Commonwealth's economic prosperity continues into the future.
Sincerely,
Barry E. DuVal Secretary of Commerce and Trade

INTRODUCTION The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks led to a significant dis ruption of both the national and state economies.
As a direct result of the attacks, Virginia's economy has suffered a loss of over $1.2 billion and more than 5,000 Virginians have filed for unemployment.
But those numbers do not account for the full impact on the Commonwealth's overall economy.
While emergency response efforts and security were the immediate focus following the terrorist attacks, Governor Gilmore recognized the need to position the Commonwealth to respond to the broader adverse economic impacts.
At a press conference on September 19th at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Governor Gilmore announced the creation of the Virginia Post-Attack Economic Response Task Force.
This action was formalized through Executive Order 84 (01), which authorized the Task Force and outlined its purpose (see Appendix A).
The Task Force was charged with: 1.
Assessing the level and nature of impacts on the state's economy, business and workforce; 2.
Developing and implementing a long-term economic response strategy; 3.
Coordinating the provision of federal, state and private funding; 4.
Providing technical assistance to affected business and communities; and 5.
Serving as a catalyst for public and private community partnerships to promote economic growth.
In accordance with the Executive Order, Task Force members included representatives from business, government, labor, public interest and professional associations from across the Commonwealth.
Task Force work groups were organized around the areas of economic development, tourism, workforce, ground transportation, aviation, financial, agriculture, ports, legal services and coordination of charitable services.
The initial meeting of the Task Force on September 26, 2001 in Arlington included facilitated work sessions for each group.
Work groups were asked to identify the most critical economic
impacts resulting from the attacks and what responses could be made to mitigate those impacts.
The groups developed a summary of the impacts and possible responses identified during these work sessions.
Each work group held at least one meeting subsequent to the ini tial full Task Force meeting and several held public hearings at various locations around the state.
The work groups discussed and identified economic issues arising from the September attacks.
While many of the issues were sector-specific there was a great deal of inter-relatedness among the groups' issues.
The issues outlined in this final report represent a consensus perspective of the economic impacts and issues coming from the work groups' deliberations.
While some of the recommended responses in this final report are directly linked to economic impacts of the September attacks, others are targeted to stimulating the economy in areas that appear to be most critically affected.
Implementation of these responses can be done through several mechanisms.
Some actions can be carried out through the existing work and financial resources of pertinent state agencies.
Other responses will be linked to federal financial disaster assistance that will be provided to the Commonwealth.
Still other responses may need support from other sources.
This report outlines the post-attack economic conditions of the Commonwealth.
It then describes the broad issues identified through the work groups' efforts.
The responses recommended in this report are also derived from the groups' work.
The members of the Task Force are included in Appendix C of the report.
For more complete information on the Task Force's work, please refer to the web site, varesponse.org to review work group reports and other related information.
Their contributions to this endeavor and to the economic well being of the Commonwealth are gratefully acknowledged.

IMPACT The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, resulted in the loss of life of many of our citizens and affected the lives of many others.
In addition to the immediate devastating impact of the terrorist attacks, there has been significant disruption of our economic systems.
An already weakening economy was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks.
Only consistently strong consumer spending was keeping real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth from falling negative, and with the attacks, consumer and business confidence was shattered.
Subsequent to the attacks, there is virtually unanimous consensus among economists that the U.S. economy will fall into a recession.
The U.S. economy experienced a severe shock on September 11.
Some of the short-term economic implications are clear.
Air transportation, insurance, and hospitality industries will suffer substantial losses.
Early signs indicate that consumers are cutting back spending following the September 11 attacks.
Retail sales and consumer confidence were down sharply in September.
Payroll employment dropped substantially in September, and October's report is expected to show a much bleaker employment picture.
Industrial output continued to decline in September, and production of consumer goods dropped in the third quarter.
The long-term implications are less clear.
The reaction of consumers and businesses will determine whether the economic downturn will be a prolonged one.
It is hoped that aggressive fis cal and monetary policy will lead to a sustainable recovery in the second half of 2002.
Virginia will suffer significant losses as a result of the attack on the Pentagon, the three-week closure of Reagan National Airport, and the extended deployment of troops from Hampton Roads.
In addition, the national economic downturn will impact Virginia's economy as well.
Financial, transportation, trade, and tourism activities in the Commonwealth have been affected.
As a direct result of the attacks, Virginia's economy has suffered a loss of over $1.2 billion; and approximately 5,000 Virginians have filed for unemployment compensation.
In addition to the workers who have been directly affected by the terrorist attacks, another 35,000 Virginians across the state have filed for unemployment benefits within the last month.
Air service and aviation-related businesses in Virginia have suffered tremendous losses.
The three-week closure of Reagan National Airport in Arlington County put approximately 12,000 airport jobs in jeopardy.
This includes 8,000 airline jobs, 600 con cession workers, and 1,800 local and ground transportation workers.
(See Table 1.)

Jobs at Reagan National Airport account for almost 8 percent of Arlington's employment.
The Services, Government, Trade, and Transportation industries are the four largest sectors in Arlington, accounting for over 90 percent of Arlington's jobs.
(See Table 2.)
Employment in the transportation industry accounts for almost 10 percent of Arlington's jobs.
Airline jobs at Reagan National Airport comprise over half of Arlington's transportation industry.
While the airport is approaching 50 percent of its original activi ty, only a fraction of workers are back to work.

In Hampton Roads, previous extended troop deployments result ed in substantial economic costs to the local economy of the area.
During the Gulf War when there was significant overseas deployment, taxable retail sales in the Hampton Roads area fell by six percent.
It has already been announced that naval troops based in Norfolk will not return to base as normally scheduled, which will result in economic losses for the Hampton Roads area.
Virginia experienced and continues to experience significant eco nomic losses stemming from the terrorist attacks on September 11.
An economic impact study was conducted to estimate Virginia's loss.
This complete analysis can be viewed on vare sponse.org.
The recommendations contained in this report are expected to have a positive impact on the economic disruptions the Commonwealth is now experiencing.
Table 3
The effect on Virginia's air service and aviation-related businesses extends beyond the Reagan National Airport impact.
Restrictions on general aviation in the Washington metropolitan area, the economic instability of the airline industry and subsequent reductions in airline employment and air service, and the new regulatory and safety mandates at our commercial air service airports are also contributing to the losses experienced by this industry.
In addition to jobs directly tied to the airport, thousands of touristrelated jobs in the hotel, motel, restaurant, and retail industries were affected.
The Northern Virginia region contributes 42 percent to the visitor-spending revenues generated to the state and 46 percent of the direct tourism-related jobs.
Northern Virginia hotels that normally enjoy 80 percent occupancy have been running below 30 percent.
Travel has slowed, which means fewer customers at restaurants and retail shops.
Metro-area restaurants are laying off workers and experiencing a downturn in revenues.
The agriculture industry experienced a sharp decrease in sales in almost all areas in the two weeks following the attacks.
While some segments of the agriculture industry are rebounding, others such as working watermen, those involved in eco-tourism, and nurserymen continue to face uncertainty.

IMMEDIATE RESPONSES Governor Gilmore and the Task Force have already begun implementing a number of actions addressing the identified economic impacts.
Some of these actions were needed to target urgent situations requiring a direct and immediate response.
Others were initiated to begin addressing the most immediately apparent economic impacts.
The steps already taken by the Governor and the Task Force are outlined below.
Â· Worked closely with President Bush and Secretary of Transportation Mineta to facilitate the re-opening of Reagan National Airport.
Full service will be phased in as additional security measures are instituted.
Opened a full-service Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) office that continues to operate at Reagan National Airport to assist businesses and employees impacted by its temporary closing.
Staff from the Small Business Administration and from local Workforce Investment Board One-Stop centers is available at the office in addition to VEC staff.
Streamlined the unemployment claims process by using an abbreviated short form and backdating unemployment claims to September 9, 2001.
Waived the one-week waiting period for all disaster-related unemployment claims.
Waived work search requirements for all disaster-related claimants.
Increased, on a temporary basis, the maximum weekly amount for unemployment insurance benefits from $268 per week to $368 per week.
Submitted a $5 million National Emergency Grant request to the U.S. Department of Labor to cover administrative costs incurred by the VEC.
Submitted a $10 million National Emergency Grant request to the U.S. Department of Labor to provide workforce services and job training to those affected by the Reagan closure.
Â· Â·
This grant request was developed in cooperation with the local workforce investment boards in Northern Virginia, where the majority of the dislocated workers were employed.
Increased funding to local workforce boards for dislocated workers by $500,000 ($300,000 to the Northern Virginia Workforce Investment Board and $200,000 to the Arlington/Alexandria Workforce Investment Board).
Requested $3.18 billion in post-attack federal assistance for aid needed for direct recovery, economic stimulus, and preparation for possible future attacks.
Initiated a $1.5 million advertising and matching grants program, "Virginia Stands for Freedom," to stimulate Virginia's tourism industry recovery over the short term.
Added $600,000 additional funding for the Virginia Capital Access Program to aid small businesses and entrepreneurs affected in the wake of the attacks.
This will leverage up to $18 million in additional financial assistance for small businesses affected by the terrorist attacks and their aftermath.
Include language in the Governor's budget to enable the Port of Virginia to issue more than $130 million in bonds to begin major renovations to the Norfolk International Terminals South wharf.
Released construction funds of $30 million for building projects at Old Dominion University and Virginia Tech to help stimulate the economy and enhance educational capacity.
Created the Governor's Emergency Opportunity Fund to attract new jobs to Virginia over the next 90 days.
Requested a $300,000 grant from the Economic Development Administration for additional Small Business Development staff for centers in Arlington County, Alexandria and Hampton Roads.

ISSUES AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS Each work group identified economic impacts resulting from the September 11 attacks.
While different work groups' perspectives on these impacts varied somewhat, the larger issues that they related to were very similar.
These broader issue areas and recommended actions associated with them are described in this section.
Issue 1: Unemployment Increases Sharply The terrorist attacks and resulting fear of travel, particularly to the Washington, D.C. area, have generated sharply increased unemployment with the temporary closure of Reagan National Airport, and throughout the tourism and hospitality industry (e.g., hotels and restaurants, airlines, travel agents, convention facilities, and school and business group travel).
Indirectly, providers of related goods and services (often small businesses such as taxi drivers, food and souvenir kiosk operators, and the like) have suffered from this costly business disruption.
This fear and disruption will only intensify with growing concerns over the threat of bioterrorism.
One of the most significant effects of the September 11 attacks has been sharply decreased revenues and resulting increased unemployment in the travel and tourism industries, and related service providers including primarily hotels and restaurants.
As recently as August 2001, broad economic measures such as employment, production and business spending remained weak.
After the damage to the Pentagon, the most significant and immediate impact of the terrorist attacks in Virginia arose from the closing of Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.
The ripple effect from this closure (which is still partially in effect) continues to be felt most strongly in that region of the Commonwealth, from sales and services closely connected with National Airport and air travel in general.
USAirways in Northern Virginia has experienced significant layoffs recently, because of decreased air travel caused by fears of further hijackings.
As a direct result of the attacks, Virginia's economy has suffered an estimated loss of over $1.2 billion and more than 5,000 Virginians have filed for unemployment.
In addition to the workers who have been directly affected by the September 11th
attacks, another 35,000 Virginians have filed for unemployment across the state, which is more than double the number during the same time period last year.
Governor Gilmore took swift and decisive action in the days immediately following the September 11 attacks to ensure that affected workers would receive economic assistance.
Modifications were made to the unemployment application process and benefits to help dislocated workers.
These immedi ate actions are detailed in the preceding section.
Recommended Actions Â· Open a full-service Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) office that continues to operate at Reagan National Airport to assist businesses and employees impacted by its temporary closing.
Staff from the Small Business Administration and from local Workforce Investment Board One-Stop centers is available at the office in addition to VEC staff.
(Already implemented) Streamline the unemployment claims process by using an abbreviated short form and backdating unemployment claims to September 9, 2001.
(Already implemented) Waive the one-week waiting period for all disaster-related unemployment claims.
(Already implemented) Waive work search requirements for all disaster-related claimants.
(Already implemented) Increase, on a temporary basis, the maximum weekly amount for unemployment insurance benefits from $268 per week to $368 per week.
(Already implemented) Submit a $5 million National Emergency Grant request to the U.S. Department of Labor to cover administrative costs incurred by the VEC.
(Already implemented) Work with federal officials to expedite resumption of full service at Reagan National Airport.
Jobs at Reagan National Airport account for almost 8 percent of Arlington County's employment.
While the airport has reopened, only a fraction of workers are back on the job.
Â·
Â·

H
Â·
Consider requesting the disaster declaration be extended beyond the normal eighteen-month period if deemed necessary.
Provide a six-month waiver on penalties for those employers who file their unemployment insurance tax payments late.
The waiver would only apply to those employers who are adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks and subsequent closure of Reagan Airport.
Provide state tax credits (similar to the Work Opportunity Tax credit) to employers who hire workers displaced as a result of the terrorist attacks.
Â·
This funding for retraining will enable existing Virginia companies to compete for corporate investments or expansions with neighboring states, all of which fund retraining programs.
Â· Support federal legislation for workforce needs including up to 13 weeks of additional unemployment benefits for workers and grants that could be used to cover up to 75 percent of displaced workers' COBRA health insurance payments for up to ten months.
Conduct job fairs in Northern Virginia and other areas of the state that may have been affected or impacted by the terrorist attacks.
Market the Virginia Workforce Network.
Employment-related services from four secretariats, 15 state agencies, and private partners are available at one-stop centers throughout the Commonwealth.
Prepare a new Virginia Workforce Strategy that will include advancements reported by entities involved and adjustments needed to assure continued advancements in economic development.
Undertake a forecast of job openings and job growth by occupation to reflect the recent economic impacts.
Job training could be targeted to jobs that will be in high demand.
Provide incentives to Virginia shipyards that train skilled workers.
Encourage the federal government and the private sector to institute staggered work schedules in Northern Virginia to help reduce traffic congestion.
State government facilities should also be encouraged to follow suit.
Increase the capacity of the Virginia Railway Express.
Increase the capacity of Virginia Department of Transportation park and ride lots.
Expand and enhance feeder bus service to additional Metro Rail stations.
Provide enhanced and expanded bus services through the Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission to help relieve congestion and provide additional emergency transportation options.
Extend Metro Rail service to Tyson's Corner/Dulles Airport.
Expand parking facilities for Metro Rail stations.
Extend HOV lanes in Prince William County.
Â·
Â·
Issue 2: Changing Workforce Needs The need for workforce training and retraining for jobs in emerging and stable industries increases with the downturn in travel, tourism and hospitality.
In addition, Virginia should take advantage statewide of increased demand in defense, security, high tech, and government contracting and biomedical industries.
Increased teleworking opportunities and staggered work hours in Northern Virginia and throughout the Commonwealth can help make jobs more accessible to a broader range of the workforce.
This will also alleviate stress on highways and public transit, will facilitate emergency evacuation, and will improve general quality of life in Northern Virginia particularly due to reduced hours in the car.
Recommended Actions Â· Submit a $10 million National Emergency Grant request to the U.S. Department of Labor to provide workforce services and job training to those affected by the Reagan closure.
This grant request was developed in cooperation with the local workforce investment boards in Northern Virginia, where the majority of the dislocated workers were employed.
(Already implemented) Increase funding to local workforce boards for dislocated workers by $500,000 ($300,000 to the Northern Virginia Workforce Investment Board and $200,000 to the Arlington/Alexandria Workforce Investment Board).
(Already implemented) Fund retraining program to prepare Virginia workers for new demands and new jobs in healthy, stable industries.
The terrorist attacks have displaced a significant number of workers who could benefit from retraining for some of the technology jobs for which supply does not meet demand.

Issue 3: Decline in Tourism The tourism industry was experiencing a decrease in business in general due to the softening of the economy prior to the September 11 attacks.
Because of cancellations subsequent to the attacks, continued concerns related to travel and an overall decline in consumer spending, Virginia's tourism industry is now facing significant shortfalls in anticipated visitation and visitor spending.
The economic shockwave to tourism in Northern Virginia has rippled throughout the state, affecting regions to varying degrees.
The closure of Reagan National Airport and the limitations on its current use have had a devastating impact on Northern Virginia.
The Northern Virginia region contributes 42% ($5.26 billion) of the visitor spending revenues generated to the state.
This area also accounts for 46% of direct tourism-related jobs and 55% of the tourism industry's payroll in the state.
Twenty percent of the travel agencies in Virginia are expected to close in the coming year and those that remain in business will decrease their staff by 20 to 25 percent.
Decreased tourist and consumer spending will result in decreased state and local revenues from sales tax, meals and lodging tax and other revenue sources.
Recommended Actions Â· Expedite resumption of full service at Reagan National Airport.
Initiate a $1.5 million advertising and matching grants program, "Virginia Stands for Freedom," to stimulate Virginia's tourism industry recovery over the short term.
(Already implemented) Initiate a longer-term, 24 months multi-dimensional marketing campaign that targets niches of the tourism market that have been identified as declining or potentially declining.
Provide small travel related businesses with low interest or bridge loans to get them through the crisis.
Encourage leniency to travel related businesses on bank loan payments.
Coordinate public and private sector tourism advertising efforts to maximize visitation.
Create more leisure packages based on themes, pricing and geography.
7
Â·
Encourage and participate in collaboration and joint efforts on consumer advertising, sales, public relations and destination marketing among industry partners.
Partner with the Northern Virginia Visitors Consortium on a near-term advertising and marketing campaign to regain tourism.
This advertising campaign would dovetail with Washington D. C.'s multi-million dollar marketing and advertising recovery program.
Â·
Issue 4: Impacts on small business and decline in international trade in Virginia goods, services and agricultural products Consumer spending comprises two-thirds of national production, so health in this sector generally drives the economy.
Consumer confidence, seriously shaken by the armed conflict and the threat of further attacks on American soil of any nature, has resulted in decreased personal and business spending in the weeks immedi ately following September 11.
As the initial effect has dimin ished, economic activity has recovered some, although the effect across various sectors of the economy has been uneven.
Reduction in flight schedules, continued concerns about air trav el and higher levels of security in all forms of travel and shipping have impacted international trade.
Shipping delays and reduced marketing and buying trips have also reduced sales for many sectors.
Federal spending has been directed toward a variety of defense-related needs, which may have a positive impact on Virginia but may also result in reduced funding for other sectors, such as agricultural support.
Small businesses have suffered from these impacts.
The decline in tourism has affected small businesses that are directly tied to the hospitality industry, but others have also suffered from the overall reductions in consumer spending as well.
Many small businesses operate with little or no margin to absorb decreased earnings.
This presents a significant difficulty for sole propri etors, typically not covered by unemployment compensation, whose earnings have suffered or vanished.
Further, if these businesses fail, additional unemployment will result.
In Hampton Roads, the deployment of a large number of military personnel will have a significant, if temporary, negative impact on the local economy from reduced sales and shaken consumer confidence.
For the three quarter-period beginning in October 2001, it is estimated that the Hampton Roads region will experi ence a loss of $1.125 billion in economic activity.
Â·
Â·
Â·
Â·
Â·
Â·
H
The agricultural sector experienced sharp decreases in sales in the two weeks immediately following the attacks in almost all areas.
While sales in some areas are showing signs of recovery, the drop in consumer confidence continues to have an effect.
New security measures, including those relating to crop-dusters, will have an on-going impact on the agricultural business.
An additional issue is the increasing public concern about the safety of the American food supply.
Recommended Actions Â· Add $600,000 additional funding for the Virginia Capital Access Program to aid small businesses and entrepreneurs affected in the wake of the attacks.
This will leverage up to $18 million in additional financial assistance for small businesses affected by the terrorist attacks and their aftermath.
(Already implemented) Create the Governor's Emergency Opportunity Fund to attract new jobs to Virginia over the next 90 days.
(Already implemented) Seek federal funding from the Economic Development Administration to augment SBDC staffs in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads.
(Already submitted) Support approval of the proposed Trade Promotion Authority for the President.
Encourage support of a farm bill that ensures the survival of Virginia agricultural businesses.
Aggressively promote Virginia agricultural products throughout Virginia and the East Coast.
Intensify current international marketing efforts through greater use of virtual trade shows, exploration of Central and Latin American markets, and have a trade mission for agriculture.
Establish a program to promote and subsidize the usage of Virginia products in state institutions, agencies and schools.
Review the state law on eco-terrorism to determine whether the penalty for damaging agriculture research facilities is severe enough.
Launch a well-designed press or media campaign with appropriate partners to inform the public that mechanisms are in place to ensure the safety of the food supply.
Assist businesses that have extensive monetary losses in finding low cost loans to keep them operating until the economic situation improves.
8
Â·
Provide tax relief to farmers who are affected by the reduction in funding for federal programs.
Ask the Small Business Administration to extend benefits to counties that are noncontiguous to the declared disaster locations.
Expand the Virginia Capital Access Program to continue assistance to small businesses impacted by the downturn in the economy that have been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks.
Both state and federal funding sources should be sought for increased assistance to support VCAP's anticipated growth in demand.
Petition the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration (EDA) for authorization to use Department of Business Assistance's Revolving Loan Fund (partially funded by EDA) in Northern Virginia localities that are contiguous to the localities that have been declared to be "disaster areas".

Issue 5: Decreased air service Decreased jet service in general and withdrawal from smaller markets in particular will seriously affect the Virginia economy.
Domestic and foreign carriers serving Virginia have cancelled a significant portion of their flights, with US carriers averaging 20% fewer flights than before September 11.
In addition, these carriers have implemented huge lay-offs, most notably American and United with 20,000 each.
US Airways, headquartered in Arlington, has laid off 11,000 employees nationwide.
United Airlines employs nearly 7,000 in Northern Virginia, and is in fact the largest employer in Loudoun County.
Merrill Lynch esti mates that US airlines could lose $6.5 billion in 2001 and $3.5 billion in 2002.
United Express has announced the elimination of all flights out of Lynchburg and Shenandoah Valley airports, and cancelled all non-stop flights from Newport News to Dulles.
US Airways will end full-size jet service to Roanoke, which is losing 25% of total seats out of that market.
In addition to the negative economic impact, these withdrawals will negatively affect economic devel opment recruiting.
As a general principle, economic develop ment recruiters find jet service to a locality a valuable recruiting tool.
The cancellation of jet services to such smaller cities as Roanoke or Lynchburg will make it more difficult to market those locations to companies preferring jet service for travel between a Virginia location and, for example, corporate headquarters.
With reduced usage of Reagan National Airport traffic to Dulles is heavier than usual.

Tyson's Corner and Dulles would alleviate the stress on the transportation system.
The initial restrictions on general aviation traffic significantly affected airports and aviation businesses inside the 25-mile no fly zone around Washington, D.C.
For almost a month after the September 11th attacks, the no fly zone prohibited the use of private, or Part 91, aircraft operations.
On October 6th, prohibitions were lifted at Dulles but remain in effect at Reagan National Airport.
Recommended Actions Â· Continue advocating for full service capacity at Reagan National Airport while preserving appropriate security measures.
Reopen Reagan National to Part 91, general aviation operations, under safety and security measures discussed and negotiated between the federal government and the general aviation industry.
Produce public service announcements highlighting the new safety and security measures in aviation to encourage Virginians to fly.
Support federal legislative initiatives such as the General Aviation Small Business Relief Act of 2001 that would provide the necessary financial assistance to keep small aviation businesses operating.
Implement personnel enhancements at the air traffic control facilities at Dulles International to help increase capacity.
Assess the needs of air carrier airports to comply with new federal security regulations.
Continue efforts to attract and retain quality air service.
Consider providing economic incentives for airlines and other air carriers.
Consider the deferral of certain state taxes for struggling air carriers.
and responses will need to be refined as information on the changing economic environment is developed and analyzed.
Steps will also need to be taken to assure that individuals and businesses directly affected by the attacks receive the economic relief that is called for.
Actions are also needed to ensure that the strong charitable response from across America is managed and channeled effectively and through legal mechanisms.
The state should capitalize on the opportunity to create partnerships using private corporate and individual funds, in addition to federal funds that may become available.
In addition, Virginia should capitalize on increased demands in the information secu rity and protective services industries through high technology and information technology companies, both through the private sector and government contracting.
In order to provide economic momentum in severely affected areas planned construction projects such as transportation and education can be accelerated.
These accelerated projects will alleviate the short-term unemployment problem, inject needed spending into the economy as well as address the long-term goals of the Commonwealth.
Recommended Actions Â· Obtain and provide up-to-date information on business impacts through a dedicated web site.
Explore the use of Economic Development Administration funds to establish a program to monitor, update and coordinate the local and regional economies of Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads with the state.
Assist in identifying individuals and businesses with disaster-related needs and help direct them to appropriate sources of assistance, including charitable organizations.
Ensure that charitable organizations are appropriately registered, monitored and publicized so that donations are suitably channeled and victims can readily access them.
Coordinate with and publicize the efforts of the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association to provide legal assistance to help victims of the terrorist attacks.
Request $3.18 billion in post-attack federal assistance for aid needed for direct recovery, economic stimulus, and preparation for possible future attacks.

CONCLUSION Repercussions of the September 11th attacks continue to affect the Commonwealth and the nation.
While we can never erase the trauma and loss caused by these attacks, the action strategies put forward by this Task Force are a wide-ranging response to their economic impacts.
The multi-dimensional recommendations made in this report can make a real and vital difference in how we face the future.
While many decisive actions have already been initiated, there is more to be accomplished.
The Commonwealth should move forward using its legislative, budgetary and execu tive agency resources to help address the economic issues that remain before us.
Working together, we can ensure the economic prosperity of all Virginians.
