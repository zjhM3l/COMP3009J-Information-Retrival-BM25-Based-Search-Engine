Coastal Zone Boundary Definitions Â­ Statewide Federal Lands May 2, 2001 Â­ For Task I Metadata Boundary Definition Excluded from Alaska's coastal zone boundaries are "those lands owned, leased, held in trust or whose use is otherwise by law subject solely to the discretion of the Federal Government, its officers or agents..." (15CFR 923.33).
All uses and activities on excluded federal lands that directly affect the coastal area must be consistent to the maximum extent practical with the ACMP and are subject to the consistency provisions of Section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended.
The statewide seaward coastal zone boundary is the "outer limit of the United States territorial sea" (15 CFR 923.32), which is the "three geographic mile line" (43 CFR 3301.1).
The statewide seaward boundary depicted was extracted from the Outer Continental Shelf Official Protraction Diagram map series (Bureau of Land Management, October 1977).
The inland coastal zone boundary includes entire (minor) islands and the lands and waters within (1) the timberline of the coastal Sitka spruce/hemlock forest, (2) slopes contiguous with marine waters where mass wasting is evident or likely to occur, and (3) unvegetated areas left by receding glaciers where the coastal forest is likely to invade.
Onsite visits or reference to 1:63,360 or larger topographic maps or other source data may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether a use or activity will lie within the coastal zone.

The inland coastal boundary of the Municipality of Anchorage along the coast between the MatanuskaSusitna Borough and Potter Creek includes all lands and waters within: (1) a zone extending 1,320 feet inland, measured horizontally, from the extent of the 100-year coastal flood; (2) the 100-year floodplain or 200 feet from the center (whichever is greater) of each river and stream intersected by the 1,320-foot zone up to the 1,000-foot elevation contour; and (3) other areas as delineated on this map (map #94, Coastal Zone Boundaries of Alaska, ACMP, June 1988).
The inland boundary in watersheds of the upper Knik River and south of Potter Creek includes all lands and waters within the 1,000-foot elevation contour.
Reference to 1:25,000 or 1:63,360 USGS topographic maps, Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate maps, or the Anchorage Coastal Management Program may be necessary to determine if the above criteria apply and whether the use or activity lie within the coastal zone (Coastal Zone Boundaries of Alaska, Alaska Coastal Zone Management Program, 1988).

The Bering Straits CRSA inland coastal zone boundary encompasses a combination of selected watersheds, drainage basins, and uniform one-mile corridors from ordinary high water along each side of fish streams and rivers that provide habitat for important populations of anadromous fish (Map 3-1).
In addition, all offshore islands within the Bering Straits CRSA (including St. Lawrence Island) are included in their entirety.
To protect anadromous fish resources and habitats in the areas with greatest potential for mineral development, the Bering Straits CRSA coastal area boundary includes watersheds and drainages where mineral potential is rated as high or very high by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR).
For lands within the CRSA south of Cape Denbigh where mineral potential has not been recently evaluated by the ADNR, the potential for mineral development has been associated with highly mineralized terranes, as identified by the Arctic Environmental Information and Data Center in a map series published in 1982 (Volume 2, Map 7-1).
Areas inland from the interim coastal boundary with identified mineral resources of lesser potential have not been included in the coastal area boundary due to the reduced likelihood of development in the foreseeable future.
Inland from the interim coastal boundary, rivers and streams which support anadromous fish in areas where the likelihood of mineral or other development is low are included in the coastal area boundary through provision of a corridor extending one mile from the ordinary high water mark on both sides of the stream, or from the outermost active channel within braided or split-channel
Bering Straits CRSA

floodplains.
This corridor extends upstream to one mile above the limits of known distribution of anadromous fish.
The Bering Straits CRSA coastal boundary also provides for an inland setback of two miles from the marine coastal shoreline where bluffs are adjacent to or in close proximity to the coast.
Application of the 200-foot elevation biophysical criteria for the interim coastal boundary is inappropriate where bluffs higher than 200 feet adjoin or are in relatively close proximity to marine waters; in some instances, the interim coastal boundary does not even encompass the coastal bluff.
In these situations, an inland boundary has been prescribed to encompass areas clearly within a zone of marine coastal influence and in which uses and activities could have direct and significant impacts on coastal habitats and coastally-dependent resources.
Map 3-1 shows that the coastal area boundary south of the Inglutalik River to the southern limits of the CRSA is comprised of the interim coastal boundary, one mile corridors along anadromous fish streams, and limited extent mineralized areas within portions of the drainage basin of the Unalakleet, Shaktoolik, Ungalik, and Inglutalik Rivers.
From the Koyuk River west to the Sinuk River, extensive and contiguous zones of high mineral potential encompass the watersheds of the Koyuk, Tubutulik, Fish, Niukluk, and Sinuk Rivers within stream reaches utilized by anadromous fish.
The portions of these watersheds which emanate from high potential mineralized areas inland from the inland boundary are included within the coastal boundary.
Coastallyassociated bluffs within two miles of the marine coastline are included in the coastal boundary near Bald Head, and between Moses Point and Cape Darby.
The City of Nome has developed its own coastal management program, and the area encompassed by the Nome district is not included within the Bering Straits CRSA coastal boundary.
Anadromous fish habitats in rivers draining to Imuruk Basin and Port Clarence include non-mineralized areas south of the Basin, and extensive mineralized zones in the Kuzitrin, Noxapaga, Agaigpuk, and American Rivers.
Watersheds and portions of drainage basins which originate in these high potential mineral areas are included in the coastal area boundary.
Where mineralized areas are not present within the watersheds of anadromous fish streams, one mile corridors along the watercourse are delineated.
Coastally-associated bluffs within two miles of the marine coastline of Port Clarence south and east of Teller are included within the coastal boundary.
West of Port Clarence to Cape Prince of Wales, and north along the coast to Shishmaref Inlet, anadromous fish habitats and high potential mineral areas are more widely distributed and interspersed, creating a coastal boundary comprised of smaller watersheds, portions of anadromous fish stream drainage basins, and one mile corridors along anadromous streams where high mineral potential has not been identified.
The coastal topography northeast from Cape Prince of Wales changes to a broad coastal plain which extends inland up to 15 miles before foothills are encountered.
West of Brevig Lagoon near
3
Lost River, coastally-associated bluffs within two miles of the marine coastline are included in the coastal area boundary.
From Shishmaref Inlet north to the common boundary with the NANA CRSA, the broad coastal plain is principally encompassed by the interim coastal boundary and shorter drainage systems which have not been documented to support anadromous fish.
This area does not contain identified mineralized areas adjacent to the coast, but mineralized areas are present in the upper portions of stream watersheds.
In the coastal boundary regions described above, the transition between watershed or drainage basin criteria and one mile corridor criteria follows the most reasonable and appropriate features available (drainage divides, topography, political boundaries) to appropriately represent resource concerns and to provide an identifiable coastal boundary.
Some areas surrounded by the coastal area, have not currently been documented to provide anadromous fish habitats, and at present are considered low potential for mineral development or other uses and activities with the likelihood of direct and significant impacts to coastal resources.
Some areas outside the Bering Straits CRSA coastal boundary could be affected by development activities, but there is less certainty that activities occurring in these areas could result in direct and significant impacts to coastal resources.
These areas are classified as "Permit Notification Areas" (PNA), and are shown on Map 3-1.
The areas include wetlands south of St. Michael, portions of the uplands along the southern part of the Serpentine River watershed, and portions of the Fish River and Tubutulik River watersheds.
Authorizing and permitting agencies must notify the Bering Straits CRSA of permit applications which are received for activities in the PNA.
The CRSA and the agencies then evaluate each project on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the project is likely to have direct and significant impacts on coastal resources within the coastal boundary.
If a project is likely to have such impacts, the project will be subject to the same consistency review procedures applied to uses and activities which occur within the coastal area boundary (see Chapter 6, Implementation).

The Cordova inland coastal zone boundary may change with a significant amendment to its coastal management program in 2001.
The 1986 Cordova Coastal Management Program defines the limits of the inland coastal zone as extending from the western edge of the right-of-way of the State highway (a combination of New England Cannery Road, Railroad Avenue, Copper River Highway, and Three Mile Road) seaward to the Cordova city limits.
The Cordova Coastal Zone also includes that portion of Eyak Lake Area which Merits Special Attention which lies within the city limits as of 1986, and the area between Chase Avenue and the Copper River Highway.
Notably, there are two exceptions where the zone extends uphill of the State highway.
These are Ski Hill and the Fleming Creek, including the lagoon at the mouth of Fleming Creek.
Along the lagoon and creek, the zone includes all land that is encompassed by a setback of 50 feet from the center of the stream, or the line at mean high tide along the lagoon.
