..............................................27 1999 Annual Report ANNUAL MESSAGE FROM DOUGLAS K. MARTIN ARIZONA STATE MINE INSPECTOR Our Agency Mission is to administer and enforce the Mining Code of the State of Arizona for the protection of life, health and safety of the mine employees and the public in Arizonas active, inactive, and abandoned mines.
The State Mine Inspector is a state-wide elected constitutional officer and the director of the Office of the State Mine Inspector.
The Office was established by the Constitution of the State of Arizona, Article XIX.
This agency enforces statutes, rules, and regulations applicable to mine safety, health, abandoned mines, and land reclamation under ARS Title 27 Minerals, Oil and Gas and Arizona Administrative Code Title 11 - Mining.
The agency inspects the health and safety conditions and practices at active mining operations; investigates mine accidents, employee and public complaints; and conducts federally certified miner and instructor safety training.
The agency administers $100 million in reclamation assurance bonds and enforces the Mined Land Reclamation laws, rules and regulations for the restoration of disturbed lands to a safe and stable environmental condition.
The agency promotes public safety regarding abandoned mines by Stay Out Stay Alive promotions, presentations and publications; complaint investigations; mine owner compliance notifications (ARS 27-318); identification, hazard assessment, prioritization, posting and securing of safety hazards.
Four interagency programs exist to accomplish our mission.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Mine Safety Enforcement Program performs frequent health and safety inspections at active mines and related facilities; conducts investigations of mine accidents, employee and citizen complaints; and provides certification classes in mine rescue and first aid.
The program issues violations, cessation orders, mine elevator operating permits and underground diesel equipment operating permits as tools to promote safe and healthful work conditions.
Operations under this programs jurisdiction include asphalt hot plants, concrete batch plants, aggregate pits, quarries and processing plants; underground and open pit mines, mills, SX-EW Plants, smelters, refineries, and rod plants.
Jurisdiction also covers contractor employees working at mine sites.
Additionally, Deputy Mine Inspectors perform complaint investigations and land owner compliance inspections (ARS 27-318) at abandoned mines to support the Abandoned Mines Inventory 
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Abandoned Mines Inventory and Remediation Programs efforts fall into two categories; the inventory of abandoned mine sites and the administration of the securing, remediation, and closure of abandoned mines.
Field surveys locate mines within the 72,931,840 acres that comprise the State of Arizona.
This survey records the exact location of abandoned mines using a global positioning satellite system.
The inventorys objective is to produce an accurate count of abandoned mines, and describe the significant safety hazards and potential environmental hazards occurring with them.
The database of surveyed abandoned mines is used to provide for the prioritization of significant public and environmental hazards for remediation and reclamation planning.
The inventory also allows the agency to accurately investigate public concerns and complaints, about abandoned mines in a timely manner.
An abandoned mine may be used for criminal activities, such as a cache for stolen explosives or a body disposal site.
The program assists law enforcement investigations and body recoveries.
The administration of securing abandoned 1999 Annual Report mines first prioritizes sites listed in the inventory based on the severity of the threat posed to public and environmental safety.
Through this prioritization, structures are designed as necessary for abandoned mine closures on state lands.
The cost of field construction work to secure these mines is provided by the Abandoned Mine Safety Fund through mining industry donations, private citizen donations, and a matching appropriation from the legislature.
Regular monitoring is conducted to assure mine closures remain in good condition.
The program coordinates identifying and securing abandoned mines with local, state, and federal agencies as well as other states and volunteer groups.
Groups include the Yuma County Sheriffs Search and Rescue Group, the Maricopa County Sheriffs Office Mountain Search and Rescue Group, Arizona Department of Mines and Mineral Resources, Maricopa County Parks, Arizona State Land Department, Arizona Game and Fish, Arizona State Historic Preservation Office, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration, Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Western Governors Association, and the National Association of Abandoned Mined Land Programs, which is comprised of 27 states and three Indian Tribes.
The Education and Training Program certifies MSHA instructors, develops lesson plans, conducts classes, and organizes safety conferences for mine safety education and training.
The emphasis is placed on miners rights and current health and safety regulations in compliance with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, Title 30 CFR, Part 46, 48, 49, 56, and 57.
In addition to mining company employees, contractors, vendors and others regularly exposed to mine hazards at a mine property are required to have various levels of training furnished by the Education and Training division.
Even employees of the Department of Environmental Quality, Risk Management, and emergency response teams who have occasion to visit a mine property may need this training.
The Mined Land Reclamation Program, working in cooperation with mining companies, consultants, and other state and federal governmental agencies, approves or rejects mine reclamation plans and financial assurance mechanisms submitted by all metalliferous mining units and exploration operations with surface disturbances greater than five acres.
Annual reviews and on-site inspections of the regulated mines are a part of the continual monitoring process to establish compliance to the Mined Land Reclamation laws, rules and regulations.
Our team of experienced mine safety professionals continually strive to improve Agency programs and services so Arizona will be not only a leader in mining production, but in SAFE PRODUCTION as well.
4 1999 Annual Report INSPECTION The mission of the inspection program is to enforce the Mining Code of the State of Arizona for the protection of life, health and safety of the employees in Arizonas active mining operations.
The inspection program performs frequent health and safety inspections at active mines and related facilities; conducts investigations of mine accidents, employee and citizen complaints; and provides certification classes in mine rescue and first aid.
The program issues violations, cessation orders, mine elevator operating permits and underground diesel equipment operating permits as tools to promote safe and healthful work conditions.
Operations under this programs jurisdiction include asphalt hot plants, concrete batch plants, aggregate pits, quarries and processing plants; underground and open pit mines, mills, SX-EW Plants, smelters, refineries, and rod plants.
Jurisdiction also covers contractor employees working at mine sites.
Deputy Mine Inspectors also perform abandoned mine complaint investigations and land owner compliance inspections (ARS 27-318) to support the Abandoned Mines Inventory 
During calendar year 1999, the inspection team performed 416 health and safety inspections which identified 642 violations of the mining code for corrective actions by the mine operators.
Thirty-five elevator inspections were conducted and annual operating permits issued.
Nineteen underground diesel equipment operating permits were issued.
Three serious mine accidents, two fatal and one permanent disability, nine citizen complaints regarding dust and noise from mining operations, and two employee complaints concerning unsafe conditions were investigated.
No. of Inspections Surface Metal Mines, Mills, SX-EW Plants, Smelters Rock Products, Sand 
These figures represent 617 operating units with 14,323 workers.

The victim was employed by Road Machinery Company.
Mr. Lopez drove up to the haul truck from the right blind side and stopped directly in front of the haul truck in a blind spot.
The action of the victim was a failure to follow safe driving procedures while in an open pit environment.
Fatal of Mr. Frank Mejia Mr. Frank Mejia, an employee of Huachuca Concrete, Incorporated, was fatally injured on July 27, 1999 while he was attempting to dislodge a hang-up in a feed hopper and was engulfed by material.
The feeder belt was running and no safeguards were in place to pevent dumping material into the hopper while he was inside.
Three violations of the Arizona Mine Code were issued to the operator, with three additional safety recommendations.
Fatal of Mr. David Antone Mr. David Antone was fatally injured on August 9, 1999, when he was caught in a conveyor belt return roller.
The roller was not guarded and it was being cleaned with a hoe while the belt was running.
The victim was an employee of United Metro Materials Plant 48 sand and gravel mine, located in Sacaton, Arizona.
A complete investigation was not undertaken by the Arizona State Mine Inspector s Office, as the mine property is located on the Gila River Indian Community, which is not within the jurisdiction of this office.
24 1999 Annual Report EDUCATION AND TRAINING The Education and Training Department, through a MSHA grant, provides mine health and safety training for miners throughout the state.
This past year, Education and Training has focused on training miners who work at smaller mining operations which do not have the benefit of a full-time safety-training professional.
The Education and Training department also trains contractors who are exposed to the same hazards as miners on mine properties.
Our instructors teach subjects that meet the federal training requirements but tailor the materials to meet the needs and hazard exposure of the students.
The Arizona State Mine Inspector s goal is not only to teach and meet training requirements, but also to eliminate accidents at home or the workplace.
One of the skills learned in New Miner and Annual Refresher Training is First Aid, a lifesaving skill that is used at and away from the workplace.
In addition to providing training, the Education and Training Department maintains a video library and lends training tapes to the mining community for use in their safety training programs.
Education and Training also coordinates activities and assembles the program and speakers for the annual May instructor refresher course and the October International Mine Health and Safety Conference.
Number Number Number Number Number Number of Miners and Mine Contractors Trained of Instructors Trained and Certified as MSHA Instructors that Attended the Instructor Refresher Seminar that Attended the International Mine Health and Safety Conference Trained in First Aid Trained in Mine Rescue 3,065 31 80 181 324 20 3,701 Total Trained in 1999 25 1999 Annual Report ABANDONED AND INACTIVE MINES Through the first half of 1999, the Arizona State Mine Inspector s Office (ASMI), in conjunction with the State Land Department and the Department of Mines and Mineral Resources, developed criteria and procedures for choosing the best candidates to inaugurate closures under the Abandoned Mine Safety Fund.
The Funds inaugural site is adjacent to the Cave Creek Recreational Area near the towns of Carefree and Cave Creek.
The mine site consisted of four shafts, a partially collapsed adit, and a quarry highwall.
Numerous shallow prospects were also in the area.
The site was chosen for its proximity to new housing developments.
In working through the pre-closure clearances, it was found the site had been considered for exchange a few years prior and all the historical and archaeological clearances had been completed at that time.
This reduced the time frame of clearance process from several months to a few weeks.
Two of the four shafts had garbage and scrap metal inside.
The debris was removed and hauled off before the shafts and the adit were backfilled.
The quarry highwall was re-contoured to reduce the steep slope of the hill.
The second site chosen for the Abandoned Mine Safety Fund is the Tonopah-Belmont Mine, located southwest of Wickenburg.
The mine receives extensive visitation and is also home to a very large bat population.
The closure project consists of fencing several shafts, placing a grate over one shaft, and installing bat gates at several adits.
In April 1999, a pre-closure report on this mine was forwarded to the State Land Department and the State Historic Preservation Office.
Clearances for closure to proceed were not obtained until October 1999.
In June 1999, new information regarding the bat population came to light, causing a re-evaluation of the planned closure.
The closure activities are expected to be completed by mid-2000.
In May 1999, the Arizona State Mine Inspector s Office assisted a fifth grade class from Hawthorne Elementary School in learning about mining history in Arizona and the dangers associated with abandoned mines.
These students from Mesa wrote essays and painted pictures depicting hazards found in and around abandoned mine areas, and their work was displayed in the hallways of the Arizona Legislature.
The students assisted in erecting temporary barricades and posting warning signs at the Tonopah-Belmont Mine.
Fieldwork in 1999 covered a wide variety of areas from Parker, along the Colorado River, to Bagdad, and a long stretch along the San Pedro River.
Survey work completed around Parker was used to prioritize openings for closure by the Lake Havasu Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management.
One of the most dangerous openings secured was a large, deep shaft on the shoulder of a popular, heavily traveled gravel road.
In 1991, a group of retired executives approached the Arizona State Mine Inspector with a proposition to post warning signs at abandoned mines in southern Arizona.
Once a week, the group of nine take their own four wheel drive trucks out to visit, assess, and post mines.
Since 1991, they have posted over 6,000 openings in an area of roughly 7,000 square miles.
In 1999, they conducted 42 weekly trips and posted 257 warning signs on hazardous mines without suffering any injuries.
One member of the group suffered a heart attack during a field expedition and had to be airlifted to the nearest hospital.
He has since recovered completely.
At the end of the year, they lost one of their founding members who passed away after a long illness.
In 2000, the group plans to revisit areas that were worked early on, replacing signs that have weathered or been vandalized.
The biggest accomplishment of 1999 was the Arizona State Mine Inspector s Office receipt of a Risk Management Grant from the Arizona Department of Administration, Risk Management Office.
The grant was designated for the creation of an Abandoned Mines Safety Program, written on CD-ROM, to be used on classroom computers.
The Safety Program is designed for use by school children and teachers to educate them about the dangers in and around abandoned mines.
26 1999 Annual Report MINED LAND RECLAMATION Arizonas Mined Land Reclamation Act and Rules requires all metalliferous mines with five or more acres of disturbance on private lands to submit reclamation plans and financial assurance mechanisms to the State Mine Inspector for review and approval.
In 1999, two reclamation plans were submitted and one was approved.
Three plans are currently under review and two mines were granted extensions of time for plan submittal.
Sixteen annual status reports were received and reviewed; ten mines were inspected for compliance with the Act.
A total of 188 acres of mined land under the jurisdiction of the Mined Land Reclamation Act and Rules were reclaimed in 1999.
The Reclamation Division staff selected the recipient and presented the American Society for Surface Mining and Reclamations Pioneer of Reclamation Award at the Societys Annual Meeting, held Scottsdale, Arizona.
The staff also participated in a two-day tour of Arizona mines with Chilean government officials from the Comision Nacional del Medio Ambiente, hosted by the Bureau of Land Management.
