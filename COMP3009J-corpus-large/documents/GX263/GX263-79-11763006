The first section contains a cross-reference table showing the relationship of federal Hydrologic Unit watersheds to the Maryland's watershed segments and Tributary Strategy basins established for controlling nutrients to Chesapeake Bay.
For the most part, the State's watershed system fits within the federal system.
There are some minor discrepancies, however, over relatively small watershed areas.
These are noted in the table.
The second section contains metadata ("data about data") for each of the indicators used in determining Category I (restoration) watersheds and Category III (protection) watersheds.

Data Used in the Clean Water Action Plan Unified Watershed Assessment Name of Data Layer: Instream Physical Habitat (non-tidal) Definition: Multi-parameter indicator of instream physical habitat quality in first- through third-order non-tidal streams developed by the MBSS.
Data Source: MBSS Data Type: Condition _X_ Stressor _X_ Vulnerability ___ Trend ___ Growth ___ Other___ Method of Calculation: The Instream Physical Habitat Indicator score is based on seven measures of instream habitat quality that are scored for each site based on observations of habitat condition in streams during sample visits.
The seven habitat measures rate the quantity and quality of physical habitat available in the stream for fish and benthic macroinvertebrate colonization and rate the degree to which the stream channel has been altered due to perturbations in the watershed landscape.
A mean for these seven measures was calculated for each sampled site, and the mean habitat score for each 8 digit watershed expressed on a 1 to 10 scale is reported.

Memorandum dated 8 July 1998 From Bob Lunsford to Paul Massicot Data Used in the Clean Water Action Plan Unified Watershed Assessment Name of Data Layer: Tidal Water Quality "Habitat Status Index" Definition (General Description): This index is the mean of current status (1994-1996) information, scored according to a 10-level scale, for surface chlorophyll a, secchi depth and summer (July - September) bottom dissolved oxygen.
Values are consolidated into a single mean for each major tidal tributary.
For more information, please see "Methods used for Tidal Water Quality, SAV, Benthic IBI and Fish IBI data consolidation for the INRA/UWA project".
Data Source: Maryland Department of Natural Resources Tidal Water and Habitat Quality Monitoring Program Data Type: Condition _X_ Stressor ___ Vulnerability ___ Trend ___ Growth ___ Other ___ Method of Calculation: Current status (1994-1996) was determined for each of the three index components according to methods used for Tributary Strategies assessments (see "Methods used for Tidal Water Quality, SAV, Benthic IBI and Fish IBI data consolidation for the INRA/UWA project" for more information).
Individual components status scores were converted to a score of 1 (most degraded) to 10 (best condition) and then combined into an overall index mean by station.
For 8-digit watersheds that included more than one station, these overall index means by station were then averaged to determine the watershed mean (which is the same as the overall index mean when only one station is in an 8-digit watershed).
Finally, these 8-digit watershed means were averaged within larger drainage basins (for the Potomac, Patuxent, Choptank, Nanticoke, and Elk Rivers).
From this last step, multiple 8-digit watersheds are given the same overall index INRA/UWA score to reflect the interactions of watersheds upstream and downstream of each other within a tributary basin.
For the UWA, watersheds are placed in Category I (needs restoration) if they are in the lower 25% of scores for the 138 watersheds for the Habitat Status Index.
Watersheds are placed in Category II (needs preventative action) if they have scores in the higher 75% of scores for the 138 watersheds.
Because no system is considered to be pristine, none of the watersheds are placed in Category III (pristine watersheds).
Watershed Scale: Tributary Strategy Region ___ USGS 8 Digit ___ MD 6 Digit ___ MD 8 Digit _X_ MD 12 Digit ___ Adaptable to Any Scale ___ Other ___ Data Custodian: Tidewater Ecosystem Assessments/RAS/DNR Clean Water Goal: Yes ___ No _X_ Other Natural Resource Goal: Yes ____ No _X_ Assumptions: _________________________________________________________________ Tidal Water Quality "Habitat Status" Data Layer - continued Comments: While we have attempted to meet the needs of the INRA/UWA assessment by providing tidal water and habitat quality data in a useful way through scored indices, we have concerns about the usefulness of the resulting scores.
Some of these concerns include: C Use of relative status: The assignment of status scores to most of the individual parameters (chlorophyll a, and Secchi depth) that are incorporated into the two indices is done using a relative scale, so they are of less usefulness in targeting restoration needs (because they are not based on numeric goals) C The consolidation of data in overly simplistic indices: The combination of the individual parameters into the indices was done as a first-cut for the purposes of reducing the number of parameters reported to the modeling group by doing a first-level assessment of the data.
The resulting indices are new, and therefore untested, and we recommend strongly that as the INRA/UWA process continues, the resulting assessments should be compared to determine consistency with established watershed assessments such as the 305b Report.

Individual components trends were scored based on significance and direction from score of 1 (highly significant degrading trend) to 10 (highly significant improving trend) and then combined into an overall index mean by station.

Finally, these 8-digit watershed means were averaged within larger drainage basins (for the Potomac, Patuxent, Choptank, Nanticoke, and Elk Rivers).
From this last step, multiple 8digit watersheds are given the same overall index INRA/UWA score to reflect the interactions of watersheds upstream and downstream of each other within a tributary basin.
For the UWA, watersheds are placed in Category I (needs restoration) if they are scored less than 5 (degrading trends).

Individual components status scores were converted to a score of 1 (most degraded) to 10 (best condition) and then combined into an overall index mean by station.
For 8-digit watersheds that included more than one station, these overall index means by station were then averaged to determine the watershed mean (which is the same as the overall index mean when only one station is in an 8-digit watershed).
Finally, these 8-digit watershed means were averaged within larger drainage basins (for the Potomac, Patuxent, Choptank, Nanticoke, and Elk Rivers).
From this last step, multiple 8-digit watersheds are given the same overall index INRA/UWA score to reflect the interactions of watersheds upstream and downstream of each other within a tributary basin.
For the UWA, watersheds are placed in Category I (needs restoration) if they are in the lower 25% of scores for the 138 watersheds for the Eutrophication Status Index.
Watersheds are placed in Category II (needs preventative action) if they have scores in the higher 75% of scores for the 138 watersheds.
Because no system is considered to be pristine, none of the watersheds are placed in Category III (pristine watersheds).

Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) population health is determined by measuring the extent of areas with SAV growth each year.
SAV coverage is assessed from aerial surveys and quantified by Chesapeake Bay Program segments using digital techniques.
These coverage estimates are compared to the SAV Restoration Goals to determine progress towards restoration of healthy SAV populations

Each tributary has its own SAV Restoration Goals (in hectacres) which are based on the amount of area expected to be available for SAV growth, determined by water depth, physical characteristics, and historic occurrence of SAV.

This value was multiplied by 10 to yield a value between 0 and 10.
If this value was less than 1, 1 was used as the index, as INRA/UWA requires a non-zero value.
With a few exceptions (see "Methods used for Tidal Water Quality, SAV, Benthic IBI and Fish IBI data consolidation for the INRA/UWA project" for more information), the mean of the indices for the bay segments that were pooled together was used.
For the UWA, watersheds are placed in Category I (needs restoration) if they have SAV coverage of 10% or less of the Tier III target area (index score of 1) Watersheds are placed in Category II (needs preventative action) if they have SAV coverage of more than 10% of the Tier III target area (index score greater than 1).

Each parameter was weighted as to its importance to SAV and passing failing and borderline value were assigned by the following scale: Parameter Secchi depth Dissolved inorganic nitrogen Dissolved inorganic phosphorus Chlorophyll a Total suspended solids Passing 2 1 1 1 1 Borderline 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 Failing 0 0 0 0 0 The values were summed and divided by the total score possible (six in mesohaline and polyhaline areas, and five in tidal fresh and oligohaline regiond since dissolved inorganic nitrogen is not a habitat requirement in these areas).
This quotient was then multiplied by 10 to yield a value between 0 and 10.
Indices less than 1 were changed to 1.
With a few exceptions (see "Methods used for Tidal Water Quality, SAV, Benthic IBI and Fish IBI data consolidation"), the mean of the indices for the bay segments were pooled and used.
For the UWA, watersheds are placed in Category I (needs restoration) if they are scored less than 7.
Watersheds are placed in Category II (needs preventative action) if they are scored 7 or higher, which is only possible if secchi depth is at least "borderline" and at least 3 of the remaining 4 (in mesohaline and polyhaline areas ) or 2 or the remaining 3 (in tidal fresh and oligohaline areas) other habitat requirements are "passing" and the last one at least is "borderline".
Please note: the numbers in the table above are used to score the individual segments as a first step, which is then standardized to a scale of 1 to 10 by dividing the initial score by the number of habitat requirements that apply (in some areas only four habitat requirements apply; dissolved inorganic nitrogen habitat requirements do not apply in tidal fresh and oligohaline areas).
The score of 7 is the standardized score which was reported for the data layer.

The Chesapeake Bay Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) evaluates whether the benthic community at a site meets the Restoration Goals, scoring on measures of species diversity, species composition, productivity, and trophic composition (Ranasinghe et al. 1997).
Un-impacted reference site attributes were used to define Restoration Goals scales for each type of benthic habitat found in the Chesapeake Bay with the exception of the tidal fresh habitat.
Specific numerical ranges are established for three categories for each criteria measured: scores are based on whether the community approximates (a score of 5), deviates slightly from (a score of 3) or deviates strongly from (a score of 1) the characteristics of the attribute at the best reference sites (Weisburg et al. 1997).

These individual attribute scores are then averaged to determine the Benthic IBI (B-IBI).
Communities with a B-IBI of 3.0 or greater are classified as meeting the Restoration Goals, sites with B-IBIs greater than 2.6 but less than 3.0 are classified as marginal, sites with B-IBIs from 2 to 2.6 are classified as degraded, and sites with B-IBIs less than or equal to 2 are classified as severely degraded.
Status is defined as the overall current (most recent three years) B-IBI score for each station.
For the INRA/UWA project, Benthic IBI current status were assessed to provide a score on the scale from 1 (most severely degraded) to 10 (meets goals-highest quality).
A mean of the B-IBI status INRA/UWA scores was calculated by station.
For 8-digit watersheds that included more than one station, these means by station were then averaged to determine the watershed mean (which is the same as the overall index mean when only one station is in an 8-digit watershed).
Finally, these 8-digit watershed means were averaged within larger drainage basins (for the Potomac, Patuxent and Choptank Rivers).
From this last step, multiple 8digit watersheds are given the same overall index INRA/UWA score to reflect the interactions of watersheds upstream and downstream of each other within a tributary.

Multiple sites are sampled on each river system.
Abundance by species is calculated.
These data are summed for the entire season and reduced to metrics: total number of species, number of species comprising 90% of the catch, number of species in the bottom trawl, anadromous fish abundance, estuarine fish abundance, total fish abundance less menhaden, proportion of planktivores, proportion of carnivores, proportion of benthivores Data Source: Maryland Department of Natural Resources Resource Assessment Service, Index of Biotic Integrity sampling program Data Type: Condition _X_ Stressor ___ Vulnerability ___ Trend ___ Growth ___ Other ___ Method of Calculation: These data are transformed to achieve normality.
Data are ranked into terciles and assign a score of 1 if in the lower third of the distribution, 3 in the middle third, and 5 in the upper third.
These ranks are summed to yield the IBI score.
A distribution of the IBI scores was examined.
Scores representing the 75th, 50th, and 25th percentiles of the distribution were output.
Sites were distributed based on these rankings into groups, where group 3 represented any scores in the upper 25th percentile of the distribution, group 2 scores falling between the 25th and 75th percentiles, and group 1 if scores fell in the lower 25th percentile of the distribution.
Tests of significance showed that the groupings were significantly different (p=.0001), and that the groupings were significant from one another.
For the INRA/UWA project, a ranking of 2 infers severe disturbance in the fish community, a 5 moderate, and an 8 minimal.
For the UWA, watersheds are placed in Category I (needs restoration) if they are in the lower 25% of scores for the applicable watersheds for the Estuarine Fish IBI.
Watersheds are placed in Category II (needs preventative action) if they have scores in the middle 2674 % of scores for the applicable watersheds.
Watersheds are placed in Category III (pristine watersheds) if they have scores in the highest 25% of scores for the applicable watersheds.

We have seen that the upstream areas (areas closer to the upper part of the watershed - near to the source?) show more disturbance based on the fish community than areas nearer to the mouth of the watershed where main bay effects may buffer the disturbance that is causing fish community disruptions.
This was a quick and dirty exercise that could be developed into a more robust measure that assesses individual measures of the fish community.
For example, we may be able to develop measures more specific to recreationally and commercially important species.
We could integrate more of the fisheries data (landings, stock assessments) and develop trends using these data.
We could also examine trends in community measures and developing a ranking scheme on these.
These measures would certainly give a more robust assessment of the condition of the entire fish community in relation to the watershed.

Data Source: Assateague Island National Seashore Water Quality Monitoring Program and EPA Joint Assessment (Challiou 1996) Data Type: Condition Method of Calculation: The same methods were used as described in the "Methods used for Tidal Water Quality, SAV, Benthic IBI and Fish IBI data consolidation for the INRA/UWA project" for tidal water and habitat status indexes with the following exceptions: A. Data from the National Park Service, Assateague Island National Seashore, was used as the benchmark dataset to determine a relative scale for the coastal bays (univariate analysis was used to determine the 5th and 95th percentiles - e.g. "good and poor endpoints").
The timeframe of this benchmark dataset was 1987 - 1997.
This data only included data from Sinepuxent, Newport and Chincoteague Bay watersheds.
B.
It was not necessary to calculate median values for station, month, year combinations as there were never more than one value for each station-time combination.
The median value for each parameter and station during the 1994 - 1996 period was used in the following equation: X* = ((X - "poor endpoint")/("good endpoint" - "poor endpoint")) x 100 C. Due to limited data availability for dissolved oxygen, only chlorophyll a and secchi depth were used to determine the habitat status index.
D. Water Quality Status Indexes for the northern coastal bays (Assawoman and Isle of Wight) were determined from aerial weighted mean values collected during the summer of 1996 (Challiou 1996).
This was done due to the lack of data for the full 1994 - 1996 period in these bays.
Similar data existed for Newport and Chincoteague Bays.
Indexes for these bays were determined for both datasets and were highly comparable.
E.
To determine the cutoff values for placement of watersheds into Category I (needs restoration), II (needs preservation) or III (pristine) index scores were determined for the 25 and 75 percentiles.
Watershed indexes that fell above the 25 percentile index were considered pristine (category III), those that fell between were considered Category II and those that were above the 25 percentile index were considered Category I.

Data Used in the Clean Water Action Plan Unified Watershed Assessment Name of Data Layer: Modeled Total Nitrogen or Phosphorus Delivered to the Bay Definition (General Description): These values include nitrogen loadings for both point and nonpoint sources delivered to the Chesapeake Bay and are represented in pounds per watershed acre.
Data Source: The Chesapeake Bay Program's Phase IV Watershed model (WSM) and the Department of Natural Resource's Integrated Watershed Analysis and Management System (IWAMS).
Data Type: Condition _X_ Stressor ___ Vulnerability ___ Trend ___ Growth ___ Other ___ Method of Calculation: The Watershed Model divides the Chesapeake Bay's 64,000 square mile drainage basin into about 100 model segments.
Each segment contains information generated by a hydrologic submodel, a nonpoint source submodel, and a river submodel.
The hydrologic submodel uses rainfall, evaporation, and meteorological data to calculate runoff and subsurface flow for all the basin land uses including forest, agricultural lands, and urban lands.
The surface and sub surface flow ultimately drive the nonpoint source submodel which simulates soil erosion and the pollutant loads from the land to the rivers.
The river submodel routes flow and associated pollutant loads from the land through the lakes, rivers, and reservoirs to the Bay.
Please refer to the "Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model Application and Calculation of Nutrient and Sediment Loads", Appendices A through H, for more detailed explanations.

Percentages of impervious surface by type of developed land were used based on U.S. Soil Conservation Service TR-55 Manual.
Percentages assigned to land use classifications were: 12% for large lot residential, 25% for low density residential, 38% for medium density residential, 65% for high density residential, 85% for industrial, 72% for commercial and other urban uses, and 98% for barren.
The general formuala used to derive impervious surface acreage is acres of land classified in that use times percent of impervious surface for that use.
Acres of impervious surface total includes acres for each estimated use in a watershed.

Impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots and roof-tops prevent infiltration of rain into groundwater and speed its runoff into surface waters.
This not only contributes to flooding, erosion and channel modification at the time of the rainfall event but also can result in the reduction of summer base flow from groundwater.
Reduced summer flows in turn have negative impacts on aquatic life.

Assumptions: _________________________________________________________________ Comments: Can be normalized by total stream corridor area (i.e., - percent of stream corridor not vegetated).
Riparian forest is important not only for its ability to buffer streams from the pollution impacts of adjacent land use activities but for the habitat values it provides to both aquatic communities (e.g., food, temperature regulation, bank stability, snags for shelter) and terrestrial communities, for which it can serve both a "local" and a migration corridor function.
Riparian wetlands similarly provide important habitat as well as hydrologic functions.

Data Source: Natural Soil Groups of MD, Office of Planning (OP) 1994 Land Use/Land Cover Data Data Type: Condition _X_ Stressor ___ Vulnerability ___ Trend ___ Growth ___ Other ___ Method of Calculation: Four ArcView datalayers were created and overlaid to develop a soil erodibility value for the 8-digit watersheds in MD.
These datalayers included the soil erodibility factor (K), the slope steepness, a stream layer with a 1000' buffer and land areas identified as cropland.
The soil erodibility factors were assigned to the Natural Soil Group using Table 1.
Estimated Physical and Chemical Properties in Natural Soil Groups of MD Technical Series Report December 1973.
Slope was also assigned using the Natural Soils Group properties.
The stream datalayer with the 1000' buffer was created using MD streams datalayer and using XTOOLS in ArcView to create a 1000' buffer.
The cropland layer was created using MD OP land use cover.
The composite value of these layers was normalized and the values were classified into 5 groups using the natural breaks method in ArcView.
The classifications high and very high for soil erodibility (corresponding to a numeric value between 0.275 - 0.314 and 0.314 - 0.370, respectively) were used to assign a watershed to the Category 1 rating for this indicator.
