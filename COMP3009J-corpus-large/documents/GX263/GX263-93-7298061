We choose to define our habitat as a place where we like to live.
We live in cities, suburbia, and the country.
All in all, the Hudson Valley is a beautiful place to live, but the clear cut lines between these environs are becoming increasingly hazy.
Suburbia, ever spreading, is changing our landscape, as populations increase, as people become more mobile and combined with the ever present desire for a piece of the American dream (home ownership), farms and open space are under attack.
The serenity of the country is harder to find.
This brings me to my point.
Stony Kill is an "island of sanity", amongst this urban sprawl; seven hundred and fifty six acres of green space, paths and peace.
Come walk the trails, look for blue birds, or take a child fishing.
Find your "roots."
In today's' tremotulous life style, Stony Kill offers a repose, a place where you can gather your thoughts and catch a days breath.
Enjoy! If you have been wondering what all that activity is on Stony Kill and Red Schoolhouse Roads, look no further for we are building new parking lots.
Off of Stony Kill Road the Freedom trail will have immediate access, while the parking lot off of Red Schoolhouse Road will provide a path to Mueller Pond.
In addition to Stony Kill's grounds being open seven days a week, sunrise to sunset, our offices are now open seven days a week (except major holidays) for your enjoyment.
Stony Kill Almanac is a quarterly newsletter of Stony Kill Farm Environmental Education Center.

Model Railroaders Volunteer for SKF The Olde Newburgh Model Railroad Club, in existence since 1940, presently meets every Wednesday evening in the VFW in Walden, New York.
The twenty active members, men, women, retired, not retired, a few youngsters too, all have one thing in common Â­ they love trains! The club has two layouts in the VFW, one "HO" gauge and the other, even smaller model trails, "N" gauge.
In addition, there is a "traveling layout" the members take to shows and special exhibits.
Of course, individual members often have their own layouts in their homes.
The members enjoy planning and building, revising and viewing their intricate layouts of trains of all types with villages, industries, mountain scenery, you name it, they've probably got it! So what's this got to do with Stony Kill? Our environmental education center received a grant from the Catskill Watershed Corporation to develop a watershed model and other educational materials for public education presentations.
We needed some volunteers who liked to build models, scenery, and already had knowledge in this area, and we definitely found the right group! After calling a few other such clubs we spoke to Peter King of Wappingers Falls, a member of ONMRC and he presented the idea to the group.
To make a long story short by several months later member, Ed Miller, became the coordinator of the project.
Ed started in August in his basement in Highland, NY and spent at least six hours a week and now has over 100 hours of volunteer service! He also had assistance from Ted Lippincott, Mr and Mrs. Ed Miller unveil the watershed model for staff member and environmental educator, Ralph Jenkins, and Christopher O'Sullivan (middle) who was involved in coordinating the project.
Mike Callan, also members of the ONMRC.
The grant paid for materials for the project and all the labor was donated with enthusiasm and dedication.
The Catskill Watershed model depicts the topography of the land from the Catskill's reservoirs to New York City, showing the mountains, rivers, major features, and locations of several pertinent sites, such as Stony Kill Farm.
A terrific job was done by these gentlemen.
The model was designed to be portable, as well as to allow the presenter to demonstrate the way the water supply travels from the reservoirs many miles away to New York City faucets.
It will be a very useful educational tool for our visiting New York City school children participating in Operation Explore, as well as many other presentations by our environmental educators.
As they say in the classroom Â­ good job, men! And THANK YOU! By: Carolyn Plage, Volunteer Coordinator

Here are some fun facts to help you get to know this helpful and misunderstood animal.
One bat can eat 600 mosquitos in one hour! Little Brown Bats can catch up to 1200 insects in one hour! A bat's knees are backwards so that it can hang upside down.
Less than half of one percent of bats have rabies.
You are more likely to be hurt by a dog or bee than a bat! Bats can tell the difference between a strand of hair and a gnat at night, the won't get caught in your hair! More than 50% of American bat species are in decline or listed as endangered.
Keep pesky mosquitos away by inviting bats to live nearby! Building bat boxes can be a fun experiment for the whole family.
Some folks paint the top of the box a dark color and the bottom white so that the bats can have warm and cool spots inside.
You can learn more cool tricks like this and get plans to build a box by visiting Stony Kill Farm or these web sites: www.batcon.org and www.lads.com
Q: All! But only the bat eats just insects.
