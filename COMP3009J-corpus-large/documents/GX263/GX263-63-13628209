A Battle for Survival? The Real Story Behind Low Oil Prices A Report of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission April 1999 Introduction In December 1998, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) first alerted the nation and its policy-makers about the effects of low oil prices.
At the time, the nation had not awakened to the possible long-term impact of low oil prices on a wide variety of stakeholders.
With gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel and diesel prices hovering at record low levels, consumers and energy-intensive industries pocketed billions in savings.
In the glow of low gasoline prices, few policymakers were willing to stand up for the conservation of nonrenewable domestic oil.
Meanwhile, domestic oil and natural gas producers, royalty owners, governments that receive taxes, and Throughout the history of those who owe their employment to the industry were warning U.S. energy policy, important of an industry in crisis.

for future generations.
Throughout the history of U.S. energy policy, important decisions are often made in reaction to crises.
Short-term, piecemeal actions will most certainly prolong some segments of the vital domestic exploration and production industry.
Still needed will be the resolve and visionary policy that ensure energy security for future generations.
For nearly 65 years, the IOGCC has been the worlds leading advocate for the conservation of oil and natural gas resources.
By ensuring efficient and effective drilling and production practices, IOGCC member states are committed to minimizing the loss of these irreplaceable natural resources.
The result has been recovery of billions of barrels of domestic oil that otherwise would have been lost.
Despite the states best efforts, the country is losing a critical segment of the domestic industry production from low-volume, marginal wells.
Taken singularly, each well is of little significance, producing, on average, only about two barrels of oil per day.
Collectively, however, they comprise an important hedge against increasing reliance on imports and are a cornerstone industry for hundreds of rural communities.
They provide tens of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in payments to landowners, royalty owners and government.
Yet thousands of these wells are in jeopardy.
As low prices continue to shut down marginal production in the United States, each barrel lost will be replaced by imported oil.
When marginal wells are plugged, production ends permanently.
Higher volume wells and exploratory drilling programs are also affected as reduced cash flow forces operators to cut back across the board.
The domestic exploration and production industry is also losing the critical personnel infrastruc1
ture that would allow it to respond to improved economic conditions.
At every level, oil producers are losing expertise and experience.
Research and development into new technologies that prolong production have slowed.
The implications for national security and the economy are serious.
In the event of a prolonged curtailment of imported oil, the crippled domestic industry would be hardpressed to respond swiftly and decisively.
This report examines the impact of low oil prices on state economies, the domestic industry and other stakeholders.
A major portion of the information provided is the result of a survey of states conducted by the IOGCC.
(A copy of the survey appears as Attachment A.) States that responded represent diverse production levels and geographic locations.
Other information was provided by various governmental entities, trade journals and associations, newspapers and IOGCC publications.
Background The United States continues to rely heavily on petroleum as its major energy source.
Demand is projected to grow at 1.2 percent per year through 2020, with 70 percent of the total used for transportation fuel, including gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel.1 Oil currently provides 97 percent of the countrys Producing U.S. Oil We lls, 1997 transportation fuel.
The U.S. oil and gas industry is particularly susceptible to long periods of low crude oil prices because 137,000 about three-fourths of the nations oil wells are marginally Othe r We lls profitable.
About 436,000 of the nations 573,000 oil wells 2, 3 produce less than 10 barrels per day.
On average, these Str ipp e r We lls low-volume stripper wells produce 2.2 barrels per day.2 At these quantities, low crude oil prices might not cover production costs.
During periods of low prices, these 436,000 wells are often idled, operated only sporadically to meet minimum lease requirements, or plugged and abandoned.
Marginal wells are particularly at risk during periods of low oil prices.
These wells provide about 25 percent of the domestic crude oil production, excluding Alaska and federal offshore.4 Higher volume wells may also be affected if low prices linger.
As revenue for domestic producers falls, cutbacks in exploration and production expenditures usually occur; corresponding taxes for state, federal and local economies decline; royalty revenues decrease; employment in the energy industry and supporting services falls; and imports rise.
Since the mid-1980s, domestic petroleum production had By December 1998, domesbeen steadily declining until 1995, when it became relatively flat. tic production had fallen Then, in the first quarter of 1998, swiftly declining prices began about 500,000 barrels per to take their toll.

production in the Gulf of Mexico.
If prices recover only slowly as shown in our current base case forecast, the cumulative loss in production between 1997 and 2001 would be another threequarters to 1 million barrels per day, on top of the 2.5 million barrel decline we have seen between 1985 and 1997.
Under these circumstances, imports would increase at least another 1 million barrels per day over the 5 million barrels per day increase that occurred between 1985 and 1997.5 In January 1999, U.S. crude oil production fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years.6 2
Impact on Employment in the Industry In the past 15 years, the domestic production industry has changed dramatically.
In 1982, 1.9 million people were employed in the oil and gas industry.
By December 1998, total employment was 1.4 million.6 In the last quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999, announcements of job cuts became alarmingly commonplace.

There are not enough experienced geoscientists and petroleum technology people available to hire today.
Any crisis in oil supply causing increases in domestic activity will be constrained by lack of qualified staff.
During the downturn, as jobs were lost, academic enrollments in geosciences and petroleum technology suffered.
Academic institutions, faced with significant budget shortfalls owing to decreased enrollments and increased costs, dropped lower-productive curricula, such as geology and petroleum engineering, despite the well-known cyclicity of the petroleum job market.8 As a result of generally poor job prospects in the past few years, the number of students enrolling in geology and geophysics has dropped considerably.9 Employment of petroleum engineers is expected to decline through the year 2006 unless oil and gas prices unexpectedly rise enough to encourage increased exploration for oil in this country.

8 The domestic oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on small independent operators, as opposed to large, integrated companies.
Many of the major oil companies are concentrating their expenditures abroad.
Independent oil and gas operators drilled 85 percent of the domestic wells, producing 45 percent of the crude oil and 88 percent of domestic gas.12

Since independent producers account for the majority of lower 48 onshore production (almost 60 percent in 1997), they are likely to bear a larger portion of the U.S. production decline than the major oil companies.5 Although independents range in size from small one-to-two person companies up to very large public firms, the typical independent is a highly efficient small-business owner who has been established for many years.11 Typical marginal well operators handle 13 oil wells and rely Typical marginal well operaon these properties for 37 percent of the family income.

Robert McDougal, president of Phoenix Production in Cody, Wyoming, is typical of the producers hurting on many levels.
Ive shut in 25 percent of my production and could shut it all in, but need to keep my people working so that I dont lose them, McDougal said.
There was not a lot of infrastructure left in the domestic industry before this (period of low oil prices) and now we are just being devastated.
I had 17 employees and let three go in February 1998, anticipating low prices for several months.
Now, Im just trying to protect those remaining employees so that I will be able to operate if prices ever recover.
My average price for the year was less than $10 per barrel and one lease this summer paid $3.80.
This is taking a real toll on solid independent operators.
Economic Impact on States Several states raise substantial income from taxes generated by oil and gas activities.

Some states have acted in response to low oil prices.
In the spring of 1998, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating convened an Emergency Energy Task Force.
The trend of Oklahoma crude hovering at $12 a barrel is potentially crippling to the 70,000 stripper wells in our state.
There are immediate steps that can and will be taken and I want this team to look at other options to give these producers a safety net as the oil prices plummet, Keating wrote.
Its not just an energy issue Its not just an energy issue but an issue crucial to but an issue crucial to Oklahomas economy.

production occurs.
Thus petroleum production is a significant contributor to the economic health of rural Oklahoma.
Each lease should be viewed as a small business in the area where the production occurs.
The loss of a lease is just as significant as the loss of any local business.13 Gov. Keating called a special session of the Oklahoma Legislature in early 1999 to deal specifically with the oil price crisis.
As a result, a tiered reduction in the states severance tax rate will provide about $29 million in tax relief for 1999 and $35 million in 2000.
This bill, in itself, will not save the oil industry, Keating said.
But it certainly will assist operators and mineral owners through this struggle.
The oil industry is one of Oklahomas most vital of job providers and tax providers.
Let us remember just this past summer, when our agriculture community needed help we put together Operation Hay Lift to help our farmers and ranchers with their cattle during the drought.
Now it is the oil industrys turn.
Oklahomas oil industry employs tens of thousands of Oklahomans.
Not only is this a bedrock industry in our state, it is also essential that we keep as many producing wells operating as possible to prevent additional future dependence on foreign oil.16 Wyoming Gov.

Impact on Consumers In the short term, low oil prices have benefited many consumers.
The most widely recognized benefit is low gasoline prices at the pump.
Recent prices are at their lowest inflation-adjusted level in more than 20 years.21 Over the past six months, free market Gasoline Price Breakdown forces and weathernotably, the Asian Economic Flu and El NiÃ±ohave brought about a dramatic plunge in world oil wellhead values.

The biggest beneficiaries, of course, are everyday consumers, who buy more refined oil products than does any single American industry.

. .In the first nine months of 1998, the carrier spent $604 million on fuel and utilities, down $162 million, or 21 percent.25 Lower transportation costs mean lower prices on everything from food to fertilizer.

record high levels, lower prices have helped slow the growth of the U.S. trade deficit.
The deficit totaled $17.1 billion in November, down from $17.3 billion a year ago.23 However, with imported crude oil capturing an increasing share of the U.S. market, the deficit could jump dramatically when oil prices rebound.
While low oil prices have been credited with helping the economy, there appears to be general agreement that rising prices would not trigger inflation.
Higher oil prices wont wake the sleeping forces of inflation, at least not at these levels.

prices of benchmark crude up nearly 50 percent since the fall, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries making a bid to further strengthen prices with production cuts, it is no wonder that some people are getting jittery . . .
But many economists dont expect inflation to come roaring back to life just yet.
Most are betting that as long as oil doesnt go through the $20-per-barrel level, the U.S. economy can keep its balance between speedy economic growth and low inflation.28 Fred Breimyer, economist at State Street Bank and Trust Co. in New York, said even if higher oil prices stick, the dampening effect on U.S. consumer spending will not be large because there are a lot of other things, such as a strong job market and rising real incomes, that are prompting consumers to go out and shop.
Even if you get pricing of crude oil moving up to $15 a barrel from $10, the percentage increase for consumers is not onerous, Breimyer said.29 Speaking about the recent uptick in oil prices, (U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert) Rubin said this would not spark new inflationary dangers in the United States.
Nothing that has happened so far with respect to oil prices, it seems to me, would in any way change my judgment that the most likely prospect with respect to inflation is continued low inflation.

Impact on Industry Several publications and industry associations have documented the impact of lower oil prices on company balance sheets.
Petroleum company stocks were hard hit.
From the end of 1996 to the end of 1998, John S. Herold, Inc. notes oil prices plunged by $15 per barrel, or 54 percent, and natural gas has done only slightly better, falling 80 cents per MMBtu, or 30 percent.
Based on these poor fundamentals, one would have expected oil and gas shares to have lagged the broad market, said the firm.
In fact, the returns can nearly be described as catastrophically bad.

Bankruptcy courts say filings began pouring (in 1999). in during the second half of 1998, and the pace has accelerated this year.41 Especially at risk are smaller producers.
Non-major producers can be especially vulnerable, financially, during an oil price collapse, for several reasons.
First, non-major oil and gas producers tend to finance their operations more heavily with debt than the majors do.
In the event of an oil price decline, producers with more debt may have more difficulty making their payments.
Second, for those oil and gas producers that specialize in this line of business, poor profit rates cannot be offset by stronger returns in other business activities.
Third, very lowvolume producers may have special difficulties covering their production costs.42 In addition to layoffs, the decline in earnings has reduced exploration and production budgets across the board.
For the third quarter of 1998, completions of oil wells, natural gas wells and dry holes declined by 18 percent, compared with the same period last year.
In the third quarter, oil well completions declined 25 percent to 2,361.

Gas is being positioned as the bridge fuel between now and the next generation of cleaner fuels.
However, we have very serious concerns that the very low oil prices of today may substantially impact the industrys ability to deliver that gas.
People are subsidizing their oil wells right now with their gas production, but the implications for the future are scary.45 Companies ability to raise capital for drilling and completion programs also has been affected.
While low oil prices made tapping debt and equity markets trying for much of the year, recent turmoil in global markets now appears to be shutting down capital markets entirely for most (energy) firms.
Energy concerns raised just $7.7 billion in capital markets during the third quarter, the lowest total since the third quarter of 1996 . .
.46 Independent companies, pinched by lower stock prices and reduced cash flow, also are finding it more difficult to obtain loans, analysts say.
47 Energy companies have cut their spending plans this year and that will probably carry over into their budgets for leasing drilling sites, analysts say.
John Selser, analyst at Lehman Brothers in Houston, said the independent companies have cut spending involuntarily.
Companies have less money to spend because their cash flow from oil and gas sales is down.

The company says there probably are fewer domestic rigs drilling for oil and gas now than at any time since the industrys emerging days of the early 1900s.49 11
Impact on the Federal Government The federal government felt a tangible effect of the current petroleum price slump through the depressed prices paid for federal leasesas evidenced by the results of a lease sale in March 1999.
The U.S. Interior Department said Wednesday its oil block sale in the Gulf of Mexico attracted $200 million in bids, about $1 billion less than last year, as companies cut spending in the face of low energy prices.50 The August 1998 auction of leases in the Gulf of Mexico had already begun to reflect an industry slowdown.
The August 1998 auction of Bids dropped sharply for the latest auction of offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico petroleum leases in the western Gulf of Mexico, mostly near the reflected an industry slowcoast of Texas.
A total of 486 bids for 402 tracts in the western down with only 486 bids for Gulf were received for todays sale by the Minerals Management 402 tracts received by the U.S. Service.

High bids for that sale a sharp decrease from the totaled $616.2 million.
August 1997 sale.
Until now, the number of bids for federal leases in the Gulf had been skyrocketing, along with renewed interest in offshore exploration, including deep water.47 President Clintons budget shows a decrease of $1.4 billion between 1998 and 1999 in rents and royalties from the Outer Continental Shelf, and a decline of $80 million from previous 1999 estimates of onshore rents and royalties.51
Impact on National Security . . . the reduction in exploration, dwindling reserves, falling production, and the relatively high cost of U.S. production all point toward a contraction of the U.S. petroleum industry and increasing imports from Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sources.
Growing import dependence, in turn, increases U.S. vulnerability to a supply disruption because non-OPEC sources lack surge production capacity; and there are at present no substitutes for oil-based transportation fuels.
Given the above factors, the Department finds that petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security.
U.S. Department of Commerce, December 1994 I am today concurring with the Department of Commerces finding that the nations growing reliance on imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products threaten the nations security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to oil supply interruptions.
I also concur with the Departments recommendation that the Administration continue its present efforts to improve U.S. energy security, rather than to adopt a specific import adjustment mechanism.
President Bill Clinton, February 1995 According to a poll taken by the Sustainable Energy Coalition, more than four out of five registered voters believe that the United States is still vulnerable to an energy crisis.
The poll . . . shows that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that rising oil imports are a threat to our economic, environmental and national security, said Bill Richardson, U.S. Secretary of Energy.52 A vivid reminder of the fragile nature of U.S. dependence on imported oil can be found in the EIAs World Oil Potential Hot Spots.
In December 1998, those hot spots included Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Indonesia and East Asia.
Each of these countries is experiencing political, eco12
nomic and/or diplomatic uncertainty that could significantly affect their oil sector.53 In researching its report to the president cited above, the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC) found that the level of foreign oil imports posed a threat to national security.
At that time (1995), imports comprised about 50 percent of the United States consumption.
In 1998, gross imports had risen to 53 percent.
Despite advances in technology that have lowered finding costs and increased recovery rates from known reserves, domestic oil production has fallen.
Future projections indicate further growth in oil imports.
Declining (domestic) production and rising demand lead to increasing petroleum imports through 2020.
The share of petroleum consumption met by net imports In 1995, when the U.S. Derises from 49 percent in 1997 to 65 percent; however, the share partment of Commerce found is higher earlier in the projection period because of lower that the level of foreign oil domestic production.1 imports posed a threat to Make no mistake about it: the world oil market is not a national security, imports free market as the Administration frequently suggests.

imports rose to 53 percent.
In 1995, the Clinton Administration concluded that our current import level represented a threat to national security, but it concluded that the threat could be met by diversifying import sources.
It is a flawed strategy.
Diversity is not security.
Today, we import twice as much oil on a percentage basis from the OPEC countries that embargoed us in 1973.
If we build our energy lifeline on foreign, particularly Middle Eastern oil, we are placing our economic future in the hands of rogue nations like Iraq.54 Cheap oil might merely aggravate the twin evils of corruption and bad government.
The bigger fear is that consumers will one day suffer, too.
Hydrocarbons and political volatility seem to go together.
The Middle East has the worlds cheapest and most abundant reserves of high-quality oil.
Russia supplies most of Western Europes natural gas.
The dependence that this implies has been obscured in the past decade because OPECs high prices in the 1970s and 1980s paid for the development of oil and gas fields in such expensive regions as the North Sea.
But low oil prices will gradually put most such areas out of businessespecially if cash strapped Gulf states conclude that the best way to increase revenues is to boost production, which could drive prices from todays $10 to as little as $5.
The world will then again depend on a few Middle Eastern countries for half its oil, up Estimates regarding the true from a quarter now.55 cost of imported oil vary Estimates regarding the true cost of imported oil vary widely.

contingent in the Gulf.
This does not include the additional billions which we spent to pay for the bombing cost of Desert Fox and the continuing daily effort in Iraq.
Why should American taxpayers pay these costs? Why shouldnt Persian Gulf oil pay for the cost for its own defense? The real cost to the American taxpayer for oil imported from the countries of the Persian Gulf includes the cost of maintaining stability in the region.
How much are we really paying for Persian Gulf oil? This can be calculated by dividing $50 by 2.5 million barrels per day multiplied by one year.
(In 1998 13
U.S. imports averaged less than 2.5 million barrels of oil per day from the Persian Gulf.)
Therefore, Persian Gulf oil cost U.S. taxpayers about $54 per barrel plus the purchase price.
The total cost is about $65 per barrel.56 The cost of the three days of operations for Desert Fox were reportedly nearly $1 billion.57 California independents pay as taxpayers $2 per barrel for every barrel they produce in expenses to keep Saudi Arabia and Kuwait free to sell gasoline around the U.S. for $1 per gallon or lower.
This is an economic transfer payment, from independents to OPEC and their major oil company partners.61

Impact on Private Royalty Owners Across the nation, there are millions of royalty owners who benefit directly from the production of oil and natural gas.
Royalty owners own the mineral rights (but not always the surface land from which the petroleum is extracted) and are paid an income by the company that produces the petroleum.
In general, the amount they receive is based on the value of the oil or gas produced.
Less production, sold at a lower cost, results in a significant reduction in the income of the nations royalty owners.
Producers and royalty owners are Siamese twins, joined at the pocketbook.63 Income to these royalty ownerswhich include states with production on public lands or in state waters, the federal government with production on public lands or offshore, and other mineral interest ownersaverages 15 percent of the value of gross production.
For 1997, royalties generated $6.15 billion in the United States.3 Royalty owners are at the mercy of the market, said Bill Goodwin of Nashville, Tennessee.
My royalty income is about half what it was before, but there is nothing royalty owners can do about that.
1997 Royalt y 1998 Pr edicted Owne r Inc ome Royalt y Owner Although nationwide statistics are not available, the $6.15 billion Incom e National Association of Royalty Owners (NARO) estimates $3.075 billion that the average royalty check to Oklahomas 200,000 oil royalty owners dropped by 50 percent during 1998.
The effect Source: Independent Petroleum Association of America of this reduction was felt statewide, as royalty owners contribute to state treasuries by paying gross production taxes in addition to personal taxes on their royalty revenue.
NARO reports that the average age of a royalty owner is over 65, and 65 percent are women.
Although monthly royalty checks are usually well under $200, they are an important source of income to cope with the expenses of advancing age.64 15
An earlier survey showed among the top five destinations of royalty bonuses and income: 1) education of children and kin; 2) improvements to farms and ranches; 3) pay down of home mortgages; 4) savings for retirement and for future medical bills and emergencies, and; 5) to retire debts.63 Oklahoma royalty owner Julia A. Short gave congressional members a picture of how low oil prices have affected her in February 1999 testimony before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Oversight of the House Committee on Ways and Means In 1997, my total royalty income was a little over $8,600.
In 1998, it dropped to around $5,300.
Thats a forty percent Royalty income has sustained drop in one year for someone already living near the so-called countless families, small farms, poverty level.
There are approximately 200,000 other Oklahoranches and rural towns for mans in the same boat who depend on investments or assets in decades.
Royalty dollars oil and gas mineral royalties, with 4.5 million royalty owners circulate many times through a nationally, scattered across every state of the union . . .

services to the elderly.
When those dollars disappear, whole communities can be financially devastated.
Family farms are sold to giant ag corporations.
The elderly and infirm lose their self-sufficiency and become dependent on public welfare for survival . . .
If I am to survive, our domestic oil industry must survive . . .
Why does the federal government continue to aid, subsidize and enrich foreign countries hostile to our way of life with spoils from devastating our own small, elderly royalty owners and independent producers?65
Conclusion Every key indicator of the health of the domestic oil and gas industryearnings, employment, production, rig counts, rig rates and seismic activityis down.
If crude oil prices remain at continued low levels, there will likely be further contraction in the industry, a negative effect on economies of the states and nation due to a loss of tax revenues and jobs, further loss of skilled labor, and increasing imports of crude oil.
The recent collapse has put nearly all California oil producers under water, praying that the storm will pass before they Every key indicator of the have to take what may be their last breath.

would have to increase $2 per barrel (to $9.25) before 90 percent of the production would be economic.
With statistics like these, many producers and support service companies will not survive for long.
Like 1986, the damage will be permanent and evident for years to come.66 16
In addition, exploration for and production of natural gas is projected to be impacted as overall earnings reductions result in lower capital expenditures by industry.
This may affect domestic producers long-term ability to meet the nations demand for natural gas, a clean-burning and environmentally friendly fossil fuel with enormous future potential.
Jack Taylor, president, Hiawatha Exploration Company of Oklahoma City, has been in the oil business for 56 years and has experience throughout the country.
According to Taylor, smaller producers are seeing no way to hold on, as prices continue at historic low levels.
Ive been through three of these horrible oil downturns and this time is different, Taylor said.
Producers this time are saying whats the use and they are dying.
The nations producers feel everyone has gone off and left them.
