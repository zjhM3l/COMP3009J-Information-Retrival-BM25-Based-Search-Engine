CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION AND CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS In This Chapter Ã˜ Conceptual Foundation Ã˜ Central Hypothesis Ã˜ Habitat Types and Time-Space Scales Ã˜ Central Hypothesis by Habitat Type
The intellectual framework of the GEM Program is a hierarchy composed of a conceptual 2.1 Introduction to foundation, central hypothesis, habitat-specific the GEM hypotheses, research questions, and ultimately, Conceptual testable hypotheses based on the specific Foundation questions (Figure 2.1).
Four habitat-specific hypotheses, based on the central hypothesis, form the core of the GEM monitoring plan.
The conceptual foundation provides an overarching explanation, or verbal model, of how the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) ecosystems produce biological resources.
As such, the conceptual foundation is not itself a testable hypothesis on the sources of change in ecosystems, but rather, the origin of hypotheses, both general and testable.
Habitat-specific hypotheses are based on assumptions about how natural and anthropogenic factors influence ecosystem functioning within each of the habitat types, recognizing that different factors may be important in different habitats.
This chapter presents the narrative of the GEM conceptual foundation for the GOA, addresses cross-habitat connections and regional variability, and adapts the narrative of the conceptual foundation to describe the four habitat types used by GEM.
2.1.1 The GOA at a Glance The conceptual foundation for the GOA ecosystem explains how its plant animal populations are controlled through time.
A broad, interdisciplinary conceptual foundation serves as a flexible framework for determining the type of monitoring and research activities that will be undertaken in implementing the The conceptual focuses on how GEM Program.

Taking the watersheds and marine areas of the GOA together at a single glance, the importance of key geological features in shaping the natural physical and biological forces that control productivity is apparent (Figure 2.2).
Note that features illustrated in Figure 2.2 are printed in bold in the following text.
Natural forces are shaped by the surface topography of the Gulf.
Storm tracks moving across the North Pacific from west to east can drive Aleutian Low Pressure Systems (Aleutian Low) deep into the GOA until the encounter with boundary mountains causes the release of precipitation and airborne contaminants.
Freshwater runoff strengthens the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC) even as it brings airborne and terrestrial pollutants into the watersheds and food webs.
Natural forces that control biological productivity are also shaped by the submarine topography (bathymetry) of the continental shelf.
Deep waters upwell across the continental shelf break, subsequently being carried across the photic

boundary into areas of photosynthetic activity by the motion of surface currents, (Alaska Coastal Current, ACC; Alaska Current, AC), lunar forcing, the motion of the earth, and tidal mixing.
These deep waters carry old carbon and nutrients up into the food webs of the shelf and onshore areas.
Where the deep waters encounter islands, seamounts and sills, the resulting currents may deform the boundaries of the frontal zones of the ACC (mid-shelf front) and AC (shelfbreak front), creating eddies that entrain plankton and other plants and animals for long periods of time.
Natural physical forces control productivity by limiting the amount of food and availability of habitats.
During the winter especially, the Aleutian Low produces wind-driven transport of surface marine waters (Ekman transport), bringing water onshore.
Movement of water onshore creates downwelling that takes plankton and associated nutrients out of the photic zone.
On the other hand, the wind may act to hold the nutrients dissolved in water and held in detritus in the photic zone in some areas, because wind also produces turbulence that mixes the surface water.
Turbulent mixing causes nutrients to be retained in surface waters, and retention increases production of phytoplankton, the base of the food web in surface waters.
Production of zooplankton, secondary productivity, is the trophic connection (linkage) of phytoplankton to production of forage fish, which in turn links primary productivity to seabirds, large fish, marine mammals, and benthic and intertidal communities.
The biogeochemical cycle is an important collection of natural biological and physical processes controlling the productivities of both marine and terrestrial environments.
The mechanisms that move carbon from the surface to the deep waters, are known collectively as the carbon pump.
Atmospheric carbon moves into seawater as carbon dioxide to be incorporated by phytoplankton during photosynthesis.
Carbon also enters the sea as carbonates leached from the land by freshwater runoff, as plant debris, and as other biological input, such as immigrations of salmon (salmon fry) and other anadromous species.
Carbon moves to benthic communities and to deep water as detritus and emigrant animals (overwintering copepods and migrating fish such as myctophids).
Emigrant animals (adult salmon and other anadromous species) also move marine carbon (and phosphorous and nitrogen) into the watersheds.
As illustrated by the interactions of biological and physical components of the biogeochemical cycle, natural biological forces modify the effects of natural physical forces on birds, fish, and mammals.
Because of biological-physical interactions, natural physical forces that cause changes in primary productivity do not necessarily cause proportional changes in populations of birds, fish, mammals, and benthic animals.
For example, the effects of physical forces on the amount of food available from primary productivity are modified through other natural forces, such as predation and competition among individuals, collectively known as the trophic linkages.
Populations that respond strongly to physical forcing of primary productivity on approximately the same time scales are termed "strongly

GRAM
coupled," and those that exhibit variable responses are termed "weakly coupled" with respect to those physical variables.
Note that physical forcing changes not only the food available from primary productivity, but also the extent of habitats available for reproduction and feeding.
Human actions also serve to change the ways in which populations of plants and animals respond to the natural physical forces that affect the responses of reproduction, growth, and survival through limiting food and habitat.
Human actions such as water withdrawals, sewage discharge, and development of coastal communities change productivity by altering habitat availability and trophic linkages.
The economy of Alaska depends heavily on extraction of natural resources (primarily oil, fish, and shellfish followed by timber and minerals).
Fishing and other extractive uses (subsistence, sport, commercial) affect death rates through removals.
Other forms of human action are more subtle, but no less effective, controls on productivity.
In the Northern Gulf of Alaska, recreation and tourism, oil and gas development, logging, road building and urbanization, marine transportation and subsistence harvests are all activities that have the potential to affect fish and wildlife populations and habitat.
Recreation and tourism may alter growth and reproduction by disturbing rookeries and introducing pollutants.
Commercial marine transport may alter productivity by introducing pollutants (oil spills) and noxious exotic species as competitors and predators.
Currently, the human impact on Alaska's marine ecosystems is relatively small compared to impacts in most of the developed world.
Even here, however, natural resource managers have concerns about localized pollution, the potential impacts of some fisheries, extreme changes in some fish and wildlife populations, and the little known impacts of contaminants and global warming.
In summary, Figure 2.2 shows that the GOA and its watersheds are part of a larger oceanic ecosystem in which natural physical forces such as currents, upwelling, downwelling, precipitation and runoff, acting over large and small distances, play important roles in determining basic biological productivity.
Natural physical forces respond primarily to seasonal shifts in the weather, and in particular to long-term changes in the intensity and location of the Aleutian Low in winter.
Increased upwelling offshore appears to increase inputs of nutrients to surface waters, which increases productivity of plankton.
Increased winds appear to increase the transport of zooplankton shoreward toward and past the shelfbreak.
How often and how much offshore zooplankton sources contribute to coastal food webs depends on natural physical and biological forces such as predation, migration, currents and structure of the fronts, formation and stability of eddies, degree and extent of turbulence, and responses of plankton to short and long-term changes in temperature and salinity.
A wide range of human impacts interacts with natural biological and physical forces to change productivity and community structure in the GOA.
Approximately 71,000 full-time residents live within the area directly affected by the oil spill and two to three times that number use the area seasonally for work

and recreation.
The spill area population, combined with that of the nearby population centers of Anchorage and Wasilla, totals more than 60percent of the state's 627,000 permanent residents.
When the resident population is combined with the more than one million tourists who visit the state each year, it becomes clear that the natural resources of the GOA cannot be immune to the pressures associated with human uses and activities.
Human activities have the most direct and obvious impacts at those sites in watersheds and intertidal areas where human populations are high.
Nonetheless, some human activities affect populations of birds, fish, shellfish, and mammals far offshore, and also have impacts far from the sites of the actions.
In short, human activities and natural forces together act over global to local scales to drive and shape marine and terrestrial life in the GOA and its tributary watersheds.
Because of the tremendous uncertainty about sources of long-term changes, the conceptual foundation does not provide a specific model (testable hypothesis) for ecosystem change.
Rather, the GEM conceptual foundation is designed to be broad enough to serve as a tool to organize thinking and research over long time periods, to encompass ecosystem interconnections, and to link information from traditional knowledge and scientific disciplines.
It takes into account both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems and addresses the influence of climate and human activity in influencing biological productivity within these interconnected systems.
By using this broad, scientifically grounded conceptual foundation, the GEM Program will be able to adapt to changes in understanding ecosystem processes without having to sacrifice long-term research and monitoring goals (NRC 2002).
The GEM Program will, however, need to develop specific testable hypotheses, as derived from a general, or central hypothesis, in order to implement the monitoring and research program.
As a start on a central hypothesis, consider the one provided by the National Research Council (NRC 2002, p. 27), as follows, The Gulf of Alaska, its surrounding watersheds, and human populations are an interconnected set of ecosystems that must be studied and monitored as an integrated whole.
Within this interconnected set, at time scales of years to decades, climate and human impacts are the two most important driving forces in determining primary production and its transfer to upper trophic-level organisms of concern to humans.
The NRC summary identifies climate and human impacts as the two most important determinants of biological production, among the many forcing factors recognized as significant in the conceptual foundation.
Nonetheless, the biological communities that support the birds, fish and mammals are subject to a variety of biological and physical agents and factors of change, any one of which can at times play an important, and even dominant, role in controlling populations of birds, fish, shellfish and mammals.
A formal statement of the central hypothesis that starts with and considers the full suite of forcing factors is needed to allow research and monitoring to identify the most important forcing factors for species and habitats of the GEM region.

Identifying the forcing factors, human and natural, that drive biological production requires framing hypotheses and questions that point the way for a scientific monitoring and research program.
The central hypothesis formally states widely held beliefs about what drives changes in living marine-related resources in time and space:
2.2
The Central Hypothesis and Habitat Types
Natural forces and human activities working over global to local scales bring about short term and long lasting changes in the biological communities that support birds, fish, shellfish and mammals.
Natural forces and human activities bring about change by altering relationships among defining characteristics of habitats and ecosystems such as heat and salt distribution, insolation, biological energy flow, freshwater flow, biogeochemical cycles, food web structure, fishery impacts, and pollutant levels.
Although widely accepted as fact, the specific mechanisms that cause change are largely untested in the GEM region, and the relative importance of the forcing factors is unknown.
Current speculations, supported by limited observations, are that forcing by winds, precipitation, predation, currents, natural competitors for food and habitat, fisheries, and pollutants change living marine-related resources over different scales of time and space through alteration of critical properties of habitats and ecosystems (Figures 2.3 and 2.4).

Although the central hypothesis may appear to be a bland statement of the obvious, it is an essential first step in applying the scientific method to address the many open, and sometimes highly contentious, scientific questions about whether,

and to what extent, human activities are responsible for degradation of habitats and declines in populations of animals.
The central hypothesis states what is thought to be known in general, preparing the way for questions that test the validity of this knowledge.
For example it is reasonable to ask of the central hypothesis, "What are the natural forces and are they equally important in all types of habitat?" Critically examining the starting point through posing and answering questions, is intended to point out the need for more specific hypotheses, which in turn lead to more specific questions, and so forth.

The central hypothesis is given more specificity through adaptation to habitat types in the following section.
Before adding specificity to the central hypothesis, the habitat types need definition, and the context of conducting studies at timespace scales appropriate to the phenomenon needs to be provided.
To better organize the GEM Program, four habitat types, representative of the GEM region, have been identified as themes around which the interdisciplinary monitoring and research activities that address GEM's central hypothesis will be organized.
These habitat types are: watersheds, the intertidal and subtidal areas, the ACC, and the offshore areas (the continental shelf break and the Alaska Gyre).
These habitats were selected after evaluating information about how natural forces and human activities control biological productivity in the northern GOA (Chapters 6 and 7).
The habitats are composed of identifiable, although not rigid, collections of characteristic microhabitats, resident and migratory species, and physical features.
The physical locations are described below: Â§ Watersheds--freshwater and terrestrial habitats from the mountains to the extent of a river's plume.

Â§ Â§ Â§
Intertidal and subtidal areas--brackish and salt-water coastal habitats that extend offshore to the 20-m depth contour.
ACC--a swift coastal current of lower salinities (25 to 31 psu) typically found within 35 km of the shore.
Offshore--the continental shelf break (between the 200-m and 1,000-m depth contours) and the Alaska Gyre in waters outside the 1,000-m depth contour.
The decision to use habitats as a mechanism for stratifying funding and allocating resources will require the GEM Program to ensure that cross-habitat processes and transfers are not forgotten or ignored.
Having an appreciation for the scales of time and space over which the processes responsible for biological production occur is essential for designing monitoring and research intended to detect and understand changes in the ecosystem (Figure 2.5).
To understand the composition and extent of ecosystems, it is necessary to ask and answer questions about the distances and time associated with the variation in the biological and physical phenomena.
As stated eloquently by Ricklefs (1990, p. 169), "Every phenomenon, regardless of its scale in space and time, includes finer scale processes and patterns and is embedded in a matrix of processes and patterns having larger dimensions."
Indeed, spatial and temporal scales are part of the definitions of physical and biological processes such as advection and growth.

Taking account of spatial and temporal scales is critical to studying linkages between natural forces and biological responses (Francis et al. 1998).
Cross-habitat linkages and processes will be incorporated into the GEM Program in several ways that will be described in more detail in later chapters.
The primary mechanisms for ensuring they are addressed will be through ongoing synthesis of research results and oversight by the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee.
It is also expected that modeling efforts will be regional in focus rather than habitat specific.
2.2.1 Central Hypothesis by Habitat Type The central hypothesis is adapted to each habitat type: Watersheds: Natural forces (such as climate) and human activities (such as habitat degradation and fishing) serve as distant and local factors in causing short-term and long-lasting changes in marine-related biological production in watersheds.
Intertidal and Subtidal: Natural forces (such as currents and predation) and human activities (such as increased urbanization and localized pollution) serve as distant and local factors, in causing short-term and longlasting changes in community structure and dynamics of the intertidal and subtidal habitats.
Alaska Coastal Current (ACC): Natural forces (such as variability in the strength, structure and dynamics of the ACC) and human activities (such as fishing and pollution) cause local and distant changes in production of phytoplankton, zooplankton, birds, fish, and mammals.
Offshore: Natural forces (such as changes in the strength of the Alaska Current and Alaskan Stream, mixed layer depth of the gyre, wind stress and downwelling) and human activities (such as pollution) play significant roles in determining production of carbon and its shoreward transport.
As noted above, these hypotheses can be used as a general guide to monitoring and research, but they need to be further refined into questions which identify a core set of measurements for implementation of long-term monitoring and research.
In Chapter 4 the habitat-type hypotheses are examined through specific questions that lead to preliminary recommendations on what information needs to be gathered, as a starting point for the GEM Program.

for implementing the program, as provided in Chapter 3, are needed before launching into the details of implementation found in Chapter 4.
Before moving on to the definition of implementation tools, it should be noted that information for developing these specific questions into a monitoring and research program comes from many sources, including analysis of ongoing and existing research results, evaluation of agency monitoring programs and activities, and input from a variety of interest groups including scientists, resource managers and the communities.
Over the long-term one of the most valuable resources for identifying research questions may be the legacy of scientific information and results from community involvement projects from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Program.
The following chapter describes the process by which gap analysis, synthesis, and research are used to implement the GEM Program and guide selection of variables for long-term monitoring.
Chapter 4 introduces potential research questions that may be used to begin development of the GEM Science Plan
