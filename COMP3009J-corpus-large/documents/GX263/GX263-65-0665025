EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Department of Regulatory Agencies has concluded its Sunset Review of State Board of Pharmacy.
After independent research, interviews with Board members, the regulated community, and other interested parties, DORA recommends continuing the regulatory authority of the Board.
The report makes several specific recommendations, both statutory and administrative, to modify the program if it is continued.
Abuse of prescription drugs is prevalent in Colorado and nation wide.
Reporting the distribution of controlled substances at the consumer level is a weak link in drug abuse enforcement.
A key recommendation of the report is a centralized reporting system for controlled substances by prescription drug outlets.
The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP), has developed a national Model Pharmacy Act (MPA).
NABP is recommending member states adopt the MPA to develop consistency between state programs.
Several of the recommendations in the report were based on language and recommendations from the MPA.
The MPA contains provisions giving licensed pharmacists limited prescriptive authority.
A complete analysis of this provision is beyond the scope of this report.
However, no evidence was presented which indicated a risk to the public by continuing the current restrictions on pharmacists releasing drugs by prescription order only.
Therefore, the report does not include a recommendation for prescriptive authority.
It is expected that members of the profession will discuss the issue in detail during the Sunset Hearing.
Executive Summary Page 2 Another provision in the MPA, endorsed by the Board, is the ability to levy civil fines on practitioners as a disciplinary option.
Some occupational boards in Colorado, such as Accountancy, Outfitters, Veterinary, and the Gaming Commission, have the ability to use fines as a disciplinary option.
Use of fines is appropriate when the damage caused is economic.
In health care professions, the primary concern is physical harm, not economic.
For this reason, the report does not recommend fines as a disciplinary option.
Chapter 1 Page 3
BACKGROUND The State Board of Pharmacy, in the Division of Registrations, Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) shall be terminated July 1, 1996 unless continued by the general assembly.
During the year prior to this date it is the responsibility of DORA to conduct an analysis of the program in compliance with Â§ 24-34-104, C.R.S.
The purpose of this review is to determine whether the State Board of Pharmacy should be continued for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
The report also evaluates the performance of the Division of Registrations in relation to this program.
During this review, the Division must demonstrate that there is still a need for the program and that the regulation is the least restrictive regulatory structure consistent with the public interest.
DORA's findings and recommendations are submitted to the Sunrise and Sunset Review Committee of the Colorado General Assembly.
Statutory criteria used in the sunset review is found in the appendix of this report.
The Sunset Review process includes an analysis of the statute, interviews with state authorities, Board of Pharmacy members, professional and trade association representatives, and regulated individuals.
Every effort is made to elicit information and comments from all interested parties.
Chapter 2 Page 4
SUMMARY OF STATUTE The Colorado Pharmacy Act is contained in Â§ 12-22-101 et seq., C.R.S.
The Act defines the scope of the practice of pharmacy, creates the State Pharmacy Board (Board), and establishes the framework for the promulgation of regulations by the Board.
The Board consists of five licensed pharmacists and two public members, all appointed by the governor.
The Act specifies geographical diversity, by congressional district.
The Board is required to meet at least three times per year and elect its own officers.
Section 108 of the Act gives the Board broad authority to promulgate regulations necessary for the administration of the Act.
Definitions are contained in Â§ 102 of the Act.
The Act defines prescription drug outlet (PDO) as "any outlet where prescriptions are filled or compounded, and are sold, dispensed, offered, or displayed for sale."
Outlet is defined as "... any prescription drug outlet, hospital, institution, nursing home, rural health clinic, convalescent home, extended care facility, family planning clinic, wholesaler, manufacturer, mail order vendor, other than a pharmacist, with facilities in this state who engages in the dispensing, delivery, distribution, manufacturing, wholesaling, or sale of drugs or devices."
Section 110 contains the powers and duties of the Board which includes: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Inspection of pharmacies and investigation of violations of the Act or regulations promulgated under the Act; Administration of examination for licensure; The ability to apply to the courts for restraining orders and injunctions to enjoin violations of the Act; The power to grant licenses and renewals; The power to deny, revoke or suspend licenses, for cause; and
Chapter 2 - Summary of Statute Page 5 Â· The ability to impound and destroy adulterated or misbranded drugs and devices at a prescription drug outlet.
All pharmacists are required to fulfill a Board approved internship prior to licensure in Colorado.
The internship must be supervised and evaluated by a Board approved licensed pharmacist (preceptor).
The Board has regulatory authority over the requirements for internship, including the areas of study, evaluation and preceptor approval.
Guidelines for the Board are contained in Â§ 12-22-111, C.R.S.
The Board is responsible for the control and regulation of drugs under Â§ 12-22-112, C.R.S.
This includes the regulation of retail sales, purity and quality of drugs, the procedures, equipment, environment and supplies necessary to compound or dispense drugs, and the control of the sale of medical devices requiring a prescription.
Insurance companies licensed to sell malpractice insurance to pharmacists in Colorado must report malpractice claims to the Board.
The Board may consider information provided by the insurance company malpractice settlement in disciplinary hearings and may review such information in closed session as provided for in Â§ 12-22-113.5, C.R.S.
The regulation of pharmacists and PDOs is a cash funded program.
Fees are established and collected in accordance with Â§ 24-34-105, C.R.S.
Fees for the licensing of pharmacists, interns, PDOs, pharmacy managers, changing pharmacy names or managers, and issuing duplicate licenses for any licensee are authorized by Â§ 12-22-114(1), C.R.S.
Any pharmacist licensed by the state for fifty years or more is exempt from the payment of fees for continued licensure.
Chapter 2 - Summary of Statute Page 6 Under Â§ 12-22-115, C.R.S., The Board has the ability to use the resources of any recognized accrediting organization in determining the approval of a school or college of pharmacy for meeting the educational requirements for licensure in Colorado.
The Board must maintain a list of approved schools of pharmacy from which graduation is necessary to obtain a license to practice pharmacy in Colorado.
The Act, in Â§Â§ 12-22-116 - 118, C.R.S., outlines the application procedures for licensure as an intern, pharmacist, outlets, manufacturer, or wholesaler.
The Act identifies four classes of pharmacist licenses and provides an exemption from licensure for hospital residency programs.
Applicants for professional licensure must pass a Board approved written examination.
Graduates from foreign pharmacy schools may be required to demonstrate proficiency in the English language.
The Board is required to issue a license by endorsement to a licensee from another jurisdiction with substantially similar licensing requirements, provided the licensee's disciplinary record is satisfactory.
All PDOs must register with the Board and must be managed by a licensed pharmacist.
A pharmacist may manage only one PDO.
The pharmacy owner must notify the Board of management or ownership changes.
PDOs owned by political subdivisions of the state are exempt from the registration provisions of Â§12-22-119, C.R.S.; however, they must obtain a certificate of compliance from the Board.
Section 119 also allows a licensed pharmacist to delegate certain pharmacist functions (such as the compounding, dispensing, labeling, delivery, storage, and distribution of drugs and devices and the maintenance of proper records) to a non licensed person under the licensed pharmacist's direct and immediate supervision.
Certain outlets recognized in section 120 are exempt from the provisions for the management by a pharmacist by Â§ 12-22-119(3)(b), C.R.S.
Such outlets must have written protocols for the dispensing of drugs, prepared by a consulting pharmacists and approved by the Board.
The Board has regulations on the frequency of protocol review, and regulates the supervision of these outlets by licensed pharmacists.
Chapter 2 - Summary of Statute Page 7 Section 120 provides the Board with the authority to register various types of drug outlets, including manufacturing facilities.
The section requires the Board to accept nursing, residential and intermediate care facility licenses issued by the Health Facilities Division of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, as registration.
Non prescription drugs are exempted from the Pharmacy Act in this section.
Section 120(1)(e) identifies an "other" category of PDOs.
These are usually community health clinics, jails or prisons, planned parenthood clinics, and animal shelters.
These outlets may dispense prescription drugs under approved protocols without the immediate and direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist.
Section 121 contains provisions that govern the compounding, dispensing and sale of prescription drugs and devices.
Dispensing provisions exempt authorized emergency room personnel and licensed practitioners from regulation by the Board when dispensing to patients.
Section 12-22-121(14), C.R.S., requires the Board to promulgate regulations quantifying the number of non-licensed persons a pharmacist may supervise when the pharmacist and non-licensed person are engaged in dispensing.
Pharmacies are authorized to provide emergency medical kits to specifically identified licensed health care facilities.
All licensed pharmacists are authorized by Section 122 to issue medications without a valid prescription under very limited circumstance.
These situations are limited to providing small amounts of medication under previously authorized prescriptions when the prescriber cannot be contacted and, in the professional judgment of the pharmacist, the medication is necessary for the patient.
Section 123 contains labeling requirements for medications dispensed pursuant to a prescription order.
Section 124 allows pharmacist to recommend and substitute generic drugs for the prescribed medication with the patient's permission, unless specifically prohibited by the prescriber.
Chapter 2 - Summary of Statute Page 8 Disciplinary authority for the Board is contained in Section 125.
This includes the ability to suspend, deny, revoke or place limitations on a license or registration issued by the Board.
Licensees or registrants are afforded a hearing in accordance with the State Administrative Procedure Act before disciplinary actions take effect.
The Board may issue a formal "Letter of Admonition" in situations where violations are determined to be insufficient to warrant more severe action.
Disciplinary actions are subject to judicial review under Â§ 12-22-125.5, C.R.S.
Sections 126 and 127 prohibit certain acts, such as obtaining or dispensing drugs by fraud, deceit, or subterfuge.
First offenses of the Act are considered class 2 misdemeanors.
Second and subsequent offenses are classified as class 6 felonies.
Under Â§ 128, new drugs are prohibited from sale or distribution, until approved by federal law for interstate sale.
Exceptions are provided for research by persons qualified to conduct safety and effectiveness tests.
Prescription drug outlets may advertise prescription drug prices.
Section 129 requires advertisements of drugs by brand or proprietary name to include the generic drug name.
Part Two of the Act regulated the working hours of licensed pharmacists.
This part two was repealed in 1981.
Part Three of the Act is also known as the "Colorado Controlled Substances Act".
Part Three authorizes the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) to regulate substance abuse programs and provides for the licensing of persons manufacturing, transporting, possessing, or transferring a drug precursor by CDPHE.
The licensing of drug precursors is the subject of a separate sunset report by DORA.
Part Five of the Act concerned the control of drug paraphernalia.
This part was repealed in 1992.
Part Six of the Act contains provisions for the Pharmacy Peer Health Assistance Diversion Program.
Part Six was established in 1991 and amended extensively in 1993.
Chapter 2 - Summary of Statute Page 9 Regulation Review The regulations promulgated by the Board are contained in the Colorado Code of Regulations (CCR) 3 CCR 719-1 (1993).
The regulations were last modified in June of 1992, effective July 30, 1992.
The Board has rules establishing a professional code of conduct.
Included in this code of conduct are requirements forbidding the practice of pharmacy while employed by a person authorized to prescribe drugs, or to participate in any plan which detrimentally affects a patient.
The code requires pharmacists to advise patients on the proper use and affects of a prescription when requested, or when in the pharmacist's judgment it is in the best interest of the patient.
The code outlines a standard of confidentiality regarding patient information.
The next sections of the regulations concern prescription orders and dispensing of prescription drugs or devices.
Regulations specify who may issue and receive orders, the format in which orders must be received, procedures to follow when prescriptions are transferred between pharmacies, recordkeeping requirements for controlled substances, and labeling requirements for dispensed prescriptions.
The Board has regulations for the licensing and evaluation of pharmacy interns, and the approval of intern preceptors (supervisors).
The Board licenses four classes of pharmacists.
A Class I licensee is a person licensed in Colorado prior to July 2, 1979; Class IV licenses are granted to applicants applying for licensure by examination in Colorado (licensure by examination includes a Board administered jurisprudence examination); Class V is a license granted by endorsement; and a Class VI license is issued to a graduate of a foreign school of pharmacy who meets the licensing requirements in Colorado (including a Board approved English proficiency examination).
Chapter 2 - Summary of Statute Page 10 Board regulations concerning prescription drug outlets are extensive.
The regulations require registration of all outlets, notification and approval of changes in ownership or management, and controlled substance inventories in the event of ownership or management changes.
The Board has procedures for the closing of a pharmacy to ensure patients are notified and that their records are available for transfer to another pharmacy.
The regulations detail, in section 5.01.41 through 5.01.65, physical requirements for a prescription drug outlet.
Because of the importance of the compounding area, where ingredients are mixed, weighed, or otherwise prepared, emphasis is placed on stringent standards in this area.
Regulations specify the size of the counter top in the drug compounding area, required equipment, ventilation, the availability of a reference library, requirements for compounding sterile parnteral products and security requirements.
Regardless of who owns the building or business where the outlet is operated, the pharmacist has control and responsibility for the drug compounding area.
The Board must approve written protocols for compounding, dispensing and recordkeeping by outlets, prior to registration approval.
Non-pharmacy outlets, such as community clinics, jails, schools, and county health departments, must have approved protocols provided by a consulting pharmacist.
The consulting pharmacist must periodically visit the facility, specified by a schedule in the regulations, to ensure compliance with protocols and applicable laws.
Chapter 2 - Summary of Statute Page 11 The Board regulates the contents and access to emergency medical kits provided to health care facilities specified in the Act.
Kits contain small amounts of prescription drugs.
These are generally a 12-72 hour supply of the drugs, such as nitroglycerin tablets, antinfectives, analgesics and tranquilizers, commonly in an emergency.
Kits must be registered with the Board and the pharmacy supplying the kit maintains ownership and responsibility for the drugs contained in the kit.
Pharmacies must maintain separate records for each kit and inspect them at least annually.
Facilities opening a kit must notify the pharmacy within 72 hours and provide a written prescription for any of the contents removed.
Section 11 of the Pharmacy Regulations contain the requirements for the use of computers or automated data processing systems in the practice of pharmacy.
New and refill prescription order transactions must be entered into the system at the time of the transaction.
Daily printouts of prescription drug transactions must be maintained and available for inspection by Board representatives.
Board regulations include detailed requirements on the information that must be included in the daily printouts.
Transactions involving controlled substances must be specifically identified.
Nuclear pharmacies deal with the preparation and delivery of radioactive material used in medical procedures.
They have special requirements to comply with, contained in section 12 of the regulations.
In addition to the requirements for licensure as a pharmacist, nuclear pharmacists must complete a minimum of 200 hours of instruction in radiopharmaceutical service from an approved program.
The Board has developed special record keeping requirements with which nuclear pharmacies must comply.
These are in addition to those which are standard for prescription drug outlets.
Nuclear pharmacies must also comply with regulations of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment regarding radiation control.
Chapter 2 - Summary of Statute Page 12 The Board has established procedures for any individual to petition the Board for a declaratory order to clarify the applicability of any statutory or regulatory provision enforced by the Board.
This is commonly used by persons establishing new procedures in a pharmacy who want to make sure they are in compliance with Board regulations.
The procedures for requesting a declaratory order are detailed in section 13 of the regulations.
Section 14 of the regulations is devoted to recordkeeping requirements for outlets.
Inventory records must be kept a minimum of two years.
The regulations specify which records must be maintained on site and which must be made available upon request by the Board or its representative.
The recordkeeping requirements are more stringent for controlled substances.
They incorporate by reference sections of the federal code of regulations applying to controlled substances.
The Board has specific regulatory requirements for drug wholesalers and drug manufacturing facilities.
These are contained in sections 15 and 16 of the regulations.
Recordkeeping and security issues are a high priority, in order to prevent the unlawful distribution of controlled substances.
The final section of the Board regulations deal with the use of electronic transfer orders (ETO), including facsimile (fax) machines for transmitting prescriptions.
The regulations cover the receipt of both original and transfer prescriptions.
The dispensing of controlled substances via an ETO prescription is prohibited.
Chapter 3 Page 13
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ADMINISTRATION of five licensed pharmacists with at least five years of experience in the state of Colorado and two public members.
All are appointed by the governor.
No Board member may serve more than two consecutive four year terms.
At least one member must reside in each congressional district and no more than four members shall belong to the same political party.
The Board elects its own officers from the appointed members.
The Board is required by Â§ 12-22-107, C.R.S. to meet at least three times per year; however, in practice, it meets more frequently.
The investigations, inspections and administrative functions of the Board are performed by classified state employees of the Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Registrations.
Oversight of the administrative staff is provided by a Program Administrator.
This Program Administrator also supervises the staff of the Veterinarian and Optometric Boards.
The Program Administrator oversees three full-time licensed pharmacists to conduct inspections and investigate complaints.
DORA also employs 2.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) clerical support staff to process license and registration applications, renewal applications, and to provide administrative support to the Board.
The regulatory program for pharmacists is cash funded by the licensing and registration fees of the regulated individuals and businesses.
Colorado currently has 740 registered pharmacies and 4,900 licensed pharmacists.
The Board has also issued licenses to 50 wholesalers and 5 manufactures.
There are approximately 1,400 other special licenses or registrations issued by the Board each year for interns, preceptors, limited licenses (animal shelters), or other outlets (prisons, community health clinics).
The fees for licensing and registration are adjusted each year based on the prior years expenses in relation to the number of licensees.
The relatively large number of licensees provides a sufficient base to absorb expenses without extreme variations in fees.
The licensing fee has remained less than $200 per two year cycle for the past several years (see Table 1 for a partial list of related fees).
The Board of Pharmacy consists

biannually.
The regulation of prescription drugs is a shared responsibility of the federal and state governments.
The federal government, through the "Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act", Food and Drug Administration, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the "Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act" has extensive authority to control various chemical compounds that have therapeutic benefits.
Chapter 3 - Program Description and Administration Page 15 While the federal government has extensive control and recordkeeping requirements over what may be dispensed, individual states have broad latitude over who may administer, dispense and prescribe controlled substances.
In Colorado, as in most states, prescription drug control is divided along two lines.
The first is those who may prescribe controlled substances.
Traditionally, this has been limited to licensed medical professionals, physicians, dentists and veterinarians, although recent trends have expanded prescriptive authority.
The second, dispensing has with few exceptions, been the exclusive domain of pharmacists.
Colorado has been licensing pharmacists since the State Board of Pharmacy was created as an independent licensing authority in 1887.
Original licensing requirements were (1) graduation from a school of pharmacy and two years of experience or (2) two years of experience and a passing score on a Board administered examination.
The authority of the Board, and regulatory requirements for pharmacists, has changed several times in the 108 years since its creation.
The makeup of the Board has been changed from only licensed pharmacists selected by the Pharmacy Association to a mixture of public and professional members appointed by the governor.
In 1968, administration of the Board was transferred to the DORA, Division of Registrations by a Type 1 transfer under the Administrative Organization Act.
It was not until 1979 that persons without a degree in pharmacy were excluded from obtaining a pharmacist license.
Chapter 4 Page 16
SUNSET ANALYSIS The Board has a satisfactory mix of public and professional members.
In making recommendations for appointments for new members, professional organizations recognize the need to diversify the professional members by areas of specialization, i.e. retail pharmacist, nuclear pharmacist, hospital pharmacist.
The requirement that at least one person on the Board must be from each congressional district sometimes limits the pool of candidates making it difficult to achieve the desired practice representation.
The original intent of the regulation of pharmacists was to ensure minimum qualifications of those compounding prescription drugs.
However, national and state regulatory requirements are now focused on two main objectives.
The first, is to ensure the public receives the quality and strength of medications prescribed by medical practitioners.
The public has an expectation that when a medical professional prescribes drug therapy to resolve a medical condition that the course of treatment is correct.
They also expect that when they receive a prescription from a licensed pharmacist, it is the correct drug and the proper dosage.
Not receiving the correct drug, or dosage, may have serious consequences for the patient.
Under utilization of drug therapy may result in prolonging the illness or only masking a serious condition.
Overdoses of controlled substances may lead to severe injuries or even death.
Even an overdose of antibiotics may cause liver or kidney damage, or send the patient into toxic shock.
While the Board investigates several complaints each year of mislabeled prescriptions, the number, in relation to the number of prescriptions issued, is insignificant.
The second objective is to reduce the abuse of drugs by limiting access to controlled substances.
In this area, regulatory efforts have been less than successful.
According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), 15 of the top 20 abused drugs, and over 30% of all illegally sold drugs are prescription drugs (see Table 2).
Prescription drug abuse is the cause of more injuries and deaths than all other illegal drugs combined, according to the Colorado Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force.

Methadone Information obtained from the Colorado Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force indicates that while Colorado has made improvements in reducing prescription drug abuse, it is still a problem (see Table 3).
Table 4 below tracks the reduction in Colorado's ranking in abuse of some of the most commonly abused prescription drugs.
Colorado ranked in the top ten states in per capita consumption of five of the abused prescription drugs.
By 1989, Colorado no longer ranked in the top ten in per capita consumption of any of the most abused prescription drugs.

Source: Colorado Drug/Alcohol Coordinated Data System Schedule II drugs are those which are most likely to be abused and therefore have the strictest controls.
The tracking of these drugs is very complex and is the shared responsibility of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers.
Each time controlled substances are transferred between one of these entities, DEA order forms are generated and sent to the DEA.
Pharmacy inspectors routinely review controlled substance records and verify DEA order form information when conducting pharmacy inspections.
This system is labor intensive and mostly manually operated.
Information concerning potential abuse of controlled substances is frequently exchanged between DEA, Pharmacy Inspectors, and other appropriate licensing boards in DORA.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 19 Pharmacies and other outlets registered by the Board conduct regular "self inspections", essentially self audit reporting, using inspection forms sent by, and returned to, the Board.
Prior to 1993, inspectors conducted complete inspections of all PDO every eight months and also periodically "visited" PDO.
Personnel reductions, combined with increased numbers of licensees, has reduced the number and frequency of complete inspections.
Current Board regulations to implement Â§ 12-22-121(14), C.R.S., have established a one to one ratio for unlicensed persons supervised by a pharmacist engaged in dispensing.
Some individuals contacted for this report indicated a belief that this is an overly conservative ratio in some settings.
Variations in the skill and experience levels of both the nonlicensed personnel and the pharmacist may justify a higher ratio in some instances.
However, the Act specifies a uniform standard for all pharmacists.
The General Assembly may want to consider giving the Board some flexibility in this area.
The Act specifically identifies "nuclear pharmacy" as a specialized prescription drug outlet.
This is the only specialized outlet identified in the Act.
The practice of pharmacy has changed over the years giving rise to a variety of specializations within the profession, such as consultant pharmacist, intravenous pharmacist, collaborative practice, hospital pharmacy, and others.
Some states, such as Texas and California, have recognized this trend and have by statute, authorized regulatory authorities to establish specialized licenses under their pharmacy acts.
The current definition of PDO does not address a large hospital complex that may have several dispensing points under a single pharmacy license.
There are a variety of options to address this situation.
The Board could require a separate license for each dispensing point.
This would be unnecessarily burdensome on the complex.
The Board has proposed, in the MPA, defining separate distribution points as satellites of the licensed PDO.
This appears to be the most reasonable alternative reviewed.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 20 The American Council on Pharmaceutical Education is the accrediting organization that sets standards for pharmacy schools and the standards for continuing pharmaceutical education.
The University of Colorado, Health Sciences Center operates the only accredited pharmacy school in Colorado.
The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) is the nationally recognized entity for setting standards for testing and licensing pharmacists.
The NABP administers the national examination for pharmacists.
California is the only state not using the NABP examination for licensure by examination.
NABP also operates a national clearing house for disciplinary actions and licensing transfers.
Colorado is one of only four states not requiring use of the NABP clearing house for licensing transfers.
This saves applicants transferring to Colorado the $250 fee charged by NABP for processing the paperwork.
However, it increases the administrative burden to the Board.
Individuals applying directly to the Board for licensure by endorsement are not subject to a NABP search of disciplinary actions in other states.
The applicant is required to sign a statement to the effect that all information concerning other state licensing and disciplinary actions is complete and accurate.
False or incomplete information on the application is grounds for license revocation, however, it is unlikely such information would come to the attention of the Board.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 21 The Board issues licenses to new applicants by three methods: examination, endorsement through the Board, and endorsement through a clearing house.
Individuals requesting licensure by examination submit a complete application to the Board for evaluation.
Application materials documenting minimum requirements for licensure, include information about education, internship, and employment history must be submitted to the Board.
The applicants must pass a Board administered written jurisprudence examination in addition to the national examination.
Currently, the Board uses the NABP examination as the approved national examination.
Test scores are submitted directly to the Board by NABP.
Once application information is verified the Board and satisfactory examination scores are confirmed by NABP, the license is issued.
The Board then approves the license at its next regular meeting Pharmacists licensed and in good standing in another state(s) who wish to become licensed in Colorado may apply to the Board for licensure by endorsement.
In this situation, the applicant submits an application containing information about education, current state licensing status and disciplinary actions directly to the Board.
The Board, then verifies the information with current state(s) of license.
Since most states use the NABP clearinghouse, they are either not equipped to, or are reluctant to provide information on licensees to other states except through the clearing house.
Pharmacists applying for licensure by endorsement generally obtain a license as soon as qualifications and current license status is verified.
Because of the difficulty in verifying information from other states, this sometimes takes 4-6 weeks from the time the completed application is received by the Board.
The license is ratified at the next regular meeting of the Board following verification of information.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 22 The third method for obtaining a license is by endorsement through an approved clearing house.
Currently, the Board uses the NABP clearing house.
According to NABP, 78% of the applicants using the NABP Transfer of Pharmacist License Clearinghouse Program result in completed, verified information transmitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities in five weeks or less.
The majority of those applications taking longer than five weeks are applicants licensed in multiple states, resulting in extended time to research disciplinary actions in several states.
Colorado relies on individual applicants not using the clearing house to self report multiple state licenses.
Based upon which method was used to obtain a license, and when the license was obtained, an applicant is granted one of four classes of pharmacy license.
As previously stated, a Class I licensee is a person licensed in Colorado prior to July 2, 1979; Class IV licenses are granted to applicants applying for licensure by examination in Colorado; Class V is a license granted by endorsement, and a Class VI license is issued to a graduate of a foreign school of pharmacy who meets the licensing requirements in Colorado.
There are no practice limitations placed on a pharmacist based upon the class of license issued.
Applicants applying for licensure by endorsement are exempted from taking the Colorado jurisprudence examination.
All licenses and registrations issued by the Board expire in accordance with the provisions of Â§ 24-34-102(8), C.R.S.
This allows the Director of the Division of Registrations to stagger expiration dates to smooth out the administrative work involved in processing renewals.
Licensees must submit a renewal fee on or before the expiration date of the license to maintain licensure.
Licensees missing the renewal date may apply for reinstatement for the remainder of the renewal period.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 23 The Act does not require an evaluation of competency, continuing education or a demonstration of actual practice to renew a license.
The Board does require a passing score on an out of practice examination and jurisprudence examination for licensees applying for reinstatement, if they can not document at least 400 hours in the practice of pharmacy during the year prior to the application for reinstatement.
Some representatives of the pharmacy community have indicated a desire for Mandatory Continuing Education (MCE) to maintain licensure.
The report does not endorse MCE for licensed pharmacists.
The Board administers the jurisprudence examination four times per year.
Two of the examinations are linked with the NABP examinations to allow applicants to complete both examination requirements at one time.
In the 1985 Pharmacy Sunset Report, DORA recommended the Board use an open book, mail in jurisprudence examination to reduce the burden on out of state applicants.
The General Assembly instead eliminated the examination requirement for licensure by endorsement, under the assumption that licensees in another state passed that states jurisprudence examination.
There is no statistical information available on the relationship between successful completion of the jurisprudence examination and competency in the practice of pharmacy.
The Board has the authority, under Â§ 12-22-125, C.R.S. to deny, suspend, or revoke any license or registration issued under the Act.
The Board may also issue a Letter of Admonition when an investigation discloses an instance of misconduct that does not warrant more severe action by the Board.
The Board occasionally issues confidential Letters of Concern when investigations reveal no violations, but practice conditions exist where violations could potentially occur.
Since the Board has no statutory authority for Letters of Concern, they cannot be considered a formal disciplinary action.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 24 Violations of Board regulations are discovered through a variety of channels; self reporting, inspections, consumer complaints, professional complaints, other agency referrals, and malpractice insurance reports.
Table 5 details investigatory actions for the past three years.
Malpractice insurance claims in this fiscal year have increased dramatically.
This is due to new Board regulations requiring self insured pharmacies to report claims.
Because the statute only requires licensed insurance companies to report, there is concern that the Board lacks the ability to enforce the regulation on self insured pharmacies.
TABLE 5 Investigations Investigations initiated by Board or via Complaint Investigations initiated via insurance settlements Dismissed, no violation found Letter of admonition issued Referred to Attorney General (AG) Stipulated settlement through AG License denied Licensed suspended or revoked 1992 68 14 33 20 23 22 0 0 1993 75 11 16 30 22 17 2 2 1994 64 12 26 21 12 3 0 2
A review of complaint investigations by the Board revealed some inconsistencies in the disciplinary actions for similar offenses.
Some of this may be attributed to a concern of the Board on the welfare of the public served in rural areas.
Suspending the license of the only pharmacist in a small town may result in patients being forced to travel long distances to obtain medications.
The Board avoids this action unless the continued operation of the pharmacy clearly endangers the public.
However, actions based on this concern create inequities among licensees.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 25 A major issue has been raised in regard to the enforcement and disciplinary responsibilities of the Board.
The Board has used the provisions of Â§ 12-22-110(2), C.R.S., "such other duties, power, and authority as may be necessary to the enforcement..." as implied investigative subpoena powers.
The Board has not been challenged on this issue, but the possibility exists.
Other professional licensing boards have specific subpoena powers contained in their statutory authority.
Other issues related to enforcement powers of the Board were: (1) the inability to discipline out of state pharmacists, (mail order firms); (2) the ability to issue punitive fines as a disciplinary option; (3) expansion of Board authority to seize or embargo drugs at non outlet locations, and (4) creation of a mechanism to collect legal expenses from those disciplined licensees.
Each of these concerns were evaluated, but the report is not making recommendations to change the current status of Board authority in these areas.
The Act, in Â§ 12-22-119, C.R.S., requires prescription drug outlets to register with the Board, and obtain Board approval before commencing operation.
The Act exempts prescription drug outlets operated by government entities from registration but requires them to obtain a certificate of compliance from the Board.
Holders of a certificate of compliance must comply with all regulatory requirements of the Board, but are exempted from paying registration fees.
The terms license and registration are used inconsistently throughout the Act.
The Act gives the Board authority to license pharmacists, then refers to licensed pharmacists as "Registered Pharmacists" such as in 12-22-110 (1)(a) C.R.S.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 26 Section 10 of the Board regulations implement Â§ 12-22121(13), C.R.S., regarding the placement of emergency kits in licensed Nursing, Intermediate Health and Residential Care Facilities.
As health care has evolved over the years, new types of health care facilities have been identified and regulated by the Health Facilities Division of the CDPHE.
The identification of three specific licensed facilities in the Act limits the placement of emergency drugs in other recognized facilities, such as hospices.
The General Assembly should consider authorizing the Board determine which facilities are appropriate for the placement of an emergency kit.
Recent trends in health care have expanded the prescriptive authority of some health care professionals.
The Colorado General Assembly recently granted prescriptive authority to advance practice nurses, operating under a collaborative agreement with a licensed physician.
Several states have enacted legislation extending prescriptive authority to pharmacists.
The State of Washington has what is considered to be one of the most innovative models for pharmacist prescriptive authority.
The Washington Pharmacy Act includes in the definition of practice of pharmacy "the monitoring of drug therapy and use; the initiating or modifying of drug therapy in accordance with written guidelines or protocols previously established and approved for his or her practice by a practitioner authorized to prescribe drugs;".
The Washington Board of Pharmacy reports 400 pharmacists and 2,000 physicians are participating in the program.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 27 The Colorado Act provides limited authority for pharmacists to dispense or prescribe drug therapy.
Under Â§ 12-22-122(2), C.R.S., a pharmacist may provide a 72 hour refill for a previously authorized prescription without the prescriber's authorization.
This may only be done when efforts to contact the prescriber have failed and in the professional judgment of the pharmacist, the refill is necessary for the patient.
Under Â§ 12-22-124, C.R.S., a pharmacist may, with the patients permission, substitute an equivalent drug product if the product is the same generic drug type.
Pharmacists may not substitute drugs if the prescriber or patient indicate no substitutions are to be made.
Pharmacists by education and training are qualified to evaluate drug therapies and interactions.
In fact, pharmacists have more required education in pharmacology and drug therapy than most prescribers.
However, most pharmacists do not have education and experience in diagnoses of medical conditions.
States that have extended prescriptive authority to pharmacists have done so under pre-approved protocols or in a collaborative or coordinated arrangement with a prescriber.
Colorado physicians and pharmacists report that some informal collaborative arrangements occur.
However, the Act does not define collaborative practice and the Board does not regulate the practice.
During the course of researching this report, several individuals and groups have recommended expanding the scope of practice for pharmacists to include some type of prescriptive authority.
Valid arguments have been presented as to the qualifications for pharmacists in the areas of drug therapy monitoring and dosage modification.
However, information presented did not demonstrate a potential harm to the public if the current system is maintained.
For this reason, the report is neutral on the issue of prescriptive authority for licensed pharmacists.
Chapter 4 - Sunset Analysis Page 28 The Board contracts with a private company to operate the Peer Assistance Program.
There are currently 12 participants in the program.
Public safety is ensured through monitored drug screens, treatment provider reports, and mandatory attendance at self help groups, among other services.
The contractor provides quarterly reports to the Board.
Current language in the Act requires the Board to use the Peer Assistance Program as an alternative to disciplinary action.
The legislative declaration for the Pharmacy Peer Assistance provision is more restrictive on the Board than language in other health related peer assistance legislation.
Chapter - 5 Page 29
RECOMMENDATIONS Continue the Licensing of Pharmacists and Pharmacies The value of properly prescribed and administered drug therapy is accepted in the medical community and by the general public.
The proliferation of new prescription drugs has benefited many people by providing innovative therapies for previously untreatable illnesses.
There is sufficient evidence of potential harm to the public caused by the dispensing of improper drug dosages or improper medications.
Limiting access to controlled substances serves to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
A system for regulating the prescribing, storage, and dispensing of drugs is a necessary function of state government.
Recommendation 1 - The General Assembly should continue the licensing of pharmacists and pharmacies for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
Remove Restrictions
The current Act requires that one member of the Board reside in each congressional district, and no more than four members of the Board may represent the same political party.
Efforts should be made to obtain geographic diversity in Board membership.
However, requiring membership by congressional district unnecessarily limits the pool of qualified applicants.
It is more important for the regulated community to have diverse representation by practice specialty and pharmacy type than by geographic considerations.
The interests of an independent pharmacy in an urban area will be better represented by an independent pharmacist in a rural area than they will be by a hospital pharmacist in his or her own congressional district.
Chapter 5 -Recommendations Page 30 The public and the regulated community would be best served by a Board made up of qualified, interested individuals, regardless of political party affiliation.
The function of the Board is to establish and administer a regulatory program for pharmacists and pharmacies.
Qualifications based on experience, education, and interest are more important than political party affiliation.
RECOMMENDATION 2 - Remove the restrictions on Board membership.
Clarify Terms
The terms license and registration are used inconsistently, and in some cases incorrectly throughout the Act.
Qualified pharmacists are commonly referred to as "Registered Pharmacists".
However, the Act properly grants the Board authority to license pharmacists, then refers to registered pharmacists in various sections, such as Â§ 12-22-110(1)(a), C.R.S.
Likewise, PDOs are required to register with the Board and display their registration prominently at their place of business.
However, the registration would more properly be defined as a license.
Recommendation 3 - Correct inconsistent use of the terms "license and registration".
Consolidate Classes of Licenses
The Act currently identifies four classes of licensed pharmacists.
The different classes pay the same licensing fees, and are not differentiated in their scope of practice.
They are different only in the method they obtained or in the length of time of licensure in Colorado.
Differentiating between classes of licensees does not serve a public protection function and should be eliminated.
Recommendation 4 - Consolidate the four classes of pharmacist licensees.
Chapter 5 -Recommendations Page 31 Centralize Data Collection The abuse of prescription drugs is a serious problem in Colorado.
While per capita consumption has decreased, the number of admitted abusers has continued to increase.
The problem crosses a broad spectrum of society and has direct and indirect impacts and costs to taxpayers in this state.
Sources for obtaining the abused substances vary.
Among the common sources are over prescribing or abusive prescribing by practitioners; abuse or theft by pharmacy or hospital personal; and "doctor shopping" by persons addicted to prescription drugs.
In a doctor shopping scenario, an individual may visit several physicians complaining of identical symptoms and obtain prescriptions for controlled substances from each physician.
Individuals utilizing this technique often use different pharmacies to fill the prescriptions.
This makes it virtually impossible for prescribers or pharmacists to identify abusers.
Oklahoma and New Mexico have recently implemented computer tracking systems for controlled substances distributed at the consumer level, using federal grants as a funding source.
These systems are currently being evaluated by regulatory authorities.
However, preliminary information indicates success in identification of prescription drug abusers.
Recommendation 5 - The General Assembly should consider implementing a system to centralize data collection on the dispensing of controlled substances, similar to the system in Oklahoma.
Chapter 5 -Recommendations Page 32 Examinations The General Assembly eliminated the requirement for a jurisprudence examination on licensure by endorsement effective 1988 [Â§ 12-22-116.5(1)(e), C.R.S.].
However, under the provisions of Â§ 12-22-116.5(2), C.R.S., the Board has been requiring jurisprudence examinations for some applicants applying for reinstatement of an expired license.
Also under the reinstatement provisions of Â§ 12-2-116.5(2), C.R.S., the Board requires an "out-of-practice examination" for individuals applying for reinstatement of an expired license who have not been employed as a pharmacist for at least 400 hours in the previous year.
However, a licensed pharmacist who applies for renewal of a current license does not need to document employment as a pharmacist for any period of the two year licensing cycle.
This creates an equity issue for licensees.
If an out of practice examination is necessary to protect the public, applicants for renewal should be required to demonstrate 400 hours of employment as a pharmacist or be subject to an out-of-practice examination.
Recommendation 6 The General Assembly should provide clear and consistent guidance to the Board on the issue of out-of-practice and jurisprudence examinations.
Malpractice Claims
Licensed insurance companies are required, pursuant to Â§ 1222-113.5, C.R.S. to report malpractice claims against a Colorado licensed pharmacist.
The Board has promulgated regulations requiring self insured pharmacies to report claims also.
Some large retail chains have indicated a reluctance to comply with the regulations, asserting that they are not licensed insurance companies.
Chapter 5 -Recommendations Page 33 The intent of the malpractice reporting requirement was to provide the Board with information about practices which violate provisions of the Act or Board regulations.
Instances of negligence and malpractice need to be investigated to protect the public regardless of whether the entity in question is self insured or insured by a private carrier.
Recommendation 7 - The General Assembly should require self insured pharmacists and pharmacies to report malpractice claims to the Board.
Identification of Health Care Facilities Eligible for the Placement of Emergency Kits
As the national health care system changes, new types of health care facilities are developed and utilized by a population requiring specialized care.
The Act currently limits emergency kits to nursing care, intermediate health care and residential care facilities.
The Board should have the ability to establish regulations providing emergency supplies of drugs to health care facilities licensed or regulated by the Health Facilities Division of the CDPHE.
Recommendation 8 - The General Assembly should delegate to the Board the responsibility for identification of health care facilities eligible for the placement of emergency kits.
Licensure by Examination Requirements
According to Â§ 12-22-117(1)(d), C.R.S., in order for an applicant to obtain licensure by examination in Colorado, the applicant must pass a written examination approved by the Board.
Colorado, as with 48 other states uses the NABP examination as the state approved exam.
To speed up the examination process, the NABP is considering implementing a computerized examination.
The Board should have the flexibility to approve this innovative process when it is satisfied it accurately evaluates the qualifications of examinees.
Recommendation 9 - The General Assembly should change the licensure by examination requirement from a written examination to a Board approved examination.
Chapter 5 -Recommendations Page 34 Subpoena Powers The ability to subpoena witnesses and information is a necessary tool for the investigation of regulatory violations.
The Board has assumed subpoena powers based on its broad statutory authority.
While this assumption has not been challenged, it is certainly open to such a challenge.
Providing explicit authority for subpoenas in the Act will eliminate any question as to the Boards ability in this area.
Recommendation 10 - Formalize subpoena powers of the Board.
the investigative
Permitting Provision
Among the permits, registrations, and licenses the Board approves is a permit, to destroy drugs, contained in Â§ 12-22121(10), C.R.S.
This was intended as a method to monitor the disposition of drugs when they expire or become contaminated.
As a practical matter, PDOs return outdated or contaminated drugs to the distributor or manufacture.
The Board has not issued a permit to destroy drugs in many years.
Therefore, the provision is unnecessary and should be eliminated.
Recommendation provision.
11 Eliminate unused permitting
Chapter 5 -Recommendations Page 35 Letters of Concern The Board occasionally issues confidential Letters of Concern in situations where an investigation reveals practices that are not violations, but could lead to violations of the Act or Board regulations.
The practice of issuing letters has been challenged because the Board does not have specific statutory authority to issue them.
Placing authority in the statute will eliminate any doubt for the Board and licensees as to the validity of the letter as a disciplinary measure.
Recommendation 12 - Add confidential Letters of Concern as a disciplinary option for the Board.
Licensure by Endorsement
Applicants for licensure by endorsement currently may apply directly to the Board or use the NABP clearinghouse.
On applications not using the clearinghouse, the Board is dependent upon the applicant to reveal all past disciplinary actions and state licenses held.
Applications presented directly to the Board clearly increase the administrative burden on the Board.
However, there is insufficient evidence that the public is endangered by this option.
Requiring applicants to use the NABP clearinghouse is in effect requiring them to support a private enterprise.
In order for this report to make a recommendation to this effect there would have to be overwhelming evidence of increased benefit to the public.
The current clearinghouse process is not demonstrably more efficient than direct application to the Board.
NABP is developing a system for on-line, computerized background checks on credentials and disciplinary records of applicants.
Although this would seem to add to the public protection, the system is not operational so an evaluation is not possible.
Recommendation 13 - Maintain the current option to apply directly to the Board for licensure by endorsement.
Chapter 5 -Recommendations Page 36 Peer Assistance Program The General Assembly has recently amended language relating to peer assistant and drug diversion programs in the Medical Practices and Nurse Practice Acts.
The Pharmacy Act should be amended to be consistent with other health related occupations.
"In determining appropriate disciplinary action, the Board shall first consider sanctions that are necessary to protect the public.
Only after the Board has considered such sanctions may it consider and order requirements designed to rehabilitate the licensee."
Recommendation 14 - Change language for the PEER Assistance Program to be consistent with other health related occupational licensing programs.
Large hospital complexes frequently have multiple areas for the storage and distribution of pharmaceuticals.
Regulation of these points under the current Act is burdensome on both the complex and the Board.
A definition for a satellite distribution point would allow the Board to regulate these areas efficiently.
RECOMMENDATION 15 - The General Assembly should adopt a definition for a satellite distribution point.
Administrative Recommendation s
Board regulations currently prohibit accepting a controlled substance prescription order by fax or other electronic means.
Technology is available to safeguard prescription orders transmitted electronically.
There is no evidence that electronically transmitted orders are more susceptible to fraud than verbal or handwritten prescriptions.
The Board should promulgate regulations that allow practitioners and pharmacists to utilize all reasonably secure methods to authorize the dispensing of medications.
Recommendation 1 - The Board should reevaluate its regulatory prohibition on accepting prescription orders for controlled substances by electronic means.
Chapter 5 -Recommendations Page 37 Printed, or hardcopy reports, are useful, and even necessary, when a PDO is being inspected.
This is not an everyday occurrence, and even when it does occur, PDOs have notice.
Many outlets generate these reports only to comply with Board regulations.
Other, more efficient techniques can be used to backup and store records.
Some of these methods, such as offsite data transmissions, are actually more effective in the event of a computer failure than daily hardcopy reports.
Recommendation 2 - The Board should eliminate the requirement for a daily printout of computer reports.

Public interest.
The practice of pharmacy is declared a professional practice affecting the public health, safety, and welfare and is subject to regulation and control in the public interest.
It is a matter of public interest and concern that the practice of pharmacy, as defined in this part 1, merits and receives the confidence of the public and that only qualified persons be permitted to practice pharmacy in this state.
This part 1 shall be liberally construed to carry out these objects and purposes.
Pursuant to these standards and obligations, the state board of pharmacy may adopt, by rule and regulation, rules of professional conduct.

Substitution of prescribed drugs authorized - when conditions.
(1) A pharmacist filling a prescription order for a specific drug by brand or proprietary name may substitute an equivalent drug product if the substituted drug product is the same generic drug type as defined in section 1222-102 (12) and, in the pharmacist's professional judgment, the substituted drug product is therapeutically equivalent as defined in section 12-22-102 (33), is interchangeable with the prescribed drug, and is permitted to be moved in interstate commerce.
A pharmacist making a substitution shall assume the same responsibility for selecting the dispensed drug product as he would incur in filling a prescription for a drug product prescribed by a generic name; except that he shall be charged with notice and knowledge of the federal food and drug administration list of approved drug substances and manufacturers as may be published from time to time.
(2) If, in the opinion of the practitioner, it is in the best interest of his patient that an equivalent drug not be substituted, he may so indicate on the prescription by either writing the words "dispense as written" or by initialing in his own handwriting a preprinted box labeled "dispense as written".
In no case shall a facsimile of the handwritten signature or the handwritten initials of a practitioner be preprinted to indicate "dispense as written".
If the prescription is communicated orally by the practitioner to the pharmacist, the practitioner may indicate the prohibition on substitution in the same manner and at the same time.
(3) If a substitution is made, the substitution shall be communicated to the purchaser in writing and orally, the container shall be labeled with the name of the drug dispensed, and the pharmacist shall indicate on the file copy of the prescription both the name of the prescribed drug and the name of the drug dispensed in lieu thereof.
Communication of such substitution to institutionalized patients shall not be required.
(4) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, in no case shall the pharmacist substitute a drug product as provided in this section unless the drug product substituted costs the purchaser less than the drug product prescribed.
The prescription shall be priced as if it had been prescribed generically.
(5) If a prescription drug outlet does not have in stock the prescribed drug product and the only equivalent drug product in stock is higher priced, the pharmacist, with the consent of the purchaser, may substitute the higher priced drug product.
This subsection (5) applies only to a prescription drug outlet located in a town, as defined in section 31-1-101 (13), C.R.S.
