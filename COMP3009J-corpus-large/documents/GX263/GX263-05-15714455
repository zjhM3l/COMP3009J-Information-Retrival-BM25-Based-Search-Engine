GEOLOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE GEYSER BIGHT GEOTl!IE:WMAL AREA, UMNAK ISLAND, ALEUTIAN ISLANDS, ALASKA BY C.J. Nye,l R.J. Motyh,2 D.L. Turner,3 and S.A. Lissl
ABSTRACT The Geyser Bight geothermal area is located on Umnak Island in the central Aleutian Islands.
It contains one of the hottest and most extensive areas of thermal springs and fumaroles in Alaska and is the only documented geyser site in the state.
The zone of hot springs and fumaroles lies at the head of Geyser Creek, 5 km up a broad, flat, alluvial valley from Geyser Bight.
At present, central Umnak Island is remote and undeveloped.
This report dmribzs results of a combined program of geologic mapping, K-AI dating, detailed description of hot springs, petrology and geochemistry of volcanic and plutonic rock units, and chemistry of geothermal fluids.
Our mapping shows that plutonic rock is much closer to the area of hotsprings and fumaroles than previously known, which increases the probability that plutonic rock hosts the geothermal system.
K-Ar dating of 23 samples provides a time framework for the eruptive history of volcanic rocks and a plutonic cooling age.
Heat for the geothermal system is derived from the Mt. Recheshnoi volcanic system.
Mt. Recheshnoi is a large calcalkaline stratocone that has been active over at least the past 500,000 yr. Petrochemical studies indicate that successive passage-s of magma have probably heated the crust to near its minimum melting point and produced the only high-Si@ rhyolites in the oceanic part of the Aleutian arc.
There is no indication of a large, shallow magma chamt
Surface expressions of the geothermal system include six zones of thermal springs and small geysers dispersed over a 4-km2 area and three zones of fumarolic activity.
Thermal-spring water chemistry indicates that at least two intermediate-level hydrothermal reservoirs underlie the geothermal area.
Their minimum temperatures are 165" and 2OQ"C, respectively, as estimated by geothermometry.
Sulfate-water isotope geothetmometers suggest that a deeper reservoir with a minimum temperature of 265Â°C underlies the shallower reservoirs.
The 3He/4He ratio of 7.4 found in thermal-springs gases provides evidence for a magmatic influence on the hydrothermal system.
The 7.4 value is nearly the same as the average value for summit fumaroles in circum-Pacific volcanic arcs.
The thermal-spring waters have low to moderate concentrations of Cl (650 (1760 ppm), but are rich in B (60 ppm) and As (6 ppm) compared to most other ratios in Geyser Bight thermal spring waters are among the highest reported for B and As is unknown, but may be in part of magmatic origin.
Convective estimated at 17 MW for 1988.
The reservoir system probably contains abut energy, sufficient to produce 132 MW to 225 MW of electrical power for 30 yr. ppm) and total dissolved solids geothermal systems.

Alaska where geyser activity has been documented.
Although Geyser Bight is remote and undeveloped, its accessibility from the sea and its large estimated reserve of geothermal energy should make the area an economically attractive future source of power.
Gur estimates of minimum temperatures for intermediate level reservoirs are 165 and 200Â°C; our minimum estimate for an underlying deep reservoir is 265Â°C.
Estimates of convective heat dissipated by spring flow range from about 25 MW in 1947 to 16.7 MW in 1988.
Muffler (1979) estimated that 136 MW of electrical energy are available over 30 yr at Geyser Bight, a resource comparable to Beowawe and Brady Hot Springs in Nevada.
The site is located at lat 53"13'N., long 168"28'W., at the approximate center of the north side of Umnak Island (fig. 1).
The thermal area consists of five zones of numerous thermal springs and small geysers dispersed over a 4 km2 area in the upper reaches of a broad glaciaI valley that has excellent access to the Bering Sea (fig. 1).
The hot springs occur mostly along Geyser Creek and its tributaries and emerge in the valley floor and at the base of steep valley walls.
Two small fumarole fields are located at elevations of 140 and 300 m in a small tributary valley at the headwaters of Geyser Creek.
We discovered a third, superheated fumarole field about 2.5 km south of the previously reported fields.

REGIONAL GEOLOGIC SE'ITING Recent reviews of the geology and tectonics of the Aleutian arc region are given by Scholl and others (1987) and Stone (1988).
These reviews provide a convenient entry into the extensive literature about the Aleutian arc and the Bering Sea, and are summarized here.
The part of the North American plate that underlies the Aleutian arc is oceanic we-St of 166"W., composed of a broad continental shelf between 166"W., and about 156"W., and continental east of 156"W.
The Pacific plate is oceanic throughout, except for a small sliver of continental crust at its easternmost margin.
Umnak Island and the Geyser Bight geothermal area are located just west of the oceanic-continental transition.
There are no major tectonic anomalies in the arc in the vicinity of Umnak Island.
Formation when the Kula between the arc oceanic crust is of the oceanic part of the Aleutian arc began during early Tertiary time (approximately 55 Ma) plate buckled and began to subduct beneath itself.
A piece of oceanic crust that was trapped and the edge of the Bering shelf was accreted to the North American plate.
That trapped piece of now the floor of the southwestern half of the Bering Sea.
Since that time, the Kula plate and then the Pacific plate under-thrust the margin of the North American plate.
The broad geometry of the subduction system did not change during Tertiary and Quaternary time.
Subduction under the continental part of the arc occurred at least intermittently during much of Mesozoic and Cenozoic time, although that part of the arc was not yet accreted to North America (see Panuska and Stone, 1985; Coe and others, 1985, for reviews).
The oceanic part of the Aleutian arc formed as an igneous and sedimentary welt on abyssal tic crust and grew to sea level by the end of Eocene time.
During the Oligocene and Miocene Epochs, arc growth slowed, and erosive processes became relatively more important.
The transition from early, rapid growth to waning activity was approximately coincident with the demise of the Kula-Pacific spreading center and the change in subduction angle.
Starting in Pliocene time, wave action truncated to a shallow, I lOO-km-wide platform at the summit of the ridge.
The Aleutian Islands are the emergent portions of this platform.
Quaternary volcanism is confined to a narrow belt in the northern part of the summit platform.
Rocks deposited during the early phase of rapid growth-the lower series (Scholl and others, 1987)consist of volcanic rocks, hypabyssal intrusives, stocks and plutons, and locally derived sedimentary rocks.
They are pervasively altered and lightly metamorphosed, generally at less than greenschist facies.
Lower series rocks are often broadly folded and regionally tilted.
Rocks of southwestern Umnak Island belong to the lower series and appear to have accumulated in summit basins adjacent to active volcanic centers (Iv
In the Geyser Bight area, the lower series is represented by Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks (Tvs, see p. 12).
Although exposures are limited, the unit in Geyser Creek valley appears to have a higher proportion of volcanic rocks than the unit (to the southwest) described by McLean and Hein (1984).
The middle series includes rocks deposited as volcanic activity waned during the Oligocene and Miocene Epochs (Scholl and others, 1987).
This series consists mostly of a blanket of slightly deformed, diagenetically altered, marine sedimentary rocks that drape the outer flanks of the arc.
These rocks are not exposed on Umnak Island.
The plutonic rocks in the Geyser Bight area also belong to the middle series.
Plutonic masses c4mlprise much of the middle series along the crest of the arc (see Scholl and others, 1987, for a summary of occurrences).
Large-scale structural features of the arc are described by Geist and others (1988).
These features consist of tear-away canyons and summit basins that formed by the rotation of at least five discreet blocks, each 150 to 400 km long and 125 km wide.
This blcIck rotation was presumably in response to oblique subduction in the western part of the arc.
Within these blocks, deformation is restricted to broad folding and minor faulting (Scholl and others, 1987).
Volcanoes are generally located at or continentward of the continentward limit of the blocks.
The analysis by Geist and others (1988) does not extend as far east as Umnak Island.

PREVIOUS WORK Reports of the Geyser Bight hot springs appear in Grewingk (1850), Dal1 (1870), and Waring (1917), and their existence was probably known to Aleut villagers at Nikolski since ancient time-s. Byers and Brannock (1949) conducted an extensive survey of the thermal spring areas during their reconnaissance geologic mapping of Umnak Island (1946-48) and reported analyses of water samples from two springs.
Samples from four thermal springs were collected and analyzed by Ivan Barnes (written commun., U.S. Geological Survey, 1981) in 1975 as part of a U.S. Geological Survey's reconnaissance investigation of hot-spring sites in the Aleutian arc.
In 1980, a party from the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys sampled and analyzed seven Geyser Bight thermal springs and measured spring discharges during a regional assessment of geothermal resources in the Aleutian Islands (Motyka and others, 1981).
Their preliminary studies suggested that these hot springs are fed by multiple reservoirs, with temperature ranges from 160" to 190Â°C.
These multiple reservoirs are related to a deeper parent reservoir with temperatures as high as 265'C.
Prior to this study, the most detailed geologic map of the Geyser Bight geothermal area was a 1:96,000-scale map of southwestern Umnak Island produced during a 6-wk reconnaissance in 1947 (Byers, 1959).
This map shows the major rmk units that we subsequently mapped in more detail during 1988.
McLean and Hem (1984) provide additional detail on Tertiary rocks southwest of Umnak's volcanoes.
Byers (1959) provides petrographic descriptions and some chemical analyses of many rock units found in the Geyser Bight area, and Byers (1961) provides detailed petrogenetic interpretations of the chemistry and mineralogy of central Umnak volcanic rocks.
However, his interpretations focus on petrogenetic processes rather than the temporal and stratigraphic evolution of volcanic systems that are the focus of this study.
PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THXS STUDY The purpose of this resource assessment is twofold: (1) to obtain new geologic and gmhemical data for one of Alaska's most promising geothermal resource areas, and (2) to produce an integrated analysis of the resource with more accurate estimates of reservoir temperatures and the magnitude of energy available for future development.
As fossil fuels become scarce, industry may be forced to locate in regions with readily available energy.
Thus, the Geyser Bight area may 
Altough the central Aleutians are sparsely populated and remote, rapid growth of the American bottom-fish industry in the Bering Sea and northern Pacific Ocean, and increased oil and gas exploration in the Bering Sea are generating an increased need for power in the region.
This industrial growth may make development of highquality, relatively remote geothermal resources attractive.
Economic feasibility studies at Dutch Harbor (145 km east on Unalaska Island) show that the cost of electrical production using the Makushin geothermal resource is competitive with diesel-fired generators given sufficiently high flow rates in the geothermal wells (Spencer and others, 1982).
The high cost of developing the M

LAND STATUS AND ACCESSIBILITY The Geyser Bight geothermal area is located on federal land under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
It, as well as the Hot Springs Cove geothermal area 6 km to the northeast (fig. 1) are contained in the Geyser Springs Basin Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGR4).
BLM, and under a cooperative agreement, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, will be involved in lease sales, drilling permits and any further exploration or development of this resource.

Under the guidelines of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), native Alaskan groups and the State of Alaska can select federal land up to their entitlement limits.
The Aleut Native Corporation, the St. George Village Ass
The State of Alaska has also tentatively selected land in the southern part of the KGRA, in an area that includes the superheated fumarole site (F3, sheet l), but does not include any hot spring areas.
The State has until January 2, 1994, to make additional selections.
BLM is responsible for adjudicating land claims, and, by the rules of ANCSA, gives preference to native groups, once the State determines that its interests are not compromised.
Hot Springs Cove and Russian Bay are two (of several) semi-protected bays near the Geyser Bight geothermal area.
With breakwater construction and/or dredging, a suitable deep-water harbor could be constructed at one or more of these sites.
The flat floor and gentle slope of Geyser Creek valley would accommodate a road from the bzach to the thermal area, a distance of only 5 km.
In addition, a large airfield is located at Fort Glenn (World War II, abandoned) on the east end of the island, about 50 km from Geyser Creek valley, and an unimproved road leads from Fort Glenn to within 15 km of Geyser Bight.
Field work for this project was conducted on foot from a tent camp in the lower Geyser Creek valley.
Field gear was flown from Fairbanks to Nikolski, the nearest village to Geyser Bight.
Gear and personnel were transported from Nikolski to the field site by two inflatable boats and one aluminum skiff.
We ran through light surf into the mouth of Geyser Creek and then lined and motored halfway through the dune field to our campsite.
We also used the inflatable boats to locate a spike camp at Hot Springs Cove.
Surf conditions at Geyser Bight generally make small boat operations unsafe.
Any larger field effort, or a field effort requiring heavy equipment, would probably be bz.st conducted using a landing craft from Dutch Harbor.
GEOLOGY OF THE GEYSER BIGHT AREA OVERVIEW The oldest rocks on central Umnak Island are fine-grained Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks of low metamorphic grade (Tvs, sheet 1).
These rocks, along with the late Miocene dioritic pluton that intrudes them (Tdp, sheet l), form the base of a broad, wave-cut platform 100 to 200 m above sea level.
Plutonic rocks as young as 9.5 Ma (this report) are cut by this surface at Geyser Bight.
This major unconformity was formed in Pliocene time and is regional in extent (Scholl and others, 1987).
Quaternary volcanic rocks spanning at least 1.5 m.y. (this report) were erupted from several deposited on this platform.
These volcanoes and their eroded remnants provide 600 m of relief in vicinity of Geyser Bight valley.
The older of these volcanoes had vents northeast of Geyser Bight remnants of these volcanoes consist of central vent complexes surrounded by lava flows which outward.
Extensive erosion has obscured the constructional morphology od these volcanoes. volcanoes and the immediate (fig. 2).

Mt. Vsevidof, 6 km west-southwest of Mt. Recheshnoi, is an active volcano that appears to be dominantly Holocene in age.
Flows from Mt. Vsevidof do not crop out in the Geyser Creek area.
The hot springs, fumaroles, and geysers of the Geyser Bight area are located at the head of a large Pleistocene valley cut in the bedrock units discussed above.

Active beaches at Geyser Bight and Russian Bay are composed of well-sorted, medium- to coarse-grained sand.
Beach faces are moderately steep due to frequent moderate to heavy surf.
Alluvial silt, sand, and gravel till the bottoms of Geyser Creek valley and Russian Bay valley.
Modern streambeds contain pebbles up to a few centimeters in diameter.
Areas adjacent from the streams can be underlain by peat and overbank mud of undetermined thickness.

The-se valleys presumably formed when the glacially carved Pleistocene valleys were drowned by post-glacial rise in sea level.
The resultant deep bays were isolated by bay-mouth bars to produce lakes that were then filled by alluvium and overbank silt, lagunal and lacustrine deposits, and tephra.
Till probably underlies the alluvium.
If this model is correct, fill in Geyser Creek valley and Russian Bay valley may be quite thick and formed of a complex intertonguing of till, alluvial sand and gravel, very fine grained overbank and lacustrine silt and peat, and tephra.
Because substantial deposition may have occurred at or below sea level, average grain-s
Alluvium in Geyser Creek valley is probably very thin near the head of the valley.
Makushin valley is similar in size and, perhaps, history to Geyser Creek valley.
Near its downstream end, it contains about 7 m of sod and organic-rich silt underlain by 22 m of water-saturnted silt and fine sand, in turn underlain by 20 m of till(?) (Krause, 1986).
DUNE SAND (Qd)
The beaches at Geyser Bight and Russian Bay are backed by extensive fields of inactive, vegetated dunes composed of well-sorted, medium- to coarse-grained sand similar to beach sand.
Older dunes (farther from the beaches) are often mantled by one-cm-thick red and black tephra layers with an aggregate thickness of a few meters.
Dunes are typically 15-20 m high (locally as much as 45 m high) at Geyser Bight and 35 m high at Russian Bay.
Irregular piles and hummocks of unstratified, locally derived boulders and cobbles lie in shallow, gently sloping basins perched above major valleys.
These deposits are probably latest Pleistocene in age.
Total thiclcnesses of individual deposits are at least several meters.
These are the only late Pleistocene glacial deposits in the map area.
Byers (1959) shows Pleistocene and neoglacial moraines on the flanks of Mt. Recheshnoi, southwest of the area shown on sheet 1.
Similar hummocky drift deposits occupy similar shallow alpine valleys elsewhere on the island, usually on the flanks of Mt. Recheshnoi.
An older glacial drift unit (Qgd) is described below.

UNDIFFERENTIATED COLLUVIUM (Qc) Colluvium of undetermined origin was mapped where it was thick enough to prevent accurate determination of underlying bedrock.

several tens of centimeters thick.
The tephra is of lapilli-sized pumice.
This unit was mapped and includes some small bedrmk outcrops too
RHYOLJTE (Qr) At least seven small rhyolite bodies occur along an east-west zme south of Russian Bay valley.
The outcrops range from 0.5 to 0.1 km2 (sheet 1).
The rhyolite forms dense, flow-banded outcrops in which the flow banding is typically subparallel to the trend of the outcrops and steeply dipping.
The rhyolite is glassy to devitrified and sparsely phyric.
Phenocrysts consist of plagioclase, biotite, quartz, and minor opaque oxides.
The unit also contains rounded inclusions of typical Recheshnoi andesite up to several centimeters in diameter.
-7-
These inclusions contain approximately 10% plagioclose + clinopyroxene + olivine set in a fine-grained, quenched groundmass and appear to have been incorporated when the rhyolite was molten.
Biotite from one rhyolite outcrop was dated at about 135 ka (see p. 16).
The strongly linear outcrop pattern, high density, steeply dipping and contorted flow banding suggest that all rhyolite outcrops may be part of a single, near-vertical, dike-like body.
The lack of any associated subareal deposits or subhorizontal structure indicates that the rhyolite is not the eroded remnant of an ashflow or subareal lava flow.
The larger bc
Rhyolite outcrops are spatially discreet, and rhyolite is not exposed in gullies between outcrops, which suggests that only lingers of the postulated dike reached the surface.
HOLOCENEANDESlTE(Qaf) Holocene andesite flows extend from small vents high on the eastern and western slopes of Mt. Recheshnoi (fig. 2).
None of these flows are within the map area of sheet 1.
We sampled the two easternmost flows identified by Byers (1959).
The older flow erupted from a vent at about 700 m elevation and flowed about one km horizontally and 350 m vertically down the flank of the volcano.
The younger flow erupted from a vent at about 1260 m elevation and flowed 6 km down the flank of the volcano to terminate among Holocene beach ridges.
The flows are narrow and were apparently quite fluid.
The flows are 58 percent Si
Most plagioclase is normally zoned, but the older flow contains a small proportion of resorbed, reversely zoned, and/or spongy plagioclase phenocrysts.
The younger flow contains rounded inclusions of highly vesicular olivine + clinopyroxene f plagioclase-phyric
basaltic andesite (about 55 percent Si
The inclusions which appear to have been mixed into a liquid host andesite, resemble the quenched basaltic blobs described by Eichelberger (1975) from Glass Mountain in Oregon.
Although moss and some grass cover the older flow, most aspects of flow morphology are unaltered.
The younger flow is much less vegetated with well-preserved lateral levees and concentric ropy flow structures in its lower part; the upper part of the flow is blocky.
Black (1975) states that the younger flow was deposited during a neoglacial advance and is thus about 3,000 yr old.
Basaltic andesite scoria and stubby lava flows erupted from a small vent on the ridge crest between Hot Springs Gove and Partov Gove.
The outcrop area is about 2 km by 1 km, elongated to the east-northeast.
A closed depression about 250 m diam and 10 m deep in the west-central part of the unit is probably the original vent.
The northern part of the unit is composed of agglutinated scoria and bombs (a few to several centimeters diameter) that probably represent the remains of a cinder cone.
Steep-Fronted concentric lobes that represent stubby flows that issued from the base of the former cone make up the eastern part of the unit.
Flow tops are massive andesite cut by shallow eastward drainages.
Although rubbly flow tops and cinders were not found they probably formed during the initial eruption and were removed when Umnak Island was buried by glacial ice.
Because these flows erupted about 89 ka (see p. 16), they were exposed to most of the last glacial cycle.
However, glacial erosion was not severe enough to radically alter the initial volcanic morphology perhaps of its location at the top of a high ridge.
The unit is composed primarily of basaltic andesite with about 54 percent Si@.
The lavas are compositionally similar to other lavas from the area except for the high MgO content which may reflect magma mixing within the unit.
AE noted by Byers (1959), the mineralogy of these lavas is unusual in that they contain plagioclase, magnesian olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, magnetite, and some embayed betaquartz.
The complexity of this mineral assemblage suggests magma mixing.
The unit also contains mafic clots with about 65 volume percent crystals that are dominantly hornblende pseudomorphs.
The clots also contain phenocrysts of plagioclase, olivine, and clinopymxene.
The groundmass consists of quenched plagioclase, pyroxene, and glass (mostly devitrified).

LAVAS OF CINDER POKNT

Its two Cinder Point is a small, 17%m-high cinder cone on the northeast edge of Inanudak Bay (fig. 2). lobate lava flows are nearly circular in map view and about 200 m diam.
Because the summit cone is only slightly modified by erosion, it is probably early Holocene in age.
The Cinder Point cone is equidistant from Okmok Caldera to the northeast and Mt. Reche-shnoi.
It is the westernmost of five aligned vents near Inanudak Bay (Byen 1959).
Cinder Point lavas are highly porphyritic, high-alumina basalta. plagioclase crystal9 up to 5 mm long (average 1.5 mm) with thin, corroded zones.

(Qral, Qra, Qrd)
Mt. Recheshnoi is a large, heavily glaciated stratocone on central Umnak Island, southeast of Geyser Creek (fig. 2).
It is mostly late Quaternary in age (see p. 15).
The center of the cone is built on a 60-m-high flat erosional surface cut on Tertiary plutonic and sedimentary rocks.
This surface is part of the regional Aleutian summit platform which formed since 5.3 Ma (Scholl and others, 1987).
The east and northeast flanks of Mt. Recheshnoi overlie a 4 300-m-thick deposit of lava flows from older volcanoes.
The central 40 to 50 km2 (above 1000 m elevation) consist of pyroclastic beds and a vent complex (Byers, 1959) that has been heavily eroded by several small valley glaciers so that it retains no original constructional volcanic form.
The summit area consists of a 4-km-long, east-west ridge that may reflect construction from an older eastern vent and a younger western vent (Byers, 1959).
Below 1,000 m elevation the volcano consists of basalt and andesite flows with minor pyroclastic interbeds.
The original constructional surface is preserved in some upland areas between glaciers, e-specially on the western flank, and some flows fill Pleistocene glacially carved valleys.
The summit elevation is 1984 m, and deposits from the volcano cover 360 km2.
In the Geyser Creek area, this unit consists of basalt and andesite lava flows interbedded with minor pyroclastic units.
Plows typically have a thin, brick-red, rubbly bttom that grades upward into platy lava.
Thicker or more mafic flows can have massive or columnar interiors, and upper parts of the flows are rubbly and oxidized.
Intervals between flows are usually poorly exposed and contain pyroclastic material, soil, and colluvium.
Individual flows are typically 4 to 12 m thick.
Some flow9 are substantially thicker, presumably due Occasional zones several tens of meters thick are brick-red throughout with very thin platy to local pending.
flows in a mbbly matrix.
These zones may have formed during single eruptive events when very rubbly aa flows continually overran their margins.
Except for the syneruptive brick-red oxidation on flow tops and bottoms, lavas from this unit are unaltered.
All fractures in the flows are attributable to post-eruptive cooling; we observed no tectonic fractures.
Flows dip to the north, northeast, and east, away from the summit of Mt. Recheshnoi, at gentle to moderate angles.
Most flows in the map area are truncated by the large glacial valleys that terminate at Geyser Bight and Russian Bay.
These flows are shown as Qra on sheet 1.
In contrast, valley-tilling flows (C
These deposits consist of debris flows, lahars, a
West of the head of Russian Bay valley, these poorly consolidated deposits are deeply incised by very steep-walled gullies.
An ashflow is preserved in small benches on the northeast side of Russian Bay valley and in thicker deposits on the southern side of the valley.
These flows are probably late Pleistocene to early Holocene in age and are, except for flows from flank vents, among the most recent deposits of Mt. Recheshnoi.
An unusually large, steeply dipping, northeast-trending dike (Qrd, sheet 1) was mapped south of the pass between Geyser Creek and Russian Bay valley.
The dike, which is easily distinguished on small-scale radar images and photographs, forms a barrier to stream flow and has ponded a small patch of alluvium just below the pass into Geyser Creek.
It is mantled by glacial drift.
-9-
Mt. Recheshnoi lavas are usually porphyritic and contain 25 to 40 volume percent phenocrysts.
Aphyric lavas are rare.
Plagioclase is ubiquitous and occurs in two major textural varieties.
The first variety is characterized by euhedral, unzoned or normally zoned, twinned, inclusion-free crystals that occur as large tabular crystals and as smaller prismatic crystals.
The second variety is characterized by tabular rounded and resorbed crystals that may be reverse zoned and often contain spongy zones or cores.
Lavas with less than 56.5 percent Si@ contain prismatic euhedral to subhedral olivine crystals.
Some high-silica andesites also contain olivine.
Stubby, prismatic clinopyroxene crystals are ubiquitous.
Most andesites-but few basaltscontain elongated prisms of subhedral orthopyroxene.
Grthopyroxene concentrations are usually less than clinopyroxene concentrations.
Titanomagnetite is a common accessory phase.
Hornblende was found in one sample.
GLACIAL DRIFT (Qgd) A section of glacial drift S 800 m thick is exposed in the southwest wall of Geyser Creek valley, stratigraphically between lavas of Mt. Recheshnoi and the volcanics of central Umnak (see below).
Thick massive sections of the drift are coarsely bedded and poorly sorted.
These thicker sections contain rounded and
Thinner, very fine-grained, wellsorted, tuffaceous(?), laminations about 1 cm thick are also present.
Lava flows @T88-17 and DT88-5) that provide younger and older limiting ages for the drift have been dated at 499 k 14 and 1,104 f 37 ka, respectively (sheet 1; p. 16).
The drift was probably deposited between the intervals of volcanic activity on central Umnak Island and Mt. Recheshnoi.
Geochronologic data suggest that this time was between 500 and 800 ka. VOLCANICS OF CENTRAL UMNAK ISLAND (Qcuv)
The volcanics of central Umnak lie stratigraphically beneath Mt. Recheshnoi (Qcuv, sheet 1) and are stratigraphically equivalent to Byers' (1959) QTv.
We use a different unit label than Byem on sheet 1 because the unit does not contain Tertiary rocks (p. 17).
Lavas and pyroclastic rocks were erupted from several small, early Pleistocene vents on central Umnak Island (fig. 2).
Because the vents are outside the map area of sheet 1, much of this discussion relies on Byers (1959).
Four to six of the vents are now exposed.
This unit is covered by Okmok Volcano to the northeast and Mt. Recheshnoi to the southwest: thus additional vents may be hidden.
The exposed volcanoes are heavily eroded, 3 to 7 km diam, and 
Individual vents have outwardly dipping basalt and andesite flows and a central core dominated by breccia, tuff, and feeder dikes.
Byers (1959) mapped several zones of altered, silicified, or K-fehispathized rocks.
We did not visit these areas.
In the Geyser Bight area, the unit consists of south- to southwest-dipping basaltic and andesitic lava flows with minor pyroclastic and brecciated inte
Lava flows are similar in appearance and composition to those from Mt. Recheshnoi (see above), but aphyric and sparsely phyric lavas are more common, and resorbed and corroded plagioclase is less abundant.
This unit is recognized in the field by the south to southwest dip of its lavas (into Mt. Recheshnoi and away from central Umnak Island) and by the lack of both alteration and persistent tectonic fracture pattern exhibited by the underlying TVS unit.

PLUTON (Tap)
Dioritic and momnitic plutonic rock
These rocks may be part of a larger plutonic body that crops out in a few locations at the base of Mt. Recheshnoi and Mt. Vsevidof (Byers, 1959).
This larger plutonic body may be a single large pluton or an amalgamation of several smaller bodies of Oligocene to Miocene age.
Because outcrop is not continuous, field evidence of multiple plutons could not be obtained.
For convenience, we will refer to all plutonic rock as a single pluton.

Individual outcrops of plutonic rock are fairly homogeneous, medium grained, and equigranular.
Fractures are usually spaced a few to a few tens of centimeters apart.
Individual outcrops often bear several fracture sets at different azimuths and dips.
There is no single pervasive joint orientation on either outcrop or regional scale.
Steeply dipping mafic and andesitic dikes a few tens of centimeters to a few meters across are common, but there is no strongly preferred orientation.
Plutonic samples in the Geyser Creek valley and on the shore of Geyser Bight are pyroxene-hornblende quartz monzonite and pyroxene-biotite-hornblende quartz diorite (table 1, fig. 3).
Samples from near Geyser Bight are quartz diorite or plagioclase-rich quartz monzonite.

Much of the K-spar occurs as late-stage intergrowths with quartz, which suggests that the KzO-rich nature of the rocks is related to the evolution of a KaO-rich magma rather than to the accumulation of feldspar phenocrysts.

They probably are not genetically related, but rather reflect independent per

TERTIARYSEDIMENTARYANDVOLCANICROCKS(Tvs) The oldest rook unit in the Geyser Bight ares consists of lightly metamorphosed lava flows, dikes, sills, and sedimentary and volcanogenic elastic rocks of Tertiary age.
The largest exposures of this unit are at the southwestern end of Umnak Island where there are no overlying volcanic units.
According to Byers (1959), the unit consists of gently dipping mafic lava flows with subordinate beds of argillite and tuff, all of which were intruded by gabbro and diorite that were subsequently albitized.
These rocks are gently folded and crosscut by minor faults (Byers, 1959), fracturing is pervasive.
McLean and Hein (1984) report late Eocene to early Oligocene ages for these rocks, In the Geyser Bight area, the unit is dominantly composed of fine-grained, equigranular to porphyritic hypabyssal and extrusive rnafic and intermediate igneous rocks.
The unit occurs as screens and blocks within the pluton and overlies the pluton on the east and west sides of Geyser Creek valley.
The maximum thickness exposed in the Geyser Bight region is about 150 m.
The upper surface has gently rolling topography identical to that elsewhere on the broad, wave-cut platform that truncates this unit.
The contact beetween the Tertiary volcanic sequence and the pluton is irregular and occasionally of moderate relief.
In the Geyser Bight area, alteration of these Tertiary rocks is common.
In one exposure on the southwestern side of Geyser Creek valley, hornblende quartz diorite in the lower valley wall crops out immediately below highly altered and
Pyroxene-plagioclase andesite overlying the pluton on the east side of Geyser Creek valley is pervasively chloritized and in some localities silicified or pyritized.
Quartz veining is pervasive.
On the east side of the Geyser Bight beach, the unit is fine grained, but the presence of elongated plagioclase microlites suggests that the unit is volcanic rather than sedimentary.
Unequivocally sedimentary units of TVS were not seen in the Geyser Bight area.
T VS is distinguished from overlying volcanic rocks by its pervasive tectonic fracture pattern and lack of well= preserved volcanic features.
In addition, it is usually highly altered.

only the oldest rocks (TVS ) on central Umnak Island have been deformed, and these only gently.
Reds usually have gentle dips, folds are open, and faults and fracturea, although numerous, do not have large displacements (Byers, 1959).
South of Mt. Vsevidof, folds trend northwest and large fractures trend northeast (Byers, 1959).
The amount of TVS outcrop in Geyser Creek valley was not sufficient to allow recognition of folds or faults.
Plutonic rocks are well fractured in surface outcrops.
Fractures are spaced a few centimeters to a few tens of centimeters apart.
Most outcrops have several rather than a prominent joint act; we did not observe any jointing in a preferred direction in the map area.
Dikes in the pluton have no preferred alignment.

An important feature of the Nakamura and others (1977) hypothesis is that flank volcanic features are expected to be aligned parallel to the maximum compressive stress.

N.47"W., which is the convergence direction between the Pacific and North American sheets (Jacob and others, 1977).
This east-west trend is also reflected in the attitudes of many near-vertical dikes at Geyser Bight, Cemetery Cove, and Stepanof Cove.
The largest dike we observed in the Geyser Creek area is part of Mt. Recheshnoi volcano and crops out between Geyser Creek valley and Russian Bay valley.
Its trend is nearly orthogonal to that predicted by Nakamura and others (1977).
Our geologic mapping and cross sections (sheet 1) indicate that valley fill is very thin at the head of the valley and that plutonic rock extends much farther up the valley than shown by Byers (1959).
We propose that geothermal reservoirs will most likely occur in the highly fractured plutonic rock.
TVS may also be present, as shown on cross section B-B' (sheet 1).
Exploratory drilling at Makushin volcano demonstrated the ability of plutonic rooks to sustain fracture permeability sufficient to host a geothermal reservoir.
VOLCANIC HAZARDS Because the Aleutian arc is the locus of intense volcanism, volcanic hazards may be present anywhere within the arc.
However, at Geyser Bight and in Geyser Creek valley, the volcanic hazards are surprisingly slight despite the presence of two active volcanoes.
Mt. Vsevidof, which is unglaciated and therefore has had numerous Holocene eruptions, is 18 km southwest of Geyser Creek valley, but the large size of Mt. Recheshnoi and the 300-m-high ridge southwest of Geyser Creek protect Geyser Creek from flow hazards from Mt. Vsevidof.
Historic volcanic activity at Mt. Vsevidof has been restricted to minor explosions and steaming.
If this pattern of eruption continues, future activity may deposit minor amounts of ash in Geyser Creek valley.
Okmok Volcano, 30 km to the northeast, is the most active volcano on Umnak Island.
Following two midHolocene, caldera-forming eruptions, activity has been restricted to steaming, minor ash emissions, and the emplacement of basaltic lava flows on the caldera floor.
Future activity is expected to follow the sam+z pattemquiet, effusive flows accompanied by minor ash eruptions.
The caldera wall is about 300 m high and breached only to the northeast.
If lava erupts in sufficient volume to leave the caldera, it will probably exit through the northeast
We lack adequate data to judge the probability of explosive eruptions or eruptions from centers outside Okmok Caldera.
Geyser Creek valley is separated from Okmok Volcano by Inanudak Bay and a 600-m-high ridge.
Thus it is well protected from volcanic activity originating at Okrnok (fig. 2).
Mt. Recheshnoi (10 km southwest of Geyser Creek valley) is the closest volcano to the geothermal area.
Because the central cone is highly eroded, it is probably entirely Pleistocene in age.
A few Holocene flank eruptions, including and
The rhyolite bodies and quartzand
Insufficient data preclude estimating the recurrence interval of Holocene eruptions, but the probability of volcanic flows entering Geyser Creek valley seems small.
Geyser Creek valley is protected from flowage hazards by a high ridge ween the valley and Mt. Recheshnoi.
No Holocene mass-flow deposits have been found in Geyser Creek valley or Russian Bay valley.
The most likely volcanic hazard is ash fall, which could present a temporary hazard to machinery and aircraft operation.
Holocene tephra 34 m in cumulative thickness occurs throughout the Geyser Creek area.
GEOCHRONOLOGY OF VOLCANIC AND PLUTONIC EVENTS BACKGROUND We have completed `%-40Ar age analyses for 23 andesite flows, one rhyolite plug, and the plutonic rock that may host the reservoir for the Geyser Bight geothermal system.
These results provide a time framework for the mapped rock units and for the evolution of the magmatic system that drives the geothermal resource.
ANALYTICAL METHODS AND RELIABILITY OF YOUNG AGES All andesite samples were dated as whole rocks.
Biotite from the rhyolite plug was dated, and biotite and hornblende from the pluton were dated.
Replicate potassium was measured using LiB@ flux fusion and flame photometry with a lithium internal standard.
Mineral standards were used to calibrate the photometer.
Argon - 14-
isotopes were measured by isotope dilution on a computerized, 6-in-radius mass spectrometer.
Analytical data for the 40K-40Ar age determinations are given in table 2, and sample localities are shown on sheet 1.

Reducing air-argon contamination from the extraction system by replacing quartz-lined, air-cooled fusion bottles with water-cooled, unlined bottles.
Boiling whole-rock samples (crushed to 16-48 mesh) for 1 hr in distilled water immediately before loading them in the extraction system resulted in significantly lower atmospheric argon per unit sample weight in about 30 percent of the samples.
The reason for this effect is not well understi; it was observed empirically by G.H. Curtis, R.E. Drake, and A.L. Deino (University of California, Berkeley) and communicated to Turner, who pro
Gne possibility is that the atmospheric argon in cracks in the sample may be replaced by hydrogen during boiling (R.E. Drake, oral corn.).
As a general procedure, argon from one sample fusion is split into two to four aliquots that are sequentially analyzed on the mass spectrometer.
The first split is used to "flush" the spectrometer to reduce the memory effect in static gas analysis.
This effect is particularly important when analyzing young samples with small amounts of radiogenic 4oAr, such as most of the Umnak Island andesites.
Results from these "flushing splits" were averaged with the subsequent splits only when they were statistically equivalent.
Results from the remaining splits were averaged to calculate the values of radiogenic 4oAr, percent radiogenic 4oAr, and age (table 2).
With one exception (SSCNUS53, the argon analyses in this study represent single fusions of each sample.

RESULTS With some exceptions, ages of the 23 dated samples agree with observed stratigraphic relationships.
The dates provide a well-constrained time framework for the area's eruptive history and a cooling age for the plutonic rock that may host the geothermal system.
Ages are discussed from youngest to oldest, in the approximate order shown in table 2.
The youngest flows (Qrf) from Mt. Recheshnoi proved too young to date, but three of the upper conebuilding flows (Qm) yielded ages of 75, 121, and 2 110 ka (minimum age based on petrographic criteria), Lower in the Qra section, we obtained an age of 258 ka from the northeast side of Geyser Creek valley, and ages of 285 and 478 ka from flows above Hot Springs Cove.
Basal Recheshnoi flows on the southwest side of Geyser Creek valley yielded ages of 472, 489, 534, and 499 ka.
These radiometric ages for Mt. Recheshnoi flows range from 75 f 11 to 534 f 13 ka at the base of the section.
The 478-h Qra age is problematic because it is from a flow that is located only one or two flows below the flow dated at 285, ka in the same section.
We observed no evidence of a paleosol or fault separating the two dated flows, and field relations suggest that these flows should be similar in age.
Because the 478
The sample meets petrographic reliability criteria for whole-rclck K-Ar dating.
Excess argon is not normally found in significant amounts in subaerial lava flows and is unlikely to be present in the dated sample.
At present, we cannot resolve this problem.
Fortunately, it does not affect the documented age span for Mt. Recheshnoi flows (Qra) discussed above.

Sample 88GPU7 is from the easternmost and largest of the seven biotite rhyolite plugs (Qr) above Russian Bay (sheet 1).
Biotite from the rhyolite yielded an age of 135 f 15 ka. Sample 88CNU55 is from the quartz-olivine andesite flows (Qrq) that overlie Qra above Hot Springs cove.
The 89 ka age for this unit is older than expected but geologically feasible.
The well-preserved, concentric flow fronts, visible on air photos suggest that the unit is unglaciated, but, field inspection shows that rubbly flow tops have been removed, p resumably by glacier ice.
The position of this unit on a high, broad ridge uncut by canyons suggests that it was probably overlain by a broad, slow-moving icefield that only slightly eroded the underlying rocks, thus preserving the concentric flow-front morphology.
The uppermost Q-a section directly below this unit was dated at 285 f 9 ka and provides the only available older age constraint for the Qrq unit.
Volcanic flows of central Umnak Island (Qcuv) underlie north of Geyser Creek valley.
Five samples from the Qcuv 786 f 21 ka yr in the upper part of the section to 1,124 f 48 the top of the Qcuv section (above Hot Springs Cove) yielded Qcuv flows is therefore documented at 4 786 f 21 to 1,124 f the Qra unit.
Their attitudes indicate source vents unit that flanks Geyser Creek valley range from ka at the base of the section.

Pyroclastic rocks (Qcup) at Stepanof Cove, presumed by Byera (1959) to be equivalent in part to the Qcuv unit, yielded a minimum age of 2 1,368 
The dated sample is from a radially fractured at
This minimum age-about 140 ka older than the oldest age we obtained from the base of the Qcuv section.
Two samples from a single, 1.3 m-thick dike that intrudes the dated pyroclastic unit (Qcup) at Stepanof Cove yielded ages of 1,365 f 41 and 1,613 f 56 ka.
The significantly different ages are due to variations in radiogenic 4oAr content per gram of sample @I tassium contents are essentially identical).
We conclude that the quickly chilled dike rock contains variable amounts of excess argon and that the younger age probably better reflects the true cooling age of the dike.
The younger age is concordant with the minimum age of 2 1,368 f 54 ka for the pyroclastic unit intruded by the dike.
These data suggest two interpretations for the age of the pyroclastic (Qcup) unit: (1) the pyroclastic unit may be significantly older than the minimum age of 2 1,368 k 54 ka, or (2) the concordant Qcup and younger dike ages may reflect the true cooling age for these units (about 1.4 Ma), and the dike may have been a feeder for the pyroclastic eruption.
Sample I)T88-1A from the plutonic rock unit (Tdp) collected at the east side of Geyser Bight yielded concordant biotite and hornblende ages of 9.64 f 0.29 and 9.40 f 0.28 Ma, respectively.
These concordant ages indicate that the dated pluton had a simple cooling history; it cooled through the argon-blocking temperatures for hornblende and biotite (from 530" f 40Â°C to 280" f 40Â°C) at about 9.5 Ma.
Cooling must have occurred in less than 300 ka (standard deviation of ages) for the ages to be concordant.
McLean and Rein (1984) report 31-33 Ma plutonic and hypabyssal rocks from southwestern Umnak Island.
Our much younger date for plutonic rock at Geyser Bight indicates that there have been at least two episodes of Tertiary plutonism on the Island.
The 9.5 Ma pluton is the youngest rock on Umnak truncated by the regional wave-cut surface of the Aleutian summit platform.

INTRODUCTION The chemical compositions of magmas change in response to igneous processes.
By measurmg the composition of erupted magmas, we can recognize the processes that operated during the life of the volcanic system.
This approach provides direct information about the magmatic plumbing system that is the source of geothermal heat.
Among the recognized processes are fractional crystallization, magma mixing, and variations in partial melting.
During fractional crystallization, crystals with compositions different than the host magma separate and drive the composition of the remaining liquid along a specific path.
Mixing of chemically distinct magma batches also produces recognizable chemical trends.
Initial melts produced in the source region have recognizable chemical features that reflect the origin and mode of melting.
In addition, temporal variations in
- 17 -
chemistry provide direct information about the evolution of the plumbing system.
In some cases, inferences about the location and size of the dominant magma chamber can be made.
In this report, we describe the chemical composition of Geyser Bight magmas and interpret variations in chemical composition in terms of igneous processes that can constrain the geologic evolution of the geothermal system.
Data were obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy at the University of California, Santa Crux.
Duplicate analyses of all samples indicate that mean analytical precision is less than 1.5 relative percent for Si
Sample locations are shown on sheet 1 and figure 5.
All analytical data are shown in table 3.
CHEMICAL VARIATION OF LAVAS Harker diagrams of Geyser Bight lavas are shown in figure 6.
Most samples are medium-K am
In most respects the basalt and andesite are compositionally similar to other Aleutian lavas.
FeOf (total iron as FeO), MgO, CaO, and AI203 fall with increasing Si%; K20 increases dramatically; and Na20 and Ti@ are scattered.
Scatter in AI203 and, to a lesser extent TiR, is probably related to differential crystal accumulation.
Scatter in Na20 is partially due to analytical imprecision.
Most samples falI within the talc-alkaline field of Miyashiro (1974).
Most samples that faII above or near the Th-Ca dividing line are part of a chemically anomalous high FeOt, high Ti
Samples from Mt. Recheshnoi are strongly calcalkahne; Mt. Recheshnoi is among the most calcaIkahne volcanoes in the Aleutian arc and bears many similarities to the calcalkaline volcanoes of the eastern arc.
A continuum of compositions existsbetween 50 percent and 63 percent Siti, but no magmas have between 63 percent and 76 percent Si
Rhyolitic samples were taken from the rhyolite domes west of Russian Bay valley and from granophyres within the pluton.
Rhyolite is rare in Pleistocene Aleutian volcano, and is only known from 4 centers other than Recheslmoi: (1) a small pod on the flank of Okmok caldera, 35 km to the northeast; (2) a few pumice samples from Shishaldin; (3) Novarupta, the site of the climactic 1912 eruption of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes; and (4) a single pumice sample from Augustine volcano.
only Novarupta (loo0 km east along the arc) has erupted more silicic magma.
A group of samples most noticeable in FeO' vs Si@ (fig. 6) defmea a trend parallel to the main evolutionary trend but with higher iron contents.
These samples are also characterized by high Ti
These samples are referred to as the high FeTi group.
Samples in this group include lavas erupted from the central Umnak Island vents at intervals throughout their lifetimes (but not all Qcuv samples); some recent lavas from Mt. Rechesbnoi; the Holocene Recheshnoi andesite flows (Q-f); and samples from quenched blobs within the rhyolite.
Quartz andesite samples are not part of the high FeTi group.
The group of samples at lower FeO' are probably not related to the sparsely phyric, high FeTi group by simple crystal accumulation because that accumulation should raise both FeOL and MgO.
Instead, crystal-rich samples have lower Fe and higher Mg. Plutonic rocks are compositionally similar to Recheshnoi and central Umnak andesites except for the high K20 content of quartz monzonites and granophyres, but not quartz diorites.
This p resumably reflects some unspecified difference in petrogenetic pmcesses between plutonic and volcanic rocks.
Because the plutonic samples are not related to the present magmatic plumbing system, they are not discussed here; their composition is described in the discussion of map units (p. 11).
Cinder Point is a small, monogenetic cone on the flanks of Okmok Volcano whose composition and history probably have little bearing on the Recheshnoi geothermal system.
Cinder Point samples differ from rrmst other samples; they have high AlzO3, CaO, and normative plagioclase and low MgO.
They also have large, monomineralic, polycrystalbne, plagioclase aggregates, often rounded and embayed, up to 5 mm diam.
The composition of the Cinder Point samples probably reflects selective cry

PETROGENFSXS OF LAVAS Processes that may interrelate these lavas include fractional crystallization, variable P-T-Pm0 fractionation path, magma mixing, crystal sorting, crustal assimilation, crustal melting, and variations in primary magmas.
Each process is discussed below.
It is difficult to identify the correct operational process without additional trace element and isotopic data, and evert with that data, it is often difficult to construct exact petrogenetic models.
Nevertheless, we can make some first-order qualitative observations.
CRYSTAL FRACTIONATION
Much coq
Separation of 70 percent of plagioclase f olivine + clinopyroxene f orthopyroxene + magnetite crystals (by weight) can account for similar compositional variations in other Aleutian volcanoes of similar bulk composition (for example Kay and others, 1982; Nye and Turner, 1990).
However, scatter about expected fractionation trends in most variation diagrams requires the involvement of other secondary processes.

MAGMA MCUNG Magma mixing is difficult to quantify with only major element whole-rmk geochemical data and petrographic data.
Quantitative tests of magma mixing require modelling of incompatible and compatible trace elements and through knowledge of phenocrysts composition.
However, some compositional aspects of Geyser Bight lavas suggest that magma mixing may be common.
First, two textural types of plagioclase commonly occur within the lavas (table 3).
One population is euhedral to subhedral, normally zoned, and inclusion free; the other population is rounded and resorbed (often with euhedral rims), has reversals in zoning, and usually contains discrete concentric zones of glassy inclusions.
The morphology of the latter plagioclase reflects a period of disequilibrium that may be associated with magma or the amount mixing or xenocryst entrainment.
Measuring the chemical difference between the two plagioclases of chemical change across the boundary between the spongy zone and the euhedral rim would allow assessment of the magma-mixing hypothesis.
In andesitic systems, these differences are often greater than those caused by polybaric fractionation or changes in the partial pressure of water (see Gill, 1981, for discussion).
Second, the covariation of K20 with MgO is not as expected for magmas related by fractional crystallization.
Figure 7 shows all Geyser Bight samples and a calculated path for about 70 percent fractional crystallization from a parent with 0.4 percent K20 and 10 percent MgO.
The path assumes that MgO behaves as a compatible trace element with a solid/liquid distribution coefficient (Kd) of 2.2, and that KzO has a Kd of 0.
Because K20 is not an essential constituent of any fractionating mineral (until biotite crystallizes in the rhyolite), it can be treated as a trace element.
All Geyser Bight samples diverge from the strong curvilinear path that is predicted.
Samples that lie on chords on the concave side of the model line may be partly explained by inter-trend mixing of basalt and silicic andesite.
Divergence from the predicted trend may also result from variations in K20 content of parent magmas and minor accumulation of matic minerals.
Samples that fall below the curve have anomalously high Al203 and may have selectively accumulated plagioclase.
Certainly the quartz and
The extreme disequilibrium of the mineral assemblage in this unit provides strong evidence of this mixing, Also shown in figure 7 are data from Okmok Volcano, whose magma is highly tholeiitic and probably not significantly affected by magma mixing (for example, Kay and others, 1982; Kay and Kay, 1985).
While the Olcmok Volcano data conform more closely to the calculated fractionation line, there is still considerable scatter.
For most Geyser Bight samples, magma mixing is probably not a dominant process for units other than the quartz andesite; it may be a common minor process.
CRYSTALACCUMULATION The possibility that differential accumulation of crystals within the host magmas modified the composition of those magmas is a concern when describing porphyritic magmas.
Indeed, piagioclase accumulation is probably a major factor in determinin g the final composition of lavas from Cinder Point (as discussed above).
Most scatter in Al203 for Mt. Recheshnoi samples can be explained by about 10 Percent plagioclase accumulation, an amount far less than the modal amount of plagioclase.
Selective crystal accumulation should primarily influence Al+3 and normative plagioclase because plagioclase dominates the modal mineralogy.
The lack of correlation between A203 or normative plagioclase and the percentage of phenocrysts in the rock indicates that crystal accumulation is not a major influence on magma composition.
CRUSTALMELTING While repeated transit of basaltic and andesitic magma through the arc crust might be expected to partially melt that crust, magmas that clearly owe their origin to this process are rare in the Aleutians.
One possible exception is the rhyolite from Russian Bay vaIley (Qr, sheet 1).
The prominent compositional gap between 63 and 76 percent Si@ indicates that this rhyolite is probably not derived from the acid andesites by fractional crystallization.
Instead, the rhyolite was probably produced by partial melting of the arc crust by heat provided by the more mafic magmas (see Smith and Leernan, 1987, for a discussion of a similar mechanism at Mt. St. Helens).
If rhyolite was produced over much of the lifetime of the volcano, there should be back-mixed dacites or

and
Such rocks are rare, the best example being the quartz and
This lack of back-mixed magmas suggests that rhyolite production was temporally restricted.

OTHEW PKOCESSES The high FeTi magmas cannot be related to other magmas by fractional crystallization, magma mixing, or crystal accumulation.
Their petrographic and gecchemical similarities to the tholeiitic series rocks described by Kay and others (1982) include high Fe0 and Ti*, high FeOWgO, and low crystal content.
Kay and others (1982) and Kay and Kay (1985) suggest that these rocks are the result of crystallization at low pressure, low water content, and high temperature.
The position of the cotectic that governs the evolution of these magmas, as deduced from experimental work, does not Seem to shift from that governing the evolution of other magmas (fig 8).
Thus, if the Kay and others (1982) explanation is correct, the magnitude of lowered pressure and/or water pressure is not sufficient to be reflected in normative mineralogy.
The origin of the high FeTi magmas remains enigmatic.
Variations in parental magma chemistry are expected, but with these data we cannot evaluate the magnitude of their effects.
Similarly, crustal assimilation may affect the final compositions of some magmas.
In fact, if the presence of rhyolite signals mobilization and eruption of partial crustal melts, then cxustal contamination is quite likely.
Recognition of crustal contamination requires additional data.
- 27 -
INFERENCES FOR DElTH OF FRACTIONATION Understanding the size, depth, and mean lifetime of crustal magma chambers is obviously important to understanding the geothermal energy of active volcanoes, but these aspects of magmatic evolution are among the most difficult to quantify.
Observations of the magnitude and direction of shifts of cotectics in multiply- saturated systems with changes in pressure and water pressure are made by equilibrating natural melts with their phenocryst assemblages in a laboratory at known PM and PH~O and measuring the composition of the equilibrium liquid.
There are abundant data for mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) at low pressure with no water.
Data on andesitic compositions at moderate Pm1 and P~20 are much less common, in part due to the difficulty of the experiments.
Available data are summsri zed in figure 8 on a projection onto normative diopside, silica, and plagioclase from within the tetrahedron diopside, silica, plagioclase and olivine.
The dry, 1 atm cotectic is given by the MORB data (see fig. 8 for references).
Additional anhydrous experiments at 8 kilobars (kb) and hydrous experiments at 2 and 5 kb are plotted.
The cotectic shifts towards plagioclase with increasing pressure and water pressure because both reduce the stability of plagioclase.
The 2 to 5 Kb "damp" co
All Geyser Bight data shift towards plagioclase and overlap the 2 and 5 Kb cotectics which indicates that most chemical evolution of Geyser Bight magmas, and thus most of their residence time in the crust, must have been at a minimum depth of 6 to 15 km.
If the magmas were anhydrous, that depth must be well over 25 km.
The presence of relict amphit

The Cinder Point samples plot much closer to the plagioclase apex than others, which probably reflects plagioclase accumulation rather than a deeper origin.
TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN MAGMA
COMPOSITION
Figure 9 shows a series of variation diagrams that illustrate the composition of Geyser Bight magmas as a function of age.
There are no major monotonic variations in chemistry over the 1.4 m.y. that lavas have erupted at Geyser Bight, but there are some minor trends that deserve comment.
Lavas from central Umnak Island show a very slight decrease in FeOL and CaO/Al+3, and, perhaps, MgO over time, and there is a very faint hint of concomitant increase in Si
These changes are very slight, marred by the eruption of some silicic magmas early in the history of the central Umnak Island vents; they could prove to be an artifact of the small number of analyses.
These apparent trends probably do not signal a slight increase in fractionation of a homogeneous magma batch because K20 contents of 800 ka lavas are not higher than those of 1100 ka lavas.
They do suggest that these temporal variations, if real, reflect variations in the composition of parental magmas, and in the amount of fractionation.
Chemical changes within the lifetime of Mt. Recheshnoi are more pronounced and are probably real.
Figure 9 shows that over much of the 0.5 m.y. lifetime of Mt. Recheshnoi, magmas have become more mafic, with a few notable exceptions.
Over this time, Si@ dropped from approximately 60 to approximately 53 percent and FeCY, MgO, CaO, and C!.aO/Al-
Ti% increased for about the first 200 ka and then decreased, while KzO remained steady for 200 ka and then decreased.

The lack of monotonic correlation t
It is impossible to quantify these processes withthedatainhand.
In addition, we do not have samples from the northwest, west, and southeast sides of the volcano.
The temporal changes of magma chemistry with time may well be more complicated than our data shows.
We do not have ages for a few basalt flows from the Geyser Creek valley that are p resumably at least a few hundred thousand years old and may fall off the perceived temporal trend.
These flows may represent the periodic influx of mafic magma into a quasi-steady system that is evolving toward more mafic average composition.
Periodic eruption of mafic magmas from steady-state systems has been observed elsewhere (for example, Nye and Turner, 1990) and is not unexpected.
Three exceptions to the trend towards more mafic compositions-with time-of Mt. Recheshnoi lavas are discussed below.
The first is the rhyolite, which erupted about 135 ka. Quenched and

conform to the overall temporal trend, especially if corrected for minor contamination of the basalt with rhyolite.
Secondly, the andesite flows from the east flank of the volcano (Qrf) are more silicic than the youngest lavas From the Mt. Recheshnoi central vent (57 percent compared to 52 percent Siti).
These flows contain inclusions of more mafic andesite, which indicates that the entire system is not moving towards more silicic compositions.
Note that the included blobs in the rhyolite and the young flank andesite are quenched magma within their host, as opposed to stoped conduit material or country rock.
The third exception is the felsic andesite clasta in young, valley-filling ash flows in Russian Bay valley (Qral).
The petrology and geochemistry of this unit are not well known.

EVOLUTION OF' THE MAGMATIC
SYSTEM
The magmatic system most relevant to understanding the Geyser Bight geothermal system is that of Mt. Recheshnoi.
The vents of central Umnak Island have been dormant for 500 to 750 ka, and any magma chambers that were associated with them are probably fully crystallized and near the temperature of the surrounding country rock.
Mt. Recheshnoi magmas have become more mafic with time, although some anomalously felsic magmas have erupted within the last 150 ka.
This evolutionary trend is unlike that of the few other Aleutian volcanoes for which we have abundant age and geochemical data.
Mt. Spurr steady-state andesite magmas remain nearly constant in composition for the 250
Early Mt. Wrangell lavas are mafic, but the lavas have remained nearly constant in composition over the last 500 ka (Nye and Turner, unpub. data).
Holocene Makushin magmas are on average more silicic than Pleistocene magmas, which are variable in composition.
Myers and others(1985) and Myers and Marsh(1987), based on studies of two separate volcanoes of different sixes, and thus presumed different ages, suggest that volcanoes may evolve from early calc-alkaline (presumably andesitic) compositions to late tholeiitic (more basaltic) compositions.
Mt. Recheshnoi may be an example of the volcano type Myers proposes, but the magnitude of the compositional shift is less than he anticipated.
Gne model for the evolution of the Mt. Recheshnoi magmatic system is discussed below.
As new magma intruded a reslatively ~001 crust early in Mt. Recheshnoi's history, the large thermal contrast resulted in significant fractionation and heat loss to the crust.
Successive batches of melt entered and passed through the crust, fractionating and loosing heat.
Through this process the crust heated to provide less thermal contrast, which decreased fractionation of subsequent batches of rising melt.
Successive magmas are less fractionated and more mafic, and ultimately, the crust heated to the point of partial fusion to produce the rhyolite.
Once the crust started to melt, it generated a silicic component that could be mixed with incoming basaltic magmaa to produce hybrid silicic magmas such as the most recent Mt. Recheshnoi's magma.
This m
It differs from that of Myers and others (1985) because it predicts increasing, rather than decreasing, chemical coupling with the crust.
THERMAL AREAS: DESCRIPTION, SPRING DISCHARGE, t LOCATION Six zones of thermal springs and small geyrers are dispersed over an area of about 4 km2 in the upper reaches of Geyser Creek valley at elevations that range from 30 m to 110 m (sheet 2, fig. 10).
Letters designate spring groups according to the nomenclature established by Byers and Brarmock (1949).
Previous investigations of the geothermal springs at Geyser Bight include Byers and Brarmock (1949), Ivan Barnes (1975 - U.S. Geological Survey, unpub. data, written commun., 1975; 1981), and Motyka and others (1981).
Most hot springs emanate along Geyser Creek and its tributaries and emerge in the valley floor and at the base of steep valley walls.
Two small areas of steaming ground and weakly pressurized fumaroles are located at elevations of 275 and 310 m in a tributary valley at the headwaters of Geyser Creek (Fl and F2, sheet 1).
During geologic field mapping (1988) a previously unreported fumarole field was discovered at approximately 450 m elevation on the lower northeast flank of Mt. Recheshnoi (P3, sheets 1 and 2).
The field is about 4 km south of Geyser Bight valley and is separated from the valley by a broad ridge.
The fumaroles lie near the head of a rugged canyon that drains towards Russian Bay.

SPRING DESCRIITIONS Geothermal activity at Geyser Bight (table 4) appears to vary over time; in 1980 there was substantially less output than either 1947 or 1988.
For the 1988 activity column in table 4, the following conventions are used.
Seeps (s) describes hot water quietly flowing from alluvium, colluvium, bedrock, or any combination thereof, at rates of 
Springs (sp) are larger flows than seeps.
Pools (p) are small, open bodies of water fed by a spring or by numerous indistinguishable seeps.
At ebullient boiling springs (eb), gas and steam violently break the surface.
Fountain (f) refers to springs in which, in addition to ebullition, hot water is ejected abve the normal surface of the water.
Using White's (1867) definition, a geyser (g) is a "hot spring characterized by intermittent discharge of water ejected turbulently and accomplished by a vapor phase."
Some authors believe ebullition and fountain@ are a type of geyser activity.
Some springs that were pulsing and almost continuous fountains in 1988 were described as geysers with 50 to 60 cycles per min in 1980 (Motyka and others, 1981).
Because the Geyser Bight geothermal area is relatively unknown, detailed descriptions of the thermal spring sites are provided for future reference.
Descriptions of activity refer to our period of observation (July 1988) unless otherwise stated.
SlTE Fl Fumarole field 1 (fig. 11) is located at approximately 300 m elevation in a slightly circular depression, mostly on the left bank of a creek informally referred to as Fumarole Creek.
Immediately above Fl, the temperature of Fumaro le Creek is 9.2"C.
In comparison to other local snow-fed creeks that have temperatures of 4Â°C the 9.2"C temperature of Fumarole Creek indicates that it has some geothermal heat input above Fl. Visual estimates of creek flow are 400 lpm above and 450 Ipm below Fl; the creek temperature below Fl is 195Â°C , The most prominent feature at Fl is a 100Â°C pressurized vent.
A slight odor of H2S is noticeable.
Adjacent to this vent is a 6 by 8 in m of altered hot ground with active steam vents and mud pots.
Fumarole field 2 (fig. 12) is located at approximately 275 m elevation and extends about 150 m along Fumarole Creek about l/2 km downstream from Fl. Fumarole Creek temperatures measure 17 `C above F2 and 21Â°C below P2.
Visual flow estimates are 450 lpm above F2 and 500 lpm below F2.
The most prominent feature at F2 is a 102'C preasuri zed vent.
F2 has low-chloride hot springs and mud pots and fumaroles.
A 20-m diam fossil fumarole field is located on the left bank of Fumarole Creek about 20 to 30 m below the last steam vent of F2.

Site G (fig, 14) is located 5.5 km from Geyser Bight at the southeastern end of the main glacial valley.
Two groups of thermal springs emerge at the base and on the lower slopes of the east valley wall.
Thermal waters emanate from numerous small pools, orifices, and seeps in the cemented alluvium and colluvium.
Several small steam vents also occur in the area.
Fossil geothermal areas, the hugest meamring 100 by 50 m, indicate that the geothermal activity was more extensive in the past or has migrated.
Several warm seeps and numerous sintercovered rocks are located in an old channel across the east fork of Geyser Creek, towards site J.

Spring Gl consists of several vents at the upstream edge of the larger pond.
Springs Glb, c, and e exhibit ebullient boiling and have fountains to 30 cm.

In 1988, spring Glc was pulsing almost continuously; in 1980 it erupted every 1 to 3 s. Gla WBS fountaining with occasional bursts of steam.
The pH of the thermal-spring waters at Gl ranges from 6.8 to 9.2 which reflects the boiling and loss of acid gases.

In a typical eruptive cycle, approximately 750 1 of water are discharged every 12 mm for an average minimum flow of 60 lpm.
The height of the fountaining was 60 cm in 1870 @all, 1870) and 1947; it decreased to 20 cm in 1988.
A 5-m-wide, 25m-long silica apron extends from the geyser towards the east fork of Geyser Creek.
Adjacent to spring G8 (fig. 16) is a 4-mdiam cluster of acid springs with pH values from 1.5 to 5.9.
Two springs are vigorously boiling, two are muddy, and all have low flows with a combined discharge of approximately 1.5 lpm.
These springs appear to result from condensation of steam and acid gases into and warming near-surface meteoric waters.
Springs G9, GlO, Gil, and a warm pool, Gi2, are located farther downstream (fig. 17).
Several vents also discharge directly into the east fork of Geyser Creek and along its banks.
The creek bottom has algal growth at least 50 m below the last seep.
Warm ground was found as far as 200 m downstream from G12.
Springs G9 and G10 are fountaining and have siliceous sinter cones and terraces, while spring Gil emanates from a cluster of boulders.
Water in pool G12 has a maximum temperature of 51Â°C but temperatures to 72Â°C were found in bottom sediments.
SITEH Site H springs (fig. 18) are located along the east fork of Geyser Creek and in a narrow tributary valley, elevation approximately 100 m.
The intensity of thermal activity at H has been irregular.
In 1947, Byers and Brannock (1949) reported seven springs with total output of approximately 2,000 lpm.
In 1980, Motyka and others (1981) reported eight springs, but total output was only 650 Ipm.
In 1988, six additional springs and numerous seeps were observed.
Several previously reported vents were dry, but total output was at least 1900 lpm in 1988.
The temperature of the east fork of Geyser Creek was 8.3"C above site H and 16.9"C below site H.

The uppermost springs and seeps emerge from volcanic bedrock that flanks vents are inaccessible because of cliffs, but their presence can h inferred by dark also discharge directly into the creek as evidenced by bubbling gas in a relatively the waterfall.
Temperatures (where measured) range from 40" to 80Â°C; flow was a 15-m waterfall (fig. 19).

Springs calm area between two stebs of 5 40 lpru
At the ba.se of the waterfall, a small creek (*H" Creek) enters the east fork of Geyser Creek from the south (fig. 19).
The most active H springs line the banks of this creek.
Above the highest visible seep, the temperature of "H" Creek is 16"C, which indicates that some hot water is seeping directly into the streambed abve the visibly active thermal zone.
At the mouth of "H" Creek, the temperature rises to 53'C from the addition of boiling water from the visible springs.
Except for H3 and HO, the other numbered springs along "H" creek exhibit ebullient boiling and fountaining.
Spring HI2 is immediately upstream from the mouth of "H" Creek along the east fork of Geyser Creek.
Two vents (flows 40 to 50 lpm each) and several smaller spouting vents comprise this spring group.
One larger vent discharges into a quiet ~1 and the other (H2) constantly bubbling with a lo-cm fountain.
Along "H" Cre
H3 and all other numbered springs along "H" Creek emanate from its west bank.
The largest and most active spring along "H' Creek is Hl, a set of three interco~ected, 1-mdiam cauldrons set within a lo-mdiam patch of large, mostly vokanic boulders up to 2-m diam.
The cauldrons contain vigorously boiling water with 70-cm fountains.
The 12-m-long channel that drains Hl contributes about one-third of the flow in `H" Creek.
Hl was a geyser with period of 2.5 to 3.9 mm in 1947, and a geyser with period of 1 min in 1980; it continuously fountained in 1988.
Ten meters upstream from Hl, spring HO emerges in a small, 1-mdiam bowl perched about 5 m above "H" Creek.
In 1980, this spring had a flow of 30 lpm, but by 1988 its flow had diminished to a trickle.

H10 has an algae-covered silica apron located about 20 m upstream from HO.
The principal spring has a 3O-cm fountain in a 6O-cmdiam bowl located about 5 m above "H" Creek.
Ten meters upstream, Hll emerges from the alluvium and colluvium.
Located in a 1-mdiam bowl about 4 m from the "H" Creek, this geyser fountains to 4.0 cm with irregular periods one to several minutes.
Although Hll is the last large springs along this creek, seeps with temperatures of 70" to 9O'C are found for another 20 m upstream.
About 100 m downstream from the mouth of "H" creek-along the east fork of Geyser Creek-is a previously unreported area of geothermal activity (fig. 20).
Along the north bank, for approximately 25-30 m, numerous seeps discharge 40" to 60Â°C water at 2 to 20 lpm.
Across the east fork of Geyser Creek (south side), II8 is normally a 1.3 by 0.5-m steaming pool of hot water with bubbling gas and no outflow.
However, in 1988 it erupted as a spectacular geyser with a 2-m fountain and water discharge of 2 100 Ipm for about 10 min.
Spring H9 emerges from colluvial cover about 15 to 20 m south of H8.
Its outflow enters a narrow, 4O- to 50-cm-wide channel, with several seeps and discharges into the east fork of Geyser Creek immediately upstream from H4.
H4 is a geyser of irregular period.
When first sampled in 1988, H4 boiled and fountained continuously to 40 cm while discharging about 400 lpm of water during the 5-hr observation.
Two days later, H4 was initially dry and then became active, geysering to 50 cm for 2 min before going dry.
Three minutes later, it geyser
Fountain height then decreased to 10 to 20 cm for 6 min before going dry again.
After 11 min, it geysered to 50 cm for 3 min before decreasing to 10 to 20 cm.
That fountain level lasted at least 30 min, until the end of the observation period.
The next day, H4 had a 4O-cm fountain and behaved as it had when first observed.

Downstream 20 to 25 m is the last concentration of site "H" springs.
A 10 by 15 m bare patch in lush vegetation marks the area where the H6 springs emerge from the cemented colluvium and glacial debris that covers the valley on the north side of the creek.
The main vent issues boiling water with a lo-cm fountain; a smaller vent (3 m away) is quiet with gas slowly rising to the surface.
On the south side, across from H6, are the two steaming pits called A and B in 1980.
Both are about 2 m diam with water level 1.5 m below the surface.
The level of the water oscillated 25 cm in 1980; in 1988 it did not.
Spring H7, about 5 m away, changed from an active geyser in 1980 to a quiet pool with gas slowly bubbling to the surface.
H5, a geyser in 1980, could not be found.
The temperatures of A, B, and H7 were within a degree of each other in 1980 and 1988, and are at or slightly above boiling.
Site J (fig. 21) is located in the southwest corner of Geyser Creek valley across from site G. Jl, the most prominent thermal spring at the site emanates from a 3-mdiam, 5-m-deep, funnel-shaped aquamarine pool set in valley alluvium.
A large silica apron extends east of the spring.
Byen and Brannock (1949) estimated 720 lpm discharge from the pooi in 1947, but by 1988 flow had decreased to 10 lpm.
Low, rumbling concussions could be heard and felt from beneath the ground surface around Jl.
The geometry, size, and temperature of the Jl pool suggest that Jl was a geyser that has become inactive or is presently a geyser whose eruptive cycle has not been observed.
Other springs and seeps at site J are dispersed over a distance of 250 m Plong the slope break at the base of a low ridge.
Above the currently active springs is a fossil hydrothermal area about 5,000 m* in size.

Gas occasionally breaks the surface of the calm pool.
An oblong pool 1 by 1.5 m at the head of a 20 by 20 m silica apron marks the location of geyser J5.
Every hour or so, gas and steam burst from the vent, and the water flow doubles to 50 lpm for about a minute.
The temperature at J5 was 9O"C, but may increase during geysering.

The irregular lower surface may be the bottom of an old pool.
We observed water between the two silica layers, The adjacent spring, J4, at 6O"C, is cooler than J5 but similar to it in pH, conductivity, flow rate, the form of the pool from which it emanates, and the presence of a silica apron.
A deep gurgling can be heard coming from beneath the surface around J4.
J3 (flow rate 10 lpm) is the last spring emerging from a pool.
52 is one of several seeps that lie 150 m farther along the slope break; temperatures decrease with distance.
Compared to other springs in Geyser Bight, site J is characterized by almost no algal growth.
As with Jl, the geometry and pool size of several of the other J springs suggest they may also have heen or are geysers whose activity has not been observed.
SlTEK Site K (fig. 22) is located 4.8 km inland from Geyser Bight near the valley center.
The springs flow directly from alluvium near the terminus of a large alluvial fan.
At Kl, 61 T water emerges in an oval 2.5-m-wide, 4-mlong and 4 1.5-m-deep pool, and flows down a narrow channel into two successively large oval pools covered with thick, dark algal growth.
The lower pooI, (spring K2) was 59Â°C and bubbling in 1980.
In 1988, K2 was a quiet 50Â°C ~1 clogged with algae.
Overflow (100 lpm in 1980; 30 lpm in 1988) from these pools and a fourth small, irregularly shaped pool with 40Â°C water spills into a nearby cold-water stream.

A second cold stream of similar size joins this stream 20 m downstream from the outflow of Kl and K2.
Spring K.3, on the small delta between these two streams, drains into the second stream.
K3's 30-cmdaim vent is hidden at the end of a 3-m-long, 0.7-m-wide, 1.25m
Numerous 50" to 70Â°C seeps emerge from the left bank of the second stream.
Stream water increases temperature from 12' to 18Â°C aa it passes through the seep ares.
Numerous small ponds 5 0.5 m diam with temperatures of 30" to 40Â°C are found between this creek and the channel that connects Kl and K2.
A slight cxlor of H2S is evident at site K.
SITEL Hot-spring site L lies almost directly across from site K, in an indentation on the northeast side of the valley
(fig. 23).
The concavity of the hollow in which the site is located and the warmth and muddiness of the soil in
and around the springs suggest the area is a small, shallow slump caused by warm-water injection.
Several small springs emerge around the upper back wall of the depression, and a few muddy seeps emerge at its center.
Numerous vents, 36" to 86Â°C discharge water directly into a l-m-deep, 20 by 7 m pool.
This pool supports abundant bacteria and algal flora.
Spring L3 has the greatest flow.
The most active site in 1980 was Ll; by 1988 this vent had cooled to 2.S'C with no water in its outflow channel.
Combined discharge from site L totaled 250 lpm.
The H2S odor is noticeable at least 100 m from the site, which has the strongest H2S odor in Geyser creek valley.

CONVECTIVE HEAT DISCHARGE BY SPRING FLOW The results of our 1988 thermal-spring-discharge measurements are shown in table 5.
For comparison, thermal-spring discharges measured by Motyka and others (1981) in 1980 are given in table 6 and those by Byers and Brannock (1949) in 1947 are shown in table 7.
Reported spring temperatures are the hottest treasured at the site.
The calculated heat discharged by spring flow (table 5) is referenced to the enthalpy of water at lO"C, the approximate average annu.aI temperature in the cehrral Aleutian Islands.
Because of problems with our flow meter, most 1988 discharges were visually estimated and may be subject to substantial error (25 - 50 percent); those sites that were measured by catchment or flow meter are noted in table 5.
The heat discharge by spring flow calculated for 1988 (16.7 MW) is much greater than for 1980 (6.1 MW), partly becam more springs were included in the 1988 calculations.
Variations in spring flow may also contribute.
Convective surface heat discharge, which was also estimated from stream-flow measurements made in 1981, is included in table 6.
Geyser Creek flow was measured below the point of input of thermal waters that drains from G and J (sheet 2).
Stream-water samples were collected at this site and from a site above H.
The hottest and most chemically concentrated thermal-spring waters at G (G8), J (J5), md H (H6) were taken to represent the undiluted thermal water that discharges into the stream drainage.
The average analyzed concentrations of Cl and B in these waters and in the stream waters above H and below G were used in mass-balance calculations to determine the hot-water fraction.
To calculate the convective heat discharge, we assumed the hot-water fraction

was at the surface boiling point.
The estimated 13.3 MW of discharged heat does not include contributions from spring groups K, L, and Q nor from any thermal waters that may enter the creek below the flow-measurement point.
When the heat discharge from spring groups K, L, and Q is subtracted from the 1988 estimates, the result, 15.1 Mw, compares reasonably well with the 1981 estimate of 13.3 MW determined by mass-balance calculations.
The 1988, 1981, and 1980 estimates are substantially lower than the heat discharge by spring flow calculated using 1947 estimates of spring flow (table 7) (Byers and Brannock, 1949).
Although Byers and Brannock (1949) do not report the method or precision of their measurements, the differences in flow rate-in some cases-appear too large to be explained by differences in me.asCng techniques; the variations in spring discharge appear to be real.
For example, flow-meter measurement of spring discharge at H7 was 135 lpm in 1988 and 70 lpm in 1980 vs. Byers and Brannock's (1949) report of 260 lpm in 1947; discharge from hot spring pool Jl was visually estimated at 10 lpm in 1988 vs. 760 lpm in 1947.
Geyser activity, particularly at H, was more subdued in 1980 than observed in 1988 or reported by Byers and Brannock (1949).
Silica sinter is being deposited at many boiling point vents and also forms large aprons in outflow channels.
Silica and other hydrothermal alteration deposits may periodically choke some spring and geyser conduits.
Periodic vent opening and increase in discharge could be triggered by seismic activity or build-up of steam pressure similar to that observed at Yellowstone National Park.

INTRODUCTION Reports of the Geyser Bight hot springs appear in Grewingk (1850) and Waring (1917), and their existence was probably known to Aleut villagers at Nikolski since ancient times.
Byers and Brannozk (1949) conducted an extensive survey of the thermal-spring areas during their reconnaissance geologic mapping of Umnak Island in 1946-48 and reported analyses on water samples from two springs.
Samples from four thermal springs were collected and analyzed by Ivan Barnes (written commun., U.S. Geological Survey, 1981) in 1975 as part of a U.S. Geological Survey reconnaissance investigation of hot-spring sites in the Aleutian arc.

In 1980, we rampled and analyzed seven Geyser Bight thermal springs and measur4 ping discharges during a regional assessment of geothermal resourcea in the Aleutian Islands for the State of Alaska wotyka and others, 1981).
These preliminary studies suggested that the hot springs are fed by multiple reservoirs with temperature ranges from 160' to 190Â°C.
The multiple reservoirs are related to a deeper parent reservoir with a temperature as high as 265Â°C.
In this fluid geochemistry study of the Geyser Bight geothermal area, waters from 14 thermal springs and numerous surf- waters were sampled and analyzed to more conclusively determine if multiple reservoirs exist and to determine the geochemical, isotopic, and temperature pammeters of ik3e reservoirs.
These data were also used to examine chemical equilibria, determine the source of water charging the reservoirs, and estimate heat loss by surface and near-surface thermal water discharge.
The results of this investigation confirm the existence of at least two chemically and isotopically distinct intermediate reservoirs with temperatures of 200" and 165Â°C.
Evidence for deep reservoirs at temperatures of 265" C and possibly 225" C also exists, but we are unsure if the

GAS CHEMISTRY Gas flows from steam fields Fl and F2 located at the head of Geyser Bight valley were too diffuse to obtain useable samples in 1980, 1981, and 1988.
Weather conditions and lack of time prevented sampling the highly pressurized fumaroles discovered in 1988 at F3.
Gas samples were obtained from thermal spring G6 in 1980 and from an acid spring adjacent to G8 in 1981 (table 8).
Both samples consist primarily of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, the latter reflecting air contamination during sample acquisition.
The N2/Ar ratios are nearly that of air, which indicates these constituents are probably primari ly atmospheric in origin, from surface air contamination, and from air dissolved in waters that charge the hydrothermal system.
Oxidation of H2S in near-surface groundwaters could account for the apparent depletion of this gas in the G6 sample; a nearby thermal pool has a pH of 3.6.
The carbon dioxide is probably of thermal and perhaps also of magmatic origin, as suggested by the helium isotope ratio.

The excess 3He is thought to be derived from the mantle (Craig and Lupton, 1981).
The 7.4 value is at the upper end of the range for helium isotope ratios for other thermal sites in the Aleutian arc of active volcanism (5.0 to 8.0) (Poreda, 1983) and is nearly the same as the 7.5 average for summit fumaroles in circum-Pacific volcanic arcs (Poreda and Craig, 1989).

FUZSULfTS
The results of geochemical analyses of the 1988 Geyser Bight thermal spring waters and representative stream waters are shown in tables 9 and 10, respectively.
Analyses from previous investigations are also included in these tables.
These include data from Byers and Brannock (1949); Ivan Barnes (written commun., U.S. Geological Survey, i981; Motyka and others, 1981) and previously unpublished data on DGGS stream samples collected in 1981.
Comparison of these data show thermal-water compositions did not change significantly from 1946 to 1988.
The slight variations in concentrations observed at resarnpled spring sites (for example, G8) can be attributed to slight differences in dilution ratios jr, for boiling springs, the degree of adiabatic boiling.
The thermal spring waters are all moderately concentrated Na-Cl waters rich in boron and arsenic.
COmSITIONAL TXENDS
For concentrations present in Geyser Bight thermal waters, Cl is considered chemically conservative.
Constituent
Constituent concentrations are also plotted against chloride in figures 25a-1 and figure 26.
Na, Li, B, and SO4 each plot along an approximately linear treud towards a dilute water end member.
In contrast, the data for several more reactive constituents (Siti, K, Cs, Rb, and F) exhibit two distinct trends; one for down-valley sites (G, J, K, and L), the other for site H. These correlations suggest that the waters are related to a common deep aquifer, but that during ascent to the surface they have partially or totally re-equilibrated to different temperatures and wall rocks in intermediate reservoirs.
The observed variations in concentrations that the emergent spring waters display along each of these trends can be explained by dilution or boiling.
A logical source of the dilution is meteoric water that infiltrates into the near-surface region beneath the springs.
Point A on the constituent-chloride graphs represents a water similar to stream samples unaffected by influx of thermal waters (table 10).

Distinct compositional mixing trends toward local cold stream waters are evident in plots of Ca, Mg, and Na and HC@, S04, and Cl (figs. 27a, b).
The inverse correlation observed between Mg and Cl (fig. 25e) is also indicative of dilution of thermal waters.
Because Mg is usually removed from high-temperature thermal waters through hydrothermal reactions, the presence of Mg in thermal waters is commonly a sign of cold-water mixing.
The constituent-chloride plots for Ca and HCQ are more scattered, although they ti appear inversely correlated with Cl (figs. 25d, f).
Spring waters at or above the boiling p
The higher pH exhibited by the boiling springs is probably also due to the loss of CR and other acid gases to the volatile phase that separates from the boiling water.
Acid-sulphate springs that emanate near Spring G8 corrol~rate to this conclusion.
Ca and HCQ in the boiling spring waters could also have been removed by precipitation of calcite because these waters are all near saturation with respect to calcite.
The Rb/Cl and WC1 ratios for sites H and Q are lower than those for down-valley sites (figs. 2..5h, i) but the Rb/Cs ratios are similar (table ll), ranging from 0.45 to 0.68.
Cs can be removed from thermal waters at temperatures less than about 2OO'C by analcime and other xeolites (Goguel, 1983; Keith and others, 1983).
Thus, the difference in 
Cs concentrations and Cs/Cl ratios for Geyser Bight thermal waters are similar to those found for thermal waters from Upper and Lower Geyser Basins at Yellowstone National Park (Keith and others, 1983).
Keith and others (1983) suggested that the Cs/Cl ratio may be useful in dete r-mining the host rock of the hydrothermal system.
The Cs/Cl ratios for the Geyser Bight thermal waters are similar to data Keith and others (1983) selected as representing equilibration within rhyolitic rock.
Rhyolite is rare in the Aleutians.
Based on Geyser Creek valley geology (sheet l), rhyolitic reservoir rocks are not expected at Geyser Bight.
The presence of a linear zone of 135 ka rhyolite domes about 4 km southwest of site H and 1.5 km southwest of fumarole F3, however, indicates that conditions appropriate for rhyolite generation existed in the recent past.
Such conditions could exist today, although there is no evidence of a rhyolitic component in the youngest lavas erupted from Mt. Recheshnoi (seep.
28).
ARSENICANDBORON As and B in Geyser Bight thermal waters deserve specific attention because concentrations of these constituents and particularly their ratios to Cl appear anomalously high when compared to other geothermal areas.
Concentrations of both constituents increase linearly with Cl at Geyser Bight (figs. 25g, j).

Although concentration of As in the Geyser Bight thermal-spring waters (6.6 ppm) is similar to that found in geothermal well waters at the Makushin geothermal area on neighboring Unalaska Island (10 ppm) (Motyka and others, 1988), the As/Cl ratio at Geyser Bight is three times greater than at Makushin.
Few of the volcanically hosted hydrothermal systems for which data are available have As concentrations as high as at Geyser Bight or Makushin (compare Stauffer and Thompson, 1984).
With one exception, the As/Cl ratio for the Geyser Bight waters (0.01) is greater than that reported for other geothermal systems.
For example, the As/Cl ratio for Yellowstone thermal waters ranges from 0.003 to 0.005 (Stauffer and Thompson, 1984), while thermal springs at Lass-en have As/Cl ratios of 0.005, except one spring that has a As/Cl ratio of 0.01 (Thompson and others, 1985).
A principal source of As in geothermal waters appears to be leaching of reservoir rocks.
Arsenic occurs in minor to trace amounts in most rocks and averages ahut 0.5 ppm in the Geyser Bight pluton.
Stauffer and Thompson (1984) concluded that at least 30 to 50 per cent of the As in the Yellowstone hot spring waters was derived by rock leaching.
However, rock-water interaction appears insufficient to entirely explain elevated As concentrations found at Yellowstone, Lassen, and some other volcanically hosted hydrothermal systems (Stauffer and Thompson, 1984; Thompson and others, 1985).
Although a magmatic source for As in geothermal systems remains unproven, it seems a likely candidate for explaining elevated As concentrations in these cases and perhaps for Geyser Bight.
Boron concentrations at Geyser Bight are also similar the B/Cl ratio is substantially higher, over an order of (0.8 vs. 0.02).
Although B concentrations in geothermal the Ngawha system in New Zealand, the B concentrations to the Makushin geothermal area (60 ppm).
However, magnitude greater at Geyser Bight than at Makushin waters are quite variable, ranging up to 1,000 ppm for and B/Cl ratios observed at Geyser Bight are similar to

or higher than those found at most other geothermal systems.
Elevated concentrations of B in some systems have been attributed to leaching of sedimentary formations (Stauffer and Thompson, 1984; Thompson, 1985).
Although Byers (1959) reported albitized shales and sandstones in the vicinity of Geyser Bight, detailed geologic mapping did not uncover any unquivccally sedimentary units in the Geyser Bight ares.
Boron concentration in the Geyser Bight pluton, the presumed reservoir rock, is only 7.5 ppm.
In comparison, shales have an average concentration of 100 ppm (Krauskopf, 1979).
Shales and sandstones exposed elsewhere on Umnak Island may still underlie the area, but are not exposed.
If so, hydrothermal fluids that circulate through such r
Alternatively, the excess B may have been derived directly from a degassing magmatic heat source.
B has been shown to be selectively adsorbed on clay particles during circulation through both near-shore and deep-sea pelagic sediments (Palmer and others, 1985).
Boron, along with other volatile elements, would have been expelled from any subducted pelagic sediments and incorporated into magma rising from the region above the subducted slab into the shallow crustal regions.
STABLE ISOTOPES Results of stable isotope analyses of Geyser Bight meteoric and thermal waters are given in table 12 and plotted in figures 28a and b.
Two meteoric water lines are included: the first is the meteoric water line of Craig (1961), which is based on analyses of worldwide precipitation; the second is the Aleutian-Adak meteoric water line (A-ML) (Motyka and others, in prep.).
The latter was derived from a combination of stable isotope values for 57 Adak weather station precipitation samples [data obtained from the International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna (IAEAV)] and for 52 stream and precipitation samples obtained from various Aleutian Islands.
Craig's meteoric water line is slightly steeper in slope than the A-AhJWL, and the two lines intersect at 6D = -73 per mil and 6180 = -10.3 per mil.

Stream waters generally follow the well-known altitude effect associated with precipitation (see, for example, Gat, 1980), with streams at higher elevations correlating with lighter isotopic values.
Examples of this effect are samples F
The isotope values for all Geyser Bight thermal-spring waters plot to the right of the meteoric water lines, and the different spring groups have distinct isotopic signatures (fig. 28).
Deuterium values for sites H, K, L, and Q are similar to or slightly heavier than the calculated average for 
In contrast to AD, @O values for all thermal springs are positively shifted with respect to local stream waters, with the degree of shift correlating with Cl concentration.
The greatest shift occurs for sites G and J, which are 2 to 2.5 per mil heavier than the calculated average for local stream waters.
Near-boiling, low Cl acid springs occur at site G and have much heavier isotopic values then the surrounding high-chloride springs (table 12).
These acid springs, which exhibit little flow, are probably surface and shallow ground waters that are heated by condensing steam and acid gases derived from the waters feeding the nearby high-Cl, near-neutral thermal springs.
Their isotopic values are probably a result of continuous evaporative -63 -

However, a deep water composition (as determined from a well fluid) is required as a starting point for the treatment of the data, and no such analysis is available for Geyser Bight.
By using isotope values for site G waters as an end point, a range of starting point values can nevertheless be estimated.
Changes in 6D and 6*sG in the residual liquid as a water boils are a function of 
Using data from Truesdell and others (1977), figure 29a illustrates the change in composition a thermal water would undergo as it ascends from a reservoir to emerge boiling at the surface with a 6D value and Cl concentration similar to site G thermal-spring waters.
The paths correspond to two extreme cases: (a) SS, single-stage steam separation, and (b) C, continuous steam separation.
The beginning point temperatures used in the analysis correspond to geothermometer estimates of reservoir temperatures discussed later.
The estimated range of 6D reservoir values lies within the range of values for I
Similar correlations between deuterium of geothermal waters and local meteoric waters have led many investigators to conclude that geothermal systems are mainly recharged by local precipitation (see Truesdell and Hulston, 1980, for review) and such is probably the case for the Geyser Bight geothermal area.
A similar analysis for site H resulted in slightly lighter 6D reservoir values compared to G, which suggests that the zone of recharge for the reservoir feeding the H system lies at a higher elevation than that for the G/J reservoir.
Applying similar techniques to 6l*O vs. Cl gives "reservoir" values of al80 that are 0.6 to 1.0 per r
The isotope boiling paths roughly parallel the meteoric water lines so that the apparent lgO shift with respect to these lines remains at 2 to 2.5 per mil.
Similar shifts in the 180 content of geothermal waters to more positive values with respect to kal meteoric waters have been observed in most hightemperature geothermal systems, These positive shifts have been attributed to tsO exchange between the deeply circulating meteoric waters and reservoir wallrocks with the degree of shift depending on temperature and rock/water ratio (Truesdell and Hulston, 1980).
Comparable shifts in 6D do not take place because reservoir rocks contain little deuterium.
Nearly all H springs and many G springs are vigorousiy boiling at the surface.
In addition, these and the other springs may also have been diluted.
Using techniques de-scribed by Truesdell and others (1977), the effects of mixing and boiling can IX analyzed.
Figure 29b illustrates the case for site H spring waters.
Here, Ml is a mixing line behveen a hypothetical meteoric water with a temperature of 10Â°C, Cl concentration of 10 ppm, and 6D value of -70 per mil and an ascending thermal water with T = 165"C, Cl = 490 ppm, and 6D = -74 per mil. SS and C show compositions of waters that ascend to the surface without mixing and emerge as boiling spring waters for the cases of single-stage and continuous steam separation, respectively.
SSm and Cm show the surface compositions of the residuaI liquid phase of waters that mix at depth along M' and then ascend to the surface for the cases of single-stage and continuous steam separation, respectively.
This model adequately accounts for the 6D and Cl compositions of spring Q and H springs sampled in 1988.
l3oth 1980 H samples are heavier in 6D than the 1988 sample.s, which suggests that the diluting water may have had a different composition in 1980.
A similar analysis performed for G, J, K and L spring waters is illustrated in figure 29c.
The value chosen for the reservoir water (6D = -72 per mil, Cl = 520 ppm) lies between the single-stage and continuous steam separation values determined for the case of a 200Â°C reservoir (fig. 29a).
Ml is a mixing line between this deep thermal water and a hypothetical cold water (SD = -71 per mil, .Ci = 10 ppm).
Mz illustrates a mixing line between the cold water and shallow thermal waters whose composition is similar to site G boiling spring waters.
This model suggests that the compositions of site G boiling spring waters are adequately explained as the result of a steam separation process intermediate between single-stage and continuous without mixing with cold waters.
Other springs in the area are below boiling.
The isotopic values for some of these spring waters appear to be the result of mixing fractionated thermal waters, similar to site G boiling water, with meteoric waters along M2 rather than by mixing meteoric waters with the deep thermal water along Ml, followed by boiling to the surface (SSm and cm).
Data points for other down-valley, lower-temperature, and comparatively more dilute springs cannot be explained by this m

Reviews of tritium in atz
Tritium occurs in atmospheric waters as a result of both natural and manmade processes.
It is produced naturally by the interaction of cosmic radiation with the upper atmosphere.
Enormous amounts of manmade tritium were released into the atmosphere during the period of thermonuclear testing from 1952 to 1962.
Although pre-1952 data are sparse, natural tritium levels in precipitation appear to range from abut 4 to 25 tritium units (TU), depending on location (Gat, 1980), with an average of about 10 TIJ in temperate zone, continental meteoric waters (Panichi and Gonfiantini, 1978).
Average tritium concentrations in precipitation fluctuated widely following thermonuclear tests, reaching peak levels of over 2,200 TIJ in the northern hemisphere in the late spring of 1963 (Gat, 1980).
Reported tritium concentration in precipitation at Adak Island for June 1963 averaged 3,900 TU (data from IAEAV).

Since 1963, atmospheric concentrations of tritium have steadily declined through radioactive decay and precipitation of tritiated tropospheric waters, and average concentrations are beginning to approach pre-1952 levels.
Tritium concentrations in precipitation undergo seasonal variations that are linked to exchanges between the stratosphere and the troposphere (Gat, 1980).
Maximum concentrations occur in late spring followed by a minimum in late fall.
As an example, in Anchorage in 1980 (the most recent year for which data are available), the weighted annual average tritium concentration dropped to 29 TU, with a seasonal variation that ranged from a winter minimum of 16 `IV to a late-spring maximum of 51 TU.
Because of its relatively short half-life (12.3 yr), tritium is a good indicator of meteoric waters of relatively young age and has therefore been extensively used to estimate age and mixing of waters in groundwater and geothermal systems (see Fontes, 1980, and Panichi and Gonfiantini, 1978 for reviews).
At Geyser Bight, tritium concentrations in G8 thermal-spring waters are below detection (
In comparison, thermalspring waters from H6 have a tritium concentration of 2.4 to 2.9 TU, onequarter to one-half that of local stream water.
Because of the surprisingly high concentration of tritium in H6 waters, a repeat analysis was performed with nearly identical results.
Interpretation of the elevate-d tritium concentration in the H6 waters remains ambiguous.
The H6 tritium concentration could reflect mixing of meteoric waters of very recent age, but analyses of water chemistry and stable isotope data do not support a 25 to 50 percent admixture of near-surface meteoric waters in the H6 thermal spring waters.
An alternate possibility is that recharge of the site H geothermal reservoir system is considerably more rapid than at site G.
A 1950 water with an initial tritium concentration of 10 TU would have decayed to - 67 -
about 2.5 TU by 1988.
Another possibility is that small amounts of meteoric waters associated with periods of thermonuclear testing are intercepting and slightly diluting ascending thermal waters at deep levels.
Northern hemisphere precipitation in 1954, with a peak tritium concentration of about SW TU (Gat, 1980), would have decayed to concentrations of about 130 TU in 1988.
GEOTHERMOMETRY SILICA Results of applying the silica geothermometer (Foumier and Potter, 1982) to Geyser Bight hot-spring waters are given in table 14.
Silica concentrations are plotted against vent enthalpy in figure 30, along with the quartz solubility curve.
For pressures normally encountered in geothermal systems, silica concentrations in geothermal waters are a function of temperature, pH, and the controlling silica mineral phase.

Following the method of Foumier and Potter (1982), rays originating from a point representing separated steam at 1 atm pressure with an enthalpy of 2676 J/g and less than 1 ppm silica are drawn to points representing lkling springs Gl and H6.
Intersection of these lines with the quartz solubility curve (A and D, respectively) marks the enthalpy and silica concentration of the parent water for the case of adiabatic cooling and single-stage steam separation at the surface.
As this water ascends and cools adiabatically , boiling concentrates silica in the residual liquid phase.
The case of continuous steam separation would provide slightly higher temperature estimates.
Foumier and Potter's (1982) quartz geothermometers are based on neutral or near-neutral solutions.
For a pH greater than 7.5, the solubility of quartz increases with increasing pH and is most pronounced for temperatures between 100" and 250Â°C (Fournier, 1981).
However, pH values of solutions in high-temperature geothermal reservoirs are likely to be below 7.5 because of the buffering of hydrogen ions by silicate hydrolysis reactions.
The high pH values for some Geyser Bight hot-spring waters probably result from the loss of C@ and H2S as the water boils after leaving the high-temperature reservoir.
Following the recommendation of Fournier (1981) for this situation, the silica concentration of the hot-spring water is assumed to reflect near-neutral pH reservoir conditions; no correction was applied to the observed silica concentration.

The silica geothermometer is based on absolute concentration, and subsurface dilution of ascending thermal water by cooler low-silica water can result in underestimating reservoir temperature.
Dilution probably accounts for the lower temperatures predicted by the quartz geothermometer for non-boiling springs at sites G, K, L, and Q. Solutions initially above 200Â°C can also become supersaturated with respect to amorphous silica, and precipitation can take place as the waters ascend and cool adiabatically.
The loas of dissolved silica in such a hotspring water would also cause the quartz geothetmometer to underestimate reservoir temperature.
Site G boiling spring waters and site J waters have similar concentrations of Cl and Na, indicative of little or no dilution, but have varying Sia concentrations, evidence that silica was lost from these waters by precipitation or reequilibration (fig. 25a, m).
In contrast, hot-spring waters of group H show marked linearity between both Si@ and Cl and Na and Cl (figs. 25a, 26).
Here, dilution rather than precipitation appears to have affected the silica concentrations of some of the H site boiling hot-spring waters.
Using the results of the most concentrated spring waters, the minimum reservoir temperatures predicted by the quartz geothermometer are 200Â°C for groups G and J, and 165'C for H. CATION Three cation geothermometers were applied to the Geyser Bight hot-spring waters (table 14).
Because these geothermometers are based on ratios of constituents rather than on absolute concentrations, they are less susceptible to dilution.
Temperatures predicted by the Na-K geothermometer of Foumier (1981) are in excellent agreement with temperatures predicted by the quartz geothermometer for spring waters with the highest silica concentrations.
The Na-K-Ca geothermometer (Foumier and Truesdell, 1973) gives lower temperatures than the Foumier Na-K geothermometer, with the difference ranging up to 20Â°C.
In contrast, the Na-K geothermometer of Giggenbach (1988) predicts temperatures 15" to 20Â°C higher than the Fournier Na-K geothermometer.
The Na-K-Ca geothermometer was empirically derived specifically to deal with calcium-rich waters, particularly low-temperature thermal waters, because application of the NP-K geothermometer to such waters gave anomalously high calculated temperatures (Foumier and Truesdell, 1973).
Calcium concentrations are generally low in all Geyser Bight hot-spring waters, and calcium enrichment in Geyser Bight hot-spring waters appears to correlate with spring waters that are below boiling and considered to be of mixed origin.
This correlation suggests the C-a enrichment may in part be associated with the dilution process.
In addition, for the boiling springs, calcite was also found to be near saturation, which suggests that CaC@ may have precipitated from these waters during their ascent.
Such loss of Ca would affect the reliability of the Na-K-Ca geothermometer.
For thermal waters thought to be derived from high-temperature environments, the Na-K method generally gives excellent results (Foumier, 1981) and is preferable for Geyser Bight.
Using Fournier's Na-K geothermometer, reservoir temperatures of 190" to 194'C are estimated for site G and J thermal waters and 160" to 165Â°C for site H thermal waters, In contrast, the Na-K-Ca geothexmometer gives 175" to 186Â°C for sites G and J and 150' to 152Â°C for site H.
The Na-K geothermometers of Foumier (1981) and Giggenbach (1988) are based wide range of deep welI discharges.
The steeper temperature dependence of geothermometer is due to his selection of data points that represent only maximum temperature (Giggenbach, 1988).
The latter approach assumes that maximum NaiK ratios of full equilibration.
SULFATE - WATER OXYGEN ISOTOPE The results of applying the sulfate-water oxygen isotope geothexmometer to the Geyser Bight hot springs are given in table 15.
The data include results for a sample obtained by Ivan Barnes (U.S. Geological Surveys written commun., 1975) three samples we obtained in 1980, and two samples we collected in 1988.
The data for spring G8 are the easiest b interpret because the lack of tritium in Spring G8 waters rules out mixing of young meteoric waters.
G
Spring G8 is a boiling-point geyser, and the presence of warm ground and acid springs nearby indicate that steam separation from the spring conduit is intermediate between single-stage and continuous.

Geothermometer temperatures computed using formulas and tables l?orn McKenzie and Truerrdell(l977): Tl = conductive cooling, X! = single stage steQm removal, T3 = continuous steam removal.
All 6180S04 and 6180-H20 of spring G8 (1975) analyzed by N.L. Nebring and C.J. Janik, U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park.
Remaining 6180-H20 analyzed by Stable Isotope Laboratory, Southern Methodist University.
6180 in per mil WRT SMOW.
Following the recommendation of McKenzie and Truesdeli (1977). the appropriate range for the reservoir temperature in 263O to 282OC.
Spring Jl is a large, open, hot pool whoa water is geochemically very similar to G8 water.
Compared to G8, Jl has the same 6180 value for dissolved sulfate, but is slightly heavier in 6180 for H20.
As discussed previously, the slightly heavier isotopic composition could be attributed to evaporative concentration.
Because Jl is below the boiling point, the conductive cooling temperature, Tl, would ordinarily be chosen as the SO4-H2O geothemiometer estimate.
However, this temperature for Jl seems excessively high when compared to that found for G8.
As at G8, warnt marshy ground near the J springs suggests that steam may be separating from the spring conduit at depth.
There is the intriguing possibility that Jl is a geyser with a relatively long period.
Chloride concentration of Jl is slightly lower than G8, which suggests that a small amount of cold water may be diluting the thermal water and quenching residual boiling below the pool.
If 60, the range 265' to 287'C, given by T2 and T3, is more applicable.
These latter temperatures are in much better agreement with G8 results.
Spring L3 is below the boiling point and has a chloride concentration substantially below that of G8.
As discussed previously, based on similarities of constituent/chloride ratios, L3 is probably a diluted version of G-type water.
Examination of Na vs. Cl (fig. 25s) suggests mixing of about 35 percent cold meteoric water with G8-type water to produce L3 water.
No boiling springs, acid or otherwise, occur near L3, and it is likely that boiling of the ascending deep thermal water is completely quenched by near-surface mixing of cold meteoric water.
Dilution complicates interpretation of the L3 SO4-H2O geothermometer because the near-surface mixing of meteoric water obkzure3 the calculation of the 6180 value of the deep thermal water.
Surface stream waters saqkl near spring groups K and L in 1988 had al80 values of -9.6 and -10 per mil, while the average for all stream-water samples was -10.2 per mil.
These values are 1.5 to 2 per mil lighter than 6180-H20 valuea for the most concentrated spring waters at Geyser Bight.
Dilution of deep thermal water with me
The Tl conductive SO4-H2O -71-
geothermometer for the L3 spring water A**0 value therefore provides only a minimum estimate for the deep thermal-water temperature.
This estimate of 262Â°C compares well with the lower range of G8 and Jl estimates.
Results of isotopic analysis of the two H springs samples are consistent with each other (table 15).
Compared to G and J spring waters, the #*O values for dissolved sulfate are abut 2 per mil heavier, although the 6180 whx.s for these H spring waters are similar.
The difference in isotope values for dissolved sulfate is probably not attributable to formation of sulfate by oxidation of H2S at low temperatures.
No odor of H2S was detected at site H, and hot-spring waters analyzed from site H have nearly identical SO4/Cl ratios (fig. 25k), which indicates that oxidation of H2S is probably unimportant (McKenzie and Truesdell, 1977).
We suggest two possibilities to explain the differences in 6180 values for dissolved sulfate: 1) there are two deep reservoirs with different temperatures; or 2) 6l*O-SO4 partially re-equilibrates while the waters reside in lower temperature reservoirs at intermediate depth.
Tritium analyses indicated the presence of young meteoric water in the H spring system, but the data were insufficient to determine the amount of mixing or whether mixing was responsible for the high tritium value.
As with spring L3, any addition of near-surface meteoric water to ascending thermal water would tend to produce a spring water with Al80 values lighter than the thermal water.
The temperature.~ predicted by the SO4-H2O geothermometer for the H springs are therefore minimum estimates.
Because both H springs sampled are at boiling, the applicable temperature range is 221' to 232Â°C.
ASSESSMENT OF GEOTFIERMOMETERS
&
All or none of these conditions may actually be met in real systems.
In reviewing the Geyser Bight geothermometers, we find that the temperatures predicted by two traditionally used geothermometers, that is, the quartz geothennometer and the Na-K cation of Foumier, are in excellent agreement with each other for the Geyser Bight hot-spring waters that have the highest concentrations of dissolved solids, for example, Gl, G8, Jl, H6, and H4, and probably represent minimum estimates of temperatures for subsurface aquifers.
For springs that issue below boiling point at sites G, J, K, and L, the Fotier Na-K temperature exceeds the quartz conductive geothermometer by several to tens of degrees Celsius.
Be
Mixing at H is not as clearly indicated by comparison of Na-K and quartz geothermometers.
Results for the most concentrated springs H6 and H4 show that the Na-K temperature is identical or slightly lower than the quartz adiabatic temperature.
For the more dilute springs suspected to be of mixed origin (Hl, H2, and H7), the Na-K temperature is similar to or slightly higher than the quartz temperature.
For the pH and temperature range of most deep geothermal waters, the rates of the sulfate oxygen isotope exchange reaction are very slow compared to silica solubility and cation exchange reactions (Foumier, 1981; Truesdell and Hulston, 1980).
Once equilibrium is attained in the deep reservoir, there is little t-e-equilibration of the oxygen isotopes of sulfate as the water cools during movement to the surface, unless that movement is very slow.
Therefore, temperatures predicted by the SO4-H2O oxygen isotope geothermometers, which are substantially higher than the cation and silica temperatures, may reflect temperatures in deep reservoirs at Geyser Bight.
Assuming that this is the case at Geyser Bight, geothermometry suggests that thermal waters initially reside in deep reservoirs with a minimum temperature of 265Â°C.
Thermal water from these deep reservoirs ascends to reservoirs at intermediate depths where cations and silica re-equilibrate to temperatures of 2OO*C for waters emerging at sites G and J and other down-valley sites and to temperatures of 165'C for waters emerging at site H and perhaps site Q. Residence time in these intermediate reservoirs must be on the order of several months or more to achieve new cation equilibrium.
Residence and travel time for site H waters may have been sufficiently long for partial re-equihbration of the sulfate oxygen isotopes.

CHEMICALEQUILXBRIA Proper evaluation of chemical equilibrium in subsurface aquifers requires information on dissolved constituents, gas partial pressures (C
Such information, which is normalIy obtained from a well, is lacking for Geyser Bight, and aquifer conditions must be inferred from available surface thermal-spring chemistry.
Aquifer chemical composition can be estimated by adjusting for the concentration of constituents caused by boiling, but lack of information on the volatile phasea and on the pomibility that calcite has precipitated hinder accurate calculation of aquifer pH and aquifer Ca concentration, parameters that are critical in evaluating mineral stabilitiee.
Nevertheless, with reasonable assumptions, some reservoir fluid-mineral equilibria can be estimated.
An activity diagram showing the principal phase-s in the system Na2O-K+-A@.-H20 at 200Â°C is shown in figure 31.
Stability fields for albite, potassium feldspar (K-feldspar), and muscovite (?Z-mica) at 150Â°C are also shown for comparison.
Log activities for Geyser Bight waters calculated using 1988 thermal-spring chemistry show that the most concentrated waters from sites G an$ J are in equilibrium with both albite and potassium feldspar.
The more dilute springs plot OR or near the extension of the albite-potassium feldspar equilibrium line into the field of muscovite stability.
In contrast, site H thermal-spring waters plot closer to the 150Â°C equilibrium line.
Points G8-B and H6-B, which illustrate the effects of adjusting concentrations but not pH for steam losses, are only slightly displaced on the albite-potassium feldspar equilibrium line.
The effect of decreasing pH to more realistically reflect probable aquifer conditions is to displace points G8-B and HG-B further toward muscovite stability.
Calculated pH at the albite-potassium feldspar-muscovite 200Â°C triple point is 7.2.

It is readily apparent in the trilateral plot of Na-K7/Mg shown in figure 32a that thermal waters at site H vs. the down-valley sites have equilibrated at different temperatures.
This diagram and its application to geothermal systems are described by Giggenbach (1988).
The "full-equilibrium" curve in figure 32a represents compositions of waters in full equilibrium with the mineral system albite-potassium feldspar-muscovite-clinochlore-silica at the temperatures indicated.
The boundary between partially equilibrated and immature waters shown in figure 32a is somewhat arbitrary and serves only as a rough guideline (Giggenbach, 1988).
The isotherms correspond to the quilibrium equations Lh = log (c
Magnesium favoring depletion commonly present or up respectively, concentrations in thermal waters are highly temperature dependent, with hotter temperatures of Mg from the water through hydrothermal reactions.
For more mature thermal waters, Mg is in only trace quantities.
The effect of increasing or decreasing Mg is to move the points down parallel to the K-Na isotherms.
from group H plot on or near the 180Â°C isotherm, while those from groups 200" and 210Â°C isotherms.
The K-Mg system adjusts to cooling temperature and spring waters that plot below the "immatme water" line probably reflect environment as the waters cool conductively or, more likely, cool by mixing (2)
In figure 32a the spring waters G, J, L and K lie on or between the more rapidly than the K-Na system, the dissolution of Mg in the shallow with colder ground waters.
Giggenbach (1988) also devised a C
Equation (2) is used to correlate C@ fugacities with their likely equilibration reference temperatures because K and Mg are more likely to equilibrate at similar rates and under similar conditions as the K-Ca-geobarometer.
Giggenbach's graphical representation of this geobarometer based on end-member mineral phases assumed to control 61% fugacities in geothermal systems is reproduced in figure 32b with data points for Geyser Bight geothermal area thermal springs superimpod.
Based on data from explored systems, Giggenbach (1988) concluded that the geobarometer is only reliable for data points close to the full equilibrium line; those that plot above this line probably come from a rock-dominated, C
Using this criteria, site G waters appear the most suitable for application of this geobarometer.
Assuming equilibrium with calcite, the graphically predicted f(CQ2) is about 0.1 bar for Gl and GS waters.
The f(C@) corresponding to equilibrium with calcite at the predicted Na-K and quartz geothermometer temperature of 200Â°C suggested by the equilibrium curve is about 1.0 bar.
Assuming these values for f(C@) and assuming that calcite is at saturation at the predicted geothermometer reservoir temperature of 2OCPC, an estimate of reservoir pH can be made by using the reaction (Henley and others, 1984): CaCQj + 2H+ = Ca++ + Hz0 + C@ (4)
The calculated pH range of 6.1 to 6.6 compares well with pH values found in wells at explored geothermal systems; for example, the Makushin geothermal system on neighboring Unalaska Island has a reservoir pH of about 6.1 (Motyka and others, 1988).
Figures 33a and b are SiC+Ca activity diagrams at 200Â°C for various zeolites and clays with Makushin water plotted for comparison.
The range for Geyser Bight water was plotted using the reservoir pH estimated from site G water and spring GS Ca concentration adjusted for boiling.
The low end of the pH range suggests that the reservoir fluid is in equilibrium with prehnite, laumontite, and kaolinite.

MODEL OF HYDRO THERMAL SYSTEM CHLORIDE-ENTHALPYANALYSIS Thermal water that ascends from a deep reservoir may cool by boiling, by conduction of heat to surrounding rock, by dilution with colder waters, or by a combination of these pn
During ascent, its chemical and isotopic composition can be affected by water-rock reactions, re-equilibration, precipitation, mixing, and boiling.
The emergent hot-spring waters can, and commonly do, have compositions and enthalpie-s significantly different From the original parent thermal water.
Despite these complexities, chemical compositions of hot-spring waters can still be useful for deriving information on underground conditions.
Cl-enthalpy and Sia-chloride diagrams, when used in conjunction with other evidence, are particularly useful for tracing the origins of spring waters compositions and for determining underground temperatures, salinities, and boiling and mixing relationships.
Figure 34 shows Cl concentrations of sampled Geyser Bight hot-spring waters plotted as a function of enthalpy at the measured vent temperature.
In our analyses, we seek consistency between these diagrams and 1) geochemical and isotopic compositions; 2) Si
Truesdell and others (1977) calculated the maximum rates of maas flow for conductive cooling without boiling and the minimum rates of mass flow for adiabatic cooling with negligible conductive cooling for water moving vertically from different initial depths.
Waters were assumed to start at 200Â°C and emerge at 100Â°C.
Conduits were assumed to 
The results of these calculations, some of which are shown in table 16, are particularly useful for our assessment of the Geyser Bight hydrothermal system because geothermometry and chemical equilibria indicate that many boiling and near-boiling spring waters originati from an aquifer or aquifers at 200Â°C.
Although the reservoir depths at Geyser Bight are unknown, given the degree of thermal activity observed at the surface, it is reasonable to assume that the reservoir depths are unlikely to b much greater than 1 km.
As a comparison, the depth to the hot-water reservoir at the Makushin geothermal area on neighboring Unalaska Island, as determined by drilling, is about 0.6 km.

SitesG,J,K,andL We first analyze the origin of spring systems located in the upper part of the Geyser Creek valley floor.
As discussed previously, based on constituent ratios, these springs appear to be geochemically related.
As the starting point we use spring G8.
G8 has the highest concentration of Cl and dissolved solids of the entire suite of
- 77 -
samples, and its chemistry is therefore likely to be closest to the deep thermal water.
Lack of tritium eliminates mixing of cold meteoric waters as a factor in interpreting the concentrations and enthalpy of the 1988 68 spring waters.
Our assessment of quartz and cation geothermometers indicated site G thermal waters were derived from an aquifer with an estimated minimum temperature of 200Â°C.
Flow rate of the G8 spring was estimated to be 150 lpm in 1988.
Compared to table 16, conductive cooling of the G8 thermal water is unlikely to be a significant factor for depths 
This leaves boiling as the sole process by which these waters have cooled.
The boiling curve S1 in figure 34 represents the evaporative concentration of chloride in the thermal water as a function of enthalpy as it adiabatically cool8 and emerges as spring G8(`88).
Point A on this curve corresponds to the Cl concentration and enthalpy at the estimated reservoir temperature of 200Â°C.
Spring Gx and the springs sampled at site J issue at below boiling (80' to 90Â°C), are comparatively rich in Cl and Si02, and have relatively low Mg.
The location and flow rate of spring Gx sampled by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1975 (Ivan Barnes, written commun.) are not baown.
Flow rates of site J springs (C 30 lpm) indicate these springs could have cooled by conduction.
Perpendicular projection of a line from Gx, simulating conductive cooling, intersects the G8 (`88) boiling ewe at an enthalpy equivalent to 195Â°C which is consistent with the predicted reservoir temperature and the silicaenthalpy diagram (fig. 13).
Perpendicular projections from the J springs intersect the G8 boiling curve at enthalpies well below point A, which suggests J waters would have first boiled to point C, then conductively cooled to the surface.
Alternatively, the site J and Gx spring waters could have formed by near-surface dilution of G8 water with groundwater along the path Ml, followed in some cases by conductive cooling.
The latter explanation appears more consistent with silica-enthalpy and deuterium
Conductive cooling should have produced waters with deuterium values similar to deep thermal waters, Instead, figure 29c shows these waters have 6D values similar to site G boihng spring waters.
Mixing rather than conductive cooling is favored by analysis of the Si
The remaining spring waters at these sites and further down-valley are below boiling.
Concentrations of most constituents in these waters are substantially lower than spring G8 water (table 9).
One exception is Mg (0.9 to 2.8 ppm), where the increase in Mg correlates with decreasing chloride (fig. 25e).
The temperatures predicted by the NaK geothermometer for these springs are also significantly higher than the quartz conductive geothermometers.
The combination of these factors is strong evidence that these springs are a mixture of ascending thermal waters and shallow groundwaters.
Two mixing lines, M2 and M3, are illustrated on the Cl-enthalpy and Si@-enthalpy diagrams to account for these spring8 (figs. 34, 30).
Cl and Si
These values are similar to cold stream waters that enter Geyser Creek valley unaffected by input of thermal waters (table 10).
M2 extends to point C on the G boiling curve (enthalpy = 650 J/g), a hypothetical thermal water end-member that coincides with the perpendicular projection from Jl on the chloride-enthalpy diagram; M3 extends to point A.
The corresponding chloride and silica concentrations and temperatures for the hypothetical thermal water end members are 590 ppm, 290 ppm, 155Â°C respectively, for point C, and 530 ppm, 260 ppm, and 200Â°C, respectively for point A. Many dilute hot springs lie on or near Mz on both the Cl and Si@ -enthalpy diagrams, which suggests that their compositions and temperatures are fued mainly by mixing.
However, these spring8 have relatively low rates of flow, and conduction may have also played a part in cooling the ascending waters.
Springs that plot below Line M2 may have cooled additionally by conduction or by mixing with a different end member.
M3 illustrates mixing between the assumed 200Â°C reservoir water and groundwater.
Spring waters formed by mixing along this line had to cc
Both M2 and M3 mixing relationship8 appear to be generally consistent with stable isotope values (fig. 29c); some springs correlate with a deep, thermal-water end member and others with a shallow, fractionated thermal water.
The variation in 6D for the dilute springs suggests they were formed by mixing with groundwaters that had different 6D values.
The preceding paths for formation of the G, J, K, and L thermal springs are illustrated on the SiC+Cl diagram (fig. 26).
A deep water originating at point A cools adiabatically and by conduction to produce spring Gl waters.
Continued steam loss and reequilibration of Si@ leads to formation of G8.
Site J and Gx springs
- 78 -
form by conductive cooling from the point A steam-loss line or by near-surface dilution of G8 waters, or both.
Sic% had to re-equilibrate to varying degrees following dilution and conductive cooling to account for the remaining dilute springs.
Site H Application of chloride-enthalpy analysis to site H springs results in a comparatively simple boiling and mixing rnodel (fig. 34). out geothermometry showed that site H spring waters were derived from a reservoir with a minimum temperature of 165Â°C.
As with the down-valley sites, sulfate-water oxygen isotope geothermometry predicts even higher temperatures at deeper levels (225Â°C).
The most concentrated spring of our sample suite is 1980 H6; its values for Cl and Si@ were used to derive the composition of the parent thermal water for site H springs.
Although H6 (1980) has a relatively low rate of flow (50 lpm), conductive cooling is probably not an important factor given the much lower initial temperature in contrast to the values used to generate table 16.
The boiling curve S2 in figure 34 represents the evaporative concentration of chloride in the thermal water as a function of enthalpy as it adiabatically cools and emerges as spring H6 (1980).
Point D on this curve corresponds to the chloride concentration (520 ppm) and enthalpy at the estimated reservoir temperature of 165'C.
The point that correspondes to the "deep" reservoir is also shown on this curve.
All remaining springs sampled at site H can be explained as forming through a combination of mixing of point "D" type thermal water with groundwater B (line M4), followed by adiabatic cooling.
Na/K temperatures for these spring waters are nearly uniform, which indicates they originated from a common reservoir.
All sampled springs were at or near boiling point ant1 had relatively high rates of flow, factors that eliminate conduction as a major cause for cooling these waters.
H6 and H4 had nearly identical compositions in 1988 and appear to be slightly dilute versions of H6 as it was in 1980.
The presence of measurable Mg in H2 and H7 spring waters also indicates these springs have a cold-water component and must have cooled at least in part by mixing.
This mixing-boiling model for the formation of site H springs is consistent with both the Si@-Cl and Si@enthalpy diagrams (figs. 30, 26) and with the GD-chloride considerations for the 1988 samples (fig. 29b).
THERMAL WATER RELATIBN!SHIPS AND RESERVOIRS
The preceding analysis offers a contrast in the cooling style of ascending thermal waters.
At site H, dilution appears to occur at deeper levels followed by boiling as the mixed water rises to the surface.
At the down-valley sites, some steam loss appears to occur at deeper levels before mixing, with dilution primarily occurring in the near-surface region.
The proximity of Site H to the down-valley sites and the linear correlation of the more conservative chemical constituents with Cl suggest these spring waters are related at depth.
Tritium analysis showed that H6 (1988) has a component of modern water, but ambiguities in interpreting tritium make it difficult to estimate the amount.
In figure 34, type "D' waters could have formed from type "A" waters by boiling along S1, then mixing along path M4, or by first mixing along path M3, followed by boiling along 
In either case, residence in the "D" reservoir must have been long enough for potassium, silica, and other more reactive constituents to re-equilibrate to new temperature and wallrock conditions.
Travel and residence time for the thermal waters may also have been long enough for the SO4-oxygen isotope ratios to begin re-equilibrating to lower temperature conditions.
Figure 35 presents a conceptual model of the reservoir system at the Geyser Bight geothermal area as suggested by the preceding analysis.
Ia it, we show a "deep" reservoir (Rl) housed in a fractured quartz diorite to quartz monzonite pluton with a temperature of 265Â°C underlying the geothermal area that is recharged by deeply circulating meteoric water.
Chloride concentrations in this reservoir would be about 450 ppm.
Waters ascend from this deep reservoir to a reservoir at an intermediate depth (x2), where they regquilibrate to a temperature of 2ooOC.
Some water from this intermediate reservoir further migrates into a more shallow reservoir (R3), where it mixes with meteoric groundwaters and m-equilibrates to a temperature of about 165".
Alternatively, waters may ascend directly from RI to R3 and mix with deeply infiltrating meteoric waters.
Following re-equilibration, waters from R3 continue to ascend, further mix with meteoric groundwaters, and boil to the surface to emerge as springs and geysers at site H.

At R2, following re-equilibration, some waters ascend directly to the surface and emerge as boiling springs and geysers (for example, G8).
Part of the ascending thermal water branches off, mixes with a small amount of groundwater near the surface (which quenches boiling), and then cools conductively to form J springs.

As the deep thermal water ascends and boils, some or all sm may sepamte in the subsurface to heat marshy areas and perched groundwater tables and produce acid springs.
Steam may also separate at deeper levels and migrate directly along fractures to produce the fumaroles above the valley floor.
The chemistry of Q spring waters appears to have attributes of both H type (similar K/Cl) and G/J type (similar Rb/Cl and Cs/Cl) thermal waters.
Q spring waters may be derived from a reservoir intermediate between the other two or perhaps are a mixture of waters from both reservoirs.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The Geyser Bight geothermal = is a zone of hot springs and fumaroles located on the flank of Mt. Recheshnoi, a large c
Geologic basement consists of volcanic and marine volcanogenic rocks of probable Oligocene age (McLean and Hein, 1984).
These rocks are only gently deformed and lightly metamorphosed.
One or more quartzdiorite to quartz-monxonite stocks have intruded the bssement in the Geyser Bight area.
K-Ar dating of one sample at 9.5 Ma establishes a much younger plutonic event than is represented by the Oligocene stocks described by McLeM and Hein (1984) from southwestern Umnak.
Gur mapping shows that plutonic rock occurs much further up Geyser Creek valley than previously mapped by Byers (1959), which increases the probability that plutonic rock hosts the geothermal reservoir system.

The valley walls are composed of volcanic material, primarily lava flows, which were erupted first from several unnamed vents to the northeast, and then from Mt. Recheshnoi, to the southwest (fig. 2).
Since about 500 ka, the primary source of lava has been Mt. Recheshnoi.
The most nxent flows are mid-Holocene ande.site from flank vents on the upper slopes of Mt. Recheshnoi.
Two flank volcanic units are of sf
These are the Russian Bay valley rhyolite and the quartzbearing andesite above Hot Springs Bay.
These units document the presence of small volumes of silicic melt in the volcanic system and are notable in their rarity.
There are only four other reported rhyolite localities among late Quaternary volcanoes on the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands.
Dacite is more common throughout the Aleutians.
The Russian Bay rhyolite is not likely to come from a large, well-established, upper crustal rhyolitic chambr.
It is probably the result of heating and partial melting (or "sweating") of the upper crust by repeated passage of more mafic magma.
Such a process may also be responsible for the observed magmatic evolutionary trends at Mt. Reeheshnoi, which become generally more mafic with time.
This trend may reflect progrwive heating of the crust, which would prtiuce decreased thermal contrast between magma and crust, and thus decreased cooling and fractional crystallization of the magma (Myers and others, 1985; Myers and Marsh, 1987).
Geyser Right has one of the most extensive areas of thermal activity lmown in Alaska, and includes numerous boiling springs, steam vents, and three regions of fumarolic activity.
One fumarole, discovered in 1988, is superheated with a temperature in excess of 125OC.
Geyser Bight is the only area in Alaska with documented geysers.
In 1988, at least five springs were observed to geyser.
Vent geometries suggest that some other springs are also geysers whose eruptive cycles have not been observed, or have been geysers and are now inactive.
Thermal-spring activity appears to have declined significantly since 1947.
Using data from Brannock (1949), we estimate that convective heat discharged by spring flow was 25 MW in 1947 vs. in 1988.
The decline in spring activity may be due to the choking of spring vents by silica, 
Declining activity probably does not reflect reservoirs cooling because water and geothermometry results axe essentially unchanged between 1947 and 1908.
Byers and 16.7 MW and other chemistry
Most thermal-spring activity occurs at the head of Geyser Creek valley.
Chemical and isotopic data acquired in this study provide strong evidence that the thermal-spring waters are derived from two intermediatedepth reservoirs with minim urn temperatures (as estimated by geothermometry) of 200" and 165"C, respectively.
These reservoirs in turn appear to be related to an underlying parent reservoir with a minimum estimated temperature of 265Â°C.
The 3He/4He ratio of 7.4 found in gases that emanate from the thermal springs provides evidence for a magmatic influence on the hydrothermal system.
The 7.4 value is nearly the same as the average value for summit fumaroles in circurn-Pacific volcanic arcs, The most likely reservoir rock is the highly fractured quartz monzonite-to-diorite pluton that is exposed in lower Geyser Creek valley.
Reservoir recharge is likely through deeply infiltrating meteoric waters that have isotopic compositions similar to surface stream waters.
Tritium concentrations indicate thermal waters that feed spring G8 are over 70 yr old.
Thermal waters that feed spring H6 are either younger or have been diluted by near-surf- meteoric waters.
Examination of chemical equilibria suggests that the waters in the reservoir that feed sites G and J are in equilibrium with the mineral assemblage albite + K feldspar + muscovite + cLinoch.lore f quartz f prehnite f laumontite f kaolin
The site G boiling spring waters have low to r
Variations in spring-water chemistries can be explained through boiling and steam loss, and/or mixing of ascending thermal water-derived from one or the other of the intermediate reservoirs-with titrating meteoric waters.
The As/Cl ratios in Geyser Bight thermal-spring waters are among the highest reported for geothermal areas.
The source of B and As is unknown, but may be in part of magmatic origin.

Using the area1 extent of thermal activity at the surface as a reference, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated the area of the subsurface reservoir to be 6.3 km2 (Mariner and others, 1978).
This estimate can be considered a minimum, given our discovery of a superheated fumarole field on the lower east flank of Mt. Recheshnoi.
The presence of this field suggests the reservoir(s) may extend another 4 km to the southwest of Geyser Creek valley.
Using the assumptions regarding thickness of unexplored reservoirs (1.7 km) and methods established by the U.S. Geological Survey (Brook and others, 1978) for estimating geothermal reserves, we estimate that for a reservoir temperature of 200Â°C and an assumed depth to mid-reservoir of 1 km, the reservoir contains approximately 5.4 x 1018 J of thermal energy.
This energy base is sufficient to produce up to 132 MW of electrical power for 30 yr.
The corresponding estimates for a reservoir temperature of 265*C and a depth to mid-reservoir of 3 km are 7.3 x 1018 J of thermal energy and up to 225 MW of extractable electrical power for 30 yr.
We believe that the probability of finding a high-temperature, hot-water reservoir at Geyser Bight is excellent.
We recommend that follow-up work include a program of geophysical exploration and exploratory drilling to determine depth and extent of reservoirs.
The accessibility of the resource from the sea (5 km) and tie nearly certain probability of intercepting a hot water reservoir with temperatures of at least 200Â°C make Geyser Bight one of the most promising areas for geothermal resource development in the Aleutians.
Because of its remoteness from population centers, the site would be best developed for energy intensive industries that could locate and operate in the Aleutian Chain.
