Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act Great Lakes Project Name: Grant Recipient: Lockport STP Modifications (Secondary Clarifier Addition) City of Lockport
Project Description: The project will construct a final settling tank to complete the Lockport Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) as originally designed.
The project will alleviate frequent releases of incompletely treated municipal wastewater that occur during storm events to Eighteenmile Creek.
It will result in significant reductions in the amounts of solids, biochemical oxygen demand and toxics discharged to Eighteenmile Creek from bypasses and Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs).
Total Project Cost: Eligible Project Cost: Bond Act Share:
$2,163,000 $1,653,000 $1,405,050
Reason for Selection: 1.
Environmental benefit: The reduction in pollutant loadings will result in an improved aquatic environment in Eighteenmile Creek.
Fish consumption advisories due to PCBs, bird and animal reproductive problems, benthic community problems and restrictions on dredging activities have been documented downstream of bypasses or overflows.
2.
Evaluation factors: The project is a cost-effective way to reduce the amount of pollutants released by removing solids which contain toxics and improving the hydraulic capacity of the WWTF.
The bypasses and overflows associated with this facility have been identified as the source of many pollutants causing problems downstream.
