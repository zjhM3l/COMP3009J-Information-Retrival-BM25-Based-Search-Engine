Reverse mortgages are becoming popular in America.
Reverse mortgages are a special type of home loan that lets a homeowner convert the equity in his/her home into cash.
They can give older Americans greater financial security to supplement social security, meet unexpected medical expenses, make home improvements, and more.
If you are interested in a reverse mortgage, beware of scam artists that charge thousands of dollars for information that is free from HUD!
To report fraud or abuse in the reverse mortgage program, call toll-free 1-800-358-6216.
