EARTHQUAKES, DEFORMATION AND HYDROTHERMAL PROCESSES OF THE NORRIS GEYSER BASIN, YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK
A USGS Mendenhall Postdoctoral Position is available with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), primarily located in Menlo Park, CA, but involving significant collaboration with YVO partners at the University of Utah and Yellowstone National Park.
Mendenhall Opportunities provide full salary support and research expenses for two years.
They are intended for U.S. CITIZENS.
Information is available through the USGS Mendenhall Postdoctoral Program Website
The Yellowstone volcanic system is one of largest volcanic systems in the world and is a major area of seismicity, including a M7.5 earthquake in 1959, the largest historic event of the western U.S. interior.
In 2002 alone, there were more than 2350 earthquakes at Yellowstone, including over 500 triggered by the Nov. 2002, M7.9 Denali earthquake.
The Norris Geyser Basin is located at the NW edge of the 640,000-year-old Yellowstone caldera and is in the vicinity of several post-caldera rhyolite flows and at the intersection of large active faults.
Seismicity at the Norris area is characterized generally by swarms, but includes a M 6.1 event in 1975.
The caldera has a dynamic deformation history, uplifting and subsiding up to 10 meters over decadal to millennial timescales.
Historically it rose 1 m between 1923 and 1985, then subsided ~25 cm to 1995, and in the past ~7 years the NW caldera, including Norris, appears to uplifting.
Importantly, the recent uplift has been accompanied by expanding areas of hydrothermal activity in Norris Geyser Basin, including the creation of hot springs and fumaroles north of Norris and renewed activity of the Steamboat geyser, the world's tallest.
In July 2003, increased hydrothermal activity required closure to visitors of parts of the Norris Back Basin.
The relationship between these diverse phenomena, however, remains unknown.
The uplift itself may be due to magma intrusion, release and expansion of hydrothermal fluids through a permeability barrier, or some other mechanism.
The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) operates under a cooperative agreement between the USGS, the University of Utah (UU), and Yellowstone National Park to monitor and evaluate volcanic and tectonic activity at Yellowstone, to assess the accompanying geologic hazards, and to model the complex behavior of one of the world's most dynamic magmatic systems.
This postdoctoral opportunity would integrate efforts of all three YVO partners as a follow on to the Aug-Sept. 2003 collaborative seismic and GPS experiment at the Norris Geyser Basin.
In late July 2003, to investigate the recent anomalous hydrothermal activity, a network of 7 broadband seismometers, and 5 GPS receivers were deployed in the Norris Geyser basin, along with a series of thermal data loggers that recorded the temperature of the ground surface and waters emerging from hot springs and geysers.
This allows quantification of thermal water flux on a minute-by-minute basis.
The seismic and the continuous recording GPS network was operated over a ~2 month period following the discovery of the thermal disturbance.
The seismic and GPS instrumentation along with the thermal monitoring allows the integration of these various data for numerical modeling of the dynamics of the hydrothermal system.
Ideally, one can correlate between seismic and deformation signals with the volume and temperatures of thermal water and/or gas that emerges from the Norris Geyser Basin.
This will enable scientists to investigate the relationship between crustal strain, seismicity and hydrothermal activity.
By tracking the movement of heat, mass and seismic energy we hope to be able to differentiate whether crustal deformation is caused by renewed magma intrusion or release of hydrothermal fluids from beneath hypothesized permeability barriers.

The 2003 Norris field experiment also provides information on the nature of seismic and deformation energy in hydrothermal reservoirs, which is increasingly recognized as important to the field of volcano science.
Many of the earthquakes accompanying volcanic eruption are interpreted to be hydrothermally triggered when hot fluids are perturbed by migrating magma or exsolving magmatic gas.
Moreover, geysers produce similar seismic waves to those observed at volcanoes.
Harmonic tremor is induced by sharp pressure pulses inside the water column in a geyser in a process analogous to that occurring in Hawaiian or Strombolian volcanic activity.
Crustal deformation is a recognized signal of vertical and lateral magma migration and should also accompany hydrothermal fluid transport.
We seek a postdoctoral researcher to assist with the analysis and modeling of the data provided by this multidisciplinary study of the Norris Geyser Basin.
The researcher would work closely with scientists from the USGS and the University of Utah.
Though the official duty station would be Menlo Park, it is expected that at least 25% of the time would be spent at UU or with earth scientists at Yellowstone.
Topics of the researcher may include : (1) analyses of the seismic information including frequency-slowness, acoustic tomography, earthquake analyses including evaluation of long-period and very-long period signals, stress triggering, evaluation of wave properties such as attenuation characteristics, etc.
(2) kinematic analysis of ground deformation using the special GPS array, correlation of detailed deformation and strain fields at Norris to the regional deformation field of the caldera, and (3) integration and numerical modeling of hypothesized hydrothermal processes at Norris using the above geophysical data and related thermal, geochemical, volcanological, etc, information.
Primary Duty Station: Menlo Park, CA
Areas of Ph.D.: seismology, crustal deformation using GPS, numerical modeling
Qualifications: Applicants must meet the following qualification: Research Geophysicist
