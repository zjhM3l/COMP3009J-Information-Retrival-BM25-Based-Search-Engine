Sugar loan program Tariff-rate quotas Re-export programs North American Free Trade Agreement and U.S-Mexico sugar relations
Re-export programs The United States also operates two re-export programs to help U.S. sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugar-containing products compete in world markets.
The Refined Sugar Re-Export Program establishes a license against which a company can import sugar at world prices for refining and sale to replace sugar in the market that has been exported as refined sugar or as sugar in sugar-containing products.
The Sugar Containing Products Re-Export Program allows U.S. participants to buy sugar at world prices for use in products that will be exported onto the world market.
Raw cane sugar imports under the two programs are not subject to the sugar TRQs.
The 2002 Farm Act specifies that all refined sugars derived from either sugarbeets or sugarcane are substitutable under these programs.
North American Free Trade Agreement and U.S-Mexico sugar relations NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994.
The original agreement contained provisions that related to trade in sugar.
In order to secure U.S. Congressional support for NAFTA, the U.S. and Mexican Governments exchanged side-letters that altered the sugar provisions of the original NAFTA text.
Although Mexico has since rejected the validity of the side-letter agreement, the United States maintains that the side-letter provisions supercede those of the original NAFTA agreement.
The original provisions of NAFTA subjected Mexico's sugar exports to the United States to several conditions: * During the 15-year transition period, Mexican exports were to be limited to no more than Mexico's net production surplus of sugar (domestic sugar production less domestic sugar consumption).
At a minimum, Mexico was allowed to ship 7,258 metric tons of raw cane sugar duty-free.
* For the first 6 years of NAFTA, duty-free access was limited to no more than 25,000 metric tons, raw value.
In year 7, the maximum duty-free access quantity was to become 150,000 metric tons, and, in each subsequent year, was to increase by 10 percent.
* Importantly, NAFTA provided that these maximums could be exceeded if one of two conditions prevailed.
The first condition required that Mexico achieve net production surplus status for 2 consecutive marketing years.
The second condition specified that Mexico be a net surplus producer for the first year and be projected as a net surplus producer in the second year unless it was subsequently determined, contrary to the projection, that Mexico was not a net surplus producer for that year.
The side-letter agreement changed key sugar provisions of NAFTA.
The agreement stipulates that projected Mexican sugar production would have to exceed Mexico's consumption of both sugar and HFCS for Mexico to be considered a net surplus producer.
For the first 6 years of NAFTA, Mexico was entitled to duty-free access for sugar exports to the United States in the amount of its projected net surplus production, up to a maximum of 25,000 metric tons.
If Mexico was not a net surplus producer, it still would have duty-free access for 7,258 metric tons.
From FY 2001-07, Mexico will have duty-free access to the U.S. market for the amount of its surplus as measured by the formula, up to a maximum of 250,000 metric tons.
NAFTA specifies a declining high-tier tariff schedule for raw and refined sugar over the transition period to duty-free sugar trade in calendar year 2008.
For 2002, the raw sugar tariff is 9.07 cents a pound, and the refined sugar tariff is 9.61 cents a pound.
The raw sugar tariff drops about 1.5 cents each year (7.56 cents a pound in 2003), and the refined sugar tariff drops about 1.6 cents a year (8.01 cents a pound in 2003).
Both rates reach zero in calendar year 2008.
The economic incentive for Mexico to export high-tier tariff raw sugar exists if a price threshold is less than or equal to the U.S. sugar price.
The threshold is equal to the sum of the world price of sugar (New York Number 11 Contract), the high-tier NAFTA tariff rate, unit marketing costs (about 1.1 cents a pound for raw sugar), plus any marketing premiums.
The threshold price is compared with the U.S. price for entry in Gulf ports.
This U.S. price runs about 1 cent lower than the New York Number 14 Contract price (the U.S. price for raw sugar).
If the threshold is below the U.S. Gulf price, then Mexico would be encouraged to export sugar to the United States up to that point where the marginal returns from exporting to the U.S. and world markets are equalized.
If the return to exporting to the United States is at all levels higher than shipping to the rest of the world, then Mexico is encouraged to ship all exportable sugar to the U.S. market.
For example, if world raw sugar prices are in the range of 7 cents a pound in 2003, any U.S. raw sugar price above 18 cents a pound would signal a greater return to Mexican producers by exporting to the U.S. market instead of the world market.
High-tier tariff imports could cause total sugar imports to exceed the 1.532 million STRV import ceiling necessary for the authority of USDA to set marketing allotments to comply with the no-cost provision of the 2002 Farm Act.

The tariff-rate quota system ensures that there is an adequate supply of sugar at reasonable prices for both consumers and producers.
The United States also operates the Refined Sugar and Sugar-Containing Products Re-Export Programs to allow U.S. refiners to be competitive in global refined and sugar-containing products markets.
Sugar loan program The primary policy tools available to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to assist sugarcane and sugarbeet producers are contained in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Act).
The U.S. sugar program provides for USDA to make loans available to processors of domestically grown sugarcane at a rate of 18 cents per pound and to processors of domestically grown sugarbeets at the rate of 22.9 cents per pound for refined sugar.
The 2002 Farm Act allows processors to obtain loans for "in-process" sugar and syrups at 80 percent of the loan rate.
Loans are taken for a maximum term of 9 months and must be liquidated along with interest charges by the end of the fiscal year in which the loan was made.
Unlike most other commodity programs, sugar loans are made to processors and not directly to producers.
This is because sugarcane and sugarbeets, being bulky and very perishable, must be processed into sugar before they can be traded and stored.
To qualify for loans, processors must agree to provide payments to producers that are proportional to the value of the loan received by the processor for sugarbeets and sugarcane delivered by producers.
USDA has the authority to establish minimum producer payment amounts.
The loans are nonrecourse.
This means that when the loan matures, USDA must accept sugar pledged as collateral as payment in full in lieu of cash repayment of the loan, at the discretion of the processor.
"In-process" sugar and syrups must be converted into raw cane or refined beet sugar at no cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) before being eligible for forfeiture.
The processor cannot be required to notify USDA of the intention to forfeit the sugar under loan.
By forfeiting the sugar, the processor effectively withdraws sugar from the market, thereby reducing excess supply and helping to support the market price of sugar.
The 2002 Farm Act requires USDA, to the maximum extent possible, to operate the U.S. sugar loan program at no cost to the Federal Government.
Specially, this provision means that USDA must operate the program in order to avoid the forfeiture of sugar to CCC.
In order to discourage forfeiture of nonrecourse loans, the sugar price at the time of loan repayment must be high enough to cover the loan principal plus interest expenses and other costs.
The 2002 Farm Act gives USDA the authority to accept bids from sugarcane and sugarbeet processors to obtain raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar in CCC inventory in exchange for the reduction of the production of raw cane sugar or refined beet sugar.
This is one way to control expected excess (or "price-depressing") supplies of sugar.
The 2002 Farm Act notes specifically that this authority is in addition to any other authority that CCC may have under any other law.
(For example, CCC relied on the Cost Reduction Options of the 1985 Farm Security Act (section 1009) for its authority for the Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Diversion Programs for the 2000-01 crop years.)
As another way to guarantee the sugar loan program operates at no cost to the Federal Government, USDA is required to establish flexible marketing allotments for sugar.
The overall quantity of sugar to be allotted for a crop year is determined by subtracting the sum of 1.532 million short tons, raw value (STRV) and carry-in stocks of sugar (including CCC inventory) from the USDA's estimate of sugar consumption and reasonable carryover stocks at the end of the crop year.
USDA is required to adjust allotment quantities to avoid the forfeiture of sugar to CCC.
The overall allotment quantity is divided between refined beet sugar at 54.35 percent of the overall quantity and raw cane sugar at 45.65 percent of the overall quantity.
For cane sugar, Hawaii and Puerto Rico are jointly allotted 325,000 STRV.
The mainland cane sugar producing States' (Florida, Louisiana, and Texas) allocations would be assigned based on past marketings of sugar, the ability to market sugar in the current year, and past processing levels.
Beet sugar processors are assigned allotments based on their sugar production for the 1998-2000 crop years.
The 2002 Farm Act provides for a number of contingencies that could require reassignment of allotments during the crop year.
USDA's authority to operate sugar marketing allotments is suspended if USDA estimates that sugar imports levels for human consumption, not including the Re-export Programs (see below), will exceed 1.532 million STRV such that the overall allotment quantity would have to be reduced.
The marketing allotments would remain suspended until such time that imports have been restricted, eliminated, or otherwise reduced to or below the 1.532 million STRV level.
Tariff-rate quotas
A tariff-rate quota (TRQ) is a two-tiered tariff for which the tariff rate charged depends on the volume of imports.
A lower (in-quota) tariff is charged on imports within the quota volume.
A higher (over-quota) tariff is charged on imports in excess of the quota volume.
The United States establishes separate TRQs for imports of raw cane sugar and for imports of certain other sugars, syrups, and molasses.
Authority to establish TRQs is under Additional U.S. note 5(a)(I) to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS).
Each year, the Secretary of Agriculture announces the quantity of sugar that may be imported at a nominal tariff rate.
Any additional annual quantity may be imported at a higher tariff rate.
In the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the United States agreed to make available for import a minimum quantity (1.256 million STRV) of raw and refined sugar each marketing year (October to September).
Included in this amount is a commitment to import at least 24,251 STRV of refined sugar.
The raw cane sugar TRQ is allocated to 40 countries based on a representative period (1975-81) when trade was relatively unrestricted.
An additional allocation is made available to Mexico to satisfy U.S. obligations under NAFTA.
The refined sugar tariff rate quota includes several components, including specific allocations to Canada, Mexico, and a quantity of refined sugar that is available to all countries on a first-come, first-served basis.
The first-come, first-served section of the refined sugar TRQ also includes a category for specialty sugars such as organic sugars.
In addition, the United States administers TRQs on imports of various sugar-containing products that originally had been subject to absolute quotas under Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933.
There are four TRQs on imports of similar products from countries other than Mexico.
Re-export programs The United States also operates two re-export programs to help U.S. sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugar-containing products compete in world markets.
The Refined Sugar Re-Export Program establishes a license against which a company can import sugar at world prices for refining and sale to replace sugar in the market that has been exported as refined sugar or as sugar in sugar-containing products.
