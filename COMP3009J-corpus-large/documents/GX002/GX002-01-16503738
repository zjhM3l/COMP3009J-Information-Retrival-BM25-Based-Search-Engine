Stopping Spambots: A Spambot Trap.
He advocates giving up mailto and all references to email addresses on a web site.
Unfortunately many companies do this and it is a very bad practice because it makes it really difficult to contact the company.
Web "email" is slow and awkward compared to Unix mail tools.
This is not a good solution.

One of the people responsible for unethical spamming: Ronald Scelson.
Spam costs him very little but costs the target money (storage, comptuer time and time to delete), but this guy doesn't care.

"This simplest way to fight spammers is to NEVER buy from them.
Buying only encourages spammers.
A boycott should also include major businesses who you've done business with.
Let them know you won't buy anything more until they drop their spam policy."

* 2003 Mar 12: I got this email:
Subject: Interesting idea Fight Evil Telemarketing is certainly a plague upon our nation, but San Francisco Chronicle columnist Steve Rubenstein has come up with probably the most elegant solution of our time with three little words: "Hold On, Please."
Say these words, put down your phone and go run a marathon or cook up some paella.
You know it's time to hang up the phone when you hear that little "beep, beep, beep" tone that indicates the call has been disconnected.
The brilliant theory is that if everyone did this, it would waste massive amounts of telemarketing call time, which of course would equate to a massive loss of telemarketing dollars and bring the sales boiler rooms to a grinding halt.
I really like this idea.
Steve should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, or at least a Pulitzer.
Likewise with spam.
Suppose a spammer sends out 10 million spams, hoping to get 100 customers.
Suppose that 1000 people flood their web site, phone number and email address with 10 complaints each.
Then the spammer will spend so much time dealing with complaints that they will lose money.
Note that spammers always leave a trail back to themselves, so it is always possible to do this.
Further, only a few people have to do this a small portion of the time to make spam uneconomical.
