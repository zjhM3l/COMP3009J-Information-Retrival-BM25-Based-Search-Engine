Floor Statement by Senator Edwards PUNISHING TERRORIST HOAXES ACT OF 2001 Friday, November 9, 2001 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Punishing Terrorist Hoaxes Act of 2001.
In the days since September 11, all of us have learned that anthrax hoaxes are no joking matter.
They are acts of terror in the true sense of the word because they inflict great fear and anxiety on innocent people.
In addition, these hoaxes drain resources from police and emergency workers--resources desperately needed not only for the real war on terror, but for all of the ordinary emergencies that continue to arise every single day.
According to recent reports, there have been some 160 anthrax and other terrorism hoaxes since September 11.
In Connecticut, one hoax triggered the evacuation of 800 government employees for two days.
Hoaxes in Virginia and Oregon have shut down post offices.
In my State of North Carolina, from Greensboro to Chapel Hill, hoaxes have targeted and terrified workers at family planning medical clinics--workers who already too often must live in fear.
I have spoken with law enforcement officials in North Carolina who believe we need new federal legislation specifically to fight hoaxes.
At a hearing of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information earlier this week, officials from the Bush Administration requested that legislation.
In response to several questions that I asked, they articulated the very real need: Current law prohibits terrorist "threats," but terrorism hoaxes may not always be viewed as threats because the people perpetrating the hoaxes are not able and do not intend to carry out actual terrorist acts.
Yet these hoaxes must be punished.
The legislation I propose builds on proposals by other Senators on both sides of the aisle, including Senator Leahy, Senators Biden and Hatch, and Senators Schumer and DeWine.
There are two things that distinguish the legislation I propose, and I want to highlight those.
First, my proposal includes "findings" about the need for this legislation.
In recent decisions holding that federal laws are not proper exercises of Congress's "commerce clause" power and therefore are not constitutional, the Supreme Court has said that "findings" about a real federal need are important.
Although I don't agree with those recent cases, I want to do everything I can to make sure this statute is upheld in the courts.
The addition of findings is one way to do that while still enacting the ban we need.
Second, my proposal establishes two federal hoax crimes, not just one.
All persons who perpetrate hoaxes are punishable by up to two years in prison.
In addition, persons who perpetrate hoaxes with intent to cause fear, in a manner reasonably likely to cause an emergency response, are punishable by up to six years in prison.
The line we are drawing is a line between people who really and truly think they are "just joking" and people who want to terrorize others.
Both kinds of hoaxes should be felony crimes.
And the person who wants to inflict fear deserves a stiffer sentence than the person who does not.
That is a line we regularly draw in the criminal law.
We punish people with evil motives more than people who are reckless or stupid.
Federal law makes that distinction in the Bomb Hoax Act, 18 U.S.C. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 35, which sets up a lesser offense requiring no criminal intent, and a greater offense requiring that the perpetrator act "maliciously."
I ask the Congress to enact the Punishing Terrorist Hoaxes Act of 2001.
And whether we enact this legislation or one of my colleagues' proposals, I ask the Congress to enact an anti-hoax bill before we go out of session.
We owe it to police officers, public health officials, and the American people.
