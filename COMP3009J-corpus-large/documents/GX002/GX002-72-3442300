TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ OIL CONCENTRATION AND FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF ACHENES OF CANADIAN HELIANTHUS (ASTERACEAE) SPECIES Author(s): SEILER GERALD J BROTHERS MARY E Interpretive Summary:
Sunflower ranks fourth among field crops grown in the world for the production of edible oil.
Sunflower oil is a high quality edible oil because of it's fatty acid composition.
The oil also has industrial uses.
Oil quantity and quality are important characteristics that need to be maintained as we strive to improve all aspects of sunflower production.
The wild ancestors of cultivated sunflower offer the potential to increase the diversity of the oil quality characteristics in cultivated sunflower.
The progenitors of cultivated sunflower are good sources of desirable insect and disease characteristics and also have similar fatty acid composition, but a much lower oil concentration.
Oil concentration can be quickly increased by introduction of the wild species into the cultivated sunflower, which raises it to an acceptable level.
The wild species also offers the potential of lowering the saturated fatty acids making the oil more desirable and competitive with other edible oils.
A diversity of fatty acid has been observed in the wild sunflower species and are available for use in oil quality improvement of cultivated sunflower.
