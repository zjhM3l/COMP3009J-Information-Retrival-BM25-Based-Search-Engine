As a reward for his valuable discovery, the Spanish crown granted Columbus the right to bear arms.
His new Coat of Arms added the royal charges of Castile and Leon and an image of islands to his traditional family arms.
Columbus further modified the design to include a continent beside the pictured islands.
Before his final voyage, the Spanish monarchs prepared a Book of Privileges, a collection of agreements showing how Columbus was remunerated for his explorations.
In 1502, four copies of the book were known to exist.
The Library of Congress's precious copy of this work is considered one of the "Top Treasures" included in the online exhibition American Treasures of the Library of Congress.

The first recorded celebration of Columbus Day in the United States took place on October 12, 1792.
Organized by The Society of St. Tammany, also known as the Columbian Order, it commemorated the 300th anniversary of Columbus's landing.
The 400th anniversary of the event, however, inspired the first official Columbus Day holiday in the United States.
In 1892, President Benjamin Harrison issued a proclamation urging Americans to mark the day.
The public responded enthusiastically, organizing school programs, plays, and community festivities across the country.
Columbus and the Discovery of America, Imre Kiralfy's "grand dramatic, operatic, and ballet spectacle," is among the more elaborate tributes created for this commemoration.
The World's Columbian Exposition, by far the most ambitious event planned for the celebration, opened in Chicago the summer of 1893.

Over the following decades, the Knights of Columbus, an international Roman Catholic fraternal benefit society, lobbied state legislatures to declare October 12 a legal holiday.
Colorado was the first state to do so on April 1, 1907.
New York declared Columbus Day a holiday in 1909 and on October 12, 1909, New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes led a parade that included the crews of two Italian ships, several Italian-American societies, and legions of the Knights of Columbus.
Since 1971 Columbus Day, designated as the second Monday in October, has been celebrated as a federal holiday.
In many locations across the country Americans parade in commemoration of the day.
