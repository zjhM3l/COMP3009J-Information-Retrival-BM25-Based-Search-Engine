Background.
Studies on the health benefits of breastfeeding in developed countries have shown conflicting results.
These studies often fail to account for confounding, reverse causality, and dose-response effects.
We addressed these issues in analyzing longitudinal data to determine if breastfeeding protects US infants from developing diarrhea and ear infections.
Methods.
Mothers participating in a mail panel provided information on their infants at ages 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 months.
Infants were classified as exclusively breastfed; high, middle, or low mixed breast-and formula-fed; or exclusively formula-fed.
Diarrhea and ear infection diagnoses were based on mothers' reports.
Infant age and gender; other liquid and solid intake; maternal education, occupation, and smoking; household size; family income; and day care use were adjusted for in the full models.
Results.
The risk of developing either diarrhea or ear infection increased as the amount of breast milk an infant received decreased.
In the full models, the risk for diarrhea remained significant only in infants who received no breast milk compared with those who received only breast milk (odds ratio = 1.8); the risk for ear infection remained significant in the low mixed feeding group (odds ratio = 1.6) and among infants receiving no breast milk compared with those who received only breast milk (odds ratio = 1.7).
Conclusions.
Breastfeeding protects US infants against the development of diarrhea and ear infection.
Breastfeeding does not have to be exclusive to confer this benefit.
In fact, protection is afforded in a dose-response manner.
The more breast milk an infant receives in the first 6 months of life, the less likely that he or she will develop diarrhea or ear infection.
Risk of Diarrhea Related to Iron Content of Infant Formula: Lack of Evidence to support the Use of Low-iron Formula as a supplement for Breastfed Infants.
1997.
Paula D. Scariati, Laurence M. Grummer-Strawn, Sara Beck fein, and Ray Yip. Pediatrics 99(3):e2.
Background.
Concern has been raised by infant feeding experts that supplementing breastfed infants with iron-fortified formula rather than low-iron formula may have an undesirable impact on their gastrointestinal flora.
Thus far, there have been no clinical studies to address this issue directly.
We compared the reported frequency of diarrhea for breastfed infants given iron-fortified formula with those fed low-iron formula.
Methods.
Mothers participating in a mail panel provided feeding and diarrhea information on their infants at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12 months (n = 1743).
Infants were grouped into five feeding categories: (1) breast milk only, (2) breast milk and low-iron formula, (3) breast milk and iron-fortified formula, (4) low-iron formula only, and (5) iron-fortified formula only.
We calculated the number of diarrheal episodes per week for each feeding category and used rate ratios to estimate the relative^ impact of low-iron and iron-fortified formulas.
Results.
Among infants who received both breast milk and formula, the rate ratio for iron-fortified formula versus low-iron formula was 1.06 (confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.34), indicating that the type of formula a breastfed infant receives does not significantly affect the frequency of diarrhea.
Conclusions.
We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that breastfed infants given iron-fortified formula are at greater risk of having diarrhea.
This, in addition to the fact that iron-fortified formula has played a major role in preventing childhood iron deficiency anemia, supports the current recommendation that any formula given to infants be fortified with iron. food, diarrhea, breastfeeding, iron.
