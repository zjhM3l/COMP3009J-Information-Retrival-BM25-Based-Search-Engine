OSM Seal Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Awards 2004 Rules Toolbar3.gif __________________________________________________________________ History and objectives of the program.
The Surface Mining Law was enacted to ensure that lands mined for coal would be restored to original condition as part of the mining process, and to restore unreclaimed coal mined lands that were abandoned before 1977.
Today, abandoned mine land reclamation funded under the Surface Mining Law has eliminated thousands of dangerous health and safety problems resulting from abandoned mine lands throughout the country.
Yet despite the countrys significant progress in eliminating abandoned mine land problems, there is little public awareness that this reclamation has taken place.
When there are highly visible scars at an unreclaimed landscape, most people recognize the legacy of past coal mining.
But, after abandoned mine problems are eliminated and reclamation is complete, it is nearly impossible for any observer to see that health and safety problems once existed on the site.
Ironically, the better the reclamation, the less apparent it is.
Thus, the best reclamation is virtually invisible.
To give well-earned public recognition to those responsible for the nations most outstanding achievements in abandoned mine land reclamation the Interior Departments Office of Surface Mining began the annual Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Awards Program in 1992.
The Program publicly recognizes outstanding abandoned mine land reclamation and publicizes exemplary reclamation techniques.
The process used to select the winners includes judging by those most closely involved with reclamation projects state and federal reclamation program staff.
Each state/tribal Abandoned Mine Land Program selects the best project within its state/tribal boundary.
Nominations are posted on the Internet and using an electronic ballot, each director from state/tribal Abandoned Mine Land Programs and Office of Surface Mining Field Offices selected the winning reclamation by ranking the nominations.
Four award winners are selected using this process three regional awards and one national award.
The nominations receiving the best score in each of the three coal regions are selected as Regional Winners.
The regional winner with the best score is selected the National Winner.
In addition, the public selects one project they think is best and the project receiving the most votes becomes the winner of the Peoples Choice Award.
What projects are eligible for an award?
Abandoned mine land projects funded wholly or in part by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and completed by approved state or tribal programs are eligible for an award.
This includes all coal, non-coal, high-priority, and emergency projects.
Abandoned mine reclamation projects completed under the Rural Abandoned Mine Program (RAMP) are eligible if completed jointly with state/tribal programs.
Abandoned mine reclamation completed by citizen groups or other (non-state/non-tribal) organizations are not eligible for these awards and may be recognized by the Office of Surface Mining under separate awards programs.
One project may be submitted by each state/tribal program each year.
