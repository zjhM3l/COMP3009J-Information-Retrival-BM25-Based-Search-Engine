Introduction
Mount St. Helen's May 18, 1980 Eruption The 1980 cataclysmic eruption of Mount St. Helens in southwestern Washington ushered in a decade marked by more worldwide volcanic disasters and crises than any other in recorded history.
Volcanoes killed more people (over 28,500) in the 1980's than during the 78 years following the 1902 eruption of Mont Pelee (Martinique).
Not surprisingly, volcanic phenomena and attendant hazards received attention from government authorities, the news media, and the general public.
As part of this enhanced global awareness of volcanic hazards, the U.S. government significantly expanded the Volcano Hazards Program of the U.S.Geological Survey in response to the eruptions or volcanic unrest during the 1980's at Mount St. Helens (Washington), Mauna Loa and Kilauea (Hawaii), Long Valley Caldera (California), and Redoubt Volcano (Alaska).
Entering the 1990's, the sustained eruptive activity at Kilauea persists unabated, Mount St. Helens and Redoubt are still erupting intermittently, and the caldera unrest at Long Valley also continues, albeit less energetically than during the early 1980's.
In addition to the areas mentioned above, the U. S. has many other active or potentially active volcanoes -- over 65, which is more than all other countries except for Indonesia and Japan.
Most of these volcanoes are located in Alaska, and 55 of them, including 8 on the U.S. mainland, have shown activity since the U.S. was founded, just some 200 years ago.
Eruptions for U. S. volcanoes can generate serious volcanic hazards, any of which can be deadly: glowing rivers of molten rock (lava flows), devastating shock waves and fiery blasts of debris from volcanic explosions (pyroclastic surges), red-hot avalanches of rock fragments racing down mountainsides (pyroclastic flows), and suffocating blankets of volcanic ash falling from the sky (pyroclastic falls).
But that is not all.
A number of equally deadly processes involve water (Pierson, 1989), and in fact, over 80 percent of the more than 28,500 volcano-related fatalities this past decade were caused by hydrologic processes.
Although many hydrologic hazards at volcanoes are directly associated with eruptions, others are not.
It is the latter that are especially dangerous because debris avalanches, debris flows, and floods can strike without warning, for example, following periods of heavy rainfall, and they occur with a greater frequency than eruptions.
Furthermore, hydrologic hazards typically endanger populations in river valleys considerable distances from their source volcanoes -- as far as 150 kilometers downstream.
Within the last few thousand years, large debris avalanches, debris flows, and (or) floods have occurred at most volcanoes in the Cascades and in Alaska (Heath, 1960; Hyde and Crandell, 1978; Riehle and others, 1981; Beget, 1982; Siebert, 1984; Gallino and Pierson, 1985; Cameron and Pringle, 1986; Osterkamp and others, 1986; Riehle and others, 1987; Siebert and others, 1987; Major and Newhall, 1989; Siebert and others, 1989; Nye and Turner, 1990; Scott and others, 1990).
Damaging earthquakes and sea waves (tsunami) may also be closely related to volcanoes and volcanic activity.
Large earthquakes related to intrusion of magma into Hawaii's active rift zones of Mauna Loa and Kilauea have caused extensive damage on land and also triggered tsunami in 1868 and 1975 that devastated low-lying coastal areas (Tilling and others, 1976).
Large landslides from Alaskan volcanoes near the sea have also generated tsunami that destroyed coastal villages (Kienle and others, 1987).
Recent research in Hawaii has shown that much larger tsunami have, in the more distant past, washed as much as 366 meters up on some of the islands (Moore and Moore, 1984).
These waves appear to have been generated by gigantic submarine landslides that removed large parts of the Hawaiian volcanoes (Moore and others, 1989).
These colossal failures have also torn away and submerged subaerial parts of islands.
A short list of notable eruptions and other volcanic activity at U. S. volcanoes during the 20th century is given in Table 1.
A more complete listing of U.S. volcanoes active within the last 2,000 years, as well as older volcanic areas that have active geothermal systems, have shown recent signs of unrest, or which represent a particularly catastrophic event are shown in Appendix 1.
Not listed are several dormant volcanic fields on the U.S. mainland that have erupted in the past 10,000-50,000 years and which could erupt again (Smith and Luedke, 1984; Simkin and others, 1981; Miller, 1989).
The eruption recurrence intervals for such volcanic fields are large; many of these fields have a deceptively tranquil appearance, show no obvious signs of their violent past, and the land overlying and surrounding these fields is used for agriculture, recreation, or is developed for commercial or residential use.
However, the possibility remains that one or more of the currently inactive volcanic fields could erupt again, probably preceded by a period of unrest sufficient to prepare for renewed eruption.

The hazards posed by the U.S. volcanoes provide a fairly complete sampling of hazards shown by volcanoes worldwide.
The variety of hazards, in conjunction with the relative abundance of volcanic systems having eruption potential in the U.S., are difficult challenges for the U.S. Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Program.
To address these challenges, we rely on observations and studies made at currently active volcanoes to understand their past histories.
The combination of present observations and the reconstructed history of volcanoes, both currently inactive and recently active, allows scientists to estimate the types of hazards and the likelihood of their occurrence for all potentially active or otherwise unstable volcanoes and volcanic areas in the U.S.
We recognize, however, that an improved understanding of volcanic processes in itself is insufficient to mitigate volcanic hazards.
Effective an timely communication of hazards information to emergency-management authorities before and during a volcanic crisis is equally, if not more, important in reducing volcanic risk.
This publication summarizes the Volcano Hazards Program -- its goals, the activities designed to achieve these goals, some key accomplishments of the past two decades, and a plan for work in the 1990's.
Additional background information and bibliographic resources on volcanology and volcano hazards are given by Tilling (1989a,b).
Acknowledgments
This summary of the Volcano Hazards Program, updated from Bailey and others (1983), was conceived at a workshop held in Vancouver, Washington, in November, 1989, convened by Bob Christiansen, John Costa, and Chris Newhall.
The workshop brought together persons from the Water Resources and Geologic Divisions of the U.S. Geological Survey to discuss all aspects of the Volcano Hazards Program. ... __________________________________________________________________
Mount St. Helens Reawakens
Mount St. Helen's May 18, 1980 Eruption The first earthquakes struck on March 20, 1980.
Seismologists quickly determined that the quakes were centered beneath a snowy mountain, known to them, but not to the general public, as a potentially dangerous volcano, which had been dormant for more than a century.
During the next week, the number of earthquakes increased, and these quakes triggered snow avalanches, which in turn forced closure of winter recreation areas around the mountain.
Geologists and geophysicists converged on the scene to monitor the activity and met with local authorities to alert them to the possibility of an eruption.
On March 27, steam and ash exploded from the summit of the volcano and marked the beginning of several small eruptions during the next two months.
Public authorities prudently closed the area surrounding the mountain after being informed of the volcano's past violent behavior by those who had conducted careful geological studies during the preceding 20 years.
Although closure was a necessary precautionary measure, it created discontent and even anger on the part of some citizens who wanted access to their property and recreation sites.
Continued monitoring of the volcano indicated that its north flank, which towered above the most popular recreation area, was becoming increasingly unstable.
Warnings were issued for landslides and large-scale snow avalanches.
These warnings supported the need for continued closure of the area, although public pressure eventually led to brief, authorized forays into the area by cabin owners to retrieve belongings.
One such trip was scheduled for the morning of May 18, but it never took place.
At 8:32 a.m. on May 18, an earthquake triggered a gigantic landslide on the unstable north flank, which in turn unleashed a scorching, explosive blast of hot gas laden with rock fragments; massive floods of mud and rock down most river valleys; flows of hot, gas-rich volcanic rock; and an enormous plume of ash.
The water-soaked landslide debris produced a series of dense slurries that raced downstream and nearly severed Interstate Highway 5 and the AMTRAK rail line connecting Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.
These debris flows brought shipping on the Columbia River to a halt and came close to blocking cooling-water intakes at an operating nuclear powerplant.
These events transformed a lush landscape of dense, green forest into a dusty volcanic wasteland and killed 57 people who were too close to the mountain.
The eastern half of the State, where people were virtually unaware of any volcanic hazard, was blanketed with ash.
The death toll, though large, could have been much, much higher without the previous warnings and resultant land closure.
Luck also played a role in keeping the number of fatalities down.
Had the eruption occurred on Monday rather than Sunday, several hundred loggers, working in an area near the volcano but outside the closed area, would have died.
During the next decade, continued enforcement of restricted zones and careful observation and prediction of activity warned the public of impending eruptions, and no additional lives were lost.
Research into what had caused the catastrophic eruption led to increased appreciation of the inherent instability of high, snow-covered volcanoes and the hazards they pose.

Program goals and activities throughout the 1980's
The Volcano Hazards Program was formed with the goals of:
* preventing loss of life and property resulting from volcanic eruptions and volcano-related hydrologic events * minimizing economic hardship and social disruption that commonly occur when volcanoes threaten to erupt.
To understand the hazards we extensively monitor currently active volcanoes, and concurrently conduct a vigorous program of research in volcanic processes with the end goal of discovering how volcanoes work.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides volcano-hazards information at a number of levels: to Federal, State, and local officials, to local citizens, and to other concerned groups.
In delivering hazard information that others must act on, the USGS does not dictate or even recommend specific mitigation measures, because such measures must be balanced by social and economic considerations beyond USGS mandate or expertise.
Rather, the program provides information about volcanic hazards that will help people to choose and manage the risks associated with living near a volcano.
The Volcano Hazards Program includes the following activities:
* Identifying potentially active volcanoes.
* Directly observing, measuring, and analyzing volcanic unrest.
* Studying and monitoring volcanic and hydrologic processes associated with different kinds of volcanoes and eruptions.
* Reconstructing eruptive and erosional history of volcanoes through study of morphologic and depositional evidence of past events.
* Studying effects of volcanic emissions on the atmosphere, soil, and water supply.
* Preparing geologic and hydrologic volcano hazard maps for individual volcanoes.
* Coordinating with officials responsible for public safety prior to and during eruptive activity.
* Communicating information about potential hazards at a volcano, including the likelihood of their occurrence and potential areas of impact, to public officials, emergency management personnel, and the population at risk.
The activities of the program enable the accumulation of fundamental information on the nature of volcanic processes and associated hazards and, at the same time, provide the means for public officials to respond rapidly and effectively to volcanic crises.
Program activities are carried out at many USGS facilities and involve the active collaboration of other agencies-Federal, State, and local and several academic institutions.

Volcano Observatories - Taking the Pulse of Active Volcanoes
Pu'u O'u Eruption, April 14, 1986 To study active volcanism, the Volcano Hazards Program depends principally on the research and monitoring conducted at three permanent installations: the Hawaiian, Cascades, and Alaska Volcano Observatories.
Each observatory provides continuous and periodic monitoring of the seismicity, other geophysical changes, ground movements, gas chemistry, and hydrologic conditions and activity between and during eruptions.
They also provide a detailed record of eruptions in progress.
These observations serve to characterize eruptive behavior, identify the nature of precursory activity leading to eruption, define the processes by which different types of deposits are emplaced, and specify the hazards that could be unleashed by each kind of eruption.
From direct observation of precursory signs, it is possible to anticipate eruptions.
Underlying all observatory operations is an ongoing program of fundamental research in volcanic processes, supplemented by collaborative studies conducted at other USGS centers.
Such research typically includes direct interpretation of the monitoring and eruption data, and it leads to formulation of conceptual models that can be tested by theoretical or laboratory simulations of volcanic systems.
The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO)
HVO is the U.S. Geological Survey's oldest such facility, founded in 1912 by Thomas A. Jaggar and run continuously by the USGS since 1948 (Heliker and others, 1986).
It is located on the summit of Kilauea, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, on the Island of Hawaii.
With the frequent eruptions at Kilauea and nearby Mauna Loa, HVO is a training ground for most of the volcanologists at the USGS.
Many volcano-monitoring techniques used worldwide were originally developed at HVO, which is a testing ground for new techniques and instruments.
The existence of HVO gave the USGS the unique capability of responding to activity at other U.S. volcanoes.
When Mount St. Helens reawakened in March 1980, the USGS was well prepared to respond to the crisis.
Scientists who had previously deciphered the volcanic history of Mount St. Helens, together with HVO alumni, quickly assembled to monitor the seismic activity and steam explosions.
All worked together with the many agencies and public officials who were anxious to know when and if a large eruption was going to occur and what hazards it might create.
Guided by USGS information, public officials designated zones of restricted access, and the loss of life from the May 18th eruption was thereby minimized, even though the timing of this event could not be precisely predicted.
Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO)
After the devastating explosive eruption in 1980, the Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO), in Vancouver, Washington, was founded and staffed with hydrologists, geologists, geochemists, and geophysicists (Brantley and Topinka, 1984).
The observatory quickly broke new ground in its study of the ongoing eruption cycle at Mount St. Helens.
In mapping and interpreting the origin of the deposits of the May 18 eruption, scientists had the unique advantage of direct observation of the landslides, eruption, and volcanic debris flows.
Monitoring the growth of the lava dome in the crater of Mount St. Helens resulted in accurate predictions, 1 to 3 days in advance, of 16 out of 17 dome-building eruptions-an unprecedented feat in the young science of volcanology.
Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO)
In 1988, the USGS added a third volcano observatory, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, to expand and coordinate existing monitoring of the many active volcanoes along the Alaska Peninsula and in the Aleutian Islands.
Many international flightpaths lie directly over Alaska, and the frequent eruptions of these volcanoes pose a serious hazard to aircraft far downwind.
Study of Alaskan eruptions also provides more frequent opportunities to study volcanic activity similar to that of the less frequently active Cascade Range volcanoes.
Long Valley monitoring program
In May 1980, just 1 week after the eruption at Mount St. Helens, a strong earthquake swarm occurred at Long Valley, California, site of a huge eruption of silicic magma about 700,000 years ago.
The most recent volcanic activity in the area resulted in the formation of lava domes 550 years ago, accompanied by phreatic explosions that blanketed much of eastern California and western Nevada with volcanic ash (Bailey and others, 1976; Miller, 1985).
Following the 1980 earthquakes, the USGS began monitoring Long Valley by setting up an observatory-like project operated from the USGS center in Menlo Park, California.
Studies conducted since 1980 have documented almost 2 feet of uplift of the ground within the Long Valley Caldera and have accurately located earthquakes occurring as swarms in and around the caldera, the most recent of which took place in 1990 and 1991.
The work at Long Valley is designed to monitor and interpret the current unrest and to make forecasts of any activity that might occur.
Thus, the Long Valley project effectively constitutes a fourth volcano observatory in function and responsibilities, if not in name.
The largest possible volcanic event at Long Valley, a catastrophic explosive eruption associated with renewed caldera collapse, is also the most difficult to forecast because of the long time interval between such eruptions and the absence of historically documented large caldera-forming eruptions anywhere in the world.

How Scientists Study Volcanoes
Taking A Volcano's Pulse
The three USGS volcano observatories and the Long Valley project have the following goals in common:
* Research directed toward understanding volcanic processes and products.
* Evaluation of the ongoing hazards posed by the active volcanoes.
* Delivery of warnings to public officials regarding these hazards.
To realize these goals, it is necessary to conduct visual and instrumental monitoring of volcanic activity.
Monitored changes common to each volcano include the following:
* Seismicity Earthquakes commonly provide the earliest warning of volcanic unrest, and earthquake swarms immediately precede most volcanic eruptions.
* Ground Movements Geodetic networks are set up to measure the changing shape of the volcano surface caused by the pressure of magma moving underground.
Techniques commonly used include electronic distance measurement using a laser light source (EDM); measurement of tilt, both electronically and by repeated leveling of triangular arrays; and standard leveling surveys to obtain elevation changes.
Additionally, very simple and inexpensive techniques, such as measuring crack openings using a steep tape, or noting changes in water level around a crater lake, have proven useful in certain situations.
Upward and outward movement of the ground above a magma storage area commonly occurs before eruption.
Localized ground displacement on steep volcanoes may indicate slope instability precursory to mass failure.
* Geophysical Properties Changes in electrical conductivity, magnetic field strength, and the force of gravity also trace magma movement.
These measurements may respond to magma movement even when no earthquakes or measurable ground deformation occurs.
* Gas Geochemistry Changes in fumarole gas composition, or in the emission rate of SO2 and other gases, may be related to variation in magma supply rate, change in magma type, or modifications in the pathways of gas escape induced by magma movement.
* Hydrologic Regime Changes in ground water temperature or level, rates of streamflow and transport of stream sediment, lake levels, and snow and ice accumulation are recorded to evaluate (1) the role of ground water in generating eruptions, (2) the potential hazards when hot, energetic volcanic products interact with snow, ice, and surface streams, and (3) the long-term hazard of infilling of river channels leading to increased flood potential.
Reconstructing a Volcano's History
Direct observations of volcanoes before, during, and after eruptions are essential to understanding a volcano's current behavior.
The following studies complement information gained from monitoring and allow specification of the entire history of activity at a given volcano or volcanic field.
* Geologic Mapping Geologic mapping places layered and more irregular deposits in the proper stratigraphic order and establishes their thickness and areal extent (and thus volume).
Field descriptions of stratigraphic units are used to classify deposits and interpret the type of eruption that produced them.
Mapping of ash deposits is used to correlate widely separated stratigraphic sections associated with a given volcano.
Dating of ash layers is especially valuable to bracket ages of other, less extensive, deposits in individual stratigraphic sections.
* Dating Dating of deposits establishes the time intervals in which eruptions or hydrologic events occurred.
Techniques commonly used for young deposits are:
* Carbon-14 This technique is used where eruptions overlie or incorporate vegetation or organic-rich soil and the carbon-bearing material is preserved.
* Tree Rings Traumatic injuries to trees are represented by interruption or distortion of growth rings.
In some cases, the season in which the event occurred can be specified based on knowledge of the yearly cycles of tree-ring growth.
* Paleomagnetism In some areas, it has been possible to calibrate yearly changes in the position of the Earth's magnetic pole over the past several hundreds or thousands of years.
In such cases the magnetic directions preserved in a series of eruptive deposits may be used to specify their approximate age.
Understanding Volcanic and Hydrologic Processes
Direct observation of volcanic and hydrologic events gives important but incomplete insights into the nature of volcano hazards.
The following topics represent some of the avenues pursued to gain a fuller understanding of volcanic processes that control hazardous events.
* Numerical Modeling Numerical modeling is used to test our understanding of physical processes, and hazard predictions can eventually be made on the basis of modeled events.
Volcano-related processes amenable to modeling include (1) the gravity-driven flow of lava, hot pyroclastic debris, landslide debris, water-saturated mixtures of mud and rock, and water floods; (2) the dispersal of volcanic ash plumes and thickness of ash accumulation on the ground; (3) the development of eruption- or landslide-induced waves; (4) the time of occurrence and magnitude of outbreak floods from lakes dammed by volcanic debris; and (5) the flow of groundwater and the dynamics of hydrothermal systems.
* Experimental Research Experimental research is necessary to model volcanic processes that cannot be studied directly or safely in the field or are too complicated to model numerically.
Experiments can be designed to simulate volcanic conditions and infer possible consequences of volcanic activity.
For example, a gelatin mold injected with a colored fluid mimics patterns of subsurface magma movement.
Specially designed flumes simulate the properties of dense slurries and help scientists to better understand the development and movement of debris flows.
Other topics, such as the origin of magmas by melting in the Earth's mantle, and their subsequent crystallization, can be studied by a combination of laboratory experiments, numerical modeling, and interpretation of chemical variation in erupted lavas.

A Volcano's History: Key to Assessment of Hazards
Any volcano is the sum total of past constructive and destructive processes, both volcanic and hydrologic, that have occurred over a period of time, usually thousands of years.
When the pattern, magnitude, and frequency of past events can be determined and evaluated in light of information gained by studying modern eruptions, reasonable predictions of futures activity can be made.
Thus, knowing a volcano's history is crucial to understanding its potential future behavior.
The essential link between the reconstruction of volcanic history and study of volcanic eruptions was recognized late in the 19th century.
In 1882, three years after the U.S. Geological Survey was founded, Clarence Dutton was asked to head a Division of Volcanic Geology within the USGS.
Dutton was sent to Hawaii "with the purpose of studying the features and processes of a volcano in action, and thus obtaining the practical knowledge which is essential to the investigation of extince volcanoes" (Dutton, 1884, p.xxvi).
The principal means of understanding a volcano's history are geologic mapping and dating of volcanic deposits whose stratigraphic positions are known.
Understanding the processes that produced the deposits depends on study of active volcanoes.
Eruption style and vigor can be determined for older deposits by matching a deposit produced during an observed volcanic event with a similar deposit in a geologic section.
By determining the kinds of eruption represented in a volcano's deposits, its eruption history can be reconstructed.
Once all or part of this eruption history is known, geologists can discern the patterns, if any, in its eruptive cycle.
Such patterns can help volcanologists to determine when a volcano may erupt again and the type of hazards expected from renewed eruption.
In all of the currently active volcanic areas in the United States, an effective collaboration is maintained between those who study active volcanism and those who study the prehistoric eruptions and fill in the eruptive history; many individuals do both.
In Hawaii, a new geologic map of the Island of Hawaii and its active volcanoes is being compiled (Wolfe and others) and a USGS general-interest publication on the volcanic and seismic hazards of the island has been published (Heliker, 1990).
Geologists mapping and dating deposits from individual volcanoes have produced a series of geologic hazard evaluations for volcanoes in the Cascade Range.
Teams of geologists and hydrologists at CVO are evaluating the past occurrence of debris avalanches, debris flows, and floods at a number of volcanoes, as well as carrying out research to better understand how these hydrologic hazards can be triggered and how they behave once triggered (Voight and others, 1983; Crandell and others, 1984; Pierson and Scott, 1985; Meyer and others, 1986; Laenen and Orzal, 1987; Siebert and others, 1987; Scott, 1988; Glicken and others, 1989; Major and Newhall, 1989; Pierson and others, 1990; Scott and others, 1990).
In Alaska, geologic mapping and hazard assessment are just beginning at the most hazardous volcanoes in the Cook Inlet area.
Studies are also being conducted at sites in the U.S. where seismic activity and ground deformation suggest the possibility of future eruptions.
Long Valley and Yellowstone Calderas in the continental interior are areas where recent geologic mapping has shown the occurrence of prehistoric volcanic activity widely ranging in scale from small basaltic eruptions, through explosive eruptions the size of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, to catastrophic caldera-forming eruptions of a magnitude never witnessed in recorded history (Bailey and others, 1976).
Both areas are seismically active and show episodic uplift of the ground surface; the seismic activity and geodetic changes are being closely monitored by USGS personnel supported under the Volcano Hazards Program (Dzurisin and others, 1990; Hill and others, 1990).
From the mapping and dating of volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits, geologists can determine the eruptive and mass-failure history for a given volcano, from which the nature, size, and frequency of previous hazardous events can be specified.
This history can then be used to predict the type and likelihood of future events.
The most common means by which a volcano's history and potential for future activity can be presented is a map outlining areas of risk from a particular kind of volcanic or hydrologic hazard.
The hazard zones must outline an area likely to be affected by a given kind of event and should also give some idea of the recurrence interval for that event (see Crandell and Mullineaux, 1975).
Thus, the criteria used to specify hazard zones must be based on the following:
1.
the type of activity (for example, debris flow, lava flow, ash fall), 2.
the magnitude of a typical event, expressed as the distance traveled or area covered, and 3.
the frequency of occurrence, as deduced from the historical and geologic record.
Maps have been prepared for several active volcanoes in the Cascade Range that outline the hazards from lava flows, pyroclastic flows, debris flows, and floods (Crandell and others, 1979).
The mapping and hazard assessment completed for Mount St. Helens in the 1970's resulted in publications (Crandell and others, 1975; Crandell and Mullineaux, 1978) that accurately forecast an eruption before the end of the century.
The May 1980 eruption impacted areas indicated as being at risk on a hazard map published in 1979 (Crandell and Mullineaux).
Another hazard-zone map depicting lava-flow hazards on the Island of Hawaii has recently been published (Heliker, 1990).
Hazard-zone maps are perhaps the most easily understandable information that public officials and ordinary citizens can use in planning for volcanic emergencies.
Maps combining information on land classification with the volcanic history of an area and the associated hazards also form the basis for prudent land-use planning and preparation for the contingency of eruptions far into the future.
__________________________________________________________________
Hazard-Zone Maps and Volcanic Risk
[map_ruiz_hazard_zones.gif] The purpose of hazard-zone maps is to give accurate information on the type and frequency of volcanic eruptions and consequent volcanic and hydrologic processes that could impact a give area -- information vital to sound land-use planning.
In 1951, two decades before the first comprehensive hazard assessment for volcanoes in Hawaii, a developer could have felt secure in placing a subdivision on Kilauea's lower east rift zone knowing that: (1) Kilauea had not erupted at all fro the past 17 years, and (2) Kilauea had not erupted on its lower east rift zone since 1840, more than a century of inactivity.
Such time periods are long by human standards and commonly influence judgment in land-use decisions.
But he would have made a mistake.
Kilauea became active again, at its summit, in 1952 and over the succeeding 38 years there were 13 separate east rift eruptions, two of which persisted longer than 4 years.
From the first return of activity at the lower east rift zone in 1955 to the present, almost 30 percent of the land surface between the rift zone and a 51-kilometer stretch of coastline has been covered by lava.
Geologic mapping and dating of volcanic deposits at Kilauea form the basis for an astonishing statistic -- over 90 percent of the land surface of Kilauea has been covered by lava since the time of arrival of the Hawaiians, about 1,500 years ago.
Had the developer been made aware of the entire history of Kilauea's activity, the risk of developing the east rift zone would have been understood to be higher than could be inferred from just considering the record of the preceding 111 years.
The 123-year period of inactivity at Mount St. Helens also created a false sense of security regarding future activity.
however, in this case, a hazard assessment was made in 1978 which correctly inferred an end to the period of repose and alerted people to the possibility of renewed activity.
Armero, Colombia, 1995 lahar devastation from Nevado del Ruiz Volcano The 1985 Ruiz eruption offers another, much more tragic example of the need to understand the entire history of a volcano in assessing hazards.
The town of Armero, Colombia -- buried by mudflows triggered by the 1985 eruption at Nevado del Ruiz -- was located on a debris fan that was overrun by destructive mudflows in the year 1595, shortly after the arrival of the Spanish colonists, and again in 1845, killing hundreds of people in each instance.
During the ensuing 140-year period of inactivity, people forgot and the town was rebuilt at the same site and grew in population.
Although a preliminary hazard-zone map for Ruiz, completed one month before the November 1985 eruption, clearly delineated Armero as being especially vulnerable to mudflows, emergency-response measures taken during the eruption were entirely inadequate to save the more than 23,000 lives lost when the mudflows struck.
__________________________________________________________________
The Challenge of Predicting Eruptions
A primary goal of the Volcano Hazards Program is forecasting and predicting eruptions.
Several increasingly specific and useful steps lead toward prediction (See: "How Scientists Study Volcanoes").
Initially, when little is known about the past history and preeruption behavior of a volcano, we may only be able to give factual information about current unrest; for example, that swarms of small earthquakes are occurring beneath the volcano, similar to those which have preceded eruptions elsewhere.
When the average repose period and other information regarding a particular volcano's eruptions, for example, when the amount of inflation preceding the previous eruption is matched by current conditions at that volcano, a general forecast can be made that the volcano is "ready" to erupt.
The start of microearthquakes or other common eruption precursors would lead to an updated forecast -- that the volcano may erupt soon.
In the past, forecasts of eruptions were based solely on recurring patterns of unrest before eruptions.
The occurrence of one particularly diagnostic type of unrest, for example, volcanic tremor, might be the basis for a prediction that the volcano would erupt within a specified number of hours or days.
The appearance of other known eruption precursors helped narrow the time window and lent certainty to the prediction.
We now recognize the need to understand why particular patterns and events occur before some eruptions, and this need requires a thorough physical understanding of the volcano's internal plumbing and the processes associated with the generation, transport, storage, and ultimately, eruption of magma.
For example, a combination of seismic and geodetic data demonstrates the existence of a complex magma reservoir 2 to 6 kilometers beneath Kilauea's summit from which all eruptions on the volcano ultimately originate.
Earthquake foci outline the area of magma storage, whereas horizontal, vertical, and tilt changes above the reservoir define the depth to "centers" of inflation (swelling) or deflation.
Understanding of this storage system has greatly improved the ability to determine when Kilauea is fully inflated and ready to erupt.
Accurate short-term (within days to weeks) prediction of Hawaiian eruptions remains elusive, as both Kilauea and Mauna Loa may reach a highly inflated state, and wait with no further ground deformation or increase in seismicity until eruptions occurs.
some Kilauea rift eruptions are preceded within hours by a strong earthquake swarm whose foci migrate toward the point of outbreak, giving a short but accurate prediction of this type of activity.
Volcano monitoring, combined with study of Kilauea's volcanic history, yields the information necessary for long-term eruptions forecasts.
As with Hawaiian eruptions, the dome-building eruptions of Mount St. Helens are not predictable many months ahead.
Prediction of dome-building eruptions were made, however, within days or weeks, using very simple methods, with relatively little prior knowledge or understanding of the volcano's plumbing system.
Accurate predictions are still rare in volcanology, and probabilities associated with eruption from a given volcanic system may change after an eruption takes place.
Often volcanic systems are in delicate balance and may be considered "ready" to erupt; this determination of readiness allows a medium-range forecast of increased likelihood of eruption.
For many currently dormant but potentially active volcanoes, we may only be able to give factual information regarding past activity without specifying what the future holds.
For well-studied, historically active volcanoes we can make more specific forecasts of future activity.
The most accurate predictions are in the short-term where either rapid ground movements or an earthquake swarm directly precedes eruption at the surface.
__________________________________________________________________
Predictions, Forecasts, and Factual Statements
The terms forecast and prediction are often used inter-changeable, and both confused with simple factual statements regarding past occurrence of eruptions.
Herein, the following distinctions are made:
A factual statement describes current conditions but does not anticipate future events.
Mauna Loa erupted 35 times in the past 200 years, and the last large debris flow from Mount Rainier was 500 years ago are two examples of factual statements.
The accumulation and analysis of such factual information form the basis for forecasts and predictions.
A forecast is a comparatively imprecise statement of the time, place, and ideally, the nature and size of impending activity.
For example, Mauna Loa is likely to erupt at its summit within the next five years, as determined from the rate of reinflation and historical eruptive patterns.
A prediction is a relatively precise statement giving the time and place of eruptions and measurements of ongoing monitoring results and only secondarily on a projection of past history.
For example, on the basis of accelerated movement of thrust faults on the crater floor, the next eruption of Mount St. Helens will occur in the summit crater between March 17 and March 20 and will be a dome-building event.
Volcanologists strive to make accurate predictions, although most often a forecast is the most reliable statement that can be made, given the available data and technology.
In areas already developed or proposed for development, all three types of information can be used both for land-use planning and as a basis for developing procedures to ensure public safety in anticipation of a volcanic eruption.

Communicating Research Results and Hazards Information
For information derived from the Volcano Hazards Program to be of maximum benefit, it must be communicated in ways that can be easily and directly applied in the reduction of volcanic disasters.
Such communication can take place in two ways:
* Working directly with local officials responsible for public safety before, during, and immediately after volcanic erutpions or damaging hydrologic events.
Information on anticipated or actual volcanic hazards is used to guide decisions on closing and reopening of roads or recreational areas and evacuating people.
* Providing background information on volcanic hazards to local jurisdictions, including planners, developers, public safety officials, and current and potential residents, for the dual purpose of supporting informed decisions regarding land use and encouraging adequate planning for future volcanic crises.
In working directly with public officials, the means of communication is generally face-to-face or by telephone.
Discussions in anticipation of volcanic activity may result in adoption of hazard-mitigation strategies such as warning systems or a hierarchy of alert levels.
These are activated according to information acquired and delivered by the USGS prior to or during a volcanic emergency.
Ongoing communication with public officials is an essential part of the operation of each volcano observatory, and it is a task taken on by the other USGS offices for restless volcanoes away from the observatory sites.
The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has developed an informal and effective communication with the National Park Service and Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency, the two agencies on the Island of Hawaii responsible for public safety.
The Cascades Volcano Observatory delivers warnings of activity at Mount St. Helens in a more complex setting, where information on volcanic hazards is delivered to many agencies at the Federal, State, county, and local levels (see Peterson, 1988).
This communication also has been effective and serves as a model for dealing with the many other Cascades volcanoes that have erupted in the not-too-distant past and that could erupt again.
The Alaska Volcano Observatory also has to respond to and communicate with a different mix of agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
In recent years, tragedies have nearly occurred because of temporary engine failures when commercial jetliners flew into ash plumes.
The need to issue timely warnings to aircraft has led to development of a system of sensors that detect ash clouds and lightning originating from them, as well as wind speed and direction.
The USGS's ability to effectively communicate information about potential future volcanic activity has been put to its greatest test at Long Valley, where the end result of ongoing unrest is difficult to forecast and where negative economic consequences of that information were anticipated or experienced.
Nonetheless, in all of the areas marked by volcanic unrest, the goal of the Volcano Hazards Program remains that of keeping the public apprised as to the likelihood of eruption and the hazards that would be posed.
The USGS publishes hazard assessments, including hazard-zone maps, and general-interest publications on volcanic phenomena.
Booklets describing volcano hazards in lay terms, some of which are accompanied by hazard-zone maps, are available for several volcanic areas.
...
Other activities, conducted in noncrisis atmosphere, are media briefings on volcanic processes and their associated hazards, local forums to discuss the hazards of a specific area, or meetings with public officials responsible for long-range planning at which USGS scientists are invited to provide hazards information.

Danger in the Stratosphere: Aircraft and Volcanic Plumes
During the past 14 years, there have been 23 incidents involving aircraft that have inadvertently encountered eruption plumes.
Apart from windshield pitting resulting in loss of visibility, the most common result is engine damage that occurs when volcanic ash enters the jet intakes; the volcanic ash melts and coats turbine blades, often causing the engines to stall.
Fortunately, in all past cases, engines have restarted, but only after severe loss of altitude.
Most recently a Boeing 747 aircraft lost power in all four of its engines after encountering the plume of the explosive eruption of Redoubt Volcano on December 15, 1989; it glided without power from 8,534 meters (28,000 feet) until engines were restarted at 4,267 meters (14,000 feet), only 1,219 meters (4,000 feet) above nearby mountain peaks.
The airliner landed safely in Anchorage and no one was hurt, but the damage to the aircraft has been estimated to exceed $80 million (Steenblik, 1990).
Personnel from the Volcano Hazards Program, particularly those at the Alaska Volcano Observatory, are working with officials of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop automatic early warning systems for large ash clouds and to streamline communication for eruptions at U.S. volcanoes that might impact aircraft.
Other countries have developed or are developing similar procedures, assisted in part by the World Organization of Volcano Observatories and coordinated through the International Civil Aviation Organization.
__________________________________________________________________
Public acceptance of volcano-hazard information as a necessary component of land-use planning and decisionmaking is much more difficult to achieve than is the coordination of response during a volcanic emergency.
The USGS is empowered only to communicate information, not to recommend how that information is to be used.
Acting on hazard information provided by the USGS requires that public agencies recognize the difference between hazard and risk.
Public officials must make the often difficult assessment of what is an acceptable risk.
Many, if not most, areas prone to eruption hazards are already developed to the extent that mitigation rather than prevention of volcanic destruction is the most that can be hoped for.
Lives can be saved, however, by a combination of a well-informed populace, an ongoing effective interaction between scientists and local officials, and timely warnings of imminent eruption and associated hazards.
__________________________________________________________________
Hazard, Risk, and Acceptable Risk
The terms hazard and risk, often used interchangeably, are defined herein as follows:
Hazard: an event or process that is potentially destructive.
Risk: the magnitude of a potential loss -- of life, property, or productive capacity -- within the area subject to hazard(s).
The threat by volcano hazards is a function of those natural processes and can be viewed as constant, whether or not lives and property are in jeopardy.
Degree of risk, by contrast, is directly tied to the scale and value of human activity in the path of potential hazards.
Options for controlling volcanic hazards are limited: most volcanic events cannot be modified by humans.
However, much can be done to minimize volcanic risk -- by prudent land use, timely warnings, and community preparedness.
Acceptable risk is that which individuals, businesses, or governments are willing to accept in return for perceived benefits.
The level of acceptable risk is usually defined by local governments, taking into account information on volcanic hazards and combining it with economic, social, and polititcal factors specific to the area threatened.
In some situations risks will be judged acceptable without special precautions.
In other situations local governments can take action to reduce the rist to acceptable levels, such as zoning to control population density, or restricting placement of critical facilities (for example, hospitals) in areas judged to be threatened.
The consequences of imperfect communication or ineffective interaction between scientists and public officials can be extremely serious.
Severe economic hardship and social disruption can result from either an actual hazard that is not perceived, or from a hazard that is blown out of proportion and made to seem worse than it is.
A dependable communication link -- between the scientific personnel responsible for making hazards evaluations and the news media -- must transmit information in an accurate and timely fashion.
For example, the Cascades Volcano Observatory assigned a public information officer to their staff while volcanic activity continued at Mount St. Helens to ensure consistency of information delivered to public officials and the media.
Ultimately, effective coexistence with volcanoes requires difficult and sometimes controversial compromises to be made between the economic pressures to develop land for commercial and residential use, and the need to set aside areas of highest volcanic hazard for wilderness, recreation, or other low-density use.
Thoughtful land-use planning serves in the long run to lessen the risks to the local populace in the event of a volcanic eruption.

Meeting the Demands for Global Volcano Hazards Reduction
A volcanologist's laboratory is the world's volcanoes.
Although U.S. volcanoes are an important part of that laboratory, none except Kilauea erupts frequently enough for the laboratory to be "open" at all times, and processes at Kilauea differ markedly from those of the more dangerous, but less active, explosive volcanoes of the Cascades and Alaska.
Only 2 to 3 volcanoes erupt each year in the U.S., most in remote locations in Alaska, in contrast to 50 to 60 worldwide.
Participation in investigations at volcanoes abroad provides a practical way to study more eruptions in the larger laboratory, from which new scientific insights can be applied to U.S. volcanoes.
In turn, well-studied U.S. eruptions such as that at Mount St. Helens offer insights that can be applied to similar volcanoes worldwide.
Cooperative international programs in volcanology also offer the opportunity of sharing information on volcano-monitoring techniques.
Assistance to Developing Countries
Most of the world's high-risk volcanoes are in developing countries whose growing populations are rapidly encroaching on these volcanoes.
This encroachment has greatly increased the vulnerability of communities and economies to devastation from volcanic eruptions and associated hazards.
At present, few of these nations have the capability to assess volcanic histories to the degree that would allow them to accurately assess future potential hazards.
The USGS, through the Volcano Hazards Program, assumes a professional responsibility to assist foreign colleagues who seek to expand their own volcano-hazards expertise.
Technical assistance missions fulfill this responsibility and, in return, afford us the opportunity to study many more active volcanoes than otherwise possible.
U.S. scientists can gain valuable experience during overseas volcano crises, and they can join foreign colleagues in working to find simple, low-cost solutions to problems of volcano monitoring and hazard assessment.

A Volcanic Disaster Averted in the Philippines
1991 Eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines On April 2, 1991, people from the village of Patal Pinto, on the Philippine Island of Luzon, saw small explosions followed by steaming and the smell of rotten eggs (H2S gas) coming from the upper slopes of Mount Pinatubo, a dormant volcano whose last known eruption was 600 years ago.
Thus began the unrest that within 10 weeks led to one of the largest 20th century eruptions.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) immediately installed portable seismometers near the mountain and began recording several hundred earthquakes a day.
At the request of PHIVOLCS, made through the USAID office in Manila, U.S.Geological Survey personnel arrived on April 23.
Within 2 weeks the team of Philippine and American volcanologists had installed a radio-telemetered seismic network capable of locating the increasing number of earthquakes.
They began tape measurements across fractures opened during the early steam explosions, and they later installed tiltmeters to detect new ground movement.
With the help of the U.S.Air Force, measurements of the SO2 content of gas in the steam plumes, now continuously visible at Pinatubo, were begun.
Between May 13 and May 28, a 10-fold rise in SO2 content was measured.
All signals indicated that magma was rising within the volcano.
Meanwhile, Philippine and American geologists made a geological reconnaissance of the volcano and established a set of alert levels ranging form 1 (low-level unrest) to 5 (eruption underway).
When the alert system was completed on May 13, the level was set at 2 meaning that magma was probably involved in the unrest.
The geological reconnaissance showed the dominant lava products were dacite domes near the summit and valley-filling pyroclastic flows extending radially out from the summit to a distance of 10 to 15 kilometers.
Small villages on the volcano's northwest slope and part of Clark Air Base lay within the potential range of pyroclastic flows.
Numerous communities, including the city of Angeles with a population of 300,000 lay within the apron of debris flows extending well beyond the volcano.
A hazard map was prepared and distributed to local officials by May 23 showing virtually all of the hazards subsequently encountered when Pinatubo erupted.
Seismic activity escalated in early June, and on June 5 PHIVOLCS raised the alert level to 3 -- eruption possible within 2 weeks.
A small dome extruded on the north flank on June 7 accompanied by thousands of small earthquakes triggering a level 4 alert -- explosive eruption possible within 24 hours.
Continuous ash emission began, and 2 days later PHIVOLCS raised the alert level to 5 signifying an eruption had begun.
Clark Air Base was evacuated on June 10.
On June 12, the first of several major explosions took place, sending airborne ash to the west and pyroclastic flows down the northwest slope of the volcano.
Areas potentially impacted by the pyroclastic flows had been evacuated in response to the level 3 alert.
The city of Angeles was put on evacuation alert.
A climactic eruption took place on June 15 during passage of a typhoon, which had already resulted in closure of the International Airport at Manila.
The typhoon compounded the effects of the eruption by generating mudflows in addition to ash fall and greatly hampering evacuation efforts.
By June 16 when the weather cleared, the top of the volcano was gone, replaced by a 2-kilometer-wide caldera, and pyroclastic flow deposits had largely filled preexisting valleys on all sectors of the volcano.
Ash had fallen over a vast area beyond the volcano.
The weight of the thick blanket of heavy, water-saturated ash combined with continued felt earthquakes resulted in the collapse of many buildings in Philippine cities and villages as well as on Clark Air Base and the more distant Subic Bay Naval Base.
The ash reached thicknesses of 30 centimeters as far as 40 kilometers away from the volcano.
Following the climactic eruption, continuous ash emission at a lower level continues at this writing (July 1991).
Loss of life in the Pinatubo eruption was remarkably low, given the size of the eruption -- 350 people died, mostly in buildings that collapsed.
The alert system put in place by PHIVOLCS combined with effective communication among the USGS, PHIVOLCS, local civil defense agencies, and the U.S.Military Command prevented a much greater human disaster.
The scientific information necessary to guide the alerts was gathered by USGS and Philippine geologists working side by side, each complementing the others' expertise in order to turn potential disaster into a responsibly handled volcanic emergency.
As an exercise in both eruption prediction and effective response, the 1991 Pinatubo eruption provides and important model for future situations in which dormant volcanoes come to life.

A Look Toward the Future
The 1990's have been designated the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR).
The USGS, as an active participant in the IDNDR Program, recognizes several challenges to both our understanding of volcanic activity and to our ability to communicate scientific results in a way that can be used by communities facing volcanic hazards.
We list below a representative list of challenges that can be met during the 1990's, listed under five important elements of the Volcano Hazards Program.
* Eruption Prediction * Volcano Hazards Assessment * Research in Volcano Processes * Effective Communication * Working in the World Laboratory __________________________________________________________________
Epilog
Even with anticipated technological advances in the 1990's, the work of the Volcano Hazards Program will continue to be people-intensive.
Geologic and hydrologic fieldwork necessary for hazards mapping, and the interpretation of monitoring data cannot be done by sophisticated instruments or computer software alone, nor can a GIS printout substitute for human interaction and judgment during a volcanic crisis.
We also recognize the need to develop simple, low-cost, and rugged ("low-tech") instruments and techniques that complement the increasingly sophisticated and expensive "high-tech" approaches.
Volcanoes with their eruptions and other related hazards have long been regarded in this country as exotic phenomena found only in remote corners of the world.
In 1980 when Mount St. Helens demonstrated a wide spectrum of nature's fury that perception changed dramatically.
Now that we have (1) a much better understanding of hazardous processes at volcanoes, (2) new advances in monitoring and computer technology, and (3) the fresh awareness of what volcanoes can do in the minds of scientific exchange, the 1990's are ripe for significant progress in reaching the goals of the Volcano Hazards Program.
The USGS is ready to meet the ongoing challenge of understanding volcanic hazards to mitigate and, when possible, prevent volcanic disasters.
