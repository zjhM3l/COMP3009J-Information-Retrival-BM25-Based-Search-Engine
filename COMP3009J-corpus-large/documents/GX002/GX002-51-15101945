The environmental effects of acid rain include the acidification of lakes and streams, damage to trees at high altitude, the acceleration of decay in buildings and poorer air quality.
Acid Rain also poses serious human health risks by contributing to heart and lung disorders such as asthma and bronchitis.
Through the Acid Rain Program and other Clean Air initiatives, the EPA monitors and seeks to reduce the effects of acid rain by regulating industrial emissions and advocating energy efficiency alternatives and pollution prevention programs.
Recommended EPA Web pages * U.S. EPA Acid Rain Program Homepage The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX), the primary causes of acid rain.
* Effects of Acid Rain Document addresses environmental effects of acid rain.
* Technical Document: EPA's Draft Report on the Environment 2003: 1.2: Acid Deposition SO2 and NOx emissions react with water, oxygen, and oxidants to form acid deposition.
