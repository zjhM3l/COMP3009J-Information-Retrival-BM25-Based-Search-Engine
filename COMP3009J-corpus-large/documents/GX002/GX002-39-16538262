Investigation and Building Background
1.
Introduce term:
Students have little knowledge of nuclear reactors and limited understanding of the terminology used in nuclear power plants.
Definitions found in dictionaries tend to be vague reguarding this specialized language.
2.
School resources:
Basic Text, "Nuclear Power and Radiation," Workshop Manual, U.S. NRC, Office of Public Affairs.
3.
Generalizing:
The purpose of a nuclear power plant is to produce or release heat and boil water.
It is designed to produce electricity.
It should be noted that while there are significant differences, there are many similarities between nuclear power plants and other electrical generating facilities.
Uranium is used for fuel in nuclear powerplants to make electricity.

Lesson Plan
Greeting...
Increasingly, our country has become a nation of electricity users.
We depend on an abundant affordable supply of energy to power the many machines we use in our complex society.
Can you imagine what it would be like not having electricity in your home? About one-third of our energy resources are used to produce electricity.
Electricity can be produced in many ways -- most of which you already know about.
Today, we're going to talk about one of those ways -- nuclear fission.
In America, nuclear energy plants are the second largest source of electricity after coal -producing approximately 21 percent of our electricity.
There is something I want all of you to be aware of and that is the purpose of a nuclear power plant is to produce electricity.
Accordingly, while nuclear power plants have many similarities to other types of electricity generating plants, there are some significant differences.
With the exception of solar, wind, and hydroelectric plants all others including nuclear convert water to steam which spins the propeller like blades of a turbine which spins the shaft of a generator.
Inside the generator coils of wire and magnetic fields interact to create electricity.
[Turbine/Generator]
The energy needed to boil water into steam is produced in one of two ways -- by burning coal, oil, or gas (fossil fuels) in a furnace or by splitting certain atoms of uranium in a nuclear energy plant.
Nothing is burned or exploded in a nuclear energy plant.
Rather, the uranium fuel generates heat through a process called fission.
What Is Fission? Where Does it Take Place?
Uranium is an element that can be found in the crust of the earth.
This element, quite abundant in many areas of the world, is naturally radioactive.
Certain isotopes of uranium can be used as fuel in a nuclear power plant.
The uranium is formed into ceramic pellets about the size of the end of your finger.
[Reactor Fuel Assembly] These pellets are inserted into long, vertical tubes (fuel rods) within the reactor.
The reactor is the heart of the nuclear power plant.
Basically, it is a machine that heats water.
A reactor has four main parts: 1) the uranium fuel assemblies, 2) the control rods, 3) the coolant/moderator, and 4) the pressure vessel.
The fuel assemblies, control rods, and coolant/moderator make up what is known as the reactor core.
The core is surrounded by the pressure vessel.
[Franklin's Core]
We also have to understand that uranium cannot just be thrown into a reactor the way we shovel coal into a furnace.
The fuel rods, containing the uranium, are carefully bound together into fuel assemblies, each of which contains about 240 rods.
The assemblies hold the rods apart so that when they are submerged into the reactor core, water can flow between them.
When the uranium atom splits, it releases energy and two or more neutrons from its nucleus.
These neutrons can then hit the nuclei of other uranium atoms causing them to fission.
The sequence of one fission triggering others, and those triggering still more, is called a chain reaction.
When the atoms split, they release energy in the form of heat.
[Chain reaction] The heat is transferred from the reactor core to the steam generator.
Here, it's converted to high pressure steam which turns the turbine in the electric generator.
[Turbine/Generator]
This next transparency shows the basic design of the nuclear fuel steam plant and its various components.
[Nuclear Power Plant]
In the past few minutes I've introduced several new terms.
Let me explain what each means in the energy generating process.
First, control rods.
What are they? How are they used?
The control rods slide up and down in between the fuel assemblies in the reactor core.
They control or regulate the speed of the nuclear reaction by absorbing neutrons.
Here's how it works.
When the control rods absorb neutrons, fewer neutrons hit the uranium atoms thus slowing down the chain reaction.
On the other hand, when the core temperature goes down, the control rods are slowly lifted out of the core, and fewer neutrons are absorbed.
Therefore, more neutrons are available to cause fission.
This releases more heat energy.
Just as there are many different types of houses and cars, there are different types of nuclear power plants that generate electricity
.
The two basic types being used in the United States are the Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) and the Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR).
These power plants are often referred to as light water reactors.

[Pass out Activities 4 - Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) 
Boiling Water Reactor (BWR)
The boiling water reactor operates in essentially the same way as a fossil-fuel generating plant.
Neither of these types of power plants have a steam generator.
Instead, water in the BWR boils inside the pressure vessel and the steam water mixture is produced when very pure water (reactor coolant) moves upward through the core absorbing heat.
The water boils and produces steam.
When the steam rises to the top of the pressure vessel, water droplets are removed, the steam is sent to the turbine generator to turn the turbine.
[BWR schematic]
Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)
The pressurized water reactor differs from the BWR in that the steam to run the turbine is produced in a steam generator.
Water boils at 212Ã¯Â¿Â½F or 100Ã¯Â¿Â½C.
If a lid is tightly placed over a pot of boiling water (a pressure cooker), the pressure inside the pot will increase because the steam cannot escape.
As the pressure increases, so does the temperature of the water in the pot.
In the PWR plant, a pressurizer unit keeps the water that is flowing through the reactor vessel under very high pressure to prevent it from boiling.
The hot water then flows into the steam generator where it is converted to steam.
The steam passes through the turbine which produces electricity.
About two thirds of the reactor power plants in the U.S. are of the PWR type.

Answers to Questions from "Nuclear Reactors/energy Generation" Unit Outline: 1.
Q: Is there a nuclear powerplant near where you live? What type is it? A: Example: 40 miles south of Annapolis, MD -- Calvert Cliffs 1
2.
Q: Why don't boiling water reactors have steam generators? A: Because the water is boiled inside the pressure vessel and the steam is used directly to turn the turbine.
3.
Q: What is the purpose of a "cooling tower?" A: To remove excess heat from the reactor circulating water system.
4.
Q: What percentage of our electricity in the U.S. is produced in nuclear power plants? A: Approximately 20 percent (20%).
5.
Q: Name the two types of reactor power plants in operation the U.S.
What are the basic differences? A: a.
Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) -- water is boiled in the pressure vessel and the steam is used directly to turn the turbine.
b. Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) -- water flows through a steam generator where it is heated to produce steam which then flows to the turbine to generate electricity.
