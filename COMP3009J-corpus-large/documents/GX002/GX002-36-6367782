It lists the actions most identity theft victims should take to limit the damage done by the thief.
Use the contact logs at the end of the checklist to keep a record of all your contacts with credit bureaus, creditors and others.
Keep copies of all the letters you send and receive.
For more information, see the web sites of the Federal Trade Commission (http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/), the Identity Theft Resource Center (www.idtheftcenter.org), the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (www.privacyrights.org), and the Department of Consumer Affairs (www.dca.ca.gov).
[wedge.gif] Report the fraud to the three major credit bureaus.
Ask each of the credit bureaus to flag your file with a "fraud alert."
Also, ask them to add a victim's statement to your credit report.
The victim's statement tells creditors to call you to get your approval if they receive requests to open new accounts.
Give them a phone number to use to contact you.
Ask each credit bureau for a free copy of your credit report.
As a victim of identity theft, you have the right to a free report from each credit bureau.
For more on what to tell the credit bureaus, see "Identity Theft: What to Do When It Happens to You" at www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs17a.htm.
[wedge.gif] Report the crime to the police.
Under California law, you can report identity theft to your local police department.
Ask the police to issue a police report of identity theft.
You may have to show copies of the laws to the police.
The laws are on the last pages of this information sheet.
Give the police as much information on the theft as possible.
Give them any new evidence you collect to add to your report.
Be sure to get a copy of your police report.
You will need to give copies to creditors and the credit bureaus.
For more information, see "Organizing Your Identity Theft Case" by the Identity Theft Resource Center, available at http://www.idtheftcenter.org/html/fs106.htm.
[wedge.gif] Request information on fraudulent accounts.
When you file your police report of identity theft, the officer may give you forms to use to request account information from credit grantors.
If the officer does not do this, you can use the forms available from the Office of Privacy Protection at www.privacyprotection.ca.gov/howto530.8.htm.
Send copies of the forms to all creditors where the thief opened or applied for accounts, along with copies of the police report as described below.
Give the information you receive from creditors to the officer investigating your case.
[wedge.gif] Call creditors.
Call all creditors for any accounts that the thief opened or used.
When you call, ask for the security or fraud department.
Creditors can be credit card companies, other lenders, phone companies, other utility companies, and department stores.
Tell them you are an identity theft victim.
Ask them not to hold you responsible for charges the thief made.
Ask them to close those accounts and to report them to credit bureaus as "closed at consumer's request."
If you open new accounts, have them set up to require a password or PIN to approve use.
Don't use your mother's maiden name or the last four numbers of your Social Security number as your password.
For more information on what to tell creditors, see the "Identity Theft: What to Do When It Happens to You," available at www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs17a.htm and the Federal Trade Commission's "When Bad Things Happen to Your Good Name," available at www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/idtheft.htm.

Look for accounts opened in your name that you did not open.
Also, look for charges to your accounts that you did not make.
And look for late payments or non-payments that are not yours.
Check your name, address and Social Security number.
Look at the Inquiries section of the report.
Ask the credit bureaus to remove any inquiries from companies holding fraudulent accounts in your name.
Ask each credit bureau to remove all information in your credit report that results from the theft.
Order new credit reports every three months until your situation has cleared up.
You may have to pay $8 for each report after the first free one.
[wedge.gif] Use the ID Theft Affidavit.
The Federal Trade Commission's ID Theft Affidavit is a form that can help you clear up your records.
The Affidavit is accepted by the credit bureaus and by many major creditors.
Send copies of the completed form to creditors where the thief opened accounts in your name.
Also send copies to creditors where the thief made charges on your account, to the credit bureaus, and to the police.
The form is available on the FTC web site at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/affidavit.pdf.
[wedge.gif] Write to the credit bureaus.
Write a letter to each credit bureau.

[wedge.gif] If your driver's license or DMV-issued ID card was stolen...
Immediately contact your local DMV office to report the theft.
Ask them to put a fraud alert on your license.
Then call the toll-free DMV Fraud Hotline at 866-658-5758.
If the thief is using your license as ID, you may want to change your license number.
Ask DMV for an appointment.
Take a copy of the police report and copies of bills or other items supporting your claim of fraud.
You will also need to prove your identity.
Take current documents such as a passport, a certification of citizenship or naturalization, or a U.S. military photo ID. DMV will issue a new driver's license or ID card number when you meet all the requirements.
For more information, see "Identity Theft: Have You Been A Victim of Identity Theft? DMV Can Help," available at www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/brochures/fast_facts/ffdl24.htm.
[wedge.gif] If your mail was stolen or your address changed by the identity thief...
Notify the Postal Inspector if you think the identity thief has stolen your mail or filed a change of address request in your name.
To find your nearest Postal Inspector, look in the white pages of the telephone book for the Post Office listing under United States Government.

In the case of a false civil judgment, contact the court where the judgment was entered.
Report that you are a victim of identity theft.
In the case of a false criminal judgment, contact the California Department of Justice at 888-880-0240 and the FBI.

Say that you dispute the validity of the debt.
Say that you did not create the debt and are not responsible for it.
Send the collector a follow-up letter saying the same things.
Include a copy of your police report and of any documents you've received from the creditor.
Write that your letter gives notice to a claimant under California Civil Code section 1798.93(c)(5) that a situation of identity theft exists.
Send the letter by certified mail, return receipt requested.
If the debt collector is not the original creditor, send your letter within 30 days of receiving the collector's first written demand for payment.
[wedge.gif] A word about your Social Security number ...
Sometimes, an identity thief will use the victim's Social Security number to be able to work.
It's a good idea to check your Social Security earnings record to see if the thief is using your Social Security number.
You can get a copy of your earnings record by calling 1-800-772-1213.
Or get a Request for Social Security Statement (Form 7004) at http://www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-7004.pdf.

(c) In any case in which a person willfully obtains personal identifying information of another person, uses that information to commit a crime in addition to a violation of subdivision (a), and is convicted of that crime, the court records shall reflect that the person whose identity was falsely used to commit the crime did not commit the crime.
(d) Every person who, with the intent to defraud, acquires, transfers, or retains possession of the personal identifying information, as defined in subdivision (b), of another person is guilty of a public offense, and upon conviction therefor, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, or a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.
Penal Code Section 530.6: Police Jurisdiction and Expedited Judicial Action 530.6.
(a) A person who has learned or reasonably suspects that his or her personal identifying information has been unlawfully used by another, as described in subdivision (a) of Section 530.5, may initiate a law enforcement investigation by contacting the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over his or her actual residence, which shall take a police report of the matter, provide the complainant with a copy of that report, and begin an investigation of the facts or, if the suspected crime was committed in a different jurisdiction, refer the matter to the law enforcement agency where the suspected crime was committed for an investigation of the facts.
(b) A person who reasonably believes that he or she is the victim of identity theft may petition a court, or the court, on its own motion or upon application of the prosecuting attorney, may move, for an expedited judicial determination of his or her factual innocence, where the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested for, cited for, or convicted of a crime under the victim's identity, or where a criminal complaint has been filed against the perpetrator in the victim's name, or where the victim's identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction.
Any judicial determination of factual innocence made pursuant to this section may be heard and determined upon declarations, affidavits, police reports, or other material, relevant, and reliable information submitted by the parties or ordered to be part of the record by the court.
Where the court determines that the petition or motion is meritorious and that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the victim committed the offense for which the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, convicted, or subject to a criminal complaint in the victim's name, or that the victim's identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, the court shall find the victim factually innocent of that offense.
