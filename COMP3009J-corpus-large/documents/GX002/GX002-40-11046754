Jefferson was elected third president of the United States and served two terms, from 1801-1809.
james madison James Madison (1751-1836): Madison was a moving force behind the Constitutional requirement for regular, periodic censuses, and explained the need for such a measure in The Federalist Papers.
He urged using the census to collect data on the military and economic potential of the Nation.
As our fourth president, he expanded the 1801 census to include items on occupation and "manufactures."
Ironically, Madison's name does not appear on the 1790 census records.
Only the names of heads of households were listed, and Madison lived in his father's household at that time.
Madison was elected fourth president of the United States and served two terms, from 1809 - 1817.
joseph c. g. kennedy Joseph C.G. Kennedy (1813-1887): As superintendent of the 1850 and 1860 censuses, Kennedy introduced major innovations in the census, consulting with statisticians and scholars on data content, using specialized census schedules (questionnaires) to cover specific demographic and economic areas, producing statistical maps for each state and county, and centralizing census data processing to improve control and efficiency.
These changes laid the foundation for future censuses in the United States.
Kennedy also was a vigorous proponent of a permanent statistical office for the federal government.
Dr. John Shaw Billings (1838 - 1913): He began work on the 1880 census with a pioneer study of vital statistics.
While involved with this effort, he met Herman Hollerith and proposed mechanizing the compilation of census data.
Later, he was instrumental in the adoption of the Hollerith tabulating equipment for processing the 1890 census.
Billings was a distinguished surgeon, hygienist, educator (he developed Johns Hopkins University medical curriculum) bibliographer, museum curator and medical planner and administrator.
While serving as deputy Surgeon General of the U.S, Army, he founded the National Library of Medicine.
His last major undertaking was the merger of the Astor, Lenox and Tilden libraries to form the New York City Public Library.
He also designed the building and developed its classification and cataloging systems.
francis amasa walker Francis Amasa Walker (1840 - 1897): One of the most prominent figures in the history of American economics, General Francis A. Walker was a Union general during the U.S. Civil War and superintendent of the 1870 and 1880 census.
A prolific author of texts on economics, he also was president of the American Statistical Association and the first president of the American Economics Associations.
Henry Gannett (1846 - 1914): As geographer of the U.S. censuses of 1880 and 1890 and 1900,as well as the Philippine, Cuban, and Puerto Rican censuses, he became interested in place names.
His efforts to resolve difficulties caused by proliferation, duplication, and confusion of place names led to the establishment of the U.S. Board of Geographic Names in 1890.
He served as the board's chairmen until 1910.
Gannett was one of the founders of the Association of American Geographers and the National Geographic Society, serving as its president from 1910 - 1914.
herman hollerith Herman Hollerith (1860 - 1929): Inventor of the first electrical census tabulating system in the 1880's.
His company, Tabulating Machine Company (founded 1896), merged with three other companies in 1911 and became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924.
w. edwards deming W. Edwards Deming (1900 - 1993): Subsequent to his work at the Census Bureau, Deming developed the theory of quality control.
His theories were implemented by postwar Japan and led to the overhaul of Japanese industry.
Ultimately, the Census took advantage of his quality management legacy and implemented quality controls in it's statistical methodology, customer service, and product development and performance.
The American Statistical Association sponsors the annual Deming lecturer Award to recognize the accomplishments of the recipient and enhance the awareness among the statistical community of Deming's philosophy and methods.
a. ross eckler Ross Eckler (1901 - 1991): Eckler served as deputy director of the Census Bureau from 1949 to 1965, and it's director from 1965 until 1969 - the first career employee ever to become director of the agency.
He authored The Bureau of the Census, a history, and is a former president of the American Statistical Association.
conrad taeuber Conrad Taeuber (1906-1999): As chief of the Population Division, Taeuber led the expansion of the Census Bureau's demographic Program to respond to emerging public policy issues.
He edited the 1950 and 1960 census monograph series and was the author of many articles, two well-known monographs, and book chapters on demographic topics.
His greatest legacy, however, may be his mentoring of colleagues who were inspired by his leadership, kindness, and thoughtfulness. morris h. hansen Morris H. Hansen (1910-1990): Morris Hansen was perhaps the most influential statistician in the evolution of survey methodology in the 20th century.
Early in his Census Bureau career he assembled and directed a staff of mathematical statisticians and other survey methodologists.
They defined and researched the principal problems in the taking of surveys and developed the statistical methods needed for large-scale national surveys, such as formal quality control methods and the derivation of theory and models for analyses of non-sampling errors.
He co-authored (William N. Hurwitz and William C. Madow, also Census Bureau employees) a two-volume statistical text, Revolution in United States Government Statistics.
Volume 2, Sample Survey Methods and Theory, is considered by some in the field to be "the most important book produced by federal employees on sampling and one of the most important books on methods produced as an offshoot from the federal statistical system."
Julius Shishkin (1913-1978): Before joining the Census Bureau in 1945, Shishkin was an instructor in economics and statistics at Rutgers University and served as head economist of the War Production Board from 1942-1945.
At the Census Bureau he was chief of the Economic Research and Analysis Division and assistant director for program planning and evaluation.
During his tenure, he was instrumental in the development of an electronic computer method for seasonally adjusting economic time series and was a major force in the development of the business-cycle statistics program.
In 1969, Shishkin joined the Office of Management and Budget and went on to become commissioner of Labor Statistics in 1973.
The Washington Statistical Society, American Statistical Association, and the National Association of Business Economists sponsor the annual Julius Shishkin award for outstanding achievement in economic statistics.
j. presper eckert john w. mauchly J. Presper Eckert (1919-1995) and John W. Mauchly (1907-1980): Designed and built the first practical electronic digital computer called ENIAC.
In 1946, they contracted with the Department of Commerce to design and constrict an electronic computer specifically for statistical purposes-the UNIVAC I.
This computer revolutionized data processing at the Census Bureau and around the world.
shirley kallek Shirley Kallek (1928-1983): As associate director for Economic Programs, Kallek made extraordinary contributions to the development of economic statistics at the Census Bureau, specifically, the 1972 and 1982 Economic and Agricultural Censuses.
She pioneered the use of administrative records in census programs and special surveys and initiated work on the Industrial Directory (now known as the Standard Statistical Establishment List).
Kallek received international recognition for her skill in developing timely and cost-effective statistical programs for key economic information.
Vincent Barabba Vincent P. Barabba (1934- ): The first and only individual to be appointed director of the Census Bureau on two separate occasions, by a Republican and a Democratic administration.
Barabba served as Director from 1973-1976, and from 1979-1981 (including the 1980 census).
He was later elected president of the American Statistical Association.
roger herriot Roger Herriot (1941-1994): Served as chief of the Population Division (1980-1985) and later associate commissioner for statistical standards and methodology at the National Center for Education Statistics.
At both agencies he was an advocate for the importance and potential value of providing annual data, including poverty measurements, below the national level.
After his sudden death in May 1994, the Washington Statistical Association and the Social Statistics and Government Statistics Sections of the American Statistical Association established the Roger Herriot Award for Innovation in Federal Statistics.
The award recognizes individuals who develop unique approaches to the solution of statistical problems in federal data collection programs.
