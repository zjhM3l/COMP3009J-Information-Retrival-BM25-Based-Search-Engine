12/24/1999 Happy Holidays from all of us down here!!! I'm sure you'd love to be with your families right now, but your work is important.
To make it so we glance deeper into the cosmos and to be able to look into the beginning of time itself is perhaps the greatest gift of all this season.
Repairing the Hubble telescope may answer the question of the ages... who we are and from where do we come.
I can't help but notice how easy you make it look on tele- vision.
Your years of training have paid off and you should be very proud.
Have a safe journey! Ralph A. Lee ...a somewhat envious Earthbound soul 12/24/1999 I'm a Hungaryan boy and I wish the year 2000 will be very beautiful for you! 12/24/1999 To the crew of Discovery, Wishing you all the best and a very happy Christmas.

Johnny Cierpial 12/24/1999 From your perspective in space, I wonder if you can consider the impact that same perspective might have if every person on earth could be sharing it with you now.
The idea of "Peace on Earth" or even "Peace in the Cosmos" might actually make some kind of sense, wouldn't it? So, my Christmas wish to you is simply to carry that sense of vastness and peacefulness with you at all times and be a beacon to all you meet, that they too may experience the loveliness of the creation we inhabit, and keep it that way, whatever course cosmic evolution may have.
Thank you and happy hearts.

Having a good time getting gifts? I sure am! I have a question for you.
What percentage of radiation do astronauts get while in space? Does that make them more prone to Cancer? Or does it make them Gemini? ( Ha, ha.)
I hope you're having a successful time figuring out scientific questions.

Hubble, the shuttle program and (even) the space station are all steps we need to take to explore deeper, farther, and faster.
God Speed 12/24/1999 Thank you! 12/24/1999 Great job! Your efforts were a wonderful holiday gift for humankind - especialy those of us who realize the intrinsic value of scientific discovery.
12/24/1999 I'm an American living in New Zealand, and we're all very proud and thankful for what you're doing up there.
Have a very MERRY CHRISTMAS! 12/24/1999 Merry Christmas to all of you.
Thanks for a job well done.
Prayers to you on a safe mission and a speedy return.
12/24/1999 I vividly rememeber Shepherd's flight into space decades ago, and remained amazed at the skill and courage of our astronauts.
May your mission be successful and may you return to your homes and loved ones safely.
All Peace and Joy to you and yours! 12/24/1999 Merry Christmas, Space shuttle guys! Have a safe trip and a safe return.
Happy Holidays! 12/24/1999 May your presence in space be a message to all that there can be peace on earth and good will can be shared by men of good faith.
Our prayers are with you as you go about your work.
A Very Merry Christmas.
12/24/1999 You, the crew of the Space Shuttle must be the bravest people on the planet!! What you experience is beyond what most people can imagine.
Being British, we are both proud that Michael Fould is there to represent us and we wish him well.
Have a fab Xmas and come safely for the New Year.
PS.
Hope you manage to fix that monster telescope!! Ian and Lorraine, Blackpool, England.
12/24/1999 Merry Chrismas! to All: I can not believe that you have been working and repairing the telescope in th space.
You are GREAT! Best Wishes!!! Wishing all of you come back to the U.S safely on th 27th.
Have a safe trip!!! Takako 12/24/1999 My father, Bill, helped to design the shuttle, while working for Rockwell, in Downey.
He now has Alzeimers but vividly remem- bers designing the shuttle and always speaks of his joy in working with the space program.
A message from space would make him very happy, if the time can be found.
Good luck on your mission and may God deliver you safely back to earth and your families.
Thank you 12/24/1999 You, are doing great work up there.I will be so grateful to have the Hubble up and running.
The pics are fantastic.
Best of Luck and May God bless all of you.Merry Christmas 12/24/1999 Seasons Greetings to the shuttle crew.
Thank you for all your work in repairing the Hubble.
It has been a wonderful addition to the exploration of space and its importance hasn't been fully appreciated.
I appreciate your sacrifices in being away from your families at this time of the year and wish you peace and happiness in the coming year.
Thanks again guys, Mark Stratton 12/24/1999 wishing you the best on your Christmas spent in the stars and praying that you have a safe return to your families and loved ones.
we appreciate the hard work and time spent away that you all endure.
Happy Holidays - The Owens Family Blue Springs, MO 12/24/1999 Hello, Gentlemen -- Very proud of you all, and thinking warm thoughts of you this Christmas.
It will be sooooo nice to have the Hubble back in operation -- I look for its photos every day at Astronomy Picture of the Day, and have missed them.
Best wishes and prayers for a successful trip and safe return.
God bless, Keara O'Dempsey odempsey@bestweb.net 12/24/1999 merry christmas from the Cossu family .
We are in the Sardinian island.
Good luck!!!! 12/24/1999 Wishing the crew all the best as they spend the holiday on orbit.
I know they'd like to be home, but...
There are advantages of being in orbit over the holidays: -You don't have to worry about the scale showing you've gained weight from the cookies.
-You travel faster than Santa.
It takes him all day to make it around the world.
-You can have Christmas morning on every continent as the sun comes up ever 90 minutes.
-Fruitcakes are too heavy to send into space.
-Nobody expects you to reply to their Christmas cards.
-It's somebody else's problem to figure out why the lights stopped blinking.
Best Wishes from The Green Mountain State.

It absolutely astonishes us to know you're in orbit let alone doing the repair work on the Hubble.
May God bless you all as we seek to understand the mysteries of our world through the Hubble.
Thank you so much for your bravery.
Happy Holidays in space! 12/24/1999 Dear Shuttle crew, At this very special time, it must be extremely hard to be so very far from home and family.
But remember, we celebrate the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ, the son of God, The Creator of this vast universe.
What a thrill it must be to see the wonders from that vantage point.
As you go to sleep on this night of wonders, know there are many who appreciate the work you are doing.
We wish you all love, peace, and joy in this coming year.

I am also an aspiring Astronomer, so your efforts for Hubble are even more important to me! I'm a junior in high school and am taking my first Physics class this year and over the summer I took an Astronomy class and it just makes me want to be involved in the space program even more.
Merry Christmas and a safe landing.
Happy New Year when it comes around.

Breanne Davies 12/24/1999 Hi my name is Valerie from Quebec city.
I learn a lot about your mission on the web site of nasa.
I would like to know: Can I have access to some pictures of the earth and space from hubble on the internet? If yes, where can I find it? Space is so beautiful and facinating.
So I wish to you a Merry Christmas and I believe that will be to most special Christmas of your life (I hope) Good Luck for the end of your mission.
Take care!!! Valerie.
12/24/1999 Hi shuttle crew! I just wanted to tell you how lucky I think you are to go up in space, and especially so since you have all been up there multiple times.
I've been following your mission from NASA's website, and I'm glad it's gone pretty well so far.
Good luck, and have a happy holiday and a safe trip back to earth! 12/24/1999 Barcelona para la tripulaciÂ¢n del Discovery.
Desde esta ciudad mediterr nea os deseo junto con mi familia una feliz Navidad y un buen viaje de retorno a nuestro pequeÂ¤o planeta azul.
Mi nombre es MÂ¦ Dolors y aunque a diario me desenvuelvo en el medio acu tico (enseÂ¤o a nadar) ,gracias a vosotros y a vuestro estupendo trabajo puedo volar hacia las estrellas con las maravillosas vistas del hubble para una iniciada a la astronomia como yo. Vuestro trabajo es para mi un gran regalo de Navidad.Gracias.
12/24/1999 Dear astronaut, Merry Christmas to you and your family.
I hope you had a wonderful Christmas in space aboard Discovery on the mission to repare the Hubble telescope.
Although I have something to talk about other than the Christmas season.
I am 14 years of age and a scholastic achiever within my high school.
I have a 3.8 grade point average, and every honors class offered to a student of the freshman class.
For my high achievements, I have always set high goals for myself.
Just a couple years ago, I had set a goal which will change my educational pattern throughout my entire life.
This goal is to become an astronaut for NASA.
I have only some information which will allow me to achieve this highly alliet goal.
What I am asking of you, is to give me information from your own experience, on how astronauts are choosen, and what I must do between now, and the next 20+ years to achieve this goal.
If necessary you may be brief in your write back of information, although please give as much details as possible.
Your information will hopefully link me to better resources to receive the education and training to become an astronaut in the future.
Thank you so very much for your time and consideration towards making my future goal, become reality through your information given from your own knowledge.
Concerned, Tracy Moore 12/24/1999 Hey guys Good luck on your mission during the holidays.
You are fixing the coolest machine that we can have out there.
The hubble always gives us new knowledge on the start of everything.Whats cooler than that.
12/24/1999 Shuttle Crew Members, Looks like St. Nick won't be the only one flying around the world tonight! MERRY CHRISTMAS! to You all.
Thanks for your hard work on the HST, it is truly a Science marvel.

I envy you.
Keep Flying, have a safe return.

I'm only 14, but I can't wait to get up there doing what you all are right now (hopefully not another Hubble mission though :)! I hope you realize how lucky you are, and I know for a fact that your families understand how important this mission is.
I just wanted to wish you all a very merry Christmas(Hanahka, Kwanza, whatever) and tell you that everyone down here really appreciates what you are doing for the space industry.
And some day when I become an astronaut, I'll remember that no matter where you need to go, when you are going, or what the mission requires you to do, it's worth it.
Thanks alot up there! Godspeed! Carisa, WI 12/24/1999 HI! How's the air up there? Just thought I'd write and tell you to have a Merry Christmas! Keep safe and good luck!

WE ARE PROUD OF ALL OF YOU. 12/24/1999 To the Discovery crew and their families, Merry Christmas! Thank you for giving up your holiday together to accomplish this important work.
In the past, I too have missed being home for the holidays because of business or travel.
One of the times I was in Germany over Christmas and New Years.
I wanted to be home but knew that would be impossible.
Even though it wasn't like being with my family, I did enjoy seeing Christmas from a different perspective.
I'd love to see the perspective from space even if just once and even if that was a Christmas time.
Your crew and mission will always be remembered as the only shuttle to be up at Christmas.
You're kind of unique.
May your mission be a successful one.
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! David Bolton compnerd62@usa.net compnerd62@usa.com 12/24/1999 Dear Discovery Astronauts, Congratulations for repairing the Hubble Space Telescope.

12/24/1999 Hi.
My name is Josh Jones and I live in Brunswick, Georgia.
I just completed Space Camp and Cape Canaveral on December 10, 1999.
I really enjoyed it.
I got to be the pilot on the mission for Discovery and the Mission scientist for the Endeavor mission.
I had a great time.
One day I will be where you are now.
My goal in life is to be an astronaut...
I hope you have a wonderful Christmas.
I will be keeping up with your mission.
12/24/1999 Weather is here,hope you are fine.Many happy returns! 12/24/1999 12-24-99 Having a great time, NO DOUGHT.
This is something none of you will ever forget.
What an oportunity.
It must be beautiful, where you are.
Thanks for your courage and service.
The knowledge is all out there.
All we must do is FIND IT! Frank J Valles.
12/24/1999 Merry Christmas and Godspeed.
I tried to come see you guys launch, but was unable to do so after all the delays.
I am just glad you got up there and are doing such a fine job.
Keep up the good work.
Suzanne Campbell Columbia, MD 12/24/1999 To the members of Shuttle Discovery: Good luck with your mission.
It's an extreme pleasure to be able to look to the heavens and know that heros still exist! May you all have a very Merry Christmas and a safe journey home.
12/24/1999 Dear Curt, Jean-Francois, C. Michael, John, Scott, Claude and Steven, How are you doing up there? My name is Meritxell.
I am 20 years old and I am from Spain, a town placed very close to Barcelona (Olympics '92).
This morning I was reading the newspaper and there was an article about your incredible trip.
Then I saw an address to which I could write and send you a Christmas message.
I think you deserve a message and a lot more than that.
Guys I have to tell that I am really amazed.
I know that before being able to go to the space you have had to work very hard, but you are there now.
I think it has to be an amazing experience.
Tomorrow is Christmas, and maybe you are thinking of what you would be doing if you were with your family, but down here everything continues being as always, you know people singing by the Christmas tree, others dying of hunger, others in Txetxenia trying to avoid being killed, and so on.
I have often thought that to see the Earth from the space, has to be like looking at a book, in which you can see the scenes and the characters, but they cannot see you.
Is this the impression that you have when looking at it? Well, I know that eventhough you are far away from home you will still sing some caroles, won't you? Well done, I think that no matter the place one is at Christmas, he should enjoy it.
I wish you have a safe trip back home and thank you for the great job you are doing.
Merry Christmas !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love, Meritxell 12/24/1999 Hello everybody!!! Over here in wet old England we'll be starting Christmas a little sooner the you will be, but have a great christmas up there! One day I aim to be up there celebrating, but you never know, anyway I have no use for odds so I WILL be up there.
Congrats on the mission and I hope everything else goes to plan, MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!! from Jamie Addis P.S. to Mike Foale Do you know Gary Dalrymple? He is slated to fly next year sometime I think, met him through his mother.
Bye!!!!!!! 12/24/1999 Hello Happy Christmas From Alistair in England 12/24/1999 To Mike and the rest of the shuttle crew from the Pawson family in Yorkshire, England.
Our thoughts are with you at this special time, have the christmas of a lifetime and a safe return.

Bruce, Gillian, and Vicky.

Merry Christmas !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love, Meritxell 12/24/1999 Just want you to know that many of us still view NASA as the pinacle of human achievement.
From moon walks to space walks, our space program shows us what we can do and gives us a perspective on ourselves that we can not see from Earth.
Thank you for all your hard work and have a happy holiday season.

12/24/1999 Hello from Roanoke, Va.
I was surfing the web and stumbled onto this site and wanted to wish you guys Happy Holidays and a Happy New Millenium.
I was actually very happy to find this site because I have always been amazed at the feat of space travel even though a lot of people seem to think of it as routine, but it still amazes me.
It's also good to know about the NASA web sit so I will have a place to follow some of the missions.
It seems like they don't get very much publicity anymore.
Good luck with the rest of your mission and have a safe trip home.
I'll be sure to wave to you tonight when I look up at the stars.
Many thanks for a good repair job! Ben James, Roanoke Virginia 12/24/1999 Hello! My Dad and I want to wish you a very Merry Y2K Christmas! And a happy and peaceful New Millennium! My Dad, Jerry Hern II, is the CEO of the TRIAD POWER GROUP.

Call me nieve, but I have other things to worry about that WON'T take care of themselves.
I hope you will receive lots of warm wishes from us folks down here on Earth.
God Bless you and have Safe (travels).

12/24/1999 Hello, I just wanted to commend all of you on your excellent work.
While these types of missions might seem like "old hat" to most members of the public and media, there are still those of us who realize that the science involved with the Hubble and experience gained by EVA's will benefit mankind in the long run.
Take care, have a Merry Christmas and a safe return, Larry 12/24/1999 Dear Curt, Jean-Francois, Mr. C. Foale, John, Scott, Claude and Steven; What a way to spend the holiday! Did any of you ever think when you were growing up that one day you would be making a long distance delivery to the Hubble in space? Anyhow, I wish you luck and happiness as you live a dream that very few people get to.
Merry Christmas boys! Catherine Hadi http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/8624/notepage.html 12/24/1999 Merry Christmas.

Dear STS 103 crew, You are spending this Christmas, the last of this millennium, in Space.
I believe everybody wants to spend Christmas at home, with family and friends, and I'm sure that in spite of the beauty of space and of the hard work you have to perform in orbit, you're all missing the Earth and the people you love down here.
However, I know your work is fundamental for all of us, and I will think about you guys tonight, during the Holy mass, and tomorrow, during Christmas.
You're working for all mankind, and therefore, all mankind is your family.
The world is missing you, and wishes you a Merry Christmas.

It is most humbling to me that you would give up this time to serve your country in a way that allows us to continue with the most important work of observing the universe in a way that allows so much important "discovery" work to be completed that benefits all of mankind.
The shuttle Discovery and her fine crew is aptly named and appropriately associated with the task of maintaining the "discovery" missions of the Hubble Space Telescope.
12/24/1999 Happy holydays to the guys that make our future by letting us see the past(billions of years ago) Feliz Navidad !! 12/24/1999 Wishing you could be with your families.

12/24/1999 Dear Shuttle Crew, Having recently visited the Huntsville, AL, training center, I was "in awe" of the progress NASA has made in space exploration during my lifetime (I'm 38).
I was grateful to be able to share this time in Huntsville with my 12 year old son.
He was quite amazed at the history of the program and is excited to see what new discoveries will be made during his lifetime.
I just wanted to say "Thank You" for your desire for knowledge, and discovery that lead you to committe your life to the space program.
I know it is difficult to be away from your family during the holiday season, but please know that some of us here on Earth, are looking up tonight and saying a special prayer for your safe return and your dedication.

I still remember seeing the very first shuttle launch in grade school, and I've never lost my fascination with the space program - I was born the day Apollo 11 launched, so I think that has something to do with it :) Best wishes to you all, have a safe and successful mission, and we'll see you back home on the ground soon so you can celebrate a proper holiday with your families! -- Jim Schmidt Zaren Ankleweed - Bitdancer, Freelance | "It's the information age -- Acquisitions Agent, Minister for "Bob" | everything gets saved a.k.a.
