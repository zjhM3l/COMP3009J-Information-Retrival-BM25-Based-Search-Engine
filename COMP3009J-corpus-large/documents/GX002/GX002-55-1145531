Thanks for all the hard work guys, we appreciate it! Rick Freas Phoenix, AZ 12/22/1999 I'm glad y'all were able to get the mission off before Y2K! I watched all afternoon with admiration as the team repaired the Hubble Telescope.
You made it seem so easy even though I know it was extremely hard work.
It's good practice for the International Space Station!! I just wish everyone knew how important learning to work in space is and will be, but having the space walks broadcast on the internet is getting the word out.
God bless and have a safe return.
With love from Bill, Mary, Christine, Kyle, and Rachel in McKinney Texas! 12/22/1999 Love your show! Merry Christmas and hurry back safe.
Love Rob and Joan P.S.

What you do is very important and it is sad that the media does not promote the Shuttle Missions more than they do.
I have C-band, so I get the NASA channel and get to watch the missions.
I think it is very important for the youth of today to be aware of what the Shuttle and exploration of space does for this world.
You all should be commended for a job well done and the sacrifices you all make.
Thank you for all your hard work! Many blessings to you all and safe 2000.

12/22/1999 Good Job: Happy Holiday to All.
Have a safe trip home Rick Kellogg 12/22/1999 I watched your launch from Homestead, Florida with my wife and 22 month old daughter.
It was an amazing display, even though we were 250 miles away.
As my daughter saw you lift into space I wondered if what you are doing today will make space, and our understanding of our role' in nature more accesible to her in her adulthood.
I think so.
What you are doing is of vital importance to the destiny of humankind.
As a species we must continue to explore and I feel you are on the cutting edge of that exploration.
I admire you ALL very much and hope that your tenure in space is in some small way compensation for the seperation you are experiencing from your families and loved ones.
Be safe, and be aware that in some small way you are helping advance our species.
Vija con Dios! Michael Jon Littman Homestead, Florida USA 12/22/1999 Keep up the good work! My grandson Tom wants to be the first person to land on Mars, but after watching you with the Hubble, he may change his mind and want to be an astronaut.

Merry Christmas.
Ben (Age 4 Somerville, NJ, USA) 12/22/1999 Merry Christmas.
Although it is difficulty to be away from home at this time of year, remember that there are many people down here on Earth that appreciate the work that you are doing.
I have (as a nurse) spent many holidays at work instead of at home, and although difficult, I knew that the reason for the celebration would wait.
Besides, remember, Orthodox Christian Christmas is on epiphany! It was our saving grace many years, and a hidden blessing.
Happy Christmas for both calendars (as the Orthodox and Christian calendars differ).
Best wishes from the Tarasoff family in Boerne, Texas 12/22/1999 Season's greetings! We really appreciate your sacrifices in undertaking the mission to repair the Hubble telescope.

Also, we are very sorry that you can not spend Christmas eve and day with your families and friends.
Merry Christmas, God bless, and we wish you a safe and speedy trip home to our Big Blue Marble.

Good luck on your mission - I have worked in a high bay on the ground and I can only imagine how tough it is in space.
God speed to all of you and a safe trip home.
Best Wishes.
John (Lockheed Martin, Sunnyvale, CA) 12/22/1999 To the Shuttle Crew, Have a safe and Merry Christmas and Holiday season.
May your journey be a successful one.
12/22/1999 John Grunsfeld- Greetings from the Huff's and Tramels.
We just saw your walk and we had to drop you a line...
What does it feel like to be in space? I hope you feel good in space.
Uncle Tony gave us your mission patch for our shoulder.
Caroline (age 4) At Uncle Tony's I had fun making boats out of driftwood and feathers and then sinking them.
I also found a lot of graphite chunks on the beach.
I bet it took a lot of work to become an astronaut.
Someday, I would like to go up in space also.
Christopher (age 13) John- It's fun to hear all about your space walk on the news.
It sure makes us proud to be related.
Best of luck with the rest of the mission.
Enjoy your Christmas in space and then again when you get home.
Susan "Mace" John- Best of luck in this fantastic endeavor! Uncle Jim We really are enjoying your John Grunsfeld Daily Reports.
We've made a notebook with each day and are tracking your progress.
All the best!!! Kelsey (11), Lloyd, 
May each of you receive a blessing while circling our home.
12/22/1999 to the crew of discovery, we hope you guys have a safe mission and return to mother earth.
have a galactic merry christmas, and a blastoff of a new millennium of wonderful discoverys from the hubble telescope.

DOWN HERE WE'RE EXPERIENCING A NO SNOW 2 DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN NORTH AMERICA, NEW YORK,EAST NORTHPORT,5 TAMARACK ST.
WE'LL BE WATCHING FOR YOUR SHUTTLE IN THE SKY AND THE BRIGHTEST MOON EVER.
GOOD LUCK FROM DAVID SWANSON AGE-9 ZIP-11731 12/22/1999 we hope you have a very merry christmas and a happy new year in your shuttle.how is santa going to find you in the shuttle and how is he going to get in because you have no chimney?can you please write back when you have a chance? sincerely Tyler and Kendall Senesac 12/22/1999 Dear Crew; CHRISTMAS ABOVE EARTH MIGHT NOT BE EVERYONE'S FAVORITE IDEA OF CELEBRATING THE HOLIDAY, BUT I THINK THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE IS SO IMPORTANT TO GET REPAIRED THAT THE SACRIFICE YOU ALL ARE MAKING IS WONDERFUL.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'LL BE THE FIRST SHUTTLE CREW TO BE ALOFT FOR CHRISTMAS: I HOPE NASA INCLUDED A SPECIAL DINNER FOR ALL OF YOU TO ENJOY! ALL THE BEST OF LUCK.
WARMEST REGARDS DAVID ADAMS SAN FRANCISCO 12/22/1999 I hope you will have a wonderful holiday out there exploring and admiring God's beautiful creations from a new angle most of us will never experience! Thank you for giving up your holiday so that the rest of the world can enjoy the amazing things that are out there, by repairing the telescope! Love and peace always from Jennifer Savage, Warsaw, Indiana 12/22/1999 Does Santa really Deliver the goods? Thanks to comedy bytes! I found this on the internet.
I hope you enjoy it! 1.No known species of reindeer can fly.
BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.
2.There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world.
BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau.
At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes.
One presumes there's at least one good child in each.
3.Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical).
This works out to 822.6 visits per second.
This is to say that for each household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house.
Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.
This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times the speed of sound.
For purposes of comparison, the fastest man- made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 35 miles per hour.
4.The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.
Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight.
On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 1000 pounds.
Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine.
We need 71,4200 reindeer.
This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons.
Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.
5.353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as a spacecraft reentering the earth's atmosphere.
The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy.
Per second.
Each.
In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake.
The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second.
Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity.
A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.
In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now.

I'm writing from Milan (Italy) and I would like to be with you for seeing our wonderful planet and tell to all over the world that the Earth is our mother, our life and we depends totally for her.
Destroing the Earth is as foolish as committing a suicide, with the difference that all the world will die.

Again merry Xmas and a happy new year.

I tried to keep up with the news, but you know how this time of year is, that's what makes these missions even more challenging for you all.
It's the very reason we as Americans respect our NASA programs and all they stand for.
We have visited the Johnson Space Center in Houston,TX.
many times and every visit has always been breathtaking!! Once again may God be with you all, wish you a safe return back home, and a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Merry Christmas and a happy New Millenium! James Lyons jpclyons@hotmail.com 12/22/1999 STS-103 Hubble Space Telescope Crew, I want to personally wish each of you a very special Merry Christmas.
I understand the difficulty in working out in Space and away from home on this holiday.
I want to personally thank you for your dedication and personal sacrifice to make this mission a success.
To be able to celebrate Christmas in Space must be a special time for each of you.
I know that it is vastly different.
One of the gifts that I will treasure will be the rememberance of seeing each of you on Christmas day along with millions of others as we reflect on how fortunate we are to have such a valuable program for our country.
I will be praying for you and your families on December 25th and look forward to your return as we all celebrate the new Millennium and close out the current one with STS-103.
12/22/1999 I wish all of you happy holidays and a great new year and hope all is well with Hubble and that she is working beter than ever.

The farthest reach of my imagination cannot grasp how the experience of space travel must affect your outlook on life.
It seems we take things too seriously on Earth and forget where we fit in to the grand scheme of a Solar System and beyond.
I hope you have a terrific journey in orbit, and a sweet landing back on Earth.
Carry on bravely, Chris Downing Vancouver, British Columbia Canada 12/22/1999 Hello people in the shuttle.

Im sure such a well seasoned crew will make the most of this opportunity; notwithstanding, of course, the rookie.
Im not sure what altitude Santa flies at Scott, but seeing as this is your first time in space maybe you should keep an eye out just in case.

12/22/1999 DEAR CREW From our little country - The Netherlands - I wish all of you a very special Christmas.
Only a very few people on our blue planet had the opportunity to see the world as is in the greater context of the universe.Alhough we made a "great leap...." we still have an enormous distance to travel to world peace.
Hopefully you will find a little moment for contemplation up there God bless you.

The future of the world lies in space.
It's exciting to have you and all the shuttle crews taking us to that future.
Merry Christmas.
(Hey, Curt and Scott, watch out for flying reindeer and a guy in a bright red suit!!) Marshall Ginn Arlington, VA 12/22/1999 Dear Curt, Jean-Francois, Michael, John, Scott, Claude and Steven, The sacrifice you make, being away from home and family on Christmas, does not go unnoticed or unappreciated.
Thank you for the precious gift you are giving to all of humanity - the gift of restoring our child-like wonder at the awesome beauty and immensity of God's creation.
Our thoughts and prayers are with you.
Good luck and God-speed your successful and safe return to Earth, home, and family.
Merry Christmas! Richard, Kami 
My father always tell me that he watched the landing on TV (here in Brazil!) and that was amazing ! Today I work with very hi-tech stuff, but I know that it is nothing if compared with the "real size" of your work.
I wish you the best, and I hope that spending Christmas time "a little bit far from here" is not so bad, since you will really be the only guys that can really look for all of us, here on Earth, at the same time !! Regards, Claudio Mazzali 12/22/1999 Merry christmas from Mr. Murray's physics class.
Have fun and good luck, dont eat too many liquefied candy canes, do you have those? 12/22/1999 Consider yourselves the luckiest people off the face of the Earth! I would change places with you in less than a heartbeat - but then I'd probably have to fight you for the opportunity.
To be able to look down on the Earth, to feel the serenity of spaceflight, to see all God's creation above and below - I know the pictures can't do justice.
You have to be there to experience it.
For me, that would be grandest Christmas present EVER - and you get to do it for a job! It may be hard to be seperated from your loved ones at this special time of the year.
Just know that someone, besides them, wishes he could be with you - out there.
Maybe one day...
So, from one home on Earth to your temporary home in space, I wish all of you the Merriest Christmas and hope to see you safely return to Earth after your succesful HST Mission.
MERRY CHRISTMAS! PS - Keep a watchful eye out for a guy in a red suit, riding in a sleigh pulled by 8 reindeer.
Rumor has it he may be passing quite close to your vacinity.
You may want to report on any strange sighting of such a vehicle.
This is an authorized flight, I understand.
12/22/1999 Gentlemen, I appreciate your efforts concerning the reparation of the HST.
I'm a true fan of those few hundred thousand pictures taken so far.
I usually spend two or three hours a day searching the web for newer ones.
Of course I didn't see all the images, but I have a collection of 5 CDs already.
So, please hurry up and of course take care.
I wish you a Merry Christmas and a safe jurney home.

That was the mission of Apollo 8, and I was with my family visiting relatives that Chrismas evening...kids were playing around, grownups were socializing,all was fun and exitement.
But my parents were alerted by me that a live broadcast was soon coming from the moon and Apollo 8.
The relatives agreed to let me watch the broadcast, and when it started, the whole room fell silent as the crew read a Christmas message from the moon...I shall never forget that night..nor do I think anybody will , the whole world was captured by the word of Eugene Cernan, and the goodwill message from the moon...my question is, will the crew of the Discovery send a Christmas message to earth? I hope you all have a Merry Christmas, and Godspeed to you all..

I am a 9 year old Weeblo Scount from Lancaster, Pa.
Were any of you Scouts when you were younger? I think that space exploration is really cool and I hope that I can go into space some day.
My parents tell me that it is because of the hard work of people like you that I might be able to do it someday! It must be hard being away from your friends and family during the holidays, but on the other hand, it must be really exciting to be up there.
Will you be able to see Santa and his sleigh from space? I hope you can answer me so I can share this with the other scouts in my den.
Good luck and Godspeed and Happy Holidays to everyone on board.

For millions of years it has always been the same in the universe.
Only, WE came and now it's all new for us.
The feeling that you have (separated from us) is very important.
I think that it gives you back a healthy an greatfull feeling and a complete different look at our world.
I hope that one day everybody on this planet will understand this feeling you have out there!! Good luck!!! 12/22/1999 Merry Christmas and Happy New Year Y2K!!!!!!!! 12/22/1999 you all are doing a wonderful job up there.
