Islam is one of the fastest-growing religions in the United States today.
According to one recent survey, there are 1,209 mosques in America, well over half founded in the last 20 years.
Between 17 and 30 percent of American Muslims are converts to the faith.
At the center of both traditional American life and the lives of the generally more recent Muslim immigrants is the family.
As Shahed Amanullah, an engineer who lives in San Franciso, California, puts it, " American values are, by and large, very consistent with Islamic values, with a focus on family, faith, hard work, and an obligation to better self and society."
This booklet is a brief introduction to a complex subject, an attempt to explore in words and images the extraordinary range and richness of the way American Muslims live.
That point of cross-cultural commonality -- the family -- is where we begin.
