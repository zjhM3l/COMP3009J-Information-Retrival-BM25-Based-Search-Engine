There are a number of things that you can do to optimize the look of nces.ed.gov on your computer.
We recommend browsing with either:
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or 6.0 * Netscape 4.0 or 7.0
Of course, using versions of either of these browsers such as Netscape Communicator 4.79 and Internet Explorer 4.0 will also work.
These browsers are all free downloads.
We've designed our pages to take advantage of browser features such as Javascript.
Both Microsoft and Netscape browsers support Javascript, but sometimes in slightly different ways.
We also make sure that our pages can be viewed by older browsers.
If you're not using Netscape or Internet Explorer, you will also get a good view of nces.ed.gov by using a browser that supports tables, forms, and images.
Top of Page Red Bullet Appearance - Resolution NCES makes every effort possible to develop for our audience's varying graphics resolutions.
While we currently develop most of our pages for 800 x 600 resolution, we try to develop for both 640 x 480 and up to 1280 x 1024 resolution.
By using this as our guideline, we can be sure that everyone can enjoy horizontal-free scrolling when viewing our pages.
Of course our pages can be best viewed in 1280 x 1024 resolution.
As mentioned, although we try to accommodate all screen resolutions some of our data tables are just too large to fit on one screen in a 640 x 480 screen resolution.
When this occurs we recommend changing your screen resolution to 800 x 600 or higher.
This is easily done on your computer (PC's) by going to your "control panel" and selecting "display".
Within display select "settings" and choose the screen resolution you would like.

Top of Page Red Bullet Portable Document Format (PDF) PDF File Why we use PDF
Many NCES reports and graphics placed on our website are created in Portable Document Format (PDF).
They are most commonly denoted by the above icon.
PDF is used because it maintains the original look and feel of large documents, and allows us to place more publications on the web in a quick and efficient manner.
Further, PDF products are independent of platforms, applications, and distribution media.

Having problems with PDF Files? Should you experience PDF files appearing as a blank window within Internet Explorer after downloading and are using Adobe Acrobat Reader version 3.0 or earlier, please upgrade to a later version.
If this does not resolve the issue please follow the following steps: Use the "Save Target As" or "Save Link As" option to download the PDF file directly to your hard drive and bypass the Acrobat Reader plug-in.
1.
Using the right-side mouse button click on the file (click on the title link) you are interested in.
2.
Select the "save target as" option in Internet Explorer, or "save link as" in Netscape.
3.
Save as type should be "Adobe Acrobat Document" or "all files."
4. Make sure you name the file (or accept the name supplied).
5.
Know the location of where you are saving it.
6.
Hit save.
7. Use the Adobe Acrobat Reader to open the file after downloading.
Accessibility and PDF's Adobe Systems, Inc. is producing various products designed to make PDF documents accessible to persons using screen reading software.
Their accessibility webpages describe their efforts.
They also have a free downloadable accessibility plug-in called, MakeAccessible.
This plug-in runs under Microsoft Windows 95 OSR 2.0, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT 4.0 with SP 5 or SP 6, or Windows 2000.
Each system should have at least 64 MB (128 MB recommended) of RAM per processor, 200 MB of virtual memory, and 870 K of disk space available.
The MakeAccessible Plug-in creates a tagged Adobe PDF file from an untagged PDF file.
This allows a pdf document to be read by a screen reader for greater accessibility.
Other Acrobat Add-ons Once you've downloaded and installed the Acrobat Reader, you'll be able to view PDF files simply by clicking on the link to the PDF file in your browser.
Either the browser will handle the PDF file, or it will bring up another program for viewing the PDF file.
Either way, a special window will appear that contains buttons that work only for PDF files.
Use these buttons to navigate through the file.
If you want to print the PDF file, you must use the print button located within the Adobe Acrobat viewer (usually this is just above the document on the left side).
Use of the browser print button or the browser's "File, Print" command will not result in a correct printout.
The NCES website supports byteserving.
Byteserving, also known as page-at-a-time or byte-range downloading, enables you to view a PDF file from a Web server before the entire file is downloaded.
Note: Byteserving is not supported by the older versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader, so you may need to install a newer version.
Once you get byteserving working, if you'd like the full document to be downloaded in the background even as you browse through it, select the "Allow Background Download of Entire File" option in the General Preferences of the Acrobat Reader.
Top of Page Red Bullet Video/Audio Playback and Flash About Video and Audio Playback Media Player
NCES has adopted Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) as its standard for video deployment.
Videos will be able to be viewed immediately using Windows Media Player, or can be downloaded for easier viewing.
The downloaded version will always be better quality than the streamed or viewable copy; this is due to performance reasons.
The Windows Media Player should automatically download any needed codecs (these are needed to view certain video formats).
How to obtain Windows Media Player Click here to acquire Windows Media Player.
About Macromedia Flash Flash NCES uses Macromedia Flash in some of our applications, most notably in the NCES Student's Classroom.
Macromedia Flash Player displays web application front-ends, high-impact website user interfaces, interactive online advertising, and short-form to long-form animation.
Designers and developers use Macromedia Flash MX to develop distinctive and compelling content, revolutionary user interfaces, and rich applications for the web.
It is pre-installed in most web browsers and on most computers.
It is included in Windows 98 (including all new Windows 98 and Windows XP computers), Netscape Navigator, Apple Macintosh operating systems, America Online, and WebTV, among others.

Top of Page Red Bullet Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) About Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
NCES has adopted Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) as a graphics file format.
SVG is a web development language based on XML. SVG, a W3C recommendation (web standard), enables web developers and designers to create dynamically generated, high-quality graphics from real-time data with precise structural and visual control.
Through the use of SVG, we are able to offer dynamically generated, high-quality, scalable, interactive graphics from real-time data.
Although many SVG viewers are available, NCES recommends the Adobe SVG Viewer 3.0 (or above) as a stable, well-supported viewer.
How to obtain Adobe's SVG Viewer Visit Adobe SVG Viewer Download Area to download a free viewer.
Top of Page Red Bullet ZIP Format Archive Files Zip File Why we use ZIP
A Zip format allows either extremely large files, or files created in formats no longer widely used, to be combined and compressed and thus downloaded with more speed and ease.
The user requires an "unzip" utility to extract files from an archive (all files for downloading have been compressed using zip archiving and compression).
NCES uses Zip archiving for several of its newer applications, such as video, and for many data sets.
In addition, some older reports are available only in a combination of file formats, such as Lotus .WK1 format for tables and plain ASCII for the text.
The time it takes to download a file depends on two factors: the size of the file and your connection speed.
To estimate the time required to download a file we have provided a link to a "File Download Time Calculator."
