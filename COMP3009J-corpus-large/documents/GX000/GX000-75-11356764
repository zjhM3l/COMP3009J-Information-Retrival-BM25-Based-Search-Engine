Raw cane sugar, refined sugar, sugar syrups, specialty sugars and sugar-containing products enter the United States under a variety of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs).
Low within-quota tariff rates facilitate access to the U.S. market.
The minimum sizes of the TRQs and the corresponding duties reflect obligations made by the United States.
When Congress ratified the NAFTA and WTO (Uruguay Round) treaties, these TRQs became part of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule.
The USDA's Sugar-Containing Products Re-Export Program is designed to put U.S. manufacturers of sugar-containing products on a level playing field in the world market.
U.S. participants in the Sugar-Containing Products Re-Export Program may buy world priced sugar from any of the refiner participants or their agents for use in products that will be exported onto the world market.
The Refined Sugar Re-Export Program is designed to facilitate the use of domestic refining capacity to export refined sugar into the world market.
The program establishes a license against which a refiner can export domestically produced refined sugar and later import world raw sugar, import world raw sugar for refining and distribution into the domestic market and later export refined sugar, or import raw sugar, refine it and export it into the world market.
The program was implemented to mitigate the imposition of restrictive quotas, which reduced the quantity of raw sugar allowed to enter the U.S. domestic market.
The Sugar for the Production of Polyhydric Alcohol Program is established to provide world priced sugar to U.S. manufacturers of polyhydric alcohols.
Participating U.S. manufacturers purchase world priced sugar from licensed refiners or their agents for use in the production of polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols that are used as a substitute for sugar in human food consumption.
