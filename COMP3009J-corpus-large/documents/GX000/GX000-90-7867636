Unconsolidated deposit - Deposit of loosely bound sediment that typically fills topographically low areas.
Underground water - Subsurface water in the unsaturated and saturated zones.

Un-ionized - The neutral form of an ionizable compound (such as an acid or a base).
Un-ionized ammonia - The neutral form of ammonia-nitrogen in water, usually occurring as NH[4]OH. Un-ionized ammonia is the principal form of ammonia that is toxic to aquatic life.
The relative proportion of un-ionized to ionized ammonia (NH^4+) is controlled by water temperature and pH.
At temperatures and pH values typical of most natural waters, the ionized form is dominant.
