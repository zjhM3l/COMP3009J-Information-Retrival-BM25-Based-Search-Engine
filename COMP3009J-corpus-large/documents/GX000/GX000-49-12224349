You are one of a few people who got a chance to go out side our atmosphere.
YOu got a chance to see the outside world.
Above all you will understand how complex and integrated and live in a proper manner.
Some of the stars are very very far to reach.
When I think all this I praise the LORD Jesus Chirst who did all this in His words.
Above all the universe are created by His words, but we human being are made by His hands and looks like Him.
In the event of His birthday (Dec. 25, you will understand how great our LORD is.
The amaizing thing is He so loved the world and gave is only son to die for our sin.
That is why Jesus came to this world and died for our sin on the cross.
Do you belive in Jesus? Are you born again? Do not for get He will come back.
It took for you days and spent millions dollars to reach not far distance.
But when the LORD come back from a very far light years distance He will reacht to us in Second.
Especally He is very close when we kneel down and prey.
How great is LORD.
Give him praise.

12/23/1999 My friends, I'm sure it has been a great year for all of us - and we have every reason to be thankful for all of the learning experience we have had - good or bad.
I am a Malaysian.
It's really a great opportunity for me to see what you guys are doing through the internet - as for most of us, the less fortunate ones, are unable to share the excitement and challenges you guys have been through.
My only wish is that one day, my people here would be able to catch a glimpse of you guys in action and get a taste of what the wonder of nature and technology have to offer.
Merry Christmas to each and every one of you.
God Bless you and your loved ones as well.
Take care.
Joyce 12/23/1999 Merry Christmas, Take a moment and think about this.
God gives us the power to change the things we can.
God also gives us the power to accept the things we cannot change.
If all people would take a moment and think about that do you think everyone on Earth could see it the way you see it now? Peace on Earth,Good Will to Men.

12/23/1999 Merry Christmas and Godspeed, Discovery.
It's easy to think of shuttle missions as being almost routine, but watching your work on the Hubble Telescope via NASA Television helps those of us still earthbound maintain our sense of how special and important your work is.

Kenneth Parker Camarillo, CA Age 16 12/23/1999 Crewmembers of ST-103: I am aouthorized to send to you a special greeting and Christmas wish to you from the embodiment of the Special Security Division.
The SSD is a Star Trek Fan organization and we follow the paths of NASA and other space agencies.
I am the Director of this organization and the entire membership of this organization sends to you the Merriest Of Holiday Wishes.
The following poem about this Christmas appears in our latest Fanzine and I'd like to share it with you.
CHRISTMAS SOLITUDE Charles P. Teator The hour is early at dark four-thirty, quiet, empty, solitary, almost lonely, a sanctified peace touches the soul of life, as Christmas Eve, Becomes Christmas Morn.
I look to the window, to a peaceful falling snow, covering the Earth in a blanket of white, to warm the heart and soul, granted by the Spiritual Oneness, for whom this day is for.
Through the sleeplessness of this night, beyond this meditation, the Spitit of Christmas, bequeaths an everlasting love, given to all and one, the shared elemental Truth for the Sanctified Peace throughout the land.
Through the frosted pane, to the gentle floating snowflakes, highlighted by the streetlamps, the Spirit of the Day awakens, with Glorious Sanctified Truth.
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas ST-103 from the membership of the Special Security Division, guardians of the future.
Charles P. Teator, Director, Special Security Division 12/23/1999 MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL OF YOU OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU.

Your achievements were phenomenal and your persistence was commendable.
I hope you get to enjoy your families through the holidays after all your hard work and space walks aboard Discovery.
All of us who wish to be astronauts admire your accomplishments and can only imagine how much preparation went into the flight.
God bless you and your families and have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 12/23/1999 We are so proud of our astronauts here in America.
I just wish that more media attention was directed toward the space program.
I have been a fan since the first shuttle mission in '81 and hope to see the day when any American can take a ride into space.

You have given your very best.
We are very grateful for you! Thanks a millenium! 12/23/1999 12/23/99 Hello up There, Have you seen the north pole? I am waiting for my first Christmas and wondering if you have seen SantaClause? I am 11wks old and waiting for my daddy to come honefrom Houston Control, I bet you have little boys and girls waiting at home for you too! God Bless You and Stay Safe! Baby Patrick Lanham 12/23/1999 Best wishes for a safe, productive and successful flight! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! 12/23/1999 From Mexico City, I hope you have a succesfull mission, merry christmas.
12/23/1999 Thanks for the great Christmas present of watching you retool the hubble on the Nasa channel and keeping up with your schedule on Web TV.
It is exciting to see what you are doing.
You make it look so easy! You are brave to commit yourselves to this kind of work.
Have a great Holiday.
Thanks to all those who made it possible for all of us watching to be a part of what you are doing.
The Nasa channel is great! Mrs. Sue Fodor, Lakeland FL 12/23/1999 Take a few minutes to gaze out the window and ask yourself was this all done by random chanch or is there a "higher" power at work in the cosmos.
Is there someone looking down upon you as you gaze down upon us? There was a song sung back in the late sixty's when spaceflight was relatively new by Barry McGuire called the "Eve of Distruction".
The line reads "you may leave here for four days in space but when you return its the same old place".
The times have changed but the "place" has not.
There is still the "bad" things that still happen here on earth but maybe for just a few seconds while you're streaking along at seventeen thousand miles an hour there may be true "peace" on earth.
Cast your shadow of peace upon us o Discovery and may God cast his shadow of peace upon us all and bring us peace and joy this Christmas season now and forevermore.
12/23/1999 Merry Christmas in Space, From earth to space have a very special Christmas.
I know your families and Santa will save all your presents for your return to earth.
Please wave out the window Christmas morning and i'll be looking and wave back.
Merry Christmas, Evan, Theresa and Jack Zaruba Overland Park, Kansas 12/23/1999 Happy Holiday...you have the unique opportunity to view all of the splendor and glory of God's creation.
Blessed Holiday.
12/23/1999 Merry Christmas and Happy New Millenium and thanks for your hard work.
Do you suppose there will ever be a need for psychologists in space? Are there any unique psychological disorders caused by being in space? Orbitting the Earth ...talk about separation anxiety... 12/23/1999 Best of luck on the success of your very important mission! Each day that the Hubble Deep Space Telescope sends pictures of our great Universe back to Earth, everyone receives a gift of knowing that the place in which we live is only a small part of our neighbourhood.
Great work and, most importantly, thank you for sacrificing your holidays so that we can learn a little more about the beauty of the space around our humble little planet.
Merry Christmas! Tracy Hartshorne, Prince George, BC, CANADA.
12/23/1999 Merry Christmas, Discovery! How fitting you launched with 3 "Silver Bells" ringing you into the heavens for this special mission.
Your work gives us all something a little extra to be grateful for this Holiday Season.
I worked the Hubble's initial launch and her first sevicing mission and my heart and thoughts are with you all on this flight.
Good luck and Best Wishes!!! Terri Stowe (League City, TX) 12/23/1999 Greetings: I would like to wish all of you and your families happy holidays, since you will not be down here celebrating them.
I must say, however, I would be glad to sacrifice one family get-together to be in your space-suits.
Ever since I witnessed the tradgedy of the Challenger mission when I was no more than three, I have been captivated by the exploration space.
I could think of no better excuse to miss the Christmas trees, presents and endless lines for Santa Claus in the local malls.
I hope you get that monster of a mechanical eye working so we can catch more glimpses of the universe and its innerworkings.
Perhaps, as space travel becomes more frequent and commericalized, I will be able to experience what you and the rest of the NASA astronauts have been experiencing for the last thirty-five or so years.
And why not throw an AMD Athlon or P3 Coppermine in that beast? I know, testing, besides the 486 was probably one of the most stable procesors created.
Good luck, and have a safe trip home.
Brandon Rigsby and CompUSA Store #341 Nashville, Tennesee 12/23/1999 Dear Shuttle Crew, Santa Clause was wondering if he could borrow several of your space suits (he will have to adapt 10 of them to accommodate the reindeer ,including Rudolph).
He has many presents and wishes of good cheer for you, the brave astronauts -- undaunted explorers -- who are launching our civilization into the next millennium.
We salute you.
The nay-sayers and the naive will fade away, but your endeavors will never be forgotten.
Santa indicated that if you would look out your window into the starlight, you will enjoy the thoughts and spirits of those great thinkers and explorers who led the way ...
Isaac, Johannes, Albert, Galileo, Aristotle, Bart, Immanuel, and friends ... and experience the exhileration of discovery.
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy Millennium.
Thank you for the gifts you are giving to our children and to our species.
12/23/1999 Just a note from a first time visitor from Canada.
good luck on the rest of your mission and all of the best of the holiday season.
May 2000 be filled with memories like those you are making right now.

12/23/1999 Dear Discovery Crew As our world exists today with many people making judgements about only the failures that NASA has, I would like to congratulate your crew on the efforts that you and the rest of the people at NASA are making to make `this a better world and universe to live in.
I know that it is exciting and that your families must all be real proud of your work.
Have a merry christmas, and I know from your vantage point the world is really a pretty awesome place.

Thank you for the effort that you put forth in name of science and exploration.
Have a comfortable and safe journey back to Earth.
Michael Scott 12/23/1999 Nothing serious, just thought (every time I do that it gives me headaches and gets me in trouble) I'd give a bright and cheery "Bah Hubble!" Remember the immortal (or were they immoral) words of the P-3 flight crew who put down at the international airport with their gear up.
"Oh [UNPRINTABLE]! When someone finally decides they really want to find life on Mars, design a space suit for my cat.
I'll have to go along to make certain she doesn't eat it before you can say "Take me to your leader!" Take care 
Your sacrafice will not be forgotten and I wish you and yours the very best in the new year.
Quite often we forget to thank the ones that make a difference for all of us.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE RISK! God speed and see you back on earth.

It's kinda hard being away from the family during the holidays, but just think, somewhere down the road, you'll be able to look back and say, hay in 99" I was watching the most spectacular Christmas card ever made! Come home safe, you are remembered R.E.Robb 12/23/1999 Merry Christmas, Thank you for the job you are doing and the sacrifaces you make, in order to make this a better world to live in.
The reasearch done in space will someday feed us and cure our diseases.
Thank you The Wagners, Bob Sue Whitney.
12/23/1999 Discovery Crew, Greetings and Happy Holidays from Earth! The sacrifice of being away from your families during Christmas must be great, but the work you are doing makes me very proud.
Space is the future of mankind.
I wish you a safe return and success on your mission.

-Louis H. Lietzen 12/23/1999 A very Merry Christmas to all of you "Up There" Where so many would love to be Just Once including me, and also to your families Thank you for continuing the work of our world each day because of the dedication of you and everyone who works with the NASA program one we will know more about ourselves and our world and maybe one day we will all be able to cruise the stars.
Thank you for giving our children a dream and continuing our dream.

Michelle and Rose(wants to be an astronaught when she grows up) 12/23/1999 May Almighty GOD bless you and be with you every moment.
Many thanks to all of you for your important work over this special time of year.
May the hope and joy of Christmas be with you.
Best wishes and Happy New Year! GODs speed! 12/23/1999 Hi Guys! Dec 23, 1999 What better way to spend the Holidays than "working" a shift in orbit.
The spectacular assignment of getting a priceless Hubble telescope back in fully operational condition is one I envey back down here on Terra Firma.
The last inspiring Christmas I vividly remember is one a long time ago, in a Galaxy far far away (ooops, sorry), on a quiet eve when an Apollo crew circled the MOON, beamed back live images of the moon's surface (so near you could almost reach out and touch the craters), and read from a moving passage of literature.
The video of your work in space (for at least a full 8-hour "day") is again riveting.
Thank you for supporting our Merry Christmas down here on this special planet.
I wish you guys the BEST Christmas ever until you return and can celebrate again on the ground.
Well done.
My imagination is once again recharged! Bob Lasch, Shuttle missions fan! 12/23/1999 I was present to watch STS-71 launch in July, 1995.
THat was the most amazing thing that I have ever seen.
I cannot imagine what it is like to be a passenger, much less the commander or pilot when they "go for throttle up".
I hope that you have a great holiday season, even if it is in space.
12/23/1999 Do you feel the space Shuttle has a future or will we develop a new space shuttle that is more efficient and cost effective? brian foubert 12/23/1999 Happy Holidays to you all.
I really admire your dedication to work.
I mean, you gave up Xmas with your families to go to work.
My dream is to be an astronaut, and you make excellent role models for me.
Enjoy your time up there.

GODSPEED AND MERRY CHRISTMAS!! WITH GRATITUDE FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY, THE STAMBAUGH FAMILY ~ STEPHANIE,TONY,ADAM AND NOAH 12/23/1999 GREETINGS FROM CANADA!!! I am writing to you from Red Deer, Alberta, my name is Bob Connolly and I have cerebral palsy.
You live my dream, my room is filled with space pictures and I am so proud of the American space program.
I will be visiting NASA's website often to keep updated on your journeys.
God Bless you and your families during the holidays.
I have followed the space program closely for all my 46 years and am so thrilled at the thought that you may read this message.
It would make my life dream just to know you even read this...as this will be as close to space as I will ever get.
See you in my dreams.....A message back would make my life complete.
12/23/1999 To Our Gallant Astronauts: Your work, as well as those who support you on the ground is extremely important to his country and the world.
In the past all our major advances in technology and medicine have been made as a result of wars our country has fought with others resulting in terrific costs in lives, property and funding.
Now we have NASA and the Space Program, which is costly, but not in lives and property to the extent that our advances cost us in the past.
Know that you are adding to our knowledge of our environment, our earth and our place in the universe.
God Speed and a Very Merry Christmas and a Happy, Healthy and Prosperous New Year 2000.
God Bless You All.

I told my mother that I really would like to go there with you... but it wouldn't be possible.
So be happy!!!!! Kisses and hugs from me.
Danielle 12/23/1999 Just remember that when it's Christmas here...it's well as there are no time zones in space I guess it's always Christmas up there!! Have a good one :) 12/23/1999 Greetings from the Goddard STOCC.
Great work with the RSU changeouts! The gyros powered up just like we expected and continue to operate superbly.
On behalf of the HST PCS team, thanks for relieving us from six weeks of sleep deprivation under Zero Gyro Sunpoint.
It'll be great to get back to science! Good luck with the deploy - we'll be ready to take her back Saturday.

12/23/1999 Good Christmas Merry Christmas there to space wishes Markus VÃ¤kevÃ¤inen from Finland 12/23/1999 To The Crew Of STS-103 (Discovery) Congradulations on the successful work to restore the world's premier astronomical research tool, the Hubble Space Telescope! I'm sure that the late Edwin Hubble has been looking down upon each and every one of you, and the others before you who have maintained this important tool of science and discovery, to help mankind better understand our place in the vast universe.
As you look down upon Earth on Christmas Day 1999, remember our world is a fragile place in which we live.
As you orbit each ninety minutes, you pass many borders, many nations and countless billions of the human race.
May your mission be a symbol for peace, love and universal understanding among all peoples of the world, for it is you, and others to follow that will lead humankind towards the stars! 12/23/1999 Dear Crew of the STS-103, We have been trying to see you go up since October.
We went to Florida for the 12-6-99 lift-off date.
My grampy, Ken Budden, whom you all have worked with on this project has spoke highly of you and wanted us to see you all go up.
We appreciate all that you do for our country.
I know it must be hard to be away from your family for christmas.
So, "I wish you a merry christmas, I wish you a merry christmas, I wish you all a merry christmas, 
Your Space Friends, Amber (4) future engineer Patrick(1) future astronaut Heather 
The Baniak family, PUNTA GORDA, FL. 12/23/1999 Merry Christmas from HUNGARY and have a safe trip back to Earth.

12/23/1999 go for all mankind rhg ralphhg@earethlink.net 12/23/1999 To:Curtis Brown Holiday Greetings From North Carolina Curtis, I saw the shuttle status page and it showed you going 16,500 mile per hour.
If that isn't fast enough to get you qualified in any NASCAR race, I don't know what is.
I was raised in Harnett county, not too far up the road from Elizabethtown.
I have heard NASA refer to the shuttle as the equivalent of a pickup truck.
Good thing they got a good old boy to drive it.
Can we get a John Boy and Billy "A-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah"? Make sure that everyone gets their beer cans out of the payload bay before you land, those NASA security are tough.
Have a Merry Christmas and keep them straight up there.
JT 12/23/1999 Sorry that you can't be with your families for The Holiday.
Good luck with your pending mission.
I hop that it goes well.

12/23/1999 The pictures that the Hubble Space Telescope can get impress everybody , whether he is a fan of space exploration or not , just as the Apollo 8 mission did exactly 31 years ago.
So I hope that you can make it work for many more years , because it is one of the best representatives of space exploration.
Good luck , Merry Christmas and happy new year! Elias Roussos Athens, Greece 12/23/1999 Thanks for fixing the telescope! I watch you guys every night on NASA cable TV here in Seattle and it would drive my wife nuts(in a good sort of way) if you could email her/us a holiday email from the space shuttle.
Happy holidays from us down here on earth! Jesse 
Amicalement, PAILLEX Amael 12/23/1999 Dear Astronaut Heroes: The work you are accomplishing is awe inspiring and very dangerous.
The pictures created by the Hubble telescope in the past have been remarkable beyond words.
Your work on the Hubble will make it possible for more of those pictures beyond words.
God bless you, and God speed.
Be careful, Concerned earthling.
12/23/1999 Just wanted to wish the crew a very merry christmas and let you know that my thoughts are with you as you spend christmas in space.
I can't help but think that in a way it's appropriate that as we draw closer to the year 2000 and the beginning of a new era, your mission is taking place.
It seems clear to me that the greatest advancements of humankind to take place in the next century will be directly linked to our exploration of space.
So thank you for your efforts and once again have a merry christmas.
12/23/1999 You guys have really got some stones..

12/23/1999 Thanks and Good Job! 12/23/1999 Have any of the astronuts worked with mission specialist Joe Tanner on the previous Hubble space repair? The objective appears to be similar (repair/maintenance), is there other aspects that make this mission more unique (ie. any firsts?, never been tried before activities,etc.)?

Hope that the creator is smiling on you and your crew members as you will be missing the holidays with your families but I am sure that your wives are very understanding and patient women waiting for your return.
Although my children are young, I tell them to be proud of the brave souls who work at NASA, especially those of you brave enough to leave the planet.
I am very proud as an American to know] that the Space Programs continue and hope that our next President will find it in their heart to stop spending so much on our multi-billion dollar effort for military spending and contribute a much higher portion of our tax dollars on increasing and expanding our efforts through NASA.
Again, my heart is with you and your families during this final holiday season of the millenium and I wish you all a safe return to earth and your families.
Many blessings to you and your crew! 12/23/1999 Dear hero's I have great respect for your job, and really appreciate how you show that manned spaceflights and science goes hand in hand!

*** WELL DONE !!! *** Working in space is not easy at the best of times, especially as this is an environment that man was not designed for.
Consider yourselves honoured that you are able to venture into God's great arena that we call space, and that you are able to return again to the stage that we call earth to tell about the wonders of what you have seen in that time.
Even though you are far from family and friends at this time, I take the opportunity to wish you a Merry Christmas up there in space, a Safe Landing 
Best Wishes and Regards from SYDNEY - AUSTRALIA ....

May God bless you all and bring you home soon.
Rick, Chris, 
On Christmas Day could you please say a prayer up there for all of us down here on Earth - for Peace On Earth - just like the angels proclaimed ages ago? How awesome it must be to see our Earth from where you are.
Never forget it.
I wish you continued success! Merry Christmas - safe arrival home.
Alison from Long Island, New York (give us a wave) 12/23/1999 I certainly can't imagine the rush of thoughts and feelings which must come over you when you have a chance to relax and contemplate exactly where you are.
But I am envious for at least one reason.
Perhaps better than any place on earth, you are in the best place to truly be quiet and to allow God's presence to penetrate you and let you know He is God.
I pray that you are able to experience, if only for a moment, the immeasureable peace and deep joy of this season.
I also pray that while you are gone, your families are held safe within His arms and also know of our Savior's peace.
Thank you for valuing your duty above your desires.
And may God bless you...everyone.
12/23/1999 I wish you a Merry Christmas even if you are far from home.
Thanks for you work, so that we will be able to see the wonderful HST pictures soon !! Have a nice time in space and greetings from Palermo, Sicily (Italy) Gaetano Bonanno 12/23/1999 From NASA Headquarters Public Affairs: Thanks, guys!

12/23/1999 To the crew of Discovery - Thanks for spending your Christmas on orbit, repairing Hubble; that's what I call 'above and beyond' the call of duty.

We think you are doing a great job and making a huge sacrifice for the benefit of all mankind.

Ed

HAPPY HOLLIDAYS 12/23/1999 A very Merry Christmas and a blessed New Year to brave adventurers who have struck out and paved the way for the people of the new Millenium.
12/23/1999 To the crew on Hubble servicing mission SM3A.
I have been particularly interested in this mission due to the HST being involved.
I am doing a research project on Edwin Hubble and have been reading everything on Mr. Hubble and the HST.
As a former US Navy submariner I know what it is like to only be away from home on Chistmas but to also not be able to contat home on such an important day.
I spent Chistmas ,92 underwater somewhere in the Med.
I noticed that it brings a crew together and makes special bond that can never be replaced.
Happy Holidays and Merry Chirstmas from Conway, Massachusetts Quentin, Elizabeth and our new baby girl Abigail 12/23/1999 To wish you a very Merry Christmas and to say that you are letting us see what a bright future the new century has in store for us! What a time we live in ! Safe return.

Dear NASA,all I want for Christmas is......
12/23/1999 Merry Christmas Discovery! What a wonderful vantage point to see God's handywork! Please be careful and may God grant you a truly wonderful Christmas.
I will pray that all goes well and you return safely when your mission is completed.
Thanks for all you do to help expand our frontiers.

Detroit, MI. Amy Goodman 12/23/1999 TO ALL THE SHUTTLE CRW, CHRISTMAS GREETTINGS.WE JUST WANTED YOU ALL TO KNOW HOW PROUD WE ARE OF YOU FOR DOING SUCH AN IMPORTANT JOB FOR THE USA AND FOR THE SACRIFICE OF BEING AWAY FROM YOUR LOVED ONES ON AT THIS SPECIAL TIME OF YEAR.
OUR THOUGTS AND PRAYERS WILL BE FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES!! THANK YOU SO MUCH THE HAUSNER AND BROWN FAMILIES 12/23/1999 Obviously you don't know me, but hey who's worried! I have to covey my total jealousy of where you are right now.
You are seeing something which I shall never have the chance to see, there isn't much call for a new graduate geologist in space! Still I hope everything has gone smoothly for you, I'm sure it will have done, there have been no news reports in the UK to say otherwise.
I would do almost anything to be able to have the chance to experience what you're doing and seeing, I shall just have to imagine! I wish all of you, all the luck in the world for your future missions! Don't forget if there's a spare seat, I'll be more than happy to fill it!! I hope you all have a fantastic Christmas and an equally good New Year.
Best wishes to you all.

DOES HE LOOK HAPPY? PLEASE WISH HIM A GREAT CHRISTMAS IF YOU SEE HIM. Q.
HOW IS THE SPACE SHUTTLE POWERED, FROM LIFT-OFF TO OUTER SPACE.
ONCE IN ORBIT HOW MUCH FUEL IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ORBIT.
THANK YOU 
If I had one wish , It would be to be able to work outside the shuttle on the Hubble telescope with you.
The pictures of you all working out there is the most awesome sight I will ever see in my lifetime.
It is like looking into
