Identity Thief Goes "Phishing" for Consumers' Credit Information - An identity thief who allegedly used hijacked corporate logos and deceptive spam to con consumers out of credit card numbers and other financial data has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charges that his scam violated federal laws.
The FTC alleged that the scam, called "phishing," worked like this: posing as America Online, the con artist sent consumers e-mail messages claiming that there had been a problem with the billing of their AOL account.
The e-mail warned consumers that if they didn't update their billing information, they risked losing their AOL accounts and Internet access.
The message directed consumers to click on a hyperlink in the body of the e-mail to connect to the "AOL Billing Center."
When consumers clicked on the link they landed on a site that contained AOL's logo, AOL's type style, AOL's colors, and links to real AOL Web pages.
It appeared to be AOL's Billing Center.
But it wasn't.
The defendant had hijacked AOL's identity and was going to use it to steal consumers' identities, as well, the FTC alleged.
An FTC Consumer Alert, "How Not to Get Hooked by a `Phishing' Scam" warns consumers who receive e-mail that claims an account will be shut down unless they reconfirm their billing information not to reply or click on the link in the e-mail.

Fraudulent Bonus Checks For Non-Existent Jobs - The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has learned that some individuals and banks are being victimized by a scheme involving online job applications.
The individuals have applied for and accepted jobs through an online job search service advertising "signing bonuses" of approximately $2,500 to new hires.
Each prospective employee has received a check ranging from $19,000 to $50,000 by mail from the prospective employer with instructions to deposit the check, preferably at an ATM.
The recipient is further instructed to keep $2,000 to $4,000, depending upon the amount of the signing bonus, and return the balance of the money by wire to a location in Europe.
The checks are fraudulent; therefore, the depositor is ultimately responsible for any amounts charged back to his or her account by the bank resulting from the dishonor of the checks.
In some cases, banks have suffered losses when a customer has been unable to cover the overdrafts resulting from the dishonor and return of the fraudulent checks.

Two new schemes target families of those serving in the Armed Forces and e-mail users.
In both schemes, people represent themselves as being from the IRS.
The IRS warns consumers to beware of any variation of a scenario in which a telephone caller posing as an IRS employee tells a family member that he is entitled to a $4,000 refund because his relative is in the Armed Forces and then requests a credit card number to cover a $42 fee for postage.
The scammer provides an actual IRS toll-free number as the call back number in order to make the call seem legitimate.
However, the scammer then makes numerous unauthorized purchases with the victim's credit card number.

Charity Fraud - The Federal Trade Commission announced "Operation Phoney Philanthropy" - a law enforcement and public education campaign by the FTC and state charities regulators to stop fraudulent fundraising.

A person or group of persons carrying on business as the Maryland Investments Club is offering cashable guaranteed investment certificates called "digital investment certificates" for sale over the Internet.

Scam Artists Use Do Not Call Registry to Commit Fraud - Scam artists capitalizing on the popularity of existing state "Do Not Call" lists and the proposed FTC "Do Not Call" registry have devised yet another method to trick consumers into giving up personal information, such as their Social Security number, bank account number, credit card number or telephone calling card number.
Here's how the scam works: someone calls you claiming to represent a "Do Not Call" registry or the FTC.
The phony registry "official" asks for your personal information, supposedly to verify that you are on the "Do Not Call" list.
The caller is a con artist who could use your personal information to run up debts in your name or otherwise steal your identity.
Once a consumer signs up with a state's actual "Do Not Call" registry, there is no need to confirm personal information.

Colorado Attorney General Warns Colorado Consumers to be Wary of Scams Related to No-Call List - Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar issued a warning to Colorado consumers to be wary of telephone calls purporting to "verify" their registration with a telemarketing no-call list.
Complaints have surfaced about certain entities contacting Colorado consumers to "verify" placement on a no-call List.
A company calling itself the "National Association Against Fraud" is requesting credit card information to verify an Internet request to be placed on a no-call list.
Another company, believed to be called "Fraud Stoppers", has contacted consumers seeking bank account verification information related to no-call services.
These types of solicitations are completely fraudulent and are unrelated to Colorado's official No-Call law which goes into effect on July 1st.
Consumers should not respond to these types of calls by providing a credit card number or other personal financial information.
To place their telephone number on Colorado's official No-Call list, consumers need only call 1-888-249-9097 or they can register on-line.
Sign-up is completely free.

Tax Hoax - Here's a new Internet hoax that has the potential to be a real scam.
It's been reported that some taxpayers have received e-mail from a non-IRS source indicating that the taxpayer is under audit and needs to complete a questionnaire within 48 hours to avoid the assessment of penalties and interest.
The e-mail refers to an "e-audit" and references the IRS Form 1040.
The taxpayer is asked for social security numbers, bank account numbers, and other confidential information.
Although these reports are apparently only an urban legend, taxpayers should be aware that the IRS does not conduct e-mail audits.
Never provide sensitive personal information in response to such e-mails.

Bank debits are particularly high in certain categories among the top ten telemarketing frauds in 2001: 62 percent of consumers paid for bogus credit card offers with bank debits; 50 percent gave out their bank numbers in the increasingly popular age-old Nigerian money offer scam; and 26 percent had funds withdrawn from their bank accounts for buyers clubs they never agreed to purchase.

In many cases, investors are lured to these notes since they are billed as "risk free" and bonded by foreign insurance companies, which are often fake.
Local insurance agents who have previous relationships with the investors usually sell the notes.

FTC Settles with Marketers of Bogus International Driver's Licenses - Two companies settled FTC charges that they fraudulently marketed purportedly authentic International Driver's Permits (IDPs) on the Internet.
Under the terms of the settlement, the defendants are prohibited from future marketing of any IDPs or identification documents.
The suit alleged that the defendants deceptively claimed that consumers could use the phony IDPs they marketed on their Web site to drive legally in the United States, to insulate them from sanctions for traffic violations, and as a government photo identification.
These so-called international driver's licenses don't give you the legal right to drive, won't help you remove points from your license, and aren't an official government ID. Authentic IDPs enable a person with a valid driver's license to drive in foreign countries that have signed the 1949 United Nations Road Traffic Convention.
The IDP is a simple booklet that translates a consumer's government-issued driver's license into different languages; it is not a substitute for a valid, government-issued license.
It cannot be used in place of a suspended or revoked license or as a government-issued identification card.
Further, it will not protect consumers from traffic tickets or "points."
In the United States, legitimate IDPs cost $10 each, and can only be obtained from the American Automobile Association and the American Automobile Touring Alliance.
