The convening was the result of a dialogue between Hmong/Mong leaders and the Secretary and her staff in which a request for assistance on behalf of Hmong/Mong students was brought forward.
A planning committee of community leaders and OSE staff constructed an agenda for the day which included presentations on the historical/bckground perspective of the Hmong/Mong community by Dr. Paoze Thao, Liberal Studies Professor, Collaborative Education and Professional Studies at California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) and Lee Pao Xiong, President and CEO of The Urban Coalition, a research, education and advocacy organization working on behalf of low-income communities and communities of color in Minnesota.
In addition, Hmong/Mong parents were invited to provide testimony about their personal challenges with the educational system and school districts were asked to present information on promising strategies for increasing the academic achievement of Hmong/Mong students.
Representatives of the Hmong/Mong communities throughout the Central Valley attended the convening.
In addition, representatives from twelve school districts attended.
The stated goal among all of the attendees was the increased educational achievement of Hmong/Mong students in California.
Background
Prior to the convening, the Office of the Secretary for Education collected available data on the Hmong/Mong student population.
As shown in Figure 1, in 2001, there were 33,870 Hmong/Mong students in California, down from a high of 38,062 in 1997.
(Fig. 1) Other findings: * Of the total, 27,124, or 81 percent, are designated as English Language Learners (ELLs).
* Hmong/Mong is the third most common primary language among ELLs statewide.
* Thirty-one school districts enrolled 100 plus Hmong/Mong students, accounting for 91 percent of the statewide total.
* Below are the six largest school districts serving Hmong/Mong students, accounting for a total of 19,344 students, representing 63 percent of Hmong/Mong English Language Learners statewide.
* Over one-half of California Hmong/Mong students reside in Fresno and Sacramento counties.

OSE staff also surveyed a number of school districts.
The survey shows a wide variance in the type of information maintained by districts specific to Hmong/Mong students and employees.
Currently, the state offers several programs in support of English language learners, including: * The English Language and Intensive Literacy Program.
* The state's first English Language Development Assessment, known as CELDT.
* The English Language Acquisition Program, providing students with instructional support.
* Resources and tools to help educators properly evaluate student achievement and focus improvement.
Unfortunately, in its current form the state's pupil testing program, STAR, does not disaggregate results for Hmong/Mong students.
We do have results from the CELDT, an assessment of English proficiency in speaking/listening, reading and writing.
As shown in the Figure 2, 58 percent of Hmong/Mong students tested in the beginning to early intermediate categories.

Convening Proceedings
Secretary Mazzoni welcomed the attendees and spoke about Governor Davis' commitment to the educational achievement of all of California's children.
The Secretary covered a number of educational reforms implemented by the current administration and noted the rise in test scores for California students.
The Secretary also spoke about the need to intensify the efforts for students who are not succeeding.
She discussed the need for increased parental involvement, home to school communication, and the use of best practices such as home visitation in reaching our high goals for all students.
The Secretary finished by looking at the day as a first step to addressing the challenges faced by Hmong/Mong students and their families and even using the results as a template when looking the needs of other recent immigrant cultures and the challenges they face in the public school system.
The conference then heard testimony from a Hmong/Mong parent about the difficulties he was having communicating with his son's school.
While the testimony highlighted many of the challenges resulting from differences in language and culture, it clearly defined a problem in communication that was a significant deterrent to the academic achievement of the individual's son and put light on very reasons and need for the conference itself.
Dr. Paoze Thao, Professor of Liberal Studies at CSUMB, provided an extensive presentation on Hmong/Mong history and culture and discussed many of the critical issues facing the Hmong/Mong population.
It contained invaluable information on the differences in Hmong/Mong language between groups that is vital to educators looking to better communicate with their students' parents both orally and in written form.
Dr. Thao spoke eloquently about the difficulties that Hmong/Mong students face straddling the culture of their parents and grandparents and the pressures of growing up in the United States.
Lee Pao Xiong, President and CEO of The Urban Coalition, presented information from Minnesota's experience in working with the Hmong/Mong population in St. Paul the the largest Hmong/Mong population in the country.
Among the information presented by Lee Pao Xiong were the following: * 45,000 Hmong/Mong reside in Minnesota (the number may be higher the the Hmong/Mong community contends that census figures are inaccurate).
* Largest centralized group of Hmong/Mong in the United States live in Minnesota.
* The average age of Hmong/Mong is 15 years.
* Of the 13.000 Asian students attending Minnesota public schools, 11,000 are Hmong/Mong.
He also discussed strategies that have been successful in promoting school-parent communication, relationship building and increased academic achievement, including: * School site base management, which allows parental involvement in the allocation of funds and school management.
The Urban Coalition utilized community trainers to assist parents in understanding how to successfully participate in these meetings.
* Identification of key opinion leaders in the community to speak about and highlight the issues for community members and school officials.
* Partnerships with other organizations with the same interest in student achievement, adding weight and leverage to all of the partners' concerns.
* For students and parents: mentors, skill assessments, and possible career options after high school.
* Building relationships between local foundations and schools.
* Creating a Hmong/Mong parent-teacher organization.
Parents feel that language barriers prevent fair and equitable treatment.
* Creating a Hmong/Mong library.
Minnesota received funding for a library, parenting classes, and mentoring.
* Establishing a "hot-line" for parents to get questions answered in Hmong/Mong language.
* Hiring Hmong/Mong administrators in school system.
Overall, there is a need to focus on the capacity of the public to understand and address challenges facing the Hmong/Mong community.
These issues need to be brought forward through multiple means.
There also exists a need for more Hmong/Mong to be hired as teachers, administrators and elected officials.
Lee concluded by stating that he feels there remains a "colonialism" mentality in the United States, and that there is a perception that the "White way is the right way".
He feels the best way to bridge this disconnect is through greater cultural sensitivity training

Attendee Participation
Members of the conference were then invited to present promising or best practices in the educational field.
These included:
Lee Vang, Vice-Principal of Pacific Elementary School in Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD), discussed the Hmong/Mong Extended Summer School Program.
Started in 1999, the program provides assistance with reading, language, and English Language skills.
In addition, this program seeks to build positive attitudes in its students.
The Hmong/Mong summer school program also includes volunteer tutors, Hmong/Mong culture curriculum and introductions allowing parents to meet their child's teacher.
Students were pre- and post tested after the summer school programs.
Students enrolled in the program showed larger increase than their peers.
Paul Guervara of Merced Unified School District (MUSD), mentioned that Merced has undertaken large training sessions for parents to attend a "parenting academy", funded by Federal Grants to provide assistance with every day math and science.
MUSD is also currently in the process of developing family science in cooperation with California State University, Stanislaus.
Renee Cunningham of Marysville Unified School District discussed an innovative way of reaching out to parents in her district.
After 'notes home' did not work, the district made videos in the appropriate language that were sent home.
As a result, parent participation increased significantly.
Jain Yang of Fresno Unified School District spoke briefly of utilizing Title 7 grants to hire a consultant to teach English.
Carol Sharp, Principal of Susan B Anthony Elementary (70 % Hmong/Mong), also in Sacramento City Unified School District, has implemented many policies, including: * Saturday School: 22 Saturdays a year are available for Hmong/Mong and Spanish speaking children.
* School newspapers are printed and disseminated in three languages, including Hmong/Mong.
* Meetings are conducted with earphones that allow interpretation in three languages --Hmong/Mong, Spanish, and Russian.
* Susan B Anthony Elementary is also the founding school for the district wide home visitation program.
So far, staff have visited 1600 homes.
Dr. Lue Vang commented on the need for districts to share information and focus on the needs of Hmong/Mong students.
Recommendations and Next Steps
The Conference culminated with a discussion of next steps.
All agreed on the need for a statewide Advisory Committee that would include representatives of the schools districts and the Hmong/Mong Community.
The Advisory Committee would be charged with disseminating best practices and develop recommendations both for the state and local education leaders.
The Advisory Committee would be assembled over the summer and meet in the fall after the beginning of the new school year.
