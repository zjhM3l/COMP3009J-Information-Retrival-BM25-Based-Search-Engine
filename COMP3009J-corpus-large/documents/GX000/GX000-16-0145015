The Counseling and Student Support Office offers a wide range of student services that impact the academic, career, and personal/social development of students necessary to ensure success in school and in life.
This office supports school counseling, psychological, and social services; attendance improvement; dropout prevention and recovery; and foster youth programs.
The Counseling and Student Support Office serves also as a resource to support schools in planning, implementing, and monitoring comprehensive student support programs.
* Bullying and Hate-Motivated Behavior Prevention Bullying by students and its negative effects erode students' ability to learn.
Additionally, the link between bullying and later delinquent and criminal behavior has been documented by research in both the United States and abroad.
The prevalence of bullying and the damage it causes have been seriously underestimated in the past and the Counseling and Student Support Office has developed and collected resources intended to raise awareness of educators, parents, and children.
These resources include how to identify and discuss bullying and how to differentiate between physical and psychological aggression, why bullies bully, bullying and the law, and how bullying can be prevented or diminished.

Child welfare and attendance combines the knowledge and skill of counseling with knowledge of education and the law to resolve complicated situations involving school choice, student discipline, campus safety, and programs for high-risk youth.
Resources include the School Attendance Review Boards (SARB) Handbook.

The guide and accompanying regional training address a wide range of student behavior problems that must be overcome in order to create "environments conducive to learning," as required in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 (NCLB).
The fact that in some schools, teachers regularly face problem behaviors, but seldom receive systemic support for efforts to improve it, launched the more recent publication entitled: Teaching Alternative Behaviors Schoolwide.
This document explores how schools can create a foundation of support and schoolwide commitment to teach students self-discipline and how to behave.
