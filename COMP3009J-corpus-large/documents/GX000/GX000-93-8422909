Green Party
The Green Party believes that California needs a new political vision.
Politics in California have become unresponsive to the needs, desires and well-being of the public.
The Green Party seeks a vision that rises above cynicism or greed.
We recognize and value the common good, and seek to promote the long-term advantage of all people of this state.
We believe that the issues facing all of us are connected;
The need for fairness for people and local communities in developing economic opportunities, instead of continually favoring big corporations and other concentrations of wealth and power; and a fair, equitable, progressive tax system.
Balancing the needs of the present with concern for the kind of world we are leaving for future generations, through a true understanding of how we are affecting our environment.
Food, air, water, and land must be clean and safe.
There must be universal access to education and health care.
The recognition of the sanctity of life, while defending women's right to choose.
Improving democracy in our political system by increasing fairness in our elections through proportional representation and by reforming how campaigns are financed.
GREEN PARTY OF CALIFORNIA 1008 10th Street, #482 Sacramento, CA 95814 (916) 448-3437 E-mail: gpca@greens.org Web Site: http://www.greens.org/california Libertarian Party Around the country, more than 230 Libertarians are in office today, proving that libertarians can be idealistic, yet practical, and still get elected.
In California, Simi Valley and Moreno Valley City councilwomen Sandi Webb and Bonnie Flickinger are fine examples, as is Calaveras Board of Supervisors member Tom Tryon.
Do libertarians represent your viewpoint? Here's a simple test.
In the 1996 election, did you support both Prop 209 (to end racial preferences) and Prop 215 (to legalize medical marijuana)? If so, you're a natural libertarian.
Are you annoyed at incumbent politicians who keep trying to overturn these votes? Do you believe, like most people, that government usually does the wrong thing?
Join with us.
Help us end the state income tax.
Help us reduce crime by ending the War on Drugs.
Help us privatize education and safeguard the right to keep arms.
Libertarians stand for free, peaceful citizens taking responsibility for their lives, their families and their communities.
libertarians support all ten of the Bill of Rights.
Libertarians stand for freedom of choice.
If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always gotten.
Are you satisfied with the government you're getting? If not, vote Libertarian.

Republican Party
Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican President, fought to protect the freedoms off every American citizen.
The Californian Republican Party shares his vision and spirit of fairness.
We are working hard to see that all of California's people are empowered with the opportunity to enjoy the American dream.
Today, the California Republican Party is fighting for:
* Better Schools for our children.
Parents, teachers and local school boards should decide what's best for our children - not the state education bureaucracy in Sacramento.
* Safe Neighborhoods, victims' rights and tougher criminal laws.
No one is free if they feel threatened in their own homes and communities.
* Lower Taxes and an accountable, efficient government responsive to the people who pay their salaries.
We feel that California's government today should be more like a business that serves you well.
Your government should not be a burden in your life - saddling you with excessive taxes and regulations.
We are working for our state's future and to assure that every Californian has the same opportunities to succeed regardless of race of ethnicity.
Please join us as we work together to build a brighter, more prosperous California.
