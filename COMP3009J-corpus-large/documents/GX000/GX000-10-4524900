Official Bio - Steve Chien
Dr. Steve Chien is Technical Group Supervisor of the Artificial Intelligence Group and Principal Computer Scientist in the Exploration Systems Autonomy Section at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology where he leads efforts in automated planning and scheduling for space exploration.
Dr. Chien is also an Adjunct Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science of the University of Southern California and a Visiting Scholar at UCLA.
He holds a B.S. with Highest Honors in Computer Science, with minors in Mathematics and Economics, M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science, all from the University of Illinois.
He was the Program Chair for the 1997 NASA Workshop on Automated Planning and Scheduling for Space Exploration and Science ( NASAPS97) and is Program Co-chair for the 2000 Workshop on the same topic (NASAPS2000).
Dr. Chien was Workshops Chair for the 1998 Conference on AI Planning Systems(AIPS98). and a Co-chair for the 2000 Conference on Artificial Intelligence Planning and Scheduling ( AIPS2000).
He is former chair of the AIPS Executive Council (2000-2002), and is a member of the ICAPS Executive Council (2002-2006).
He is President of the ICAPS Executive Council (2002-2004).
He is also a councilor for AAAI (2003-2006)
Dr. Chien was a recipient of the 1995 Lew Allen Award for Excellence, JPLs highest award recognizing outstanding technical achievements by JPL personnel in the early years of their careers.
In 1997, he received the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal for his work in research and development of planning and scheduling systems for NASA.
He is the Team Lead for the ASPEN Planning System , which received Honorable Mention in the 1999 Software of the Year Competition and was a contributor to the Remote Agent System which was a co-winner in the same 1999 competition.
In 2000, he received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal for service and leadership in research and deployment of planning and scheduling systems for NASA.
Dr. Chien has presented invited seminars on machine learning, planning, scheduling, and expert systems, has authored numerous publications in these areas, and serves as a consultant to several multinational corporations in these areas.
His current research interests lie in the areas of:
planning and scheduling, machine learning, operations research, and decision theory
