Thank you for taking this time to be such a service.
God be with you and your families.

In a world where things seem to be turned upside down at times, our children, our youth, and even our adults, have someone to look up to as role models.
You guys are doing a great job! Godspeed, and Merry Christmas! Scott

So my hats off to all of you and everyone that supports you in your mission of preserving the future of mankind.
I wish you and your families as well as all of mankind, a Marry Christmas and best wishes in The New Millennium and beyond.

What a fantastic way to spend Christmas.
As a retired NCO from the Air Force I know being away from families is tough, but this is one 'TDY' that has got to be the exception.
My hat is off to all of you, I know your training for space flight is intense and takes an enormous sacrafice by each of you and your families.
I for one appreciate all you do.
Thanks for servicing the Hubble Space Telescope, it is truly a wonder and well worth the price.
The knowledge being gained from it is priceless and the photos are breathtaking.
I wish you a joyous reunion with your families when you return and hope you all a Happy New Year.
God bless.
Rick Campbell, SMSgt, USAF, Ret. P.S.

12/24/1999 I suppose that, even though you wont have christmas trees aboard the shuttle, the earth it's self makes for one heck of a light show.
And hey, your responsibility, on christmas day, rivals that of the Big Red Guy himself.
so theres that too.
But i guess the best part of your mission will be getting home.
All of us back here on Earth watch with anticipation while you install these new components in Hubble so that we can enjoy more of the wonder that is our universe.
Come home safe Discovery Crew.
Someone will hold dinner for you.
12/24/1999 Merry Christmas SM3A members! You've got the best view for "Peace on Earth, Good will towards men."

Having grown-up in Cupertino in the 60's an awestruck fan of the space program (my Dad worked at Lockheed and I followed all flights religiously) I can only hope that all people come to better understand the difficulties involved in space exploration -- and the rewards to humankind -- and continue to support these efforts.
Best wishes for a safe return and an exciting New Year full of peace, adventure and discovery.

Je suis la recherche de la webcam embarque bord de la navette car je me suis dit que peut-etre de la haut vous pouviez voir le pere noel.
Ce n'est pas une blague mais une invitation faite via un webzine local, pour une sorte de defi pour que chacun apprenne a mieux maitriser les recherches sur le net.
Au passage je crois que j'ai trouve ce que je cherchais, mais ai du telecharger un plug-in et maintenant j'y retourne.
En passant sur une page proposant de vous adresser un message de noel, c'est de tout coeur que je vous envoie ces quelques mots.
Tout cela demontre un peu que le pere noel existe bien un peu quelque part.

Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village thought.
He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near.
Between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound is the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark, and deep; but I have promises to keep.
And miles to go before I sleep.
And miles to go before I sleep.
*Robert Frost* Wishing for you all a Merry Christmas and a safe return home.

Michael Foale dear sir have a safe trip and well done to you yet again.
could you send a signed photo if possible 12/24/1999 Dear Crew: Happy Holidays to all.
Having grown up almost concurrent with the space age, one of my most profound Christmas memories was of that wonderful Christmas broadcast of Apollo 8 in 1968, hearing the crew inspire the world during their groundbreaking trip to the Moon.
What an experience to be given such a perspective on our world and the universe! I am so happy to have been witness to that.
If you feel isolated during this holiday, know that our thoughts are with you and that your efforts on Hubble are invaluable to all who support space research.
I hope you have a moment either during and EVA or with dim lights, to gaze at the starriest sky ever, and take a look for us all at the awesome beauty of creation on this Christmas, 1999.
Sincerely, Kevin Zimmermann 12/24/1999 Happy New Year !!! From Russia My name is George.
12/24/1999 I would like to wish you all a very happy holiday! I am a Earth Science teacher who just graduated Dec. 18th and I frequently visit the NASA web sites and look up at the stars.

I am sure that all of your families will be missing you on your mission but I want you to know that others are also thinking of you during the holidays.
Good Luck and take care.

And there was light.And God saw the light,that it was good.And God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the dakness He called Night.And the evening and the morning were the first day.And God said,"Let there be firmament in the midst of the waters,and let it divide the waters from the waters".And God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmamnet from the which were above the firmament.
And it was so.And God called the firmament Heaven.And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said,"Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place,and let the dry land appear."And it was so.And God called the dry land earth; and the gathering together of the waters He called the seas; and God saw that it was good."

Love to you. dgypsy 12/24/1999 Dear Shuttle crew; It is my hope that space exploration will bring us to a point in our human evolution that will ultimately prevent us from fighting over what is left here on Earth.
By involving more and more countries in this exciting study, we can share ownership of space.
It is the one science that all school children can be part of.
We all realize that the important work you are doing has significance for our future survival and growth.
Thank you all very much.
I built the largest observatory in the state of Maine and watch the sky every clear night with anticipation of graet things to come.
I am trying to bring the study of astronomy into area schools.
You are bringing discoveries home to all these young future explorers.
I wish I could be up there with you.
Much love to you all! 12/24/1999 Happy Holidays! The sacrifice you make by being away from your families is helping to make a real difference for everyone on earth.
We may not always look or sound so; but we do appreciate the work you do and the miracles you accomplish in our name.
Have a safe trip home and happy celebrations with your families.
12/24/1999 Great job guys! I've been tracking your progress and I am very proud of the job that you are doing.

Cngratulations on a job well done! I do not take your very fine work for granted and never will.

I remember him coming to my Junior High and talking all about the mission.
He even had a picture of southern Indiana from space where Bedford, my hometown, was visible.
I think the work you guys do is amazing, and I don't think the United States gives NASA enough credit for it.
Best wishes for a safe return, and Merry Christmas.
May God bless you.

Walter John Slack Death Valley 12/24/1999 Merry Holiday Greetings! Wish you were here? - in the midst of the last minute shopping, traffic jams, people losing their tempers, families gathering to recreate old dynamics, and everyone KNOWING we're supposed to be happy, but ... sometimes, for some of us, it's hard to do - I think Christmas in space sounds glorious - it must be quiet, and beautiful, too.
Can you see the moon and is it full from space, too? Have a happy, quiet, holiday without family psychodrama or traffic jams.

12/24/1999 To Claude Nicollier: You cannot imagine how happy you have made the 449 workers of the Toblerone chocolate factory in Bern, Switzerland, by having choosen to take with you in the sky Toblerone chocolate! We are working hard every day to produce the whole Toblerone sold throughout the world... and today some bars are even orbiting in the space! Almost unbelievable for us! We thank you warmly and wish you and the whole crew a merry Christmas.
And when you are once in Bern, we would be very proud to welcome you in our factory.
Maybe you could even mould your own Toblerone! The Toblerone Factory Manager, Volker Fischbach 12/24/1999 Hi guys, I really wish I could be up there with you - what a fantastic way to spend the holiday! You're doing a great job, Hubble has been such an important tool and played its part in a new golden age for astronomy.
Now it can continue that work and I,m looking forward to seeing some of the images it will return.
I hope you have a good time on orbit and then have some time to relax with families and friends - you'll deserve it! Thanks from St Neots in the UK (near Cambridge), Chris 12/24/1999 Sorry, I'm an Italian and my english is not good!!! Do you know Verona ? Romeo

12/24/1999 MERRY CHRISTMASS TO YOU ALL AND LONG LIFE TO HUBBLE 12/24/1999 Granges VS CH, 24 dcembre 1999 To Mr Claude Nicollier and the team (but in french).
Cher M.Nicollier, C'est en voyant ces images de l'espace que pour la deuxime fois de l'anne une personnalit suisse nous fait rver.
Aprs le tour du monde de M. Bertrand Piccard c'est vous qui nous persuadez que non seulement il est possible d'accder un rve, mais que ce rve est possible pour chacun, son chelle, de raliser ou de concrtiser l'objectif dont on s'est fix.
Il y a peu de temps, je suis tomb sur une petite phrase qui disait : "Crois en la magie de tes rves"...
Mercredi 22 dcembre 1999, la lune brillait de son plus bel clat en Valais (Suisse), elle tait merveilleuse, plus grande, plus magestueuse que jamais...
C'est donc en associant cette Lune et "la magie de ces rves" que je me permets de tout simplement vous remercier.
Vous nous prouvez qu'avec de l'ambition, du travail et de la volont nos rves peuvent se raliser.
Je vous souhaite vous ainsi qu' tous vos cohquipiers un Joyeux Nol et de bonnes ftes de fin d'anne.
Continuez de nous faire rver et surtout nous prouver que nos nos rver ne sont pas toujours que pure folie...
Merci et bon retour sur notre bonne vieille plante et pour quoi pas en Suisse !!! 12/24/1999 We who believe in space exploration can't thank you enough.Low earth orbit today is good experience for exploring the solar system tomorrow.Onward to Mars!Happyand peaceful Holidays.
