B. Operation Buccaneer Operation Buccaneer is an ongoing international copyright piracy investigation and prosecution undertaken by federal law enforcement.
On December 11, 2001, in a coordinated international effort, the U.S. Customs Service and the Department of Justice executed, or caused to be executed, more than 65 searches in the U.S. and five foreign countries.
As of October, 2002, 16 defendants have been convicted in the U.S. of felony criminal copyright offenses, including conspiracy to commit those offenses, and 13 defendants have been sentenced to federal prison terms of up to 46 months.
These are the longest sentences ever imposed in the United States for Internet copyright piracy.
Additional guilty pleas and sentencings are scheduled in the coming months.

C. Operation "Counter Copy" In early May, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation released the first results of a nationwide law enforcement effort to crack down on trademark and copyright fraud, which is estimated to cost American businesses millions of dollars each year and cheat unsuspecting consumers who purchase counterfeit products.
As a result of the joint effort, called Operation "Counter Copy," 35 indictments were returned since the beginning of April for copyright or trademark infringement.
More information about Operation Counter Copy, including a press release and brief summaries of the cases, are available via the links below.
