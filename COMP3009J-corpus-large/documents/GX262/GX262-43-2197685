FY 2001 Mass Media Regulatory Fees The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the payment of regulatory fees in FY 2001.
If you are a licensee or permittee in any of the mass media services, you should carefully review this Public Notice.
WHO MUST PAY REGULATORY FEES IN FY 2001 Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in FY 2001.
This Public Notice concerns the following Mass Media licensees: commercial AM 
Noncommercial educational licensees are exempt from regulatory fees as are licensees of auxiliary broadcast services such as low power auxiliary stations, television auxiliary service stations, remote pickup stations and aural broadcast auxiliary stations where such licenses are used in conjunction with commonly owned non-commercial educational stations.
Emergency alert system (EAS) licenses for auxiliary service facilities are also exempt as are Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) licensees.
Governments and nonprofit entities (exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code) are not required to pay regulatory fees and should not submit payment.
The Commission requires that each exempt entity submit, or have on file with the Commission, a current IRS Determination Letter documenting its nonprofit status, a certification of governmental authority, or certification from a governmental authority attesting to its exempt status.
The regulatory fee to be assessed is based upon the nature of the authorization (e.g. construction permit or license) held as of October 1, 2000.
Responsibility for payment of that fee rests with the current holder of the permit or license at the time payment is due.
A regulatee is responsible for summing all of its services in order to determine if a fee is due.
If the sum of all services owed is less than $10, then the regulatee is exempt from paying the fee.
WHY THE COMMISSION MUST COLLECT REGULATORY FEES The requirement to collect annual regulatory fees is contained in Public Law 103-66, "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993."
These regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, are used to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public information, international and policy and rulemaking activities.
These fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or other authorization from the Commission.
1
WHEN FEES WILL BE DUE FEE PAYMENTS MAY BE SUBMITTED PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 10, 2001 Regulatory fee payments may be made to Mellon Bank at any time through September 21, 2001.
Payments received after 11:59 PM on September 21, 2001 will be assessed a 25% late payment fee.
As in previous years, there will be a formal window for the acceptance of regulatory fees between September 10, 2001 and September 21, 2001.
However, unlike in prior years, the Commission will, for the convenience of payers, accept fee payments made in advance of that window.
IMPORTANT FY 2001 CHANGES FOR REGULATORY FEE FILERS The Remittance Advice 159 has been revised to accept payer and applicant FCC Registration Numbers (FRN).
We recommend that you begin using the registration number with all payments to the Commission.
If you do not yet have an FRN, you can obtain one through the FCC website listed below, or by filling out the registration form (Form 160) enclosed in this public notice.
If at the time of submission you still do not have an FRN number, and do not wish to obtain one either through the FCC website or by submitting Form 160, you must submit your payment using the July 1997 Form 159 and include your Tax Identification Number (TIN) or other identifier.
You can obtain the July 1997 Form 159 through the FCC website (http://www.fcc.gov/formpage.html) or by calling the Forms Room, who will then fax or mail you a copy of this version of Form 159.
Please note that future transactions with the FCC will require the use of the FCC FRN number.
Therefore, we encourage you to obtain and use the FCC FRN as soon as possible.
To obtain Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· a revised Remittance Advice 159: A revised Remittance Advice 159 is included in this package Go to http://www.fcc.gov/formpage.html.
Call the FCC's Form Distribution Center at 1-800-418-FORM [3676].
Pick up the form at the Commission in Room TW-B200 Call CORES Helpdesk at 1-877-480-3201.
The Commission first began accepting FCC FRN registration numbers after July 19, 2000.
As was the case last year, we are encouraging all payers to obtain and use the FRN when submitting their payment of regulatory fees.
If you were registered in the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau's Universal Licensing System (ULS) and your registration included all the information we needed to issue a Registration Number, we preregistered you and mailed you your FRN in a letter dated last July (2000).
You may want to check CORES to determine if you are still registered.

To obtain a Registration Number: Â· Register at www.fcc.gov, click on E-Filing at the top of the page, and scroll down to the CORES Registration link.
Â· Check your pre-assigned number at www.fcc.gov, click on E-Filing at the top of the page, and scroll down to the CORES Registration link.
Â· File FCC Form 160, (CORES Registration) which is included in this package.
You may obtain the form at http://www.fcc.gov/formpage.html or by calling the FCC's CORES Helpdesk at 1-877-480-3201.
You may also pick up the form in Commission Room TW-B200.
Mailing instructions are on the form.
If you are unable to register electronically, you can still submit your application for a Registration Number (FCC Form 160) directly to Mellon Bank (along with your filing documents and payment), or fax the FRN registration form to the CORES Helpdesk at (202) 418-7869.
Mellon will register you and you will receive a confirmation letter from the FCC through the U.S. Postal Service mail.

For example, last year's code of "0032" is now "0132"for FY 2001.
The codes for FY 2001 are listed in the back of this notice under the section, Special Instructions for Completing FCC Forms 159 and 159-C.
To assure proper credit for your regulatory fees, please be sure to use the codes for FY 2001.
IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR LICENSEES OF CLASS A TELEVISION SERVICE In a recent rulemaking proceeding, (Establishment of a Class A TV Service, 65 FR 29985, MM Docket No. 00-10 (May 10, 2000), a category of "Class A TV" was established that re-classified some of the Low Power TV (LPTV) stations.
For purposes of regulatory fees, we are categorizing the Class A TV service as a derivative of Low Power TV (LPTV).
Stations that were re-classified as Class A TV as of October 1, 2000, as well as existing LPTV stations operating as of October 1, 2000, should pay the LPTV fee of $305 for FY 2001.

Licensees are solely responsible for accurately accounting for all licenses and for paying proper regulatory fees.
Any data omission, erroneous or incomplete data submission, or payment deficiency may result in a 25% monetary penalty, dismissal of pending actions, and/or revocation of any authorization.
You are strongly urged to submit your payments on time and accurately in order to avoid a penalty.
Additionally, the Commission will invoke any lawful authority it may possess under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 to collect any fees due or outstanding against any licensee failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations.
WAIVERS, REDUCTIONS AND DEFERMENTS OF REGULATORY FEES The Commission will consider requests for waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees, in extraordinary and compelling circumstances only, upon a showing that such action overrides the public interest in reimbursing the Commission for its regulatory costs.
Your regulatory fee must be paid by the due date even if a request is made for a waiver or reduction.
This will ensure efficient collection in situations where a waiver or reduction is not warranted and will allow the requestor to avoid a 25% latepayment penalty if its request is denied.
The regulatory fee will be refunded later if the request is
5
granted.
Only in exceptional or compelling instances (where payment of the regulatory fee along with the waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community or other financial hardship to the licensee), will the Commission accept a petition to defer payment along with a waiver or reduction request.
All requests for deferments must be received by September 21, 2001, to avoid the 25% late-payment penalty.
Please submit your written waiver or reduction request to the following address: Office of the Managing Director Federal Communications Commission 445 12th Street, S.W., Room 1-A625 Washington, D.C. 20554 attn: Regulatory Fee Waiver/Reduction Request However, submit your regulatory fee payment to the address on page 4 of this Public Notice.
