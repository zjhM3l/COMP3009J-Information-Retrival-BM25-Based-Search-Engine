INTRODUCTION In order to reduce acid rain in the United States and Canada, Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established the Acid Rain Program.
The program will cut sulfur dioxide emissions in half and substantially reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from electric utility plants.
To achieve these reductions at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both traditional regulatory techniques and innovative, market-based approaches.
The centerpiece of the program is the allowance trading system, under which affected utility units are allocated "allowances" (each "allowance" permits a utility to emit one ton of SO2) based on historical fuel consumption and specified emission rates.
The allowances can be traded as commodities.
To ensure that allowances are consistently valued and to ensure that all of the projected emission reductions are in fact achieved, it is necessary that actual emissions from each affected utility unit be accurately determined
.
To fulfill this function, Title IV requires that affected units continuously measure and record their SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions, as well as volumetric flow, opacity, and diluent gas levels.
Most plants will fulfill these requirements by using continuous emission monitoring systems.
The EPA initially promulgated regulations for Acid Rain Program continuous emission monitoring (CEM) requirements at 40 CFR Part 75 on January 11, 1993 (58 FR 3590) and has published interim and direct final rule revisions to Part 75 as well as technical revisions since that time.
The most recent revisions include extensive rule revisions published on May 26, 1999 (64 FR 28564) to 40 CFR Parts 72 and 75 and May 14, 1999 revisions (64 FR 26484) to the flow test methods in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A. Initially, this manual addressed policy questions involving the implementation of the Acid Rain CEM Program.
Effective with Update #7 issued in November 1995, the name of this manual was changed to the "Acid Rain Program Policy Manual," and the manual now includes questions and answers related to Acid Rain Program policy issues other than Part 75 issues.
This manual provides a series of Questions and Answers that can be used on a nationwide basis to ensure that the Acid Rain Program is applied consistently for all sources affected by the program.
The manual includes a general table of contents that lists the major topic area and a separate table of contents for each topic area that identifies the appropriate page reference for each Question and Answer applicable to that area.
At the end of this manual, a key word index is provided that identifies for each key word the question number(s) where an issue concerning that key word is addressed.
This manual is intended to be a living document.
The EPA will issue new Questions and Answers as they arise and will revise previously issued Questions and Answers as necessary to provide clarification.
It should be noted that the materials in this manual are guidance materials only and are intended to clarify the regulations.
This document is not intended, nor can it be relied upon, to create any rights enforceable by any party in litigation with the United States.
EPA may decide to follow the guidance provided in this document, or to act at variance with this guidance, based on its analysis of the specific facts presented.
This guidance Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page iii Introduction may be revised without public notice to reflect changes in EPA's approach to implementation, or to clarify and update text.
The contents of this manual are available to the general public through the Internet on the Acid Rain Homepage.
The electronic version is provided in an Adobe Acrobat file (pdf format).
Updates to the manual will be issued as separate Adobe Acrobat files.
Periodically, EPA will reissue a complete manual that incorporates the updates.
This version of the manual includes the original March 11, 1993 version, and Updates #1 through #12 to that original version.
Table A, below, provides a list of the questions in this update and their status (new or revised).
Two new sections, 22 and 24, are also included.
Section 22 deals with Subtractive Configurations and Section 24 covers NOx Apportionment.
Finally, the contact list (Appendix A) has been updated and the "Quarterly Report Review Process for Determining Final Annual Data" (part of Appendix C) has been revised (the other documents from Appendix C have not been revised).
If after reviewing the regulations and this manual, the reader still has an unresolved issue, the reader should contact the appropriate EPA Headquarters or Regional Office contact.
An Acid Rain CEM Program contact list appears in Appendix A of this manual.
In response to the recent rule revisions, and given that certain questions and answers that were timesensitive are no longer applicable, this version of the manual "retires" a number of questions and answers.
In addition, for ease of reference, EPA has retained the same numbering for all questions and answers from previous versions of the manual.
The "History" information in each answer indicates when the question and answer was originally published and when, if applicable, it was retired or revised.
The table of contents for each section also identifies which questions and answers have been retired or revised.

Yes.
The minimum data capture requirements of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.10(d)(1) therefore apply to each system separately (i.e., a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) must be completed in each successive 15-minute interval, for each monitoring system).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.10(d) Time-sharing First published in May 1993, Update #1; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Answer: References: Key Words: History: Question 1.3 Topic: Question: Acceptable Monitors Are all types of monitors, including in-situ monitors, appropriate for use in the Part 75 program? Yes, all types of CEMS are appropriate for use in the CEM program as long as the CEMS is able to meet the design specifications, all the initial performance test requirements, and the annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and daily QA/QC requirements of Part 75.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.10, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.66(l) Monitors, Petitions First published in November 1993, Update #2 Answer: References: Key Words: History: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 1-1 General Section 1 REVISED Use of Optical In-situ Monitoring Can I use an optical in-situ monitoring system under the Acid Rain Program? If so, how do I challenge the system with calibration gases and what procedure should I use to calculate the required gas tag values? Yes.
An optical in-situ system may be used so long as it is approved by the Acid Rain Program via issuance of a monitoring system certification.
This means the system must undergo all required tests and pass.
To test the instrument linearity and calibration error, EPA Protocol gases must be used.
The use of a calibration cell that is placed in the measurement path is acceptable.
The calibration cell must be located so as to challenge the entire measurement system.
This is analogous to the injection of calibration gas to the probe tip of extractive systems.
For path measurement systems where the calibration gas materials are introduced into a cell of different optical path length than the measurement optical path length, use the following equation to calculate the calibration gas tag values needed for daily calibration error tests or linearity checks: EAV ' SAV ( MPL CCPL Question 1.4 Topic: Question: Answer: Where: EAV SAV MPL CCPL = = = = Equivalent Audit Value Specified Audit Value Measurement Path Length Calibration Cell Path Length The EAV is the actual tag value of the EPA protocol gas to be injected.
The SAV is the required reference gas concentration specified in Section 5.2 of Appendix B of the rule as a percentage of the calculated span value.
The design should be such that the audit calibration gas is maintained at the same temperature and pressure as the stack gas to be measured.
Alternatively, the owner or operator could determine the calibration cell temperature and apply appropriate corrections to the audit measurements to represent monitor performance at actual effluent conditions, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
Any such petitions must be approved by the Administrator prior to implementation of acceptable testing.

Will EPA produce a single consolidated rule incorporating all the changes? Yes.
The Office of the Federal Register and the Government Printing Office are responsible for publishing updated regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
The Office of the Federal Register produces a consolidated version each year.
The consolidated version generally becomes available in January or February and contains all rule revisions through July 1 of the previous calendar year.
Therefore, the Office of the Federal Register version that becomes available in January or February 2000 will include the May 26, 1999 revisions to Part 75.
ARD plans to release a draft consolidated version later this year.
The Government Printing Office can be contacted at (202) 512-1800.

How will additional guidance be made available? Yes.
In addition to the October 1999 Revised Policy Manual and subsequent Policy Manual updates, EPA will provide additional guidance in two ways: (1) the EDR v2.1 instructions will be periodically updated; and (2) EPA will post answers on the Internet to questions received via e-mail.
A special location has been established on the ARD website to post questions and answers.
Go to: www.epa.gov/acidrain/so2emis.html.
Each EDR v2.1 update will be referenced by its date.
The EDR v2.1 Reporting Instructions were released on May 4, 1999.
The first update to the EDR v2.1 instructions was released on August 16, 1999.
To help sources understand the differences between the May 4 and August 16, 1999 instructions, the August 1999 instructions include a list of the changes made.
No changes are planned that will affect how the EDR is structured.
The scope of the changes will be limited to the following: (1) correction of errors; (2) inclusion of additional reporting codes, as necessary; (3) expansion or re-wording of portions of the instructions, for clarity; and (4) addition of special instructions for Subpart H sources that report data only during the ozone season.

Must all of the new rule provisions be implemented immediately? If not, can you provide guidance, including a time table, for implementing the new rule provisions? EPA has identified six categories of rule provisions in the May 26, 1999 rulemaking: (1) Category 1: Provisions that have an effective date of June 25, 1999 that are required and must be implemented beginning on June 25, 1999.
(2) Category 2: Provisions that have an effective date of June 25, 1999 that are optional and may be used on and after June 25 1999.
(3) Category 3: Provisions that will be required on a date after June 25, 1999 (April 1, 2000, in most cases).
These provisions may, at the discretion of the owner or operator, be used on and after June 25, 1999.
(4) Category 4: Provisions that have an effective date of June 25, 1999, but for which EPA is extending the required implementation date in this policy beyond June 25, 1999 to allow for equipment and DAHS upgrades.
(5) Category 5: One provision that has an effective (starting) date of January 1, 2000 and may not be used until that date.
(6) Category 6: Provisions that were deleted or replaced with a less stringent requirement from Part 75 in the May 26, 1999 final rule revisions.
Table 1, below, summarizes the major Part 72 or 75 revisions that were promulgated on May 26, 1999.
Each rule provision has been placed in one of the categories described above and guidelines are given for implementation of each provision.
The category number assigned to each rule provision appears in square brackets in the first column of Table 1 (e.g., [2] stands for Category 2).
Note that full implementation of several new rule provisions in Categories 1, 2, 3, and 4 requires a DAHS upgrade from EDR v1.3 to EDR v2.1.
However, since you are not allowed to submit quarterly report data to EPA in EDR v2.1 format until the first quarter of 2000 and are not required to submit in EDR v2.1 format until the second quarter of 2000, interim guidance is needed to implement these provisions while EDR v1.3 is still being used (i.e., in the period from June 25, 1999 to April 1, 2000 (or January 1, 2000, if the EDR v2.1 upgrade is done in the first quarter of 2000)).
Table 1 provides the Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 1-5 Answer: General Section 1 necessary interim guidelines.
Note that where Table 1 indicates that you should conduct certain reporting "after the EDR v2.1 DAHS upgrade is done" (or similar phrase), you cannot use EDR v2.1 reporting prior to reporting data for the first quarter of 2000 even if your DAHS upgrade is completed prior to that time.

There was an error in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.54(b)(5) of the previous version of Part 75.
Instead of requiring the heat input rate in mmBtu/hr, the rule had erroneously required total heat input in mmBtu.
Also, there were misstatements in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.54(c)(3).
The requirement to report SO 2 emissions in lb/hr was described as mass emissions of SO 2 rather than as an emission rate.
Both of these errors have been corrected in the May 26, 1999 final rule.
EPA encourages sources to begin performing the flow-toload ratio test before the second quarter of 2000.
Prior to upgrading your DAHS to EDR v2.1 format report flow-to-load ratio test results (pass/fail) in RT 910.

EPA is moving toward an all-electronic process for updating monitor plans.
At the present time, the Agency is able to receive electronic monitor plan updates in the quarterly report submittals, but not at other times.
EPA projects that by January 1, 2000, a mechanism will be in place for receiving electronic monitor plan updates at all times.
Until then, sources should continue to provide hardcopy monitor plan updates to the States and Regions and submit updated monitoring plan data in each quarterly report, as has been done in the past.

The Agency has done some preliminary background work, but extensive field tests are needed to determine whether PEMS should be allowed to be used under the Acid Rain Program or Subpart H. N/A Predictive emissions monitoring systems First published in March 2000, Update #12 References: Key Words: History: Question 1.16 Topic: Question: Exemptions From Part 60 Requirements My facility is subject to continuous monitoring requirements under both 40 CFR Part 60 and 40 CFR Part 75.
The May 26, 1999 revisions to Part 75 allow us to claim an exemption from linearity testing of our gas monitors for quarters in which the unit operates for fewer than 168 hours.
May I obtain a similar exemption from the Part 60, Appendix F quality assurance provisions for quarterly cylinder gas audits (which are similar to Part 75 linearity checks) for quarters in which the unit operates for fewer than 168 hours? You may only obtain an exemption from the Part 60 cylinder gas audit (CGA) requirement if the permitting authority allows it.
When a source is regulated under different programs with similar rule provisions (in this case, linearity checks and cylinder gas audits), the facility must comply with each of these rule provisions separately, unless the regulatory agency allows exceptions to this.
Therefore, unless the permitting authority in the region or state stipulates otherwise, you would have to follow the procedures of Part 60, Appendix F, which require quarterly cylinder gas audits, even for quarters in which the unit operates for fewer than 168 hours.

Can we take advantage of some of the new Part 75 rule revisions that were promulgated on May 26, 1999? You may only use the new Part 75 rule provisions if : (1) Your State permits use of the revised rule; and (2) The EDR version in which you report data (i.e., v.2.0 or v.2.1) is consistent with the new Part 75 provision(s) that you intend to use.
The best way to ensure that condition (2) above is met is to fully implement the NOx mass emissions provisions of Subpart H of Part 75 (see Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.70 through 75.75).
Note that if you choose this option, you may no longer use any monitoring or reporting option allowed by the January, 1997 NOx Budget Program Guidance, if the option is not allowed under Part 75.
You must also upgrade your DAHS software from EDR v2.0 to EDR v2.1.
If you want to implement some, but not all, of the new Part 75 provisions and wish to continue reporting in EDR v2.0, you must petition your State for permission to do so.
EPA advises States to use discretion in granting such petitions.
As a general guideline, petitions are considered approvable if the rule provisions that the source is requesting permission to use are consistent with EDR v2.0 reporting.
However, if implementation of the new rule provisions requires any of the new record types or new data fields associated with EDR v2.1, the State should carefully assess the potential impact of not receiving the extra information that EDR v2.1 would provide.
If the State considers the impact of not receiving that information to be minimal, or if the State and the facility can agree upon an alternative way of documenting compliance with the new rule provisions (e.g., use of EDR RT 910, the electronic cover letter), then the petition may be approved.
Note that regardless of whether the State approves any such petitions, NOx Budget sources must report all required data in a single EDR version.
You may not report in a Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 1-21 General Section 1 format consisting of EDR v2.0 with a few v2.1 records added on, nor may you report in EDR v2.1 with a few v2.0 records added on.
The Clean Air Markets Division will issue written guidance to the States to assist them in evaluating the types of petitions described in the previous paragraphs.
Until that guidance is finalized, States receiving such petitions should make case-by-case determinations and should contact EPA if any questions or issues arise.

If you are using a CEMS as your monitoring approach for SO2, you may continue to use an SO2 CEMS or you may use another method for determining SO2 emissions for periods when you are only burning natural gas.
The three methods that Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.11(e) allows are: (1) Under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.11(e)(2), you may certify a gas fuel flow meter and use the procedures in Appendix D to perform fuel sampling and analysis (see Section 2.3 of Appendix D).
This option is available for either pipeline natural gas or other gaseous fuels.
(2) Under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.11(e)(1), you may determine heat input rate using a CO2 or O2 monitor and a flow monitor, then use a default SO2 emission rate from Section 2.3.1.1 or Section 2.3.2.1.1 of Appendix D to convert to SO2 emissions (see Section 7 of Appendix F).
(Note that under this option, heat input rate may not be determined by gas sampling and analysis according to Section 5.5 of Appendix F.) Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 2-1 SO2 Monitoring Section 2 This option is available only for fuels that qualify as either pipeline natural gas or natural gas (as defined in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2).
To report heat input data using a CO2 or O2 monitor and a flow monitor, it is not necessary to define and certify a separate system to calculate heat input.
The flow system and CO2 system must be certified under Part 75 before using the flow or CO2 data.
To report SO2 data for pipeline natural gas or natural gas for these hours, report the SO2 mass emissions in RT 310.
Leave blank the value for unadjusted SO2 mass emissions.
The formula you should use to determine SO2 emissions is Equation F-23 from Appendix F, Section 7: Eh ' ER Ã¯Â¿Â½ HI Where: Eh = ER = HI = Hourly SO2 mass emission rate, lb/hr.
Default SO2 emission rate, either 0.0006 for pipeline natural gas or calculated using Equation D-1h, for "natural gas."
Hourly heat input rate (using bias-adjusted flow rate), mmBtu/hr.
This formula should be included in RT 520 of your monitoring plan, and identified as "F-23" in the formula code column.
For any hour in which this formula is used to calculate SO2 mass emissions, do not report a RT 200.
However, you must provide sufficient hourly data to support the heat input rate determination (i.e., report the stack gas flow rate in RT 220 and the diluent gas concentration, either in RTs 202 and 210 (if CO2 concentration is used to calculate heat input rate) or in RT 211 (if heat input rate is calculated using O2 concentration).
(3) Under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.11(e)(3) you may use the SO2 monitor during the combustion of gaseous fuel.
However, you must report a default value of 2.0 ppm SO2 whenever very low sulfur gaseous fuel (as defined in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2) is combusted and the biasadjusted SO2 hourly average value recorded by the CEMS is less than 2.0 ppm.
Periods when only gaseous fuel is burned are not used to determine the monitor data availability for SO2 when using either method (1) or (2) described above.
In addition, the standard SO2 missing data procedures are used if the SO2 CEMS will be used to report data.
The standard missing data procedures are not used in periods when only gaseous fuel is being combusted when using either method (1) or (2) described above.
Rather, if you are using a fuel flow meter to determine SO2 emissions, use the missing data procedures outlined in Appendix D.
If you Page 2-2 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 2 SO2 Monitoring are determining heat input rate by using a flow monitor and a CO2 or O2 monitor, use the specific missing data procedures for those parameters.

The unit occasionally fires gaseous fuel.
According to Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.11(e)(3)(iii), the DAHS must automatically substitute a 2.0 ppm default for hours when: (a) the unit is combusting gaseous fuel that meets the definition of "very low sulfur fuel" in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2; and (b) the measured SO2 concentration reading is less than 2.0 ppm.
Does EPA require me to demonstrate that my gaseous fuel qualifies as very low sulfur fuel before I use the 2.0 ppm default value? No demonstration is required.
The definition of very low sulfur fuel in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2 includes the following: "pipeline natural gas" (as defined in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2), "natural gas" (as defined in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2), and any other gaseous fuel which has 20 grains or less of total sulfur.
If, based on a knowledge of the composition of the gaseous fuel being combusted (e.g., from contract specifications or historical fuel sampling information), you believe the fuel qualifies as very low sulfur fuel, report the 2.0 ppm default SO2 concentration for gasfired hours when the bias-adjusted SO2 concentration is less than 2.0 ppm.

A gas-fired unit or oil-fired unit subject to the Acid Rain Program does not need a flue gas volumetric flow monitor if the owner or operator reports SO2 mass emissions using the procedures specified in Appendix D or uses the low mass emissions (LME) methodology in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.19.
Gas-fired and oil-fired units subject to Subpart H also have options for monitoring NOx mass that do not require flow CEMS.
These are outlined in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.71.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.11(d)(2), Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.19, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.71; Appendix D Excepted methods, Flow monitoring First published in Original March 1993 Policy Manual; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual References: Key Words: History: Question 3.3 Topic: Question: Requirements for Dual Flow (X-Pattern Flow) Monitoring Systems A number of sources have installed two sets of flow monitors in a single stack and are reporting the average flow value as the unit flow on an hourly basis.
This includes systems using x-pattern ultrasonic monitors, as well as systems using two differential pressure monitors.
How should these sources represent these monitors in the monitoring plan? How should they report flow data and calibration records? Answer: In the monitoring plan, identify each separate flow monitor as a component in the primary flow system.
If each monitor alone will be used as a redundant backup flow system, also define each redundant backup system containing a single flow monitor.
Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 3-1 Flow Monitoring Section 3 For example, a utility may install flow monitors Component 00A and Component 00B on a single stack.
The average flow value of Component 00A and 00B is identified with primary System P01.
Component 00A is also a component of redundant backup System B01, and Component 00B is a component of redundant backup System B02.
When the primary system is used to report data, report one set of calibration and interference records for each flow monitor component of the primary system.
Report the average hourly flow value in RT 220 using only the system ID. Leave the component ID blank.
EPA will recognize the blank component ID as an indication that the system contains more than one flow monitor component and will evaluate the monitoring plan data for the multiple components and the calibration and interference check data for appropriate multiple QA records.
For certification purposes and ongoing quality assurance, compare the reference method results to the DAHS read out for each single flow monitor and the primary flow system comprised of the average of its two components.
Report three sets of RATA and bias test data and results: one for system P01 (the average of components 00A and 00B), one for system B01, and one for system B02.
Conduct a 7-day calibration error test on each single flow monitor component.
You must report the 7-day calibration error test data and results once for each backup system and again for each flow monitor component of the primary system.
For example, you would report the 7-day calibration error test data and results for each flow monitor component of the primary system: 00A-P01, 00B-P01, and again for each of the two backup systems: 00A-B01, and 00B-B02.
The flow quarterly leak check results would be handled in the same manner as the 7-day calibration error test.
On any particular day for which data is reported from a backup flow system, you must report the daily calibration error and interference check using the backup component ID and system ID.
If both primary and backup flow systems are used in the same day, calibration error and interference check data and results should be reported once for each flow monitor component of the primary system (00A-P01 and 00B-P01) and again for the component of the backup system used (e.g., 00A-B01).

No.
Method 2 only requires a run to be long enough to obtain a stable reading at each traverse point.
The EPA recommends that flow run times be consistent with the run time for a gas RATA run (21 minutes).
Flow runs shorter than 21 minutes are acceptable, but runs must be at least 5 minutes long.

Yes.
Part 75, Appendix A, Section 2.2.2.2 details the interference check requirements for three types of flow monitors.
The EPA has received questions specifically asking whether ultrasonic flow monitors must perform the interference check.
For ultrasonic flow monitors, as well as thermal and differential pressure flow monitors, you must perform the daily interference check.
For example, for an ultrasonic flow monitoring system you would record a daily (or more frequent) interference check pass in RT 231 based on a sensor that indicates that the transducer purge air is working correctly.
Conversely, a fail would be recorded in the event that the transducer purge air is not working correctly.
Appendix A, Section 2.2.2.2 Flow monitoring, QA/QC, Reporting First published in July 1995, Update #6 Answer: References: Key Words: History: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 3-3 Flow Monitoring Section 3 REVISED Accuracy of Flow Monitoring and Reference Methods Are the SO2 emissions data reported under the Acid Rain Program high due to inaccuracy in the reference method for volumetric flow (EPA Test Method 2)? If it is uncertain, what is EPA doing to resolve the issue? The evidence amassed to date does not indicate a clearly consistent pattern.
Claims of overestimation are counterbalanced by evidence of little or no overestimation.
The results appear to be highly dependent on site-specific flow patterns, particularly whether the emission flow is axial, going straight out the stack, or off-axial (i.e., swirling out the stack).
In addition, many of the claims appear to be based on a comparison between flow rates derived from fuel factors and fuel sampling-based heat input and flow rates derived from continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) as required by Part 75.
Concluding that SO2 measurements are incorrect because the monitored flow rates are higher than the fuel-factor-derived flow rates is questionable.
The frequency of measurement (hourly) and quality assurance (daily) is generally much higher with the Acid Rain certified CEMS than with fuel sampling.
Estimating flow over short periods of time from fuel factors and heat input also depends on a high degree of consistency in the fuel supply, which is rarely the case at coal-fired boilers.
In response to the concerns of the regulated community and because of the importance of accurate emission measurements for environmental protection, and for the effective operation of the SO2 allowance market, EPA developed three new test methods (Reference Methods 2F, 2G, and 2H) for measuring volumetric flow.
These new test methods were published in the Federal Register and became effective on July 13, 1999.
Method 2F measures the axial velocity, taking into account both the yaw and pitch angles, using a 3-dimensional probe, such as a prism-shaped, five-hole probe (commonly called a DA or DAT probe) or a five-hole spherical probe.
Method 2G is a variant of existing Method 2, which uses a Type S pitot tube or a 3dimensional probe to determine the flue gas velocity in a stack or duct, taking into account the yaw angle of flow.
Method 2G does not account for the pitch angle of flow.
In a stack or duct with flowing gas, the gas velocity will approach zero near the stack or duct wall.
Method 2H can be used in conjunction with existing Method 2 or new Question 3.6 Topic: Question: Answer: Page 3-4 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 3 Flow Monitoring Methods 2F or 2G to account for this velocity drop-off when determining volumetric flow rate.
Questions 3.13 through 3.23 in this manual provide implementation guidelines for the new flow methods.
If additional questions arise concerning these new methods, EPA will add further questions and answers to Section 3, as appropriate.

No.
The Acid Rain regulations require relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) to be performed using the appropriate test method that is in effect at the time of RATA testing.
Prior to July 13, 1999, Method 2 was the specified reference method for flow rate RATAs.
However, on May 14, 1999, three new test methods for measuring volumetric flow rate (Methods 2F, 2G, and 2H) were published in the Federal Register and became effective on July 13, 1999.
On and after the effective date, these new test methods may be used to re-characterize flow monitors and to perform flow RATAs.
Retroactive adjustment of SO2 emission data reported prior to that date will not be allowed, however.
Implementation guidelines for the new flow methods are given in Questions 3.13 through 3.23, below.
40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A (RMs 2, 2F, 2G, and 2H) Flow monitoring, Reference methods First published in November 1995, Update #7; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Answer: References: Key Words: History: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 3-5 Flow Monitoring Section 3 REVISED Interference Checks when Unit is Operating Must interference checks be performed when the unit is operating? Yes.
Appendix A, Section 2.2.2.2 requires a utility to demonstrate non-interference from moisture, and to perform a daily test to detect pluggage and/or malfunction of each resistance temperature device (RTD), transceiver or equivalent.
Flow monitors commonly employ a purge across the transceiver or out the sampling ports or periodic heating of RTDs to meet the above requirements.
Because all of these are active measures utilizing mechanical/electrical devices, they may be susceptible to changes in temperature and pressure observed during unit operation.
Therefore, the interference check should be performed during unit operation.

Part 75, Appendix A, Section 2.2.2.2 states in part: "Design and equip each flow monitor with a means to detect, on at least a daily basis, pluggage of each sample line and sensing port. . . ."
Because differential pressure flow monitor purge cycles are generally performed at least daily, performing the interference check during the purge may make sense.
Regardless of whether the interference check is performed during a purge, the interference check must be performed so that any pluggage is detected and reported at least daily.
In practice, this means that if no pluggage of any sample line or sensing port is present, a passed interference check would be reported; if pluggage is present, a failed interference check would be reported.
Also, please refer to Question 3.5.

Can I use the wet bulb-dry bulb technique to determine the moisture content of the stack gases? It depends upon the use of the moisture data.
The wet bulb-dry bulb technique may not be used when converting dry pollutant concentration to a wet basis for the calculation of pollutant emission rate.
Either Reference Method 4 in Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60 or the approximation method described in Section 3 of Method 4 (midget impinger technique) must be used to convert gas concentrations from a dry to wet basis.
A 1978 EPA field study has demonstrated that the midget impinger technique is capable of giving results within 1% H2O of the reference method (see Reference 2 in the Bibliography of Reference Method 6A).
Method 4 allows the use of other approximation methods, such as the wet bulb-dry bulb technique to provide estimates of percent moisture to aid in setting isokinetic sampling rates prior to a pollutant emission measurement run.
For the Acid Rain Program, you may use the wet bulb-dry bulb technique when determining the molecular weight of the stack gas for the purpose of calculating the stack gas volumetric flow rate.

Not necessarily.
According to Section 2.3.2(b)(3) of Appendix B, you have two data validation options following a major adjustment or re-linearization of a flow monitor: (1) invalidate all data from the monitor from the hour of the re-linearization of the instrument until a subsequent hands-off RATA is passed; or (2) invalidate data from the monitor from the hour of the re-linearization of the instrument until a subsequent probationary calibration error test is passed and then use the conditional data validation procedures of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.20(b)(3).
When the second option is chosen, if the subsequent RATA is passed hands-off, data from the monitor are considered qualityassured, back to the time of completion of the probationary calibration error test.

In particular, what adjustments can be made to the flow monitor in preparation for performing a RATA using Methods 2F, 2G, and 2H? The recommended procedures for implementing the new flow rate methods are as follows: (1) First, decide which flow reference method or combination of methods will be implemented (e.g., Methods 2 and 2H with a default wall adjustment factor (WAF), Methods 2F and 2H with a calculated WAF, etc.).
(2) Second, perform whatever diagnostic testing and wall effects measurements are necessary to establish new parameter values or to adjust existing parameter values Answer: Page 3-8 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 3 Flow Monitoring that will be programmed into the flow monitor to make the monitor readings agree with the selected reference method(s).
(This process is analogous to the set-up or characterization of the flow monitor that was done prior to initial certification, to make the monitor readings agree with Method 2.)
If Method 2F or 2G is selected as a reference method, establish the new parameter values or parameter value adjustments at three load levels (low, mid, and high).
If Method 2H will be used to obtain calculated WAFs, characterize separate WAFs at each of the three load levels.
If Method 2H is used with a default WAF, no wall effects measurements are needed.
In that case, apply a constant parameter adjustment of either 0.5% or 1.0% (as appropriate to the type of stack) at each load level.
(3) Third, incorporate the new parameter values or parameter value adjustments, determined in the second step, above, into the flow monitor and then perform a follow-up 3-load RATA using the selected reference method(s).
For the followup RATA, use the data validation procedures in Section 2.3.2 of Appendix B (note especially paragraph (b)(3)).
(Note: The procedures described above are recommended, not required, because EPA recognizes that there may be situations in which the owner or operator desires to use the new flow rate methods for reference method testing without making any adjustments to the polynomial coefficients or K-factor(s) of the flow monitor.
For example, if a particular flow monitor installed on a brick stack was originally characterized or set up using regular Method 2, and if the monitor has a 1% bias adjustment factor (BAF) with respect to Method 2, the owner or operator may elect to perform the next RATA of the flow monitor cold (i.e., without changing any coefficients or K-factors) and to use a combination of regular Method 2 and Method 2H (using the 1% default wall effects adjustment factor allowed under Method 2H) to try to eliminate the BAF.

Page 3-9 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Flow Monitoring Answer: Section 3 A default or calculated WAF may be applied to the values obtained in the first RATA performed on or after the effective date of Test Method 2H (July 13, 1999).
The WAF is applied only to the reference method value obtained by Method 2, 2F, or 2G in this RATA, not to the values reported by the flow monitor.
However, immediately before performing this RATA, new parameter values or parameter value adjustments may be programmed into the flow monitor to make the flow monitor readings agree with the selected reference method(s).
See Question 3.13 for a more detailed discussion of these adjustments.

Yes.
These limits always apply.
The likely results of using more than 16 Method 1 traverse points are twofold: (1) a lower average velocity and (2) a WAF that is greater than or equal to 0.9800 for a partial traverse and 0.9700 for a complete traverse.

May I use the WAF from last year's annual flow RATA? Perform Method 2H and recalculate the WAF every time a flow monitor relative accuracy test audit is performed.
You may not use a calculated WAF from a previous flow RATA. 40 CFR Part 60 (RM 2H, Section 12.7.2); 40 CFR Part 75, Appendix B, Section 2.3.1.1 Certification, Diagnostic testing, Flow monitoring, Recertification, Relative accuracy First published in October 1999 Revised Manual Answer: References: Key Words: History: Question 3.17 Topic: Question: Test Method 2H -- Wall Effects Adjustment Factors (WAFs) and Load Levels When performing Method 2H, can I obtain a calculated wall effects adjustment factor at one load level and apply it to all load levels of a multi-load RATA? No.
A calculated wall effects adjustment factor can only be applied at the load level at which it was obtained.
At other load levels you must either take measurements to derive a separate calculated WAF for that load level or use the default WAF applicable for your particular stack or duct. 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A (RM 2H, Section 12.7.2) Certification, Flow monitoring, Recertification, Relative accuracy First published in October 1999 Revised Manual Answer: References: Key Words: History: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 3-11 Flow Monitoring Section 3 Question 3.18 Topic: Question: Answer: Test Method 2H -- Discarding Wall Effects Adjustment Factors (WAFs) If I perform Method 2H and obtain a calculated WAF, must I use it? Even after performing Method 2H, you are free to decide not to make use of the resulting calculated WAF.
However, unless you can document technical reasons for invalidating a specific calculated WAF, you cannot discard one calculated WAF and use another calculated WAF in its place.
If any calculated WAF is applied, it must be derived from all the calculated WAFs that were obtained using Method 2H.
For example, suppose a 9-run RATA is performed using Method 2G, and Method 2H is used to obtain calculated WAFs on Runs 1, 3, and 6.
You are free to decide not to apply any calculated WAF to the Method 2G flow values.
However, if a calculated WAF is applied to these flow values, it must be the arithmetic average of all three calculated WAFs obtained using Method 2H.

Yes.
Section 12.7.2 of Test Method 2H requires that a WAF that is applied to runs in a RATA must be obtained from wall effects measurements performed during one or more runs in that RATA.
It should be noted that to be considered part of the same RATA, the runs in which the WAF measurements were made must have been completed within the RATA time period requirements in Part 75, Appendix A, Section 6.5(e).
Similarly, for single run tests, Section 12.7.1 of Test Method 2H requires that any wall effects measurements must be obtained during the same traverse in which the unadjusted velocity for the WAF calculation was obtained.

It is generally preferable to use the same flow test method at each load of a multi-load RATA.
However, different flow test methods may be used at different load levels (e.g., Method 2F at high load and Method 2 at low and mid load) if there are valid technical reasons for doing so.
Such evidence should be included in the field test report and kept on-site.
Valid technical reasons for using different flow methods include evidence that the angle of flow includes significant components of yaw and/or pitch at one load level (dictating use of Methods 2F or 2G) but not at another load level (allowing use of Method 2).
Reducing the time required to complete a RATA at a particular load level is not in itself an adequate technical justification for using different test methods at different load levels.
It should also be noted that the same flow test method must be used for each run within a load level of a RATA.
In the example presented above, all runs at the high load level would have to be performed using Method 2F and all runs at the low and mid load levels would have to be performed using Method 2.

No.
The dimensions shown in these sections only apply to a Method 1 traverse consisting of 16 points.
Section 8.2.3(b) says that for stacks or ducts with diameters greater than 15.6 feet, the interior edge of the Method 1 equal area is farther from the wall than 12 inches (i.e., db is greater than 12 inches).
Section 8.2.3(c) says that for a complete wall effects traverse the distance between drem and dlast will be less than or equal to Ã¯Â¿Â½ inch for stacks or ducts with diameters less than 16.5 feet.
These conditions apply to Method 1 traverses consisting of 16 traverse points.
Other dimensions would apply to Method 1 traverses consisting of more than 16 traverse points.

You may use the appropriate default WAF but you must report both the calculated and default WAF.
In EDR v2.1 you should report the calculated WAF in RT 614/109 (Calculate wall effects adjustment factor (WAF) derived from this test run) and the default WAF in RT 614/121 (Default WAF applied to all runs of this RATA).
Note: The deadline for upgrading to EDR v2.1 is April 1, 2000 but you may use EDR v2.1 as of January 1, 2000.
If you choose to report in EDR v2.1 as of January 1, 2000, you must use these record types.
For flow RATAs done prior to the DAHS upgrade, only the applicable recordkeeping requirements under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.59(a)(7)(ii) or Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.59(a)(7)(iii) must be met and electronic reporting of this information is not required.

A comparison of hourly flow-to-load assumes that they are related, but that is not always true.
During the rulemaking process, EPA had extensive discussions with utility representatives concerning the flow-to-load ratio test and incorporated many of their suggestions into the May 26, 1999 final rule.
One concern raised by the utilities was whether a straight flow-to-load ratio is a sufficiently reliable indicator of flow monitor performance.
To address this concern, the final rule allows an alternative to the straight flow-to-load comparison.
The quarterly flow rate data may instead be analyzed using the gross heat rate (GHR), which includes a correction for the diluent gas concentration.
In many instances, using the GHR appears to be a more satisfactory way of evaluating the data, especially for common stacks.
Also note that the tolerance band for the flow-to-load ratio or GHR test is rather wide.
For a further discussion of the rationale behind the flow-to-load ratio test, see the preamble to the May 21, 1998 proposed revisions to Part 75 (63 FR 28061).

What kind of hourly averages are these? Is the answer the same for a peaking unit (using 3 to 12 hours)? These hourly average flow rates are the ones required under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.10(d)(1), and are calculated in the same way for peaking and non-peaking units.

The default WAF may only be applied to the average velocity unadjusted for wall effects obtained from a Method 1 traverse consisting of 12 or 16 traverse points.
A default WAF may not be applied to the average velocity obtained from a Method 1 traverse consisting of more than 16 traverse points.
The default WAF values specified in Method 2H (i.e., 0.9900 for brick and mortar stacks and 0.9950 for all other types of stacks) were derived based on field data from 16-point Method 1 traverses.
Consistent with the provisions of section 12.7.2, these default WAFs may be applied to the average velocity unadjusted for wall effects "obtained from runs in which the number of Method 1 traverse points sampled does not exceed the number of traverse points in the runs used to derive the wall effects adjustment factor."
That is, the default WAF may be used with Method 1 traverses consisting of 12 or 16 points, but not with Method 1 traverses consisting of more than 16 points.
Without this restriction, velocity decay would be double-counted in traverses consisting of more than 16 points (once in the additional Method 1 traverse points close to the wall and then again when the default wall effects adjustment factor is applied to the results of the Method 1 traverse).

Page 3-18 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 3 Answer: Flow Monitoring In low pitch angle applications, a spherical probe may be easier to read than a DA or DAT probe.
This is likely to be less of a consideration, however, if an electronic manometer is used to read the pitch angle pressure, as recommended in Section 6.4 of Method 2F.

When using a 3-D probe (i.e., DA, DAT, or spherical) either under Method 2F or in yaw-determination mode under Method 2G, you may use the probe at any average velocity greater than or equal to 20 fps if it has been calibrated at 60 and 90 fps.
That is, a 3-D probe may not be used under Method 2F or 2G if the average velocity is less than 20 fps.
Under Method 2G, if you calibrate a Type S probe at 60 and 90 fps, you may use the probe at any average velocity greater than or equal to 30 fps.
A Type S probe under Method 2G may be used at average velocities less than 30 fps, but only if one of the two velocity settings used when calibrating the probe is less than or equal to the average velocity encountered in the field.
This must be verified in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 12.4 of Method 2G.
Also, the QA/QC requirements in Sections 10.6.12 through 10.6.14 of Method 2G for calibration coefficients must be met at the chosen calibration velocity settings.

Page 3-20 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 3 Answer: Flow Monitoring You must perform a Method 1 velocity traverse of a least 16 points for each run used in the calculation of the WAF. 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, Method 2H Flow monitoring, RATA, Wall effects adjustment factor First published in March 2000, Update #12 References: Key Words: History: Question 3.34 Topic: Question: Minimum WAF Under the new flow methods, what if a source finds that it is getting a calculated wall effects adjustment factor (WAF) less than 0.9700 (i.e., more than a 3% reduction in the velocity calculated without Method 2H)? Can you do more than sixteen Method 1 traverse points and use a WAF value of less than 0.9700? You may use more than sixteen Method 1 traverse points when a Method 2H calculated WAF is used.
However, no matter how many Method 1 traverse points are used, you may not apply a calculated WAF that is less than 0.9700 for a complete wall effects traverse or 0.9800 for a partial wall effects traverse to the runs of a flow RATA.
It should be noted, however, that the actual calculated value of the WAF should be reported in column 109 of RT 614.
Note that the August 1999 instructions for RT 614, column 109, in this regard, were incorrect (EPA has corrected this error in the January 20, 2000 revised EDR Version 2.1 Reporting Instructions).
For example, suppose that for a particular RATA run, you calculate a WAF of 0.9600, based on a complete wall effects traverse.
You would report this measured WAF in column 109 of RT 614.
However, you could not apply the WAF of 0.9600 to the runs of the RATA, because when a complete wall effects traverse is performed, the lowest WAF that you are allowed to use is 0.9700.
Report the actual WAF applied to the RATA runs (in this case, 0.9700) in column 115 of RT 614.

By applying the WAF allowed by Method 2H, you are reducing potential systematic error that may result under Method 2 if velocity decay at the wall is not taken into account.
The error band about the mean measured stack gas velocity characterizes the random error in Method 2 and is unrelated to the systematic error addressed by the WAF. 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, Methods 2 and 2H Flow monitoring, RATA, Wall effects adjustment factor First published in March 2000, Update #12 Answer: References: Key Words: History: Page 3-22 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 SECTION 4 NOx MONITORING Page 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 4.10 4.11 4.12 4.13 4.14 4.15 RETIRED REVISED NOx Emission Rate System Availability .....................

Section 75.33(c) states that valid NOx emission rates (i.e., lb/mmBtu) must be obtained for each hour; if they are not, the missing data procedures apply.
A valid hourly NOx emission rate in lb/mmBtu depends upon two valid monitor readings (i.e., pollutant and diluent readings).
If either hourly reading is invalid, then the emission rate for that hour is also invalid.
Therefore, for NOx, the data availability is calculated based only upon those hours during which both the pollutant and diluent monitors provide valid readings, and the pool of historical lb/mmBtu readings used to fill in missing data must likewise consist of only those hours for which both monitors provide valid readings.
Note that Section 2.2.3 of Appendix B clearly states, regarding the daily calibration error checks, that a NOx-diluent monitoring system "is considered out-of-control if either of the component monitors exceeds the applicable specification in Section 3.2, appendix A to this part."
In summary, the NOx monitoring system is considered unavailable during any clock hour in which either the pollutant or diluent monitor (or both) is unavailable.

Does the data need to go only to the State agency? In accordance with the provisions of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.65, opacity data are to be reported to the applicable State agency.
It is not necessary to include opacity data in the quarterly electronic reports submitted to the Administrator.
The reporting requirements in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.64(a)(2) specify that opacity data required in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.54(f), Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.57(f), or Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.59(a)(8) (as applicable) be included in quarterly reports.
The opacity recordkeeping requirements in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.54(f) or Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.57(f) (as applicable) specify that opacity data are to be recorded on a six minute basis, rather than an hourly basis, because State requirements commonly specify six-minute averaging times.
Since opacity data are to be reported to the State, opacity data should not be included in the quarterly reports sent to EPA.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.54(f), Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.57(f), Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.59(a)(8), Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.65 Opacity monitoring, Reporting First published in Original March 1993 Policy Manual; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Question 5.1 Topic: Question: Answer: References: Key Words: History: Question 5.2 Topic: Question: REVISED Opacity Requirements If monitoring and reporting for opacity are in compliance with State requirements, will this be considered as satisfying the requirements in Part 75? Yes, in general.
Compliance with State opacity monitoring and reporting requirements would satisfy the requirements of Part 75 since Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.65 specifies that opacity reporting be performed in a manner specified by an applicable State or local pollution control agency.
In addition to complying with the reporting requirements in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.65, however, owners or operators are also subject to specific opacity monitoring requirements (Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.14) that require opacity monitoring systems to meet design, installation, equipment, and performance specifications in Performance Specification (PS) 1 in Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 60.
Therefore, in States where opacity monitoring systems are not subject to the requirements in PS 1, owners and operators must still Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 5-1 Opacity Monitoring Section 5 ensure that opacity monitoring systems meet the PS 1 requirements, even though these monitoring requirements may be beyond those in the applicable State or local regulations.
An owner or operator should continue reporting opacity information according to the requirements contained in the State implementation plan.
Opacity information can be submitted according to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of Part 75; however, where a conflict occurs between existing requirements and Part 75, follow the existing requirements of the State implementation plan.

No.
If a utility is subject to existing State or local requirements, opacity records may be stored in that format.
Section 75.54(f) or Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.57(f) (as applicable) provides a default record format which must be used only in cases where there are no recordkeeping and reporting formats specified by the applicable State or local agency.

Yes.
An exemption from opacity monitoring under the provisions of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.14(b) is applicable only to opacity monitoring requirements in the Acid Rain Rule and does not supersede monitoring requirements in other rules.
Therefore, if opacity monitoring is required under other regulatory programs (e.g., New Source Performance Standards or State Implementation Plans), a waiver of opacity monitoring under the Acid Rain Rule would not constitute a waiver of the requirements in other applicable rules.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.14(b) Control devices, Opacity monitoring First published in November 1993, Update #2; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Answer: References: Key Words: History: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 5-3 Opacity Monitoring Section 5 REVISED Opacity Monitoring -- Exemption For a unit with a wet flue gas pollution control system, Ã¯Â¿Â½75.14(b) allows an exemption from the requirement to install, certify, operate and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS), if the owner or operator can "demonstrate that condensed water is present in the exhaust flue gas stream and would impede the accuracy of opacity measurements."
What is expected for such a demonstration? The designated representative should submit a petition for an exemption to the Director of the Clean Air Markets Division (formerly the Acid Rain Division) under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.66 that includes: a written statement, certified by the designated representative, that the unit has a wet flue gas pollution control system, and the results of procedures that demonstrate that the stack gas contains liquid water droplets.
The designated representative should use the following procedure to demonstrate whether liquid water droplets are present in the gas stream.
Perform the procedures described in the Notes in Sections 1.2 and 2.3.5 of EPA Method 4 (see Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 60) to demonstrate that the effluent gas stream is saturated.
These procedures must be performed under representative conditions and at the COMS location or, if no COMS is currently installed, at the location required by Performance Specification 1 in Appendix B of 40 CFR Part 60.
The Note in Section 1.2 requires simultaneous determination of moisture content using two procedures, (1) the reference method (with impingers) and (2) using either a psychrometric chart or saturation vapor pressure tables with measured stack gas temperature.
The Note in Section 2.3.5 requires two calculations of stack gas moisture content (one calculation using each of these two procedures).
If the moisture content from procedure (2) above is significantly less than the moisture content from procedure (1) above, then the stack gas is saturated and is assumed to have condensed water present.
The Director of the Clean Air Markets Division will determine whether the petition meets these requirements, and whether to exempt the unit under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.14(b) from Part 75 opacity monitoring requirements.
EPA notes that installation of a COMS may be required both by the Acid Rain Program and by another Federal or State program.
If you want approval of an alternative opacity monitoring approach under another program, then you must also meet the relevant requirements for that other program.
For example, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 60.13(i)(1) in the General Provisions of the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) regulations (40 CFR Part 60) requires submittal of an application to the Administrator, requesting permission to use an alternative monitoring approach in cases where: "... a continuous monitoring system or monitoring device specified by this part would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other interferences caused by Question 5.6 Topic: Question: Answer: Page 5-4 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 5 Opacity Monitoring substances with the effluent gases."
Therefore, in order to use an alternative opacity monitoring approach for a unit subject to NSPS, the owner or operator must submit an application (separate from the Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.66 petition) to the Administrator for approval.
(Note that in some cases, "the Administrator" refers to the EPA Regional Office and in other cases, where NSPS enforcement authority has been delegated, it refers to the State or local agency).
The Regional, State, or local office must decide, on a case-bycase basis, whether the information submitted with the application adequately demonstrates that an alternative monitoring approach is justified.
To ensure national consistency in such demonstrations, the Regional, State, and local offices should consult with EPA Headquarters.

7-18 Page 7-ii Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 7 Backup and Portable Monitoring REVISED Portable Gas Analyzers Can a portable rack of gas analyzers be used as backup monitoring systems for multiple locations? Describe what constraints or limitations may apply.
There are two ways that a portable rack of gas analyzers may be used as backup monitors for multiple locations: (1) The portable analyzers may be operated as reference method backup monitoring systems (i.e., operated according to EPA Method 3A, 6C, or 7E).
Detailed guidance on the use of reference method backup monitors is given in Section 21 of this Policy Manual; or (2) The analyzers may be used either as regular non-redundant backup monitoring systems or as like-kind replacement analyzers (see Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.20(d)).
A regular nonredundant backup monitoring system uses a different probe and sample interface from the primary monitoring system.
Regular non-redundant backup monitoring systems must be certified at each location where they will be used.
All certification tests in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.20(c), except for the 7-day calibration error test, are required.
If the portable analyzers are the same make and model as the primary gas analyzers, the portable analyzers may be used as like-kind replacement analyzers by connecting them to the same probe and interface as the primary gas monitors.
Initial certification of a like-kind replacement analyzer is not required.
For both regular non-redundant backup monitoring systems and like-kind replacement analyzers, a linearity test is required each time that the backup monitor is brought into service.
Regular non-redundant backup monitoring systems must be identified in the monitoring plan required under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.53 as separate monitoring systems with unique system ID numbers.
In each quarter that a like-kind replacement analyzer is used for data reporting, it must be represented in the electronic monitoring plan as a component of the primary monitoring system, and must be assigned a component ID that begins with the letters "LK" (e.g., "LK3").
Data from the like-kind replacement analyzer are reported under the primary monitoring system ID number, and an hourly method of determination code (MODC) of "17" must be reported in the EDR whenever a like-kind replacement analyzer is used.
Part 75 allows manual entry of both the component ID and the MODC for like-kind replacement analyzers.
Question 7.1 Topic: Question: Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 7-1 Backup and Portable Monitoring Section 7 The use of a regular non-redundant backup monitoring system or like-kind replacement analyzers is limited to 720 hours per year per parameter (i.e., # 720 hours each for SO2, NOx, CO2, or O2) at each unit or stack location.
To use a regular non-redundant backup monitoring system more than 720 hours per year at any location, a RATA is required.
To use like-kind replacement analyzers more than 720 hours per year at a unit or stack location requires redesignation of the analyzers as regular non-redundant backup systems, which then must be certified at that location.
References: Key Words: History: Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.20(d) Backup monitoring, Monitor location, Reference methods First published in Original March 1993 Policy Manual; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Question 7.2 Topic: Question: REVISED Non-redundant Backup Monitoring Systems Can an analyzer be certified and then be taken out of service and stored for use as a backup in case of failure of a primary analyzer? Yes.
Since the backup monitor was certified at the stack or unit location, and since the only description of the backup monitor is that it is an analyzer, the monitor should, in the absence of additional information, be designated as a regular non-redundant backup system.
The backup monitoring system may be used for up to 720 hours per year at the location where it was certified.
Note: If the spare analyzer in this question were found to be the same make and model as the primary analyzer and if, when brought into service, it used the same sample interface as the primary monitor, the spare analyzer could be redesignated as a like-kind replacement analyzer (see Question 7.1).

The criteria that Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.10(d)(1) specifies for primary monitoring data also apply to reference method backup monitoring data; during periods other than calibration, maintenance, or quality assurance activities, an hourly average is not valid unless it is calculated from data collected in each of the four successive 15-minute periods in the hour.
During calibration, maintenance, or quality assurance, hourly averages are considered valid if they are calculated from data collected in at least two of the four successive 15-minute periods in the hour (see also Question 21.19).

Additionally, clarify the limitations on spare parts change-out in maintaining certification.
The owner or operator has three principal options for obtaining data when a primary monitor is not operating: (1) the use of an applicable reference method backup monitor; (2) the use of a certified redundant backup monitor; or (3) the use of a nonredundant backup monitor.
For a discussion of the use of reference method backup systems, see Section 21 of this Policy Manual.
For a discussion of redundant backup monitors, see Question 7.11.
For a discussion of non-redundant backup monitors, see Question 7.1.
Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 7-3 Backup and Portable Monitoring Section 7 Determination of whether specific spare part change-outs trigger recertification testing must be made on a case-by-case basis.
In general, EPA does not consider routine maintenance activities identified in the QA/QC Plan for the monitor to be activities that require recertification.
Additional guidance regarding the types of changes to a monitoring system that necessitate recertification is provided in Section 13 of this Policy Manual.
Whenever it is unclear whether a specific change necessitates recertification testing, contact the appropriate EPA Regional Office for clarification.

Yes, if the following conditions are met.
(1) If the reference methods are used as backup monitoring systems for obtaining Acid Rain Program data, single-point monitoring is allowed in accordance with the guidelines in Question 21.16.
(2) If the reference methods are used for Part 75 RATA applications, Section 6.5.6 of Appendix A allows single-point sampling if stratification is demonstrated to be absent at the sampling location.
A 12-point stratification test is required prior to each RATA.
To qualify for single point sampling for a particular gas, Section 6.5.6.3(b) specifies that the concentration at each traverse point must deviate by no more than 5.0% from the arithmetic average concentration for all traverse points.
The results are also acceptable if the concentration differs by no more than 3 ppm or 0.3% CO2 (or O2) from the average concentration for all traverse points.
For each pollutant or diluent gas, if these criteria are met, a single sampling point, located along one of the traverse lines used during the stratification test and situated at least 1.0 meter from the stack wall, may be used for the reference method sampling.

No.
The 720 hours of allowable use of non-redundant backup monitors applies to the unit or stack location, not to any particular monitor or monitoring system (see Question 7.1).
Therefore, it is possible for a non-redundant backup monitor or monitoring system which is used at more than one unit or stack location to accumulate more than 720 hours of use per year (e.g., 500 hours at Stack #1 and 500 hours at Stack #2).

Data collected by a backup monitor during primary monitor downtime would be valid if: (1) the data are obtained using a reference method backup monitor, a certified redundant backup monitor or a non-redundant backup monitor; and (2) the backup monitor is in-control, with respect to all of its applicable quality assurance requirements.

No.
A portable back-up monitor which is certified at a particular unit or stack location is classified as a regular non-redundant backup monitoring system (see Question 7.1).
This type of monitoring system must be separately certified at each location where it is used to obtain data.

Yes.
Section 75.10(e) provides that a particular monitor may be designated both as a certified primary monitor for one unit and as a certified redundant backup monitor for another unit.
An example of this would be an SO2 analyzer which is continuously time-shared between Units 1 and 2.
If Unit 2 has its own separate primary SO2 monitoring system, the time-shared analyzer could then be designated both as the Answer: Page 7-6 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 7 Backup and Portable Monitoring primary SO2 monitoring system for Unit 1 and as a redundant backup SO2 monitoring system for Unit 2.

These systems will be on hot standby.
In other words, our backup systems will be certified and will undergo all of the same QA/QC procedures and testing that our primary systems do.
The backup monitors will operate continuously as if they were our primary monitors.
We plan to use the backup data when our primary monitor is out of service or the primary data is invalid.
This will minimize our use of the missing data procedures.
It is our understanding that because our backup system will be on hot standby it will not be necessary to run a linearity check before using the data.
Please confirm.
Answer: Your understanding is correct.
Section 75.20(d) states that before a non-redundant backup monitor is used, it must undergo a linearity check.
This requirement applies when the backup analyzer has been on the shelf and would need to be calibrated before being placed in service.
However, for a redundant backup system, which is certified, operated, calibrated and maintained in the same manner as a primary system there is no need to perform a linearity check each time the backup system is brought into service.
A redundant backup system must comply with the primary CEM quality assurance and quality control requirements in Appendix B (one of which is to perform quarterly linearity checks), with the exception that daily calibration error tests are only required to validate data when the redundant backup system is actually used to report Acid Rain Program data.
Provided that the certified redundant backup monitor is operating in-control with respect to all of its daily, quarterly, semiannual, and annual QA requirements, it may be used to generate quality-assured data whenever the primary monitor is down.
Note: A redundant backup monitoring system is designated as "RB" in the electronic data reporting format under the data element "Primary/Backup Designation" in RT 510.

In general, a linearity check must be passed each time the non-redundant backup monitor or monitoring system is brought into service.
Data from the monitor are considered invalid until the linearity test is passed, unless a probationary calibration error test is passed when the non-redundant backup monitor is brought into service, in which case, data from the system may be considered conditionally valid for a period not to exceed 168 unit or stack operating hours, until a linearity test is completed.
If the linearity test is passed within the 168 unit or stack operating hour window, then all of the conditionally valid emissions data, from the hour of the probationary calibration error test until the hour of completion of the linearity test, are considered to be qualityassured data, suitable for reporting.
However, if the linearity test is either failed, discontinued due to a problem with the monitor, or not completed within the 168 hour window, then all of the conditionally valid data are invalidated and the monitor may not be used for reporting until a linearity test is passed.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.20(d) Backup monitoring, Linearity First published in November 1994, Update #4; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual References: Key Words: History: Question 7.15 Topic: Question: REVISED Testing Requirements for Time-shared Backup Systems Two affected units discharge to a common stack.
The required SO2, NOx, and CO2 monitoring is done in the individual ducts leading to the common stack, using separate primary dilution systems for each unit.
However, the monitoring systems are configured in such a way that the Unit 2 analyzers can serve as backups for Unit 1 (and vice-versa) by time-sharing the analyzers between the two units.
What are the certification and QA requirements for the backup monitoring systems in this configuration? Page 7-10 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 7 Answer: Backup and Portable Monitoring In RT 510 of the electronic monitoring plan, it is necessary to define each system including the probe component in order to distinguish one system from another.
In the case described above, the backup monitoring systems should be classified as nonredundant backups in the monitoring plan, and not as redundant backups, since they can serve as backups.
This implies that they will operate only occasionally.
For example, the Unit 2 analyzer is not continuously time-shared between Units 1 and 2 (as was the case in Question 7.9), but time-sharing is done only when the Unit 1 analyzer is out of service.
Use the following guidelines to determine how many and what type of initial certification tests are required for each non-redundant backup monitoring system: (1) A linearity check of each non-redundant backup monitor is required, without exception.
(2) A cycle/response time test is required in the time-shared mode to ensure that at least one data point will be obtained every 15 minutes from each unit.
Report the result of this test for each system.
(3) A RATA and bias test are required for each non-redundant backup system; and a bias test of each backup system is required.
If, for each unit, the RATAs are conducted in the time-shared mode, separate RATAs and bias tests for the primary systems in the normal sampling mode are not required.
(4) A 7-day calibration error test is not required.
For on-going quality assurance (QA) activities, each time that a non-redundant backup monitoring system is brought into service for measuring emissions, it must pass a linearity check.
If a non-redundant backup system is used for one or more days, the system must pass a daily calibration error test on each day on which it is used to report data.
If its usage continues from one calendar quarter into the next, it becomes subject to the same quarterly linearity requirements as a primary monitoring system.
A RATA of each non-redundant backup system must be performed, at a minimum, once every eight calendar quarters.

Yes.
The elements of the policy are presented in question and answer format in Questions 7.17 through 7.21.
Not applicable Backup monitoring, DAHS First published in July 1995, Update #6 References: Key Words: History: Question 7.17 Topic: Question: REVISED Use of Backup DAHS Components How should Part 75 monitoring systems containing backup digitizer and/or software components be represented in the monitoring plan? All of the analytical, digitizing, and software components (primary and backup) which are to be used for data reporting must be shown in the data handling system flow diagram required by Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.53(e)(2)(iii).
Each unique data reporting pathway (i.e., each analyzer-digitizer-software combination) must be represented as a separate monitoring system in RTs 510 of the monitoring plan.
Classify each data reporting pathway as either principal or auxiliary.
A principal data pathway is one for which all of the initial certification tests and on-going quality assurance tests are required.
An auxiliary data pathway is one for which only calibration error tests and DAHS verification tests are required.
Use the following guidelines to identify the principal and auxiliary data pathways: (1) Each unique analyzer/digitizer combination must be included in at least one principal data pathway; Answer: Page 7-12 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 7 Backup and Portable Monitoring (2) The principal data pathways may all be connected to the same software component; and (3) Each data reporting pathway not identified as a principal pathway is classified as an auxiliary pathway.
The principal data pathways are represented in RTs 510 of the monitoring plan (as appropriate) as either primary (P) systems, redundant backup (RB) systems, or nonredundant backup (B) systems.
The auxiliary data pathways are represented as data backup (DB) systems in RTs 510 and must have separate system IDs.
Data backup systems have the same analytical and digitizing components as one of the primary or backup monitoring systems, but have a different software component.
Each backup software component must be assigned a unique component ID number and serial number in RT 510.
Digitizers must be shown as system components in RTs 510 only: (1) if the digitizers perform Table C calculations for Part 75 data reporting; and/or (2) when a particular analyzer is connected to two or more different digitizers through which data can be generated for reporting purposes.
Sufficient formulas must be included in RTs 520 of the plan to provide traceability for each monitoring system that is used to report data.
Example : Consider the following situation in which primary and redundant backup analyzers, digitizers and software components are shown in the data flow diagram in the monitoring plan.
The example diagram is: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 7-13 Backup and Portable Monitoring Section 7 Based on this example diagram, a total of eight data reporting pathways are identified: Reporting Pathways from Various Analyzer Digitizer - Software Combinations Pathway # Analyzer # Digitizer # Software # Pathway Designation 1 A1 D1 S1 P 2 A1 D1 S2 DB 3 A1 D2 S1 RB 4 A1 D2 S2 DB 5 A2 D2 S1 RB 6 A2 D2 S2 DB 7 A2 D1 S1 RB 8 A2 D1 S2 DB These eight data pathways represent four unique analyzer/digitizer combinations (A1/D1, A1/D2, A2/D2 and A2/D1).
Therefore, according to Guideline (1), above, a minimum of 4 principal data pathways are needed.
According to guideline (2), above, the principal pathways may all include the same software component.
Therefore, pathways 1, 3, 5, and 7 (which all include S1) are selected as principal, and 2, 4, 6, and 8 are the auxiliary pathways.
Pathway 1 is designated as the primary (P) monitoring system in RTs 510.
The other principal pathways (3, 5, and 7) are designated as redundant backup (RB) systems.
Auxiliary pathways 2, 4, 6, and 8 are designated as data backup (DB) systems.
The digitizers D1 and D2 must be shown as system components in RTs 510 because analyzer A1 is connected to both of the digitizers, as is analyzer A2.

For certification or full recertification (1) Appendix A Certification Tests: A complete battery of Appendix A certification tests must be done for each principal data pathway (i.e., for each system identified as primary, redundant backup, or non-redundant backup in RTs 510 of the monitoring plan).
The results of the required Appendix A tests and a certification or recertification application must be submitted in accordance with Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.63 For each auxiliary data pathway (i.e., for each system identified as data backup (DB) in RTs 510 of the monitoring plan), a daily calibration error test is the only field test requirement.
These results must be submitted both in hard-copy (DAHS printouts) and electronically.
For the electronic submittal, use RTs 600.
Submit two RTs 600 (zero and high) for the daily calibration error test of each data backup system.
(2) DAHS Verification: The following demonstrations are required for each primary and backup software component: (1) verification of monitoring plan formulas; (2) missing data routine check; and (3) verification statement, signed by the DR, that the data are in proper EDR format.
For QA/QC (1) Daily QA/QC: The ordinary requirements of Part 75 apply to all data pathways.
That is, for each monitoring system in RTs 510 that is used for data reporting on a given day (whether the system is classified as primary, redundant backup, nonredundant backup, or data backup), there must be an associated successful daily calibration, consistent with Sections 2.1.3 through 2.1.6 of Appendix B to validate the hourly data from the system for that day.
(2) Periodic QA/QC: All required quarterly, semiannual, and annual QA/QC tests (i.e., linearity checks, RATAs, etc.), must be done as specified in Appendices A and B to Part 75 for each monitoring system that corresponds to a principal data reporting pathway (i.e., for primary, redundant backup, and non-redundant Question 7.18 Topic: Question: Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 7-15 Backup and Portable Monitoring Section 7 backup systems).
No quarterly, semiannual, or annual QA tests or any additional reporting is required for the auxiliary data pathways (i.e., the data backup systems).

Each data backup (DB) system identified in the monitoring plan differs from one of the principal systems in the plan (i.e., from either a primary, redundant backup or nonredundant backup system), only in that it has a different software component.
Therefore, for each data backup system, use the BAF associated with the principal Answer: Page 7-16 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 7 Backup and Portable Monitoring monitoring system that has the same analyzer and digitizer components as the DB system.

A like-kind replacement analyzer is one that uses the same method of sample collection (dilution-extractive, dry extractive, or in-situ) and analysis (for example, pulsed fluorescence, UV fluorescence, chemiluminescence) as the analyzer that it replaced.
The like-kind replacement analyzer must also use the same probe and interface as the primary system and have the same span value.

8-22 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 8 Relative Accuracy REVISED SO2 and Flow Testing An SO2 monitor by itself requires 10% relative accuracy and a flow monitor by itself requires 15%.
However, SO2 in tons (flow + SO2) requires an accuracy of 10%.
Doesn't this really require a flow monitor to achieve at least a 10% relative accuracy? Please explain.
Although the original 1991 proposed Part 75 rule contained a relative accuracy requirement for SO2 mass emission rate (lb/hr), this requirement was not included in the final version of the rule published in the Federal Register on January 11, 1993.
The requirement was not included in the final rule because EPA was concerned that there were insufficient data to propose a mass emission relative accuracy requirement at the time the rule was signed.
However, the preamble to the January 11, 1993 rule stated that EPA might promulgate such a standard in the future.
In order to gather data for a possible future SO2 mass emission rate relative accuracy standard, EPA required the annual SO2 and flow rate RATA tests to be done concurrently.
On May 21, 1998, EPA proposed revisions to Part 75.
The preamble to the proposed revisions stated that based on an analysis of the available concurrent SO2 and flow rate RATA information, EPA was proposing: (1) to remove the requirement for annual concurrent RATA testing of SO2 and flow rate; and (2) not to promulgate a combined relative accuracy standard for SO2 mass emission rate (lb/hr).
Commenters were supportive of these proposals and they were incorporated into the May 26, 1999 final rule.
The Part 75 relative accuracy (RA) standards for SO2 and flow rate therefore remain on an individual component monitor basis.
For SO2 monitors, the required RA remains at 10.0%.
Note, however, that beginning on January 1, 2000, the flow monitor RA specification will change from 15.0% to 10.0%.
Question 8.1 Topic: Question: Answer: References: Key Words: History: Appendix A, Section 3.3 Flow monitoring, Relative accuracy, SO2 monitoring First published in Original March 1993 Policy Manual; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-1 Relative Accuracy Section 8 REVISED Quality Assurance RATAs Following successful certification, when is the first RATA required? According to Section 2.3 of Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 75, the requirement to conduct semiannual or annual relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) is effective as of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the monitor is provisionally certified (the date when certification testing is completed).
Therefore, depending upon whether or not the relative accuracy measured during the initial monitor certification qualifies the monitor for an annual RATA frequency, the projected deadline for the next RATA would either be the second or fourth calendar quarter following the quarter during which the monitor is provisionally certified.
However, as explained in the following paragraphs, the projected RATA deadline may not be the actual deadline, depending on how much a unit operates and what type of fuel is combusted.
The May 26, 1999 revisions to Part 75 changed the method of determining RATA deadlines from a calendar quarter basis to a QA operating quarter basis.
A QA operating quarter is a calendar quarter in which there are $ 168 unit or stack operating hours.
Partial operating hours are counted as full hours in determining whether a quarter is a QA operating quarter (see definitions of unit operating hour and stack operating hour in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2).
If a CEMS obtains a semiannual RATA frequency, the next RATA is due by the end of the second QA operating quarter following the quarter in which the RATA is completed.
Similarly, an annual RATA frequency means that the next RATA is due by the end of the fourth QA operating quarter following the quarter in which the RATA is completed.
For units that consistently operate more than 168 hours in each quarter, there will be little or no difference between the calendar quarter and QA operating quarter methods of determining RATA deadlines.
However, for units that operate infrequently, a one quarter extension of the projected RATA test deadline may be claimed (using RT 697) for each calendar quarter that does not qualify as a QA operating quarter.
Also, for units that burn only very low sulfur fuel (as defined in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2) during a particular calendar quarter, a one quarter extension of the SO2 monitor RATA deadline may be claimed.
Note that there is an upper limit on all such RATA deadline extensions.
The deadline may not be extended beyond the end of the eighth calendar quarter following the quarter in which a RATA was last performed.
If unforseen circumstances prevent a RATA from being completed by the deadline, the grace period provision in Section 2.3.3 of Appendix B may be used.

The original Part 75 rule required SO2 and flow rate testing to be conducted contemporaneously.
The purpose was to develop a data base for a possible combined SO2-flow rate relative accuracy standard.
However, EPA has decided against promulgating the combined SO2-flow rate standard, and, in the revised rule (May 26, 1999), all references to "contemporaneous" or "concurrent" SO2 and flow rate testing have been deleted.

No.
In accordance with Section 6.5(c) of Appendix A, simply do the RATA on the range that is considered normal.
For units with add-on SO2 or NOx controls, the low range is considered normal.
When separate monitor ranges are used for different fuel Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-3 Relative Accuracy Section 8 types (e.g., low sulfur and high sulfur fuels), both ranges are considered normal.
In such cases, perform the RATA on the range in use at the time of the scheduled test.

Yes.
Whereas the original Part 75 rule limited the owner or operator to two RATA attempts to obtain a more favorable relative accuracy percentage or bias adjustment factor (BAF), Section 2.3.1.4 in Appendix B of the revised rule (May 26, 1999) allows as many RATA attempts as are needed to obtain the desired percent RA or BAF.
The only condition is that the data validation procedures in Section 2.3.2 of Appendix B must be followed.

Answer: Either traverse point selection criteria specified in Method 1 (i.e., either 16 points or 40 (42) points) is acceptable for subsequent flow RATAs.
Part 75, Appendix A, Section 1.2 recommends the use of the flow profile procedures in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, Test Method 1, Section 2.5 (which specifies the 40 (42) point traverse) to determine the acceptability of the potential flow monitor location.
(The potential flow monitor location is acceptable if the resultant angle is # 20E and the standard deviation is # 10E.)
Following an acceptable flow profile study, the flow monitor must pass all the required performance tests for certification and QA/QC, including flow RATAs.
The selection of traverse points for subsequent flow RATAs, according Part 75, Appendix A, Section 6.5.6, need only meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, Test Method 1, and not Section 2.5.2 specifically.

If so, what should the averaging period be? Yes, an electric manometer may be used in this circumstance.
If regular Method 2 is used for the flow RATA, the electronic manometer should be calibrated according to the procedures in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, Method 2, Section 2.2.
The ? P readings from the electronic manometer should be compared to those of a gauge-oil manometer before and after the test series.
If Method 2F (3-dimensional probe) or Method 2G (2-dimensional probe) is used for the flow RATA, calibrate the electronic manometer as described in Section 10.3 of those methods.
Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-5 Relative Accuracy Section 8 A minimum averaging period of one minute at each traverse point is recommended when an electronic manometer or transducer is used.
The same averaging period should be used for each traverse point in the run.

May we continue the test without counting the three or four runs in the total runs for certification? It depends on the nature of the problem.
If the reason for discontinuing a RATA is unrelated to the performance of the CEMS being tested (e.g., problems with the reference method or with the affected unit(s)), any valid test runs that were completed prior to the occurrence of the problem may either be used as part of the official RATA or the runs may be disregarded and the RATA re-started.
However, if a RATA is Answer: Page 8-6 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 8 Relative Accuracy aborted due to a problem with the CEMS, the test is considered invalid and must be repeated.
In such cases, none of the runs in the aborted test may be used as part of the official RATA and the aborted test may not be disregarded (since it affects data validation), but must be reported in the electronic quarterly report.

No.
The bias test is designed to determine if the measured values from the CEMS are systematically low relative to the reference method.
This can only be determined by using the unadjusted values from the CEMS.
Appendix A, Section 7.6.5; Appendix B, Section 2.3 Bias, RATAs First published in November 1993, Update #2 Answer: References: Key Words: History: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-7 Relative Accuracy Section 8 REVISED Concurrent Runs for Moisture, CO2, and O2 with Flow Are separate Method 3 (CO2/O 2) and Method 4 (moisture) runs required for each Method 2 (flue gas velocity) run when performing a flow RATA? No, provided that the only reason for measuring moisture or CO2/O 2 is to determine the stack gas molecular weight.
In this case, it is sufficient to collect one sample for Method 3 and Method 4 for each three successive velocity traverses using Method 2.
Since stack gas velocity varies with the square root of one over the stack gas molecular weight (see Eq. 2-9 in Method 2), relatively large variations in O2, CO2, and moisture will have a fairly small impact on the calculation of gas velocity.
Therefore, if gas composition and moisture data are only used for calculating stack gas molecular weight, collecting Method 3 and Method 4 samples with each Method 2 run is not necessary.
For gas monitor RATAs, however, moisture results are sometimes needed to convert CEM and reference method data to the same basis.
In such instances, a one percent change in flue gas moisture content causes a one percent change in the CEM or reference method results.
Since changes in stack gas moisture content can gave a significant impact on corrected results and the outcome of performance tests, Method 4 samples must be collected with each set of reference method samples when the Method 4 results are used to correct CEM and reference method results to the same moisture basis.
Note that if two gas RATA runs are able to be completed within the same hour (60 minute period), the results of a single Method 4 run, taken during the 60 minute period, may be applied to both RATA runs.

For flow, does this mean that all three levels must be tested in 7 days? No.
In the original January 11, 1993 version of Part 75, Section 6.5 of Appendix A required each RATA to be completed within a seven day period.
A RATA is a series of nine runs or more comparing a reference method to a CEMS, the results of which are analyzed statistically.
Therefore, for an SO2, NOx, or CO2 RATA, EPA interpreted Section 6.5 to mean that there is a seven calendar day window in which to complete the nine run sequence.
For multiple-load flow RATAs, the Agency considered the relative accuracy testing at each flow rate level to have a separate seven day window.
Note that in the May 26, 1999 revisions to Part 75, the requirement to complete each RATA within seven calendar days was changed.
The new requirement, found in Section 6.5(e) of Appendix A, states that each RATA should be completed within 168 consecutive unit or stack operating hours.
For multi-load flow RATAs, up to 720 consecutive unit or stack operating hours are now allowed to complete the testing at all load levels.
Answer: References: Key Words: History: Appendix A, Section 6.5 Certification tests, Flow monitoring, RATAs First published in March 1995, Update #5; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Question 8.16 Topic: Question: REVISED Reporting Requirements for Failed RATAs How are failed or discontinued RATA results to be reported to the Agency? Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-9 Relative Accuracy Answer: Section 8 A completed, failed RATA should be reported in the same way as a completed, passed RATA.
That is, in RT 610, use a run status flag of "1" in column 62 to indicate each run that was used in the relative accuracy calculation and use a run flag of "0" to indicate which runs (maximum of three) were not used in the calculations.
Submit RT 611, summarizing the results of the relative accuracy test.
For failed RATAs, always leave column 111 (bias adjustment factor) blank.
Discontinued RATAs only have to be reported when they affect data validation.
Therefore, when a RATA attempt is aborted due to a problem with the CEMS, it must be reported because the monitoring system is considered to be out-of-control as of the hour in which the test is discontinued.
To report an aborted RATA attempt, use a run status flag of "9" for each test run.
Do not submit RT 611 for an aborted RATA.
Discontinued RATAs which do not affect data validation do not have to be reported to EPA, but a record of all such RATA attempts must be kept on-site as part of the official test log for the monitoring system(s).
Specifically, a discontinued RATA does not have to be reported if the test is discontinued due to a problem unrelated to the performance of the CEMS (e.g., due to a problem with the reference method or with the affected unit(s)).

Does this qualify for reduced RATA frequency? Yes.
Section 2.3.1.2 of Appendix B to Part 75 allows annual, rather than semiannual, RATA frequency when the RA is 7.5% or less.
The RA specification is to one decimal place.
Therefore, a RA of 7.51% qualifies for the annual RATA frequency because, by the normal rules of rounding off, 7.51, to the nearest tenth, is 7.5.
If the second decimal place in the reported RA had been 5 or greater, this would have rounded off to 7.6% and the monitoring system would not have qualified for the reduced RATA frequency.

One of those units experienced an unscheduled outage during the last quarter in which we should perform an annual relative accuracy test audit at three load levels.
Should we wait to perform the relative accuracy test audit for flow until all three units are operating again? Every effort should be made to perform the relative accuracy test audit by the end of the required quarter.
Section 6.5.2.1 of Appendix A defines the range of operation for a unit or common stack.
For common stacks, the range of operation extends from the minimum safe, stable load of any unit using the stack to the highest sustainable load with all units in operation.
Section 6.5.2.1 further defines the low, mid, and high load levels as 0 - 30%, 30 - 60% and 60 - 100% of the range of operation, respectively.
Therefore, in the present example, if a load level of at least 60% of the range of operation could be attained with two units in operation, this would suffice for the high level flow RATA.
The mid and low flow tests could then be done at 35% and 10% of the operating range, respectively (note that Section 6.5.2 of Appendix B requires a minimum separation of 25% of the operating range between adjacent load levels).
If, however, a true high level data point is not attainable with only two units in operation, then either: (1) perform the high level flow relative accuracy test based upon the maximum attainable operating level of the units operating during that quarter and document in the electronic quarterly report (in the 900-level records) that due to an unscheduled unit outage there was a deviation from the normal flow RATA procedures; or (2) if it is expected that all three units will be back in service soon after the end of the quarter, perform the high-level flow RATA within the 720 unit operating hour grace period allowed under Section 2.3.3 of Appendix B.

You may perform the RATA any time before the end of the projected RATA deadline (i.e., two or four calendar quarters following your last test).
Therefore, you may adjust your RATA schedule as necessary.

For a flow monitor, the percent relative accuracy obtained determines when the next test must be performed.
Prior to January 1, 2000, if a flow monitor passes a RATA and the relative accuracy at any load tested is 
If the relative accuracy is # 10.0 percent at all loads tested then the next flow RATA must be performed on an annual basis (i.e., within the next four QA operating quarters).
On and after January 1, 2000, if a flow monitor passes a RATA and the relative accuracy at any load tested is 
If the relative accuracy is # 7.5 percent at all loads tested then the next flow RATA must be performed on an annual basis (i.e., within the next four QA operating quarters).
Each time that a 2-load or 3-load flow RATA is completed and passed, the frequency (semiannual or annual) of the next flow RATA is established or re-established.
Note, however, that a single-load (normal load) flow RATA may not be used to establish or re-establish the RATA frequency, except when: (1) the single-load RATA is specifically required under Section 2.3.1.3(b) of Appendix B (for flow monitors installed on peaking units and bypass stacks); or (2) a single-load RATA is allowed under Section 2.3.1.3(c) of Appendix B, for a unit which has operated at a single load level (low, mid, or high) for $ 85.0% of the time since the last annual flow RATA.
Apart from these exceptions, the only way to establish or re-establish the RATA frequency for a flow monitor is to perform a 2-load or 3-load flow RATA.

If so, should the data from the normal level be used to calculate a new bias adjustment factor? Yes.
Perform a bias test for each single load flow RATA required or permitted under Part 75.
If the flow monitor passes the bias test, apply a bias adjustment factor (BAF) of 1.000 for all flow data until the next successful flow RATA.
If the monitor fails the bias test, calculate a BAF from the normal level RATA and apply this revised bias adjustment factor to each hour of flow rate data, beginning with the hour after the hour in which the RATA testing is completed.

Section 3.2 of PS 2 specifies that downstream of wet scrubbers, the RM traverse points must be located on a long measurement line, with points at 16.7%, 50% and 83.3% of the stack diameter.
Use of the alternative short RM measurement line, with points located 0.4 m, 1.0 m and 2.0 m from the stack wall is disallowed in such instances.
However, for large-diameter stacks, use of a long measurement path is difficult and presents many logistical problems.
Is it possible for the owner or operator of a scrubbed unit to conduct a test or demonstration in order to be allowed to use the short RM measurement line? Yes.
The revised Part 75 rule (May 26,1999) includes new provisions in Section 6.5.6 of Appendix A which allow the short measurement line to be used following a Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-15 Relative Accuracy Section 8 wet scrubber, provided that, just prior to each RATA, stratification is demonstrated to be minimal at the sampling location.
To demonstrate this, an initial 12-point stratification test is required at the sampling location (see Section 6.5.6.1 of Appendix A).
Reference Methods 6C, 7E, and 3A are used to measure SO2, NOx, and CO2, respectively.
Sampling is required for at least 2 minutes at each traverse point.
A stratification test is also required for each subsequent RATA at the sampling location.
However, for the subsequent RATAs, in lieu of repeating the initial 12-point test, an abbreviated 3-point or 6-point stratification test may be done (see Section 6.5.6.2 of Appendix A).
For each pollutant or diluent gas, Section 6.5.6.3(a) of Appendix A specifies that stratification is considered to be minimal if the concentration at each traverse point is within Ã¯Â¿Â½ 10.0 % of the mean concentration value for all the points.
The results are also acceptable if the concentration at each traverse point differs by no more than 5 ppm or 0.5% CO2 or O2 from the average concentration for all traverse points.
If stratification is found to be minimal, the short RM measurement line may be used for the RATA tests.
The data and calculated results from all stratification tests are to be kept on file at the facility, available for inspection, with the rest of the RATA information.

Always base Rref on the most recent normal load flow RATA, even if the RATA was performed in the quarter being evaluated.

Appendix B, Section 2.2.5 Flow-to-load test, RATA First published in October 1999 Revised Manual Answer: References: Key Words: History: Question 8.28 Topic: Question: QA Operating Quarter -- Calendar Quarter Deadline If we use the new definition of a QA operating quarter to claim exemptions from quarterly linearity checks or to extend RATA deadlines, will we have to start up units just to do testing when we reach the calendar quarter deadlines (i.e., a linearity is required at least every four calendar quarters and a RATA is required at least every eight calendar quarters)? No.
In addition to the quarterly linearity check exemptions and RATA deadline extensions that may be claimed on the basis of non-QA operating quarters, there are also grace periods for missed tests.
Grace periods allow required tests to be Answer: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-17 Relative Accuracy Section 8 completed within a certain number of unit or stack operating hours after the end of the quarter in which the QA test was due.
The two cases are as follows: For linearity checks: Appendix B to Part 75 states in Section 2.2.3(f) that "If a linearity test has not been completed by the end of the fourth calendar quarter since the last linearity test, then the linearity test must be completed within a 168 unit operating hour or stack operating hour grace period...following the end of the fourth successive elapsed calendar quarter, or data from the CEMS (or range) will become invalid."
For RATAs: Appendix B to Part 75 states in Section 2.3.1.1(a) not completed by the end of the eighth calendar quarter since the RATA, then the RATA must be completed within a 720 unit (or grace period...following the end of the eighth successive elapsed data from the CEMS will become invalid."

Section 6.5.7 in Appendix A to Part 75 specifies that the minimum RATA run time is 21 minutes for a gas monitoring system or moisture monitoring system RATA and 5 minutes for a flow RATA.
Note that the 21-minute run time for moisture system RATA appears to conflict with Sections 2.2.2 and 3.2.2 of EPA Reference Method 4 (RM4) in Appendix A of 40 CFR 60.
On one hand, Section 2.2.2 of RM4 requires collection of a minimum sample volume of 21 scf at a rate no greater than 0.075 scfm, when regular Method 4 is used, which equates to a sampling time of 28 minutes.
On the other hand, when Approximation Method 4 (midget impinger technique) is used, section 3.2.2 of RM 4 caps the sample volume at approximately 30 liters of gas, collected at a rate of 2 liters/min, which equates to a sample time of 15 minutes.
The Acid Rain Program allows either regular Method 4 or Approximation Method 4 to be used as the reference method for moisture RATA testing.
Therefore, when RM 4 is used for Acid Rain Program applications, determine the appropriate sample collection time (21 minutes, 28 minutes, or 15 minutes) as follows: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-18 Section 8 Relative Accuracy (1) When regular Method 4 is used for a Part 75 moisture monitoring system RATA, the minimum acceptable time per RATA run is 21 minutes, as stated in Section 6.5.7 of Appendix A to Part 75.
To meet this requirement, concurrent data must be collected with the CEMS and with the Method 4 sampling train for at least 21 minutes.
The Method 4 sample collection time of 21 minutes, although less than the 28 minutes specified in Section 2.2.2 of Method 4, is consistent with Section 7.1.1 of Performance Specification No. 2 (PS No. 2) in Appendix B to 40 CFR 60, which states, in reference to reference method sampling for RATA applications, "...For integrated samples (e.g., Methods 6 and 4), make a sample traverse of at least 21 minutes, sampling for 7 minutes at each traverse point...".
(2) When Approximation Method 4 is used for a Part 75 moisture monitoring system RATA, the minimum acceptable time for each RATA run is also 21 minutes.
Collect the RM and CEMS data concurrently, with the understanding that in this case only the CEMS data can be collected for the full 21 minute period, because the recommended sampling time for Approximation Method 4 (as specified in Section 3.2.2 of Method 4) is about 15 minutes.
(3) When Reference Method 4 data are used for gas monitoring system RATAs, to correct pollutant and diluent concentrations for moisture, either perform the moisture sampling concurrently with the pollutant and diluent concentration measurements as described in (1) or (2), above, or follow the guideline in Section 6.5.7 of Appendix A to Part 75, which allows non-concurrent collection of the pollutant/diluent data and auxiliary data such as moisture, provided that for each RATA run, all necessary data are obtained within a 60 minute period.
However, if the moisture data and the pollutant/diluent data are collected non-concurrently, the moisture sample collection time must be in accordance with Section 2.2.2 or 3.2.2 of Method 4, as applicable.

If I passed a flow RATA at 12% in October of 1999, is the monitor out-of-control as of January 1, 2000 when the 10% specification takes effect? No.
If you tested and met the 15% standard in place in October, 1999, then the flow monitor would not be out-of-control on January 1, 2000.
If you fail to meet the new 10% standard in a RATA completed on or after January 1, 2000 the flow monitor would be out-of-control.

You may claim either: (1) an on-going exemption from SO2 RATAs if your Designated Representative certifies that you never burn fuel with a sulfur content higher than "very low sulfur fuel" (as defined in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2); or (2) a conditional exemption from SO2 RATAs if you keep the usage of oil to 480 hours or less per year.

Appendix A, Section 6.5.2.1(b) Answer: References: Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 8-21 Relative Accuracy Key Words: History: Flow monitors First published in March 2000, Update #12 Section 8 Question 8.34 Topic: Question: Range of Operation The range of operation as defined in Section 6.5.2.1 of Appendix A to Part 75 extends from the "minimum safe, stable load" to the "maximum sustainable load."
What is meant by the "minimum safe, stable load"? The minimum safe, stable load is not precisely defined in either Part 72 or Part 75 of the Acid Rain rules.
In the absence of such a definition, use the following guidelines: the minimum safe, stable load is the lowest load at which a unit is capable of being held for an extended period of time, without creating an unsafe or unstable operating condition.
If the boiler manufacturer recommends that the unit not be operated below a certain load level, this may be used as the minimum safe, stable load.
If such a recommendation is unavailable, you may use sound engineering judgment, based on a knowledge of the historical operation of the unit, to estimate the minimum safe, stable load.
In making this determination, you may exclude low unit loads recorded during startup or shutdown while the unit is "ramping up" or "ramping down," unless these loads are able to be sustained and safely held for several hours at a time.

Does this refer to complete calendar quarters only, or can we use a calendar year of data (365 days) that begins and ends in the middle of a quarter? If we perform the analysis in the fourth Page 8-22 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 8 Relative Accuracy quarter of the year, can we simply use the data from the time we perform the analysis back to the beginning of that calendar year? Answer: The historical load analysis must include the four most recent complete operating quarters that represent typical operation of the unit.
If you perform the analysis in the middle of a quarter, you may include data from the current quarter; however, the historical look back must include load data from the previous four complete, representative operating quarters.
In some cases, a facility may need to consider more than the past four quarters of data to identify four complete operating quarters that are representative of typical operation.

Are two tests allowed to reduce the bias adjustment factor as well? Whereas the original Part 75 rule limited the owner or operator to two RATA attempts to obtain a more favorable relative accuracy percentage or bias adjustment factor (BAF), Section 2.3.1.4 in Appendix B of the revised rule (May 26, 1999) allows as many RATA attempts as are needed to obtain the desired % RA or BAF.
The only condition is that the data validation procedures in Section 2.3.2 of Appendix B must be followed.

Does this apply in the case of bias tests as well as RATAs? Are there any restrictions as to how soon retesting should commence? If a certification test results in a requirement that a bias adjustment factor be used, then the owner or operator of the affected unit may retest immediately.
EPA does not intend to place restrictions on the timing of retests performed in order to eliminate the need for the use of a bias adjustment factor.
In many cases, the failure of a bias test will be known when stack testing personnel are still on site, and requiring a pretest notification for testing performed to improve bias test results would cause needless and costly delays in the testing.

Page 10-iv Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 10 Span, Calibration, and Linearity REVISED Span If the maximum potential SO2 concentration, when multiplied by 1.25 (rounded up to the nearest 100 ppm), equals a span value of 3,100 ppm, would the source be allowed to use a full-scale range value of 3,000 ppm and if so, what value would the gas cylinder concentrations be based on? In the example cited, the full-scale range may not be set at 3,000 ppm, because Section 2.1.1.3 in Appendix A to Part 75 states that the owner or operator must "select the full-scale range of the instrument to be consistent with section 2.1 of this appendix and to be greater than or equal to the span value."
Thus, using a monitor with a full-scale range of 3,000 ppm (i.e., 100 ppm less than the calculated span value) is not acceptable.
For a span value of 3,100 ppm, the minimum acceptable full-scale range is 3,100 ppm.
Note: In the May 26, 1999 revisions to Part 75, the method of calculating the SO2 span value was modified.
Rather than requiring the maximum potential concentration (MPC) to be multiplied by 1.25, the revised rule allows a multiplier anywhere in the range from 1.00 to 1.25 to be used.
Therefore, in the present example, if a span value of 3,000 ppm could be obtained by using an allowable multiplier, the full-scale range could be set at 3,000 ppm.
The required cylinder gas concentrations for daily calibration error tests and linearity checks are always determined in the same way (i.e., as percentages of the span value), in accordance with Section 5.2 of Appendix A. Question 10.1 Topic: Question: Answer: References: Key Words: History: Appendix A, Sections 2.1.1.3 and 5.2 Calibration gases, Span First published in Original March 1993 Policy Manual; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 10-1 Span, Calibration, and Linearity Section 10 Question 10.2 Topic: Question: Answer: REVISED Zero Air What is zero air material? Zero air material is a commercially produced gas that does not contain a significant amount of the gases being measured (SO2, NOx, or CO2) or other interfering gases.
It is defined under 40 CFR Part 72 as: "(1) a calibration gas certified by the gas vendor not to contain concentrations of SO2, NOx, or total hydrocarbons above 0.1 parts per million (ppm), a concentration of CO above 1 ppm or a concentration of CO2 above 400 ppm; (2) Ambient air conditioned and purified by a CEMS for which the CEMS manufacturer or vendor certifies that the particular CEMS model produces conditioned gas that does not contain concentrations of SO2, NOx, or total hydrocarbons above 0.1 ppm, a concentration of CO above 1 ppm, or a concentration of CO2 above 400 ppm; (3) For dilution-type CEMS, conditioned and purified ambient air provided by a conditioning system concurrently supplying dilution air to the CEMS; or (4) A multicomponent mixture certified by the supplier of the mixture that the concentration of the component being zeroed is less than or equal to the applicable concentration specified in paragraph (1) of this definition, and that the mixture's other components do not interfere with the CEM readings."
Essentially, this definition establishes the maximum allowable concentrations of SO2, NOx, THC, CO, and CO2 contained in the gas used for calibration at the zero-level.
It is EPA's intention that the zero air material contain not more than the traceable concentrations for each pollutant listed in the definition.
If the CEM vendor provides a certification that the CEM system design (design must include identification of adequate quality assurance and quality control procedures) ensures that purified ambient air used for the zero-level check will meet these specifications, then, as long as the owner or operator implements the identified QA/QC procedures, purified ambient air may be used.
If the utility purchases zero air material contained in a cylinder, then the necessary certification would be provided by the calibration gas vendor.

Qualified no.
A utility is only required to use a calibration gas that provides a zerolevel concentration as specified by 40 CFR Part 75, Appendix A, Sections 5.2.1 and 6.3.1.
A zero-level concentration can be anywhere from 0.0% to 20.0% of the span value.
Therefore, a zero air material is not required unless the selected zero-level concentration is 0.0% of span.
When the selected zero-level concentration is 0.0% of span, a zero air material that meets the revised definition in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2 must be used (see Question 10.2).
Note that under the revised definition, a zero air material may be an EPA Protocol gas mixture that does not contain the component being zeroed.
For instance, a Protocol gas containing 200 ppm NO in N2 could be used to provide a zero-level concentration for an SO2 pollutant concentration monitor.

In part, Appendix A, Section 2.2.2.1 states: "Design and equip each flow monitor to allow for a daily calibration error test consisting of at least two reference values: (1) Zero to 20% of span or an equivalent reference value (e.g., pressure pulse or electronic signal) and (2) 50 to 70% of span" (emphasis added).
For differential pressure flow monitors, the above quote means that the 7-day and daily calibration error tests may be performed in units of ? P (e.g., inches of water).
For initial certification or recertification of a differential pressure-type flow monitor, the allowable calibration error (in inches of H2O) in a 7-day calibration error test is therefore 3.0% of the "calibration span value" (i.e., the ? P value that is equivalent to the velocity span value (in wet, standard ft/min) from Section 2.1.4 of Appendix A to Part 75).
The results are also acceptable if the absolute value of the difference between the flow monitor response and the reference signal value (i.e., * R - A * in Equation A-6) does not exceed 0.01 in. H2O.
The control limits for daily operation of a differential pressure-type flow monitor are Ã¯Â¿Â½ 6.0% of the calibration span value (see Section 2.1.4 of Appendix B).
The results of a daily calibration error test are also considered acceptable if the absolute value of the difference between the monitor response and the reference signal value does not exceed 0.02 inches H2O.

This coal-fired unit has no emission controls.
Sections 2.1, 2.1.2.1, and 2.1.2.2 of Appendix A to Part 75 seem to require a span of 1,000 ppm for all coalfired units for a high scale range and also a low scale closer to the actual concentration.
Do we need to install both a high-scale range of 1,000 ppm or greater and a low-scale range? No.
The original Part 75 rule did specify a maximum potential concentration (MPC) of 800 ppm and a span of 1,000 ppm for coal-fired units, and also appeared to require a second, low measurement range when concentrations were expected to be consistently less than 25% of the high range.
However, it was never EPA's intent to require two span values for uncontrolled units.
Subsequent revisions to Part 75 Appendix A have clarified that a single, high NOx span value and a single, appropriately-sized full-scale high range value are the only requirements for an uncontrolled unit.
Revised Section 2.1.2.1 of Appendix A provides the utility with four options to determine an appropriate maximum potential concentration (MPC) for NOx.
Two of the options are rather prescriptive (i.e., for the unit described, either use 800 ppm or select the MPC value of 460 ppm for T-fired units from Table 2-1); however, the other two options allow site-specific MPC determination, using either stack testing results or historical CEM data.
For the unit described in this example (an uncontrolled T-fired coal-fired unit with average NOx concentrations around 200 ppm), the sitespecific options would be more representative than the prescriptive options.
Once an appropriate MPC value has been established, the span value is determined by multiplying the MPC by a factor of 1.00 to 1.25.
The full-scale range is then set greater than or equal to the span value and (in accordance with Section 2.1 of Appendix A) is selected such that the majority of the readings during normal operation will fall between 20% and 80% of full-scale.

What hardware tests should I perform and report for instruments if the span changes and if span changes affect the range of the instrument? When you change the span associated with a unit or common stack you must submit a revised monitoring plan in electronic format to EPA Headquarters as part of the appropriate quarterly report.
Periodic evaluation of the reported emissions data is required (once a year, at a minimum), to ensure that the current span and range values are still appropriate (see Appendix A, Sections 2.1.1.5, 2.2.2.5, 2.1.3.2, and 2.1.4.3).
If a span change is necessary, it must be made within 45 days of the end of the quarter in which the need to change the span is identified, except that up to 90 days after the end of the quarter are allowed in cases where the span change requires new calibration gases to be ordered.
Submit the electronic record of each span change to EPA Headquarters in RT 530, in the report for the quarter in which the change is made.
In addition to submitting monitoring plans in the quarterly report, the agency is developing a procedure that will allow sources to submit monitoring plans electronically outside of the quarterly report.
Answer: Page 10-6 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 10 Span, Calibration, and Linearity Also report in RT 530 any range adjustment associated with the span change.
EPA requests that utilities clearly identify the effective date of the change in span in RT 530.
EPA may require resubmittal of quarterly reports and may require reported emission data to be replaced with substitute data if the span value in the monitoring plan does not agree with the span values used and reported as the basis for daily calibration and linearity checks.
Whenever making a change to the span value, perform a linearity check for gas concentration monitors (unless the span change is not great enough to require new calibration gases to be ordered) and perform a calibration error test for flow monitors.
The new span value may not be used until the required linearity check or calibration error test has been successfully completed (see the data validation procedures in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.20(b)(3)).
Some types of modifications to the monitor resulting from span and range adjustments will require full recertification of the CEMS.
For example, if the measurement cell is changed, or the reference filters are changed in an NDIR type of component, a complete set of recertification tests is required.

One hundred twenty five percent of this value (i.e., of 247 ppm) gives a span concentration of 309 ppm. Appendix A would appear to require the span concentration to be rounded up to 400 ppm.
However, the monitor range is 375 ppm.
May the utility round up the span concentration to the Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 10-7 Span, Calibration, and Linearity Section 10 nearest 10 ppm (310 ppm) instead of the nearest hundred ppm for such a low maximum potential concentration (MPC)? Answer: Yes.
The original Part 75 rule had required the span concentration to be rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 100 ppm, to obtain the span value.
However, this was based upon the assumption that the MPC would be at least 400 ppm.
Because this is not always true, subsequent revisions to Part 75 have clarified that when the span concentration is # 500 ppm, rounding upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm is acceptable.

Page 10-8 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 10 Answer: Span, Calibration, and Linearity Yes.
The original January 11, 1993 version of Appendix D specified only one method, ASME-MFC-9M, by which to calibrate an oil flowmeter.
Since then, EPA has revised Appendix D several times.
Included among these revisions has been the incorporation of a number of alternative procedures for of oil fuel flowmeter calibration.
Specifically, the following alternative procedures have been incorporated by reference into Section 2.1.5.1 of Appendix D, and may be used as applicable to the type of flowmeter being calibrated: (1) ASME MFC-3M-1989, with September, 1990 Errata ("Measurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes, Using Orifice, Nozzle and Venturi"); (2) ASME-MFC-5M-1985 ("Measurement of Liquid Flow in Closed Conduits Using Transit-Time Ultrasonic Flowmeters"); (3) ASME MFC-6M-1987, with June, 1987 Errata ("Measurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes Using Vortex Flow Meters"); (4) ISO 8316: 1987(E) "Measurement of Liquid Flow in Closed ConduitsMethod by Collection of the Liquid in a Volumetric Tank"; and (5) American Petroleum Institute (API) Section 2, "Conventional Pipe Provers" and API Section 5, "Master-Meter Provers", from Chapter 4 of the Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, October, 1988 (Reaffirmed, 1993).
In addition to these regulatory alternatives, EPA has approved an NIST traceable Standing Start Finish weighing method as a specific alternative to ASME MFC-9M, in response to a petition under Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.66.
ASME MFC-9M, a static weighing method, is a fuel flowmeter calibration method that compares the mass flow through a flowmeter to mass measured by a NIST approved scale.
The Standing Start Finish weighing method can be used in calibration of fuel oil flowmeters because: (1) Both ASME MFC-9M and Standing Start Finish methods use weight tank systems calibrated using NIST approved equipment.
(2) Both ASME MFC-9M and Standing Start Finish methods account for the difference in the buoyancy of air exerted in the fluid mass.
The two methods differ only in that ASME MFC-9M utilizes a diverter valve and manual timing systems, while the Standing Start Finish method uses an automatic internal quartz clock and a digital totalizer.
In either case, the scale is verified regularly using NIST standards.
If a unit uses the method above, the utility must notify EPA of the procedures and equipment being used at a particular unit as part of the certification application.

References: Key Words: History: Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.66(c); Appendix D, Sections 2.1.5.1 Calibration error, Excepted methods, Oil-fired units First published in March 1995, Update #5; revised in October 1999 Revised Manual Question 10.13 REVISED Topic: Question: Daily Calibration Error Test -- Data Validation What is EPA's policy on validation of emissions data based on the daily calibration error test? The following paragraphs summarize the provisions of Part 75 pertaining to data validation for daily calibration error tests (see Appendix B, Sections 2.1 through 2.1.5) and provide supplementary policy guidance for the implementation of those provisions.
Part 75 Rule Provisions General Provisions : Daily calibration error tests of each continuous monitor used to report data under Part 75 are required.
Additional calibration error tests are required whenever: (1) a calibration error test is failed; (2) a monitor returns to service after corrective maintenance or repair; and (3) following certain allowable calibration adjustments (see Section 2.1.3 of Appendix B).
A passed daily calibration test prospectively validates data from a continuous monitor for 26 clock hours (24 hours plus a 2-hour grace period), unless another calibration test is failed within that period.
Therefore, in order to report quality-assured data from a monitor, the data must be obtained within the 26 hour data validation window of a prior, passed daily calibration error test.
Once a 26 hour data validation window has expired, data from the monitor are considered invalid until a subsequent calibration error test is passed.
The only exception to this general rule is a grace period allowed for start up events (see discussion of grace period, below).
When a daily calibration test is failed, the data from that monitor are prospectively invalidated, beginning at the time of test failure and ending when a subsequent daily calibration test is passed.
Page 10-10 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Answer: Section 10 Span, Calibration, and Linearity On-line vs. Off-line Calibration: The basic requirement of Part 75 is that calibration error tests must be done on-line (i.e., with the unit operating), at typical operating conditions (see Section 2.1.1.1 of Appendix B).
However, if a monitor is able to pass an off-line calibration error test demonstration in accordance with Section 2.1.1.2 of Appendix B, then the limited use of off-line calibration error tests for data validation is permitted for that monitor.
Note that even if a monitor passes the off-line calibration demonstration, on-line calibration error tests of the monitor are still required, at a minimum, once every 26 unit operating hours.
Startup Grace Period: For a monitor that is not able to qualify to use an off-line calibration error test to validate data, an 8-hour startup grace period is available.
To qualify for a startup grace period, there are two requirements: (1) Following an outage of one or more hours, the unit must be in a startup condition and a startup event must have begun, as evidenced in RT 300 by a change in unit operating time from zero in one clock hour to a positive unit operating time in the next clock hour.
(2) For the monitor used to validate data during the grace period, an on-line calibration error test of the monitor must have been completed and passed no more than 26 clock hours prior to the unit outage.
If both of the above conditions are met, then a startup grace period of up to 8 clock hours is allowed before an on-line calibration error test of the monitor used to validate data during the grace period is required.
During the startup grace period, data generated by the CEMS are considered valid.
A startup grace period ends when either: (1) an on-line calibration error test of the monitor is completed; or (2) 8 clock hours have elapsed from the beginning of the startup event, whichever occurs first.
Supplementary Policy Guidance Use the following additional guidelines to implement the calibration error provisions of Part 75: (1) A valid calibration error test consists of a set of consecutive, passing zero and upscale calibrations performed within the same clock hour or adjacent clock hours.
(a) Do not report a partial calibration error test unless the partial test fails to meet the calibration error specification, in which case, treat it as a failed test.
Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 10-11 Span, Calibration, and Linearity Section 10 (b) If either the zero or upscale portion of a completed calibration error test fails, the monitor is considered to be out-of-control at the time of failure of the zero or upscale calibration.
(2) If more than one zero or upscale calibration is reported in a given clock hour, report the calibrations in time order (the order in which the calibrations were conducted).
(3) A passed calibration error test may be used to prospectively validate data for the hour in which it is performed only if, after completion of the test, the minimum data requirements of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.10(d)(1) are met for the clock hour (i.e., following the calibration error test, at least one valid data point is obtained in each of two (or more) 15-minute quadrants of the hour).
(4) A passed calibration error test may not be used to validate data if the monitor is out-of-control with respect to any of its required quarterly, semiannual or annual quality assurance tests.
(5) When a significant change is made to a monitoring system or when a monitor is repaired and additional recertification or diagnostic tests are required to demonstrate that the monitor is back in-control, a passed calibration error test may, in accordance with the provisions of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.20(b)(3), be used as a "probationary calibration error test" to initiate a period of "conditionally valid data" (see definitions in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 72.2) until the required recertification or diagnostic tests are completed.
[See also similar provisions in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 75.20(d) and Section 2.2.5.3 of Appendix B].
(6) A start-up event that commences within the grace period of a previous start-up event does not qualify for a grace period of its own.
In addition, the hours of unit downtime prior to the second startup event count toward the 8-hour grace period total (see Example 10, below).
(7) In certain instances, one or more clock hours within the 8-hour window of a startup grace period may coincide (overlap) with clock hours that are within a 26-hour window associated with a previous on-line calibration error test.
In such instances, CEM data validation is governed by whichever window (i.e., the 8-hour grace period or the 26-hour calibration window) expires last (see Example 10, below).
DETAILED EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate data validation for on-line calibration error tests and the use of a start-up grace period.
The examples assume that for the hour in which a calibration error test is passed, sufficient valid data are collected after the calibration error test to validate data for that hour.
In other words, Page 10-12 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 10 Span, Calibration, and Linearity the hour in which the calibration error test is passed is considered to be the first hour in the 26 clock hour window of data validation associated with the calibration error test.
KEY FOR EXAMPLES: P - The monitor passed a particular zero or upscale calibration F - The monitor failed a particular zero or upscale calibration Y - Yes, the monitor passed the calibration error test N - No, the monitor failed the calibration error test In examples 1 through 5 below, assume that the unit has been operating for some time, and that on Day 1 a daily calibration was passed at 7 am, (validating data from Day 1, hour 7 through Day 2, Hour 8, and that no calibration error test is failed in that interval).

Furthermore, the utility must document that the conditioned gas will not contain concentrations of other gases that interfere with instrument O2 readings (a certification statement from the vendor of the gas scrubbing system or equipment will suffice).

Would utilities with low NOx burners in use be allowed to remove the high range of 0 - 1,000 ppm? Low NOx burners (LNB) are not considered add-on emission controls.
However, as noted in Section 2.1.2.5(a) of Appendix A, installation of a low-NOx burner is an example of a change that may require a span and range adjustment.
To determine whether a new span and range are needed following the installation of a LNB, the owner or operator should examine the subsequent NOx emission data in light of the guideline in Section 2.1 of Appendix A. Specifically, Section 2.1 states: "select the range such that the readings obtained during typical unit operation are kept, to the extent practicable, between 20.0 and 80.0 percent of the full scale range of the instrument."
If the NOx concentration readings do not consistently meet this guideline, then the span and range should be adjusted accordingly.
If a span adjustment is necessary, base the maximum potential concentration (MPC) used to determine the new span value on the historical CEMS data (720 hours minimum) Answer: Page 10-18 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 10 Span, Calibration, and Linearity collected since the installation of the LNB.
If the span and range are changed, provide a monitoring plan update according to Section 2.1.2.5 of Appendix A.
For daily calibration and linearity tests, calibration gases must be used that are consistent with the new span value.

The absolute pressure and temperature transmitters are used to compensate for actual conditions.
The signals from all three transmitters are combined to determine standard cubic feet per minute flow rate in order to determine the accuracy of the system.
Appendix D, Section 2.1.5 requires each fuel flowmeter to meet a flowmeter accuracy of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2.0% of the upper range value (URV).
The utility finds it is very difficult to calibrate all three transmitters at the same time.
The temperature can be as high as 300EF, the absolute pressure is 0 - 350 psig and the differential pressure is usually 0 - 100 inches of water (@3.5 psig).
So, how should the utility calibrate and calculate the accuracy of this fuel flowmeter system? Answer: Check the calibration for the three transmitters separately.

If, at a particular level, the accuracy for each transmitter is less than or equal to 1.0% when calculated according to Equation D-1a in Appendix D, then the fuel flowmeter accuracy specification of 2.0% of the URV is considered to be met at that level.
At each level tested, report the highest calculated accuracy for any of the transmitters in RT 628 and keep the results of the tests on the other transmitters on site.
Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Page 10-19 Span, Calibration, and Linearity Section 10 If, at a particular level, the accuracy of one or more of the transmitters is greater than 1.0%, there are two alternative ways to demonstrate compliance with the fuel flowmeter accuracy specification of 2.0% of the URV: (1) If the sum of the calculated accuracies for the three transmitters is less than or equal to 4.0%, the results are considered acceptable; or (2) If the total fuel flowmeter accuracy is # 2.0% when calculated according to Part 1 of American Gas Association Report No. 3, "General Equations and Uncertainty Guidelines," the results are considered acceptable.
If the required fuel flowmeter accuracy specification of 2.0% of the URV is not met at any of the levels tested, follow the applicable procedures in Section 2.1.6.3 of Appendix D ("Failure of Transducer(s) or Transmitter(s)").

No, do not adjust the maximum potential concentrations each month based upon the concentrations during the last month.
The maximum potential concentration (MPC) is considered to be a long term value that will change only if there are significant changes to the fuel being burned or to the manner of unit operation, or if a required annual evaluation of the span and range values or an audit by the regulatory agency shows that an improper span value (and hence an improper MPC value) has been selected.

No.
Each QA operating quarter has a separate linearity requirement.
Appendix B, Section 2.2.4 Deadlines, Linearity First published in October 1999 Revised Manual Answer: References: Key Words: History: Question 10.25 Topic: Question: Aborted Calibration Test We aborted the calibration error test of our gas monitor, since the zero level failed.
How should such aborted calibrations be reported? Report the zero level results only.
Do not attempt to report any default values (e.g., "999" or "XXX") to simulate a high level injection when the test is aborted after the zero level calibration.
A single failed gas injection is considered to be a failed calibration error test and puts the monitor in an out-of-control status.

Is an instantaneous reading or a one minute average or a 15 minute average above the range considered a full-scale exceedance? Over-scaling is an exceedance of the high range of a continuous monitor, as described in Appendix A, Sections 2.1.1.5 (for SO2), 2.1.2.5 (for NOx), and 2.1.4.3 (for flow).
During hours in which the NOx concentration, SO2 concentration, or flow rate is greater than the analyzer's capability to measure, the owner or operator is instructed to substitute 200% of the full scale range of the instrument for that hour.
This is sufficiently clear for hours in which all data recorded by a monitor are off-scale.
However, the rule does not give specific instructions on how to calculate emissions during an hour in which over-scaling occurs during only part of an hour.
There are two acceptable methods for reporting hourly data when a high scale range exceedance occurs only for part of an hour.
Regardless of what method is used, the method must be implemented by the data acquisition and handling system in an automated fashion so that a value of 200% of the range is automatically substituted at the appropriate time.
The two methods are outlined below: Answer: Page 10-24 Acid Rain Program Policy Manual -- March 28, 2000 Section 10 Method 1 Span, Calibration, and Linearity (1) Establish the shortest or fundamental averaging period for which data are continuously recorded by the monitor (i.e., the time "x" required for one complete cycle of analyzing, reading, and data recording, where "x" may be 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or 60 seconds, depending on the type of data collection used in the DAHS/CEMS).
(2) If any of the fundamental readings recorded during an hour exceeds the range of the analyzer (i.e., if over-scaling occurs) then report 200% of the range for that hour and report an MODC of 20 to indicate a full scale range exceedance.
Method 2 (1) Establish the shortest or fundamental averaging period for which data are continuously recorded by the monitor (i.e., the time "x" required for one complete cycle of analyzing, reading, and data recording, where "x" may be 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or 60 seconds, depending on the type of data collection used in the DAHS/CEMS).
(2) Calculate the hourly average pollutant concentration as the arithmetic average of all fundamental data values recorded during the hour, in the following manner: (a) If the fundamental reading is lower than the analyzer range, use the reading directly in the calculation of the hourly average; (b) If the fundamental reading indicates a range exceedance, then substitute 200% of the range for that reading.
(3) Report the hourly average calculated in the manner described in step (2) above as an unadjusted concentration value and use MODC 20 to indicate that a range exceedance occurred for at least part of the hour.
