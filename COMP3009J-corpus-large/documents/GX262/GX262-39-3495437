Unlted States Department of Agriculture Agricultur$ (2.2wp;zdwe ACS Research Report 133 Marketing Operations of Dairy Cooperatives Marketing Operation of Dairy Cooperatives K. Charles Ling and Carolyn Betts Liebrand Agricultural Cooperative Service The Nation's 265 dairy cooperatives marketed 122.6 billion pounds of milk, or 82 percent of all milk sold to plants and dealers in 1992.
These cooperatives were owned by 110,440 member-producers.
Eighty-six cooperatives operated 299 dairy processing and manufacturing plants, 44 cooperatives had milkreceiving stations only, and 135 had no milk-handling facilities.
Cooperatives sold 16 percent of the Nation's packaged fluid products, 10 percent of the ice cream and ice milk, 65 percent of the butter, 81 percent of the dry milk products, 43 percent of the natural cheese, 48 percent of the dry whey products, and 13 percent of the cottage cheese made in the United States
.The prevailing method of paying for member milk by the reporting cooperatives was to adjust the milk price for both butterfat and other component(s).
Milk quality was the primary driving factor in the overwhelming majority of price incentive programs offered by cooperatives.Key Words: Cooperatives, dairy, marketing, pricing, structure.
ACS Research Report 133 April 1994 Preface Information for this report came primarily from a survey of all U.S. dairy cooperatives.
In some cases, data were estimated for nonrespondents based on their financial statements or other sources.
Data for this report came from cooperatives' fiscal year ending in calendar 1992.
Fiscal years of cooperatives vary within the calendar year, so their data reflect some differences in time periods.
However, the effects of time differences are reduced by using annual data.
Previous surveys covered the fiscal years ended April 1, 1981 and 1988.
Data prior to 1981 is covered in ACS Research Report 88.
In this report, a number of comparisons are made of regional cooperative operations based on where cooperatives are headquartered.
Because many of the larger cooperatives may have significant operations in regions other than where headquartered, there are a few cases where data may not accurately reflect the level of cooperative activity in a particular region.
Also, care should be taken when making regional comparisons because different regional alignments were used for the various analyses presented in the report.

11 ii Highlights Dairy products accounted for 35 percent of the value of all agricultural cooperative marketings during 1992.
Dairy cooperatives received or bargained for 82 percent of all milk sold by farmers to the Nation's plants and dealers.
The number of dairy cooperatives decreased 10 percent, from 296 to 265, between 1987 and 1992.
In 1992,86 cooperatives processed and manufactured dairy products, down from 121 in 1987.
Also, the number of cooperatives selling raw whole milk fell from 251 in 1987 to 230 in 1992.
Cooperatives' share of total volume sold by farmers to plants and dealers increased from 76 percent to 82 percent.
The volume of milk marketed by coop eratives increased in all regions.
Members' grade A milk marketings in 1992 accounted for 81 percent of the Nation's grade A milk, up 5 points from 1987.
While marketing of manufacturing grade milk decreased, the share increased to 62 percent of the national manufacturing grade milk production.
About 62 percent of total cooperative volume, including inter-cooperative sales, was sold as raw whole milk, up from 55 percent in 1987.
There were 110,440 member-producers delivering milk to 256 dairy cooperatives with direct members.
Three regions-East North Central, West North Central, and Middle Atlantic-together accounted for 82 percent of all memberproducers and 56 percent of cooperative milk volume.
Dairy cooperatives owned 381 plants in 1992,81 of them for receiving and shipping milk only.
They operated 80 American cheese plants and 46 Italian cheese plants; 75 fluid product packaging plants; 52 for manufacturing dry products; and 48 plants churning butter.
While net sales of butter and cheese increased from 1987 to 1992, those of dry milk products decreased.
However, cooperatives' share of national butter production decreased from 71 to 65 percent during this period.
Cooperatives' share of dry milk products (nonfat dry milk, dry buttermilk, and dry whole milk) also decreased to 81 percent of the Nation's output from 91 percent reported in 1987.
Cooperatives' sales of cheese surged 16 percent from 2.4 billion pounds to 2.8 billion pounds.
At the same time, however, national cheese production increased 21 percent.
As a result, cooperatives' share of the natural cheese market declined from 45 percent to 43 percent by 1992.
Sales of packaged fluid milk products increased both in volume and in share of market.
The 8.9 billion pounds marketed was 16 percent of the Nation's production, up from 14 percent in 1987.
Cooperatives' sales of cottage cheese as a percentage of national production remained constant at 13 percent, while share of ice cream (including ice milk) increased from 8 percent to 10 percent.
In 1992, cooperatives marketed 13 percent of the Nation's ice cream mix and ice milk mix, 3 percent of the yogurt, 27 percent of the bulk condensed milk, and 48 percent of the dry whey products.
Most dairy cooperatives continue to be relatively small business organizations.
However, through consolidation and growth, an increasing amount of dairy products was sold by larger cooperatives.
The 20 largest dairy cooperatives received 72 percent of all grade A milk marketed through cooperatives.
... 111 Highlights About 84 percent of cooperative milk processing and manufacturing was carried out by the 20 largest cooperatives with plant operations.
Findings based on responses by 153 cooperatives indicate that the traditional method of paying for milk adjusted for butterfat, with or without adjusting for other components, was the most prevalent way cooperatives paid for member milk.
Out of the 153 cooperatives, 122 offered incentive programs to induce members to produce high-quality milk and at the time and volume desirable to cooperatives, Quality incentives-the backbone of all other incentive programs-were offered by 116 of the 122 cooperatives.
iv Marketing Operations of Dairy Cooperatives K. Charles Ling Carolyn Betts Liebrand Farmer owned and operated dairy cooperatives continue to provide the most significant channel for marketing milk from the Nation's dairy farms.
In line with industry and dairy farm trends, these cooperatives are becoming fewer but are handling larger volumes.
In addition, cooperatives process, manufacture, and market a large or dominant proportion of some of the Nation's dairy products.
This report, sixth in a series of periodic appraisals of the scope and performance of dairy cooperatives, describes their continuing adaptation to an ever-changing marketing environment.
COOPERATIVE INDUSTRY PROFILE Between 1987 and 1992, the number of dairy cooperatives decreased 10 percent, from 296 to 265.
This was a slower decline than the 32-percent drop recorded from 1980 to 1987.
In 1992,81 percent of all dairy cooperatives were in the Middle Atlantic, East North Central, and West North Central regions (table 1 and fig. 1).
The greatest reduction by 1992 was in the East North Central region, where the number dropped 29 percent, from 75 to 53.
In the West North Central region, the reduction was from 77 to 72.
The Middle Atlantic region by 1992 had the most dairy cooperatives (90).
In 1992,86 cooperatives processed and manufactured dairy products that amounted to 32 percent of all dairy cooperatives.
This was less than the 41 percent recorded in 1987 when 121 cooperatives were processing and manufacturing.
Seventyone percent of the decline in the number of cooperatives that processed and manufactured dairy products occurred in the East North Central and West North Central regions.
The number of cooperatives operating only milk-receiving stations was unchanged at 44.
They represented 17 percent of all dairy cooperatives.
Thirty-six of these cooperatives, or 82 percent, were in the West North Central region.
Cooperatives that did not physically handle milk and other dairy products increased from 44 percent to 51 percent of all U.S. dairy cooperatives.
More than half were in the Middle Atlantic region.
Nationally, the number of cooperatives marketing selected major dairy products continued to decline (table 2).
More cooperatives continued to sell raw whole milk in bulk than any other product.
While the number declined from 251 to 230, the proportion of dairy cooperatives performing this activity increased from 85 percent to 87 percent.
Based on the percentage decrease in the number of cooperatives marketing various dairy products included in the survey, the numbers distributing bulk cream, cheese, butter and nonfat dry milk declined the most between 1987 and 1992.
The number of cooperatives distributing bulk cream decreased by 43 percent, while those distributing cheese decreased by 20 percent to 75 cooperatives in 1992.
Butter was distributed by 68 cooperatives, down 17 percent from 1987.
Similarly, cooperatives selling nonfat dry milk dropped 16 percent, to 26 cooperatives.
The smallest decline in the number of cooperatives occurred in those distributing cottage cheese and ice cream.
In 1992,22 cooperatives distributed cottage cheese, while 20 distributed ice cream.
The percent of dairy cooperatives distributing packaged fluid milk products remained unchanged 1 FIIJWB I- Number of Dairy Cooperatives by Headquarters Region, 1992 West North Central -- New England 5 In 81 South Atlantic 12 from 1987 at 11 percent, although actual cooperative numbers declined 15 percent, from 34 to 29 cooperatives.
The number of dairy cooperatives marketing various types of cheese was counted for the first time in the 1992 survey: 59 distributing Cheddar cheese; 38, other American cheese; 27, Mozzarella cheese; 12, other Italian cheese; and 23, other cheese.
Most of these cooperatives were in the East and West North Central regions.
Seventeen cooperatives sold dry whey products while 19 had yogurt sales.
MILK RECEIPTS AND UTILIZATION In 1992, cooperatives received or bargained for 122.6 billion pounds of milk (net of inter-coop2 erative transfers), or 82 percent of total volume sold by farmers to the Nation's plants and dealers (table 3).
Cooperatives' share of this volume was up from 76 percent in 1987.
The volume marketed by cooperatives increased 16 percent in the period, while the Nation's milk sold to plants and dealers rose 7 percent.
Cooperatives' share of the market varied considerably by region, based on their headquarter locations (fig. 2).
The Central region, with the largest number of dairy cooperatives, had 58 percent of total U.S. cooperative milk volume in 1992, down from 63 percent.
The volume of milk marketed by cooperatives headquartered in the region increased from 66.5 billion pounds to 71.6 billion pounds.
Cooperatives' share of all milk sold to F@re ~-Milk Sold to Plants and Dealers Reported by NASS, and Cooperative Share of Total by Geographic Region, 1992 P
In the Pacific region, the Nation's fastest growing milk production region, milk sold to plants and dealers increased 24 percent.
Simultaneously, cooperative volume rose 61 percent.
As a result, cooperatives' share of milk in the region increased from 63 to 82 percent.
Cooperatives' share of all milk marketed also increased in the Northeast and the South Atlantic regions, but significantly declined from 64 to 51 percent in the Mountain region.
However, milk volume marketed by cooperatives increased in all regions.
Supply, Location, and Grade There were 110,440 member-producers deli vering milk to 256 dairy cooperatives with direct members (table 4).
Most (49,015) were found in the East North Central region, followed by the West North Central region (27,376) and the Middle Atlantic region (14,577).
Together the three regions had 82 percent of total member-producers, but only 56 percent of milk delivered to dairy cooperatives.
Milk delivery per member-producer in the Pacific region was 6.7 million pounds, the highest among all regions.
It was 10 times the milk delivery per member-producer in the West North Central region and 9 times the delivery in the East North Central region.
Twenty-nine percent of the total milk received directly from member-producers and marketed by cooperatives came from farms in the East North Central region (table 4 and fig. 31, down from 30 percent in 1987.
Farms in the West North Central and Middle Atlantic regions supplied 16 and 11 percent, respectively, of the total U.S. cooperative member volume, each a decline from the previous survey.
Milk from cooperative members in the Pacific region increased from 14 percent to 19 percent of total U.S. cooperative member milk.
Ninety-one percent of the supply of cooperatives' manufacturing grade milk came from farms in the two North Central regions47 percent from the West North Central region and 43 percent from the East North Central region.
Marketings of man4 ufacturing grade milk declined 42 percent or 1.9 billion pounds in the West North Central region.
Reflecting the continuing conversion from manufacturing grade milk to grade A and the generally increased production of grade A milk, cooperatives marketed 20 percent more grade A milk for their member-producers and 38 percent less manufacturing grade milk.
Two hundred thirty four cooperatives marketed grade A milk for farmer-members and 135 marketed manufacturing grade.
In 1992, cooperative marketings of grade A milk for member-producers totaled 113.3 billion pounds or a market share of 81 percent of all grade A milk, up from 76 percent in 1987.
In the current survey year, cooperatives marketed 5.6 billion pounds of manufacturing grade milk that represented a 62 percent market share, up from 57 percent.
The proportion of grade A milk marketed by cooperatives varied from 47 percent in the East South Central region to 92 percent in the East North Central and South Atlantic regions.
A significant increase in quantities marketed and in cooperatives' share of grade A marketings was found in the Pacific region, showing 61 percent more grade A milk and an increase of market share from 63 to 81 percent.
The other increase in market share was in the South Atlantic region, expanding from 82 to 92 percent.
The East South Central region lost 20 market share points, from 67 percent to 47 percent.
All other regions either held their own or declined in grade A milk market shares.
Supply by Source In 1992,92 percent of the 131.9 billion pounds of milk received by dairy cooperatives came directly from farmers, up from 91 percent in 1987 (table 5).
Most of the remainder came from other cooperatives.
Western region cooperatives received 98 percent of their milk directly from producers.
By contrast, Eastern region cooperatives received only 84 percent of their milk directly from producers.
In 1992,235 cooperatives received 125.6 billion pounds of grade A milk from all sources, up 21.2 billion pounds (20 percent) from 1987.

5 were 6.3 billion pounds of manufacturing grade milk, down 3.9 billion pounds (38 percent).
Utilization of Milk Supply In 1992,128 billion pounds of raw milk was received from all sources by the 256 cooperatives reporting milk receipts (table 6).
Sixty-two percent of the total cooperative volume, including that received from other cooperatives, was sold as raw whole milk, up from 55 percent.
Across all regions, cooperatives sold proportionately more milk raw than they processed or manufactured in their own plants.
In the Western region, the proportion of cooperative milk sold raw jumped from 39 percent to 53 percent.
Cooperatives in the Western region processed or manufactured 47 percent of their milk in 1992, down from 61 percent in 1987.
The ratio of milk sold raw to milk processed or manufactured was about 60 to 40 in the Central region in 1992, but 50 to 50 in 1987.
The Eastern region followed the same trend-73 percent sold raw in 1992 versus 68 percent in 1987.
PLANT OPERATIONS Cooperatives owned 381 plants that performed a variety of marketing functions in 1992 (table 7).
Seventy-one percent of these plants were in the East and West North Central regions.
The Middle Atlantic region had 25 plants.
Twenty-one percent (81 plants) served only as milk receiving stations.
Most manufacturing operations were devoted to cheesemaking- making American, 46 Italian, and 10 process cheese.
Most cooperative cheese plants were in the two North Central regions.
Butter manufacturing, another important milk manufacturing function, was carried out by 48 plants, down from 69 in 1987.
Fifty-two plants manufactured dry milk products.
Cooperative butter plants were concentrated in the East and West North Central and Pacific regions.
Drying operations showed the same regional concentration.
Dry whey products were made in 40 cooperative plants, mostly in the two North Central regions.
6 Seventy-five cooperative plants packaged fluid milk products.
Unlike the milk manufacturing plants, fluid plants were scattered more uniformly throughout all regions.
West North Central region had the most with 18, followed by 13 each in the South Atlantic and East North Central regions.
Thirty-seven cooperatives plants made ice cream and 25 made cottage cheese throughout the Nation in a pattern similar to the fluid milk packaging plants.
DAIRY PRODUCTS MARKETED This section and the tables that follow describe the net volumes of major dairy products marketed by cooperatives by region after subtracting transactions among cooperatives.
The regions are based on the locations of cooperatives' headquarters.
Also, comparisons are made between the net volumes marketed by cooperatives and total U.S. production.
Other tables show the number of cooperatives marketing dairy products and the volume marketed by selected size groupings.
The tables by size groupings show both the pounds marketed and the percentage of total cooperative sales without adjustments for inter-cooperative transactions.
Raw Whole Milk Raw whole milk is the commodity most often sold by dairy cooperatives.
In 1992, net raw milk sales by 230 cooperatives amounted to 70 billion pounds or 57 percent of net total volume received (table 8).
This represented an increase in volume marketed over 1987, and also an increase in the raw milk sales as a percentage of total receipts.
During the past 5 years, the volume of raw milk sold increased substantially in all regions.
Butter Excluding inter-cooperative transfers, cooperatives distributed a net volume of 885 million pounds of butter in 1992, up 13 percent (table 9).
This represents 65 percent of total U.S. production, down from 71 percent.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::.:::.:.: Western Central Eastern 7 Pacific region dairy cooperatives accounted for 43 percent of cooperative butter sales and surpassed the volume handled by cooperatives in the Central region.
Eastern region cooperatives increased butter sales in 5 years by 78 percent, while the Pacific region was up 32 percent.
Elsewhere, butter sales declined.
While the volume of butter distributed increased, the number of cooperatives distributing it continued to decline-82 in 1987 to 68 in 1992 (table 10).
Fifteen cooperatives, each handled more than 20 million pounds, marketed 92 percent of the volume distributed by cooperatives.
The 8 cooperatives distributing more than 40 million pounds of butter each, accounted for 69 percent of cooperative butter sales.
Volume of those distributing less than 20 million pounds dropped 53 percent from 1987 to 1992 and accounted for only 8 percent of volume distributed by cooperatives in 1992 versus 18 percent in 1987.
Cheese In 1992, cooperatives distributed 2.8 billion pounds of cheese, excluding cottage cheese, up 16 percent (table 13).
During this period, the volume of total cheese made by all U.S. firms increased 21 percent.
As a result, cooperatives' share of the national cheese market decreased from 45 percent to 43 percent.
Central region cooperatives continued to distribute the largest share of cheese-88 percent of cooperatives' net sales.
Major decreases in both the volume distributed and the share of the total manufactured occurred in the Mountain region.
Pacific region cooperatives reported a 53-percent volume increase.
The number of cooperatives distributing cheese declined from 94 to 75, reflecting consolidation of cheesemaking into fewer cooperatives (table 14).
Cooperatives distributing less than 10 million pounds annually declined from 64 to 51, while those distributing more than 10 million pounds dropped from 30 to 24.
Only 11 large cooperative cheese distributors accounted for 88 percent of all cooperative cheese sales in 1992.
The 5 largest cooperatives accounted for 70 percent.
Among the 2.8 billion pounds of natural cheese distributed by cooperatives, the vast majority (1.8 billion pounds or 64 percent) was Cheddar cheese (table 15).
Cheddar cheese sales were 75 percent of total U.S. production.
Cooperatives marketed 569 million pounds of Mozzarella cheese or 29 percent of U.S. production of that type in 1992.
Other American cheese, at 290 million pounds, was the third major cheese category of cooperatives' sales, accounting for 54 percent of U.S. production.
Swiss cheese sales by cooperatives was 50 million pounds or 21 percent of U.S. Swiss cheese production.
Ten million pounds of cream cheese, or 2 percent of national production, was marketed by cooperatives.
Cooperatives also marketed 7.5 million pounds of Muenster cheese and 11.5 million pounds of Brick, Feta, Gouda/Edam, and others.
Dty Milk Products Excluding inter-cooperative transfers, cooperatives distributed 904 million pounds of dry milk products, 81 percent of the nation's 1992 production (table 11).
This volume included nonfat dry milk, dry buttermilk, and dry whole milk.
It represents a decrease in cooperatives' share of total production, down from 91 percent in 1987.
Cooperatives in the Western region surpassed the Central region in dry milk product sales-61 percent total cooperative volume in 1992.
Dry milk product volume declined 61 percent in the Central region but increased in the Eastern (6 percent) and Western (25 percent) regions.
Share of U.S. production distributed by cooperatives increased in all but the Central region.
The number of cooperatives distributing dry milk products declined from 31 to 29 (table 12).
Two-thirds of cooperatives' dry milk products was distributed by 6 cooperatives in the more than 40million-pound size group.
The 11 cooperatives that distributed more than 20 million pounds had an 81 percent share of cooperative volume.
The volume distributed by cooperatives in all size groups declined.
8 Packaged Fluid Milk Products Cooperatives distributed 8.9 billion pounds of packaged fluid milk products in 1992, reversing the 1980-87 decline, both in volume and share of total sales of all U.S. firms (table 16).
The cooperative volume of packaged fluid milk products increased 21 percent, while the cooperative market share was 16 percent, up from 14 percent.
Simultaneously, U.S. sales increased by 4 percent.
In this report, pounds of packaged fluid milk distributed by cooperatives are converted from quart equivalents of products sold.
Total industry sales are based on total pounds of milk sold to plants and dealers less the whole milk equivalent used in manufacturing.
Both volume distributed and share of all sales grew in all regions except the Western.
The Central region volume was up 36 percent and South Atlantic region up 73 percent.
Western region recorded a 42 percent loss in volume.
The number of cooperatives distributing packaged fluid milk products decreased from 34 to 29 (table 17).
The 10 large-scale cooperative distributors (each sold more than 100 million quart-equivalents) held 90 percent of all cooperative sales.
and ice milk sales by cooperatives increased 25 percent while U.S. production decreased 4 percent.
The number of cooperatives distributing these products was unchanged at 21 (table 20).
Only 5 cooperatives, each with sales of more than 10 million gallons, distributed 93 percent of total cooperative volume.
Ice Cream Mix and Ice Milk Mix In 1992,21 cooperatives reported sales of 81 million gallons of ice cream mix and ice milk mix or 13 percent of U.S. production (table 18).
This does not include mixes used by cooperatives to make ice cream or ice milk.
Bulk Condensed Milk Products In 1992, U.S. firms produced 1,624 million pounds of bulk condensed milk.
Simultaneously, cooperatives sold 439 million pounds or 27 percent of total U.S. production, down from 45 percent.
Dry Whey Products The percentage of dry whey products sold by cooperatives dipped from 53 percent to 48 percent of total U.S. production.
In 1992, cooperatives distributed 920 million pounds of dry whey products, net of inter-cooperative transfers.
As with many other products, some large-scale cooperatives distributed most of the dry whey products.
Cottage Cheese In 1992, cooperatives distributed 166 million pounds of cottage cheese, down 15 percent or 29 million pounds (table 18).
Cooperatives' share of total U.S. production remained at 13 percent, reflecting the same national volume decline.
Twenty-two cooperatives distributed cottage cheese, down from 23 in 1987 (table 19).
Four cooperatives, each distributing more than 10 million pounds a year, accounted for 72 percent of all cooperatives' sales in 1992.
Cooperative Concentration Ratios The largest cooperatives' proportion of all cooperatives' receipts of grade A milk from farmers, milk processed or manufactured, and sales of selected products for 1980,1987,1992 are shown in table 21.
It also shows the larger cooperatives' proportion of receipts, processed or manufactured volume, and sales as a percent of total U.S. production.
However, it should be noted that the cooperatives included in each size group are not the same for each product.
For example, the four largest cooperatives selling butter are not necessarily the four largest marketing cheese.
9 Ice Cream and Ice Milk While cooperatives were still a minor player in the ice cream and ice milk business, their share of the Nation's production of these frozen products increased from 8 to 10 percent (table 18).
Ice cream The 20 largest cooperatives, in terms of receipts of grade A milk, received 59 percent of the total U.S. volume of grade A milk, up from 56 percent in 1987.
However, their volume represented 72 percent of grade A milk marketed by farmers through cooperatives, down from 74 percent.
The 20 largest cooperatives with processing and manufacturing operations accounted for 84 percent of all processing and manufacturing volume by cooperatives, up from 81 percent in 1987.
The volume was 48 percent of the total U.S. milk volume sold to plants and dealers, up from 34 percent.
In 1992, the 20 largest cooperatives had an overwhelming share among cooperatives of these products: packaged fluid milk distribution, 100 percent (rounded); butter, 97 percent; dry milk products, 97 percent; and natural cheese, 96 percent.
However, compared with the Nation's total production, their shares were less significant.
The 20 largest dairy cooperatives sold only 16 percent of the Nation's packaged fluid milk and 42 percent of cheese.
They dominated only in marketing the so-called last resort products: butter and dry milk products, even though their market shares of these two products declined.
The four largest cooperatives in each product line continued to sell a significant proportion of total cooperative volume.
Their shares of total U.S. production of packaged fluid milk products and cheese increased somewhat, while shares of U.S. butter and dry milk products have declined.
METHODS OF PRICING MILK TO PAY MEMBER-PRODUCERS Dairy cooperatives were asked to describe methods of pricing members' milk.
Information on pricing incentive programs was also collected.
One hundred fifty-three cooperatives reported on their pricing methods.
They represented 58 percent of all dairy cooperatives and accounted for 86 percent of milk the Nation's cooperatives received directly from member-producers (table 22).
Difference between the percentages indicates responding cooperatives were larger in terms of volume than those not responding.
The four basic pricing methods are: 10 1.
Traditional method of paying for milk adjusted for butterfat.
2.
Traditional method of paying for milk adjusted for butterfat, and for other components.
3.
Pricing on milk components.
4.
Basing price on product yields.
Forty-six cooperatives (30 percent of respondents) used the most traditional way, representing a substantial decrease (40 cooperatives) from 1987.
A variation is adjusting milk price not only for butterfat but also for other component(s).
Eightyone cooperatives (53 percent of the respondents) used this method, up 31 cooperatives from 1987.
Twelve cooperatives priced members' milk on its components, up 7 cooperatives.
Two cooperatives based milk price on product yields, or having this pricing option available to members if they preferred.
Several cooperatives used more than one pricing method.
PRICING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS Among cooperatives providing the pricing information, 122 offered an incentive program to induce members to produce high-quality milk, and at the time and volume suited to cooperatives' operations (table 23).
The 122 represented 46 percent of all (265) dairy cooperatives and 69 percent of all members' milk.
Quality premiums only were offered by 23 cooperatives; 2 cooperatives offered only volume premiums; protein premium, seasonal premium, and solids-not-fat premium were each offered by one cooperative.
Another cooperative offered both volume and protein premiums.
Most cooperatives offered quality premiums in connection with other incentives.
These cooperatives usually require farmers to meet certain quality requirements to qualify for other premiums.
Thirty-one cooperatives offered quality, volume, and protein premiums; 21 offered quality and protein premiums; and 13 offered quality, volume, and solids-not-fat premiums.
Incentive programs offered by 116 of the 122 cooperatives (95 percent) were related to quality.
