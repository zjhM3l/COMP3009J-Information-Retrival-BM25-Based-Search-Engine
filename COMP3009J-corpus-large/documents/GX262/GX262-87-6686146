CORRELATION OF THE INFORMATION LITERACY STANDARDS AND INDIANA'S ACADEMIC STANDARDS FOR FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES Prepared by the Indiana Department of Education School Library Media Specialists' Leadership Cadre Information Literacy Task Force Committee March 2003 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The preparation of this document would not have been possible were it not for the individual and collective efforts of several key people.
The leadership role and encouragement of Phyllis Land Usher, Assistant Superintendent, Center for School Improvement and Performance provided the vision, impetus, and funding for the project from the first contact by the Association of Indiana Media Educators (AIME) leadership until completion of the first phase of this project.
Nancy McGriff, working as a member of the SLMS Cadre and the initial AIME Committee, carried the responsibility for developing the framework and assembling the personnel to develop the document.
During the 2001-2002 academic year, Vickie Thomas and Mary Watkins, members of the SLMS Cadre and state AIME chairpersons, assumed the leadership role with the correlations for music, physical education, social studies, and visual arts.
Marge Cox, AIME Past President, continued the process for the 2002-2003 academic year.
The key members of the SLMS Information Literacy Standards Task Force involved in the entire process of actual reading, writing, and editing of the correlation document are: Marge Cox, Chairperson, Media Services Director, Noblesville Schools, Noblesville, IN Deena Chambers, Family and Consumer Sciences Department Chairperson, Lewis Cass Jr/Sr High School, Walton, IN Joyce Christopher, Media Specialist, West Lafayette Jr/Sr High School, West Lafayette, IN Rose Dixon, Media Specialist, Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN Karen Nading, Family and Consumer Sciences Teacher, Columbus East High School, Columbus, IN Jane Steiner, Family and Consumer Sciences Teacher, Southmont Senior High School, Crawfordsville, IN Special recognition for their generous contribution in time and encouragement are extended to Dorothy Winchester, IDOE Director of Program Development and Peggy Wild, Family and Consumer Sciences State Specialist.

INDIANA INFORMATION LITERACY STANDARDS FOR STUDENT LEARNING The Indiana Department of Education, Office of Learning Resources, supports the need for the Indiana Academic Standards 2000 to address student library information literacy standards.
Charged with this task, the School Library Media Specialists' (SLMS) Cadre Information Literacy Task Force Committee, a collaborative committee of members of the Indiana Department of Education's Technology Leadership School Library Media Specialists and the Association of Indiana Media Educators (AIME), developed a correlation document.
It correlates to the Nine Information Literacy Standards developed by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) into Indiana's Academic Standards for Family and Consumer Sciences.
A copy of this document, Correlation of the Information Literacy Standards and the Indiana's Academic Standards Family and Consumer Sciences is available at www.doe.state.in.us/olr.
Purpose of the Correlation of Library Information Literacy Standards and Indiana's Academic Standards for Family and Consumer Sciences.
The mission of the school library program as stated in Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (1998) is to "ensure that students and staff are effective users of ideas and information."
The Correlation of the Information Literacy Standards and Indiana's Academic Standards for Family and Consumer Sciences identifies the School Library Information Literacy Standards in the newly adopted Indiana's Academic Standards for Family and Consumer Sciences.
SLMS will use these standards to work cooperatively with the building principals, classroom teachers and other professional staff members to insure that student library information literacy standards are taught through a collaborative effort in all curricular areas.
Indiana Legal Requirements for School Library Media Program The Indiana Administrative Code, 511 IAC 6.1-5.6 Media Program delineates the minimum requirements for a school library media program: Sec. 6.
All schools shall have a media program that is an integral part of the educational program.
A licensed media specialist shall supervise the media program.
Each school shall spend at least eight dollars ($8) per student per year from its 222000 account to maintain its media program.
(Indiana State Board of Education; 511 IAC 6.1-5.6; filed Jan 9, 1989, 11:00 a.m.: 12 IR 1192)
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN READING IMPROVEMENT AND SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA PROGRAM The direct relationship between reading improvement and an active school library media program staffed by a licensed professional librarian is substantiated by research studies released within the past two years in Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Alaska.
[These published studies include: How School Librarians Help Kids Achieve Standards; the Second Colorado Study (April 2000); Information Empowered; The School Librarian as an Agent of Academic Achievement in Alaska Schools (1999); Measuring Up to the Standards; The Impact of School Library Programs and Information Literacy in Pennsylvania Schools (February 2000).]
A Study of the Differences Between Higher-and Lower-performing Indiana Schools, a study by NCREL commissioned by Superintendent of Public Instruction, Dr. Suellen Reed, was published in February 2000.
The study reports one necessary component to increase student performance in lower-performing schools is to "increase student access to instructional and print materials in lower-performing schools, including regular and flexible access to a working library."
In this context, a working school library with flexible access is open during the regular school hours, is staffed by a professional, licensed school library media specialist, and provides for open and easy access by individual students.
Using best practices supports the use of collaboratively planned units involving the classroom teacher and the school library media specialist (SLMS).
Dr. David V. Loertscher in Reinventing Indiana's School Library In the Age of Technology: A Handbook for Principals and Superintendents states that the library collection shall contain the "right materials for the right learners at the right time in every format available" to support curriculum and recreational reading needs.
Through the use of Library Information Literacy Standards, teachers and SLMS work cooperatively to plan, teach, and assess the progress of students' learning.
