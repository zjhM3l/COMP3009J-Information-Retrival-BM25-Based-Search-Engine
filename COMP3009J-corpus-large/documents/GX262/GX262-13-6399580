Problem Gambling The Washington State Council on Problem Gambling hosted the 15th Annual National Conference in Seattle.
Over 400 delegates attended, including several from New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, and nations in Europe.
The Washington State Industry Working Group won the 2001 Industry award from the national chapter in recognition of its development of voluntary problem gambling practices and production of the 16-minute video entitled "The Problem Gambler: Industry Awareness."
The Behavioral Health Center of Deaconess/Spokane received the Distinguished Program Award for their treatment program for problem gamblers, which is funded primarily through Spokane area gambling facilities.
Tribal Issues In January 2001, the Snoqualmie Tribe requested negotiations for a Class III gaming compact.
In December, a legislative hearing was held on the matter.
The Commission approved the compact January 10th, 2002, and forwarded the compact to the Governor for approval.
The Tribe is in the process of obtaining trust land near Snoqualmie for its initial reservation and casino.
The compact includes provisions for Tribal Lottery System machines.
Renegotiations were held with the Muckleshoot Tribe during 2001.
The amendment would allow the Tribe to have a second facility, increased operating hours, and additional provisions.
If the tribe operates more than sixty (60) tables, then it must buy or lease the rights to those tables from another tribe.
This is similar to the "machine sharing" provisions of the Tribal Lottery System.
In August, the Skokomish Tribe opened its casino in Shelton, as authorized under its tribal/state compact.
2000 Problem Gambling -In the first part of the year, Dr. Charles Maurer, President of the Washington State Council on Problem Gambling, was elected President of the National Council on Problem Gambling.
He resigned his position with the state and was replaced by Frank Miller, formerly Director of the Washington State Gambling Commission and currently in private law practice.
-In March, the Problem Gambling/Employee Awareness video was completed and distributed to members of the industry.
The video was produced through the efforts of several gambling industry groups including tribal casinos, as well as all three of the gambling regulatory agencies (Gambling Commission, Horse Racing, and Lottery).
-After discussions with the Washington State Council on Problem Gambling, officials at Deaconness Behavioral Medicine in Spokane developed a Problem Gambling Treatment Program in Spokane, funded in part by local card room operators.
Tribal Issues -In April, the Governor approved tribal/state gaming compacts for the Samish Nation, and for the Makah, Stillaguamish, and Suak-Suiattle Tribes.

-In the Spring, some tribes entered into contracts to transfer allocation rights of Tribal Lottery System machines, as provided under the agreement resulting from the "Friendly Lawsuit."
This allowed smaller tribes to receive some economic benefit from the machines if they could not use their full allocation or did not choose to.
-In December, the Kalispel Tribe opened its casino in Airway Heights near Spokane.
Local Jurisdiction Issues During 2000, several jurisdictions enacted prohibitions on either card rooms specifically or all new gambling activities within their jurisdiction while they studied the effects of gambling on their community.

50 cities and 3 counties.
1999 - In March, the Shoalwater Tribe brings in 75 electronic gaming devices to its casino, claiming they are Class II and not subject to compact.

- In June, the Tribal Lottery System machines approved under the provisions of the "Friendly Lawsuit" begin to appear in tribal casinos.
According to the agreement, each tribe could operate 425 machines in the first year and 675 in the second.
Tribes could buy and sell allocations from each other so those with bigger casinos could offer more games, but also provides a benefit to the smaller tribes who can receive revenue by selling their allocation.
The total number of machines per tribe is capped at 1,500.
The agreement initially applies to the Chehalis, Upper Skagit, Swinomish, Port Gamble S'Klallam, Muckleshoot, Nooksack, Suquamish, Jamestown S'Klallam, Puyallup, Yakama, Squaxin Island, and Tulalip Tribes.

The Commission passed the agreement on November 2.
Governor Locke signed the agreement on November 23.
- Tribal/state compact approved in October for Kalispel Tribe, but opening of casino not anticipated until 2000.
This was the first tribe to request a casino on land acquired after 1988.
Therefore, it fell under a special provision of IGRA.
Prior to the Commission negotiating the compact, the location was approved by the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor.
- Using the "most favored nations" provisions of the compact, the Kalispel, Quinault, Nisqually, Hoh, Quileute, Skokomish, and Lower Elwha S'Klallam renegotiated their compacts after the Tribal Lottery System was approved for tribes that were part of the consensual lawsuit.
