APPENDICES 859 Appendix A Task Force Ratings The tables of ratings on the following pages were developed for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force using the methodology adapted from the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examinationa and described in Chapter ii.
For this edition of the Guide, the Task Force developed ratings for all of the topics examined.
The Task Force graded the strength of recommendations for or against preventive interventions as follows.
Strength of Recommendations A: There is good evidence to support the recommendation that the condition be specifically considered in a periodic health examination.
B: There is fair evidence to support the recommendation that the condition be specifically considered in a periodic health examination.
C: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the inclusion of the condition in a periodic health examination, but recommendations may be made on other grounds.
D: There is fair evidence to support the recommendation that the condition be excluded from consideration in a periodic health examination.
E: There is good evidence to support the recommendation that the condition be excluded from consideration in a periodic health examination.
Determination of the quality of evidence (i.e., "good," "fair," "insufficient") in the strength of recommendations was based on a systematic consideration of three criteria: the burden of suffering from the target condition, the characteristics of the intervention, and the effectiveness of the intervention as demonstrated in published clinical research.
Effectiveness of the intervention received special emphasis.
In reviewing clinical studies, the Task Force used strict criteria for selecting admissible evidence and placed emphasis on the quality of study designs.
In grading the quality of evidence , the Task Force gave greater weight to those study designs that, for methodologic reasons, are less subject to bias and inferential error.
The following rating system was used.

Appendix A
Quality of Evidence I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly randomized controlled trial.
II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.
II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention.
Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s) could also be regarded as this type of evidence.
III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience; descriptive studies and case reports; or reports of expert committees.
Well-designed and well-conducted meta-analyses were also considered, and were graded according to the quality of the studies on which the analyses were based (e.g., Grade I if the meta-analysis pooled properly randomized controlled trials).
An exact correlation does not exist between the strength of the recommendation and the level of evidence, i.e., Level I evidence did not necessarily lead to an "A" grade, nor did an "A" grade require Level I evidence.
For example, there may have been evidence of good quality that did not prove that an intervention is effective (e.g., mammography in women under age 50, which received a "C" recommendation).
On the other hand, an "A" recommendation was given to screening for cervical cancer with Papanicolaou testing, based on burden of suffering and Level II evidence supporting the effectiveness of the intervention.
For many preventive services, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not routine intervention will improve clinical outcomes ("C" recommendation).
A variety of different circumstances can result in a "C" recommendation: available studies are not adequate to determine effectiveness (e.g., insufficient statistical power, unrepresentative populations, lack of clinically important endpoints, or other important design flaws); high-quality studies have produced conflicting results; evidence of significant benefits is offset by evidence of important harms from intervention; or studies of effectiveness have not been conducted.
As a result, lack of evidence of effectiveness does not constitute evidence of ineffectiveness.
Chapter ii provides further information about the methodology used to develop the body of this report.
