STATUS OF CORAL REEFS IN THE HAWAIIAN ARCHIPELAGO STATUS OF CORAL REEFS IN THE HAWAIIAN ARCHIPELAGO David Gulko, James Maragos, Alan David Gulko, James Maragos, Alan Friedlander, Cynthia Hunter, and Russell Brainard Friedlander, Cynthia Hunter, and Russell Brainard The Hawaiian Archipelago stretches for over 2,400 km from 19o-28o N to 155o-178o E (Fig. 222).
Given the prevailing ocean currents and its distance from land masses, Hawai`i is one of the most isolated yet populated areas on earth (Juvik and Juvik 1998).
This isolation has resulted in buffering many of the region-wide and global impacts seen in other areas while allowing a wide range of urban-related impacts not seen on most Pacific island coral reefs.
Geographic isolation is also thought to have led to the high endemism seen across most marine phyla in Hawaiian waters.
The Archipelago consists of eight large islands and 124 small islands, reefs, and shoals.
It can be divided into two distinct regions: the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), primarily uninhabited atolls147, islands, and banks accounting for the majority of U.S. reefs, and the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) largely made up of populated, high, volcanic islands with non-structural reef communities, fringing reefs, and two barrier reefs.
These two regions are so distinct in terms of impacts and resources (see Table 20 on next page) that the MHI and NWHI are treated separately throughout much of this document.
Hawaiian coral reefs are rich in natural beauty and biodiversity.
The marine life also is so distinct from the rest of the Indo-Pacific Ocean that scientists treat these islands as a separate 147 ecoregion (Clark and Gulko 1999).
There are approximately 60 named species of stony corals found in the Hawaiian Archipelago (Maragos et al. in prep.).
Studies in the 1980s (Grigg 1983, Grigg and Dollar 1980) suggested that coral cover varies greatly throughout the entire archipelago.
Many reefs of the MHI lie close to the majority of the 1.2 million inhabitants, often less than 2 km from major coastal urbanization and development.
The reefs function to protect and stabilize shorelines from seasonal storm waves; are responsible for the majority of white sandy beaches important Figure 222.

The full spectrum of reef development is exemplified as geologic age increases northward through the island chain (Modified after Gulko 1998).
The one major exception to this is Midway Atoll, which has a small resident population in addition to an active ecotourism operation including commercial airline flights, catch and release fishing, and charter boat excursions.
Small permanent scientific field camps are also established on Laysan and French Frigate Shoals.

Summary of data on islands and reefs of the Hawaiian (Sources: Clark and Gulko 1999, Maragos and Holthous 1999).
Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) Introduction The eight main islands that comprise the MHI (Fig. 223) range in age from 7 million years (Kaua`i) to less than a day old (portions of the eastern side of the island of Hawai`i).
A new volcanic island (Lo`ihi) is Archipelago presently forming about 975 m below the sea surface off the southeast coast of the island of Hawai`i.
This range of age along the chain of islands provides for the majority of recognized reef types to be present (Fig 224).
The MHI are largely comprised of populated, high volcanic islands with non-structural reef communities, fringing reefs, and two barrier reefs.
Total reef area was estimated at 2,536 km2 (Hunter 1995).
Detailed mapping of underwater benthic habitats is underway and expected to be done in 2002.
Culturally, the Polynesians who first settled the MHI had strong ties to coral reefs.
According to the Hawaiian Hymn of Creation the Kumulipo, or coral polyp, was the first creature to emerge during creation.
The presentation of corals as offerings during religious ceremonies also suggests the importance of these animals and the reefs they produce was not lost on the ancient Hawaiians.
Coral reef resources provided food, medicines, building materials, and formed a portion of cultural and social customs important in ancient Hawai`i. Human impacts on Hawaiian coral reefs may have started the the construction of fish ponds atop reef flats throughout the MHI.
Wide-scale degradation of HAWAI'I HAWAI'I 156 156 148 This includes NWHI areas such as French Frigate Shoals, Midway Atoll, and Kure. may be greatly underestimated (C. Smith pers. comm.).
Endemism rates for most classes of Hawaiian algae are high.
One endemic species of seagrass (Halophila hawaiiensis) is associated with shallow reef flats on Moloka`i (Fig. 225).
Coral Grigg (1993) examined coral species distribution throughout the MHI and found the islands of O`ahu and Hawai`i had the highest coral biodiversity.
Hawaiian endemism is thought to be over 25% (Maragos 1995, Maragos et al. in prep.).
The apparently limited distribution of some endemic coral species has raised concern for their potential extinction.
Recent analyses of data by the Hawai`i Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) suggests live coral cover averages 18%149 for all sites surveyed.
This estimate may be conservative, given the limited number of sites analyzed so far, and that the weight of information was taken in shallow water (2-3 m) relative to data from greater than 10 m where coral cover is often higher.
Many reefs in Hawai`i have Figure 225.
Halophila hawaiiensis is one of many Hawaiian endemic live coral cover species (Photo: University of Hawaii Botany Department). below 20 m. Coral bleaching events that devastated reefs in many area of the Figure 223.
View of Main Hawaiian Islands from space (Photo: NASA). reefs began some 100 to 200 years ago with the expansion of Western influence on the islands.
Livestock grazing and agriculture were the primary land uses on the islands of O`ahu, Maui, Moloka`i, and Lana`i, contributing to erosion and sedimention on fringing reefs.
Dredging and filling of nearshore reefs for residential, commercial, and military expansion increased in the last century148, resulting in further loss of reef habitat.
Stream channelization and increased paving of land reduced sediment erosion but increased runoff.
Despite these changes in coastal land use, the consensus of many ecologists is that nearshore reefs off the MHI, with a few exceptions, remain in relatively good condition.
Condition of Reefs Algae and Higher Marine Plants Abbott (1995) estimated over 400 species of marine algae are found throughout the Hawaiian Islands.
Recent investigations suggest the majority of these species are red algae (Class Rhodophyta).

Timeline tracing the origins of the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamounts showing the formation and replacement of reef types over time (Modified after Gulko 1998).
Pacific during the last decade150 seemed to have missed the Hawaiian reefs.
However, the corals are suspectible to locally elevated water temperatures and/or increased ultraviolet light penetration, often at the level of individual colonies (Jokiel and Coles 1990).
At least two type of coral disease commonly occur on Hawaiian reefs general necroses and abnormal growth or `tumors' (Hunter 1999).
Necrotic coral tissues, whether caused by abrasion, predation, or pathogens, are rapidly invaded by fine filamentous algae and cyanobacteria (Fig. 226), followed by three potential outcomes: 1) recovery and overgrowth by adjacent healthy coral tissue, 2) successional change from turf to crustose coralline algae on which new coral recruits become established, or 3) persistence of the turf community resulting in net loss of coral cover.
Coral diseases and tumors have been documented in most major reef-building coral species in the MHI: Porites lobata, P. compressa, Montipora capitata, M. patula, and Pocillopora meandrina (Peters et al. 1986, Hunter 1999).
Similar to other regions, incidence of coral disease on Hawaiian reefs does not appear to be consistently associated with known anthropogenic stressors (pollutants, proximity to urban centers; Glynn et al. 1984, Peters et al. 1986, Coles 1994, Hunter 1999).
Preliminary pathological examination of two samples of diseased Porites coral tissues from Hanauma Bay, O`ahu, identified bacterial associations that were similar to those associated with white-band bisease in Florida Figure 226.

No major die-off of corals has yet been documented due to disease outbreaks in Hawai`i. Invertebrates Marine invertebrate biodiversity is relatively high in Hawai`i.
There are estimated to be over 100 sponge species (R. deFelice pers. comm.), 1071 species of marine molluscs (Kay 1995), 884 species of crustaceans (Eldredge 1995, Fig. 227), and 278 species of echinoderms (Eldredge and Miller 1995).
Except for crustaceans, rates of endemism within these groups are among the highest in the Pacific.
Major outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), which have occurred elsewhere in the Pacific, have been few in Hawai`i.
The last major occurrence was observed off Moloka`i in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Branham et al. 1971, Gulko 1998).
During this event, this seastar preyed on Montipora capitata, a species much less abundant than the dominant Porites species (J. Maragos pers. comm.).
Lack of Acropora throughout the MHI, the dominance of Porites corals on most reefs151, and the islands' overall isolation may help account for the lack of outbreaks.
Fish There are 557 species of reef and shore HAWAI'I HAWAI'I fishes in Hawai`i (Randall 1995).
The fish fauna in Hawai`i is depauperate compared to the Indo-West Pacific from which it is derived and is characterized by a large number of endemic species (Hourigan and Reese 1987, Fig. 228).
Hawai`i possesses the highest percentage of endemic warm-water marine fish fauna found anywhere in the world (24.3%).
Many of these species are 151 158 158 Corals in the family Acroporidae are among the favorite food items of crown-of-thorn starfish, while corals in the family Poritidae are not preferred, perhaps due to difficulty in digestion and symbiont defenses (Gulko 1998). among the most common and abundant components of the fish assemblage (Randall 1996).
Owing to its geographic and oceanographic isolation, a number of common fish families found throughout the Indo-Pacific region are poorly represented in Hawai`i, particularly those with a short larval duration.
A steady decline in abundance of nearshore living resources in the MHI has been reported by fishermen and researchers over the past century (Shomura 1987).
Overfishing is the major cause of the long-term statewide decline in fish abundance (Harman and Kitakaru 1988).
Fishing pressure on nearshore resources in heavily populated areas appears to exceed the capacity of these resources to renew themselves (Smith 1993) and the abundance of reef fishes in areas not protected from fishing is substantially lower than in areas where fishing is prohibited (Grigg 1994).
Under-reporting by commercial fishers and the existence of a large number of recreational and subsistence fishers without licensing or reporting requirements, have resulted in uncertainty in catch statistics for the state (Lowe 1995).
In an island state such as Hawai`i, where as much as 35% of the resident population fishes (Hoffman and Yamauchi 1972, USFWS 1988), the recreational/subsistence catch may have a large impact on the nearshore marine resources.
Creel surveys in the MHI have shown the recreational catch to be equivalent to or greater than that reported in commercial fisheries landing data (Omnitrack 1991, Hamm and Lum 1992, Everson 1994).
The few studies done in Hawai`i to date have shown that recreational fishers take a higher diversity of species with a wider variety of gear types than do commercial fishers (Omnitrack 1991, Hamm and Lum 1992, Everson 1994).
The recreational catch has been shown to be equal to or greater than the commercial catch for a number of important target species (Friedlander 1996).
Hawai`i is one of the few coastal states that does not require a saltwater recreational fishing license (Altman 1992).
A survey of the small-boat fisheries on O`ahu, with emphasis on the recreational and subsistence fisheries, was conducted from March 1990 to May 1991 (Hamm and Lum 1992).
About 41% of the total catch was identified as destined to be sold.
This figure is believed to be conservative since State law prohibits catch sales without a valid commercial fishing license.
Only 22% of the fishers interviewed identified their catch as destined to be sold.
Traps (65%) and nets (53%) had the highest proportion of sales.
Creel surveys conducted at Kane`ohe, Hanalei, and Hilo Bays have shown that there were significant differences between total and reported landings (Lowe 1995).
Several gear types (spear, crab net, gill and surround net, trolling, and pole-and-line fishing) which are primarily recreation/subsistence in nature contribute much more to the total catch than is reported in commercial landings data.
In a creel survey conducted in Kane`ohe Bay few fishers reported selling their catch (Everson 1994).
Gill netters and surround netters had the highest percentage of catch sold (12%) while less than one percent of all other fishers reported selling their catch.
A comparison of fisheries landings from Hanalei Bay, Kaua`i was made to State of Hawai`i Department of Land and Natural Resources' (DLNR) Division Aquatic Resources (DAR) commercial landings data and data obtained during a 1 1/2 year creel survey of the bay (Friedlander and Parrish 1997).
On the whole, catches estimated from the creel survey were consistently higher than those reported to DAR.
The differences ranged from a factor of less than two to more than 100 times the reported catch.
Subsistence fishing is culturally and economically important to many rural communities throughout 159 159 HAWAI'I HAWAI'I Figure 228.

Gulko 1999).
Conservation officials seized nearly five miles of net out of nearshore waters in a sixmonth period in 1998.
The lack of marine-focused enforcement and minimal fines for those few cases that have been prosecuted contribute to a lack of incentive by the population to abide by fisheries management regulations.
Most marine ornamental fish and invertebrates originating from U.S. waters come from Hawai`i, which is known for its rare endemics of high value (Fig. 229).
Based on collection reports, the annual harvest of aquarium fishes rose from 90,000 in 1973 to 422,823 in 1995, with the majority of the Figure 229.

HAWAI'I HAWAI'I Poaching is a recurring problem throughout the MHI.
There are a large number of un-licensed commercial fishers.
Take of under-sized fish and invertebrates (limpets, lobster, and octopus), and out-of-season harvests have contributed to overfishing pressure.
From a creel survey conducted in Hanalei Bay, Kaua`i, less than 30% of the omilu (a highly prized jack species) were legal for harvest and only 3% had reached the size of sexual maturity (Friedander and Parrish 1997).
The proliferation of long and inexpensive gill nets has allowed new fishers to set nets deeper and in locations not previously harvested (Clark and 1995 and 1998 by Hawai`i DAR.
Although O`ahu collectors have the greatest number of permits issued, the majority of fishers are part-time (Figure from Clark and Gulko 1999).

Marine Reptiles and Mammals There have been six species of sea turtles and 24 species of marine mammals reported on MHI reefs.
Sea turtles are fully protected under both Federal and State laws.
The threatened green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) makes use of the shallow waters of the MHI for herbivorous feeding and resting habitat, while the endangered Hawaiian hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is thought to feed, rest, mate, and nest primarily in the MHI.

Tumors are much more common on turtles near the MHI (Photo: U. Keuper-Bennett and P. Bennett).

The newly designated West Hawai`i Fish Replenishment Areas, or FRAS (Source: Hawaii DAR). aquarium collecting, the Hawai`i State legislature passed a bill in 1998 which focused on improving management of reef resources by establishing the West Hawai`i Regional Fishery Management Area.
A major component of the bill was to improve management of the aquarium industry by declaring a minimum of 30% of the western Hawai`i island coastline as Fish Replenishment Areas (FRAs) and protect areas where aquarium fish collecting is prohibited.
The FRAs restrict fish feeding by the commercial tour industry and eventually nonselective forms of fishing.
Currently, over 35% of the West Hawai`i coastline has been designated as FRAs (Fig. 231).
Commercial food harvest of invertebrates includes primarily limpets, octopus, lobster, and crabs.
A wide variety of invertebrates are harvested for the marine ornamental trade.
The harvest of sessile benthic invertebrates, especially the featherduster worm, (Sabellastarte sanctijosephi) for the aquarium trade often causes destruction of reef habitat during the collection process.

Endangered Hawaiian monk seals can still be seen on beaches of the MHI (Photo: James McVey).
The yellow-bellied sea snake (Pelamis platurus) is sometimes seen at night offshore by fishers but rarely occurs in nearshore reef environments.
The endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schaunslandi) occurs primarily in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, but occasionally is found in near-shore waters and sometimes hauls out on beaches of the MHI (Fig. 233).

Up to 60% of the turtles in Kane`ohe Bay are infected (Balazs et al. 1998). systems; most of the existing guidelines are based on non-coral reef impacts.
Oil Spills and Toxic Chemicals There is heavy Figure 234.
Nukoli Beach in Kaua`i was closed to the public in 1998 when tarballs and dead oiled birds washed ashore following a spill off Barber's Point, O`ahu (Photo: Curtis Carlson). reliance on imported oil in the islands, and therefore, oil and chemical spills are not uncommon.
Most electricity production in the MHI is based on fossil fuels (Pfund 1992).
Large urban populations, the military, and the tourist industry all use motor vehicles on all the major islands.
More than 52 billion barrels per year of crude oil are brought to O`ahu by large tanker vessels and then shipped to neighbor islands by inter-island barges.
Ship traffic, proximity of reefs to harbor entrances, and increasing numbers of vessel groundings have levels are known to encourage algal growth that resulted in more oil spills.

Basic demographic and economic data for the islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago (derived from Juvik and Juvik 1998). dieldrin and chlordane were found in oyster tissues sampled near stream mouths in Kane`ohe Bay in 1991, five years after their use was banned in Hawai`i. Lead, copper, chromium, and zinc were elevated in a number of samples, particularly near the southern, more urbanized, watersheds of the bay (Hunter et al. 1995).
There has been scant research on the fate or action of potential toxicants in Hawaiian reef biota.
Research conducted in Kane`ohe Bay by Peachey and Crosby (1995) showed a synergistic lethal effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in seawater exposed to surface ultraviolet light.
PAHs are produced as byproducts of municipal wastes and urban runoff, especially from oils used in automobiles and pavement.
Ultraviolet light transforms the PAHs into toxic forms that kill crustaceans, polychaetes, and coral larvae.
Given the extensive urbanization of coastal areas in Hawai`i, the large number of motor vehicles used on these small islands, and the channelization of streams and storm drains into nearshore reef environments, the phototoxicity posed by the introduction of PAHs has the potential to affect biodiversity and fisheries stocks.
Tourism 2000).
The marine tourism industry is thought to bring over $800 million dollars per year into the State and employs over 7,000 people in over 1,000 small busi-nesses (Clark and Gulko 1999).
Commercial fishing revenues (ex-vessel value) generate another $68.5 million annually (NMFS 2001).
Much of this (80-90%) is from pelagic, mostly longline fisheries, not coastal coral reef fisheries.
Environmental Pressures on Coral Reefs Human Stresses Nearshore coral reef environ- ments in the MHI are subject to a range of human impacts, due in part to urbanization and the majority of the population living within a few kilometers of most major reefs (Gulko 1998, Fig 235).
The impacts vary from island to island.
Alien Species Some 19 species of macroalgae have been introduced to the island of O`ahu since 1950 with at least four species being highly successful (Fig. 236).
Some of these non-native species appear to have spread throughout the main Hawaiian Islands, while others are found so far only on O`ahu.
Recent studies have shown Coastal Populations and Reef Economics In 2000, an estimated 1.2 million people resided in the MHI (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2002).
Since 1990, the size of MHI's population has increased by 9.3% (U.S. Census Bureau 2002, Table 21).
Over seven million visitors visit Hawaii; 88% of them engage in some form of marine water activity (State of Hawai`i 2000).
Tourism is the largest industry, employer and revenue generator in the entire State.
In 2000, visitor expenditures in Hawai'i totaled $10.9 billion (Hawai'i Department of Business, Economic Development, and 153 154 Figure 236.

HAWAI'I HAWAI'I overgrowth and killing of coral by the alien alga species Kappaphycus spp. in Kane`ohe Bay.
These algae are thought to have caused a shift from a predominantly coral habitat to one characterized by a large, robust single species of seaweed in some areas of the bay (Woo 2000).
Such a habitat shift is thought to affect a range of processes from reef fish recruitment to trophic interactions and may have widespread influences on activities such as commercial fishing and the $800 million/yr marine tourism industry.
Certain alien algae, such as Hypnea musiformis, often displace native or endemic algae which may be primary food items for the threatened Hawaiian green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas).
Habitat shifts caused by these alien algal species may affect critical habitat necessary for feeding, resting, and Figure 237.
Now throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago, the blueline snapper is by far the most successful fish introduction (Photos: Richard Pyle). emperor angelfish (Pomocanthus maculosus) were intentionally introduced into Hawai`i (Oda and Parrish 1981, Randall 1987).
Of these species, the blueline snapper (Lutjanus kasmira), the blacktail snapper (Lutjanus fulvus), and the bluespotted grouper (Cephalopholis argus) have established viable breeding populations in the state.
The blueline snapper has been by far the most successful and threatening fish introduction to the Hawaiian coral reef ecosystem (Fig. 237).
From some 3,200 individuals introduced around O`ahu, the population has expanded its range widely until it has now been reported over the full length of the Hawaiian archipelago (about 2,400 km).
This species competes with valuable local species for food and shelter and its small size and yellow color bring low market prices.
The bluespotted grouper is a highly piscivorous species that has become well established, especially in coral rich areas on the island of Hawai`i. Several introduced tilapia species are also thought to reduce the abundance of the valuable native mullets through competition for food and other resources (Randall 1987, Eldredge 1994).
Concerns have been raised by both the USFWS and the Hawai`i DLNR regarding aquaculture of alien marine ornamentals (including both stony and soft corals), in part due to the high endemism of Hawaiian marine species.
Introductions of terrestrial organisms (and their associated symbionts and diseases) in Hawai`i have had devastating effects on the native biota contributing to Hawai`i being classified as the `Endangered Species Capital' of the United States.
Destructive Fishing Practices Recently, mating for the endangered Hawaiian hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) (Gulko in press).
Many invertebrate species have been introduced, either accidentally or purposely, into Hawaiian waters (Eldredge 1994).
Most have not had a documented effect on coral reefs.
Alien sponges have been observed growing over corals in Kane`ohe Bay, O`ahu, and concerns have been raised about the introduced snowflake coral (Carijoa riisei) competing with shade-adapted corals in some areas (L. Eldredge pers. comm.).
At least 13 species of introduced marine fishes have become established in Hawai`i (Eldredge 1994).
Between 1951 and 1961, 11 demersal fish species six groupers, four snappers, and the 155 destructive fishing practices that involve using concentrated chlorine (`juicing') to stun or kill lobster or nocturnal food fish located deep in the recesses of coral reef holes and caverns have raised concerns about the impact of this rarely reported illegal activity.
During the Spring and Summer of 2000 unconfirmed reports of `juicing' were received from the islands of Maui, O`ahu, and Kaua`i. Unless apprehended in the act, this destructive practice is difficult to prove or document.
However, since it destroys habitat for all, most fishers in Hawai`i find such action deplorable.
Dynamite and cyanide fishing are not problems anywhere in the Hawaiian Archipelago.
HAWAI'I HAWAI'I 164 164 Oceanographic studies by the NMFS indicate that wind-driven ocean convergence zones shift southward during El NiÃ¯Â¿Â½o warming events such as occurred in 1992 and 1998 (Brainard et al. 2000), and caused the observed increases in marine debris in the MHI during these times.
The extensive use of long gill nets throughout most of the MHI is thought to have caused localized depletion of reef fish through its effectiveness and non-selectivity.
Bycatch of endangered species (sea turtles, Hawaiian monk seals) and breakage of high-relief coral colonies caused by untended nets continues despite State laws requiring that nets be checked at least every two hours and removed after four hours.
Collection of sessile benthic invertebrates for the marine ornamental trade has raised concerns about destruction of coral reef habitat from the removal of habitat-forming organisms such as anthozoans, sponges, bryozoans, and seaweeds.
Extraction of cryptic or infaunal organisms, especially the featherduster worm, often leads to destruction of habitat through the collection process.
Marine Aquaculture The Hawai`i legislature Figure 238.
A fishing net entangled around living coral colonies (Photo: National Marine Fisheries Service). recently passed a law that allows leasing of submerged lands for private enterprise.
Two companies are currently seeking leases to conduct offshore aquaculture ventures.
In both cases, proposed aquaculture facilities will be in close proximity to living coral reefs.
Concerns raised by such activities relate primarily to eutrophication of coral reef habitat from excess feed and animal wastes diffusing out of the fish cages and into reef waters, the possibility of disease introduction to wild populations, introduction of alien species or symbionts, and aggregation of reef fish around these structures where they can be easily depleted.
Marine Debris Marine debris (composed pri- shore reefs.
Stream channelization and paving of coastal and upland areas throughout much of the MHI have contributed to sedimentation impacts through removal of the vegetation that normally filters much of the runoff.
Overall sediment runoff has been estimated at greater than 1,000,000 tons per year from agricultural, ranching, urban, and industrial activities (USFWS 1996 in Green 1997).
With the decrease in `slash and burn' agriculture (sugar and pineapple) and its replacement with alternatives such as coffee, macadamia, cocoa, and fruit trees, the amount of sedimentation is expected to decrease substantially in the near future.
Rates of movement of sediments off of reef flats around the MHI varies with location; in many areas, sediments are effectively removed by seasonal wave action.
In areas such as Kane`ohe Bay, O`ahu; south Moloka`i, and Kaho`olawe Island157, decades or more may be required for Figure 239.
This U.S. Navy steel-reinforced concrete vessel has been hard aground off Shipwreck Beach, Lanai since the 1950s (Photo: Hans van Tillburg). marily of plastics, nets, lines, glass, rubber, metal, wood and cloth) is a common occurrence on reefs and shores throughout the MHI (Fig. 238).
Sources of this material vary, from beachgoers and storm drains, to industrial facilities and waste disposal sites.
In the last ten years there has been a noticeable increase in the amount of derelict fishing gear washing ashore in the MHI155.
In 1998, community groups, the military, and DLNR pulled over 3,000 kg (7,000 pounds)156 of nets and debris out of Kane`ohe Bay and Wai`anae waters during three separate clean-up days (Clark and Gulko 1999).
Coastal Runoff and Sedimentation Sedimentation caused by runoff continues to be a chronic problem throughout the MHI.
Large sediment loads are created by active agricultural practices and forsaken agricultural lands upslope of near156 157 Over 360 kg (800 lbs of broken stony corals were removed from these nets afterwards).
In the past, grazing by large populations of feral goats on Kaho`olawe Island has resulted in extensive erosion, runoff, and sedimentation of adjacent reef areas.
Currently all goats have been removed.
165 165 HAWAI'I HAWAI'I An additional concern related to shipping is the projected increase in large cruise ship traffic to the MHI. Hawai`i has one cruise ship company which Ship Groundings Ship groundings are a persisrecently acquired a second large cruise ship and tent problem (Fig. 239).
Over 16,000 commercial currently makes over 312 port calls in the MHI a and recreational vessels are registered in the State year; large, international cruise ships made 97 port of Hawai`i; with the transient commercial and calls in 1998.
This industry is projected to triple in recreational vessels, over 18,500 ships ply the the next four years (Clark and Gulko 1999).

Given the limited port facilities and the desire to have ports close proximity of coral reefs to harbors, marinas, of call throughout the islands, concerns have been and channels, groundings occur frequently, primaraised regarding anchoring areas for these huge rily small recreational boats158.
Such vessel groundships in close proximity to coral reefs on many of ings are often caused by broken moorings, inexpethe neighbor islands.

Hawai`i continues to be a major destination for recreational SCUBA divers.
Rodale's Scuba Diving Magazine rated Hawai`i as one of the top five most popular diving destinations in the world for the year 2000159; the tiny islet of Molokini was rated as the third best dive site world-wide.
Military 4% Passenger Boats 59% A number of large vessels have grounded on MHI coral reefs in the last several years (Fig. 240).
Two military amphibious vessels ran aground on reefs off the windward side of O`ahu.
In 1999 a large troop vessel struck a patch reef in Kane`ohe Bay but was quickly removed.
In 2000, a longlining fishing vessel (the F/V Van Loi) ran aground on a fringing reef directly adjacent to the shoreline of Kaua`i while enroute to the NWHI; portions of that vessel still remain atop the reef.
As with almost all civilian vessel groundings that occur in Hawai`i, the parties responsible for groundings have not had to cover the majority of the cost for vessel salvage.
For all vessels, restitution for physical damage to reef resources is rarely made.
Concerns about overuse by commercial tourism have led to early attempts at limiting access either by controlling entry to parking facilities for coastal MPAs (Hanauma Bay MLCD) or by limiting the number of mooring permits available (Molokini MLCD).
To minimize anchor damage from repetitive visits to major dive sites, DLNR, in partnership with the dive industry, has placed hundreds of day-use moorings around the MHI.
A number of companies have introduced new technologies such as tourist submarines, underwater propulsion units, `seawalkers' (a type of surface-supplied helmet rig), and rebreathers.
Concerns exist related to lack of oversight for these activities and their potential impacts.
Marine tourism is often the dominant impact in the few areas of the State set aside as no-take MPAs.
For example, over a million people a year visit the 0.65-km2 (1/4 square mile) reef of the no-take HAWAI'I HAWAI'I 166 166 158 159 Less than 15 m (46 feet).

Seawall construction has modified sand movement and affected beach structure, erosion rates, and sedimentation across reef flats (Fig. 242).
New construction of private marinas, resort hotels, and new commercial harbors provides access to coastal reef areas previously unimpacted by large numbers of human activities.

MPA Molokini Shoals MLCD.
It is not unusual to find over 40 commercial tour boats moored there at a single time.
Lack of strong controls and monitoring of impacts contribute to this problem.
Unlike many terrestrial parks and preserves, the State's no-take MPAs have no official caretaker staff or refuge managers.
Hawai`i has a large resident coastal population, many of which engage in a wide variety of marine recreation (e.g., motor boating, sail boating, thrill craft, recreational fishing, SCUBA diving, snorkeling, surfing, sailboarding, kayaking).
On Maui, Hawai`i, and O`ahu, conflicts between different user groups are commonplace and increasing.
Concerns about the impacts of thrill craft (jet skis, Kaula Rock, a small islet and a State of Hawai`i speedboats) on shallow water reef flats, seagrass Bird Sanctuary, is located 35 km southwest of the beds, and protected species (marine mammals and island off Ni`ihau.

The Natural Stresses Two major coastline of O`ahu has been freshwater kills of corals occurred extensively altered by filling in Kane`ohe Bay, O`ahu in 1965 and 1987.
Both of reef flats for coastal development and airstrips events were the result of `100 year storms' that (Maragos 1993). brought torrential rainfall to the adjacent Most islands contain reef areas that have been dredged for ship channels and harbors, or filled for coastal development.
The result has been a funcwatersheds of the bay, followed by periods of light wind and low tidal exchange (Banner 1968, Jokiel et al. 1993).
Salinity within 1-2 m of the surface Other Physical Impacts Activities involving the use of explosives and heavy machinery in the vicinity of coral reefs can have direct and indirect impacts on Hawaiian coral reef ecosystems.
The island of Kaho`olawe was used as a military target for live-firing and bombing in the latter part of the last century.
These activities contributed toward sedimentation of adjacent reef areas and resulted in the presence of unexploded ordinance in nearshore waters of Kaho`olawe.
Currently the island has been turned over to the State of Hawai`i.
It is now managed by the Kaho`olawe Island Reserve Commission, which, among other actions, has undertaken a complete assessment and monitoring program for the island's reef resources.
Military ordnance, including bombs, have been found off other small islands, that lie close to Kaho`olawe (e.g., Molokini).
167 167 HAWAI'I HAWAI'I was reduced to 15 ppt for 2-3 days, causing mass mortality of corals and sedentary invertebrates on the shallow reef tops and slopes.
In both cases, delivery of large amounts of freshwater into the nearshore environment was facilitated by channelization of streambeds and paving of lowland coastal areas throughout the watershed.
Differences in depth distributions of dominant reef corals on nearshore reefs in semi-estuarine environments may be predicted by their relative sensitivity to osmotic stress (Hunter and Krupp 1997).
After experimental treatment in conditions similar to those generated by episodic rainfall events (15 ppt salinity for 48 h), mortality was highest in Montipora capitata, intermediate in Porites compressa, and lowest in Fungia scutaria.
In P. compressa, despite complete withdrawal of tissue from colony surfaces, intact mesenteries and undifferentiated tissues (and zooxanthellae) persist in a layer 2-7 mm below the skeletal surface.
These tissues may rapidly regrow, resulting in a `phoenix-like' recovery of this species after osmostic stress.
Hawaiian Archipelago.
Warmer than normal SSTs in Hawaiian waters are generally observed during La NiÃ¯Â¿Â½a cold events.
No major bleaching events were observed in Hawai`i during the 1997-98 worldwide coral bleaching event.
Hoegh-Guldberg (1999) in a recent report on the future of global bleaching events suggested that the central Pacific, and especially Hawai`i, will be among the last reefs to experience major bleaching events.
This is thought to be mostly due to Hawaii's subtropical and northcentral location in regards to existing oceanic gyres and the broad expanse of deep water surrounding the islands.
However, many of the corals live close to their maximum temperature limits and elevated seawater temperatures may result in some level of bleaching and/or mortality (Jokiel and Coles 1990).
Current Conservation Management Mapping In 2000 NOAA and its State, Federal, and private sector partners collected aerial photography and hyperspectral imagery to develop methodologies to map the benthic habitats of the MHI (Fig. 243).

As of February 2000, CRAMP has installed and initiated monitoring at 25 sites on the islands of Kaua`i, O`ahu, Maui, Moloka`i, and Hawai`i.
The network provides a cross section of reefs across the main Hawaiian Islands with regard to habitat type, degree of environmental degradation due to various human and natural factors, and rates of recovery in damaged areas.
Initial assessment suggests that Hawaiian coral reefs are in better condition than reefs in many other regions.
Through the approval of Hawai`i Administrative Rule 13-60.3, nine Fish Replenishment Areas (roughly 35% of the West Hawai`i coastline) are now protected from aquarium fish collecting.
Bimonthly monitoring of reef fish stocks is ongoing, first documenting the impact of collecting, and now monitoring the effect of closure of sites to aquarium collecting.
Additional aspects of these FRAs will limit negative aspects of commercial marine tourism use (fish feeding) and certain fishing techniques which many feel are destructive and nonselective (gill nets).
The Office of Naval Research has placed a low frequency transmitter at a depth of 244 m off the north shore of the island of Kaua`i that broadcasts intermittently 195 dB160 low frequency (65-90 Htz) sounds into the water.
One of several such sites, this basic research is being undertaken by some of the leading oceanographic institutions in the World (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Applied Physics Laboratory of the University of WashingFigure 245.
This CRAMP diver is surveying the reef ecosystem off Maui (Photo: CRAMP).
The goals of the HCRI-RP are to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Assess major threats to coral reef ecosystems, and provide information for more effective management, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Advance the understanding of the biological and physical processes that affect the health of coral reefs and build management capacity, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Develop a database to store and access data, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Conduct public awareness programs on the threats to coral reefs, and Ã¯Â¿Â½ Implement education and training for coral reef scientists and managers.
In June of 1998, DLNR and the East West Center co-sponsored the first Hawai`i Coral Reef Monitoring Workshop (Maragos and Grober-Dunsmore, eds. 2000).
Participants recognized that Hawaii's coral reefs contribute hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the local economy through both tourism and fisheries, and that despite this importance, there were few programs in place to detect changes that might signal their existing or future degradation.
In addition, it was also recognized that monitoring was an integral function of management.
The workshop brought together regional and global experts in coral reef monitoring, coral reef research and coral reef management to compare existing methodologies and define protocols that would help revamp current management strategies and approaches.
The Hawai`i Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) is an integrated statewide monitoring program designed to describe the spatial and temporal variation in coral reef communities in relation to natural and man-made disturbances (Fig. 245).
The program involves collabora160 The term dB (decibel) is a measurement of sound volume or level; Hz (hertz) is a measure of sound frequency.

The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary is one of many MPAs protecting Hawaiian coastal resources (Photo: Lewis Herman).
Both Federal and State agencies partner to involve volunteers and the community in alien species awareness, monitoring, and mitigation.
Under the guidance of the USFWS, a large multi-agency161 partnership Marine Ecosystems Global Informational Systems (MEGIS) Group was formed over the last two years to create a computerized GIS database to share coral reef habitat maps and management data, initially for the Hawaiian Islands, and eventually for other portions of the U.S. Pacific.
In September of 1999, DLNR brought together a wide range of recognized Hawaiian academic experts and marine resource managers to develop a list of proposed Hawaiian marine species to be considered by the Federal government for candidate species status as allowed for under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
The list of recommendations needs to be sent as a petition for consideration to the NMFS Office of Protected Resources.
Those species that successfully are classified as `Candidate Species' will be considered by NMFS for possible addition to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species.
At this stage, proposed candidate species status serves to notify the public, user groups, managers, and policy makers of concerns regarding these species162 that may warrant listing in the future and facilitate voluntary conservation efforts.
A preliminary list of all species is reported in Maragos (2000).
The following criteria for listing species were proposed for consideration: restricted range, threats throughout range, limited dispersion, limited reproduction, prolonged time to reach maturity, Figure 247.

The data collected may provide insight into the global warming debate and an understanding of multi-year ocean warming/cooling events such as El NiÃ¯Â¿Â½o and La NiÃ¯Â¿Â½a.
Questions have been raised by various groups as to the possible impacts of this research activity on marine organisms ranging from reef fish and sea turtles to Hawaiian monk seals and humpback whales.
Environmental analysis conducted by the Navy and determinations by regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over coastal resources and marine mammals have indicated the project will not have adverse impacts.
A wide range of volunteer monitoring programs exist in the MHI.
The international volunteer monitoring program, Reef Check, conducts periodic surveys throughout the MHI.
Impact-specific monitoring is conducted in a number of communities on various islands.
In an effort to better coordinate these activities, provide for management applicability of the data collected, and minimize coral reef impacts caused by such volunteer activities themselves, DLNR has embarked on a program to create a number of materials for use by such groups: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Best Practices Guidelines: a pamphlet that provides best management practices for various types of activities on Hawaiian coral reefs; planned to be distributed directly to the marine tourism industry.
Visual Impact Card: uses photographs to train divers to identify specific types of coral reef impacts; for example, to distinguish coral disease from fish bites.

MPAs and No-take Reserves Closing areas to fishing is far from a new idea in the management of marine resources.
Hawaiians used a variety of traditional marine resource management practices, which included `kapus' or fishery closures.
These closures were often imposed to ensure catches for special events or as a cache for when resources on the regular fishing grounds ran low.
Various types of protected status currently exist for Hawaiian reefs and include Marine Life Conservation Districts (MLCDs), Fisheries Management Areas (FMAs), a Marine Laboratory Refuge, Natural Area Reserves (NARs), National Wildlife Refuges, and the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctu163 ary (Clark and Gulko 1999, Maragos 2000; Fig. 246; Table 22).
Several no-take MLCDs around Hawai`i have proven to be effective in increasing fish standing stock.
Less restrictive MLCDs prodata on coral reef marine protected areas (MPAs) of the `MPA' in this figure refers to Marine Protected Areas that afford some protection against certain forms of extraction, but may allow other types to occur; `No-take MPA' refers to designated MPAs where no extraction is allowed.
171 171 HAWAI'I HAWAI'I vide limited protection from consumptive practices and fish populations have not benefited significantly from the creation of these areas (Friedlander in press).
In addition, certain MLCDs are popular tourist destinations and experience intensive nonconsumptive impacts such as fish-feeding, largescale commercial marine tourism, and touristrelated pollution (Gulko 1998).
The new Kona Coast FMA, which restricts the collection of fish for the marine ornamental trade, appears to be increasing standing stocks of targeted fish species relative to nearby unprotected areas (Tissot et al. 2000).
Despite their proven effectiveness, functional no-take areas account for only 0.3% of coastal areas in state waters (Fig. 247).
On the island of O`ahu, there are three MLCDs and multiple FMAs.
Hanauma Bay was established as the state's first MLCD in 1967, and comprises 0.41 km2 (101 acres).
Taking of all marine life is prohibited in the bay.
The 0.1-km2 (25 acres) Pupukea MLCD is located on the north shore of O`ahu and was established in 1983.
Pole-and-line fishing is currently permitted from the shoreline, and taking of seaweed is also permitted.
Spearfishing without SCUBA is permitted throughout this MLCD, and the use of nets is allowed in the MLCD's northern portion.
Established in 1988, the Waikiki MLCD is very small and comprises 0.3 km2 (76 acres) at one end of Waikiki Beach.
The area consists of a lowrelief reef flat that extends approximately 35 m out to a dredged channel.
The marine area adjacent to the MLCD has been greatly altered by shoreline construction, beach nourishment, terrestrial inputs, and proximity to a large urban population.
In Figure 248.
Comparison of fish standing stock (biomass) between various O`ahu MPAs (Friedlander in press). addition to these three MLCDs, the WaikikiDiamond Head Shoreline Fisheries Management Area (FMA) is another regulated fishing area on O`ahu.
This area is adjacent to the Waikiki MLCD and extends eastward.
The area is open to fishing on even-numbered years and closed on oddnumbered years.
During the open years, nighttime spearfishing and the use of gillnets is prohibited.
These four areas represent a wide variety of sizes, habitat types, and management strategies.
Notwithstanding differences in location, size, and habitat type there is a dramatic difference in fish biomass between the Hanauma Bay MLCD and the other protected areas (Fig. 248).
A study by Brock and Kam (1993) showed that benefits derived from the Waikiki-Diamondhead Shoreline Fisheries Management Area closures were lost quickly when the area was reopened to fishing.
As a result, the overall standing stock in the zone never exceeded 50 g/m2 during their study.
The Pupukea MLCD is very small (0.1 km2) and allows a wide range of fishing activities.
Not surprisingly, this area possesses the lowest standing stock of fish compared to the other protected areas on O`ahu.
These results point to the fact that a no-take MPA with good habitat diversity and complexity can have a positive effect on fish standing stock.
No-take MLCDs around other areas of Hawai`i have also proven to be effective management strategies for increasing fish standing stock.
Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawai`i was established as an MLCD in 1969 and HonoluaMokuleia Bay on Maui was established as an MLCD in 1978.
All fishing is prohibited in specific subzones of these MPAs and the biomass of fish has increased steadily in these areas (Fig. 249) since their inception (Friedlander in press).
HAWAI'I HAWAI'I Gaps in Current Monitoring and Conservation Capacity One of the primary problems is enforcement of existing laws and regulations.
Additionally, while many State and Federal laws and regulations concern coral reefs or impacts on them, there are few that deal directly with the protection of reef ecosystems (Gulko 1998).
Many State regulations have not kept up with new technologies, new uses of natural resources, or the changes required to deal 164 172 172 165 Hanauma Bay MLCD, Pupukea MLCD, Kealakekua MLCD, and Molokini MLCD are all heavily used (and marketed) by the marine tourism industry.
Currently, MLCD's are designated based upon avail ability of public access and non-extractive use.
700 600 KG/HECTARE (3-YEAR MOVING AVERAGE) 500 400 activities would be restricted.
Given the substantial overlap of user groups in many MHI reef areas, the increasing population, and the perpetual conflict between resource utilization and conservation166, creation of such a new type of MPA is unlikely in the MHI any time in the near future.
300 200 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) Introduction The NWHI extend for more than 2,000 km (1,300 mi) to the northwest of the island of Kaua`i. From Nihoa and Necker (roughly 7 and 10 million years old respectively) to Midway and Kure atolls (~28 million years old), the NWHI represent the older, emergent portion of the Archipelago (Fig 250).
The majority of the islets and shoals remain uninhabited, although Midway, Kure, and French Frigate Shoals have all been occupied for extended periods by various government agencies over the latter portion of the last century.
With the exception of Midway Atoll, the entire NWHI is part of the State of Hawai`i from the shoreline to 3 nmi from any emerged land.
The USFWS manages Midway as a National Wildlife Refuge.
Much of the rest of the NWHI167 is within the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909, and administered by the USFWS.
The nearshore reefs of the NWHI (with the exception of some species-specific and temporally-limited fisheries depletion) are in very good to excellent condition.
In addition, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve was created by Executive Order 13178 on December 4, 2000.
This Figure 250.

with increased use versus diminished resources.
President Clinton's Executive Order 13089 for Protection of U.S. Coral Reefs (1998), mandating federal agencies make better use of their programs to protect and enhance U.S. reefs, has not yet been effectively put to the test in the MHI.
Of particular concern are federal oversight or funding of activities such as offshore aquaculture, bioprospecting, marine ornamental aquaculture, underwater sensor technology, and shoreline or harbor modification.
Current monitoring of fisheries activities in the MHI does not provide information on the recreational and subsistence fisheries that accounts for much of the catch on Hawaiian coral reefs.
Future management designs will need to consider the habitat requirements and life histories of the species of interest as well as the extent of fishing pressure in the area and the degree of enforcement.
Overuse of MHI MPAs for the tourist trade164 and the lack of any true, fully protected reserves165 is quickly eliminating the opportunity to have even a small area in the MHI that represents a natural coral reef ecosystem.
What the MHI needs is a true coral reef ecosystem reserve, where all extraction 166 167 The State legislature recently passed a regulation requiring extensive review of all new management rules for effects on small business.
Excluding Kure Atoll which is a State of Hawai`i wildlife refuge.
173 173 HAWAI'I HAWAI'I reported biodiversity of coral species (Grigg 1983, Maragos and Gulko 2002).
Coral cover for many areas of the NWHI is low, with the highest percentages at French Frigate Shoals and Maro Reef (Grigg 1983).
Recent research reports that coral cover is also high at many of the atolls (Maragos and Gulko 2002) and Neva Shoals (R. Brainard pers. obs.).
Towed diver video surveys conducted during the NOWRAMP 2000 Expedition revealed high heterogeneity within and among the different atolls, islands, and banks.
Also, growth rates for corals in the northern portion of the chain are reported to be significantly slower than the same species found farther to the south170 (Grigg 1988), raising concern about recovery rates from human impacts at different locations.
Large Mobile Invertebrates Surveys conducted in the 1970s (Okamoto and Kawamoto 1980) found only 63 species of macroinvertebrates throughout the NWHI.
Rapid ecological assessments conducted during the Fall of 2000 added to this count (Minton et al. in prep.).
Other surveys conducted within the soft sediment habitats characteristic of many atoll lagoons reported that a variety of polychaete worms and molluscs were the most abundant infauna (Sorden 1984).
The NOWRAMP survey of soft sediments identified 5,400 organisms representing 300 taxa from 63 stations (D. Turgeon pers. comm.).
Polychaetes comprised 47% of the total assemblage, followed in abundance by malacostracans (29%) and gastropods (7%).
Towed diver surveys during the NOWRAMP 2000 Expedition recorded localized areas with a moderate abundance of A. planci along the southern outer reef slope at Pearl and Hermes Atoll and along the eastern outer reef slope at Kure Atoll (R. Brainard Figure 252.

Given the large amount of shallow (
As an example, prior to the 2000 NOWRAMP expedition, there were only eight species of algae known from French Frigate Shoals, compared to the roughly 130 species collected there as a result of this expedition (P. Vroom pers. comm.).
Halophila hawaiiensis has been found at Midway Atoll and Pearl and Hermes Atoll, and may exist elsewhere in the NWHI.
Coral Previously 22 species of coral were repor- ted from the NWHI (Okamoto and Kawamoto 1980), compared with 52 species reported from the recent NOWRAMP Expedition (Maragos and Gulko 2002).
Seven species of the genus Acropora168 have been found in the NWHI, five of these have not been reported in the MHI169 (Fig 251).

These occurrences were associated with dead or dying Pocillopora colonies in areas of low coral cover.
Fish A total of 266 species of fishes is listed from Midway Atoll of which 258 are reef and shore fishes (Randall et al. 1993).
Cooler water temperatures, lack of certain high-island habitat types, and lower sampling effort may all contribute to the lower number of species compared to the main Hawaiian Islands.
The reef fish community structure in the NWHI is different from other areas in the Hawaiian Archipelago owing to reduced abundance of herbivores (mostly surgeonfishes) and the increased importance of damselfishes Figure 253.
The and carnivores (mostly jacks, sharks, (Modified after goatfishes, scorpionfishes, and bigeyes, Fig. 252).
Reef fish trophic structure in the NWHI is dominated by carnivores in numerical abundance and biomass (Parrish et al. 1985, Fig. 253).
The result is that the NWHI are among the few large reef ecosystems on the globe to remain predator-dominated and intact regarding fish assemblages (Friedlander et al. in prep.).
Because of the distances involved and the more exposed sea conditions, commercial fishers with large vessels (greater than 20 m) are the primary participants in the NWHI fisheries (Smith 1993).
Commercial fishing in the NWHI within a 100 m depth targets mostly A bottomfish and lobster, each of which is managed separately by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) through the actions of an advisory body: the Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council (WPRFMC).
Both of these B fisheries are limited-entry with less than 20 vessels allowed to operate in either fishery.
There is currently concern over the declining abundance of lobsters in the NWHI, particularly in light of their potential importance as food for the endangered Hawaiian monk 170 Apex (Top) Carnivore Carnivore Herbivore Primary Producer coral reef food web in French Frigate Shoals, NWHI Polovina 1984).
seal171.
A lawsuit was filed in federal court in 1999 regarding this issue.
Before a ruling was issued, NMFS closed the fishery when it became apparent that some of the assumptions used in the lobster population assessment model were incorrect.
Executive Order 13178, which established the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, capped the lobster take at the 2000 catch level or zero take.
Currently the NWHI lobster fishery remains closed.
Recreational and commercial fishing is prohibited within the 10-20 fathom isobath off most islands northwest of Kauai (varying with location) owing to their status as a National Wildlife Refuge managed by the USFWS, and their designation as critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal by the NMFS.
Mean standing stock of fish biomass on shallow reefs at French Frigate Shoals and Midway Atoll was almost twice as high as those reported from shallow reefs in the Main Hawaiian Islands (DeMartini et al. 1996).
The difference in biomass among these locations may reflect the heavy fishing pressure on reef fishes in the MHI compared to the NWHI (Grigg Figure 254.
Female (A) and male (B) masked angelfishes (Photos: James McVey).
171 For example, lobe coral (Porites lobata) reportedly grows at an average of 11 mm/yr in parts of the MHI while the same species grows at only 0.3 mm/yr at the northern end of the chain.
Research has shown that lobster is a constituent of the monk seal diet.
Studies on the importance of this component using fatty acid analysis and spew contents are underway by NMFS researchers.
175 175 HAWAI'I HAWAI'I 1994, DeMartini et al. 1994).
Okamoto and Kawamoto (1980) noted many inshore fish species appear to be larger at the northwestern end of the Hawaiian Archipelago.
Fishing pressure may account for the low numbers and smaller sizes of certain prized species in the MHI compared to the NWHI where fishing pressure is relatively low (Hobson 1984).
The remoteness of the NWHI makes the cost of collecting marine ornamental species there relatively high.
At present, collection of coral reef species from the NWHI for the aquarium trade is limited, although the recent sale of a number of pairs of masked angelfish (Genicanthus personatus) has raised concern for protecting such endemic and rare organisms from overexploitation.
Species such as the masked angelfish , dragon eel (Enchelycore pardalis) and the Hawaiian lionfish (Pterois sphex) are considered vulnerable and in need of protection (Fig. 254). age discharges into the lagoon at Midway during the peak population periods from of the last century may have contributed nutrients and stimulated phytoplankton and algal growth in the lagoon.
Oil Spills and Toxic Chemicals Recent oil spills in the NWHI are almost entirely due to groundings of fishing vessels on the isolated atolls.
Des Rochers (1992) identified these vessels as a primary threat to reef resources as many carry greater than 37,900 liters (10,000 gallons) and there is a history of groundings in the NWHI.
The October 1998 grounding of a 24-m longline fishing vessel at Kure Atoll released over half of its 41,640 liters of diesel onto the shallow reef environment.
Lead and PCBs were recently detected in waters surrounding seawalls on Tern Island at French Frigate Shoals (Fig. 255).
Studies by USFWS suggest that these materials may have already entered the aquatic ecosystem food chain at Tern Island.
PCBs have been measured in monk seal blood and blubber (Tummons 2000).
High PCB levels have also been observed at Midway (L. Woodward pers. comm.).
Kure, a State-administered atoll, was occupied for decades by USCG for a LORAN station and has not yet been fully evaluated for contaminants.
High concentrations of contaminants were detected in a small area at Laysan Island by USFWS specialists.
The contaminants are scheduled to soon be removed by USFWS.
Results from the NOWRAMP 2000 Expedition's preliminary survey of near-shore soft sediments off the NWHI islands and atolls identified high levels of toxic contaminants in a few sites from Midway and Kure atolls (Turgeon et al. in Maragos and Gulko 2002, Fig. 256).
At four of 38 sites, levels of Figure 257.

No turtles with fibropapillomatosis have yet been observed in the NWHI.
The endangered Hawaiian monk seal depends upon the islands and waters of the NWHI for breeding and sustenance; with a population of only 1,400 animals, this coral reef-associated seal remains one of the most critically endangered marine mammals in the United States.
Water Quality Eutrophication is not thought to be a problem in the NWHI due to lack of human habitation and distance from populated areas.
Sew172 Over 23 endangered Hawaiian monk seals have recently been found entangled in nets in the NWHI (National Marine Fisheries Service).
Figure 256.
Sediment contamination (PAHs, PCBs, DDT, lead, copper, and nickel) was in the upper 85th percentile nationally at four near-shore sites off Kure and Midway (Source: Turgeon et al. in Maragos and Gulko 2002).
PCBs, PAHs, DDT, Dieldrin, Chlordane, nickel, and copper were above the 85th percentile of concentrations measured in the coastal United States by the NOAA Status and Trends Program.
lobster fishery was thought to primarily operate over sand and algal bed habitats, surfacedeployment of lobster traps may have caused damage to benthic coral reef habitat when the fishery was open.
Marine Debris Marine debris, primarily thought to arise from derelict gear from North Pacific fisheries, is impacting a wide range of marine life found throughout the NWHI.
The gear includes drift nets, trawls, traps, and lines.
Impacts include dislodging and breaking coral colonies, and entangling and killing seabirds, monk seals172, sea turtles, and fish (Fig. 257).
Drifting marine debris may also serve as a vector for alien species introductions.
In 1996 and 1997, NMFS conducted the first surveys for derelict fishing gear in the NWHI.
In 1998, 1999, and 2000, NMFS led a multi-agency partnership involving the USCG, USFWS, DLNR, UH, the Sea Grant College Program, the Hawai`i Wildlife Society and the Center for Marine Conservation to remove marine debris from French Frigate Shoals, Lisianski, Pearl Table 23.
Chronology of reported vessel groundings and disposition in the NWHI (from DesRoches 1992, Green 1976, Clark and Gulko 1999, B. Kananaka pers comm.).
Environmental Pressures on Coral Reefs Human Stresses Terrestrial sources of sedimentation are now practically non-existent in the NWHI due to the lack of human development and the lack of erodable land mass.
The only major coastal construction in recent times occurred at Midway Atoll when it was a Naval Air Station (Maragos 1993) and involved airstrips, seawalls, roadways, large buildings, and construction of a deep draft harbor.
Localized coastal construction has occurred on islets at Kure Atoll and French Frigate Shoals in the past.
Tern Island at French Frigate Shoals was partially built of dredge spoils from the surrounding reef habitats.
The seawall at Tern Island is scheduled for rebuilding in 2002.
Alien Species Knowledge about the number and types of alien species and their range in the NWHI is very limited at this time.
The NOWRAMP 2000 Expedition indicated that alien species do not appear to be widespread in the NWHI (Maragos and Gulko 2002).
The majority of alien species have been reported at Midway, which has served as a gateway for many fouling species on the submerged hulls of ships for a period of over 60 years.
Destructive Fishing Practices There are no confirmed reports of destructive fishing practices such as cyanide or dynamite fishing.
Although the 177 177 HAWAI'I HAWAI'I and Hermes, Kure, and Midway.
The combined efforts removed over 60 tons of marine debris.
It is estimated that about 1,000 tons of marine debris still remain on the islands and reefs of the NWHI (M. Donohue pers. comm.).
Ship Groundings Ship groundings that occur in the NWHI raise special concerns due to the remote location, the pristine nature of the habitat, the exceptionally high numbers of marine endangered or protected animals present, and the effects on coral reef habitats that may be slow to recover.
In addition, ship groundings in the NWHI provide added concerns due to the extreme costs involved in assessing the damage, controlling spills, removing the vessel and follow-up mitigation (Table 23).
Recently, it has been recognized that ferrous metal from grounded vessels promote the establishment of cyanobacteria (that has displaced calcareous algae and corals atop reef flats) in remote, oceanic areas such as Rose Atoll in American Samoa.
Observations during the NOWRAMP 2000 expedition suggest that this may be occurring to a limited extent at Kure and Pearl and Hermes atolls.
In the last two years there have been three groundings of federally permitted fishing vessels atop coral reefs in State waters.
One vessel ran aground at Kure Atoll, another grounded on Kaua`i while in transit to the NWHI, and the most recent event involved a longliner that ran aground at Pearl and Hermes Atoll.
Reef structural damage from such groundings can be exascerbated if ships are not removed.
For example, when a fishing vessel, the Paradise Queen, grounded on Kure Atoll in 1988, fuel spilled and lobster traps, lines, and other loose gear threatened federally-protected green sea turtles, sea birds, and the endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Fig. 258).
Secondary damage from the breakup of this vessel by seasonal storm waves created a series of `bulldozers' that are working their way shorewards, creating more physical damage to parts of the reef unharmed by the initial grounding (Gulko and Clark 1999).
The vessel was never removed and the responsible parties have not paid any penalty.
Tourism The only tourism activity currently in Figure 258.
The fishing vessel, Paradise Queen, grounded on a coral reef at Kure Atoll, NWHI, in 1998; note the endangered Hawaiian monk seal resting in the foreground (Photo: M. Cripps). fishing, boating, diving, snorkeling, and coastal activities.
Concerns have been raised over the impact of the catch-and-release fishery at Midway.
Large jacks have been infrequently encountered on fish surveys at Midway (relative to French Frigate Shoals) since recent surveys began in 1993, and especially since the catch-and-release fishery began in 1996 (NMFS Honolulu Lab in prep.).
Concerns exist over potential commercial SCUBA-based `live aboard' boats and cruise ships working their way up the NWHI chain.
Climate Change and Coral Bleaching Declines in seabirds, monk seals, reef fishes, and phytoplankton in the NWHI from the early 1980s to early 1990s (Polovina et al. 1994) are thought to have resulted from regional decreases in oceanic productivity
(Polovina et al. 1995).
There was little monitoring for bleaching events in the NWHI during the 1997-1998 ENSO bleaching event; remnant evidence of such events was not detected during the NOWRAMP 2000 expedition.
HAWAI'I HAWAI'I Current Conservation Management Mapping The shallow-water (to a depth of approximately 30 m) coral reef ecosystems of the NWHI will be mapped using image analyses of commercially-available, high-resolution satellite imagery.
Imagery has been purchased for 10 NWHI locales.
Unvalidated draft maps have been generated for three of these Kure Atoll, Midway Atoll, and Laysan Island.
Similar maps are expected to be generated for the remaining seven areas by July 2002.
At that time, an extensive effort will be initiated to validate all maps of the NWHI shallow- the NWHI occurs at Midway Atoll under the supervision of the USFWS.
The USFWS has limited the number of visitors and workers that can be on the atoll at any one time.
Activities include 178 178 water coral reef ecosystems.
It is anticipated that final maps will be available by January 2003.
Assessment and Monitoring NOAA, USFWS, Hawai`i DLNR, the Bishop Museum, the Oceanic Institute, the University of Hawai`i, the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC), and private sector companies launched the NOW-RAMP initiative in 2000 to map and assess the status of coral reef shallow-water habitats in the NWHI (Fig. 259).
An additional expedition in 2001, sponsored primarily by the NOAA Honolulu Fisheries Laboratory with additional participation by USFWS and UCSC, provided the opportunity to collect additional information and establish data monitoring buoys on reefs at French Frigate Shoals, Maro Reef, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Atoll, Midway Atoll, and Kure Atoll, and also included limited diver observations on Raita Bank (Maragos and Gulko 2002).
An early baseline assessment of shallow reef fish populations was conducted at French Frigate Shoals and Midway Atoll during 1980-1983 by USFWS fisheries biologists.
Honolulu Laboratory biologists completed new baseline assessments at French Frigate Shoals and Midway in 1992 and 1993, respectively (DeMartini et al. 1996) and conducted annual monitoring surveys at both sites during 1995-2000 (DeMartini et al. 2002).
Since the early 1980s, NOAA Honolulu Fisheries Laboratory scientists have monitored endangered Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles off French Frigate Shoals, Laysan, Lisianski, Pearl and Hermes, Midway, and Kure.
Since 1992 NMFS has conducted annual reef fish surveys at French Frigate Shoals and Midway Atoll.
Since 1990, these scientists have also mapped NWHI underwater benthic habitats using towed divers, video cameras, and submersible vehicles.
MPAs The NWHI contain a number of examples of species-specific, limited-take MPAs.
The majority of the NWHI is classified as Critical Habitat for the endangered Hawaiian monk seal.
By federal regulation, a 50-mile protected species zone exists around the NWHI islands and atolls restricting longline fishing, and seasonal area closure zones were in effect for the take of NWHI lobster until the entire fishery was recently closed down.
173 On May 26, 2000, President Clinton directed the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, in cooperation with the State of Hawai`i, and in consultation with the Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council (WPRFMC), to develop recommendations for a new coordinated management regime to increase protection for the unique coral reef resources of the NWHI.
As a result, discussions have ensued over their trusteeship and jurisdictional authority.
The State of Hawaii holds trusteeship of all reef resources out to three nautical miles from any emerged point of land in the NWHI173.
The USFWS administers a National Wildlife Refuge throughout the NWHI (with the exception of Kure Atoll), the boundaries of which are currently being solidified and may vary in certain portions of the refuge.
NOAA currently has jurisdictional authority over most reef resources outside of three nautical miles primarily through NMFS with the WPRFMC serving in an advisory role.
The result of this effort was Executive Order 13178, which on December 4, 2000 established the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve.
The new NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve contains provisions for a number of functional notake areas distributed across the entire NWHI (with the exception of Midway) in federal waters and ranging from 25 to 100 fathoms in depth.
Other regulations to be included within these areas include restrictions on anchoring, discharge and non-extractive uses.
Midway, though geographically located within the NWHI, is the only portion of the Hawaiian Archipelago that is not part of the State of Hawai`i.
It is administered independently by the USFWS as a National Wildlife Refuge.

Gaps in Current Monitoring Multiple agency jurisdictional authority over reef resources raises questions about effective stewardship of the NWHI's coral reefs, which is arguably the last major set of reef ecosystems left in the world that have not been heavily affected by human intrusion.
The recent establishment of the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve should help sort out some of these conflicts and provide for a protective umbrella within Federal waters under which the various agencies can partner to effectively manage these unique resources.
Currently State waters are not covered within this reserve and comparable effective State management structure or resources are lacking.
This is of critical importance as many reef scientists feel that the majority of high biodiversity coral reef habitat in the NWHI is located within State waters.
Current lack of regulations controlling extractive activities within NWHI waters pose a particular problem; the proposed State of Hawai`i FMA for the NWHI may not fully close this gaping loophole to protecting this fragile and unique wilderness area.
Difficulties in patrolling and enforcing regulations throughout the 1,600 km (1,000 miles) length of the NWHI poses a problem in encouraging compliance from the various types of vessels (fishing, research, and eco-tourism) currently in the area and the large number of vessels expected to enter the area in the future.
Creation of an automated Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), with a transmitting unit required on all vessels operating in the NWHI, and which automatically notifies both the ship in question and the appropriate enforcement and resource trustees of approach to protected or off-limits174 areas would go a long ways towards effectively solving this problem given the large distances and the extremely limited resources available to the USCG and the resource trustees.
Efforts are currently underway to fund installation of VMS on various types of vessels, though how the vessels will be monitored and which agencies will have access to the data still needs to be worked out.
Management of the NWHI has been shared among agencies with differing missions.
Reliance on the WPRFMC to advise NMFS on management of NWHI fisheries resources at levels that do not impact the sustainability of the fished species, nor 174 prevent reef ecosystem damage, may have been of limited success.
Federal court litigation has occurred during the last two years relating to NMFS compliance with federal fisheries management and endangered species laws in the NWHI.
The proposed draft WPRFMC Coral Reef Ecosystem Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) proposes to manage the coral reef ecosystems of the NWHI at an ecosystem level, yet excludes all other existing FMPs from the majority of listed management measures.
Since many of the coral reef species are already listed under other existing FMPs (crustaceans, groupers, snappers, sharks) the ecosystem approach is still subordinate to single-species decision-making.
Mechanisms (such as automated VMS, active zoning, mitigative bonding) that have been successful in other managed coral reef areas of the Pacific have not been incorporated fully into the existing or proposed WPRFMC's FMPs for the NWHI.
The Hawaiian Archipelago The last two sections of this report pertain to the entire Hawaiian Archipelago.
Government Policies, Laws, and Legislation The majority of the shallow water coral reefs are under the jurisdictional authority of the State of Hawai`i (primarily DLNR).
Direct military control over areas of the NWHI has been phased out over the last 30 years; Midway was turned over to the USFWS, and the USCG abandoned LORAN stations at Kure and Tern Island (French Frigate Shoals) in the 1970s to 1980s.
In 1998, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13089 for Coral Reef Protection which mandated "All Federal agencies whose actions may affect U.S. coral reef ecosystems shall: a) identify their actions that may affect U. S. coral reef ecosystems; b) utilize their programs and authorities to protect and enhance the conditions of such ecosystems; and, to the extent permitted by law, c) ensure that any actions they authorize, fund, or carry out will not degrade the conditions of such ecosystems."
This Executive Order also focused the resources of the various agencies of the federal government to assist the State and Territorial resource trustees in making serious inroads into protection of the HAWAI'I HAWAI'I 180 180 Depending on the type of activity that the vessel is engaged in.
Public Education and Outreach for Coral Reef Protection The DLNR, as the primary resource trustee for most nearshore coral reefs throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago, has started to produce Stateof-the-Reefs Reports for distribution to the public, policy-makers, and government agencies.
DLNR also distributes a variety of pamphlets on coral reef MPAs, fishing regulations, laws and regulations and basic natural history information.
Under a grant from NOAA, the State is implementing a variety of public education and outreach projects designed to facilitate coral reef management.
These projects include community-based monitoring initiatives, a coral reef awareness raising campaign, and community-based marine debris removal coordination.
Installation of day-use mooring buoys at Molokini MLCD and an assessment of marine tourism use in State MPAs are also being funded under this grant.
The State of Hawai`i Coastal Zone Management Program has also supported both research and educational activities related to Hawaiian coral reefs.
A new booklet will be widely distributed through the local marine tourism industry to better educate visitors and help guide them in limiting their impacts on the natural resources.

To facilitate this, the President created the U. S. Coral Reef Task Force made-up of cabinet-level appointees to oversee the implementation of the Executive Order.
The State of Hawai`i has a number of existing laws and regulations concerning uses and impacts on corals and coral reefs.
Sand, rubble, live rock, and coral are protected from harvest or destruction in State waters.
Many Hawaiian stony corals are also prohibited from being sold.
Certain Administrative Rules provide for protection of marine water quality, and creation of MPAs.
The State Constitution can specifically be applied to protection of coral reef habitats.
Portions of Section 1 state that "the State and its political subdivisions shall conserve and protect Hawaii's natural beauty and all natural resources, including land, air, mineral and energy sources, and shall promote the development and utilization of these resources in a manner consistent with their conservation and in furtherance of the self-sufficiency of the State."
Section 9 of the same document states that "each person has the right to a clean and healthful environment, as defined by laws relating to environmental quality, including control of pollution and conservation, protection and enhancement of natural resources."
In the Spring of 2000, the Hawai`i Legislature passed a law banning the harvest of shark fins from State waters or landing of shark fins in the State regardless of the waters in which the sharks were caught.
The result is a lessening of the fishing pressure on sharks, including species that play a role in reef ecosystems in Hawai`i. Conclusions and Recommendations Coral reefs have always been an important component of human existence in Hawai`i, as they provide habitat and other resources for fish and invertebrates that are popular for human consumption (Fig. 260).
The nearshore reefs once provided the majority of the protein for the Hawaiian people, and today consumptive uses of reef resources include subsistence, commercial, and recreational activities.
Despite their importance, coral reefs in Hawai`i suffer from degradation related to continued human population growth, urbanization and development.
Ocean outfalls, urbanization, and massive coastal recreational development (e.g., hotels, golf courses) are presently focal points for coral reef degradation in Hawai`i (Jokiel and Cox 1996).
New technologies for extraction, offshore aquaculture, and bioprospecting raise concerns about the ability of management agencies to keep up with new impacts to coral reef resources.
Economic and business pressures to allow such 181 181 HAWAI'I HAWAI'I impacts may have severe consequences for Hawai`i where coral reefs represent a thin band of habitat directly next to the shore, yet are extremely important to the marine tourism industry which serves as a major lynchpin in the overall Hawaiian economy.
There are strong indications of overfishing for the majority of food fish and invertebrates in the MHI.
Similar concerns are starting to be expressed in regards to the impact of the marine ornamental trade.
These problems are compounded by the realization that the status of fisheries resources in the MHI are considerably under-reported, making proper management of these resources difficult at this time.
The coral reefs of the Hawaiian Archipelago represent not only the majority of U.S. reef area, but also a set of unique ecosystems of unusually high endemism and diversity of reef types, along with a uniquely predator-dominated fish assemblage within the NWHI.
Given this, issues such as alien species introduction and marine ornamental collection175, are of stronger concern here then in many other coral reef areas.
Hawai`i has a wide variety of types of MPAs which protect coral reef habitat to some extent, yet very little of MHI reefs are `No-take MPAs' where extraction of any type is not allowed.
With only 0.3% of the MHI coral reef habitat protected as `No-take MPAs,' it's going to be extremely challenging to meet the USCRTF's established goal of setting aside a minimum of 20% of the representative coral reef habitat as `No-take MPA' by the year 2010.
Even those few areas that are currently `Notake MPAs' in the MHI are exposed to heavy human usage for recreation and marine tourism potentially undermining their effectiveness in representing `natural' coral reef ecosystems.
While new efforts and joint partnerships have been initiated by the resource trustee agencies, academia, nongovernmental organizations and the various communities themselves, more support (financial and political) for the existing and proposed efforts is needed in order to effectively sustain the exceptionally wide variety and area of coral reef habitat and resources found in the Hawaiian Archipelago.
