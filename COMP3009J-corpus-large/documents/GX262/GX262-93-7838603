Chapter VII Next Steps Research undertaken to complete this Florida Intracoastal and Inland Waterway Study has been most interesting and challenging.
Information and data has been readily available, but had to be found and assimilated from many sources.
This document represents the first time a consolidated look at the Florida intracoastal and navigable inland waterway system has been undertaken from a holistic view.
3) Strategic Plan development including policies for implementing a successful scheduled container on barge service; 4) Feasibility of enhancing current operations and providing infrastructure to accommodate container on barge operations; 5) Identifying immediate and longer term needs for the waterway system; 6) Strategies for identifying and improving the critical links between key landside and waterside container on barge hub locations;
During the compiling of information and through interviews conducted with stakeholders, owner/ operators, and other interested parties, several themes emerged that begged for additional attention beyond the scope of this effort.
This document is by no means the end of the waterway investigative process, but the beginning.
The following issues will require follow up in some form (in no particular order) to assure a complete picture of the importance that the Florida Intracoastal and Inland Waterway System plays in the State's economy and transportation network:
7) Financing and maintaining the system; 8) Integrating the system into Florida's transportation planning process and Strategic Intermodal System.
For short-sea shipping and coastwise container on barge operations to work successfully in Florida, the State in the future must implement policies that support and nurture the creation of alternative transportation networks beyond conventional land side freight transportation.
It must make policy commitments to support the capital needs for water side shallow-draft systems including a mechanism
1) Land side container and freight congestion mitigation utilizing short-sea and coastal barge operations; 2) Maintenance dredging and spoil disposal for commercially authorized legs of the system;
for cost-sharing in the funding of capital and potentially the operations of such a system.
To get trucks off the highways and to improve the motoring public's safety, extensive analysis must be undertaken to examine rate structures and time sensitivity that will make a coastwise container on barge operation economically palatable to

participation by the private sector.
Granted, certain areas and legs of the existing intracoastal and inland waterway systems are off-limits to commercial navigation because of environmental concerns or other valid reasons.
That should not preempt the improvement and State support for creating a better system where feasible and economically viable.

Recommended Future Scope of Work Purpose
The Florida Department of Transportation's Strategic Florida's unique opportunity fostered by its 1,300+ mile coast line offers a means in specific high density areas to mitigate landside freight congestion and to take fiscal pressures off the state highway system by requiring it to build costly land constrained capacity.
There is another way.
Intermodal System (SIS) Steering Committee in its Final Report, Section 6: Designation Criteria released in December 2002, identified thresholds and criteria for SIS "Waterway" system definition and emerging criteria and thresholds for other water related shallow draft infrastructure.
The Study Team recommends that further research be undertaken to develop a future "Strategic Plan" for coastwise container on barge operation and shortsea shipping.
The Plan would ultimately become an integrated part of Florida's State Transportation Plan and Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), but would be of limited scope, specifically defined, and funded based on priorities designed for long-term system development that complement and not compete with land side transportation modes.
Strategic Intermodal System Criteria and Thresholds included all "Intracoastal waterways and coastal shipping lanes" this would include the federally authorized Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway or, "Inland waterways with more than .25% of total U.S. inland waterway freight traffic (1.5 million tons in 2001).
For
"Emerging" or other waterways a criteria of "providing inland inter-regional service that carries more than 0.05% of total U.S. inland waterway freight traffic (300,000 tons per year) or, serves clusters of
The Team believes that the coastwise and short-sea concept is feasible for Florida and recommends that the following long-term scope of work be seriously considered by Florida's Department of Transportation in further pursuing development of an alternative but
waterborne transportation dependent industries located in or adjacent to counties with projected employment growth among the top 25% statewide".

prioritization for enhanced commercial use of the SIS would propose that the designation for the Strategic Intermodal System for both SIS waterway facilities and emerging waterway facilities be "fine tuned" using the thresholds and criteria proposed by the Steering Committee in its Final Report.
Efforts would focus on identifying and documenting the waterway element scope requirements for SIS Strategic Plan development.
This would assure that all aspects, including facilities and criteria thresholds, are validated for strategic plan inclusion.
The intracoastal and navigable inland waterway element would be closely developed with FDOT including direct contact and input from the Florida Transportation A needs plan, unconstrained by estimates of available revenues, that identifies needs for the SIS waterways and emerging waterways, along with alternatives for addressing these needs would be developed.
A plan that identifies the costs of potential alternatives and determines which alternatives should be given priority for any available funding over a 20 year period would also be developed.
Financing strategies would be explored for both SIS waterways and the emerging waterways to leverage public and private transportation revenues to implement the plan.

Commission, Florida's seaport community key Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), growth management and environmental interests and other private sector, regional and modal partners.
Policies and statutory language would be reviewed and suggestions made to best implement the SIS waterway element in support of SIS Strategic Plan
Approach The Study Team will conduct an analysis in support of developing the intracoastal and commercially navigable inland waterway element of the SIS Strategic Plan.
The effort would include identification of planned and existing waterway connectors that satisfy the criteria, thresholds and economic connectivity measures between hubs and corridors (GIWW and AIWW) as outlined by the SIS Steering Committee; document and map these linkages based on the thresholds and criteria, and include methodologies for needs assessment and project
development.
From the data, research and
information assimilated for needs and priorities, a strategic corridor plan would be developed that highlights a detailed analysis of needs and priorities within the commercially navigable waterways system over the next 20 years.
Likewise, an "emerging waterway facilities" element would be concurrently developed with near-term, mid-term, and long-term priorities for funding and improvement that complements the corridor plan developed for the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.

Conclusion The State of Florida, because of its geography, its freight patterns and logistics, and its extensive and unimpeded coastline, has the potential to better utilize its existing intracoastal and commercially navigable inland waterway system for container and bulk commodity transport.
As stated earlier in this report, information received from stakeholder interviews and secondary sources, suggests that minimal investment would be needed in upfront capital and annual maintenance to construct and operate coastwise barge facilities, and to maintain the entire Gulf Intracoastal and Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway system to its authorized depth of 12 feet mean low water and channel width of 125 feet.
Further market research is needed to determine the proper location for coastwise container hub facilities, but as the limited research of this study attests, many of the facilities are in place and need only be enhanced with the proper infrastructure and financial incentives to entice the private sector to better use the system.
Transit time, limited schedule and frequency of service, port/intermodal facility infrastructure, necessary specialized cargo handling equipment, improved access to dedicated hubs, and breakeven container volumes all play a role in the Certainly, both the Gulf Intracaostal Waterway and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway could be classified success of an enhanced container on barge service system.
as trade corridors in and of themselves due to the annual volumes of bulk and neo-bulk commodities transported over them to serve Florida energy needs.
The next research effort requires focus on the feasibility of enhancing the existing system; identifying critical needs, and identifying strategies for effecting improvements that efficiently link the shallow draft system to land side transportation.
Primary emphasis should be placed on land side congestion mitigation through the use of barge transportation where proved practical and economically feasible.
Whatever is proposed must complement the future development of the Florida Department of Transportation's Strategic Intermodal System.
