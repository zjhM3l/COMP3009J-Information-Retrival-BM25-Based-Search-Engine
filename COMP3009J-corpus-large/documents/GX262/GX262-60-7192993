SUBJECT SERIES SCOPE AND CONTENT NOTE The Subject Series of the Confidential File consists of approximately 82,400 pages of the highest level materials in the White House Central Files.
Received at the Eisenhower Library in 1961, the Confidential File contains material on most major foreign and domestic policies as well as many political issues facing the Eisenhower administration.
Within the Subject Series the domestic topics documented include the Taft-Hartley Act, agriculture, civil aviation, science and technology programs, government agencies and their operations, security and personnel actions in the military services, Republican Party politics, and natural resources policy.
In the area of foreign policy, NATO, foreign economic policy, United States relations with the Soviet Union, Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace speech, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, trade agreements and tariff matters, mutual security programs, and the Middle East are some of the prominent issues discussed at length.
Also contained within the series is a lengthy history of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during World War II and materials relating to appeals for clemency and parole for Japanese war criminals.
Of special interest within the Subject Series are those segments dealing with the State Department and the President's trips.
Nuclear testing and disarmament, visits by foreign leaders to the United States, oil imports, foreign aid, refugee problems, and the conduct of American foreign policy are detailed in the State Department folders.
The folders on the President's trips contain materials relating to most of the President's goodwill tours and his trips to summit conferences.
In addition to the briefing books and telegrams arranging the President's various travels, there are also copies of verbatim transcripts of the proceedings of the Geneva Conference contained within the President's trips folders.
Although the date coverage of this series is essentially 1953 to 1961, there is a very small quantity of material from 1944-45.
This material, which is located within the Operation Alert folders, consists of a casefile prepared by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces on the effect of air attacks on German civilian population.
The Subject Series is organized alphabetically by subject title and chronologically thereunder.
The original folder titles on the files at the time of deposit have been retained.
Those folder titles which were assigned by the reviewing archivist have been placed in brackets [] The original arrangement within the folders has been retained, although some documents had to be refiled in order for their placement to be consistent with either the folder titles or the chronological order.
A segment of material labeled "Too Late To Be Processed" was received as part of the Confidential File.
This material, over one-half of which had been coded by the White House Central Files staff, has been interfiled into the appropriate folders.
In some instance where coding was not supplied by the Central Files staff, the material was interfiled by the reviewing archivist into folders with the same subject matter.
A total of 331 photographs were removed and transferred to the audiovisual collection.
