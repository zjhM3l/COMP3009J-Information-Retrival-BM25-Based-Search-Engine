REPORT FROM THE RURAL GIFTED TASK FORCE Findings and Recommendations Cecil J. Picard, Superintendent Louisiana Department of Education January 2002 The recommendations in this report are not mandated or policy of the State Department of Educati on or the BESE except where noted.
Rural Gifted Task Force Initiative Overview The
Louisiana State Department of Education inaugurated a Rural Gifted Task Force to address issues that are particularly pertinent to school districts with school populations under 7,000.
Prior to the task force meeting at Louisiana College in Pineville, La. on December 12, 2001, seven areas of concerns and issues were identified through monitoring citations, Office for Civil Rights citations, and district concerns.
Twenty-six participants from 20 school districts, SDE, and a university discussed these topics in small groups with a discussion facilitator in order to identify obstacles, issues, and challenges to a vision for gifted/talented programs in the rural school districts.
The participants selected a small group and were asked to discuss and provide recommendations to address the following issues: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Identification of Gifted/Talented students, especially minority students Differentiating the curriculum for G/T students G/T secondary programs Resources for G/T programs Monitoring issues Staff development for G/T teachers G/T teacher certification issues Many thanks to the participants and a special thanks to the group discussion facilitators for assisting with the task force: Linda Renegar, Madelyn Maragos, Gay Arnold, Nilda Aguirre, Phyllis Lehr, Janice Zube, and Paula Christiansen.
Appreciation is extended to Louisiana College for providing wonderful facilities.
Dr. Laura Johnson was especially helpful.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Culture and economics make a huge impact on the referrals for G/T programs.
The lack of varied experiences in the rural districts makes standardized testing and other traditional methods of screening for the Gifted/Talented program not always a measure of students' academic capabilities.
The Office for Civil Rights continues to monitor the identification procedures for Louisiana.
Identification is the key to more funding and teachers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Recommendations State Ã¯Â¿Â½ *Test more academic subjects when evaluating for gifted, i.e, science and social studies Districts Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ * Get parents, teachers, and administrators involved in child search efforts Look at inclusive screening procedures, not exclusive procedures Send a brochure home with the report card dealing with parent awareness Utilize several different evaluation instruments.
