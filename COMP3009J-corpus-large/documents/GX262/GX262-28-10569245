Productivity in crude oil and natural gas production In 1959-90, labor productivity declined in the production of crude oil and natural gas, as U.S. oil fields aged Brian L. Friedman
Increasing prices led to greatly increased U.S. industry activity in exploration and production during 1972-82.

There were three distinct periods of economic activity that produced different productivity trends during 1959-90:
1959-72, a period of increasing production and low prices
197282, a period of declining production despite the incentives of high world oil prices and technological advances
and 1982-90, a period of predominantly declining prices and continued declining production.

From 1959 to 1972, U.S. oil and gas production was growing at an average annual rate of 3.4 percent, as the addition of newly found oil reserves exceeded the depletion of existing reserves.
In general, the number of stripper oil wells declined during the period.* Stripper wells are oil wells that produce 10 or fewer barrels of oil per day.
The low price of oil made it only marginally economically feasible to keep these wells in production.
There was also little incentive to employ more sophisticated, expensive, and labor-intensive production techniques for recovering oil.
Employment declined steadily at a rate of 1.9 percent per year, and output per hour rose at a rate of 5.4 percent per year.
U.S. production of gas and oil, however, peaked in the early 1970's.
U.S. consumption became increasingly dependent on foreign supplies, which led to two shocks to industry prices.
The OPEC oil embargo occurred during 197374 and caused world oil prices to rise significantly.
Then, the cutbacks in Iranian oil production in 1979 led to another round of rapid During 1972-82, world oil price increases.

Increasing prices led to greatly increased U.S. industry activity in exploration and production during 1972-82.

percent per year.
Industry employment, however, rose 7.2 percent per year, and output per hour fell at an annual rate of 7.8 percent.
The most recent period, 1982-90, was generally a period of oversupply of foreign crude oil and declining prices.
Oil prices fell very rapidly in 1986.
Some of the more expensive and labor-intensive production techniques lost their economic feasibility.3 The number of stripper wells, which had been growing since 1970, fell by nearly 9,000 in 1987.4 Industry output continued to fall 1.2 percent per year, but employment fell 4.7 percent annually.
The industry shrank in size, but what remained were, by and large, the most efficient wells, with the best equipment, run by the most experienced personnel.5 Output per hour increased at a rate of 3.6 percent per year.
Oil prices began to rise again in 1989.
The confrontation with Iraq, beginning in August of 1990, marks the end of this period, with prices output In 1960, natural gas and petroleum products accounted for nearly 74 percent of all U.S. energy consumption.
By 1970, this percentage had grown to more than 77 percent.
Increasing prices following the OPEC oil embargo spurred energy conservation efforts in the United States.
Automobiles that provided better gasoline mileage, lower speed limits, and the switching of many utilities to coal lowered the amounts of industry products used as a percentage of total energy consumed.
Still, natural gas and petroleum products accounted for nearly 65 percent of all U. S. energy consumed in 1990.Table 1.

-1.1 2.7 -1.1 2.6 10 Monthly Labor Review March 1992 Industry products are widely used in the transportation and industrial sectors.
Gasoline accounts for around 40 percent of the use of refined petroleum.
In 1990, petroleum products and natural gas each accounted for 37 percent of industrial energy consumption.7 Petroleum products are also used for nonfuel purposes, such as asphalt, road oil, lubricants, and petrochemical feedstocks.
Natural gas is the primary source for heating households.8 The production of crude oil and that of natural gas are interrelated.
Crude oil and natural gas are found in deposits close to each other or mixed together.
Natural gas is often produced along with crude oil, with 20 to 25 percent of all natural gas produced from oil wells.
Lease condensate-liquid hydrocarbons that are removed from natural gas at the well site-are also produced by the industry.
During the first 10 years of the study period, crude oil production capacity exceeded demand.
Import ceilings were used to protect the domestic industry.9
Crude oil production rose from 7.05 million barrels a day in 1959 to a high of 9.64 million barrels per day in 1971.
By the early 1970's, demand had increased to the point where crude oil production was at 100 percent of capacity.`O Gas production grew from 12.05 trillion cubic feet in 1959 to a high of 22.65 trillion cubic feet in 1973.
Crude oil production began to decline in the early 1970's.
Much of the decline was the result of diminishing reservoir pressure in existing oil fields, combined with low levels of exploration for new oil in the 1960's.
Crude oil production declined during 7 years of the 1970's.
Production leveled out in the early 1980's, due in part to increases in exploration in the late 1970's and in part to increases in the number of new developmental wells and older stripper wells producing on existing oil fields.
World surpluses of crude oil in late 1985 and 1986, however, caused sharp declines in oil prices.
U.S. production began falling again in 1986 and continued to decline throughout the rest of the decade."
Production of natural gas was less influenced by world markets than was crude oil because of domestic price regulation and the difficulty in transporting and importing gas.
Natural gas was relatively cheap and preferred for environmental reasons.
Production increased every year from 1959 to 1973.
Low controlled prices, however, led to low natural gas reserves.
In 1978, the Natural Gas Policy Act was enacted.
The Act was designed to remove price controls gradually and stimulate production.
This, coupled with declining demand, led to an oversupply of gas in the early 1980's."
The oversupply was also due, in part, to the steady production of gas from oil wells that were producing at full capacity, despite declining demand in natural gas markets.13 Production from pure gas wells declined sharply in the early 1980's.
Total industry output of combined oil and natural gas declined during 7 years of the 1970's and every year of the 1980's except 1984.
By 1990, industry output had declined from its high in 1970 to levels slightly below those of 1965.
Employment and hours The trends for employment and hours show little relationship to output, but a very direct relationship to the price of oil.
Whenever the price of oil increased, employment increased in an attempt to produce more oil in times of high prices.
(See chart 1.)
The relationship between the price of oil and employment was a key factor influencing productivity trends in the industry.
Productivity declines were largely the result of the influx of employees and hours into the industry during periods of rapidly rising oil prices.
It became economically feasible to hire more employees, even though increases in output were only marginal.
In addition, more small companies entered the industry during times of high prices.L4 With overall production relatively flat, productivity trends were inversely related to employment trends.
(See chart 2.)
Employee hours actually declined from 1959 to 1972 at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent as prices for gas and oil increased at a rate of only 1.3 percent per year.
During this period, the slow growth in price provided little incentive for the industry to increase employment.
Employee hours, however, rose at an average annual rate of 7.4 percent from 1972 to 1982 as the price of oil rose 23.6 percent per year.
The rapid average annual decline in price (7.5 percent) from 1982 to 1989 was associated with an average annual decline of 5.2 percent in employee hours.
There is a very high proportion of nonproduction workers in the crude petroleum and natural gas production industry relative to other mining industries.
This is because most of the production workers associated with drilling and geophysical exploration are contracted from the oil field services industries, SIC 138.
For the crude petroleum and natural gas industry (SIC 131 l), nonproduction workers grew from 36.5 percent of industry employment in 1959 to 48.3 percent in 1969.
The proportion has remained at approximately 50 percent since, with a low of 48.2 percent in 1971 and a high of 56.3 percent in 198 1.
Monthly Labor Review March 1992 11 Productivity in Oil and Gas Production exploratory drilling.
While the number of exploratory oil wells increased every year during this period,17 proven reserves continued to decrease every year.
Ia
Most of the oil wells drilled during 1972-82 were development wells, designed to increase production from already discovered fields.
This type of well nearly quadrupled in number.19 The production capacity of existing oil fields was at its highest in the 1960's and began to decline in the early 1970'szo
The proportion of oil wells requiring artificial lift, or mechanical pumping, began increasing in the mid-1960's and gradually increased through the 1980's*' Average oil well production per day, which grew steadily since 1959, reached a peak in 1972 and began a gradual decline that continued throughout the 1970's and 1980's.
Average gas well production reached a peak in 1971 and began a steady and much steeper decline than did average oil well production.
In 1990, the average gas well produced only 38 percent per day as much as the average gas well did in 1971.22 Some of this downturn was in response to oversupply and came from intentional cutbacks in production, beginning in early 1982 and lasting throughout the decade.23 The nonproduction workers within the industry include engineers, computer specialists, mathematicians, and physical scientists.
There are also large numbers of administrative and clerical personnel, as well as lawyers and others involved in purchasing potential oil-producing properties.
In addition, the central administrative and auxiliary offices support a large amount of research affecting the entire oil industry.
Production workers within the industry are for the most part hoist operators, mechanics, painters, pumpers, roustabouts, truck drivers, welders, and well-service personnel.
Factors affecting productivity Productivity growth during the Aging fields.
1970's and 1980's was adversely affected by oil and gas being increasingly harder to find.
There is typically a 5- to 7-year lag from the beginning of exploratory expenditures to substantial production gains.15 The rapidly rising and falling price of oil was outside the control of the domestic industry.
The uncertainty over future oil prices led to an increasing dependence on existing oil fields.16 Some of the increased drilling activity during 1972-82 was Chart 1.
