Nature of Sales Forecasting
R-2 (1 of 2)
Businesses must make decisions relating to selling well ahead of the time the actual selling will take place.
These decisions include what to sell, how much to buy, what prices to charge, the number of employees needed, and what sales promotion will be needed.
Since it is impossible to know exactly what and how much customers will buy at a future time, these decisions must be based on estimates of what is expected to occur.
These estimates are determined using records from previous years and considering all current information available.
This estimate of future sales for a specific period of time is called a sales forecast.
Sales forecasts can cover any length of time useful to the business.
Short-term forecasts cover a year or less; intermediate forecasts cover five years or less; and long-term forecasts cover periods longer than five years.
One-year sales forecasts are the most commonly used.
Factors that affect how far ahead a business needs to predict sales include the type of product/service sold, what the business wants to accomplish (objectives), available resources, market conditions, and reasons for forecasting.
There are two basic categories of forecasting methods.
Qualitative forecasts are based on expert opinion and personal experience.
The expense involved in this method is relatively low.
Quantitative forecasts are the result of research.
The cost is higher, but the data on which decisions are made are more exact since they are based on fact, not opinion.
Businesses must decide which method to use after considering such factors as cost, accuracy, time needed for preparing the forecast, and the amount of information the business has available to use.
(New businesses may have to rely on a qualitative method due to a lack of previous records to study.)
Factors that will affect the sales forecast can be classified as internal changes and external changes.
Internal changes can be controlled by the business and include such things as personnel, promotion, pricing, product lines, distribution, and marketing strategies.
External changes such as population shifts, economic turns, Marketing Management Marketing Information Management E 13
R-2 (2 of 2) changes in competition, changes in market demand, environmental issues, and global conditions cannot be controlled by the business, but also affect predictions of sales.
Sales forecasts are used in planning inventory levels, new products, promotions, pricing, and staffing as well a scheduling production.

The video store can determine what types of videos are most popular, how often customers rent videos, what type of videos different customers rent, etc.

What are the positive and negative effects of computers in our society? Computers have affected every aspect of our lives.
They are used in our homes, at work, and in public places.
They have sped up many aspects of our lives.
For instance, we can receive a letter by fax instantly.
Saving time allows us to be more productive but, on the other hand, the speed creates more stress in our lives.
Computers provide massive amounts of information and make marketing more accurate.
However, we have less human interaction because of computers.
For instance, we may use an ATM instead of a human bank teller.
9.
What are the positive and negative effects of computer automation in the workplace? Computer automation increases productivity in the workplace.
The short-term effect could mean computers replacing human beings on the job.
But in the long term, increased productivity may mean more jobs for those who work with computers or products enhanced by computer information.

What is the Favorite Soft Drink* of Your High School? As a class, discuss what soft drinks you would like to include in your taste test.
Select at least three that are very similar in appearance, ( for example, Coke, Pepsi, and RC Cola; or Sprite, 7-Up, and Check Lemon-Lime.)
Purchase two liters of each beverage and small bathroom size cups.
You will also need a permanent waterproof marker to write on the cups.
Make your predictions as a class on which soft drink you think will win and why you selected that particular product.
Next, elect two class member to conduct a blind taste test for your class.
The two students conducting the test will be the only ones who know which product is Product A, Product B, and Product C.
One student will label cups and pour the appropriate product in each cup (one of each A, B, and C for every member in the class.)
The other student will record the response of each student on a tally sheet.
After all the class members have completed the test, elect two different class members to administer a blind taste test to the two members who conducted the class test.
Then record the results and identify the favorite soft drink of the Marketing Management Class.
Is this what you expected? Is the Marketing Management Class representative of the entire school? Well to find out you will have to sample the entire student population.
Remember a sample is just a limited number of representatives chosen from a large population.
Determine how many students to include in your sample.
Get permission from your administrator and cafeteria staff, and set up a taste testing station at the entrance to the cafeteria.
Each day for a week, have two class members conduct a blind taste test of Product A, Product B, and Product C, just as you did within your class.
Determine the number of students to survey each day and record the name of the students surveyed so they will only be included once.
Make sure you do not test any student more than one time.
