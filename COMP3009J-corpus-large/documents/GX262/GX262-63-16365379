THE FLOOD Then God, our Lord, hindered the work with a mighty flood of the great river, which at that time -- about the eighth or tenth of March [of 1543] -- began to come down with an enormous increase of water: Which in the beginning overflowed the wide level ground between the river and cliffs; then little by little it rose to the top of the cliffs.
Soon it began to flow over the fields in an immense flood, and as the land was level without any hills there was nothing to stop the inundation. ...The flood was 40 days in reaching its greatest height, which was the 20th of April, and it was a beautiful thing to look upon the sea where there had been fields, for on each side of the river the water extended over twenty leagues of land, and all this area was navigated by canoes, and nothing was seen but the top of the tallest trees... ...By the end of May the river had returned within its banks.

Lyons, Assistant Secretar y of Agriculture for Natural Resources SUBJECT: Final Repor t Forwarded herewith for your consideration is, Shar ing the Challenge: Floodplain Management into the 21st Centur y, the final report of the Interagency floodplain Management Review Committee .
In Januar y 1994 you assigned the Review Committee the mission to delineate the major causes and consequences of the 1993 Midwest flooding; to evaluate the performance of existing floodplain management and related watershed management programs.
The Review Committee also was to make recommendations to the Task Force on changes in current policies, programs, and activities of the federal government that most effectively would achieve risk reduction, economic efficiency, and environmental enhancement in the floodplain and related watersheds.
The report provides the Review Committee's findings and recommendations for action.
The thesis of the report is straightforward.
Floods will continue to occur.
The goals for floodplain management are clear.
The means to carr y out effective floodplain management exist today but need improvement and refocusing.
It is now time to organize a national effor t to conduct effective and efficient floodplain management.
It is time to share responsibility and accountability for accomplishing floodplain management among all levels of government and with the citizens of the nation.
I would emphasize that the report represents the views of the Review Committee and is based on its research and interactions with federal, state and local officials, businesses, interest groups, and individuals in and outside the upper Mississippi River Basin.
It does not necessarily represent the views of the agencies represented on the Review Committee or the views of the Administration.
It is now up to the Administration to determine which of the recommendations and actions should be implemented on what schedule .
The Review Committee appreciates the suppor t and guidance that you provided over the past six months as well as the oppor tunity to par ticipate in such an interesting and impor tant endeavor.
Gerald E. Galloway Brigadier General, U.S. Army Executive Director Thanks The Review Committee acknowledges with deep appreciation the assistance and thoughtful advice received from many federal, state, and local agencies, organizations, and individuals contacted during the course of this review.
The collective wisdom, insights and experiences of these many people provided the Review Committee with an understanding of the problems and challenges of both living in and managing the floodplain.
The Review Committee owes a debt of gratitude to those who set up and facilitated the public outreach sessions and the visits to flood affected areas.
There will never be a substitute for seeing the problem area or talking to someone who has been through a flood.

SHARING THE CHALLENGE: FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT INTO THE 21ST CENTURY The Report of the Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee ABSTRACT June 1994 The Midwest Flood of 1993 was a significant hydrometeorological event.
In some areas it represented an unusual event; in most others, however, it was just another of the many that have been seen before and will be seen again.
Flood flows similar to those experienced by most of the Midwest can occur at any time.
During the decade ending in 1993, average annual flood damages in the United States exceed $3 billion.
Flood damages are not a national problem.
Excessive rainfall, which produced standing water, saturated soils, and overland flow, caused major damages to upland agriculture and some communities.
In turn, runoff from this rainfall created, throughout the basin, flood events that became a part of the nation's 1993 TV experience.
Damages overall were extensive: between $12 billion and $16 billion that can be counted, and a large amount in unquantifiable impacts on the health and wellbeing of the population of the Midwest.
Human activities in the floodplains of the Midwest over the last three centuries have placed people and property at risk.
Local and federal flood damage reduction projects were constructed to minimize the annual risk, and, during the 1993 flood, prevented nearly $20 billion in damages.
Some of these programs, however, attracted people to high risk areas and created greater exposure to future damages.
In addition, flood control, navigation, and agricultural activities severely reduced available floodplain habitat and compromised natural functions upon which fish and wildlife rely.
Over the last 30 years the nation has learned that effective floodplain management can reduce vulnerability to damages and create a balance among natural and human uses of floodplains and their related watersheds to meet both social and environmental goals.
The nation, however, has not taken full advantage of this knowledge.
The United States simply has lacked the focus and incentive to engage itself seriously in floodplain management.
The 1993 flood has managed to focus attention on the floodplain and has provided the incentive for action.
The Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee proposes a better way to manage the floodplains.
It begins by establishing that all levels of government, all businesses and all citizens have a stake in properly managing the floodplain.
All of those who support risky behavior, either directly or indirectly, must share in floodplain management and in the costs of reducing that risk.
The federal government can lead by example; but state and local governments must manage their own floodplains.
Individual citizens must adjust their actions to the risk they face and bear a greater share of the economic costs.
The Review Committee supports a floodplain management strategy of, sequentially, avoiding inappropriate use of the floodplain, minimizing vulnerability to damage through both structural and nonstructural means, and mitigating flood damages when they do occur.
By controlling runoff, managing ecosystems for all their benefits, planning the use of the land and identifying those areas at risk; many hazards can be avoided.
Where the risk cannot be avoided, damage minimization approaches, such as elevation and relocation of buildings or construction of reservoirs or flood protection structures, are used only when they can be integrated into a systems approach to flood damage reduction in the basin.
When floods occur, impacts on individuals and communities can be mitigated with a flood insurance program that is funded by those who are protected.
Full disaster support for those in the floodplain is contingent on their participation in these self-help mitigation programs.
Measures that internalize risks reduce the moral hazard associated with full government support.
To ensure a long-term, nationwide approach to floodplain management, the Review Committee proposes legislation v to develop and fund a national Floodplain Management Program with principal responsibility and accountability at the state level.
It also proposes revitalization of the federal Water Resources Council to better coordinate federal activities, limited restoration of some basin commissions for basin-wide planning, and issuance of a Presidential Executive Order requiring federal agencies to follow floodplain management principles in the execution of their programs.
The upper Mississippi River Basin includes both individually authorized federal flood damage reduction projects and levees built by local groups and individuals.
This pattern of development is unique and requires a unique approach.
The Review Committee proposes a plan to identify and evaluate the needs of the basin, to ensure the integrity of a flood damage reduction system that meets the needs of the basin, and to restore natural floodplain functions on appropriate lands.
The nation knows where to go with floodplain management and how to get there.
This report provides a map showing the shortest route to success.
The nation now must take the actions required to do so. vi REPORT OF THE INTERAGENCY FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE to the ADMINISTRATION FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The time has come to fact the fact that this Nation can no longer afford the high costs of natural disasters.
We can no longer afford the economic costs to the American taxpayer, nor can we afford the social costs to our communities and individuals.
James L. Witt Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency Testimony before Congress, October 27, 1993 FLOODPLAINS AND THE NATION The upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their tributaries have played a major role in the nation's history.
Their existence was critical to the growth of the upper Midwest region of the United States and fostered the development of major cities and a transportation network linking the region to the rest of the world.
The floodplains of these rivers provide some of the most productive farmland in the country.
They offer diverse recreational opportunities and contain important ecological systems.
While development of the region has produced significant benefits, it has not always been conducted in a wise manner.
As a result, today the nation faces three major problems: First, as the Midwest Flood of 1993 has shown, people and property remain at risk, not only in the floodplains of the upper Mississippi River Basin, but also throughout the nation.
Many of those at risk do not fully understand the nature and the potential consequences of that risk; nor do they share fully in the fiscal implications of bearing that risk.
Second, only in recent years has the nation come to appreciate fully the significance of the fragile ecosystems of the upper Mississippi River Basin.
Given the tremendous loss of habitat over the last two centuries, many suggest that the nation now face severe ecological consequences.
Third, the division of responsibilities for floodplain management among federal, state, tribal and local governments needs clear definition.
Cur rently, attention to floodplain management varies widely among and within federal, state, tribal and local governments.
The Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee proposes a better way to manage the nation's floodplains.
This report not only describes the nature and extent of the 1993 flooding and government efforts to cope with the event but also presents a blueprint for change.
vii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This blueprint is directed at both the upper Mississippi River Basin and the nation as a whole.
Its foundation is a sharing of responsibilities and accountability among all levels of the government, business, and private citizens.
It provides for a balance among the many competing uses of the rivers and their floodplains; it recognizes, however, that all existing activities in the floodplain simply cannot be discarded as inappropriate.
The model was calibrated and a range of possible floodplain ground covers was used.The analysis suggested that if all the levees (other than urban levees) were absent, the peak stage at St. Louis in 1993 would have been reduced by 2.5 feet, but still more than 17 feet above flood stage and almost 4 feet higher than the previous known maximum level recorded during the 1973 event.
This model scenario assumes the improbable condition of a totally open floodplain covered only with bare soil or short grass cover.
If one assumes existing levees would have constructed to contain all flows, peak stages at St. Louis would have been increased by 2.3 feet.
An independent model commissioned by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed that the overtopping and breaching of two levees downstream from St. Louis at Columbia and Harrisonville, Illinois, reduced peak stage at St. Louis by 1.6 feet.21 This analysis used steady-state model applied to a short stretch of the river and lends support to the UNET findings.
A physical model study conducted at the Waterway Experiment Station (WES) in 1979 by Foster and Allen22 showed that the removal of the trees between the river bank and levee along the middle Mississippi River between St. Louis and Cape Girardeau would lower the stage at St. Louis about 2.5 feet for the 1973 flood, which cor responds with the mathematical (UNET) model results for the fully open, treeless floodplain assumption.
Farther downstream along the middle Mississippi River, the UNET mode predicted that there would have been a sizeable local drop in river levels in the absence of levee under the most conducive flow scenario.
At Chester, Illinois, the stage of the Mississippi River during the 1993 flood would have been approximately 11 feet lower if the levees containing the river were removed.
But the floodplain would have been under water.
The mode predicted that there would be no stage reduction if the entire floodplain were covered dense forest or brush -- a scenario representing a least conducive flow condition.
It is expected that a typical floodplain without levees would contain a mix of uses and associated land covers such as sloughs, side channels, forested and non-forested wetlands and agriculture.
Conclusion: Levees did not cause the 1993 flood.
During large events such as occurred in 1993, levees have minor overall effects on floodstage, but may have significant localized effects.
Erosion and Sedimentation Upland erosion and the sedimentation in downstream areas are major causes of reduced water quality and habitat destruction in most midwestern rivers and streams.
Sedimentation in the backwaters of the upper Mississippi River is the most significant problem in that river.
In recent years, Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin have developed watershed management programs to reduce runoff and erosion.
Land use planning and land stewardship are key nonstructural factors in reducing runoff and downstream flooding.
50 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Significant floodplain erosion and deposition occur red during the 1993 flood, principally on floodplain agricultural lands along the Missouri River.
Preliminary analyses of aerial photography, satellite imagery, and historic Missouri River floodplain maps reveal that more than 90 percent of the areas affected by significant erosion and deposition are associated with breached levees situated in active, highenergy floodplain zones.23 Review of the history of levee failures in this area shows levees have been breached repeatedly at sites of natural river cutoffs or chutes in the past three decades.
Construction of levees across these high energy channels is a risky investment which has required repetitive repair.
In most cases where levees breached, scour holes, locally known as blow holes or blue holes, occur red.
These holes, typically 25 to 50 feet deep, are caused by scouring of alluvial soils underlying the levees and farm fields and are caused when the head of water exceeds the height of a levee or its ability to withstand water pressure, overtopping or breaching the levee and releasing river water through the constricted levee breach with velocities similar to that of a dam break flood wave.
This sudden release of energy scours tremendous volumes of materials creating both new aquatic and terrestrial habitat.
Erosional zones of scour and stripping can extend as far as one mile downstream from the larger breaches (Figure 2.6).
Locally constricted floodflows in breaches through railway embankments and in the vicinity of railroad and highway bridges act in a similar manner.
Comparison of the effects of the 1993 floods on the upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers shows that river reaches in broadly similar physiographic regions may respond very differently to floods.
The annual discharges of the upper Mississippi River are generally comparable to those of the Missouri River, but sediment yields of the Missouri average more than five times those of the Upper Mississippi.
Average slope of the lower Missouri River floodplain (upstream of St. Louis) is about twice that of the middle Mississippi River floodplain (downstream from St. Louis).
Levee breaches along the lower Missouri commonly resulted in high-velocity flows across its relatively nar row and relatively steep (high gradient) floodplain, contributing to extensive deep scour and thick sand deposition across agricultural lands located there.
In contrast, levee breaches along the middle Mississippi produced less intense erosion and sedimentation; impacts were largely limited to passive inundation of large bottomland tracts.
The Pick-Sloan plan authorized by Congress in 1944 called for the creation of a floodway from 3,000 to 5,000 feet wide between levees along the Missouri River from Sioux City, Iowa, to the mouth near St. Louis, Missouri.
The purpose of this floodway was to provide sufficient space for flood waters to pass and reduce potential damage to adjacent farmlands.
For a number of reasons, this plan was never implemented.
The Flood of 1993 demonstrated the need for some form of floodway to provide greater capacity to convey flood flows.
Implementation of any future flood damage reduction plan should recognize that in lieu of a standard setback distance, the floodway should coincide with the natural high-energy zone of the river, which commonly is wide in areas of large meanders and narrow in straighter portion of the river.
Conclusion: Levee location and height are factors in determining erosion and deposition in the floodplain.
There are certain locations where levees should not be constructed.
In these cases set-back levees might allow normal river functions.
Each situation needs to be evaluated on its own merits.
Navigation The Review Committee received numerous suggestions that the flood crest could be lowered significantly by opening navigation dam gates before the ar rival of flood waters.
Hydraulic investigations by the University of Iowa,24 and evaluations of the 1993 flood show that navigation dams cause slight, localized increases in 51 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Figure 2.6 Reach of the Missouri River Bottoms Showing "High Energy" Erosion and Deposition Zones.

Adapted from SAST data, 1994 52 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Flood height just upstream of a dam.
They do not cause increases in flood elevations for the entire Mississippi River System.
In the middle Mississippi (from St. Louis to the confluence with the Ohio River) and on the Missouri River, navigation channels have no locks and dams, and the dikes and revetments which are in place cause little or no restriction to flow. sloughs and wooded islands can be found.
In the lower end, immediately above each dam, wide open water lake-like areas occur (Figure 2.2).
While impoundment of the upper Mississippi River for slackwater navigation created a variety of backwater and side-channel habitats, these dams also slowed river currents, starting the ir reversible process of sedimentation.
Many backwater habitats are filling with sediments from the erosion of upland agricultural and developed lands.
Rock dikes and channel maintenance dredging also contribute to the problem.
Mississippi River backwaters shill provide critical fish production and nursery habitats, but may be lost to sedimentation and eutrophication within 60 yrs.25 Downstream from its confluence with the Missouri River, the upper Mississippi River takes on a very different character, similar to that of the Missouri (see Missouri River habitat description).
Forth-six species of Mississippi River fish, virtually all of which have been affected by flood damage reduction measures and navigation, are listed by basin states as rare, threatened, endangered, or a species of special concern.26 Missouri River.
Parts of the Missouri River were well known as a braided river with swift, muddy flows.
The historic floodplain was a ribbon of islands, chutes, oxbow lakes, backwaters, marshes, grasslands, and forests.
Sandbars and wooded islands dotted the channel.
Between 1879 and 1954, human actions and natural changes shortened the river by 45.6 miles, reduced river surface area by over 50,000 acres, reduced the number of islands from 161 (24,419 acres) to 18 (419 acres), and converted nearly 67,000 acres of river habitat from public to private ownership, most to agriculture.27 Nearly one-third of the Missouri River has been impounded, another one-third channelized, and the hydrologic cycle, including temporal flow volume and sediment transport, has been altered on the remainder.
The Missouri River formerly had peak run-off during two periods, March-April and June.
Prior to 1954 flushing flows, known as dominant discharge, occur red every 1.5 years.
The river was in a state of equilibrium; net sediment entering a reach replaced an equal amount leaving allowing for ample habitat Conclusion: Navigation dams and locks did not cause an increase in the stage heights of the 1993 flood.
Habitat Loss Fish and wildlife resources in the upper Mississippi River Basin have been significantly affected by the loss of wetlands and other ter restrial and aquatic habitats due to construction for navigation and flood damage reduction structures.
Upper Mississippi River.
The upper Mississippi River was originally a free-flowing, alluvial riverine environment with associated riparian habitats.
Construction of navigation control structures (rock dikes) and installation of the slackwater navigation dams have created habitat types substantially different from those found in a free-flowing alluvial river.
Habitat types within the upper Mississippi River slackwater navigation pools are created by coincident physical, water quality, and botanical characteristics.
River position, depth, water-surface area, stage and discharge, vegetation, riverbottom types, water quality, and the superimposed structural elements within the river define the various habitats.
Three distinct habitat zones occur in the slackwater navigation pools.
The upper end of each pool is like the original river although subject to exaggerated water level fluctuations from the upstream dam releases.
March development is limited.
In the middle portion of the pools, downstream impoundment backs water up and over the islands and old hay meadows, creating large areas of shallow water.
This section has the best marsh development, and some deep 53 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Figure 2.7 Changes in Channel Morphology Following the Addition of Navigation Dikes, Indian Cave Bend, Missouri River, North of Rulo, Nebraska.

Loss of sediment load let to channel degradation which contributed to the loss of off-channel habitat and further severed the river from its floodplain.
Since the early 1950s the Missouri River has thus been deprived of a floodplain in most reaches.
Water temperature, photoperiod, and run-off cues have been altered by reservoir releases for navigation and other purposes.28" Changes in basin and floodplain physiography and channel mor phology have reduced commercial fish harvest by more than 80 percent and are implicated in the demise of native species.
The Missouri River's natural riparian ecosystem has been nearly eliminated and presently consists of a discontinuous, single row of trees.
Missouri River floodplain forest coverage decreased from 76 percent in 1826 to 13 percent in 1972, while cultivated lands increased from 18 percent to 83 percent.
Figure 2.8 Missouri River Reservoirs and Navigation System.
55 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Thirty-four species of Missouri River Basin stream fish are listed by basin states as rare, threatened, endangered, or as species of special concern.29 The pallid sturgeon, piping plover, least tern, and bald eagle are all native Missouri River species listed as endangered by the U. S. Fish 
33 Burbot have been nearly extir pated, sauger have been greatly reduced, and blue catfish are rare.
The Master Water Control Manual for the six Missouri River main stem reservoirs is cur rently under review by the USACE.
Decisions made with regard to this manual are important to the future of the Missouri River ecosystem.
For example reservoir water releases could be adjusted to simulate natural hydrographs and, in combination with riparian land acquisition, be used to restore many of the river's natural functions including lowlevel flooding of riparian lands.
Illinois River.
Aquatic and ter restrial habitats of the Illinois River Valley have suffered a series of cataclysmic events since 1900: (1) permanent rise in water level from water diverted from Lake Michigan, (2) the draining of more than half of the 400,000 acre floodplain through the construction of levees and pumping stations, (3) an upsurge in untreated urban and industrial pollution during the 1920s, (4) the creation of a 9 ft. channel and its attendant navigation dams in the 1930s, and (5) an acceleration in sedimentation rates following World War II, apparently resulting from an increase in the amount of open row crops grown within the basin.34 As an example, in 1908, a 200-mile reach of the Illinois River produced 10% of the total U. S. catch of freshwater fish (employing 2,000 commercial fishermen and yielding 24 million lbs. of fish annually).
Commercial fish yield totaled about 178 lbs/ac of permenent water, but by the 1950s yield had dropped to 38 lbs/ac and by the 1970s to 4 lbs/ac, totaling 0.32% of the total U.S. freshwater harvest.
35 Conclusion: Alteration of Mississippi, Illinois and Missouri Rivers and floodplains has resulted in significant changes or losses of habitat.
The disruption of natural ecosystems has caused the destruction of many native species populations and has caused an increasing number to be listed as threatened or endangered.

The UNET Model is a computer program that solves unsteady state flow equations to describe floodflow conditions.
Unsteady state means that the depth of flow changes with both distance along the channel and with time .
The model uses a network approach to solving the unsteady state flow relationships.
UNET is a 1-dimensional model and assumes that the calculated velocity at a cross-section exists across the entire river.
The area behind levees are modeled as storage cells.
After calibration using flow data obser ved in the 1993, 1986, and 1973 flows with pre-flood conditions of levee development in the floodplain, the model analyzed the water surface profiles that would result from those same flood flows assuming levees were absent.
Under such a scenario, land use in most areas would be different than presently exists as would ground cover types.
Because the hydraulic roughness (resistance to flow) of the floodplain cross-section must be represented in the model, a range of possible ground cover types was used, from bare soil or shor t grass to dense forest or dense brush.
A floodplain absent of levees would likely have a mix of ground cover types ranging between and including these extremes.

58 Chapter 3 FUTURE FLOOD POTENTIAL After the 1965 flood, they told us this wouldn't happen again for another 100 years.
Midwestern mayor July 1993 This quote illustrates the lack of understanding by many individuals concerning flood potential.
Implementation also will reduce the environmental, social, and economic burdens imposed by cur rent conditions on both public and private sectors.SHARING THE CHALLENGE - FEDERAL, STATE, TRIBAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESSES, CITIZENS Since passage of the Flood Control Act of 1936, the federal government has dominated the nation's flood damage reduction efforts and as a result, the nation's floodplain management activity.
Structural programs were deemed important and were also the principal sources of funds for any efforts to stem the rising tide of flood losses.
In recent years, the federal government has begun to support nonstructural approaches.
Many states, tribes, and local governments have developed and car ried out floodplain management efforts that both reduced flood damages and enhanced the natural functions of floodplains.
In carrying out these programs, however, they have been hampered by uncoordinated and conflicting federal programs, policies, regulations and guidelines that have hindered efficient floodplain management.
Some state and local governments have not been as active in floodplain management.
With the federal government assuming the dominant role and funding most ecosystem restoration, flood damage reduction, and flood recovery activities, the incentive has been limited for many state, tribal and local governments, businesses, and private citizens to share responsibility for making wise decisions concerning floodplain activity.
Now is the time to: Share responsibility and accountability for accomplishing floodplain management among all levels government and with all citizens of the nation.
The federal government cannot go it alone nor should it take a dominant role in the process.
Establish, as goals for the future, the reduction of the vulnerability of the nation to the dangers and damages that result from floods and the concurrent and integrated preservation and enhancement of the natural resources and functions of floodplains.
Such an approach seeks to avoid unwise use of the floodplain, to minimize vulnerability when floodplains must be used, and to mitigate damages when they do occur.
Organize federal programs to provide the support and the tools necessary for all levels of government to carry out and participate in effective floodplain management.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ COMMITTEE FINDINGS: In conducting the review, the Committee divided its findings into two areas; the Midwest Flood of 1993, and Federal, State, Tribal, and Local Floodplain Management.
The Midwest Flood of 1993 In reviewing the Midwest Flood of 1993, the Committee found that: hydrometeorological event unprecedented in recent times.
It was caused by excessive rainfall that occur red throughout a significant section of the upper Mississippi River Basin.
The damaging impacts of this rainfall and Ã¯Â¿Â½ viii The Midwest Flood of 1993 was a EXECUTIVE SUMMARY related runoff were felt both in upland areas and in the floodplains.
Pre-flood rainfall saturated the ground and swelled tributary rivers.
Subsequent rains quickly filled surface areas, forcing runoff into the lower lands and creating flood conditions.
The recur rence interval of the flood ranged from less than 100 years at many locations to near 500 years on segments of the Mississippi River from Keithsburg, Illinois, to above St. Louis, Missouri, and on segments of the Missouri River from Rulo, Nebraska, to above Hermann, Missouri.
At 45 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging stations, the flow levels exceeded the 100-year mark.
The duration of the flood added to its significance.
Many areas were under water for months.
Rainfall and floods like the 1993 event will continue to occur.
Floods are natural repetitive phenomena.
Considering the nation's short history of hydrologic recordkeeping as well as the limited knowledge of long-term weather patterns, flood recurrence intervals are difficult to predict.
Activities in the floodplain, even with levee protection, continue to remain at risk.
The loss of the wetlands and upland cover and the modification of the landscape throughout the basin over the last century and a half significantly increased runoff.
Most losses occurred prior to 1930, but some are related to more recent drainage, flood damage reduction, and navigation development.
Although upland watershed treatment and restoration of upland and bottomland wetlands can reduce flood stages in more frequent floods (25 years and less) it is questionable whether they would have significantly altered the 1993 conditions.
Human activity throughout the basin has caused significant loss of habitat and ecosystem diversity.
Flood damage reduction and navigation works and land uses practices have altered bottomland habitat adversely.
The costs to the nation from the flood were extensive.
Thirty-eight deaths can be attributed directly to the flood and estimates of fiscal damages range from $12 billion to 16 billion.
Agriculture accounted for over half of the damages.
More than 70 percent of the crop disaster assistance payments were made to counties in upland areas where ground saturation prevented planting or killed the crop.
Nearly 50 percent of the approximately 100,000 homes damaged, suffered losses due to groundwater or sewer backup as opposed to riverine flooding.
Flood response and recovery operations cost the nation more than $6 billion.
In addition many costs can not yet be quantified.
Impacts on businesses in out of the basin have not been calculated.
Tax losses to governments are unknown.
The impacts of the flood on the population's physical and mental well-being are just being identified and are of concern.
Flood damage reduction projects and floodplain management programs, where implemented, worked essentially as designed and significantly reduced the damages to population centers, agriculture, and industry.
It is estimated that reservoirs and levees built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), prevented more than $19 billion in potential damages.
Large areas of Kansas City and St. Louis were spared the ravages of flood, although several suburbs suffered heavy damages.
Watershed projects built by the Soil Conservation Service saved an estimated additional $400 million.
Land use controls required by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and state floodplain management programs reduced the number of structures at risk throughout the basin.
Many locally constructed levees breached and/or overtopped.
Frequently, these events resulted in considerable damage to the land behind the levees through scour and deposition.
Flooding during the 1993 event would have covered much of the floodplains of the main stem lower Missouri and upper Mississippi rivers whether or not levees were there.
Levees can cause problems in some critical reaches by backing water up on other levees or lowlands.
Locks and dams and other navigation related structures did not raise flood heights.
For more frequent floods -- less flow -- navigation dikes may cause some minor increase in flood heights.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ ix EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Federal, State, Tribal and Local Floodplain Management The Review Committee examined the structure of cur rent federal programs, relationships among federal, state, tribal and local governments, the performance of various programs during and after the flood, and the after action reports stemming from these activities.
The Review Committee reached the following conclusions: The division of responsibilities floodplain management activities among and between federal, state, tribal, and local governments needs to be clearly defined.
Within the federal system, water resources activities in general flood and floodplain management in particular need better coordination.
State and local governments must have a fiscal stake in floodplain management; without this stake, few incentives exist for them to be fully involved in floodplain management.
State governments must assist local governments in dealing with federal programs.
The federal government must set the example in floodplain management activities.
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) needs improvement.
Penetration of flood insurance into the target market -- floodplain occupants -- is very low, 20-30 percent.
Communities choosing not to participate in the NFIP continue to receive substantial disaster assistance.
Provision of major federal disaster assistance to those without insurance creates a perception with many floodplain residents that purchase of flood insurance is not a worthwhile investment.
The mapping program is underfunded and needs greater accuracy and coverage.
Some requirements within the program that vary from disaster to disaster need stabilization.
The principal federal water resources planning document, Principles and Guidelines, is outdated and does not reflect a balance among the economic, social, and environmental goals of the nation.
This lack of balance is exacerbated by a present inability to quantify, in monetary terms, some environmental and social impacts.
As result, these impacts are frequently understated or omitted.
Many critics of Principles and Guidelines see it as biased against nonstructural approaches.
Existing federal programs designed to protect and enhance the floodplain and watershed environment are not as effective as they should be.
They lack support, flexibility and funding, and are not well coordinated.
As a result, progress in habitat improvement is slow.
Federal pre-disaster, response, recovery and mitigation programs need streamlining but are making marked progress.
The nation clearly recognized the aggressive and caring response of the government to the needs of flood victims, but coordination problems that developed need to be addressed.
Buyouts of floodprone homes and damaged lands make considerable inroads in reducing future flood losses.
The nation needs a coordinated strategy for effective management of the water resources of the upper Mississippi River Basin.
Responsibility for integrated navigation, flood damage reduction and ecosystem management is divided among several federal programs.
The current flood damage reduction system in the upper Mississippi River Basin represents a loose aggregation of federal, local, and individual levees and reservoirs.
This aggregation does not ensure the desired reduction in the vulnerability of floodplain activities to damages.
Many levees are poorly sited and will fail again in the future.
Without change in current federal programs, source of these levees will remain eligible for post-disaster support.
Levee restoration programs need greater flexibility to provide for concurrent environmental restoration.
The nation is not using science and technology to full advantage in gathering and disseminating critical water resources management information.
Opportunities exist to provide information needed to better plan the use of the floodplain and to operate during crisis conditions.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ x EXECUTIVE SUMMARY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS The Review Committee developed recommendations in consonance with the proposed goals: To ensure that the floodplain management effort is organized for success, the President should: Propose enactment of a Floodplain Management Act which establishes a national model for floodplain management, clearly delineates federal, state, tribal, and local responsibilities, provides fiscal support for state and local floodplain management activities, and recognizes states as the nation's principal floodplain managers; Issue a revised Executive Order clearly defining the responsibility of federal agencies to exercise sound judgement in floodplain activities; and Activate the Water Resources Council to coordinate federal and federal-state-tribal activities in water resources; as appropriate, reestablish basin commissions to provide a forum for federal-statetribal coordination on regional issues.
To focus attention on comprehensive evaluation of all federal water project and program effects, the President should immediately establish environmental quality and national economic development as co-equal objectives of planning conducted under the Principles and Guidelines.
Principles and Guidelines should be revised to accommodate the new objectives and to ensure full consideration of nonstructural alternatives.
To enhance coordination of project development, to address multiple objective planning, and to increase customer service, the Administration should support collaborative efforts among federal agencies and across state, tribal, and local governments.
To ensure continuing state, tribal and local interest in floodplain management success, the Administration should provide for federal, state, tribal, and/or local cost-sharing in pre-disaster, recovery, response, and mitigation activities.
To provide for coordination of the multiple federal programs dealing with watershed management, the Administration should establish an Interagency Task Force to develop a coordination strategy to guide these actions.
To take full advantage of existing federal programs which enhance the floodplain environment and provide for natural storage in bottomlands and uplands, the Administration should: Seek legislative authority to increase post-disaster flexibility in the execution of the land acquisition programs; Increase environmental attention in federal operation and maintenance and disaster recovery activities; Better coordinate the environmentally-related land interest acquisition activities of the federal government; and Fund, through existing authorities, programmatic acquisition of needed lands from willing sellers.
To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program, the Administration should: Take vigorous steps to improve the marketing of flood insurance, enforce lender compliance rules, and seek state support of insurance marketing; Reduce the amount of post-disaster support to those who were eligible to buy insurance but did not to that level needed to provide for immediate health, safety, and welfare; provide a safety net for low income flood victims who were unable to afford flood insurance; Reduce repetitive loss outlays by adding a surcharge to flood insurance policies following each claim under a policy, providing for mitigation insurance riders, and supporting other mitigation activities; Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ xi EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Require those who are behind levees that provide protection against less than the standard project flood discharge to purchase actuarially based insurance; Increase the waiting period for activation of flood insurance policies from 5 to 15 days to avoid purchases when flooding is imminent; Leverage technology to improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of flood insurance maps; support map development by levies on the policy base and from appropriated funds because the general taxpayer benefits from this program; and Provide for the purchase of mitigation insurance to cover the cost of elevating, demolishing, or relocating substantially damaged buildings.
To reduce the vulnerability to flood damages of those in the floodplain, the Administration should: Give full consideration to all possible alternatives for vulnerability reduction, including permanent evacuation of floodprone areas, flood warning, floodproofing of structures remaining in the floodplain, creation of additional natural and artificial storage, and adequately sized and maintained levees and other structures; Adopt flood damage reduction guidelines based on a revised Principles and Guidelines which would give full weight to social, economic, and environmental values and assure that all vulnerability reduction alternatives are given equal consideration; and Where appropriate, reduce the vulnerability of population centers and critical infrastructure to the standard project flood discharge through use of floodplain management activities and programs.
To ensure that existing federally constructed water resources projects continue to meet their intended purposes and are reflective of current national social and environmental goals, the Administration should require periodic review of completed projects.
To provide for efficiency in operations and for consistency of standards, the Administration should assign principal responsibility for repair, rehabilitation, and construction of levees under federal programs to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
To ensure the integrity of levee and the environmental and hydraulic efficiencies of the floodplain, states and tribes should ensure proper siting, construction, and maintenance of non-federal levees.
To capitalize on the successes in federal, state, tribal, and local pre-disaster, response, recovery, and mitigation efforts during and following the 1993 flood and to Streamline future efforts, the Administration should: Through the NFIP Community Rating System encourage states and communities to develop and implement floodplain management and hazard mitigation plans; Provide funding for programmatic buyouts of Structures at risk in the floodplain; Provide states the option of receiving Section 404 Hazard Mitigation Grants as block grants; Assign the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency responsibility for integrating federal disaster response and recovery operations; and Encourage federal agencies to use non-disaster funding to support hazard mitigation activities on a routine basis.
To provide integrated, hydrologic, hydraulic, and ecosystems management of the upper Mississippi River basin, the Administration should: Establish upper Mississippi River Basin and Missouri River Basin commissions to deal with basin-level program coordination; Assign responsibility, in consultation with the Congress, to the Mississippi River Commission (MRC), for integrated management of flood damage reduction, ecosystem management, and navigation on the upper Mississippi River and Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ xii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY tributaries; expand MRC membership to include representation from the Department of the Interior; assign MRC responsibility for development of a plan to provide long-term control an maintenance of sound federally built and federally supported levees along the main stems of Mississippi and Missouri rivers; this support would be contingent on meeting appropriate engineering, environmental, and social standards.
Seek authorization from the Congress to establish an Upper Mississippi River and Tributaries project for management of the federal flood damage reduction and navigation activities in the upper Mississippi River Basin; Establish the upper Mississippi River Basin as an additional national cross-agency Ecosystem Management Demonstration Project; and Charge the Department of the Interior with conducting an ecosystem needs analysis of the upper Mississippi River Basin.
To provide timely gathering and dissemination of the critical water resources information needed for floodplain management and disaster operations, the Administration should: Establish an information clearing house at USGS to provide federal agencies and state and local activities the information already gathered by the federal government during and following the 1993 flood and to build on the pioneering nature of this effort; and Exploit science and technology to support monitoring, analysis, modeling, and the development of decision support systems and geographic information systems for floodplain activities.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ STRUCTURE OF THE REVIEW Throughout the spring, summer, and fall of 1993, the people of the United States were faced each night with pictures of the devastation brought on the midwestern United States by the Great Flood of 1993.
For nearly six decades, the nation had labored to reduce the impacts of floods, yet the toll in lives lost, homes damaged, and property destroyed was enormous.
Why had this happened? What caused the flood? Had human intervention over time exacerbated the situation? What should the nation be doing to prevent a repetition? To answer these questions, the Administration Floodplain Management Task Force, part of the Administration Flood Recovery Task Force headed by Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy, established the Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee, a group of 31 professionals assigned to federal agencies with responsibilities in the water resources arena.
The Review Committee conducted its activity from January through June 1994 in Washington and throughout the Midwest.
Working through the offices of the governors of the nine flood-affected states, the Review Committee met with state and local officials and visited over 60 locations.
The Review Committee also made extensive contacts with federal agencies, interest groups, members of Congress and their staffs and numerous private citizens who expressed an interest in the flood.
A part of the Review Committee, the Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team, chartered in November 1993 by the White House, conducted its activities at the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where it developed a major database of flood and basin information.
The report of the Review Committee includes an action plan delineating proposed responsibilities and timelines for execution of the recommendations, a fiscal impact statement, and the preliminary report of the Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team. xiii xiv CONTENTS THANKS . . . . . . . . . . . . .

.77 .136 .146 .182 xviii INTRODUCTION The time has come to face the fact that this Nation can no longer afford the high costs of natural disaster.
We can no longer afford the economic costs to the American taxpayer, nor can we afford the social costs to our communities and individuals.
James L. Witt Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency Testimony before Congress, October 27, 1993 Throughout the spring, summer, and fall of 1993, the people of the United State were faced with pictures of the devastation wrought on the Midwest by what became know as "The Great Flood of 1993."
For nearly six decades, the nation had labored to reduce the impacts of floods, yet within a few months tens of thousands of homes were damaged, and the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans disrupted.
Acre upon acre of some of the nation's richest farmland lay fallow.
Why did this happen? What caused the flood? Did human intervention over the years exacerbate the situation? What should the nation be doing to prevent a repetition of the 1993 event? The Administration Floodplain Management Task Force, a part of the Clinton Administration's flood Recovery Task Force, headed by Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy, established the Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee to seek answers to these questions and to make recommendations.
The charter of the Review Committee (see Appendix A) assigns it the mission to: Delineate the major causes and consequences of the 1993 flooding; Evaluate the performance of existing floodplain management and related watershed management programs; and Make recommendations to the Task force on changes in current policies, programs, and activities of the federal government that would most effectively achieve risk reduction, economic efficiency, and environmental enhancement in the floodplain and related watersheds.
The Review Committee consisted of federal engineers and physical, social, and biological scientists who contributed technical and institutional knowledge in the fields of flood damage-reduction and river basin ecosystem management.
Of the 31 -member Review Committee, 15 members were located in Washington, D.C., and 16 formed the Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team (SAST), which operated from the Earth Resource Observation System (EROS) center at Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
The SAST was chartered by the White House in November 1993 "to provide scientific advice and assistance to officials responsible for making decisions with respect to flood recovery in the upper Mississippi River Basin."
It was incor porated into the Review Committee in January 1994 to serve as its research arm for scientific analysis.
For a full listing of Review Committee members and their parent agencies, see Appendix B.
The Review Committee began its work in January 1994, focusing on federal agency briefings and consultations with other levels of government to gain a better understanding of the complex intergovernmental system of Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ xix INTRODUCTION WHAT IS A FLOODPLAIN? Floodplains are the relatively low and periodically inundated areas adjacent to rivers, lakes, and oceans.
Floodplain lands and adjacent waters combine to form a complex, dynamic physical and biological system that supports a multitude of water resources, living resources, water filtering processes, a wide variety of habitats for flora and fauna, places for recreation and scientific study, and historic and archeological sites.
They are also the locus of a variety of human activities, including commerce, agriculture, residence, and infrastructure.
Estimates of the extent of the nation's floodplains vary according to the areas measured.
In 1977 the U.S. Water Resources Council estimated that floodplains comprise about 7 percent, or 178.8 million acres of the total area of the United States and its territories.
During the 1993 flood, floodplains along the upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers became part of the rivers when they were inundated by river stages exceeding channel capacity or the design elevations of flood-control levees or when the levees failed or overtopped.
Adapted, in part, from the draft 1994 Unified National Program for Floodplain Management responsibilities and decision making in floodplain management.
This initial effort was followed by discussions in the nine Midwest states most affected by the flood.
Review Committee members met with the governors and their representatives, state flood recovery and mitigation task forces, staffs or relevant congressional committees, staffs of congressional members from the flood states, and interest groups at the national, regional, and local level.
In March the Review Committee shifted its focus to outreach visits in the Midwest communities and areas affected by the flood.
During this phase of review, the Review Committee visited over 60 communities where county, city, and other local officials and citizens assembled to provide information and insights.
The Review committee asked those contacted to share their candid opinions about the best use of flood hazard areas, their visions of the future, and how that vision was changed by the 1993 flood.
They were asked about hazard mitigation, floodplain management, and the emergency response plans of the flood-affected communities, with particular regard to whether such plans were useful during or after the flood.
All were asked to critique the strengths and weaknesses of federal programs and policies as presently structured, and to discuss what federal and state roles should be in long-term management of floodplains.
Throughout the review process, a steady stream of letters ar rived from organizations, interest groups, state and local officials, and from individuals offering information, personal viewpoints, and advice, all of which the Review Committee greatly appreciated.
Following visits to the Midwest, the Review Committee formulated an ar ray of floodplain management options, briefs of which were presented to the Administration Floodplain Management Task force, congressional interests, federal agencies, state officials, and interest groups.
Meetings to review the options were held in Washington, D.C.; Kansas City, Missouri; Springfield, Illinois; and Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Review Committee then developed its recommendations.
xx INTRODUCTION teams worked around the clock, month after month, to Mitigate damages and suffering.
Those who were recipients of this assistance will never forget this demonstration of true caring.
While the Review Committee report will not address all of these successes, they should not be forgotten.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT Floodplain management is a decision making process whose goal is to achieve appropriate use of the nation's floodplains.
Appropriate use is any activity or set of activities compatible with the risk to natural resources (natural and beneficial functions of floodplains) and human resources (life and property).
The history of the nation's floodplain activity is as old as the nation itself and is well chronicled in An Assessment Report: Floodplain Management in the United States, prepared in 1992 for the Federal Interagency Floodplain Management Task Force SHARING THE CHALLENGE Today the nation faces three major problems in floodplain management: As the Midwest Flood of 1993 has shown, people and property remain at risk, not only in the floodplains of the upper Mississippi River Basin but also throughout the nation.
Many of those at risk neither fully understand the nature and the potential consequences of that risk nor share fully in the fiscal implications of bearing that risk.
Over the last thirty years, average annual riverine flood damages have exceeded $2 billion.
Over the last ten, they have been over $3 billion.
Between 1988 and 1992, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has expended nearly $200 million each year in flood recovery activities.1 Only in recent years has the nation come to appreciate fully the significance of the fragile ecosystems of the upper Mississippi River Basin.
Given the tremendous loss of habitat over the last two centuries, many suggest that we now face severe ecological consequences.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ GOOD NEWS Although the flood of 1993 ultimately caused major damages throughout the upper Mississippi river basin, many elements of structural and nonstructural flood damage reduction systems put in place by federal, state, and local governments over the years did work and prevented billions of dollars in damages.
During the flood the outreach from all over the country and the world to those suffering the effects of the flooding was most impressive.
Thousands filled and stacked sandbags to hold weakening levees; others worked day after day to help clean the homes and businesses of people they had never met.
Dry communities adopted those in need.
Contributions to assist flood victims poured in from people in many nations.
Federal, state, and local disaster Ã¯Â¿Â½ A lot of great things have been done that prevented damages and mitigated the damages that did occur... we can't lose sight of this.
Terry Brandstad Governor Of Iowa February 16, 1994 xxi INTRODUCTION The division of responsibilities for floodplain management among federal, state, tribal, and local governments is not clearly defined.
As a result, attention to floodplain management varies widely among and within federal, state, tribal, and local governments.
This report provides the Review Committee's findings and recommendations for action.
Part I (Chapters 1-3) discusses the flood event and its impacts as well as the effects of human intervention, over time, on the nature of this flood.
It also provides insights into the potential for recurrence of the event.
Part II (Chapters 4-9) provides a blueprint for the future -- a consensus view of floodplain management for the 21st century.
Part III addresses the residual problems with floodplain management in the upper Mississippi River Basin.
Part IV (Chapters 11-15) highlights needs in the fields of research, science, and technology; discusses the economic impacts of the report's findings and recommendations; converts the general actions proposed in Chapters 5 to 11 into specific tasks for accomplishment and summarizes the report.
The report contains conclusions, actions, and recommendations.
Conclusions represent the Committee's evaluation of its research or analysis related to the Flood of 1993 and its consequences.
The Review Committee identified specific approaches required to move forward in floodplain management as actions.
Actions may involve resource commitments beyond an agency's baseline posture.
Recommendations address problems that the Review Committee believes merit attention; however, the solutions to these problems can be accomplished within agency resources, existing programs, or cooperative efforts.
The thesis of this report is straightforward.
The tools to car ry out effective floodplain management exist today but need improvement.
The goals are clear.
It is now time to organize a national effort to conduct effective and efficient floodplain management.
It is time to share responsibility and accountability for accomplishing floodplain management among all levels of government and with the citizens of the nation.
Working together, the nation's public and private sectors can accomplish the mission.
A MESSAGE FROM ELIZABETH Dear General Galloway: My name is Elizabeth Darabcsek.
I am eleven years old and in the 5th grade at Christ Prince of Peace School.
I read your article in the newspaper and was interested.
I thought I could help.
I did a science fair project on floods.
I tested levees, back to nature and something I made up, it was a small levee by the river and a larger one a little farther back.
The little one held most of the water but not all.
The water that was not held back from the small levee would then stay in the space between the big and little levee.
The land between the two levees could be used as farm land or other things that could not be badly damaged by a big flood.
The damaged levee could be used as the levee in the front (the smaller levee).
Therefore, we would only have to build one new levee.
This information may not help you, but I wanted you to know that I am trying to help protect our cities too.
Sincerely, Elizabeth Darabcsek P.S.
Just to tell you, I won first place for my project out of the whole 5th grade.

Each time I have come away saddened by the enormous loss.
I have never seen such devastation.
On the other hand, I have never witnessed such tremendous courage as that displayed by individuals who are beginning to rebuild their lives.
Mike Espy Secretary of Agriculture Chair, Flood Recovery Task Force November 10, 1993 Floods are a function of the location, intensity, volume, and duration of rainfall and snowmelt.
Other factors include the characteristics of a region's topography, its land-cover conditions, and the capacity of its floodplain to convey or store water.
In 1993 a singular combination of these factors resulted in one of the most costly flood disasters in U.S. history.
This chapter surveys the damages prevented and the record damages reported in the 1993 flooding of the upper Mississippi River Basin.
It also addresses the response and recovery costs for affected towns, cities, and states and for the nation.
THE BASIN The upper Mississippi River Basin is physiographically, ecologically, and climatologically diverse.
Physiographically it ranges from the Rocky Mountains to the Ozark Plateau to the Glaciated Plains and central lowlands.
Climatologically it ranges from the semi-arid basins and plains of eastern Colorado and Wyoming to the humid-temperate margins of the Great lakes.
Geographic analysis divides this region into 70 ter rain units defined by distinct combinations of physical, geologic, soil, ecological, climate, and land-use characteristics.
Each unit is subject to different combinations and intensities of hydrologic and geomor phic processes.
Individual areas respond differently to storm events and land treatments.
The Mississippi River rises at the outlet of Lake Itasca in the lake and forest country of north-central Minnesota and empties into the Gulf of Mexico in the marshy delta just below Head-of-Passes, Louisiana.
Over its journey of 2,320 miles, the Mississippi River falls 1,463 feet and drains 1.25 million square miles (sq. mi.) or 41 percent of the land area of the 48 contiguous United States.
That portion of the Mississippi River drainage lying above its confluence with the Ohio River and refer red to as the upper Mississippi River Basin is the focus of this report.
It is in this basin where the deluge of rain and consequent record flooding occur red during the spring, summer and fall of 1993.
Draining all or part of 13 states, the upper Mississippi River Basin encompasses approximately 714,000 square miles.
It comprises 57 percent of the total Mississippi River Basin and 23 percent of the area in the contiguous United States.
From its source at Lake Itaska, Minnesota, to its confluence with Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois, the Mississippi River courses a distance of 1,366 miles.
Its principal tributary is the Missouri River, which drains 529,300 sq. mi. above its mouth at St Louis, Missouri, including 9700 sq. mi. in Canada.
3 THE FLOOD OF 1993 UPPER, LOWER, MIDDLE? Lending confusion to a discussion of the Mississippi River and its drainage basin is the fact that hydrologists divide the basin, including tributary basins, into two parts: the upper and the lower; and the river into three reaches -- the upper, middle, and lower.
Division between the upper basin and lower basin is at Cairo (above the mouth of the Ohio River).
For the Mississippi River itself, the reach upstream from St. Louis is called the upper Mississippi River (upper Miss.), the reach between St. Louis and Cairo is the middle Mississippi River (middle Miss.), and the reach downstream from Cairo is called the lower Mississippi River (lower Miss.).
Other major tributaries include the Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Des Moines, and Illinois rivers, all of which drain watersheds greater than 10,000 sq. mi. in area (Figure 1.1).
The Missouri River, which drains all or part of ten states and 74 percent of the upper Mississippi River Basin, contributes only 42 percent of the long-term average annual flow of the Mississippi River at St. Louis.
The Missouri River does contribute the most sediment in the upper Mississippi River Basin.
Hydrologically the Missouri River Basin is divided into upper and lower portions with demarcation at Sioux City, Iowa.
The upper and lower basins contain 314,600 sq. mi. and 214,700 sq. mi. respectively.
Runoff from the upper basin is controlled in great measure by regulation of six large dam and reservoir projects on the main stem Missouri River operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
The drainage area (279,400 sq. mi.) above Gavins Point Dam, the dam furthest downstream, encompasses about 90 percent of the upper Missouri River Basin and over 50 percent of the total Missouri River Basin area.
The amount of water that runs off the upper basin annually averages 24.6 million acrefeet.1 populations continued to grow, creating an increased demand for forest lumber resources and agricultural products.
Most early urban settlements were located on or near rivers to be close to water supplies and transportation arteries.
By the late 1800s, settlers had cleared and drained many wetlands for agriculture and planted higher floodplain areas to crops.2 VOLUMES OF WATER When quantifying large volumes of water, a measuring unit as small as a gallon results in numbers in the billions or trillions and makes perception difficult.
Water engineers and scientists have adopted a larger unit and, therefore, employ smaller, somewhat more readily envisioned numbers.
That unit is the acre-foot and represents the volume of water standing one foot deep over an area of one acre.
Thus the mean annual volume of water that runs off the upper Missouri River Basin can be expressed as 25 million acre-feet rather than 8,145,720,000,000 gallons.
History of Development The upper Mississippi River valley was settled by European immigrants during the 18th and 19th centuries.
By 1824 early steamboat travel and commerce created a demand for navigation improvements.
Urban and rural 4 THE FLOOD OF 1993 Figure 1.1 Upper Mississippi River Basin Some areas were protected with agricultural levees.
Early development of the basin was closely tied to the river system, and many navigation and local flood-control efforts were installed without federal assistance.
By the early 1900s, the basin's fisheries resources were declining as a result of various environmental perturbations, sedimentation, pollution, and water-leverl fluctuations caursed by deforestation and agricultural development.
Between 1930 and 1950, extensive modification continued on tmain rivers, while upland areas continued to be drained for agricultural purposes.
Major urban areas such as St. Louis, Kansas City, and Minneapolis/St.
Paul developed as business and industry centers.
The Midwest Flood of 1993, one of the most costly flood events in this nation's history, flooded over 6.6 million acres in the 419 counties in the study area.3 The damages experienced reflected the land-use and settlement patterns within and adjacent to the floodplain.
The floodplains 5 THE FLOOD OF 1993 along the main stem Mississippi and Missouri rivers and the major tributaries that were inundated generally are used for agriculture, and most areas are sparsely populated.
Throughout most of the area, river towns are protected by urban levees, or they are located primarily on a bluff.
Floodwaters thus inundated neighborhoods rather than entire communities.
Residences, businesses, and industries did receive extensive damages in bottomland areas and along tributaries near Kansas and St. Louis.
Development in these urban areas, however, is largely in the uplands or protected by urban levees that provided flood protection.
As a point of comparison, significantly fewer people were impacted by the Midwest Flood of 1993 than were impacted by the 1927 flood on the lower Mississippi River.
Floodplain land-use patterns.
Above Rock Island, Illinois, the Mississippi River valley is relatively nar row and bottomlands are filled to a large extend by navigation pools -- the slack water pools that form behind navigation dams.
Most of the remaining floodplain in this area is contained in wildlife refuges with limited agriculture.
Along this reach of the river are scattered towns settled during the steamboat era that have developed as market centers and service areas for agricultural hinterlands.
Industries were established in many of these towns to take advantage of river navigation and the railroads that later followed the river valleys.
Such towns generally have been protected b urban levees or are largely out of the floodplain.
Below Rock Island the valley widens out to as much as six miles.
The extensive bottomlands in these areas are protected by agricultural levees and used for crops.
The leveed areas include farmsteads and a few small farm communities entirely within the floodplain.
Missouri River bottomlands, used predominantly for agriculture, are protected to varying degrees by levees.
On the fringes of the bottomlands are small farm communities.
In the adjoining uplands a number of larger communities are located on the bluffs above the valley.
Developed floodplains with larger urban areas such as Omaha/Council Bluffs, Kansas City, and St. Louis are largely protected by levees.
Near Kansas City and St. Louis, several residential, industrial, and commercial areas are built on floodplains behind levees that overtopped or failed in 1993.
Other residential, industrial, or commercial areas were flooded along the larger tributary streams in these urban areas.
Rural subdivisions are scattered along the river, many of which began as hunting and fishing camps and evolved into year-around communities.
These subdivisions provide inexpensive housing in part because of cheap land, lack of services such as sewer and water, limited land-use controls, and few building requirements.
On the major tributaries, the patterns of development are much the same as along the Mississippi and Missouri main stems, although the bottomlands are nar rower with fewer farmsteads.
The small towns along these tributaries often have floodprone neighborhoods, but most of the population lives in the adjoining uplands.
Table 1.1 includes information on land use and land cover categories for the floodplain and the flood extent for the study area.
The estimates of land use and land cover were developed using satellite imagery.
Population trends.
In general rural counties declared disaster areas in the nine states affected by the 1993 flood are losing population.
No data are available on gain or loss of floodplain populations during this period.
The only comparable data from the 1980 Census and the 1990 Census are aggregated by county or community.
Population increases that have occur red are generally in the suburban counties of major urban areas such as Minneapolis/St.
Paul, Des Moines, Kansas City, and St. Louis.
Loss of population in rural areas is the result of farm consolidation, lack of employment opportunities, and improvements in transportation.
Fewer farmers mean a lower demand for local goods and services, which has a ripple effect on the local economy.
Those who remain on the land drive to larger communities to shop and for many of the services previously provided by farm towns.
Such trends, not unlike those occur ring throughout the nation, are limiting development pressure within the floodplain.
Figure 1.2 shows the population gain or loss by county in the flood-affected 9-state region between 1980 and 1990.

The floodplain was identified using landform analysis and includes areas protected by levees and areas above the elevation of the 1993 flood.
The flood extent is the area flooded and includes some ponding in upland areas not in the geomor phologic floodplain.
Population characteristics.
The Review Committee found during visits to over 60 communities in the floodaffected region that the floodplain neighborhoods and rural subdivisions tended to be lower income neighborhoods of the community.
These neighborhoods appear to have a higher percentage of rental properties, more elderly residents, more young families more people on assistance, and lower value housing.
It is common to find homes in the floodplains of these communities that have market values of less than $25,000 and often as low as $10,000 or $5,000.
In part these neighborhoods may be low-income because they contain older housing and because they are floodprone.
In many of these communities these floodplain neighborhoods are an important source of affordable housing for low and moderate income families.
The U.S. Census data shown in Table 1.2 tend to confirm these observations.4 The data for the study area, however, is available only by community and by Census Block Group.
These geographic areas will generally include both floodplain and upland areas.
Demographic differences 7 THE FLOOD OF 1993 must be recognized and floodplain policies must be carefully designed to prevent inequities.5 Figure 1.2 Population Change, Nine Midwest States, 1980-1990.
Source: U.S. Bureau of the Census THE FLOOD EVENT The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that the Flood of 1993 caused at least 38 deaths, severe damages, and extreme hardship for the people of the Midwest.
Agricultural damages exceeded 50 percent of the total, but less than 30 percent of such damages were in the floodplains of the main stem rivers.
The majority of agricultural damages were in the uplands where the cause was wet soil conditions rather than inundation.
The duration of flooding caused people to be driven from their homes and businesses for an extended period.
In the major cities, such as St. Louis and Kansas City, damages were prevented by flood-control improvements.
In many areas past policies of federal, state, and local governments avoided potential damage by preventing development in the floodplain.
The Flood of 1993 in the Midwest was a hydrometeorological event without precedent in modern times.
In terms of precipitation amounts, record river levels, flood duration, area of flooding, and economic losses, it sur passed all previous floods in the United States.
During the period from June through September, record and near record precipitation fell on soil already saturated by previous seasonal rainfall and spring snowmelt, resulting in flooding along major rivers and their tributaries in the upper Mississippi River Basin.

(2) Per capita and median household income are lower for CBGs within the flood extent.
Mobile homes represent a considerably higher percentage of the housing units, another indication of a lower income population.
River levels exceeded flood stage at approximately 500 NWS river forecast points and record flooding occur red at 95 forecast points throughout the flood-affected region.6 At 45 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow gaging stations, the peak discharge rate (flowrate) exceeded that of the 1-percent annual-chance (100-year) flood value.
7 Not only extensive in magnitude and area, the 1993 flood was prolonged in time as evidenced by many locations that remained above flood stage for weeks, with some remaining for as long as five straight months.
experienced the second wettest November -- April period in 121 years of record.
This period was followed by above-normal precipitation over the upper Mississippi River Basin during April and May (Figure 1.3).
The April -- June period was the wettest observed in the upper Mississippi River Basin in the last 99 years.
Consequently even before the onset of the heavy summer rains, most upper basin soils were saturated, and many streams and rivers were flowing at well above seasonal normal levels.
Soil Conditions Prior to the 1993 Flood The antecedent conditions that gave rise to the Flood of 1993 include, in addition to record rainfalls, wet soil conditions that began in the central Great Plains during the summer of 1992 and rose rapidly with the increasing precipitation and cooling air temperatures of late 1992.
July, September, and especially November 1992 were much wetter than normal over the upper Mississippi River Basin.
That winter precipitation was near normal, but a wet spring followed.
By late March, extremely moist conditions covered much of the region as a result of the wet fall and spring snowmelt runoff.8 Iowa, which was centrally located in the area of heaviest flooding, Rainfall During much of the summer of 1993, a persistent atmospheric pattern of excessive rainfall occurred across much of the upper Mississippi River Basin.9 The major river flooding resulted primarily from numerous series of heavy rainfall events from June through late July.
The recur rence of heavy rainfall was the direct result of a stable upper-level atmospheric circulation pattern with a deep trough to the west of the upper Mississippi valley and a strong ridge along the East Coast (Figure 1.4).
In late July and early August, a change in the upper air circulation pattern brought drier conditions to the Midwest as the trough shifted eastward.
Locally heavy thunderstorms generated some additional flooding in parts of the soaked upper Mississippi River Basin during mid-August; 9 THE FLOOD OF 1993 Figure 1.3 Average and Observed Monthly Precipitation Totals for the Upper Mississippi River Basin Source: U.S. Department of commerce, NOAA, National Weather Service.
6 however, these rains were associated with a typical summertime pattern and not a return to the anomalous and persistent June and July atmospheric conditions.
During the June-August 1993 period, rainfall totals surpassed 12 inches across the eastern Dakotas, southern Minnesota, eastern Nebraska, and most of Wisconsin, Kansas Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana.
Over 24 inches of rain fell on central and northeastern Kansas, northern and central Missouri, most of Iowa, southern Minnesota, and southeastern Nebraska.
Up to 38.4 inches fell in east-central Iowa.
Generally precipitation amounts were 200 to 350 percent of normal from the northern plains southeastward into the central Corn Belt.
Rainfall amounts over the upper Mississippi River Basin during the May-August 1993 period are unmatched in the historical records of the central United States.
In July broad areas in the lower Missouri River Basin experienced rainfall amounting to four times normal.
The series of storms producing these record rainfalls were remarkable not only in their magnitude but also for their broad regional extent; record wetness existed over 26,000 sq. mi. of the upper Mississippi River Basin.
Seasonal rainfall records were shattered in all rainfall amounts equaled those computed for storm frequencies having 75-year to 300-year recurrence intervals.
Figure 1.4 shows the weather pattern that existed in 1993.
10 THE FLOOD OF 1993 INCREDIENTS FOR A MAJOR FLOOD The following weather facts tell why Iowa flooded in 1993: Wettest period.

6 11 THE FLOOD OF 1993 River Flow The deluge across the upper Mississippi River Basin produced record setting peak flow rates and water levels in many tributaries and in the main stem rivers, including a large reach of the upper Mississippi, over the full reach of the middle Mississippi, and over much of the length of the lower Missouri River.
Flooding began in the northern portion of the upper Mississippi River Basin in June and then moved southward with the shifting of the stormproducing weather pattern and the travel of the flood flows downstream as summer progressed.
Rainfall was particularly heavy between June 17 and 20 in southwest Minnesota and northwest Iowa, causing record flooding on the Minnesota River.
The next major pulse of precipitation occurred from June 23-25.
Runoff from these rains combined with flood flows from the Minnesota River to initiate the first flood crest that moved down the upper Mississippi River.
Following a short, dry period, a prolonged siege of heavy precipitation occurred from June 30 to July 11.
This included extreme amounts of rainfall on July 9 in Iowa, which produced record flooding on the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers.
Just as the crests from these two rivers reached Des Moines, a relatively small, convective pocket dumped several inches of rain on the crests rapidly boosting the river levels and flooding the city's water treatment plant.
The intense rainfall during this period also led to record flooding on portions of the lower Missouri River and combined with the crest already rolling down the Mississippi to establish record river stages from the Quad Cities area on the upper Mississippi River downstream to Thebes, Illinois, on the middle Mississippi River.
Another major precipitation event occur red from July 2125.
The heaviest rains were focused farther south than the earlier events, with especially heavy rain falling over eastern Nebraska and Kansas, leading to the second major crests on both the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.
Hydrographs, of river stages (elevations) over time for the Missouri River at Kansas City and the upper Mississippi River at the Quad Cities are shown in Figure 1.5.
The Kansas City graph shows two flood peaks, one caused by the June 30 to July 11 rainfall and the other by rain falling from July 21-25.
The Quad Cities graph shows only the single peak from the earlier period.
This comparison demonstrates the generally southern focus of this second event.
Both peaks are evident on the hydrograph for the Mississippi River at St. Louis (Figure 1.5).
While flooding from the latter rainfall period did not extend as far upstream on the Mississippi River, new record river levels occur red at many locations downstream and on much of that portion of the Missouri River that flows through Missouri.
Figure 1.6 shows those reaches of main stem and tributary rivers where peak stages exceeded previous record levels and where they reached unusually high but not record levels.
Above normal rains continued to occur over pats of the flood-affected region during August, especially over Iowa where accumulations were twice the normal monthly amount over much of the state.
By mid-September, however, rainfall began to diminish and rivers began to recede.
Then, at the end of September, a strong system of thunderstorms deposited 1 to 3 inches of rain over the State of Missouri and 7 inches or more from the central part of the state eastward.
The consequence was major flash flooding on many tributaries and new flood crests on the lower Missouri and middle Mississippi rivers.
Farmlands behind previously breached levees were reflooded and two people drowned in separate incidents.
Many roads were washed out and there was much damage to property in Missouri.
Conclusion: Wet antecedent soil and swollen river conditions, record rainfall, and significant upland runoff resulted in 1993 flood flows that ranged from below the 100- year up to the 500-year recurrence interval magnitude at many locations.

6 14 THE FLOOD OF 1993 DAMAGES REPORTED Estimates of total damages in the Midwest from weather events during 1993 range between $12 billion and $16 billion.
Over half of these were agricultural damages to crops, livestock, fields, levees, farm buildings, and equipment.
The remaining damages were primarily to residences, businesses, public facilities, or transportation.
Much of the agricultural damage occur red in upland areas as the result of wet fields and a short growing season rather than inundation by floodwaters.
Similarly a portion of residential and business damages was caused by basement flooding due to high groundwater and sewer back-up in areas outside the floodplain.
The NWS has estimated damages for the Midwest flood at $15.7 billion based on information provided by its field offices.10 This estimate was based on totals by state, but did not include breakdowns of damage by type.
In August 1993 The New York Times published an estimate of nearly $12 billion in damages based on information it obtained from state and federal officials.11 State and federal officials could not assess all damages until floodwaters receded, and the full extent of agricultural damages was not known until after the end of the growing season.
Most of the affected states have updated their damage estimates, and the total ranges from $12 billion to $13 billion.
The available estimates are summarized in Table 1.3.
The Review Committee developed an estimate of flood damages using federal payments and making assumptions as to what percentage of damages those payments represent.
This information indicates that total damages were ore than $12 billion with as much as $4 billion to $5 billion of that total being agricultural damages in upland areas.
Table 1.3 Damage Estimates for 1993 Midwest Flooding, in Millions of Dollars NWS Totals 2,640 5,740 551 964 3,430 295 414 763 904 15,701 State Totals 1,000-2,000 
No federal agency is responsible for developing accurate assessments of flood damages, nor is funded to do so.
The affected states and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) conduct preliminary damage assessments to determine if a Presidential disaster declaration is war ranted and to estimate the resources necessary for response and recovery.
Once sufficient damage has been identified that justifies a declaration on once FEMA has a general idea of how resources should be allocated, federal agencies have little incentive to expend resources updating preliminary assessments.
Resources are instead focused on tracking and projecting expenditures.
The NWS is not funded to estimate total damages but does so to support other missions.
The USACE, which in the past estimated flood damages, is no longer funded to do so.
The Review Committee is concerned that decisions involving hundreds of millions of dollars often are being made without systematic assessments of flood damages and without a clear understanding of the nature and extent of those damages.
In Illinois, only 3 percent of the state's corn and soybean acreage (312,000 and 276,000 acres respectively) were lost to flooding with a loss in sales of $153.4 million.15 Minnesota farmers lost $500 million in crop sales, but most of the damage was caused by wet conditions rather than riverine flooding.
16 Damage from scour and deposition affected 455,000 acres on the Missouri River floodplain representing 20 percent of the flooded cropland along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.
17 Drainage ditches were filled with sediments, and other agricultural infrastructure was destroyed.
Almost 60,000 acres have sand deposition more than 24 inches thick and reclamation costs to restore fertility to damaged cropland are approximately $190/acre.18 If cropland restoration requires removal of sand, it would cost approximately $3,200 to remove each acre-foot of sand.
19 It will cost $10.8 million to remove sediment and debris from ditches.20 Secondary impacts of agricultural losses to a local economy vary substantially with the dependence of that economy on the agricultural sector.
Immediate losses are due to lost sales and unemployment.
In the long run, the assessed value of land that sustained long-term damage may be reduced which will affect the property tax base of affected communities.
Another secondary effect was a reduction in crop-support payments after prices adjusted to the reduced production caused by wet weather in the Midwest and drought in the Southeast in 1993.
This loss to farmers was a gain for Agriculture Agricultural damages from the Flood of 1993 had two primary causes: excessive moisture that prevented planting and reduced yields in upland and floodplain areas and actual flooding that destroyed crops and severely damaged many acres of fertile floodplain cropland.
It is difficult to separate the factors that influenced crop production during the 1993 growing season in the 9-state region.
They included rain, low temperatures, early frost, and floods.
More then 70 percent of the crop disaster assistance payments, however, were made to counties in upland areas -- not in main stem river floodplains.13 Agricultural damages directly attributed to actual flooding totaled more than $2.5 billion, with an estimated $1.4 billion in lost corn and soybean sales.
Most of these losses were restricted to 1993 as the productive capacity of the land was unchanged.
There were, however, damages to field fertility and farm infrastructure of at least $100 million.
Each state suffered different types of losses.
For example, Missouri with 34 percent of its cropland (5.1 million acres) in the floodplain , had crop damages from flooding on 3.1 million acres causing $247 million in lost sales.14 16 THE FLOOD OF 1993 taxpayers since subsidies represent transfer payments.
For corn, these deficiency payments were reduced by more than $2.6 billion.21 These price effects and subsequent reduction in deficiency payments will be temporary, if the 1994 crop supply returns to past levels.
Disaster Housing Program.
Among this latter group, 89,734 applications have been approved.
The Disaster Housing Program data indicates that more than 100,000 residences were flooded.
25 The fluctuating numbers illustrate an overlooked characteristic of this flood.
While the media focused on flooding of communities along the main stem Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their major tributaries, at least as many families were impacted by flooded basements due to high groundwater, overloaded storm sewer systems, or sewer back-up.
Many of the homes with flooded basements were not in the 100-year floodplain or behind levees that overtopped or failed.
In Cook County, Illinois, for instance, large numbers of homes on the south and west sides of Chicago had basement flooding due to storm water and sewer back-up caused by heavy rainfall which overwhelmed the city's combined storm and sanitary sewer system.
The county was eventually added to the Illinois disaster declaration even though this type of damage generally does not war rant inclusion.
Over half of the 60,448 registrations for individual disaster assistance in Illinois and 20 Percent of the registrations for the entire 9state region were in Cook County.26 Businesses sustained significant physical damages particularly in urban areas such as St. Louis County and the Kansas City areas of Missouri.
Much of this damage occur red behind levees that failed or were overtopped.
The 1996 National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claims payments made to small businesses26 and the 4,667 Small Business Administration (SBA) loans for Conclusion: The majority of 1993 agricultural damages in the Midwest were caused by wet soil conditions and inundation in upland areas.
Damage to inundated cropland in the floodplain was significant with almost complete crop losses behind failed levees.
Areas affected by severe erosion and deposition may suffer long-term loss of productivity.
Residences and Businesses Estimates vary on the number of homes flooded and families impacted by the Midwest flood.
Surveys made by Red Cross workers immediately after the floods identified more than 55,000 flooded residences.22 FEMA subsequently verified these damages with Red Cross chapters and developed an updated estimate of 70,545 residences.23 The New York Times estimated that more than 84,000 residences were damaged.
24 As of April 11, 1994, the federal government had received 167,224 registrations for individual assistance and 112,042 applications for the 17 THE FLOOD OF 1993 damages to businesses26 indicate that in excess of 5,000 individual businesses were damaged.
No overall damage estimates for businesses are available, but a measure of this damages, SBA loans to businesses, exceeded $334 million for physical damage29 and economic injury.
Add to these loans NFIP flood insurance payments for small businesses and other non-residential buildings that exceed $94 million, 30 and the total exceeds $431 million.
In addition to physical damage to buildings and their contents, lost profits and wages from businesses closed by the flood had local and regional impacts.
For example, an American Cyanamid Plant near Hannibal, Missouri, was protected by its own levee and not damaged by floodwaters, but the plant was shut down for nearly three month because its access road was inundated when an agricultural levee failed.
Transportation Systems Rivers and river valleys historically have been major transportation routes, particularly in the area impacted by the 1993 flood.
In the Midwest, transcontinental railroads, interstate highways, and other road systems either follow river valleys or cross them.
As a result, physical damages to transportation systems form a significant percentage of total flood damages.
In addition to direct damages, indirect costs accrue when transportation routes are inundated by floodwaters, and traffic is halted or detoured.
A major portion of flood damages to public facilities I n1993 involved roads and bridges.
These damages ranged from blown culverts and wash-outs on rural roads and city streets to loss of bridges and damages to interstate highways inundated by floodwaters.
The repair of flooddamaged roads and bridges generally is funded through the FEMA Public Assistance Program or the Department of Transportation.
Funds expended by those agencies when added to the state/local cost share for public assistance indicated that total physical damages to roads and bridge exceeded $250 million.
31 Road and bridge flooding caused indirect losses related to increased transportation costs.
In extreme cases, detours of 100 miles were required to travel between adjoining communities that had been connected by a bridge.
Often bridges were elevated high above the river to allow for navigation or to minimize hydraulic impacts of floods, but bridge approaches built at or near the natural elevation of the floodplain were inundated by floodwaters.
Even though the bridge was undamaged and the approach damage was minimal, the economic impacts on the communities served by the bridge could be extreme, particularly for a long duration flood such as occurred in 1993.
For example, Keokuk, Iowa, was cut off from market areas in Illinois and Missouri for several weeks when the approaches to bridges over the Mississippi and Des Moines rivers were inundated.
This resulted in serious economic impacts on local businesses.
Flooding of the approaches to the bridge over the Mississippi River at Quincy, Illinois, for 73 days resulted in an estimated $30 million in lost business to Quincy merchants.32 In addition, many people who lived in Missouri and could not commute to work in Illinois were temporarily unemployed.
Fer ries were eventually established to address part of this problem.
The full magnitude of these losses are reflected in over 36,000 claims approved for a total of $92 million in Disaster Unemployment Assistance.33 Historically railroads were built in floodplains and river valleys to minimize construction and fuel costs.
Main lines continue to parallel both the Missouri and 18 THE FLOOD OF 1993 Mississippi rivers.
Although generally tracks are elevated on embankments above the elevation of most floods or are located behind levees, they remain subject to major flood events.
In 1993 over 800 miles of track were flooded and several main lines were inundated for varying periods of time, but most trains were routed around flooded areas.
The Association of American Railroads estimates that railroad damages totaled $182 million, including $131 million in physical damages to tracks, bridges, signals, communication lines, switches, locomotives, rolling stock, and buildings.
Additional cost of $51 million resulted from detouring trains around sections of flooded track.34 Repair costs are generally borne by the railroads themselves although $21 million was distributed to railroads through the Supplemental Appropriation for Local Rail Freight Assistance.35 Airports often are located in floodplains because of the flat terrain and close proximity to urban areas.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has identified 33 air ports with varying degrees of flood damages.
Estimated repair costs exceed $5.4 million.
The air ports range in size from the Spirit of St. Louis Air port in St. Louis Country, Missouri, to airports that are little more than grass landing strips with a few hangars for private aviation.
Most of the flooded airports were in Missouri (16) and Iowa (12).
The Spirit of St. Louis Air port, and alternate for Lambert-St. Louis Airport, sustained $1.7 million in damages when the Monarch-Chesterfield Levee failed.
Other major air ports that were flooded included those at Creve Couer and Jefferson City and the Kansas City Downtown Air port.
Several smaller air ports remain closed and may not reopen.36 Illinois alone.
Regional impacts on jobs from barge and port disruptions were also greatest in Illinois.38 Public Facilities The Midwest flood caused extensive damages to water and wastewater treatment plants and other public facilities.
Damages to utilities, including water and wastewater treatment facilities and storm sewer systems, exceeded $84 million.
39 Water treatment plants often are located in floodplains to be near well fields or the surface water that supplies the system.
In addition, water supply lines must cross floodplains to serve floodplain residents.
The EPA has identified 200 municipal water systems impacted to some degree by the flood.40 The most prominent example is the Des Moines Water Works that serves the City of Des Moines and adjoining communities.
The plant was flooded and remained out of operation for 12 days, and water from it was not safe to drink for another seven days.
In addition to physical damages of $12 million, significant impacts were felt in the service area.41 Businesses and government offices closed because of lack of fire protection, and bottled water and portable toilets had to be provided for residents.
The economic impact of the shutdown may far exceed thee cost repair of the physical damage.
Wastewater treatment plants tend to be located in floodplains which are generally the lowest point in a community and offer the advantage of gravity flow.
Furthermore the effluent from these plants is discharged into major rivers or streams.
The impact of flooding ranges from temporary plant shutdown and the discharge of raw sewage into the river during the flood to physical damage that results in extended plant shutdowns and continued discharges of raw sewage or partially treated effluent until such time as the plant can be repaired.
A total of 388 wastewater facilities were impacted by the flood.
42 Damages to public buildings exceeded $27 million.
Water control facilities had more than $20 million in damages, and facilities such as parks and other recreation facilities Navigation Most of the main stem rivers were closed to barge traffic from July 11 until August 15, 1993, and severe limitations on barge traffic continued through September, October, and November.
The Maritime Administration estimated that losses of revenue to the navigation industry were $300 million per month.37 More than $165 million were lost in 19 THE FLOOD OF 1993 recorded more than $22 million.
These estimates are based on FEMA projections of infrastructure spending that include a 10-percent local cost share.
43 management applications such as the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge and the Upper Mississippi River Wildlife and Fish Refuge provided for storage and conveyance of a portion of the 1993 floodwaters within the floodplains of the lower Minnesota and upper Mississippi River valleys.
Refuges, parklands, green ways, and agriculture are examples of appropriate floodplain uses that reduce flood damages by minimizing the number of structures at risk.
The National Flood Insurance Program.
The NFIP has not encouraged floodplain development in the Midwest and, in combination with state and local floodplain management programs, appears to have discouraged it.
The NFIP has discouraged floodplain development by (1) increasing awareness of flooding by identifying and mapping the flood hazard, (2) internalizing the cost of floodplain occupancy, making development in the floodplain more costly (i.e., added cost of protecting buildings from flooding and the added cost of the NFIP flood insurance premium), and (3) requiring additional permitting and engineering studies that developers and individuals may choose to avoid.
The Review Committee met with a number of communities in the Midwest, large and small, that actively discourage development in their floodplains even if permitted by federal or state regulations.
This "steering" of development to flood-free locations has deterred new floodplain development in these communities.
Approximately 93 percent of the properties which are located in the 100-year floodplain in the flooded area and are cur rently insured by the NFIP were constructed before the issuance of a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community and conversion of the community to the Regular Program of the NFIP, 46 i.e., between December 31, 1974 and the early to mid-1980's.
Floodplain management regulations appear to have prevented or reduced damages to new construction (post-FIRM construction).
These buildings sustained proportionally fewer losses than older buildings even though the flood elevations exceeded the 100-year design standard in many locations.
These new buildings comprise 6.4 percent of the insured floodplain buildings in the declared counties, but account for only 3.2 percent of the losses.47 DAMAGES PREVENTED Management and structural practices prevented damages from being worse than they were.
These practices involved nonstructural solutions, upland conservation treatment, and major flood control projects.
Nonstructural Flood Protection The term "nonstructural measures" is used to describe techniques that "modify susceptibility to flooding (such as regulation, floodplain acquisition, and flood proofing techniques)."44 A nonstructural approach to flood damage prevention was effective in the town of Prairie Du Chein, Wisconsin where the flood was a 40- to 50- year event.
Prairie du Chein was the site of the first relocation project undertaken by the USACE and car ried out between 1978 and 1984.
A measure of the project's success was reported by the Red Cross workers came to town but left within two weeks because no one needed their help.45 Relocation had freed citizens of anxiety about the risk of flood damage to their home and businesses.
Nonstructural land 20 THE FLOOD OF 1993 Figure 1.7 indicates a significant reduction in the number of buildings built in the floodplain after 1980.
Since insured buildings tend to include newer, more expensive buildings with mortgages subject to the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement, the percentage and numbers of all buildings built prior to enactment of the NFIP are likely to be even higher.
Figure 1.7 Construction Dates NFIP Insured Buildings in the Nine Midwest States Upland Watershed Treatment The Flood of 1993 demonstrated the value of f installing flood-prevention measures and of improving land treatment practices on agricultural lands throughout the watershed.
In upland watershed areas, the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) small watershed projects prevented damages estimated at $400 million.
Crop losses to landowners were lower in areas with upland watershed treatment.
An example is the SCS project on the Grindstone-lost Muddy Watershed Project that protects approximately 60 percent of Dekalb County and portions of Clinton, Gentry, and Davies counties in Missouri.
Flood protection on the 326-sq. mi. watershed includes land treatment, flood prevention, multi-pur pose flood control reservoirs, and erosion grade control structures.
The project area recorded two storms exceeding the 1percent chance of occur rence in July and September 1993.
Estimated agricultural benefits accrued were $915,900 for the July storm and $989,700 for September storm with road and bridge benefits of $66,000 and $70,000.
Agricultural disaster payments per acre in Dekalb County were less than half those paid in neighboring counties.
Since the storm, local people have donated $2,000 to purchase landrights for construction of remaining flood control reservoirs.

Flood Damage Reduction Projects The USACE estimates that flood-control facilities in place during the 1993 flood prevented $19.1 billion in damages.48 Of that total, $11.5 billion in damages were prevented along the Missouri River.
Damages prevented by the water control management of flood storage reservoirs amounted to $7.4 billion in the Missouri River Basin; $4.0 billion by the storage of flood water in the six main stem Missouri River reservoirs on the tributaries.
The other 4.1 billion in damages prevented along Missouri River is attributed to levee projects.
USACE and Bureau of Reclamation flood control reservoirs on the main stem and tributaries in the Missouri River Basin reduced peak discharges on the Missouri River by storing over 17 million acre-feet of flood water between June and August.49 In the St. Louis metropolitan area, a combination of upstream reservoirs, levees, and floodwall prevented damages of approximately $3 billion.
Upstream reservoirs and levees also prevented damages of about 5.6 billion at Kansas City.
Acquisition and relocation.
Acquisition or relocation of floodprone building through federal programs or state and local initiatives continues to be an important strategy for reducing potential flood damages.
Successful buy-out programs normally are a response to a flood or series of floods.
Implementation occurs over a multi-year period, as funding becomes available.
The Review Committee identified more than 600 buildings in the upper Mississippi River Basin which have been acquired and relocated out of floodprone areas over the past 20 years.
Most of these buildings had been damaged previously by floods and would have been severely damaged by the higher waters of the Flood of 1993.
21 THE FLOOD OF 1993 Conclusion: Damages from the 1993 flood were reduced significantly through use of nonstructural and structural measures.
RESPONSE AND RECOVERY COSTS By the end of the flood, nine state disaster declarations included more than 525 counties.
Cur rent estimated federal response and recovery cost include 4.2 billion in direct federal expenditures, $1.3 billion in payments from federal insurance programs, and more that $621 million in federal loans to individuals, businesses, and communities.
A review of the types and amounts of federal response and recovery cost by state illustrate again the differences in types of damages among the nine states.
In the upper basin states of Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota and in Wisconsin and northern Iowa, the losses were primarily to agriculture, much of it in upland areas.
Along the main stems of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their major tributaries in Missouri, Illinois, and central Iowa, significant losses occur red in agriculture as a result of bottomland flooding, but urban areas also recorded damages.
Crop disaster payments.
Disaster payments are made for production and quality losses of most commercially grown crops when losses are caused by damaging weather and related condition.
Production losses related to prevented planting and low yield are eligible for compensation.
The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of USDA can authorize crop disaster payments without a Presidential Disaster Declaration.
Participation in pricesupport programs does not affect eligibility or payment levels.
Producers with crop insurance qualify if losses are greater than 35 percent of expected production; and those without crop insurance qualify if losses are greater than 40 percent.
For most crops grown in the 9-state region, payments are calculated by determining the eligible amount of loss and multiplying it by 65 percent.
As a general rule of thumb, farmers can expect disaster payments to cover 40 percent of expected cash receipts.
50 For 1993, yields less than 9 bushels an acre of corn or 4 bushels per acre of wheat counted as total losses for calculation of disaster payments.
Figure 1.8 shows the location of crop disaster payments in the 9-state region.
More than 70 percent (1.02 billion) went to the prairie pothole Federal Expenditures Federal expenditures represent disaster response and recovery cost borne by the federal government.
Among these are disaster assistance payments to individuals and farmers, costs to repair levees and other infrastructure, costs to provide health and social services; and cost associated with hazard mitigation, housing, and community development.

53 Cropland in this area of hydric soils and excessive rainfall does not drain well.
The majority of payments went to farmers participating in commodity programs (Table 1.5), but damages would have been higher without farmer enrollment because the 6 million acres of land set aside (the 1993 requirement for program participation) would have incurred crop losses if production has been allowed.
Midwest flood; the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Federal Crop Insurance Program.
Claims payments by federal insurance programs are distinct from federal expenditures.
Table 1.6 summarizes claims payments from these programs by state.
Under both programs, individuals pay an annual insurance premium to the government and the government provides insurance coverage.
Tables showing insurance payments from the NFIP and the Federal Crop Insurance Cor poration (FCIC) follow.
National Flood Insurance Program.
Flood Insurance coverage on buildings and their contents is available through the NFIP participating communities.
Under Federal Insurance Programs The federal government operates two insurance programs that provided claims payments to those impacted by the 26 THE FLOOD OF 1993 Table 1.6 Dollars Summary of Federal Insurance Claims Payments by State for the 1993 Midwest Floods in Millions of Program Federal Crop Insurance Program Claims Payments National Flood Insurance Program Claims Payments Total Claims Total IL IA KS MS MO NE ND SD WI 1017.0 25.4 281.2 40.4 353.9 27.7 49.0 139.3 54.1 46.0 297.3 1,314.

the NFIP insurance premiums for buildings that predate the identification of the flood hazard in a particular community are subsidized, but for buildings built after that date, premiums are based on full actuarial rates.
All costs of administering the program, including the costs of floodplain mapping and salaries of federal employees are charged to policyholders.
The Midwest flood was the third most costly in terms of NFIP payments, exceeded only by Hur ricane Hugo and the December 1992 coastal storm that struck New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Delaware, and Connecticut.
In 1993, over half of the losses and two thirds of the payments were in Missouri.
States in the upper basin had lower average payments since buildings were generally subjects to shallow flooding along tributaries which flooded basements and some first floors.
States in the lower basin had much higher average losses reflecting the deep flooding in the bottoms along the main stems of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers (Table 1.7 and Figure 1.9).
High average payments in Missouri also reflect large payments to small businesses and other non-residential building, particularly in Ã¯Â¿Â½hesterfield and elsewhere in St. Louis County.
Even in the counties with disaster status, in excess of 80,000 insured properties did not overtop or fail, but most were on tributaries that did not flood or where flooding was of less than 100 year frequency.
Federal Crop Insurance Program.
Farmers can protect themselves from actual crop losses or prevented planting caused by uncontrollable natural events through purchase of crop insurance from the FCIC.
This government cor poration within the USDA provides coverage for 51 crops in the event of loss from drought, excess soil moisture, flood, frost, hail, wind, insects, and other natural perils.
Historically drought has been the major cause of crop loss (55 percent) while floods represent only two percent of claims.
Excess soil moisture, however, represents 16 percent of losses.
Farmers must purchase the insurance early in the crop year.
For example, a policy to cover a corn crop planted in 1994 in the Midwest would have to be purchased by April 15.
Farmers can choose the level of insurance that they wish to purchase, but they are not able to insure their crop for the full value.
Maximum coverage is 75 percent of expected crop yield.54 To encourage participation, the federal government subsidizes crop insurance premiums up to 30 percent and pays administrative, actuarial, underwriting, and selling expenses.
Table 1.8 shows the participation rate purchases in the 9-state area for 1993 indemnities paid to policyholders.
Pa lowest in the corn/soybean region and for crop insurance as well as the rticipation is highest where 27 THE FLOOD OF 1993 Table 1.7 NFIP Flood Insurance Losses for the Period from April 1 Through September 30, 1993 by State for the 1993 Midwest Floods.

wheat is the principal crop.
The largest claims were in the prairie pothole region (as were the bulk of the crop disaster payments) rather than in the floodplains.
The probability of participation in the crop insurance program is lower for floodplain farmers than for those in the upland because flood damage is, in general, more localized than drought which is the primary hazard in the Midwest.
Loans.
Federal agencies have approved $623 million in loans to individuals, businesses, and communities impacted by the Midwest flood.
These loans, which must be repaid, as a federal expenditure only to the degree that interest rates are subsidized, bor rowers default on loans, and administrative costs are incur red (See Table 1.9).
The primary source of the loans is the Small Business Administration (SBA) Disaster Loan Program, which provided $597 million in loans to flood-affected homeowners and renters, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofit organizations.
Interest subsidies, defaults, and administrative costs amount to approximately 30 percent of the loans.55 Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) is the source of agricultural loans because SBA is prohibited from making loans to farmers.
Federal income tax deductions.
Uninsured and otherwise unreimbursed losses resulting from casualties such as a flood are deductible for Federal Income Tax purposes to the extent that they exceed 10 percent of Federal Adjusted Gross Income plus 100.
His deduction results in decreased tax revenue to the federal government.
The Internal Revenue Service provides tax counseling to disaster victims to assist them in applying for refunds by amending their previous years tax return when a major disaster is declared.
The loss of tax revenue has not been quantified for the Midwest flood.
Due to the amount of insurance and disaster assistance payments, the income levels of many of the flood victims, and requirement that the loss exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income, the loss may not be substantial.
The casualty loss deduction, however, does act as an additional mechanism for transferring the costs of flood damage from the private sector to the federal government.

Because the FEMA provided assistance at a 90/10 cost share, the state/local share was approximately $42 million for Public Assistance and nearly the same amount for assistance to indivuduals.56 States and communities also had unreimbursed expenses associated with response and recovery.
State and local costs for the restoration of damaged levees and watershed exceeded 130 million.
These expenditures were part of the USACE 80/20 and the SCS 75/25 required cost shares.
Of greater concern to some communities is the short and long-term reductions in real estate tax revenues as properties are reassessed to reflect flood damages to building and agricultural lands or losses in market value due to the increased awareness of the flood hazard.
In those areas, where homes are not being rebuilt and fields are not being restored, these losses will be permanent.
Impact aid from the U.S. Department of Education, currently budgeted at $70 million, will replace a part of the lost tax revenues that would have gone to schools.57 At the state level, losses in tax revenue may result from lost profits and wages.
Partial compensation for these losses may come in part from the increased economic activity of the recovery effort and from federal assistance.
two herbicides (altrazine and cyanazine) in some samples from the Mississippi River exceeded health-based limits for drinking water; however, the annual concentration was not expected to exceed those limits for 1993.63 The cumulative impact of any flood-related releases of hazardous materials, including pesticides, herbicides, and other toxic materials has not been established.
The effects of flooding on groundwater hydrology and groundwater quality have yet to be determined.
In response to concerns regarding the safety of private wells, the Administration established a well-water contamination survey in coordination with the nine-flood states.64 The EPA performed floodwater quality sampling around major metropolitan areas on the Missouri River.
In some cases, drinking water standards were exceeded, but the majority of the readings posed no health risk.65 Results from sampling of treated drinking water revealed three location where Maximum Contaminant Levels were exceeded although results from a single sample do not necessarily indicate a problem.66 USGS and National Oceanic and Atmospheric (NOAA) have not found significant changes in water chemistry since the 1993 flood.67 Impacts of the flooding on the distribution of contaminated river sediments is also unknown.
Studies are underway to determine sediment chemistry and characterize sediment deposition patterns in rivers and streams.68 Effects of the flood on public and mental health are largely anecdotal.
Some communities noted increases in spousal and child abuse and numbers of calls for police response.
Mental health effects of community and individual buyout/relocation are poorly understood.
Several studies are cur rently being completed to assess the human response to the 1993 flood and to evaluate the factors that strain the ability of families to function adaptively to the event.69 Experience with other floods indicates that out breaks of Equine, Western, and St. Louis encephalitidies can be expected two years after flooding event (due to the lag time in amplification of disease vectors).70 The length of time between the flood event and the appearance of disease adds to the problem of attributing costs.
The flood took its toll on historic and cultural resources Non-Quantifiable Costs The EPA determined that 59 Superfund sites experienced flooding; however, impacts to the sites were minimal and corrective measures have been completed on sites requiring them.58 In addition, 73 solid waste treatment,59 storage, and disposal sites were also flooded,60 and large propane tanks that were dislodged floated downriver creating the potential for massive explosions.
Besides the large propane tanks, the states collected over 18,000 orphaned drums61 -- each with a potential hazardous or toxic substance -- and a large amount of household hazardous wastes whose disposal was necessitated by the flooding.
Daily loads of agricultural chemicals (herbicides and Nitrates) transported by the Mississippi River were large relative to previous years; record flooding did not dilute the concentrations of herbicides.62 Concentrations of 30 THE FLOOD OF 1993 Table 1.9 Summary of Amount of Federal Loans by State for the 1993 Midwest Flood in Millions of Dollars Program Small Business Administration Disaster Loans Rural Development Administration Loans Farmers Home Administration Emergency Disaster Loans Total Amount Approved Total IL IA KS MN MO NE ND SE WI 597.3 9.3 134.7 ---- 108.55 6.7 31.6 1.2 27.4 ---- 235.3 0.7 14.2 0.1 16.1 --- 16.7 0.6 12.8 --- 14.7 621.3 2.1 136.8 7.3 122.5 0.1 32.9 2.4 29.8 0.9 236.9 0.1 14.4 0.2 16.3 0.9 18.2 0.8 13.6 Source: Kuilik, Bernard, Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance, U.S. Small Business Administration, personal communication, May 3, 1994; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Flood Information Center, "USDA Emercency Assistance Paid to Flood States," April 4, 1994.

A cemetery in Hardin, Missouri was inundated which disinter red over 500 bodies.
There were several American Indian tribes affected by the Flood of 1993.
The SAC and Fox of the Mississippi in Iowa (Mesquakie) lost 10 homes and the ceremonial area of their Pow-wow grounds.71 The Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas had damages to their crops, bridges, roads, and water systems.72 Indian lands in the prairie pothole are were saturated by frequent rains.
Local lakes flooded homes on the shore and contaminated drinking water wells.
Well and lake water continue to be monitored for pesticides, animal wastes, and other pollutants potentially car ried by runoff to the upland lakes.73 Preliminary field investigations by state and federal forestry staff in Mississippi River navigation pools 25 and 26 revealed that all hackberry and sugarber ry and a large percentage of sycamore appeared to be dead or dying at those locations.
Similar effects might be expected elsewhere in the Basin's floodplain where flood duration coincided with the entire growing season.
Hackber ry and sugarber ry are important mast-producing trees, and mature sycamore are frequently selected by species of colonial nesting birds.74 The full effects on forest canopy and subcanopy structure will not be know for years to come.
Conclusion: Not all costs of the Flood of 1993 can be quantified in monetary terms, but bot quantifiable and non-quantifiable costs were significant in magnitude and importance.
BENEFICIAL EFFECTS Flooding is a natural phenomenon of every river.
Historically, floodwater enriched bottomlands and provided spawning habitats for native fish.
The ecological value of maintaining connections between the river and its floodplain and the flood-pulse advantage are among the benefits conveyed by a flood.75 The 1993 flood connected many midwestern rivers with their floodplains, and for the first time in decades this flood coincided with the natural spawning period of riverine fishes.
The benefits of this inundation to fisheries and aquatic resources was evidenced anecdotally in reports of fishermen utilizing newly created scour holes, and empirically in fisheries samples collected as part of the fall fish sampling for the cooperative interagency (USACE, FWS, and 5 states) upper Mississippi River System Long Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP).
Catches of young-of-theyear fish in fall 1993 samples (after the flood) were greater than numbers of such fish collected in all samples for the entire 1992 samplings year (before the flood).76 31 THE FLOOD OF 1993 ENDNOTES 1.

The analysis was based on those Census Block Groups (CBGs) whose centroids were in the flood extent and the floodplain as mapped by the SAST team.
These CBGs then were compared to CBGs with their centroids in uplands.
Although most of the CBGs with centroids within the flood extent and floodplain contain extensive upland areas, the data are an indicator that areas inundated by the Midwest flood differ from the upland areas.
The data were developed for both CBGs within Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) and those outside of those areas.

The amount paid for a claim is based on loss below the coverage amount.
For example , a farmer with a 65 percent level of crop insurance who lost half of his or her crop would be compensated for 15 percent of the crop value (65% - 50% = %15).
A farmer with a 35 percent level (the minimum) would get no compensation.
The price paid per unit of eligible crop loss can be selected as the market price or as a percentage of an established.

35 36 Chapter 2 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION In the matter of floodplain management, most people agree that some combination of structural and nonstructural methods are probably a better approach than the previous complete reliance on dams and levees.
Luna B. Leopold Water Resources Update, Issue No. 95: Spring, 1994 HISTORY The rivers and streams of the Midwest were focal points for early settlement because they provided sources of drinking water and avenues for transportation and trade.
Once settlements were established along rivers, the problem of controlling floods to protect human life and investments became readily apparent.
At first small mounds of dirt were thrown up to divert water away from towns, and over the course of time, these mounds became levees and floodwalls.
Many people living in floodplains behind those levees and floodwalls remain at risk because of decisions made many years ago.
The modern challenge is to reduce those risks.
As settlers spread west they altered prairie, forest, meandering streams, and free-flowing river landscapes to provide arable farmland, raw materials for homes and industry, and transportation.
Federal policies encouraged extensive private land development which then required construction of reservoirs and levees for flood protection.
Human use thus changed midwestern landscapes to the detriment of natural ecological systems.
The Flood of 1993 raised questions as tow what extent these landscape changes have contributed to flood frequency and duration.
Agricultural Policy and Farm Production Since the 1930s, when one quarter of the population lived on farms, U.S. farm policy has used a system of price supports (loans, purchases, payments, or a combination of methods) to improve farm income and promote conservation, while assuring a dependable Food supply for the United States.
The Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Ace of 1990 (FACTA) continued the market orientation of its predecessor, the Food Security Act of 1985.
Stated goals of the 1990 Farm Bill (FACTA) were to ease financial stress on farmers, reduce government costs, reduce crop sur pluses, maintain export competitiveness, and enhance environmental quality.
Among the best know features of the farm policy are the Production Adjustment/Price Support Programs administered by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Appendix C provides an example of how price supports operate.
Agriculture is the leading industry in most counties of the nine states affected by the Flood of 1993 (See Table 2.1).
37 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION PRODUCTION DIFFERENCES OF FLOODPLAINS VS. OTHER AREAS Agricultural production in floodplains of the nine midwestern states affected by the flood is focused on commodity crops such as corn and soybeans.
Corn yields in well-drained floodplains uniformly average 15 percent higher than the state average in Missouri.
Production on portions of the floodplains, however, can be reduced by poor drainage.
Upland production yields are variable, depending on soil type and location.
The highest upland corn yields are 16 percent higher than the highest floodplain yields; however, high-yield upland areas are presently I full production.
Any additional production in upland areas would be in areas with yields averaging 14-26 percent lower than the average well-drained floodplain yield.
The area's 208 million cropland acres represent 32 percent of the nation's farm acreage, 35 percent of total agricultural sales, and almost 60 percent of total national corn, wheat, and soybean acreage.1 Combined production from Illinois and Iowa alone represent 33 percent of corn and 30 percent of soybean acreage in the United States, but dominant crops and yields vary by state throughout the region.
Floodplains comprise approximately 11 percent of total acreage affected by the 1993 flood and 66 percent of this acreage is in agricultural production.
2 Navigation on the Mississippi River was a primary factor in settlement of the valley.
The federal government began to support commercial navigation actively in 1824; first with 4-foot channels.
The navigation channel projects, authorized by Congress in the 1930s for the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, extended 9-foot draft navigation upstream to Minneapolis/St.
Paul and connected the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes with the Mississippi-Ohio-Missouri navigation systems (Figure 2.1) The upper Mississippi River 9-foot navigation project has converted the Mississippi River (St. Louis to Minneapolis/St.
Paul into a series of pools at low and normal flow (Figure 2.2).
Navigation dams, each consisting of a row of gates mounted between piers over a low sill, are used to maintain sufficient water depth for navigation.
During periods of high flow, the navigation gates are completely opened to allow passage of the flood flows.
Construction of the 29 lock and dam projects on the Mississippi River north of St. Louis was completed by 1950.
These locks are nearing the end of their economic life span and may soon start to require Navigation There are two types of navigation projects present in the Basin.
One, on the upper Mississippi River, is slack water navigation created and controlled by a system of locks and dams.
The other, open water navigation, is utilized on the Missouri River and middle Mississippi River.
Upper Mississippi River.
The upper Mississippi River navigation system provides a variety of uses: commercial transportation, recreation, environmental resources, water supplies for domestic and industrial use, and energy production.
The Water Resource Development Act of 1986 declared the upper Mississippi River system to be a nationally significant ecosystem and a nationally significant commercial navigation system.

expensive replacement.
Locks and dam 26 near Alton, Illinois, was replaced during the early 1980s at a cost of nearly $1 billion.
Below the southernmost lock, Lock 27 at Granite City, Illinois, navigation is maintained through placement of flow regulating structures such as wing dikes and by dredging that channelize, nar row, and deepen the river.
Maintenance of the upper Mississippi River navigation system requires periodic dredging at over 200 sites, removing an average of 9.5 million cubic yards of material annually.
Additionally, about 2,400 submergent and 700 emergent wing dikes are maintained to reduce main-channel sedimentation and 420 miles of bank line stabilization are maintained to prevent shoreline erosion.3 Illinois River.
Two construction projects have supported navigation activities on the Illinois River.
The first, the Chicago sanitary and Ship Canal, completed in 1900, diverted water from Lake Michigan into the Illinois River.
The second, a modern lock and dam system, similar to that in operation on the upper Mississippi River, consists of seven separate navigation locks.
This system was completed in 1965.
Missouri River.
In 1945 congress authorized a comprehensive navigation plan for the Missouri River system.
The result was a 9-foot channel navigation project to channelize and deepen the river from St. Louis upstream to Sioux City, Iowa.
Six multi-pur pose mainstream reservoirs, affecting over 900 river miles, were developed above Gavins Point Dam.
One pur pose was to provide a regulated release of water for downstream navigation.
Downstream of Gavins Point Dam, the river consists largely of a 735-mile navigation channel maintained with wing dikes, channel stabilization and other erosion and sedimentation control devices.
Annual water release for navigation is based upon available water supplies.
Navigation needs combined with winter releases for waste supply and hydropower demands obligate all available water during a normal year.
The navigation season on the Missouri River is limited to the ice-free season between April 1 and December 1.

Flood Damage Reduction A flood in 1927 affected millions of people throughout the Mississippi River Basin and demonstrated the inadequacy of the pattern of private flood damage reduction measures begun in 1879.
It became a milestone event leading to major changes in national floodplain management policy.

41 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION federal interest in the coordinated development and installation of flood damage reduction measures.
The primary method used to prevent damages in those early years was floodplain levees.
Starting in 1936 the USAE responsibilities were focused on major rivers and development of congressionally approved plans for reservoirs, levees, channelization, and diversions.
The method s used were those determined to be most cost effective for preventing flood damages.
The USACE has constructed 76 reservoirs in the upper Mississippi River Basin.
These control a drainage area of almost 370,000 square miles and contain a total flood storage volume of 40 million acre-feet of water.4 Fortynine are located in the Missouri River Basin where the USACE also operates 22 Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs for flood storage.
The majority of the reservoirs are operated to provide benefit s on the tributaries where they are located; some are operated to benefit the main stem rivers.
In addition to the reservoirs, the USACE has constructed or improved over 2,200 miles of levees for the protection of communities and agriculture in the upper Mississippi River Basin.
Though records on the federal levees are kept by the USACE (Table 2.2), there is no known inventory about the estimated 5800 miles of non-federal levees that are in the upper basin.
Table 2.2 Flood damage reduction-related activities of the SCS began nationally in 1944 with passage of PL 78-534 authorizing installation of upland treatment and flood damage reduction work selected watersheds.
The Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 (PL 83-566, refer red to herein as PL-566) expanded the SCS flood damage reduction program to the entire nation.
During the past 40 years, in the nine midwestern states affected by the Flood 1993, the SCS has planned and evaluated 316 watershed projects covering 40,000 sq.mi. (25.5 million acres).
Locally sponsored PL-566 projects have resulted in the installation of 2,964 reservoirs that influence the drainage of over 5 million upland acres, and 818 miles of channel work, 75 percent of which is located in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Illinois.
The SCS requires 75 percent of the land above a proposed reservoir site to be treated before construction.
It is estimated that PL-566 has resulted in soil and water conservation treatments on more than 3 million upland acres.
Although flood damage reduction reservoirs and levees reduce the risk of flooding, they do not eliminate it.
Given enough rainfall the flood damage reduction storage capacity of a reservoir can be exceeded and water will overtop the spillway.
Local flooding may then occur downstream; its extent will depend upon the condition of the stream when Levee Constructed or Improved by the USACE in the Upper Mississippi River Basin.

42 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION the overtopping occurs.
Throughout the basin, the Flood of 1993 exceeded the design capacity of many levees and the flood storage capacity of some reservoirs, flooding lands and property of persons who may have thought they were not at risk.
United States policy from the mid to the late 1800s has been to cede "overflow and swampy" lands to the states and to convert these lands to productive use.7 Substantial bottomland timber harvesting began with ar rival of pioneers, and by the 1930s, most wetlands had been converted to from natural to agricultural used and over 84 million acres nationwide had been included in regional enter prises known as drainage districts.
By the 1950s, forested wetlands had been reduced to 66.7 million acres, and by the mid-1970s in additional 6.5 million acres had disappeared.8 Between the mid-1950s and 1970s an average of 458,000 wetland acres were lost each year in the coterminous United States.
Agricultural development was responsible for 87 percent of the loss as wetlands were drained, filled, or otherwise converted to cropland.
Wetland Losses Wetlands occur in poorly drained soils and in areas where water is found at or near the ground surface.
Between 1780 and 1980 an estimated 53 percent of the nation's original 221 million acres of wetlands were drained.5 In the nine mid western states affected by flood 57 percent of the wetlands have been converted to other uses (Figure 2.3).
The SwampLand Acts of 1849, 1850, and 1860 resulted in the transfer of nearly 65 million acres of wetlands in 15 states from federal state administration for the pur pose of expediting their drainage.6 IMPACT AND EFFECT Development in the upper Mississippi River Basin for agriculture and other economic activity, flood damage reduction and navigation has greatly altered the original landscape.
The characteristics of Food events and the modification of the basin's natural resources reflect these changes.
measures such as conservation tillage, ter races, crop rotation, field border, sediment and debris basins, strip cropping, and permanent vegetation.
Such land use practices increase infiltration rates and help hold both water and soil in place.
It is estimated that 37 percent of the nation's croplands have adequate land treatment installed.z Upland Treatment and Runoff Upstream land use and land treatment affect downstream flow regimes of rivers and floodplains.
In considering floods and floodplain management, knowledge of where and how runoff occurs and which land practices can hold the rain where it falls for as long as possible become critical.
Proper management can greatly affect the quantity and quality of water and sediment transported by floodwaters.
Factors influencing the amount and velocity of run off include the amount and intensity of precipitation, soil type, land slope, available storage and land cover.
Proper management of agricultural lands requires use of protective cover or land conversation practices.
In the Midwest cropland erosion can be reduced by using 43 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Figure 2.3 Estimated Wetland Losses, 1780 Through 1980 Source: Based on GAO/RCED-92-79FS, Report fo November 1991.
44 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION The 1985 Food Security Act (1985 Farm Bill) mandated treatment of all highly erodible land (HEL) with conservation measures needed to reduce erosion.
The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) established by the Act was intended to encourage landowners to retire highly erodible and other environmentally fragile land from crop production for ten years.
In the upper Mississippi River Basin, over 200,000 CRP contracts were signed and 10.9 million acres were converted from cropland to grass or tree cover at a ten year cost of $11.3 billion.
This has r educed the average erosion rate from 18.6 tons per acre per year.
Assuming normal antecedent soil moisture conditions, CRT lands reduced runoff volumes by approximately 6-12 percent for the 1-year event, 3-8 percent for the 25-year event, and 2-4 percent for the 100-year event.10 In the case of the 1993 flood, soils were saturated and the quantity and intensity of rainfall so great that runoff reduction attributable to land treatment was minimal (Figure 2.4) Figure 2.4 Effects of the Food Security Act.
45 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION As CRP contracts begin to expire in September 1995, a large portion of enrolled acres is expected to revert to cereal, row-crop, and forage production.
Cur rent estimates are that 63 percent of land under contracts will revert to cropland and 23 percent to grazing and pastureland.
The remainder is expected to remain in permanent grass and trees and other miscellaneous uses.11 Conversion of these lands to cropland is expected to increase storm runoff even allowing for installation of proper conservation practices.
stream.
This intricate network of depressions slows runoff.
A different pattern of runoff occurs in the remainder of the basin.
There surface runoff flows through and open network of streams, with only minor areas of surface water storage available.
Historically, shallow wetlands and wet prairies, which occur red in these areas, served a similar, but less effective, function to that of potholes.
Topography has a direct impact on water movement and soil formation.
The upper Mississippi River Basin is characterized by two distinct kinds of landscape: open systems, which drain externally and closed systems where drainage is trapped within a common depository.
Due to the extended period of rain preceding the 1993 flood, the impacted area became completely saturated and surface depressions filled; therefore, storage available for additional runoff could only be found in the deep depressional areas located in the prairie pothole region of the Dakotas, Minnesota and Iowa.
Hydrologic mode studies of four watersheds that are representative of distinctly different upper Mississippi River Basin areas or ter rain units were completed in 1994.15 The modeled watersheds represent only 5 of the 70 terrain types in the basin and therefore information derived from these modes has limited applicability to assessing flood flow reductions basin-wide.
The following watersheds were selected for hydrologic studies: Boone River near Webster City, Iowa a Central Towa and MinnesotaTill Prairie with a relatively steep 380 sq.mi. watershed with well incised drainage.
White Creek near Dallas, Iowa--an Illinois and Iowa Deep Loess and Drift and Iowa and Missouri Heavy Till Plain with a relative steep 380-sq. mi. watershed with well incised drainage.
West Fork Cedar River near Finchford, Iowa--a Eastern Iowa and Missouri with Prairie with a flat 850 sq.mi.watershed but having well defined drainage system.
Conclusion: Upland watershed treatments such as conservation tillage practices and CRP land easements are effective in reducing upland runoff, especially for smaller storm events, for large events like the 1993 flood, upland treatments had little effect.
Wetlands and Flood Storage Pre-1850 historical records indicate that even prior to the clearing of wetland areas major floods occur red in the Mississippi River Basin.
As part of economic development in the Midwest a substantial percentage of agricultural lands were created by drainage of wetlands and hydric soils.
Hydic soils, good indicators of past and present wetland locations, total 10.4 percent of Mississippi and Missouri basin soils.12 The review Committee heard numerous times that flooding would have been reduced had more wetlands been available for rainfall and runoff storage.
An evaluation of the upper Mississippi River Basin's capacity to store rainfall runoff estimates that the soil profile has 10 times more storage capacity than above ground storage in depressional potholes.13 Because much of the basin was depleted and unable to store water from the rains of June and July.14 Surface depressions or potholes occur throughout the glacial landscapes of north central Iowa, east South Dakota, and North Dakota.
When these depressions fill, surface waters flow from pothole to pothole through an illdefined network, eventually finding an outlet to a surface Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 46 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Ã¯Â¿Â½ Redwood River Watershed above Redwood Falls, Minnesota -- a Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairie and Loess Uplands and Till Plain with both high relief and low relief pothole areas of a 700 sq.mi.watershed.
For the analysis all model runs used antecedent moisture condition II for the start of modeling conditions Condition II is defined as the average soil condition prior to the annual flood event.
For the 1993 flood antecedent conditions were condition III in most areas.
Condition III indicates near saturated soils prior to the storm and gives significantly higher runoff that antecedent II.
Because the model analysis used a lower antecedent moisture condition than was actually experienced in the 1993 flood, the peak discharge reductions resulting from the model analysis are greater than would have occur red.
In areas where opportunity exists, wetlands and small detention structures can aid in lowering peaks.
However, flood peak discharge reduction is dependent on the topography of the watershed, the percentage of the basin containing deep depressional storage, and the intensity and volume of the rainfall.
In the watersheds modeled the maximum reduction for floodplain wetlands was 6 percent of 25- and 100-year storm event.
Wetlands are more effective in upland areas with more deeply incised potholes, such as the Redwood River watershed.
Where reductions were 23 percent of the 1-year event, 11 percent of the 25-year event, and 10 percent of the 100-year event.
In areas of shallow depressions, such as the Boone River watershed, restored wetlands reduced peak discharge by 9 percent of 1-year event, 7 percent of the 25-year event, and 5 percent of the 100-year event.
With the installation of a combination of land treatment measures and restored wetlands in the watershed, the models indicate runoff reductions of 12 to 18 percent are possible for the 25-year or less event.
This indicates these practices could be effective for the smaller storm events.
Wetland restorations in the uplands could function much the same as small upland reservoirs.
It was shown more than three decades ago that small flood damage reductions dams are effective in the reach of stream immediately downstream but their effect diminishes rapidly with distance.
As far as a series of small headwater dams is concerned, they are essentially ineffective under conditions in which major floods occur on large rivers.16 A State of Illinois report concluded that for certain watersheds, peak flow decreases as wetland areas increase.
In very small watersheds (less than 100 sq.mi.), peak flowrates decreased by an average of 3.7 percent for each increase in wetland area equivalent to one percent of the area of the watershed.
Applicability of this report may be limited only to the study areas.
While wetlands may have some impact on peak flow in the smaller watersheds during smaller storms, their effects in larger watersheds during smaller storms, their effects in larger during larger events has not been sufficiently documented and needs further study.
Previous watershed evaluations, such as the study of Devils Lake in North Dakota (a closed basin), indicate reductions of peak flowrates up to 41 percent for 1 100-year storm.
These widely ranging results from the aforementioned studies demonstrate that alternative watershed practices produce varying degrees of success in reducing flood runoff rates depending (in addition to the magnitude and intensity of the rainfall and antecedent moisture conditions) on the percentage of the basin treated and basin topography.
Generally, as drainage areas increase, upland treatment measures, wetlands, and small detention structures have less effect in decreasing peak flowrates.
In short, land treatment and detention storage (upland wetlands) can play a role in reducing peak runoff in some watersheds but are not a panacea for solving flood problems.
Only a combination of upland and floodplain management practices can reduce floodplain damages in the future.
Conclusion: Upland wetlands restoration can be effective for smaller floods but diminishes in value as storage capacity is exceeded in larger floods such as the Flood of 1993.
Present evaluations of the effect that wetland restoration would have on peak flows for large floods on main rivers and tributaries are inconclusive.
47 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Flood-storage Reservoirs The 1993 flood demonstrated that dams and reservoirs, engineered and built to store and regulate floodwater discharge, could reduce flood damages.
All federally funded flood storage reservoirs operated as planned during the 1993 flood.
At some facilities, such as Tuttle Creek Reservoir (Kansas) and Coralville reservoir (Iowa), emergency spillway flows occur red when inflow volume exceeded reservoir storage capacity, the storage space allocated in a typical reservoir and effect of flood storage is depicted in Figure 2.5.
During the period of peak flooding (April 1 to August 1, 1993), the USACE reservoirs stored 22.2 million acre-feet of flood water.17 Approximately 18.7 million acre-feet were stored in the Missouri Basin, half of which was stored in the 6 main stem.
About 3.5 million acre-feet of water was stored in the Mississippi River Basin and an additional 1.1 million acrefeet were stored in 2,964 small PL-566 upland flood damage reduction reservoirs.
Flood damages reduction reservoirs effectively controlled excess runoff and reduced damages to downstream floodplains during the 1993 flood event.
The combined effect of the storage of flood waters in the federal flood damage-reduction reservoirs in the Missouri River basin reduced the average discharge of the Missouri River near it mouth, during the month of July, by 211,000 cfs.
This had the effect of lowering the peak stage of the Mississippi River at St. Louis by 5 feet.
Levees Federally constructed levees, in concert with upstream flood-storage reservoirs, protect many large urban areas from potentially significant damage.
For example, without levees or floodwalls, portions of low-lying areas in Rock Island and Moline, Illinois, and Kansas City would have been devastated.
At St. Louis the Mississippi River crested at 49.6 feet on the USGS gage, almost 20 feet above stage, yet that portion of the city protected by the large flood wall escaped inundation.
RESERVOIR OPERATIONS Flood control reservoirs temporarily store a part of the flood flow for later release so that peak downstream flows will be reduced.
Food-storage capacity is always located above sediment and multipurpose pool elevations.
Food damage reduction reservoirs have emergency spillways that allow safe passage of flows that exceed storage capacity.
All managed flood damage reduction reservoirs are operated pursuant to a water control management plan.
In no case will the peak discharge from the dam exceed that which would have occurred without the dam.
Missouri River reservoirs.
Most of the remainder was stored in tributary reservoirs of Kansas and Osage rivers.

Adaption 49 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Much of the speculation about the effect of levees on flood levels during the 1993 flood was based upon inferences drawn from comparisons between recent event data, obtained from systematically-measure d river flow (discharge) and river level (stage) records, and similar data for historical floods.
Such discussions fail to recognize that significant differences in data quality exist between the modern (after 1930) and the historic record.18 In addition, many other changes have occur red in the upper Mississippi River Basin which have created differences in flow regimes over time.
To ascertain the actual effect existing levees had on peak 1993 Mississippi and Missouri river flood stages, the UNET model, which analyzes unsteady state river flow condition,19 was applied to the river reaches where crosssectional data were available: (1) the Mississippi River between Hannibal, Missouri, and Cairo, Illinois, (2) the Missouri River between Hermann, Missouri, and the mouth at St. Louis, and (3) the Illinois River Between Meredosia , Illinois, and the mouth above St.Louis.
The analysis used flow data from 1993, 1986, and 1973 floods and developed water surface profiles resulting from the same flood flows without levees.
The model was calibrated and a range of possible floodplain ground covers was used.The analysis suggested that if all the levees (other than urban levees) were absent, the peak stage at St. Louis in 1993 would have been reduced by 2.5 feet, but still more than 17 feet above flood stage and almost 4 feet higher than the previous known maximum level recorded during the 1973 event.
This model scenario assumes the improbable condition of a totally open floodplain covered only with bare soil or short grass cover.
If one assumes existing levees would have constructed to contain all flows, peak stages at St. Louis would have been increased by 2.3 feet.
An independent model commissioned by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed that the overtopping and breaching of two levees downstream from St. Louis at Columbia and Harrisonville, Illinois, reduced peak stage at St. Louis by 1.6 feet.21 This analysis used steady-state model applied to a short stretch of the river and lends support to the UNET findings.
A physical model study conducted at the Waterway Experiment Station (WES) in 1979 by Foster and Allen22 showed that the removal of the trees between the river bank and levee along the middle Mississippi River between St. Louis and Cape Girardeau would lower the stage at St. Louis about 2.5 feet for the 1973 flood, which cor responds with the mathematical (UNET) model results for the fully open, treeless floodplain assumption.
Farther downstream along the middle Mississippi River, the UNET mode predicted that there would have been a sizeable local drop in river levels in the absence of levee under the most conducive flow scenario.
At Chester, Illinois, the stage of the Mississippi River during the 1993 flood would have been approximately 11 feet lower if the levees containing the river were removed.
But the floodplain would have been under water.
The mode predicted that there would be no stage reduction if the entire floodplain were covered dense forest or brush -- a scenario representing a least conducive flow condition.
It is expected that a typical floodplain without levees would contain a mix of uses and associated land covers such as sloughs, side channels, forested and non-forested wetlands and agriculture.
Conclusion: Levees did not cause the 1993 flood.
During large events such as occurred in 1993, levees have minor overall effects on floodstage, but may have significant localized effects.
Erosion and Sedimentation Upland erosion and the sedimentation in downstream areas are major causes of reduced water quality and habitat destruction in most midwestern rivers and streams.
Sedimentation in the backwaters of the upper Mississippi River is the most significant problem in that river.
In recent years, Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin have developed watershed management programs to reduce runoff and erosion.
Land use planning and land stewardship are key nonstructural factors in reducing runoff and downstream flooding.
50 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Significant floodplain erosion and deposition occur red during the 1993 flood, principally on floodplain agricultural lands along the Missouri River.
Preliminary analyses of aerial photography, satellite imagery, and historic Missouri River floodplain maps reveal that more than 90 percent of the areas affected by significant erosion and deposition are associated with breached levees situated in active, highenergy floodplain zones.23 Review of the history of levee failures in this area shows levees have been breached repeatedly at sites of natural river cutoffs or chutes in the past three decades.
Construction of levees across these high energy channels is a risky investment which has required repetitive repair.
In most cases where levees breached, scour holes, locally known as blow holes or blue holes, occur red.
These holes, typically 25 to 50 feet deep, are caused by scouring of alluvial soils underlying the levees and farm fields and are caused when the head of water exceeds the height of a levee or its ability to withstand water pressure, overtopping or breaching the levee and releasing river water through the constricted levee breach with velocities similar to that of a dam break flood wave.
This sudden release of energy scours tremendous volumes of materials creating both new aquatic and terrestrial habitat.
Erosional zones of scour and stripping can extend as far as one mile downstream from the larger breaches (Figure 2.6).
Locally constricted floodflows in breaches through railway embankments and in the vicinity of railroad and highway bridges act in a similar manner.
Comparison of the effects of the 1993 floods on the upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers shows that river reaches in broadly similar physiographic regions may respond very differently to floods.
The annual discharges of the upper Mississippi River are generally comparable to those of the Missouri River, but sediment yields of the Missouri average more than five times those of the Upper Mississippi.
Average slope of the lower Missouri River floodplain (upstream of St. Louis) is about twice that of the middle Mississippi River floodplain (downstream from St. Louis).
Levee breaches along the lower Missouri commonly resulted in high-velocity flows across its relatively nar row and relatively steep (high gradient) floodplain, contributing to extensive deep scour and thick sand deposition across agricultural lands located there.
In contrast, levee breaches along the middle Mississippi produced less intense erosion and sedimentation; impacts were largely limited to passive inundation of large bottomland tracts.
The Pick-Sloan plan authorized by Congress in 1944 called for the creation of a floodway from 3,000 to 5,000 feet wide between levees along the Missouri River from Sioux City, Iowa, to the mouth near St. Louis, Missouri.
The purpose of this floodway was to provide sufficient space for flood waters to pass and reduce potential damage to adjacent farmlands.
For a number of reasons, this plan was never implemented.
The Flood of 1993 demonstrated the need for some form of floodway to provide greater capacity to convey flood flows.
Implementation of any future flood damage reduction plan should recognize that in lieu of a standard setback distance, the floodway should coincide with the natural high-energy zone of the river, which commonly is wide in areas of large meanders and narrow in straighter portion of the river.
Conclusion: Levee location and height are factors in determining erosion and deposition in the floodplain.
There are certain locations where levees should not be constructed.
In these cases set-back levees might allow normal river functions.
Each situation needs to be evaluated on its own merits.
Navigation The Review Committee received numerous suggestions that the flood crest could be lowered significantly by opening navigation dam gates before the ar rival of flood waters.
Hydraulic investigations by the University of Iowa,24 and evaluations of the 1993 flood show that navigation dams cause slight, localized increases in 51 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Figure 2.6 Reach of the Missouri River Bottoms Showing "High Energy" Erosion and Deposition Zones.

Adapted from SAST data, 1994 52 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Flood height just upstream of a dam.
They do not cause increases in flood elevations for the entire Mississippi River System.
In the middle Mississippi (from St. Louis to the confluence with the Ohio River) and on the Missouri River, navigation channels have no locks and dams, and the dikes and revetments which are in place cause little or no restriction to flow. sloughs and wooded islands can be found.
In the lower end, immediately above each dam, wide open water lake-like areas occur (Figure 2.2).
While impoundment of the upper Mississippi River for slackwater navigation created a variety of backwater and side-channel habitats, these dams also slowed river currents, starting the ir reversible process of sedimentation.
Many backwater habitats are filling with sediments from the erosion of upland agricultural and developed lands.
Rock dikes and channel maintenance dredging also contribute to the problem.
Mississippi River backwaters shill provide critical fish production and nursery habitats, but may be lost to sedimentation and eutrophication within 60 yrs.25 Downstream from its confluence with the Missouri River, the upper Mississippi River takes on a very different character, similar to that of the Missouri (see Missouri River habitat description).
Forth-six species of Mississippi River fish, virtually all of which have been affected by flood damage reduction measures and navigation, are listed by basin states as rare, threatened, endangered, or a species of special concern.26 Missouri River.
Parts of the Missouri River were well known as a braided river with swift, muddy flows.
The historic floodplain was a ribbon of islands, chutes, oxbow lakes, backwaters, marshes, grasslands, and forests.
Sandbars and wooded islands dotted the channel.
Between 1879 and 1954, human actions and natural changes shortened the river by 45.6 miles, reduced river surface area by over 50,000 acres, reduced the number of islands from 161 (24,419 acres) to 18 (419 acres), and converted nearly 67,000 acres of river habitat from public to private ownership, most to agriculture.27 Nearly one-third of the Missouri River has been impounded, another one-third channelized, and the hydrologic cycle, including temporal flow volume and sediment transport, has been altered on the remainder.
The Missouri River formerly had peak run-off during two periods, March-April and June.
Prior to 1954 flushing flows, known as dominant discharge, occur red every 1.5 years.
The river was in a state of equilibrium; net sediment entering a reach replaced an equal amount leaving allowing for ample habitat Conclusion: Navigation dams and locks did not cause an increase in the stage heights of the 1993 flood.
Habitat Loss Fish and wildlife resources in the upper Mississippi River Basin have been significantly affected by the loss of wetlands and other ter restrial and aquatic habitats due to construction for navigation and flood damage reduction structures.
Upper Mississippi River.
The upper Mississippi River was originally a free-flowing, alluvial riverine environment with associated riparian habitats.
Construction of navigation control structures (rock dikes) and installation of the slackwater navigation dams have created habitat types substantially different from those found in a free-flowing alluvial river.
Habitat types within the upper Mississippi River slackwater navigation pools are created by coincident physical, water quality, and botanical characteristics.
River position, depth, water-surface area, stage and discharge, vegetation, riverbottom types, water quality, and the superimposed structural elements within the river define the various habitats.
Three distinct habitat zones occur in the slackwater navigation pools.
The upper end of each pool is like the original river although subject to exaggerated water level fluctuations from the upstream dam releases.
March development is limited.
In the middle portion of the pools, downstream impoundment backs water up and over the islands and old hay meadows, creating large areas of shallow water.
This section has the best marsh development, and some deep 53 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Figure 2.7 Changes in Channel Morphology Following the Addition of Navigation Dikes, Indian Cave Bend, Missouri River, North of Rulo, Nebraska.

Loss of sediment load let to channel degradation which contributed to the loss of off-channel habitat and further severed the river from its floodplain.
Since the early 1950s the Missouri River has thus been deprived of a floodplain in most reaches.
Water temperature, photoperiod, and run-off cues have been altered by reservoir releases for navigation and other purposes.28" Changes in basin and floodplain physiography and channel mor phology have reduced commercial fish harvest by more than 80 percent and are implicated in the demise of native species.
The Missouri River's natural riparian ecosystem has been nearly eliminated and presently consists of a discontinuous, single row of trees.
Missouri River floodplain forest coverage decreased from 76 percent in 1826 to 13 percent in 1972, while cultivated lands increased from 18 percent to 83 percent.

55 IMPACTS OF HUMAN INTERVENTION Thirty-four species of Missouri River Basin stream fish are listed by basin states as rare, threatened, endangered, or as species of special concern.29 The pallid sturgeon, piping plover, least tern, and bald eagle are all native Missouri River species listed as endangered by the U. S. Fish 
33 Burbot have been nearly extir pated, sauger have been greatly reduced, and blue catfish are rare.
The Master Water Control Manual for the six Missouri River main stem reservoirs is cur rently under review by the USACE.
Decisions made with regard to this manual are important to the future of the Missouri River ecosystem.
For example reservoir water releases could be adjusted to simulate natural hydrographs and, in combination with riparian land acquisition, be used to restore many of the river's natural functions including lowlevel flooding of riparian lands.
Illinois River.
Aquatic and ter restrial habitats of the Illinois River Valley have suffered a series of cataclysmic events since 1900: (1) permanent rise in water level from water diverted from Lake Michigan, (2) the draining of more than half of the 400,000 acre floodplain through the construction of levees and pumping stations, (3) an upsurge in untreated urban and industrial pollution during the 1920s, (4) the creation of a 9 ft. channel and its attendant navigation dams in the 1930s, and (5) an acceleration in sedimentation rates following World War II, apparently resulting from an increase in the amount of open row crops grown within the basin.34 As an example, in 1908, a 200-mile reach of the Illinois River produced 10% of the total U. S. catch of freshwater fish (employing 2,000 commercial fishermen and yielding 24 million lbs. of fish annually).
Commercial fish yield totaled about 178 lbs/ac of permenent water, but by the 1950s yield had dropped to 38 lbs/ac and by the 1970s to 4 lbs/ac, totaling 0.32% of the total U.S. freshwater harvest.
35 Conclusion: Alteration of Mississippi, Illinois and Missouri Rivers and floodplains has resulted in significant changes or losses of habitat.
The disruption of natural ecosystems has caused the destruction of many native species populations and has caused an increasing number to be listed as threatened or endangered.

The UNET Model is a computer program that solves unsteady state flow equations to describe floodflow conditions.
Unsteady state means that the depth of flow changes with both distance along the channel and with time .
The model uses a network approach to solving the unsteady state flow relationships.
UNET is a 1-dimensional model and assumes that the calculated velocity at a cross-section exists across the entire river.
The area behind levees are modeled as storage cells.
After calibration using flow data obser ved in the 1993, 1986, and 1973 flows with pre-flood conditions of levee development in the floodplain, the model analyzed the water surface profiles that would result from those same flood flows assuming levees were absent.
Under such a scenario, land use in most areas would be different than presently exists as would ground cover types.
Because the hydraulic roughness (resistance to flow) of the floodplain cross-section must be represented in the model, a range of possible ground cover types was used, from bare soil or shor t grass to dense forest or dense brush.
A floodplain absent of levees would likely have a mix of ground cover types ranging between and including these extremes.

58 Chapter 3 FUTURE FLOOD POTENTIAL After the 1965 flood, they told us this wouldn't happen again for another 100 years.
Midwestern mayor July 1993 This quote illustrates the lack of understanding by many individuals concerning flood potential.
Many people think of flooding only in relation to a flood of a 100-year magnitude.
They overlook the fact that although government regulators have selected the 100-year flood as a reasonable regulatory standard, it is not the only magnitude of flood that can occur.
Floods are random, variable events.
Through frequency analysis, hydrologists can characterize them as a 50-year flood, 100-year flood, or 500-year flood.
The Midwest flood of 1993 varied from less than a 50-year flood at St. Paul, Minnesota, to less than a 100-year flood at Lincoln, Nebraska,1 to over a 100-year flood at St. Louis, Missouri
.2 No one -especially those living at risk in floodplains -- should be misled into believing that a 100-year flood occurs only once in a century.
What happened in the Midwest in 1993 could happen again at any time! WHAT IS A 100-YEAR FLOOD EVENT? The American people have heard quite a bit recently about a 100-year flood.
What exactly is it? A 100-year flood has a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
It has a 26-percent chance of occur ring over the life of a 30-year mortgage, and a 63-percent chance of occurring over the next 100 years.
The terminology used to describe the 100-year frequency flood, 1-percent flood, 1-percent annual chance flood, and base flood, which all refer to the same event, are often used interchangeable.
Confusion can result because the 100-year flood is usually the only type people hear about, even though larger and smaller floods are likely to occur.
As commonly applied, the concepts of a 100-year flood and 100-year floodplain can be misleading.
Technically only the outer edge of a 100-year floodplain has a risk of one percent.
The risk rises for sites closer to a river, ocean or other water feature, and also at lower elevations, yet most people think of the entire area between the water body and the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain as subject to the same risk.3 Variation of risk is not usually shown on floodplain maps.
There are areas within the mapped 100-year floodplain that may flood more frequently and to greater depths than others.
Uncer tainties sur round 100-year discharges and elevations, and mapping 100-year floodplain boundaries is at best an imperfect science.
Estimates of the 100-year flood discharge (or flowrate) can be based on a range of techniques, and cur rent techniques provide estimates that could be off as much as 5 to 45 percent.4 Factors such as the size of the watershed, the availability and length of streamgaging records, and the level of detail of mapping for use in deter mining model parameters contribute to the uncertainty in a 100-year flood discharge estimate.
Flood discharges associated with 59 FUTURE FLOOD POTENTIAL infrequent events, such as the 500-year flood discharge, are more difficult to predict and have more uncertainty associated with them.
Even if a fairly accurate 100-year discharge is determined, it may subsequently change due to land-use changes in the watershed and natural and human changes to the channel and floodplain.
After determining a discharge rate, this figure is entered into a hydraulic model to determine the elevation of the 100-year flood.
Hydraulic models, depending upon the level of accuracy of information on topography, friction losses, and hydrology, can produce estimates of 100-year flood elevations within 0.5 to 2 feet.5 Once the elevation of the 100-year flood has been determined, the extent of the floodplain can be mapped.
Topographic maps vary in precision and level of detail.
The accuracy of the floodplain boundary line is influenced most strongly by the quality of the 100-year flood discharge estimate.
The next most significant factor is the quality of the topographic mapping.
Research suggests that the probable nationwide standard er ror for base (100year) flood elevation mapping is 23 percent of the base (100-year) flood depth.
This value, translated into an average depth, amounts to about 3 feet.6 Thus, the floodplain boundary line shown on a map is not absolute and structures located within several feet (vertically) of the 100-year floodplain are still at risk.
In flat areas, structures located within several hundred feet (horizontally) of the 100-year floodplain also may be at risk.
MARBLES AND FLOODS At one of the public meetings attended by the Review Committee, a young Missouri farmer provided a cor rect explanation of the possibility of experiencing a 100-year flood.
He described a bag full of 100 marbles with 99 clear marbles and one black marble.
Every time you pull one of those marbles out, and it's black, you've got a 100-year flood.
After each draw, you put all 100 marbles back in the bag and shake it up.
It's possible that you could pull the black one out two or even three times in a row.
To represent the uncertainty of estimating a 100-year flood, it's also possible that the bag could hold two or three black marbles.
STANDARD PROJECT FLOOD Another magnitude of flood that can occur is one that results from the standard project flood (SPF) discharge.
This event is not assigned a frequency or recurrence interval, although it is often used by hydrologic engineers to approximate the 0.2 percent annual chance (500-year) flood.
The SPF discharge in a river represents the flow that can be expected from the most severe combination of meteorologic and hydrologic conditions reasonable characteristic of the geographic region involved.
SPF discharges exclude extremely rare combinations.
The SPF procedure is used in lieu of the dischargefrequency approach because of the unreliability inherent in estimating large magnitude infrequent events from short record, or even regional, discharge-frequency analyses.
The SPF discharge is currently used for design of engineered structures which, if compromised, could result in catastrophic flooding.
The SPF discharge is generally used to determine the level of protection for urban population centers where there is great threat of loss of life and of damage to critical infrastructure.
60 FUTURE FLOOD POTENTIAL RESIDUAL RISK BEHIND LEVEES Risk exists in all areas within a floodplain -- both areas protected by channel modifications, dams, or levees and areas outside the 100-year floodplain.
Levees built to provide a 100-year level of protection modify the natural overflow boundary of the 100-year floodplain and the boundaries for lesser floods.
Individuals and businesses remaining in what was once the 100-year floodplain, are not required to carry flood insurance even though the chance of a flood greater than the 100-year flood occur ring in the next 30 years is about 1 in 4.
Uncertainties also sur round a levee's level of protection.
Engineers may account for discharge and elevation uncertainties in the design of levee by the use of freeboard -- the difference between the top of the levee and the design flood height.
Even though areas protected by levees are considered safe, the potential for catastrophic loss still exists.
If floodwaters overtop a levee, flooding in the protected area could reach depths equaling or exceeding the levee's height.
Higher levees reduce risk but could increase potential damage.
CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change could increase flood risk.
Although considerable uncertainty exists, climate change could bring about more-frequent and/or more intense floods.
Given that development in and near floodplains is expected to last considerable period of time and that the nation's ability to predict the magnitude and frequency of future events is still limited, it may be prudent to consider the potential effects of climate change when decisions are made (or revised) about the type and amount of development allowed in vulnerable areas.
In the absence of sufficient data, flexible and cautious policies are preferred.
U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment Preparing for an Uncertain Climate ---- Volume I FUTURE FLOODS Not every state and local government regulates storm water runoff, and the volume of runoff and flood peaks may increase in the future because of urbanization.
The streets, parking lots, gutter, drains, and storm sewers accompanying urbanization convey rainfall rapidly to stream channels.
Natural channels are often straightened, deepened of lined, transmitting flood waves downstream more quickly.
Storm waters can therefore accumulate downstream more quickly than in natural river systems and produce higher, shaper flood peaks.
Unless steps are taken to mitigate the impacts of urbanization, flood volumes and peaks will continue to increase.
61 FUTURE FLOOD POTENTIAL Current flood records are limited by their length.
As flood records for more years become available, cur rent estimates of flood discharge, volume, stage, and duration will change.
In the 1993 flood, out of more than 500 USGS gaging stations in the area of flooding streams,7 45 exceeded the 100-year discharge,8 but at least 450 did not.
Many people think that the entire upper Mississippi River Basin experienced a 500-year flood, when setimates indicated that only the research of the Mississippi River from Keithsburg, Illinois, to above St. Louis and the reach of the Missouri River from Rulo, Nebraska, to above Hermann, Missouri, endured such a flood.9 Since 1900, St. Louis has experienced large floods in 1903, 1909, 1927,1973, and 1993.
The communities in the Midwest that experienced a 10- to 50-year flood in 1993, may experience a 100- to 500-year flood in the near future.
There is no question that flooding is inevitable.
The open questions are when? Where? And how much? Conclusion: Floods equal to and greater than the flood of 1993 will continue to occur across the nation.
It is difficult to predict precisely when and on what rivers these large events will happen.

62 Part II A BLUEPRINT FOR THE FUTURE 63 64 Chapter 4 A VISION FOR THE FLOODPLAIN The Congress...declares that it is the continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and full till the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of American.
Section 101, National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ...it is the sense of Congress that flood control on navigable waters or their tributaries is a proper activity of the Federal Government in cooperation with the States, their political subdivisions, and localities thereof, for flood control purposes are in the interest of the general welfare; that the Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters of their tributaries, including watersheds thereof, for flood control purposes if the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs, and if the lives and social security of people are otherwise adversely affected.
Section 1, Flood Control Act of 1936 The United States, as it moves into 21st century, is at a crossroads in the use of its floodplains.
The nation may choose to use these flood-prone lands for the primary purpose of economic development, or it may take action to better balance their economic and environmental outputs.
Floodplain resources can be shared by human occupants and natural systems.
Over the last century, in the upper Mississippi River Basin, while human activities have produced significant economic and social benefits, some of these activities have placed both human and nature at risk.
Flood control works have allowed cities to grow in the face of periodic high waters.
Until the middle of this centur y, the nation did little to control the clearing of lands of the floodplains.
Subsequent increases in runoff generated the need for additional flood damage reduction activities.
Levees, built by both the federal government and private lawn owners, helped ag riculture flourish in the fer tile bottomland environment; however, the overtopping of these levees by floodwater created major economic losses.
Reser voirs, like levees, reduce the flood threat to many downstream communities, but the reduction in flood flows simultaneously creates incentives for many people to settle riverbanks and become subject to the impacts of the next major flood.
The promise of postflood suppor t from gover nment and private agencies may encourage people to continue occupying land at frequent risk of flooding.
65 VISION In recognition of this continuing vulnerability to flooding, watershed-focused programs are now emerging, and the United States has begun to move in a new direction.
Concern for the environment and sustainable development as well as recognition of the severe limits on federal spending and of funding opportunities lost in flood recovery speak clearly to the need for reexamining the nation's flood damage reduction strategy.
This reexamination must acknowledge that the cur rent state of floodplains reflects in part a succession of political decisions made at the national level.
Much of the floodcontrol effort of the last half-century in combination with other infrastructure development had major landdevelopment implications.
Many people moved to or remained in the floodplain with the understanding that the federal government was providing them flood protection.
Others saw upstream activity, over which they had no control, increasing their hazard.
As the nations seeks a new approach for floodplain management, it must not lose sight of the realities of the past.
Recognition in the early 1960's of the natural functions and resources of the floodplain -- habitat, scenic beauty, water filtration, storm buffer, groundwater recharge, and floodwater storage -- caused the nation to reconsider its policy of supporting wholesale conversation of natural areas to other uses.
Persistent flood losses during a half century of flood-control programs raise serious questions concerning the long-term efficiency of such programs.
A movement to reduce flood damages through nonstructural means, limiting unwise development of the floodplain and evacuating those at most risk, gradually has become a viable alternative to the construction of dams, levees, and floodwalls.
DEFINING THE VISION The National Commission on the Environment, a nonprofit group, proposes a concept of sustainable development to accomplish economic progress by protecting and restoring the quality of the natural environment, improving the quality of life for individuals, and broadening the prospects for future generations.1 Effective floodplain management embodies these very concepts by seeking to balance competing uses in a way that maximizes the net benefits to society.
What then should be the national vision for use of the floodplains? To assist in developing this vision, the Floodplain Management Review Committee reviewed the literature on early and recent goals of the nation's floodplain management.
Committee members consulted with interest groups at national, regional, and local levels and discussed possible goals with citizens affected by the flood of 1993.
The governors of the 9 flood-affected states in the Midwest provided their vision of future floodplain activity.
The Review Committee looked to the National Assessment and the accompanying Action Agenda prepared by the Federal Interagency Floodplain Management Task Force definition.2 Based on this input, the Review Committee proposes strategic and operational goals for the nation's future use of its floodplains and management of that use: Strategic Goals Reduce the vulnerability of the nation to the dangers and damages that result from floods.
Reduce the vulnerability to urban areas, industry and agriculture, when such reduction is justified and reasonable; avoid new development when reduction is not appropriate.
As appropriate, move those cur rently at risk from the floodplain.
Strive to eliminate threats to life, property, and the environment, and to the mental health 66 VISION and well being of floodplain occupants.
Ensure the viability of critical infrastructure and the regional economy.
Implement consistent, equitable, flexible, cost-shared, and efficient floodplain management by improving the National Flood Insurance Program, federal-state-tribal-localindividual relationships, and the conduct of mitigation and disaster planning and execution.
Ensure federal-state-triballocal-individual collaboration and accountability in a bottom-up, shared planning and decisionmaking process.
Reduce the cost to the nation of flood damages.
Share the risk among all levels of government and among floodaffected individuals.
Preserve and enhance the natural resources and functions of floodplains.
Treat the floodplain as part of a physical and biological system that includes the floodplain within the larger contact of its watershed.
Seek to identify and enhance the cultural, historic, and aesthetic values of floodplains.
Where appropriate, restore and enhance bottomland and related upland habitat and flood storage.
Use existing government and private programs to acquire, over time, environmental interest in these lands from willing sellers.
Ensure the consideration of social and environmental factors in all actions relating to the floodplain.
Operational Goals Capitalize on technology to provide information required to manage the floodplain.
Provide timely and accurate information to assists in identifying hazards, determining impacts of proposed actions, and developing a temporal and spatial basis for long-term action strategies.
Leverage the strength of geographic information systems .
Streamline the floodplain management process.
FLOODPLAIN OF THE FUTURE If this vision was implemented, how would the floodplain of the future appear and how would it be managed? Human activity in the floor plain would continue (Figure 4.1) but with a clear recognition that any such activity would be subject to the residual risk of flooding and assumption of the costs of this risk by those sponsoring the activity, Determining future activities would depend on historical settlement, on a balancing of the economic, social, and environmental impacts of an activity together with a recognition of its place in the hydrologic and hydraulic regime of the river basin and what physical impacts its existence has on other segments of that basin.
Urban centers whose existence depends on a river for commerce or whose locational advantage is tied historically to a floor plain would be protected from the ravages of devastating floods by means of levees, floodwalls, upstream reservoirs, or floor water storage in managed upland and floodplain natural areas.
Sections of communities with frequently flooded businesses or homes would become river-focused parks and recreation areas as former occupants relocated to safer areas on higher ground.
In areas outside of these highly protected communities, where land elevation provided natural protection from floods, state and local officials would control new construction by requiring it to be at elevations well out of harm's way.
Those who were at risk in low-lying areas would be relocated, over time, to other areas.
Higher land in these alluvial areas would continue to produce rich harvests.
Outside of the urban areas, industry would protect its own facilities against major floods..
Critical infrastructure, such as water and wastewater treatment plants, power plants, and major highways and bridges would either elevated out of the flood's reach or protected against its ravages.
Much of the infrastructure, as well as the homes, businesses, and agricultural activities located behind lower levees, would be insured against flooding through full participation in commercial or federally supported insurance programs.
67 VISION At the upstream end of many levees, federally built watercontrol structures would permit river waters to keep sloughs wet though out the year maintaining and restoring aquatic habitat with resultant benefits for fisheries, waterfowl, and other wildlife.
Levees would be modified to provide for controlled overtopping in the event of major high waters, eliminating the catastrophic failures that have occurred in the past.
Some bottomland owners behind modified levees would choose to convert from crops to alternative crops or silviculture or to return their lands to a natural state under federal or state easements.
Owners would base their decisions on private and government analyses that found their land too wet for farming or in a location where levee protection was impossible to maintain.
Upland of the floodplain, federal-state-tribal-local programs to improve the treatment of lands, control new runoff, and restore wetlands, would reduce the flows during frequent floods and shave the peaks off larger events.
Both commercial and recreational vessels would continue to ply the river's waters, operating in a navigation system that would enhance river line ecosystems through waterlevel adjustments and control.
Modifications in rivercontrol structures would continue to increase fisheries and wildlife habitat.
Floodplain activity would guided by broad-based plans of federal-state-tribal-local governments working together as partners in a streamlined floodplain management effort.
Operation of the waterway and the levee systems, with their attendant environmental components, would be focused in a single agency that would collaborate with other interested agencies.
Levees along main stem rivers and principal tributaries would be maintained on a costshared basis by federal and state governments and local levee boards.
Decisions concerning activities in and near the water would be assessed using computer models to indicate the effects of such actions on other regions of the river basin.
Forecasts of river conditions would reflect the availability of basin-wide data and the rapid processing of these data.
Use of high technology remote sensing platforms and data-filled geographic information systems would provide highly accurate information on which to base key decisions for both planning and crisis management.
A New Approach Through most of the past two centuries, the nation's approach to floodplain management has focused on reducing flood impacts through structural means.
Floodplain management has been flood control.
In the 19th century and the first half of this century, the debate was whether or not a levees-only policy should be pursued.
Only in the last 30 years has the nation moved to increase the use of nonstructural approaches.
To achieve the goals of floodplain management, the nation must adopt a new approach -- one that takes full advantage of all methods available to reduce vulnerabilities to damages and, in parallel, to protect and enhance the natural resources and functions of the floodplain.
Translated into actions this approach, espoused in the draft 1994 Unified National Program, would achieve floodplain management through: Minimizing the impact of those risks when they cannot be avoided; Mitigating the impacts of damages when they occur; and Accomplishing the above in a manner that concurrently protects and enhances the natural environment.
The citizens of the nation bear a responsibility to exercise good judgement in their use of the floodplain and to share in the costs of their judgements.
Under this approach, state and local governments serve as the principal managers of the land.
The federal government provides support for state and local floodplain management, establishes broad national goals, and, by its own actions, sets an example.
Federal actions will continue given the interstate nature of water and the related impact of all riverine activity on these waters, the ever-present potential for catastrophic floods, and the federal government's longstanding commitment to flood-control activities as being in the interest of the general welfare.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Avoiding the risks of the floodplain; 68 VISION Figure 4.1 A Typical Reach of a 21st Century Floodplain.
69 VISION Reducing the Vulnerability of the Nation to Flood Damages Individuals and their investments in the floodplain will always be at risk.
Though it is impossible to remove the risk completely and remain in the floodplain, it is possible to reduce the degree of risk.
One solution is to evacuate floodplains and move people and their public and private investments out of harm's way.
This is not always a viable or desirable solution.
Techniques that either modify the susceptibility to flood damage and disr uption or modify the extent of the flooding may be more reasonable for cases in which evacuation is not feasible.
The new vision seeks to reduce the vulnerability whose floodplain residents and activities whose continuing presence in the floodplain makes economic, social, and environmental sense.
The lessons of the flood of 1993 are clear.
The United States should not continue to tolerate the loss of life and the damage to cites, rural communities, and farms caused by major flooding, nor should the nation car ry the burden of massive federal flood disaster relief costs that cur rent policies generate each time a major flood occurs.
Even with a large infusion of federal funds, private donations, and volunteer assistance, the 9-state area still has not returned to normal.
Individuals, communities, and agricultural sector will experience the long-term effects of the flood for years.
Many of these damages could be avoided through vulnerability reduction measures.
This chapter addresses the vulnerability reduction goals that the Review Committee seeks to achieve with the new vision.
Subsequent chapters will address, given the experiences of 1993, the strategies for achieving these goals.
Defining the Risk Against what magnitude of flooding should damage reduction programs be focused? The answer depends on the social, environmental, and economic assets of the flood-prone area.
This will be reflected by the use being made of land, as well as the amount of human activity and critical infrastructure located in the area.
Risk of damage or loss from flooding is greatest where human life and property are concentrated in highly populated areas on the floodplain.
For any years following the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1936, the federal government focused its efforts on protecting communities at risk from the largest flood they could expect to encounter.
Over time, with limited federal monies available for flood damage reduction pur poses, selection of this high level of protection came to be driven more by benefit-cost analyses.
Communities with little at economic risk received less protection that those with more.
Today many cities and towns are able to see major floods move by with minimal effect.
Others could not survive a lesser event without experiencing major trauma.
Had the 1993 flood been centered slightly to the north, several urban centers would have been inundated.
Given the social and economic consequences of such flooding in affected communities floodplain management activities need to focus on reducing the vulnerability of population concentrations to the most significant flood event expected to occur.
Reducing the vulnerability of communities, where appropriate, to the discharge associated with standard project flood (SPF) provides a greater reduction in residual risk than is provided by using the 1 percent annual chance (100-year) flood discharge.
The SPF serves as a practicable expression of the discharge to be considered in evaluating alternatives to reduce the vulnerability of activities associated with communities where large population and high-value property are involved.
In most cases the SPF approximates the 0.2 percent chance (500year) discharge.3 70 VISION Recommendation 4.1: Reduce the vulnerability of population centers to damages from the standard project flood discharge.
The identification of a target flood does not represent a call for new levees or floodwalls.
In fact, given this target discharge, floodplain managers would develop a strategy for evaluating vulnerability reduction considering all of the nonstructural and structural approaches available.
Planning for the future may move a community to first seek funding for mitigation activities such as relocation or elevation.
Availability of land in the watershed or in the floodplain may result in upstream storage or riverine floodways being considered better approaches.
When other approaches have been reviewed, higher or upgraded levees or floodwalls might also be considered.
The costs and benefits of each approach would determine whether the vulnerability would be eliminated, reduced, or the status quo maintained.
Those that, if rendered unserviceable, would impose significant hardship on the public, or Those that, if flooded, would pose a threat to public health, public safety, and/or the environment.
Critical infrastructure could include, on a situationdependent basis, municipal drinking water facilities, stations, major highways bridges, major passenger and freight railroads, critical access roads running through or over floodplains, major air ports, hospitals and related medical care facilities, electricity generating plants, and facilities that generate, store, or dispose of hazardous, toxic, or radioactive materials.
For many of these facilities, such as roads, the element of flood duration must be considered in determining the applicability of the definition.
A road out for five hours may not be critical, but one out for three months might be.
The only road to a county hospital might be critical under any circumstances.
Where feasible, critical infrastructure should be located outside the floodplain.
Critical infrastructure, which must be situated in the floodplain, should be evaluated for protection against the SPF discharge.
This issue is not new.
Floodplain Management Guidelines for implementing Executive Order (EO) 11988, issued by the Water Resources Council in February 1978, require that critical high-risk activities be protected at a minimum against the 0.2 percent annual chance (500-year) flood.
They also provide planners assistance in determining whether infrastructure should be considered critical.4 In 1982, a National Academy of Science panel concur red and recommended that critical infrastructure be protected against, at a minimum, the 0.2 percent annual chance flood.5 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Critical Infrastructure The risk of imposing severe hardship on the public or endangering public health and safety arises when infrastructure critical to maintaining the wellbeing of a community, region or nation is damaged.
This is especially true in floods of long duration, such as the one that occur red in the Midwest in 1993.
For example, when the city of Quincy, Illinois, lost both of its crossings over the Mississippi River, it faced the situation of having no open bridge across the river between Iowa and St. Louis, Missouri, for over two months.
People were put out of work, local businesses were isolated from their market areas, and the local economy was disrupted.
Vulnerability of Other Areas Recommendation 4.2: Reduce the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to damage from the standard project flood discharge.
Critical infrastructure can be defined as structures, facilities, and installations of the following type and function: If the goal of floodplain management is to reduce the vulnerability of population centers and critical infrastructure to damages from an SPF discharge, what should it be for areas that do not fall into these categories? While extending an SPF goal to all areas might seem equitable to many, such an action is neither physically, economically, environmentally, nor socially feasible.
The strategy for damage reduction 71 VISION and the target flood against which the strategy is based must be determined on a case-by-case basis using modern planning techniques and methods of analysis.
In the long term, much human habitation and related businesses might move to higher ground leaving only agriculture, silviculture, and natural use behind existing levees.
Where such an approach is not feasible or desirable and structural solutions appear appropriate, the hard facts of benefit-cost analysis normally will preclude using the SPF discharge as a basis for federally supported increases in protection.
The level of protection provided these areas would be determined considering social and environmental values as well as the economic benefits and costs.
Depending on the mix of population, infrastructure industry, and agriculture, the level of protection will vary.
funds for any efforts to stem the rising tide of flood losses.
Many states and local governments have developed and car ried out floodplain management efforts that both reduced flood damages and enhanced the natural functions of the floodplain; but in car rying out these programs they were hampered by the diversity that hindered efficient floodplain management.
The dominant federal role in funding flood damage reduction and recovery activities limited the incentive for many state and local governments, businesses, and private citizens to share responsibility for making wise decisions concerning floodplain activity.
Now is the time to: Share responsibility and accountability for accomplishing floodplain management among all levels of government and with the citizens of the nation.
Organize the federal government and its programs to provide the support and tool necessary to carry out effective floodplain management.
Succeeding chapters detail how the nation should organize for successful floodplain management and then, by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of programs already in existence, reduce the vulnerability of the nation to flood damages in the years ahead.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sharing the Challenge -Government, Business, Citizen Since passage of the flood control act of 1936, the federal government has for the most part, dominated the nation's flood control efforts and as a result the nation's floodplain management activity.
Structural programs needed for flood damage reduction were also the principal sources of ENDNOTES 1.

The Economics Advisor y Group strongly disagrees with the establishment of the standard project flood discharge as any form of a reference point, believing that the level of protection provided should be determined only by appropriate project evaluation.
The Review Committee believes that there are sound engineering reasons to establish a target for vulnerability reduction and an understanding of the problems associated with passing the target flood discharge .
Determination of the level of protection should result from appropriate benefit-cost analysis.

The Unified National Program was intended to correct this...that program has not succeeded...the Unified national Program is neither unified nor national.
In several respects if falls short of achieving the goals set out for it by the Congress and previous administrations.
Gilbert whit, et al.
Actin Agenda for Managing the Nation's' Foodplain March 1992 The test of how well floodplain management activities are being carried out is in what happens at the level of individual farms, households, and local communities.1 The 1993 Midwest flooding illustrates where local, state and nationa; efforts succeeded and failed.
Progress has been short of what is desirable or possible or of what was anticipated when cur rent policies and activities were initiated.2 The collective floodplain management efforts of federal, state, tribal and local governments, individuals, and the private sector must be improved.
Together they can use the regionally and nationally significant assets of watersheds and associated floodplains to reduce risk, achieve economic efficiency, and enhance natural resources and functions.
The cur rent floodplain management infrastructure has the capability and the responsibility to influence floodplain development and recovery from floods.
At issue is the appropriate distribution of responsibilities across and creation of accountability for governments and individuals.
73 ORGANIZING FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT FOR SUCCESS DEFINE FEDERAL-STATE-TRIBAL-LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS AND RESPONSIBILITIES The strengths fo the federal government -- nationwide experience; ability to examine issues from a national, inter-state and systems perspective; and multi-disciplinary technical expertise -- should guide strategic decisions regarding its obligations and duties.
Since the Water Resources Council ceased operations in 1981, however, activities of the federal government have offered little leadership or guidance in resolving interstate wasteresource issues.
Management of the nation's water resources is provided by several agencies.
Yet water resource issues are inextricably linked and accomplishedment of agency mandates requires coordination and collaboration among agencies.
The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 required reports to Congress analyzing the implementation of cur rent programs and recommending actions needed to achieve a unified program of planning and action at all levels of government to reduce flood losses and losses of floodplain natural values.3 Despite these Unified National Program for Floodplain Management reports, the United States, in practice, has no unified national program for floodplain management.4 This stems in part from ambiguity in national goals.5 If limited resources of money and people are to be utilized effectively, the vision articulated in this Report needs to be accepted and adopted by the populace and assimulated into all levels of government.
A major component of floodplain management is land-use control, which is the sole responsibility of state, tribal, and local entities.
The local process for land use and construction decisions (i.e., what, where and how to build) is supplemented in some states by state floodplain permit programs.
The federal responsibility rests with providing leadership, technical information, data, and advice to assist the states in their pursuit of sound floodplain management.
The federal government is also a partner with states, tribes, and communities in funding floodplain management activities.
Where the federal government is contributing finds to protect local communities, however, there is a compelling interest that the finds do not spur increased development in vulnerable locations and that local jurisdictions assume greater responsibility in their land use planning to not increase potential losses.
The federal government should not undertake actions that lower the incentive for those in the floodplain to avoid risk because they know the federal government will provide compensation for damages resulting from the risk (see Chapter 14).
The floes while promoting and assuring interstate commerce, national econimic development including a viable agriculture industry, and national environmental quality including the enhancement of the quality of the human environment.
Congress established the federal interest in flood damage reduction.6 This interest complements the fundamental state, tribal, and local interest in flood damage reduction.
Action 5.1: Enact a national Floodplain Management Act to define governmental responsibilities, strengthen federal-state coordination and assure accountability.
The Administration should propose enactment of a Floodplain Management Act to declare a national policy and goals for floodplain management.
These should reflect the vision articulated in Chapter 4 and move the nation toward implementation of a new floodplain management vision that: Reduces vulnerability to flooding by avoiding of flood risk through watershed planning, buyout of structures in the floodplain, and mitigation; Reduces vulnerability to flooding by modifying flood risk or protecting against floods by minimizing risk to existing population centers (such as cities), protecting existingcritical infrastructure, and protecting the nation from flood-related releases of hazardous materials; and Recognizes that floods will continue to occur but that the residual risk in floodplains can be reduced by insuring against flood loss and rebuilding properly when flood losses occur.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 74 ORGANIZING FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT FOR SUCCESS The purpose of the Act should be to provide incentives including funding for state and local entities to develop and implement floodplain management plans and increase their accountability for actions in the floodplain.
This should be achieved by assigning primary responsibility for floodplain management to states and providing federal guidance and technical and financial assistance to them for development and implementation of floodplain management programs meeting minimum federal standards.
The act should authorize funds to supplement state efforts to build and institute effective floodplain management programs.
Participation in on-going, non-disaster flood damage reduction and mitigation activities could be withheld from those states that do not conduct floodplain management planning.
To support local planning and emphasize state leadership, the Act should require that federal activities affecting floodplains be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with federally approved state programs.
The fundamental components of the proposed Floodplain Management Act are found in Appendix D. ...there needs to be a fundamental change in the federal flood protection role.
This new role must be to facilitate and to assist state and local government in the implementation of these multi-objective programs.
Doug Plasencia, P.E. Chair, Association of State Floodplain Managers Testimony before Congress, October 27, 1993 IMPROVE FEDERAL COORDINATION, EFFICIENCY AND FEDERALSTATE-TRIBAL PLANNING The 1965 federal Water Resource Planning Act established the U.S. Water Resources Council (WRC).7 However, the WRC ceased operations in the early 1980s when funding was discontinued.
Lost with the WRC funding was its ability to provide interagency coordination, technology transfer, and data and information services.
Deficiencies inheret in the original WRC which established a command-and-control, top-down approach to achieve consistency in federal water resources activities should not be repeated.8 Nevertheless, the WRC provided an avenue to bring together federal agencies to address water resources issues, in general, and floodplain management, in particular.
The Midwest Flood of 1993 illustrates the need to move toward the unified nation program of floodplain management that the nation has sought since, at least, 1968.
Some federal agancies and states, numerous organizations and individuals noted to the Review Committee the continued need to revive the WRC or some WRC-type of organization to provide a coordination function.
Many examples demonstrate why a WRC, composed of department and agency heads, is needed to provide policylevel coordination of cross-cutting issues of floodplain management and other water resource issues: 75 Federal agencies continue to fail to comply with the spirit and letter of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, by locating or funding nonfloodplain dependent activities in floodplains putting federal investments at considerable risk (this issue is further discissed below); The shortcomings of and opportunities for increasing the effectiveness of floodplain management identified by the Federal Interagency Floodplain Management task Force in 1992 in its Floodplain Management in the United States: An Assessment Report have not been acted upon.
No entity exhists to act upon those recommendations.
The Unified National Program is neither unified nor national -- it does not adequately integrate either the numerous program aimms that have been set forth or the efforts of those charged with implementing them.
There is no central direction for the Unified National Program.9 A minimal staff would facilitate operations of the Council and would prepare, based on input form federal agencies and states, items for discussion or action by the Council.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Human Services and the Chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
The Secretary of the Interior, as the Chair of the WRC, should restaff the Council.
A small staff and budget to support pursuit of the Council's mandate is suggested.
Appendix I provides additional details about this proposal.
The 1965 federal Water Resource Planning Act also authorized creation of federal-state-tribe basin commissions and authorized financila assistance to statestribes for water planning.10 The individual basin commissions produced comprehesive, coordinated plans for water and related land resources that were advisory to federal, state, tribal and local authorities.
The basin commissions established pusuant to the Act were abolished, along with federal funding, in 1981.11 While several interstate organizations evolved to fill, in part, the gap left by the demise of the basin commissions, federal participation is limited to non-voting membership.
A mechanism is needed to facilitate enhanced federal presence among continuing participation with these groups.12 Basin commissions provide a means of preserving and enhancing the state and local attention to floodplain management as well as broader water and natural resource issues, while providing a mechanism to involve or enroll appropriate federal agencies in state and local floodplain management activities.
Because watersheds and associated ecosystems do not coincide with, nor do water resources and environmental protection problems respect, political boundaries, a vechicle is needed to integrate federal-multi-jurisdictional examination of issues and solutions.
This basis for formation of basin commissions remains valid.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Action 5.2: Revitalize the Water Resources Council.
Immediate revitalization of the WRC would launch and promote cooperation among federal agencies and the states-tribes.
The WRC would, among other things, serve to align federal floodplain management goals with other broad national goals; provide a single point of focus to assist coordination and resolution of interstate water resource management issues; serve as an innovative planning and technology center, including intergovernmental data gatehering and dissemination activities; and facilitate resoulution of federal agency issues.
The Secretary of the Interior, as designated chairwoman of the WRC, should request that the Administrator of the EPA and the Director tof the FEMA become full-time participants on the Council.
Other full-time members, as established by the 1965 federal Water Resources Planning Act, are the secretaries of Army; Agriculture; Commerce; Housing and Urban Development (HUD); and, Helath and Action 5.3: Reestablish basin commissions in a revised form reflecting current needs.
The president should reestablish basin commissions to provide a forum for coordinaated federal and state planning.
Basin commissions are not needed everywhere.
Basin commissions would be formed in consultation with the governors of states for those areas where the governors determine that interstate or federal-state coordination of several activities was needed or appropriate.
The states, in consultation with the WRC, would define the geographical 76 ORGANIZING FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT FOR SUCCESS extent of each proposed basin commission.
Each basin commission would serve as the principal agency for the coordination of federal, state-tribe, interstate, local and non-governmental plans for their designated areas and would indertake other activities pursuant to Title II of the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965.
Their focus should be results oriented and their process collaborative.
Their charters should look beyond traditional water and flood management challenges to allow the commsiisions to address regional issues of biodiversity conservation, water quality, sustainable development, and other environmental goals.
Each basin commission would be co-chaired by a state and federal representative and would operate with a limited staff of four to five professionals.
While many federal agencies would participate on the commissions, that voice could be limited to increase state significance and responsibility in addressing land-use planning issues.
The basin commissions would use federal and state agencies, working within exhisting programs and structures to realize commission responsibilities.
Actual staffing requirements, therefore, would be small.
Public participation and comment should be vital aspects of their functions.
The above changes are proposed to address criticisms of the original basin commissions.
Funding of Figure 5.1 Proposed Institutional Framework for Water Resource Council, River Basin Commissions, and Federal Agencies.
77 ORGANIZING FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT FOR SUCCESS the commissions would be shared by federal and state governments.
It is anticipated that no increase in costs to state will occur for those states cur rently participating in river basin associations; however, the federal government would have to contribute some funding.13 Appendix I describes in greater detail the Review Committee's concept of revived basin commissions.
FEDERAL ACTIONS IN THE FLOODPLAIN -- SETTING AN EXAMPLE In 1977 with issuance of Executive Order (EO)11988, Floodplain Management, Presudent Carter raised federal agency attention to issues of floodplain use.14 With time, however, it has become apparent that some federal agencies either are unaware of or misunderstand the requirements fo the EO and either build or support building in floodplains.
Under the EO, federal agencies must technical expertise beyond the capacity of a single reviewer, and often requires consultation with FEMA or USACE.
The EO applies to all feseral agency activities including the acquisition, management, and disposition of lands and facilities.
It covers federally undertaken, financed, or assisted construction and improvements and federal activities and programs affecting land use.
Thise include but are not limited to water and related land resources planning, regulatio
