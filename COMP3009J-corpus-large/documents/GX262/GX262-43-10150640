Geological Survey (2001) THE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF PENNSYLVANIA This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Geological Survey and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.
In 2001, the estimated value1 of nonfuel mineral production for Pennsylvania was $1.27 billion, based upon preliminary U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data.
This was about a 2% increase from that of 2000.2 For the sixth consecutive year, the State was 11th in the Nation in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which Pennsylvania accounted for more than 3% of the U.S. total.
(Data for industrial sand and gravel and tripoli have been withheld from table 1 to protect company proprietary data, resulting in total values that are less than the actual totals for those years.)
1 The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending upon the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 2001 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of August 2002 and are expected to change.
For some mineral commodities, such as construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement, estimates are updated periodically.
To obtain the most current information, please contact the appropriate USGS mineral commodity specialist.
Specialist contact information may be retrieved over the Internet at URL http: //minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/contacts/comdir.html; alternatively, specialists' names and telephone numbers may be obtained by calling USGS information at (703) 648-4000 or by calling the USGS Earth Science Information Center at 1-888-ASK-USGS (275-8747).
All Mineral Industry Surveys--mineral commodity, State, and country--also may be retrieved over the Internet at URL http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals.
2 Values, percentage calculations, and rankings for 2000 may differ from the Minerals Yearbook, Area Reports: Domestic 2000, Volume II, owing to the revision of preliminary 2000 to final 2000 data.
Data for 2001 are preliminary and are expected to change; related rankings may also change.
In 2001, Pennsylvania continued to be among the Nation's leading States that produce crushed stone, cement (portland and masonry), and lime (descending order of value); these commodities accounted for nearly 90% of the State's total nonfuel mineral production value.
Construction sand and gravel, Pennsylvania's other major nonfuel mineral, accounted for most of the remaining 10%.
In 2000, an increase in the production and value of crushed stone, up $35 million, accounted for nearly all of the increase in the State's nonfuel minerals economy.
Common clay was also up slightly.
This was offset by a combined total of about $11 million by decreases in the values of cement (portland and masonry) and construction sand and gravel.
Smaller decreases also occurred in dimension stone and lime (table 1).
Based upon USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the 50 States in 2001, Pennsylvania remained second in crushed stone, third in portland cement, fourth of 4 States that produce tripoli, sixth in lime and masonry cement, and rose to eighth from ninth in dimension stone.
Additionally, significant quantities of construction sand and gravel, industrial sand and gravel, and common clays were produced in the State (descending order of value).
Pennsylvania is exclusively an industrial mineral- and coalproducing State; metals that were produced in the State in 2001 were processed from materials acquired from foreign and other domestic sources.
Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the Nation (third in 2000) in the production of raw steel, with an output of 5.22 million metric tons of raw steel, as reported by the American Iron and Steel Institute.
