Additionally, the Council was created to advise the governor and legislature on issues of importance to the Asian Pacific community.
In the past two years, staff created, imp lemented, and participated in programs that focused on the following objectives: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increase involvement of Asian Pacific people in the making of public policy; Initiate and carry legislation that was responsive to the needs of the Asian Pacific community; Broker relationships and create bridges between mainstream institutions, service/community based organizations, and individuals; Promote and commemorate Asian Pacific Heritage Month; Stimulate the Asian Pacific community's participation in cultural and community-wide events; and Serve as a resource people could look to for leadership and vision on issues confronting people of Asian Pacific descent.
Issues Confronting the Community Overhauling governmental reform in welfare, education, and immigratio n has led the Council and the community to seek innovative ways to meet the needs of an ever changing and growing community.
Education, particularly in kindergarten to 12th grades, remains an area where efforts need to continue and progress made.
Crime and violence within the community continues to increase and negatively impact the community's sense of well being and security.
Issues involving community development, both economically and politically, need to be addressed.
Objectives for the Next Biennium In serving the Asian Pacific community, the Council is deeply aware that the community is very diverse with differing needs that must be met in different fashions.
The Council will continue to forge stronger ties and collaborations with existing partners as well as be aggressive in seeking new ones to assist in its work.
In the next biennium, the Council will work on creating and influencing public policy as well as securing partners and resources in the public and private sectors for mental health services and programs, violence prevention, economic self-sufficiency, K-12 education, and community development needs.
Additionally, a top priority will be to work with the community to get them involved and active in the public policy making arena.
SECTION I: STATEMENTS A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN Expansion with Greater Accountability It is with great pleasure that the Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans presents this Biennial Report for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 to the Governor and members of the state legislature.
I want to thank everyone who was involved in the initiatives and the work outlined in this report.
Without the support and active participation of all involved, the past two years would not have been as successful as they were.
I have been the chair of the Council for the past three years and in that time the Council has challenged itself to identify issues of importance to the community and diligently work on behalf of the community's interest.
In the past two years, Council members, who are appointed by the governor, and the staff have worked hard to ensure that Asian Pacific people are included and informed as well as respected and valued as citizens of this state.
In the 1996 Legislative Session, significant changes were made to the Council's enabling statute that better defined the role and responsibilities of the Council.
Some of the changes include: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Kept the Council membership at 19 with no more than one member from each ethnic group; Exempted the Council from its Sunset Provision, which would have ended the life of Council in June 1996; Made the term Asian Pacific to include any person whose ethnic heritage is from any country in Asia east of and including Afghanistan and the Pacific Islands; and Created a new mandate for the Council to assist recent immigrants in their adoption into the culture and to promote the study of English as a Second Language.
Currently, we are in the process of devising a strategic plan for the Council that will carry us forward into the 21st Century.
We are assessing our strengths and areas where we can better serve the community.
In this report, we have outlined what the Council has accomplished in the last biennium, identified current is sues and concerns, and laid out a plan of action that will guide the Council's work and effort for the next two years.
Our success is dependent on the active involvement of every community member.
We look forward to serving and to working with you to ens ure the successful outcome of shared objectives and visions.
Adeel Lari A MESSAGE FROM THE E XECUTIVE DIRECTOR Commitment to Community The staff of the Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans and I are very pleased to present this Biennial Report for fiscal years 1997 and 1998.
The report offers a snap shot of the Council's programs, activities, and objectives for the past two years.
This report celebrates the efforts and progress the Council and the State of Minnesota have made in the past two years to work on behalf and for the Asian Pacific community.
At the same time, this report provides a critique and evaluation of needs in the Asian Pacific community that have not been addressed and of the work that needs to be done.
We firmly believe that all Minnesotans can and should be able to obtain fair and equal access to the state's programs and services which range from education to employment, health care to housing.
The Council takes seriously its mandate to serve Asian Pacific Minnesotans in the following ways: assist in their incorporation into the governmental and policy making process; help them gain better access to state government services; ensure that their talents and resources are used and promoted; and act as a bridge between them and non-Asian Pacific peoples.
In the past two years, staff created, implemented, and participated in programs that demonstrated our commitment to serving the community.
Overhauling governmental reform in welfare, education, and immigration has led the Council and the community to seek innovative ways to meet the needs of an ever changing and growing community.
And yet while there has been many challenges to face there has been tremendous successes to celebrate and share.
The details of those activities are included in this report.
We have and continue to develop partnerships with other state agencies, community organizations, private industries, and local and county governments to incorporate Asian Pacific Minnesotans into the social, educational, economic, and political structures of the state.
This unified collaboration has provided for positive working relationships that will prepare us to meet the needs and challenges of the Asian Pacific community in the next century.
The Council staff and I look forward to another biennium of working with the community to ensure that Minnesota's future is strong and inclusive of all its citizens.

It often did so in partnership or collaboration with non-profit organizations, businesses, college and universities, and city and county governmental agencies throughout the state of Minnesota.
Immediately below is a list of the Council's primary areas of focus over the last two years.
Following this is a more detailed summary of each area.
Areas of Primary Focus Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Increased involvement of Asian Pacific people in the making of public policy Carried legislation that was responsive to the needs of the Asian Pacific community Brokered relationships and created bridges between mainstream institutions, service/community based organizations, and individuals Promoted and commemorated Asian Pacific Heritage Month Stimulated the Asian Pacific community's participation in cultural and community-wide event Served as a resource people could look to f or leadership and vision on issues confronting people of Asian Pacific descent NCREASED INVOLVEMENT OF ASIAN IN THE MAKING OF PUBLIC POLICY Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ I.
I P ACIFIC P EOPLE Community Forums Community Forums are designed to increase the involvement of Asian Pacific people in the public policy process through the sharing and collection of information between the Council and the community.
Issues are raised and solutions are offered.
The Forums has helped the Council stay in touch with the issues and need of the community as well as to shape the priorities and objectives on which to work.
16 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans Mountain Lake, MN May 22, 1998 Mountain Lake, a small community located between Windom and Mankato, has grown to include about fifty Lao families.
The Council met with community leaders, school principals, a local physician, and county extension workers to discuss the successes and challenges they faced in adapting rural institutions to rapid cultural and social changes.
These exchanges continue to enrich our understanding of issues confronting smaller API communities and enhance our ability to advocate on their behalf.
Worthington, MN May 21, 1998 In the first of two meetings, a dialogue was held with human resource personnel, educators, and University of Minnesota Extension and Health Care service providers.
The Council also hosted a forum for Asian Pacific immigrants.
Audience members were mostly Lao.
They spoke about the ongoing needs and concerns of refugees who relocated to the Worthington area.
Many spoke of how the clo sing of the Campbell Soup Company has caused problems for families in search of a safe, economically stable way of life.
Others described the difficulty of understanding the health care system, thus limiting their ability to gain access to basic health care for themselves and their families.
Rochester, MN May 18, 1998 The Council met with the mayor, city employees, community organizations, families, and individuals to share information on available services and programs in the Rochester area.
The Counc il also visited three schools in the Rochester area that have substantial numbers of Asian Pacific youth.
Duluth, MN May 8, 1998 The Council hosted a forum with the members of the Asian Pacific community at the University of Minnesota - Duluth campus.
Participants expressed concerns with intergenerational conflict, education, and economic self-sufficiency.
Council staff used this opportunity to brief those in attendance about recent legislation that would impact their lives (i.e. graduation standard, welfare reform, and child welfare laws.)
Staff also visited with ESL students at an area high school.
Moorhead, MN May 6, 1998 The objective of the Moorhead trip was to learn about the Asian Pacific community residing in Moorhead, educate it about the Council's work, and discuss ways in which the Council State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 17 could serve the community legislatively and otherwise.
Much of the dialogue centered around difficulties in receiving legal immigrant services.
Rochester, MN April 30, 1998 Due to repeated acts of racial violence committed against Southeast Asian hunters and campers in the Rochester and Olmsted County area, the Department of Natural Resources, local authorities, landowners and Southeast Asian communities convened at the Olmsted County Public Works office.
The group brainstormed solutions that might ease tensions surrounding racial issues and hunting practices.
Warroad, MN November 1996 A sizable Lao community has developed in this small town near the Canadian border.
The community can trace its forma tion back to the risks taken by one person who moved to the town for employment reasons, found success, and then spread the word to family and friends.
Many of the families have created their own niche in the local economy and now own their own homes.
Despite this success, they are bothered by the racism they encounter in their workplaces, with the police, and amongst immigration officials.
Issue Forums Issue Forums are designed to select an issue that is deeply impacting the Asian Pacific community, have a dialogue about it, and solicit input on how to address the issue.
Issue Forums have proved to be very successful in mobilizing community action and to formulating policy around a particular issue.
Immigration Rally State Capitol, St. Paul, MN April 17, 1998 The Council partnered with the Chicano Latino Affairs Council and the Council on Black Minnesotans, along with various non-profit organizations, to plan an immigration rally at the State Capital.
The rally's objective was to alert federal legislators of the harmful repercussions of the immigration laws they recently passed.
Family reunification and deportation issues were of primary concern to the public.
In the Asian Pacific community, juveniles who have committed an aggravated felony, and are not U.S. citizens, can be detain by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and ultimately subject to deportation.
Education Briefing St. Paul, MN January 29, 1998 18 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans The Council convened a meeting to brief the community on the changes of education laws and to appraise community members of existing resources and tools designed for academic achievement -- compensatory aid, graduation standards, and the diversity rule.

Health Care Reform St. Paul, MN January 6, 1998 Dennis Hayashi, Department of Health and Human Services' Civil Rights Division, presented an overview of the Federal DHHS Asian Pacific Islander Health Initiative.
The forum was well attended by community members as well as by professionals in the health and social services area.
Participants had an opportunity to share with Mr. Hayashi health concerns and issues they were working on, thus providing the federal government with input from the Asian Pacific people from the Midwest.
Mr. Hayashi also toured three local community clinics the Community University Health Care Clinic (CUHCC), the Center for Asian Pacific Islanders (CAPI), and Wilder Southeast Asian Social Adjustment Program.
He met with staff, physicians, and clients.

State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 19 II.
C ARRIED LEGISLATION THAT WAS RESPONSIVE TO THE OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC COMMUNITY N EEDS The primary legislative focus of this biennium was education, welfare reform, crime, economic development, health, and youth development.
Listed below are some highlights of the legislation on which the Council worked.
The Council strives to monitor and provide input into the creation and deliberation of public policy whenever possible.
Welfare Reform The Council has been instrumental in providing input into welfare reform policy in three major ways.
First, it has monitored the implementation of the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP), and other Welfare to Work programs.
Secondly, the Council has been serving as a member of the Department of Human Services Welfare to Work liaison group.
Lastly, the Council has and continues to use public hearings as a means to brief legislators on new issues surrounding welfare reform.
January 30, 1997 The Council along with community organizations, the Chicano Latino Affairs Council and the Immigration Task Force initiated and organized a welfare reform public hearing that took place in Christ Lutheran Church of St. Paul.
Legislators from the House and Senate Health and Human Services committees were present to hear the testimony of families impacted by welfare changes.
These testimonies were instrumental in the framing of the Minnesota Grown Program and a citizenship and literacy initiative led by the Department of Children, Families and Learning.
February 3, 1998 Building upon the successful experience of the hearing from the previous year, another community hearing was organized in connection with the Senate's Health and Huma n Services Committee.
This time the hearing focused on issues resulting from the implementation of welfare reform, for example, food shortages, hunger and starvation, and the need for a food program to replace the potential loss of Federal food stamp assistance.
During the hearing, we were able to visually demonstrate the meager amount of food that could be purchased from the dollar amount allocated to families.
Additionally, community members testified that families were finding it difficult to buy cult urally appropriate foods under the Minnesota Grown program.
For example, rice, a main dietary staple for Asian families was not covered.
As a result of the testimonies, legislation was passed to restore the state's usage of the federal food stamp program which made the purchasing of food more flexible.
20 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans Minnesota Grown The Council was actively involved in exploring alternatives to providing food assistance to families facing cuts in food stamps.
The Council had meetings with Senators Morse and Lourey in the summer of 1997 to implement the Minnesota Grown program.
Our work on the Minnesota Grown program led to a press and media event in an Asian grocery store on University Avenue to publicize the Minnesota Grown MGSFP vouchers and eligible products in the fall of 1997.
Citizenship Legislation Due to the severity of federal welfare and immigration legislation impacting the immigrant and refugee population, the Council partnered with Ramsey County, the Immigration and Naturalization Services, the International Institute of Minnesota, and other social service agencies to draft legislation that resulted in the creation of a state-wide citizenship/adult literacy initiative.
The goal of the initiative is to educate immigrants and refugees about the naturalization process and to assist them in obtaining naturalization.
Education K-12 Legislation During the 1997 legislative session, Governor Arne Carlson invited the four communities of color to participate in the final stages of the K-12 Bill.
The gover nor wanted feedback from the community regarding the voucher proposal in the K-12 bill.
In a short amount of time, the Council invited community members and community educators to participate as part of a committee task force to work on the issue of private school vouchers as tax credit.
After gathering input from the Asian Pacific community the Council concluded that vouchers were not in the best interest of the Asian Pacific community.
The Council recommended to the Governor and legislators to support charter schools and site based management.
Gary Suddeth Bill The Council worked with various community based organizations to create a best practice clearinghouse for the data collection of best methods for educating students of color.
The legislation was designed to increase the educational achievement of student of color in kindergarten through twelfth grades.
A part of this legislation created the establishment of Quality Intervention Teams and the establishment of community liaisons to work with the Teams and parents.
State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 21 Economic Empowerment Community Development Centers (CDC) Legislation The Council worked with the Department of Trade and Economic Development and other Community Development Councils to pass legislation for the creation of two Asian Pacific CDC's in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.
Employment Bill The Council worked in support of the Chicano Latino Affairs Council's effort to provide employees whose language is other than English with information about their basic employment rights.
The bill sought to provide employees with language appropriate information of the terms and conditions of employment.
The Governor vetoed the bill.
III.
ROKERED RELATIONSHIPS AND CREATED BRIDGES BETWEEN MAINSTREAM INSTITUTIONS, SERVICE/COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND INDIVIDUALS B The Council has partnered with many individuals and organizations to be more effective in our work.
Below is a partial listing and description of the partnerships we have formed and the work that we are doing together.
Refugee Immigrant Community Effort In light of the threat of welfare and food stamp cuts, non-profit organizations such as Second Food Harvest, the Center for Asian Pacific Islanders, the Urban Coalition and members of the Food First Coalition joined together with the Council to form a food campaign.
From this coalition, the Refugee Immigrant Community Effort (R.I.C.E.) project was established to educate and unite the Asian Pacific community around issues of food.
The project's goal is to educate the community about welfare reform, and provide information about where they can obtain resources and access food.
Another focus of the project is to heighten the public and law makers' awareness of hunger in the community.
The R.I.C.E. project is the first of its kind to focus on stocking food shelves with culturally appropriate food for the Asian Pacific community.
Gambling Treatment Training In a study the Council conducted on problem gambling in the Asian Pacific community, the Council found that a vast majority of problem gamblers were not seeking treatment.
For those that were in treatment, the treatment was not successful or culturally competent.
As a result, the Council worked with the Minnesota Council on Compulsive Gambling to obtain five scholarships for Asian Pacific persons to obtain training in compulsive gambling treatment.
Five 22 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans staff members from community based organizations were trained.
Three were Cambodian, one Lao, and one Hmong.
The trained individuals are now treating compulsive gamblers.
Twin Cities Project on the Media and the Public The objective of the project is to improve news coverage by working with the media to set fair and accurate reporting standards.
The Council provided input in the advisory and working group committees.
The Council also assisted with outreach to the various Asian Pacific communities to increase community participation during the community forum sessions.
The community forums and the committee work produced the "Twin Cities Media Project Report" which was released in Spring 1998.
Equal Employment Opportunities The Council worked with the Department of Employee Relations' Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity to ensure that employment opportunities with the state are accessible to all Minnesotans.
The Council has also served as a liaison to the Statewide Affirmative Action Council and is a member on the Governor's Affirmative Action Council.
Economic Development The Council partnered with the Neighborhood Development Corporation (NDC) to promote its Special Outreach loan programs to the Asian Pacific community.
The NDC received funding from the Department of Labor and Industries to assist businesses with capital investment and renovations expenses.
Special focus was centered on first and second year businesses in St. Paul's University Avenue/Frogtown area.
The Council serves on the advisory council of the Empowering of New American Business Leaders (ENABLE) program.

State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 29 SECTION III: ISSUES AND CONCERNS FACING THE ASIAN PACIFIC COMMUNITY S ECTION III: ISSUES AND CONCERNS FACING THE ASIAN PACIFIC COMMUNITY Five Key Issues Confronting the Community The Asian Pacific American Experience Telling the story of who Minnesotans are includes telling the story of Asian Pacific people.
Although Asian Pacific Americans have been in Minnesota for over three generations - their history in this state spans over 150 years - there is little attention or acknowledgement of their history, diversity, and contributions.
Currently, there are approximately 121,000 Asian Pacific people residing in Minnesota.
It is the fastest growing minority group and is projected to grow to 229,000 by the year 2025.
The Asian Pacific population in the United States is 9.7 million and is growing at a breathtaking pace due in part to changes in immigration laws.
Three fourths of Asian Pacific Americans (74%) speak a language other than English at home, either alone or in addition to English.
This rapid expansion of the Asian Pacific American population in recent decades has created a remarkable ethnic diversification.
In 1970, 96% of Asian Pacific Americans were Japanese, Filipino or Chinese.
As the 21st Century approaches these three groups now number just over 50 percent of Asian Pacific Americans.
Scholars of the Asian Pacific American experience often describe and separate the experience into "three waves of immigration."
The first wave spans from 1849, the start of the California "Gold Rush" to 1924 when the Immigration Act of 1924 was passed.
Approximately one million people entered the United States during this period.
The law then cut off immigration from Asian countries.
After a hiatus of some forty years, a second wave numbering about three and a half million people immigrated to the United States.
The third wave of Asian American people to enter the United States occurred in the years following the Vietnam War when immigration laws were removed as a response to the genocide of Southeast Asians who were friendly to democratic ideas and cause.
There are two contrasting stereotypes applied to the Asian Pacific community.
One is of prosperity and the other is of poverty.
Too often Asian Pacific Americans are viewed as a model minority.
Data such as the following support this image.
A new population bulletin, published June 1998, describes the Asian Pacific American population as active in politics `many hold high elected office.'
High levels of educational attainment, occupational status, and household incomes negate the idea of Asians as a disadvantaged minority, which is often the case with refugees from Asian Pacific countries.
The Asian Pacific community in Minnesota is vastly diverse.
As a result of the "three waves of immigration," Minnesota's Asian Pacific population generally falls into one of three socio 32 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans economic classification: Established second and third generation Asian Americans that tend to be relatively well established in the community as the result of good education and hard work.
More recently arrived immigrants from around the world, often first generation; well educated, in search of improved economic opportunity for themselves and their family.
Most recently arrived refugees from war torn areas of Southeast Asia; some fleeing political and religious persecution, many struggling in their new homeland.
In describing problems in the community as a whole, we need to preface these concerns by stating that the needs of each individual and community varies.
Each community has its share of accomplishments, of contributions made to the economic strength and cultural richness of this state, and is shaped by its previous patterns of immigration history.
Regardless of the differing needs of each segment of the population, there are many issues that unite the community.
They are education, economic self-sufficiency, culture and identity, and political empowerment.
Welfare Reform and Self-Sufficiency In monitoring the development and implementation of federally mandated welfare reform in Minnesota, the Council has worked with many community based organizations to help ensure that families on public assistance take maximum advantage of the opportunities being offered under the Minnesota Investment in Families (MFIP).
While early results of welfare reform has been positive, the Council is hearing from the community many of the barriers and obstacles they face in going through the new system.
The Council wants all members of the community to be economically self-sufficient.
For this to happen, an assessment of the system needs to be examined.
What is working well needs to continue.
The system needs to be flexible enough so that it can adjust itself to meet the needs of the people it seeks to serve.
Primary welfare recipients from the Asian Pacific community are Southeast Asian refugees who have been in the United States less than twenty years.
Southeast Asian immigrants face multiple barriers to achieving self-sufficiency including limited or no English language skills, little or no formal education, and, non-transferable job skills.
As a result of this, 60% or more (depending on the particular population) are on some form of public assistance.
An estimated 60,000 Hmong live in the state with more than 85% settled in the Twin Cities, approximately 23,000 Vietnamese live in Minnesota with 90% living in the Twin Cities, and nearly 7,500 Cambodians now reside in the Twin Cities.
Upon analysis of the problems, the Council predicted there would be major problems in the service delivery area as county welfare offices scrambled to provide adequate services for their non-English speaking clients.
The problems range from the lack of communication between state and county case workers and Asian Pacific clients, inadequate staffed transitional job training services, high case loads on financial caseworkers and employment counselors, State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 33 starvation and hunger, inadequately supervised kids, mental health, and depression.
The process has added to the hardships, confusion, anxiety, and stress of many of the last waves of refugees.
The Southeast Asian MFIP Services Collaborative formed in response to the urgent need to help those who will be effected by welfare reform.
Collaborative partners include: Hmong American Partnership, Lao Family Community, United Cambodian Association of Minnesota, Women's Association of Hmong and Lao, and, Vietnamese Social Services.
They provide Southeast Asian immigrants with the functional work place English and soft skills needed to secure employment.
One problem with this MFIP solution is that the entry-level positions available to those with limited language and job skills seldom pay more than minimum wage.
Southeast Asian immigrants, particularly the Hmong, are often married with an average of six children.
With both heads of the household working in entry level positions, their combined salaries do not lift the family out of their need for MFIP cash assistance.
Often an eldest child must work to ensure the family can make ends meet, and even then they struggle
.This is particularly alarming since the MFIP reimbursements expire in five-year time limits.
Another problem is that the Collaborative currently receives funding to serve a total of 750 participants but receive 1,046 referrals from the county.
Additional support is needed to make up the funding deficit created by additional referrals.
Education In the seven county metro area public school districts, there are 28,918 (6.8%) Asian Pacific students out of 422,590 students.
One out of four students in the St. Paul Public Schools is Asian Pacific American.
Although a large number of Asian Pacific students are excelling in the classroom (as measured by standardize testing) significant numbers of Asian Pacific students are at a high risk for academic failure.
Although schools should be a nurturing, learning environment for all children, mo st schools are ill equipped to cope with the language needs of children who speak a language other than English at home and with racial, cultural, and socioeconomic diversity in the classroom.
(AAPIP Report 1997).
Academic Achievement In the 1998 Minnesota Basic Standard Test for 8th grade, only 33 percent of Asian Pacific American students passed the reading test and only 38 percent passed the Math test.
The breakdown by ethnicity is as follows: Results of the 1998 Minnesota Basic Standard Test % Passing Reading Test Hmong 23.4 Lao 27.3 Vietnamese 39.1 34 % Passing Math Test 31.6 35.2 48.0 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans Total Asian Pacific 33 Department of Children, Families and Learning.

The percentage of Minnesota 7th through 12th grade dropouts rose from 3.2% in 1991 to 3.7% in 1997.
The annual drop out rate increased for all minority populations.
Although the high school completion data shows percentages for Asian students are higher than other minorities, they are still 13 points below whites.
During 1991-92 through 1993-4, Asian Pacific American drop out rate increased from 9.5 percent to 14.6 per cent.

Class of 1996 Graduate on time 79% Continue in school 10% Drop out 11% Source: Minnesota Planning: Minnesota Milestones The statistics are alarming, leaving the Asian Pacific community wondering what can be done to help improve student achievement.
There are many co-factors as to why students are not doing well: inadequate language and literacy programs; lack of meaningful parental involvement by the schools; lack of Asian Pacific teachers and staff; and lack of curricula appropriate to educate multicultural, multilingual student populations.
Among Asian Pacific people, 73.3 percent speak a language other than English, compared with 13.8 percent of the total U.S. population.
Schools lack the commitment, teachers, materials, or understanding of second language acquisition to make the promise of educational access real for non-English speaking students.
Most Asian Pacific students are receiving only a limited amount of bilingual education, taking them away from their class and the lear ning that is occurring there.
Parents of students who are in bilingual education classes have limited understanding of the premise of bilingual education and often are dissatisfied with the results.
Among teachers and educators concerned with second la nguage acquisition, they believe that developing strong State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 35 literacy in one's native language first is an effective and appropriate strategy to promote both English fluency and academic achievement.
Additionally, parents relate to the school system with respect and deference as they did in their former countries and so do not actively participate in the decision making in the schools.
Some parents do not have educational backgrounds and may not know how to interact with school officials or help their children in the school process.
Many parents do not speak or know how to write in English.
The Need to Hire More Asian Pacific Teachers and Staff Schools expect parents to be involved and engaged in their children's education without providing them the resources, support, or tools necessary to do so.
In schools with a large minority population, there is not a designated community liaison fluent in the languages of the children enrolled in the schools to work with parents.
Too often this role is placed as addit ional duties on the already over burdened English as a Second Language (ESL) and Learners of English Program teachers.
In Minnesota, minorities comprised 7.9 % of the population in 1996, yet the number of teachers was comparatively small.
More than 60% of the students in the St. Paul Public School are students of color and yet only 10% of the staff are minorities.
School districts need to hire and retain more teachers of color.
A continuing shortage of minority college students majoring in education has slowed progress in rectifying this problem.
Percentage of public school teachers who are American, American Indian or Hispanic.

Schools with a large number of minority parents needs to hire community liaisons that can speak to parents and bridge the cultural gap.
A community liaison can communicate to parents whether their children are doing well or attending school classes regularly.
During open house and parent/teacher conferences there needs to be interpreters to speak and show parents around the school.
A school can improve its outreach to parents by creating a climate that is welcoming to parents of different ethnic heritage.
This need to be manifested visibly in the school environment with pictures, signs and symbols drawn from the cultures of all the children attending that school.
Orientation sessions about the school and the experience that their children will undergo should be made available for parents to attend.
36 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans Juvenile Crime and Children Failing in Schools There is a direct correlation between crime being committed by juveniles and failing test scores.
The schools have not developed satisfactory communication with parents and have not provided a safe place for children.
Many of the issues of juvenile crime can be traced to lack of adequate school and family collaborations and community liaisons, failure to track truancies, and lack of holistic approaches to address the failing test scores of students of color.
In an Urban Coalition report released this summer, students of color reported that they were more often the victims of violent behavior at school.
Twenty percent of Chicano/Latino 9th graders reported that someone had threatened or injured them with a weapon (e.g. gun, knife, club) on school property in the past year, compared to 15% for American Indian, 14% for African American, 11% Asian Pacific American and 7% White.
For some students, worries about safety at school became so serious they sometimes did not go to school.
Health and Mental Health There are increasingly disturbing reports and indications of serious mental health problems in the Asian Pacific community in Minnesota, ranging from depression and suicide among the elderly, stress and domestic violence in families, to depression, anti-social behavior and suicide among Asian adolescents.
Many of these cases indicate that they are the result of the long term side effects of too rapid a cultural adjustment, loss of family, decreased social status on the part of leaders and educated professionals, cultural shock and a profound sense of isolation.
Minnesota health providers, practitioners, and educators are faced daily with issues that challenge their cultural competency.
People from different ethnic backgrounds hold different beliefs about death and dying, childcare, support systems, health, and mental health beliefs.
The Council is in a unique role to provide input into the understanding of these issues, and serve as a broker between the Asian Pacific community and mainstream institutions.
While commonalties exist among cultural groups, there are differences that are significantly correlated with cultural values.
Mental health issues range from short-term cultural adjustment of refugees to chemical abuse and mental illness.
Refugees were expected to jump into American life with no thought to their mental well being and need for sensitive treatment to cope with the trauma and atrocities many had recently faced.
The number of refugees suffering fr om post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not documented.
The Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) estimate that there are over ten thousand people in Minnesota who are survivors of torture, yet very little is being done to treat them.
For many in the Southeast Asian community, the concept of "mental health" is unknown.
People fear being diagnosed as "crazy" and are reluctant to seek help, particularly from mainstream providers.
On a community level, talking about mental health problems is still difficult.
There is a need to focus on the basic problems of violence experienced during the trip to the United States, anxiety concerning resettlement, loneliness and isolation, and loss of State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 37 cultural values.
Parents' feelings that they have lost control over their children are common, and some children react to ineffective parenting by joining gangs or committing crimes.
Mental health issues make joining the workforce even more difficult for many refugees.
There are only handfuls of Twin Cities Rule 29 clinics or hospital based mental health clinics that have the capacity to serve refugee populations.
These clinics struggle to hire and retain bilingual staff who can work with members of their communities.
Most of these staff persons are not reimbursable by insurance companies, since many do not have master's degrees and are not licensed.
They frequently must carry very large caseloads, and are not able to do the outreach necessary to make their services more accessible to those who truly need them.
The Asian Pacific community is very concerned about problem gambling.
Part of the problem is the lack of treatment programs culturally appropriate to serving the Asian Pacific community.
The money currently appropriated by the State for the treatment of compulsive gambling funds six major hospital treatment centers and does not serve problem gamblers in the Asian Pacific community.
There is a need for bi-lingual counselors to work with problem gamblers.
Violence Prevention Domestic Violence The Minnesota Department of Corrections estimates that at least 132,000 domestic assaults occur annually based on police reports submitted in the state of Minnesota.
The U.S. Department of Justice has found that the tangible and intangible costs of one domestic assault are $9,350 per assault.
Thus, the cost of domestic assault in Minnesota is $1,234,200,000.
Domestic violence is the single greatest cause of injury to women.
Approximately 25% of all homicides are a result of domestic violence.
In one study of spouse homicide, police had received one prior call from the victim in 85% of the cases.
The police had received five prior calls in 50% of the cases.
Husbands and wives kill each other with almost equal frequency.
However, wives are 7 times more likely to have killed in self-defense.
One survey showed that 1 out of 6 couples had a violent episode during the survey year.
Physical violence occurs between family members more often than it occurs between any other individuals in any other setting except for wars and riots.
These statistics apply equally to the Asian Pacific community.
This was evidenced in the tragic events of the past year.
In the case of Khoua Her, the mother who was convicted of murdering her six children, police were alerted and had gone to her home several times on calls for domestic abuse.
She attempted suicide and many domestic abuse advocates believed she was a battered spouse.
Additionally, in the example of Bo Lor, the woman who is missing and presumed murdered by her husband, police had gone to her home numerous time to resolve domestic disputes.
Her family was aware of the domestic violence going on in her marriage.
38 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans Sexual Assault The Medical Association of America in a report (November 1995) made the following observations and findings: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The U.S. Department of Justice reports the sexual assault is the costliest crime in the U.S.
The annual cost of sexual assault is $127 billion in the United States.
The legal term "rape" has traditionally referred to forced vaginal penetration of a woman by a male assailant.
Many states have now abandoned this concept in favor of the gender-neutral concept of sexual assault.
Among the acts classified as sexual assault is acquaintance, or date rape, generally defined as an assault in which the victim knows the assailant.
Assailants unknown to the victim perpetrate approximately 20% of sexual assaults against women.
Friends, acquaintances, intimate, and family members commit the remainders.
Acquaintance rape is particularly common among adolescent victims.
The majority of sexual assault victims are young.
A 1991 report stated that 32% of sexual assaults by acquaintances occur when the victim is between the ages of 11 and 17.
A 1992 report estimated that 61% of victims of sexual assault are under age 18.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sociocultural Factors Ã¯Â¿Â½ Several sociocultural influences contribute to the incidence and prevalence of sexual assault.
These include increased acceptance of interpersonal violence, adversarial stereotypes of male-female relationships, prevalent myths about rape, and sex role stereotyping.
Some victims of attacks meeting the legal definition of rape do not label their experience as sexual assault.
Common myths surrounding rape include: only women can be sexually assaulted; victims who truly resist cannot be raped; no really doesn't mean no; nice girls don't get raped; and "she asked for it."
Male rape victims may feel that others will question their sexuality if they report the incident or that they, in fact, subconsciously desired and complied with their assault.
Each of these beliefs can lead to confused attitudes, emotions, and behavior, both among victims and others.
Blame can be shifted from perpetrator to victim, leading to a process of "secondary victimization" leading to lack of support for and even condemnation of the victim.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Effects of Sexual Assault on Victims Ã¯Â¿Â½ Many victims of sexual assault develop a post-traumatic stress syndrome that has been referred to as Rape Trauma Syndrome.
Symptoms can include fear, helplessness, shock and disbelief, guilt, humiliation and embarrassment, anger, self-blame, flashbacks of the rape, avoidance of previously pleasurable activities, avoidance of the place or circumstance in which the rape occurred, depression, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, and impaired memory.
State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 39 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sexual assault affects the family and friends of the victim, as well.
Following sexual assault, victims often pull away from intimate relationships or, alternatively, become regressively fearful, clinging, and needy.
Family members can find themselves dealing not only with their own reactions to the assault on their loved one, but also with the psychological, medical, and behavioral changes they see in the victim.
In the past few years, a number of young Hmong girls in their early teens were the victims of gang-related sexual assaults.
A thirteen-year-old Hmong girl in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, who was recently charged with killing her newborn baby, was a victim of rape.
Because of the lack of culturally appropriate services for victims of sexual assaults in the Asian Pacific community, these victims and their families were left on their own to cope.
Not only were they not given support by their families, the community was shunning them as "tainted" persons
.Gang/Youth Violence We feel we are missing the Asian community.
We've hired Asian police, put money into programs but the crime rate among Asian youth and gangs is still going up.
We need to sit down with the Asian leaders and brainstorm new approaches to restorative justice.
Lieutenant Deborah Montgomery, City of Saint Paul Police Department The problem of gang/youth violent activities is an ever-present concern in the Asian Pacific community.
Being an immigrant community, there is a great generation gap between parents and children.
Parents desperately try to maintain their culture and language at the same time as trying to function in a new culture.
Their children effortlessly adopt the American culture and language as their own.
This is the cause of great misunderstandings and miscommunication between parents and children.
Many children run away from home and some of them turn to gangs for support and acceptance.
A runaway thirteen-year-old Hmong girl was brutally raped and killed in Brooklyn Park in October 1998.
In 1997, 3,470 Asian Pacific juveniles were apprehended representing 4.4% of all juvenile apprehensions made in Minnesota.
One third of all apprehensions involved auto vehicles thefts.
(Minnesota Department of Public Safety).
Community Development Many Asian Pacific Americans struggle with the issue of "biculturalism."
They are struggling to maintain values and beliefs from their traditional cultures, while adopting some of the traits of the host culture.
These are often every day tangibles such as language, dress, and food.
Examples of some of the differences are Asian cultures have a past time focus in contrast to the Anglo -Americans future time focus, and to be communal instead of individualistic.
Teachers and textbooks do little to educate students as to the diversity within the Asian Pacific community or to teach Asian students about their histories and cultures.
This has led to much ignorance in the rest of the population and has resulted in violence and intolerance against the Asian Pacific people.
As a student reflected: 40 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans "After graduation from high school, I attended a college in a Midwestern town where I found myself invited to "dinners for foreign students" sponsored by local churches and clubs like the Rotary.
I politely tried to explain to my kind hosts that I was not a "foreign student."
My fellow students and even my professors would ask me how long I had been in America and where I had learned to speak English.
"In this country," I would reply.
And sometimes I would add: "I was born in America, and my family has been here for three generations."

Minnesota has three Asian Pacific theatre companies and several ethnic dance troops.
Organizations such as the Asian American Renaissance use the arts to educate others about Asian Pacific Americans.
Minnesota has over 20 Asian Pacific mutual assistance associations/community based organizations that provide services to the Asian Pacific community.
Within this past year, a group of Asian policy makers came together to form the Asian Pacific Policy Roundtable.
They hope to work collectively to make or influence policy for the betterment of the Asian Pacific community here in Minnesota.
Another group of As ian Pacific Minnesotans are coming together, combining their resources, and working towards building an Asian Pacific community center that will be a learning center and social gathering place for Asian Pacific people of all ages as well as other interested persons.
The center will provide youth activities, art performances, and cultural exhibitions for the community.
Even with all these efforts, there is still a great need to educate others about Asian Pacific people.
It is crucial that health, social and human service practitioners, social agencies and educational institutions become more culturally competent so that they can better meet the needs of the increasing Asian Pacific population.
Educators, health, social and human service State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 41 practitioners in rural and urban Minnesota are no longer faced with clients and patients of only one culture, but with families who are of different cultural backgrounds and beliefs, and with different needs.
Educators and practitioners lack knowledge of the diverse backgrounds of their patients, thus fostering a gap in their ability to assist such a diverse group.
Educators and practitioners are finally coming to the realization they lack training and knowledge to assist and understand diverse populations.
On the other hand, physicians have misinterpreted their visible observations.
Traditional Southeast Asian healing rituals include coin rubbing or coining.
These folk remedies have an honored place in many refugee communities.
They involve rubbing the skin with a coin or the side of a spoon to alleviate common symptoms of minor illnesses.
This procedure produces bruising which has been diagnosed as child abuse by American medical staff.
Refugees question the competency of doctors who are not familiar with these folk healing remedies.
These examples demonstrates that there needs to be greater communication between the Asian Pacific community and non-Asian Pacific communities.
The opportunities are there for partnerships and collaborations.
42 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans ISSUES AND CONCERNS: LOOKING TO THE FUTURE "We will all be minorities."
Ronald Takaki The greatest challenge for Minnesota in the 21st Century will be its changing demographics.
The citizens of Minnesota are becoming more diverse.
Minnesota Planning in a report entitled State of Diversity found that not all Minnesotans citizens are sharing in the benefits of prosperity.
Gaps in income and education between whites and people of color are large and often growing.
An increasing proportion of the state's children are poor children of color, meaning that if trends continue, economic and social gaps among the state's racial and ethnic groups could grow wider.
Racism, exclusion, poor education, and poverty prevent many Minnesotans from achieving their dreams for their families.
By 2025, more than half of Minnesotans will be over age 40, and about 17 percent will be African American, Asian Pacific American, American Indian or Hispanic, according to population projections by the State Demographic Center at Minnesota Planning.
Minnesota Planning reports that in 30 years the state's population will stand at 5.3 million, compared to about 4.6 million now.

48 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans CAPM's Objectives for the Next Biennium In the past year, the Council hosted numerous community meetings and briefings throughout the state of Minnesota.
Where ever the staff went, they noticed Asian Pacific communities developing, growing, and contributing to the places where they were living.
Communities voiced the needs and concerns as outlined in Section III.
Meeting with the community has given the Council clarity and priorities on what needs to be accomplished in the next biennium.
Mental Health Building Capacity The Council will work with government and private entities to seek funding for a scholarship program to assist Asian Pacific mental health providers obtain graduate school degrees so as to enable them to become licensed service providers.
Collaborative agreements will be pursued with graduate schools of Social Work and other professional schools in the Twin Cities area to recruit and retain qualified applicants.
Recipients of assistance would be expected to work in local community clinics or agencies for a determined period of time.
This represents an expense to the State of Minnesota in the short run.
Improving access to mental health services will, however, play an important role in the prevention of further tragic events in the Hmong and other Southeast Asian communities.
Mental health services could have prevented some of the violent and disturbing events of the past several months.
There is an urgent need for better trained mental health professionals with graduate degrees in the Asian-Pacific community.
Persons with advanced degrees in social work and related mental health professions who can become licensed are needed in order to satisfy Rule 29 clinic requirements.
Without individual licensure, agencies cannot be reimbursed for their services by medical assistance or insurance companies.
In the related chemical dependency field, a person now needs to have a four-year degree before becoming eligible for licensure.
There is also a strong need for more Asian Pacific health professionals trained in the delivery of chemical dependency.
Currently, there are Asian Pacific providers lacking advanced degrees or licenses that are doing a wonderful job providing services, but can not be reimbursed for their work.
For example, there are two bachelor's level Hmong workers at CUHCC who are very competent but whose services are generally not reimbursed by the health plans.
Only one of CUHCC's eleven SEA staff members has a MSW.
At the Wilder Foundation's Southeast Asian Social Adjustment Program, only two out of 16 employees have master's degrees.
Many others have BA degrees, so the insurance companies does not reimburse their services.
The agencies must scramble to find funding for these staff.
Educating, training, and licensing more Asian Pacific mental health providers would effectively address many of the issues affecting those communities today.
We must not underestimate the State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 49 scope of issues affecting many refugees and immigrants as they attempt to adapt to life in the United States.
War-related trauma results in serious depression and Post -Traumatic Stress disorder for many refugees and immigrants.
Helping individuals learn to cope with mental health problems would reduce the risk of violence and other social problems, and would improve their chances of participating fully in American society.
Mental Health Programs and Services Given the severe shortage of professionally trained and licensed mental health providers from the Asian communities, Rule 29 clinics, hospital based clinics, and other mental health agencies must struggle financially to hire and retain bilingual workers who are not generally reimbursable by the insurance companies.
Special funding for partial support of Rule 29 clinics and hospital based clinics with Southeast Asian employees who do not yet have advanced degrees or licensure necessary for reimbursement should be made available.
This funding would allow clinics to employ currently unlicensed staff under the full supervision of licensed personnel to provide services to SEA refugee clients while more persons in the communities are earning their master's degrees.
Most current funding sources target very specific client groups which makes it difficult for Rule 29 clinics and other mental health agencies to provide general services to Southeast Asian refugees.
While projects supported by such funding are important, bilingual staff at these clinics and agencies are often unable to address common, but still serious problems.
These organizations desperately need the flexibility to provide services to existing and known individuals seeking services, but who often do not qualify for services in specially targeted programs.
More bilingual workers are needed in clinics currently serving Southeast Asian refugees and in mainstream clinics in areas lacking culturally specific resources.
Although the most concentrated populations are found in the Twin Cities, resources also need to be committed to outstate areas with Southeast Asian communities.
A need assessment should be conducted in all communities with Southeast Asian residents to determine the needs of Rule 29 and hospital based clinics that are trying to serve refugees.
Many families are facing crisis situations.
They do not know where to go for help.
There is a huge disconnect between the mainstream service providers and the Asian Pacific community who turns to them for assistance and help.
It is extremely important that in crisis, intervention be culturally appropriate and guided.
The hotline will be staffed with bilingual professionals who are culturally competent to deliver the service.
Violence Prevention Programs and Services Increase the capacity of the Asian-Pacific communities to provide services to victims of violence through a comprehensive Violence Prevention Initiative.
This translates into enhancing existing 50 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans services and creating new services.
The Init iative will mobilize the Asian Pacific communities at large to find solutions to prevent violence in the community.
This involves a community awareness campaign, training and education on the issues, and networking.
Parts of the Initiative includes: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A public awareness campaign focusing on domestic violence, sexual assault, and youth violence in the Asian Pacific community A research project to assess the extent, root causes, and cost of violence in the Asian Pacific community and to improve data collection practices of mainstream systems and institutions that work with the Asian Pacific community Creation of partnerships and collaborations between community and police, including training for police, the judicial system, and community agencies about violence in the Asian Pacific community Intervention and Prevention Programs for gang/youth violence, including parenting skills education Increase the capacity of agencies that are providing sexual assault and domestic violence prevention and intervention services to the Asian Pacific community Full funding to complete the House of Peace shelter for battered women and families In order for agencies to effectively intervene and prevent violence, they must offer services that overcome the language and cultural barriers in Asian Pacific communities.
Agencies exist in the community which are able to intervene in and prevent violence in culturally appropriate and effective ways.
However, these agencies are woefully under funded and therefore, can only meet the needs of the communities if adequate funding is supplied.
The Minnesota Department of Corrections estimates that at least 132,000 domestic assaults occur annually based on police reports submitted in the state of Minnesota.
The U.S. Department of Justice has found that the tangible and intangible costs of one domestic assault are $9,350 per assault.
Thus, the cost of domestic assault in Minnesota is $1,234,200,000.* The U.S. Department of Justice reports the sexual assault is the costliest crime in the U.S.
The annual cost of sexual assault is $127 billion in the United States.* The National Institute of Justice found that 43% of domestic violence incidents occurring over a 25 month period involved only about 7% of 1,450 households.* Victims are repeatedly victimized.
Thus, by helping one domestic assault victim to get out of a dangerous situation, many repeat victimization's are prevented.
Self-Sufficiency The State's Commitment The Council will continue to monitor and work with state agencies to implement the state's welfare to work program.
Current Department of Trade and Economic Development (DTED) and Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) funding falls short of covering the cost to State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 51 meet the demand for job placement services.
We lfare to work takes commitment from all those involved, government, private industries, and the individual.
The state must meet its commitment in ensuring that there are enough case workers to work with people who are interested in finding jobs.
Securing a job is only half the battle for MFIP participants.
Often it is difficult for them to retain their positions or advance in the company.
Training designed to help them retain their positions and give them the skills which could help them advance will help ensure they can truly move to self-sufficiency.
Current MFIP training programs are providing participants with English language skills and job skills while helping them find jobs, however, the current training skills only help participants secure jobs that pay an average of $6 per hour.
This level of pay, even if two family members are employed, does not meet livable wage standards, particularly those who are supporting large families.
To do this, the Council will work with interested parties to design and implement comprehensive programs must be designed with full partnership of employers, training facilities and immigrant/refugee service providers that will provide immigrants with the technical skills training, job-specific English language training and job readiness training needed to secure livable wage jobs.
Child care and transportation services must also be included as they are the two biggest barriers to participation in training programs.
The Community's Commitment The Council is an advocate for community based organizations.
We see the value of the work that they are doing and will continue to seek ways to support and strengthen them.
Current community based immigrant/refugee service providers have a proven track record for working efficiently in collaborations and in providing employment services.
These providers have existing relationships with employers and program participants.
They also fully understand the complicated needs of the immigrant/refugee populations with whom they work.
Contract with immigrant/refugee service providers on a fee-per-individual served basis to provide case management services to program participants.
Fee-per-individual program reimbursement ensures that use of funding will be maximized.
By selecting one agency to provide administrative services, the collaborative will have a better ability to streamline communication with each other and the state.
The Employer's Commitment The Council will work with legislators and Ramsey County to replicate the training program model developed by the Center for Asian Pacific Islanders (CAPI) and to expand it into the East Metro area.
CAPI has partnered with several Western Hennepin County employers and the Scott County Education Cooperative to develop this "work first" program.
Participants receive training, which provides them with the enhanced skills necessary for securing unsubsidized employment, thus leading them to economic self-sufficiency.
Employers find the program successful as it has lowered their employee recruitment and retention costs.
52 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans CAPI's model has proven to be effective.
By replicating this model in the East Metro area, a broader segment of Southeast Asian MFIP participants could gain enhanced training skills directly from employers to increase their potential for securing livable wage employment.
Developing a jobs training center at an East Metro industrial site which would be easily accessible by public transportation and would be large enough to accommodate several employer training stations and several hundred trainees.
Education Language and Literacy Work towards enhancing, strengthening, or developing language and literacy programs that will focus and measured based upon student achievement.
Among Asian Pacific people, 73.3 percent speak a language other than English, compared with 13.8 percent of the total U.S. population.
Schools lack the commitment, teachers, materials, or understanding of second language acquisition to make the promise of educational access real for non-English-speaking students.
Although most students are conversant in English, it often takes three to five years for students to comprehend the language and use it as a medium of academic learning.
Most Asian Pacific students are receiving only a limited amount of bilingual education.
Students are pulled out of regular class for an hour or two at a time for bilingual education, taking them away from their class and the learning that is occurring there.
Bilingual education needs to be fully implemented in a concentrated effort.
Parents of students who are in bilingual education classes have a limited understanding of the premise for bilingual education and often are dissatisfied with the results.
They do not want their children in these classes and would rather their children be in regular classes so that they can be immersed in the English language.
Among teachers and educators concerned with second language acquisition, they believe that developing strong literacy in one's native language first is an effective and appropriate strategy to promote both English fluency and academic achievement.
Community Partnerships for Parental Involvement Work with various school districts, community based organizations, community members, and parents to devise programs that wo uld incorporate Asian Pacific parents into the school system.
Parents trust and work with community based organizations.
Often times they go to the organizations for translation of materials they receive from the schools as well as interpretation, understanding, and validation of what they have been told by school officials.
Partnership between the schools and community based organizations would save parents time and stress if they could work together on a communication/education plan for parents to be involved in their children's education.
Additionally, parents may relate to the school system as they did in their former countries with respect and deference and so do not actively participate in decision making in the schools.
Some parents do not have educational backgrounds and may not know how to interact with school State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 53 officials or help their children in the school process.
Parents and youth also need to be educated about the nature and choices within the educational system (public and private colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, and professional degrees) as well as the intricacies of financial aid.
By working together community based organizations and schools can help to bridge this gap.
Asian Pacific Teachers and Staff The Council will continue to work with public and private institutions to create opportunities for the training and licensure of teachers of Asian Pacific descent.
Although minority students make up 13.5% of the total student population for Minnesota, only 2.5% of public school teachers are from the minority community.
In the St. Paul Public District, 57.3 percent of the students are from minority communities yet only 13.2 percent of teachers are from minority communities.
Without well-trained, culturally competent, bilingual Asian Pacific American teachers, administrators, counselors, and other professionals strong language programs cannot be delivered, students in need of mental health or health services to support their academic achievement are neither identified nor served, thus, rendering Asian Pacific students a high risk for educational difficulties.
Teachers of all cultural backgrounds must become knowledgeable about the strengths of the diverse Asian Pacific cultures and how a child's home culture contributes to learning and development.
For example, in recent years, teachers in California noticed that some Hmong and Mien kindergartners and first -graders were lagging behind other children in the development of memory skills, motor skills, eye hand coordination, and concentration skills.
The teachers were surprised, only ten years ago, they had appeared very advanced in these areas.
Then teachers discovered that the families were no longer teaching their children these skills through traditional means: participation in oral rituals, embroidery, and silver work.
The family patterns had been broken up by the many years in the refugee camps and in the process of dislocation and relocation in the United States.
Few immigrant families teach these skills the way many other American families do: with crayons and coloring books, scissors and cutouts, and by reading to their children nightly.(AAPIP Report p. 22).
Multicultural Curricula The Council will take an active role in the development and implementation of multicultural curricula for schools to use to support student achievement.
Schools must have access to and be provided curricula appropriate to educating multicultural, multilingual student populations.
As more and more students of color and immigrants throughout the world enroll in schools teachers need to reshape their teaching approaches and curricula to meet the needs of the students in their rooms.
Textbooks are outdated and lag behind the needs of a diverse community.
Teachers are faced with the responsibility to find and create curricula which is most often time dependent on students' personal experiences through oral presentations and writing exercises.
The students become the expert, but in most cases, few students know about the historical and contemporary realities of Asian Pacific communities.
In schools where multicultural curriculum exists, it is sometimes reduced to "honoring" Asian Pacific people through International Day or Asian 54 State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans Pacific Heritage Day where students are encouraged to wear their native clothing and share their native food.
Such approaches perpetuate stereotypes and are irrelevant to some Asian Pacific students, especially, if they are third or fourth generation and or are not knowledgeable about their culture and history.
The Asian Pacific community needs to be consulted and its expertise needs to be utilized in the planning and creation of curriculum that will reflect the full Asian Pacific experience in the United States of America, including generation and gender differences, roles, and expectations.
Community Development Asian Pacific Leaders in the Public Arena Initiative The Council will partner with other organizations to facilitate and provide a framework for the development of leaders in the public arena as well as training programs, forums, and dialogue, i.e., the League of Women Voters and the Wilder Foundation's Southeast Asian Leadership Training Program.
The Asian Pacific population in Minnesota is growing and by 2000 it is projected to be the second largest minority group in Minnesota and yet it is the least educated population in the area of the public life and service.
Education related needs include language and citizenship courses to facilitate political action within the community, leadership training and networking programs to provide support and opportunities for public service.
It is vital to the State of Minnesota's political, social and economic health to train and develop effective public leaders in the Asian Pacific community so that all voices and needs can be heard and properly addressed.
Asian Pacific Heritage Month Commemoration Obtain funding to support activities in commemoration of Asian Pacific Heritage Month: the Festival, Annual Dinner 
A mandate of the Council is to ensure that Asia Pacific Minnesotans' talents and resources are used and promoted.
In the past, the Council has used Heritage Month to effectuate this mandate that would br idge the Asian Pacific community and the non-Asian Pacific community.
Currently in the Council's base budget there is no allocation for the commemoration and promotion of Asian Pacific Heritage Month which occurs in May of each year.
The Council would like to promote Heritage Month statewide, but due to lack of financial resources, we have been limited in our efforts.
As twenty-five percent of Asian Pacific people make greater Minnesota their home, there needs to be a more coordinated effort for the st atewide promotion of Heritage Month.
State of Minnesota Biennial Report 1997-1998 Council on Asian-Pacific Minnesotans 55 Community Center Work with governmental entities, private industries, foundations, and individuals to obtain funding for the creation and establishment of an Asian Pacific community center.
The Asian Pacific community in Minnesota is coming together to collaborate and work on creating an Asian American community center.
The Center, with an arts and culture focus, will be a learning center and a place of social gathering.
The initial space needs are a 1,000 seat auditorium, a library, youth activities space, a move theater, performing/rehearsal areas, dance studios and office space.
The community is in its first stages of planning and has secured partial funding from the St. Paul Companies to conduct a feasibility study.
For this project, the Council will continue to work and take an active leadership role in the development and formation stages of the Center.
The Council will work with the community to gather input and consensus for a plan of action.
This will entail working with community based organizations on their vision and space needs, architects and designers, as well as with members of the legislature to secure public funding for the projected.
