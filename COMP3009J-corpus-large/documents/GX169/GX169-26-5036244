Arizona, California Data Capture Centers to Process Census 2000 Spanish-Language Questionnaires
Now that the Phoenix Data Capture Center is open, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau is on track to process more than 150 million questionnaires for Census 2000.
Two of the four data capture centers will process Spanish-language questionnaires.
In addition to Phoenix, the Census Bureau has data capture centers in Baltimore; Jeffersonville, Ind.; and Pomona, Calif.
All four centers have state-of-the-art computer equipment.
The Phoenix and Pomona centers will process Spanish-language questionnaires.
To distribute the workload evenly, the Phoenix center has been designated to process about 1.7 million Spanish-language questionnaires, while Pomona will receive about 1.8 million questionnaires from Puerto Rico, of which roughly 1.6 million will be Spanish-language forms and 200,000 will be in English.
For the first time, optical scanners will be used to process the Spanish-language questionnaires.
The scanners recognize handwritten responses, not just filled-in ovals or boxes.
Scanned images are processed and translated into computer code and the responses are then transmitted electronically over secure lines to Census Bureau headquarters for statistical processing and analysis.
"We expect these technological improvements to speed up processing and reduce errors, as well as help capture the questionnaire answers from our nation's Spanish-speaking population a continuing concern in our drive to make this a fair and accurate census," said Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt.
