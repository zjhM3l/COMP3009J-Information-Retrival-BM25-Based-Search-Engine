II.
Center Operation ~ * Sunny shared with Team the "12 Steps to Keeping Your Job" hand out as a resource for Center Customers.
She requested that the Team review the handout.
The Team made recommendations for changes.
Action: Sunny make changes and e-mail Team final draft copy.
* Resource Specialist Coverage - ESD and WDC will share the coverage of the Wednesday afternoon gaps for the time being.
RS coverage by ESD (Noon-1:00) and WDC (1:00-2:30).
* Job Hunter Series - Tammy reported that Job Hunter Series facilitator copies are still on order.
The decision about mandatory attendance of CPP is not yet decided.
Implementation date is set for April 1^st.
* The Team had a conversation about overcoming challenges to accommodating large numbers of workshop attendees in the hands-on components of the curriculum.
In developing a workshop curriculum for the Center, we have a quality standard which requires a hands-on/interactive component.
L Questions:
* Does the Job Hunter Series provide customers with opportunities for hands on participation and what will it look like? * Can the series be broken down into parts? * If there's a lab component in the series, how will we make the accommodations when there are 18 computers available? * How much knowledge would a Center Intern need to proctor lab? Do they need to know content information or just software navigation?
L Suggestions:
* Discussion about having two mechanisms to deliver the job hunter series - demonstration by PowerPoint and hands-on lab usage.
* The facilitator could have 1 group in the lab while the 2^nd group takes a break (groups will alternate in the lab).
* Show customers how to navigate through the series by PowerPoint and provide options to use the lab for further exploration (Center intern can proctor).
Further discussion when the Team gets copy of the series for review.
Action Pending: Tammy provide members the facilitators handbook for Job Hunter.
* Volunteer Issues - Gary reported that he would check with Dan Vogel for legalities around having a community volunteer at the Center.
Action: Gary checks with Dan.
Action: Erika provide Gary with draft job description for a Resource Lobby support volunteer by Wednesday, 2/6.
Gary reported on the behalf of Susan Parker and Angela about getting an Intern for the Center.
The follow up action was a dead end and there was no outcome.
Angela may possibly have another contact from Western for a work-study student.
This would provide some potential advantages over a volunteer.
Action: Angela will follow up with new lead.
* Lab software / New PC's - The Team was asked to make a list of recommendations for software that we wan on the lab's new PC's.
Team's recommendation to keep:
* MS office Suite (Word, Excel, Access 
* Allied Health PowerPoint Presentation - Gary introduced Christina Benjamin an Intern from BTC. Christina is working on a PowerPoint presentation for Allied Health.
The recruitment presentation will provide information about various healthcare fields, salary, education, physical demand, etc...
The completion date for the project is end of February.
* All Staff Training - Tammy and Erika will provide training on the "Go2UI.com" website on February 27 from 4-5.
The CUT forum moved to March 27 from 4:00-5:00.
III.
Quality Management ~
* Application Scoring - Gary followed up with the Certification Team at our Team's request for clarifications regarding the application scoring system.
They responded and provided an explanation of the numeric rating - Whatcom's app scored in the highest quartile, thereby making it eligible for a site review.
They reiterated the CUT focus on the scoring sheet's written comments and those recommendations from the technical writing report to help better understand the areas of improvement rather than to concentrate on the application's numeric scoring.
* Begin Introduction to Resource Specialist Training Module - A subgroup of the Training Team was developed to look at a strategy for identifying module pieces for RS training.
Team consisted of Kathy K, Ronnie Sue and Gary S. Once the training strategies are identified, the three Centers (Oak Harbor, Skagit 
Whatcom is already providing training opportunities for Resource Specialists - All Staff mtg.
IT training, problem solving, etc.
* Baldrige Learning - As part of human resource development in assisting staff to better understand the Baldrige quality standards, staff in Skagit County are providing a "readiness to engage" learning opportunity.
The first training will be on February 14 on all 7 quality standards as a whole system, followed by a weekly training on one quality standard.
Action: All CUT members to share information about the excellent Baldrige-based quality training opportunity for current and new staff members within their offices/organizations.
* To reinforce the quality standards, WDC has reorganized their agenda items around Baldridge criteria.
Each item is categorized under one of the 7 quality standards.
Facilitators and staff have an opportunity to arrange the agenda according to they see fit.
The activity helps staff see that connection between their daily work and how it's the quality standards.
A sample staff meeting agenda was distributed demonstrating how agenda topics are organized within the seven Baldrige criteria.
* Mystery Shopper - WA State is looking at customer satisfaction levels through a mystery shopper evaluation.
ESD is leading the effort.
The evaluation will review services from the customers' perspective (Job seekers/Business customers).
They will be using different measurements i.e. how many rings before pick up, how long it takes to return calls, etc.
The mystery shopper evaluation is a quality management tool used in researching information and collecting data, not for singling out staff doing a less than quality job.
* WDC 2002 Action Plan - Workforce Development Board is responsible for governance and oversight of the workforce development system.
Each year the Board, with the assistance of a variety of private, education, labor, and government sectors, develops an action plan and sets goals.
The ACTION PLAN for 2002 is Business Services.
The CUT is responsible for caring out business services.
Handout: "Business Activity Heats Up at WorkSource Whatcom", demonstrating some of the recent efforts here to build our services to business.
