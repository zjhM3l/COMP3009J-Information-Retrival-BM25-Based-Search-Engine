Secondary Prevention and Treatment
Secondary prevention was defined as an attempt to reduce the consequences of disease among persons with symptoms of disease.
Surveillance and Monitoring
Surveillance is useful for research but also for the allocation of resources and policy development.
In this session, the participants suggested that screening practices be monitored.
The group members stressed the importance of identifying current screening practices and determining where the system is broken.
They noted that despite the lack of certainty about the value of prostate cancer screening, physicians are screening.
To learn more about the results of the screening, epidemiologists need to know how much and what type of screening is taking place among men in the population.
Some participants noted that the current studies on screening have not been inconclusive; they simply have not been sufficiently conclusive to be convincing.
In one study, for example, the number of PSA tests performed on asymptomatic men could be determined, but because the study lacked clarity and surveillance, it lost the precision necessary to make a stronger statement about screening efficacy.
The participants also questioned how and whether the DRE should be used in routine preventive screening.
Some participants stated that it is not clear whether DRE is a valuable screening method, either alone or as an adjunct to the PSA test.
Some participants stated that the DRE is used by some clinicians to make PSA screening more selective, to reduce overdiagnosis.
Some participants noted that DRE may increase the number of diagnoses by adding positive DRE tests to positive PSA tests.
Some participants indicated that they never do DREs routinely.
In Indian Health Services facilities, however, DRE may be the only screening method available.
The participants addressed the importance of monitoring current screening methods because when the methods change, the old results no longer apply.
They discussed the change of biopsy techniques.
PSA results do not provide information on the location of the tumor.
Some cancers are serendipitously detected by biopsy.
The amount and location of tissue removed during a biopsy affects the likelihood of finding a tumor.
The participants thought that it would be useful to determine how often serendipitous tumor finding occurs with current biopsy techniques.
The group also thought it would be helpful to learn what clinicians are doing the screening and what clinicians are treating men with prostate cancer.
The participants discussed the importance of building public health infrastructure and fostering collaborations.
Public health organizations were urged to foster better collaborations between government and research groups and to ensure that good research ideas are funded.
Participants noted several points.
Committees, departments, or governments should not dictate research questions.
Government offices are better at addressing global questions and policy than developing research questions.
Government agencies can contribute to research by providing funding to support networking of researchers, such as establishing research consortia.
An example of a successful consortium is Heal-Net, a multicenter, multiresource network in Canada.
Group participants discussed several suggestions for the role of public health.
The public health community could also foster networking, by organizing and by funding data workshops in which researchers can share information.
At the present time, it can be difficult to obtain data for secondary analyses.
A recent attempt at conducting a metaanalysis of five studies was only successful in obtaining data from three of the studies.
Investigators often fear losing credit in sharing data and do not want to invest time and expenses.
Data-sharing workshops would help researchers locate resources, as well as provide opportunities for combining data, resources, and methodological capabilities.
The members discussed the importance of expanding and improving cancer registries.
Registries with underserved populations are needed, and the registries must improve the accuracy of reporting race/ethnicity.
Currently, North and South Dakota are not included in the registries.
Thus, data from the present registries do not allow epidemiologists to generalize from one group to another, especially between Native American groups.
In addition, prostate cancer data from the SEER study cannot be applied to populations in the northern plains or the northwest.
The participants also suggested that registries must be validated and that their inaccuracies and biases, such as those occurring in the coding of deaths, must be corrected.
They noted that underreporting of the number of deaths due to prostate cancer may be occurring in many regions in the United States.
The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) demonstrated the difficulty of reviewing a registry record to determine which treatments were provided for prostate cancer patients.
The participants suggested that fields could be added to the registries to indicate the method of diagnosis of cancer, for example, by adding a field that indicates whether the patient's cancer was diagnosed by PSA screening or independent of screening.
Presently, the stage of cancer is required in the registry, but PSA status is not.
No distinction is made between diagnostic and postoperative staging.
Data from both staging methods are needed.
The group suggested that the current practices for obtaining informed consent for screening should be monitored.
The public health community should determine what physicians are telling their patients about the comorbidity and mortality issues related to current screening and treatment recommendations.
Some participant stated that much of the information available to patients does not meet the criteria for informed decision making.
It was noted that many health care providers believe that obtaining a blood sample for a PSA test is easier than taking 5 to 10 minutes to discuss the pros and cons of the test first.
Thus, the group recommended that an appropriate process to obtain informed consent for prostate cancer screening should be developed.
Participants discussed a 4-year study conducted by the U.S. Army War College, which included commissioned military officer personnel, used an informed consent document that presented the pros and cons of screening.
Of those in the study, approximately 98 percent of the men in their 40s elected to have screening despite the potential negative effect that having prostate cancer diagnosis could have on their military careers.
However, it was not clear to some participants whether the informed consent process accurately presented the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment or the magnitude of the potential harm.
The group ended this part of the session with a discussion of the importance of conducting retrospective surveillance studies to provide better information about the natural history of prostate cancer.
It is not clear what it means for a 50-year-old man to have a PSA level of 3 that rises to 4 ten years later.
One of the difficulties with conducting surveillance studies is that the disease develops very slowly and long-term follow-up is needed.
The public health community might use existing resources to retrospectively evaluate current treatment practices and study outcome patterns.
Serum repositories have been used in the past to combine PSA data from analysis of stored samples with clinical data collected in longitudinal studies.
Serum and data collected for unrelated diseases, could be used for prostate cancer research.
One example is a cardiology study with available serum samples of approximately 13,000 men.
The husbands of the nurses who participated in a nurses' health study are another potential resource.
However, regulatory policies in the United States may require that investigators obtain new informed consent from the participants.
Research
The participants began this part of their discussion by focusing on the importance of conducting research that targets specific subgroups.
Priority in research should be given to men who might benefit most from screening such as men of certain ages or ethnicities or with certain risk factors.
Clinical trials are needed to answer questions about specific subgroups, such as African Americans or Native Americans.
The group noted that controversy exists about population-based screening, but screening among high risk populations is being conducted.
Currently, the evidence is not clear as to whether it is appropriate to conduct testing, or case finding, for particular high risk groups.
If screening turns out to be harmful rather than beneficial, men in the high risk group will be inadvertently harmed.
African American men are clearly at higher risk for prostate cancer because they are more likely to have disease 5 to 7 years earlier than white men are.
The group also discussed difficulties in recruiting underserved populations into studies.
Although research on underserved populations is needed, it is difficult to persuade these individuals to participate in clinical trials.
The PLCO investigators created a screening center that focused on recruiting men from underserved groups.
They had hoped to randomize a high percentage of the participants from underserved populations.
Despite the investment of millions of additional dollars, these enrollment goals were not met.
Screening centers in Detroit, Michigan, and Cleveland, Ohio, were successful, and special projects were created to try to understand how underserved men reacted to study recruitment messages.
In Denver, Colorado, an effort was made to enroll Hispanics and other target groups, including African Americans, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders.
The costs of enrolling underserved groups were high.
Education level, not the skin color, appeared to some meeting participants to be the factor that most influenced participation.
However, some program participants noted that African Americans might refuse to participate because they might believe that the study was designed to help white men.
Many resources are required to learn why men from different ethnic groups do not participate in screening studies.
The group stated that treatment trials are different.
Once prostate cancer has been detected, the issue becomes whether equitable resources are available for everyone to obtain all the available treatment options.
The overall enrollment in the PIVOT trial was said to have been about 25 percent African American and 5 percent Hispanic.
It was unclear how representative that trial is of other treatment trials.
The group noted that both low-literacy populations and populations with limited economic resources should be targeted.
Eighty percent of the subjects in many clinical trials have a college education.
The PLCO trial has made an effort to include the underserved, but with limited success.
More information is needed about what is required to enroll people from low socioeconomic levels into clinical trials.
The participants briefly discussed the value of the Department of Defense Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) prostate cancer study.
The CPDR is a large multimillion-dollar effort that involves approximately 50 study personnel and nine military hospitals.
The military is a captive population that provides the opportunity to collect more comprehensive data than is possible with other populations.
The disadvantage of the study appears to be that, because this is a military population, the data may not be applicable to other groups.
Moreover, the trial is not randomized, so the observed relationship between screening and outcome can be biased.
Nevertheless, the group concluded that data from multiple, longitudinal, observational cohort studies are vital.
Another topic of discussion focused on the social and behavioral issues of research.
Participants stated social science can be used to determine attitudes toward shared decision making and to understand the differences in knowledge levels, attitudes, and beliefs among population subgroups.
Another social and behavioral issue that was said to deserve attention was the role of family members and loved ones after diagnosis.
A behavioral issue that was mentioned repeatedly during the session was the need to better understand attitudes and decisions regarding participation in clinical trials.
The difficulty is determining how to encourage patients to enroll and how to convince physicians to participate.
The public health community could conduct research to identify the barriers to participation and ways to break down these barriers by making participation a desirable option.
A message is needed that supports entry into trials as a treatment choice.
Participation in trials should be the preferred treatment choice and a good standard of practice.
Participants noted that enrolling subjects from underrepresented groups, such as African Americans, Native Americans, migrant populations, low-literacy populations, non-English-speaking peoples, and those from different geographic regions of the country is particularly difficult.
Trials that have deliberately attempted to enroll African Americans have had minimal success, and some centers are working to evaluate racial representation.
CDC provides funding for trials in Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to examine the reasons why African Americans participate in trials.
Men also need to be encouraged to continue to participate in trials after they have agreed to enter a study.
For example, a study in Detroit, Michigan, experienced a huge enrollment of African American patients, but many patients were lost to follow-up after the initial PSA screening.
No inquiry was made into why so many of the study participants discontinued, and the study ended prematurely.
It was noted that a research group developed a questionnaire that asked men why they chose to participate or not participate in clinical trials and created a video presentation summarizing the results.
The video was used in the informed consent process to help men decide whether to be enrolled in a study; the research group achieved a 50 percent rate of participation.
The third area of discussion focused on research to obtain baseline information.
Baseline information is needed to learn the level of public knowledge about the prostate gland and prostate cancer.
Although the public may not want to know this information, the public health community has been pressed to conduct awareness campaigns.
A question that merits research is whether more awareness is desirable if it is uncertain how to address prostate cancer prevention.
Another area that should be researched is the public's perception of the message of uncertainty about prostate cancer prevention and prostate cancer screening.
Participants discussed the importance of developing risk assessment technologies for men with prostate cancer and conducting prospective clinical studies to determine the risk associated with different treatment choices.
Participants noted that studies are needed that focus on factors and comorbidities that affect treatment outcomes, such as survival and quality of life, especially in the underserved populations.
They suggested that existing resources could be used to conduct population-based studies of treatment patterns and outcomes because a considerable amount of treatment is occurring right now.
They commented that the cancer registries are unable now to collect all of the treatment information.
The participants suggested that research end points should be evaluated and appropriate inclusion criteria identified for clinical trials.
The definitions of endpoints, such as incontinence, presently vary from study to study and should be standardized.
The public health community can help define valid, reproducible outcome measurements that would help make the results of different studies comparable.
The group recommended research on the outcome of untreated disease.
Studies have indicated that among the men with palpable tumors who are managed by watchful waiting, 80 percent are still living 15 years later.
It would be valuable to determine the comparable survival of men who are detected by PSA testing, have clinically inapparent tumors, and are managed similarly.
The participants suggested that the public health community might play a role in determining the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies, as more data are gained on the effectiveness of screening.
They discussed several other suggestions related to screening and treatment.
Economic factors should also be included in the decision making process related to prostate cancer because of the futility of screening men who do not have the financial means for treatment, such as those without health insurance.
Evaluating the extent of and reasons for variations in treatment outcomes and complications by area and provider would also provide valuable information.
One difficulty in conducting treatment research is the considerable variation in treatment complications at different centers, from different providers, and in different geographic areas.
Thus, research outcome measurements should be standardized.
Access to health care also needs to be considered in screening and treatment decisions because in some areas, limited resources for various treatments are available.
The group provided the following additional suggestions for research-related topics: * Identify adjunct screening tests that would make screening more selective by helping to determine the aggressiveness of the tumor before invasive diagnostic tests or treatments are used.
* Develop tools that help patients make informed decisions about all treatment options.
* Create a video (similar to the one designed to aid in the informed consent process for a randomized clinical study) to help men evaluate treatment options.
Services and Programs
In this session, the participants suggested that the public health community identify ways to help health care providers understand and convey to their patients the uncertainties related to prostate cancer screening and treatment.
The first topic discussed was how the public health community could help practitioners become comfortable about telling patients that the medical community is uncertain about the best ways to screen for and treat prostate cancer.
Some participants noted that some choices offered to men may be based on the provider's specialty, not on the scientific evidence, which is uncertain.
For example, urologists usually recommend surgery, and radiation oncologists recommend radiation therapy.
Participants commented that providers in the United States also tend to promote the more aggressive therapies; whereas, providers in other countries do not.
Patients need information that helps them understand their options and the implications of different choices.
The participants also suggested that the public health community foster a better understanding of the issue of overdiagnosis due to screening.
For example, preliminary results from a European randomized clinical trial of prostate cancer screening among 17,000 men aged 55 to 75 years demonstrated a high rate of overdiagnosis in the screened group.
The rate of diagnosis per thousand men was 34 in the screened group but only 4 in the control group.
Because the mortality rate from prostate cancer was 1.25, the ratio of diagnosis to death was 20 in the screened group and 3 in the unscreened group.
These results indicate a much higher level of overdiagnosis in the screened group.
The rate of diagnosis in the screened group is expected to decrease in the future with repeated screens, but the diagnosis rate may not approach the rate of disease mortality, which is the best measure available for a true diagnosis at the present time.
Participants stressed the importance of evaluating how men's health awareness affects the use of health care services.
They suggested that the public health community conduct research to determine how increased awareness about men's health issues affects the use of health care services.
They noted that the public does not believe that the health care system in the U.S. is adequate.
Thus the potential role of the patient in actively participating in prostate cancer decision making is uncertain.
Participants discussed how high risk men might be recruited to screening if it becomes clear that screening is effective.
Some of the participants suggested that public health organizations should then provide screening services.
Health Communications
Participants discussed the importance of devising methods to convey the present uncertainty about the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening and treatment.
The most important issue is to develop and convey a public health message about prostate cancer.
The message will depend on the answers to questions that are yet to be solved and require additional research.
The message must be sufficiently flexible to allow for changes as new information becomes available.
One challenge in communications is how to convey uncertainty about prostate cancer screening and treatment without undermining public trust in public health institutions and patient trust in providers.
CDC follows the prostate cancer screening policy outlined by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
The USPSTF does not recommend screening because there is insufficient evidence that screening is effective in reducing mortality and the balance of harms and benefits is uncertain.
However, not all practitioners agree with this policy.
In this context, informed decision making should be publicly supported.
Participants noted that many men are already aware of prostate cancer and many believe that screening is the right thing to do.
Men need to be educated to make informed decisions.
Some participants stated that men may not understand that screening creates an entire course that can result in overdiagnosis, treatment, side effects, and the other problems.
Men should receive information about screening that makes them aware of the possible treatment and health consequences of their decisions about screening.
Many group participants agreed that because free PSA screening and proscreening pamphlets are commonly available nationwide, men should receive education about potential harms as well as benefits before they receive any type of screening.
Some participants stated that the public health message should be against community screening outside of a full-care context.
If screening is harmful, all patients should have access to adequate follow-up and treatment.
In areas where PSA testing is available but no access to follow-up care is available, the message should be that screening should always be offered in the context of complete care.
One survey found that at least one third of men who underwent PSA testing did not even know they had received the screening test.
Participants added that information about the risks for different subgroups of the population should be communicated to those groups.
Data about some groups is inconclusive, and public health professionals should provide additional information about the risks in those populations.
A discussion about screening high risk men revealed a controversy.
One participant argued that for high risk men, such as those with a family history of prostate cancer, physicians are now engaged in case finding rather than screening.
Another questioned whether all members of high risk groups should be screened, arguing that case finding is really just "sloppy screening."
Case finding as an aggressive search among asymptomatic men for those who test positive might be harmful because no determination has yet been made as to whether screening and treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer is effective.
Thus, it is not clear what message should be conveyed, although messages about screening may vary for different populations.
Several participants concluded that "Talk to your doctor" is probably not the appropriate message.
Doctors may not know how uncertain information is about the effectiveness of screening and treatment for prostate cancer.
They stated that because conclusive evidence is not available, the message to the public should be that investigators are trying to determine if screening is effective, and that more people are needed to enroll in clinical trials to help answer questions about prostate cancer.
In discussing the importance of making informed decisions, participants considered several different points.
The group noted that many people spend months trying to make a treatment decision by conducting their own research on the World Wide Web, by reading books, and by talking to people.
To help people make informed decisions, a broad-based message is needed.
Screening is regarded as a course ending in diagnosis and treatment decisions, but men tend to face one decision at a time.
They may not consider the risks of treatment when they are trying to decide whether to have the screening test.
For example, some participants suggested that, a certain percentage of military men in the U.S. Army study decided to be tested when offered the choice may not have understood the uncertainty and risks involved in treatment.
Thus, those participants recommended that the public health community must convey the uncertainty about potential benefits and harms of prostate screening and treatment together.
Some participants suggested that a consensus statement on prostate cancer screening be developed among professional and voluntary organizations.
This document would be similar to the 1989 consensus statement on mammography that 11 organizations signed.
A major discussion involved whether the evidence for the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening was analogous to the evidence for cervical cancer screening.
Cervical cancer screening was approved for routine practice based not on the basis of evidence from clinical trails but on convincing population-based data.
Some participants thought that the combined results of the Austrian study, SEER data analyses, military studies, and a Mayo Clinic study showing reductions in mortality with screening were strong enough to support a similar conclusion for prostate cancer screening.
Others found the arguments unconvincing for several reasons.
Some population data do not show a relationship between mortality reductions and screening.
Other factors besides screening may be responsible for the changes in prostate cancer mortality in those populations.
Changes in mortality for cervical cancer were greater than for prostate cancer.
Cervical cancer screening involves detection and treatment of precancerous lesionsa situation not comparable to prostate cancer screening.
Many group members recommended that the public health community, and perhaps CDC in particular, should have a greater presence in communications about prostate cancer.
They thought that the public health community should review, explain and interpret the studies that have been conducted.
For members of the public and even physicians, assessing each individual study and or trying to evaluate all studies in combination is difficult or impossible.
Canada provides a well-researched guideline on breast cancer screening to all doctors in Canada and has developed a lay version of the scientific basis of the guideline that a woman can bring to her doctor's office.
It shortens the interview time and improves the understanding of issues.
This example could be adapted to prostate cancer.
The group stressed the importance of conveying to the public a health message about prostate cancer screening and treatment.
They drafted a four-part proposal: * Ensure consistent press coverage every day.
* Have a comprehensive balanced message * Use all communication channels, including radio, talk shows, World Wide Web, 24-hour health channels, and television.
* Use a spokesperson who conveys trustworthiness.
Participants emphasized that the unintended negative consequences of communications related to prostate cancer should be anticipated and avoided whenever possible.
For example, some people, on hearing about the importance of genetics, might conclude they do not have to think about prostate cancer if they have no family history of the disease.
Others may think prostate cancer is like breast cancer and that screening for either is effective.
Stories about a single patient's experience and thoughts on prostate cancer should not be allowed to negate the message that the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening is uncertain.
The participants also discussed the importance of creating strategies to inform the media about the controversies, uncertainties, and need for individualized informed decisions about prostate cancer screening and treatment.
They noted that much misinformation is presented by the broadcast and print media and on the World Wide Web.
The public health community should reach out to journalists and Web providers to craft correct information and to help correct misinformation.
Some members of the group suggested that spokesmen be selected to present the "other side" of the prostate cancer screening and treatment issue.
These men would present their reasons for choosing to not have screening tests or treatments for prostate cancer.
The messenger is important.
The personal views of people considered trustworthy are powerful.
The Mayor of Denver, Colorado, is a prostate cancer survivor who was successfully treated and his message is "Get screened."
Unfortunately, the positive experiences usually covered by the press are rarely balanced with negative stories.
In the Netherlands, the Queen's husband had a radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy.
He experienced severe side effects that required additional surgical procedures, including a colonostomy.
Crafting a message using this experience could send a powerful message about the risks of prostate cancer treatment.
Members of the group noted that the most effective person or group to deliver the message may be different for different groups of people.
The type of authority figure accepted by different people varies; some listen to physicians, but others do not.
In the United States, the physician's ability to get people's attention is not as strong as that of certain celebrities.
Some group members suggested that messages be targeted to spouses.
In a family, the best individuals to target may be women because they are often the decision-makers regarding family health issues.
If so, women's perceptions of prostate cancer information must be understood.
Messages about uncertainty should be crafted for women.
The group had the following discussion on educating men about prostate health.
Educating men about how the prostate organ functions rather than about diseases of the prostate might capture the interest of the public.
Prostate cancer could then be addressed as a subset of information regarding the prostate gland.
With this model, the public health community might integrate prostate cancer education into a general health care screening and management program with primary care providers and their patients.
To help men make informed decisions, the participants suggested that the public health community create patient decision making tools.
These tools might include a rationale for the watchful waiting approach to treatment.
In some circumstances, such as in rural areas of the United States or at Indian Health Services facilities, the factors to be considered in helping a patient make a choice may be limited to issues of access to health care and economic factors, such as health insurance coverage.
The participants ended this session by discussing the importance of engaging policy makers and insurers to develop consistent policies on prostate cancer screening and treatment.
Currently, policies are not consistent from state to state.
Health care purchasers and insurers must also be engaged in these discussions rather than just receiving a set of recommendations.
