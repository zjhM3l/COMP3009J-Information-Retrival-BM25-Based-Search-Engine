TITLE 40.SOCIAL SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE Part 1.
TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES
Chapter 44.
COMMUNITY CARE FOR AGED AND DISABLED PROJECT CHOICE
The Texas Department of Human Services (DHS) adopts the repeal of all the rules in Chapter 44, Â§Â§44.1, 44.101 - 44.104, and 44.201 - 44.207, without changes to the proposal published in the February 7, 2003, issue of the Texas Register (28 TexReg 1156).
Justification for the repeals is to eliminate an obsolete rule chapter from the DHS rule base.
Beginning in 1999, DHS operated two small client services programs in pilot sites as part of Project CHOICE (Consumers Have Options for Independence in Community Environments), which was funded by a grant to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC).
Project CHOICE ended when grant funding ceased in 2000.
DHS, therefore, no longer needs the rules governing this discontinued program in its rule base.
DHS received no comments regarding adoption of the repeals.
Subchapter A. DEFINITIONS
40 TAC Â§44.1
The repeal is adopted under the Human Resources Code, Chapters 22 and 32, which authorizes DHS to administer public and medical assistance programs, and under Government Code, Â§531.021, which provides HHSC with the authority to administer federal medical assistance funds.
The repeal implements the Human Resources Code, Â§Â§22.0001 - 22.038 and Â§Â§32.001 - 32.053.
This agency hereby certifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.
