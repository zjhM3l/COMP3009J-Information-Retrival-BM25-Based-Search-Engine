Case No. 5-CA-230
DECISION AND ORDER
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE IN THE ABOVE-ENTITLED PROCEEDING ISSUED HIS RECOMMENDED DECISION AND ORDER FINDING THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (RESPONDENT) HAD ENGAGED IN THE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT, AND RECOMMENDING THAT IT CEASE AND DESIST THEREFROM AND TAKE CERTAIN AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS AS SET FORTH IN THE ATTACHED JUDGE'S RECOMMENDED DECISION AND ORDER.
THEREAFTER, THE RESPONDENT FILED EXCEPTIONS TO THE JUDGE'S RECOMMENDED DECISION AND ORDER, AND A SUPPORTING BRIEF.
THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO SECTION 2423.29 OF THE AUTHORITY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS (5 CFR 2423.29) AND SECTION 7118 OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE (STATUTE), THE AUTHORITY HAS REVIEWED THE RULINGS OF THE JUDGE MADE AT THE HEARING AND FINDS THAT NO PREJUDICIAL ERROR WAS COMMITTED.
THE RULINGS ARE HEREBY AFFIRMED.
UPON CONSIDERATION OF THE JUDGE'S RECOMMENDED DECISION AND ORDER, AND THE ENTIRE RECORD IN THIS CASE, INCLUDING THE EXCEPTIONS AND SUPPORTING BRIEF OF THE RESPONDENT, THE AUTHORITY HEREBY ADOPTS THE JUDGE'S FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSISTENT HEREWITH.
THE COMPLAINT HEREIN ALLEGED THAT RESPONDENT VIOLATED SECTION 7116(A)(1) AND (2) OF THE STATUTE BY ITS ACTION IN REFUSING TO PROMOTE EMPLOYEE CAROL LA FOLLETTE TO THE POSITION OF REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE SHE FILED GRIEVANCES AND BECAUSE OF CONDUCT EXHIBITED DURING THE COURSE OF A GRIEVANCE MEETING.
THE RESPONDENT ASSERTED THAT LA FOLLETTE WAS NOT PROMOTED BECAUSE OF HER INTERVIEWS, HER LACK OF PRIOR EXPERIENCE AND FORMAL EDUCATION, AND A JUDGMENT, BASED ON INCIDENTS NOT CONNECTED WITH GRIEVANCES OR GRIEVANCE MEETINGS, THAT LA FOLLETTE COULD NOT HANDLE "PRESSURE SITUATIONS" WITH THE PUBLIC, WHICH WAS A REQUIREMENT OF THE POSITION.
THE RECORD REVEALS THAT EMPLOYEE CAROL LA FOLLETTE PARTICIPATED IN A GRIEVANCE MEETING IN MAY 1978, DURING WHICH SHE BECAME FRUSTRATED AND UPSET AND CONCLUDED THE MEETING BY TELLING BOTH THE PARTICIPATING MANAGEMENT AND UNION OFFICIALS TO "TAKE THEIR JOB AND GRIEVANCE AND SHOVE IT."
THE INCIDENT BECAME COMMON KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE EMPLOYEES AND SUPERVISORS THROUGHOUT THE OFFICE.
THEREAFTER, LA FOLLETTE APPLIED FOR THE POSITION OF REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE (TAX EXAMINER), AND WAS RANKED ON THE BEST-QUALIFIED LIST FOR THREE VACANCIES.
RESPONDENT DID NOT SELECT LA FOLLETTE, ASSERTING THAT HER INABILITY TO CONTROL HER TEMPER LED TO SERIOUS DOUBTS CONCERNING HER ABILITY TO DEAL ADEQUATELY WITH TAXPAYERS, AN INHERENT FEATURE OF THE WORK OF A REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE.
THE RESPONDENT CITED THREE INCIDENTS TO INDICATE LAFOLLETTE'S ADVERSE REACTION UNDER STRESS: (1) A DISAGREEMENT WITH A FELLOW CLERK; (2) A COUNSELING SESSION WITH A SUPERVISOR; AND, (3) AN EXTREMELY AGITATED INTERVIEW.
THE RESPONDENT ALSO ASSERTED THAT LAFOLLETTE'S ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS POSED DURING INTERVIEWS FOR TWO OF THE VACANCIES WERE SUBSTANTIVELY "SHALLOW," AND THAT LAFOLLETTE'S NOTICEABLE AND ADMITTED LACK OF SELF CONFIDENCE PERMEATED THE INTERVIEW SESSIONS.
THE RESPONDENT ADDS THAT LAFOLLETTE'S PRIOR EXPERIENCE, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, AND TEST SCORES AS COMPARED TO OTHER CANDIDATES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECISION NOT TO SELECT HER.
THE RESPONDENT DENIED THAT THE INCIDENT OCCURRING AT THE MAY 1978, GRIEVANCE MEETING WAS CONSIDERED IN THE DECISION NOT TO SELECT LA FOLLETTE FOR ONE OF THE POSITIONS BEING FILLED.
IN REACHING HIS CONCLUSIONS HEREIN, THE JUDGE FOUND THAT RESPONDENT HAD TAKEN LAFOLLETTE'S "PAST PROBLEMS AND DISPOSITION" AND "PAST HISTORY" INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN IT REFUSED TO SELECT HER FOR ONE OF THE VACANCIES FOR WHICH SHE HAD APPLIED.
THE JUDGE FURTHER FOUND THAT THIS CONSIDERATION HAD "NO DOUBT INCLUDED HER IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AT THE MAY 1978, GRIEVANCE MEETING. . . .
" ADDITIONALLY, THE JUDGE FOUND LAFOLLETTE'S BEHAVIOR AT THE MAY 1978, GRIEVANCE MEETING TO BE WITHIN THE AMBIT OF PROTECTED ACTIVITY, CITING VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REGIONAL OFFICE, DENVER, COLORADO, 2 FLRA NO. 84 (1980).
BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, THE JUDGE CONCLUDED THAT WHERE, AS HERE, A LEGITIMATE BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT ACTION EXISTS BUT UNION CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO SHOWN TO HAVE PLAYED A PART, AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE WILL BE FOUND, CITING THE AUTHORITY'S DECISION UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 11491, AS AMENDED, DIRECTORATE OF SUPPLY OPERATIONS, DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY, HEADQUARTERS, DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY, 2 FLRA NO. 118(1980).
THIS CASE IS ONE OF FIRST IMPRESSION UNDER THE STATUTE IN THAT IT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, AFFORDS THE AUTHORITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHAT TEST SHOULD BE APPLIED UNDER THE STATUTE IN SITUATIONS WHERE CONSIDERATIONS OF AN EMPLOYEE'S PARTICIPATION IN ACTIVITIES PROTECTED BY THE STATUTE PLAYED A PART IN A MANAGEMENT DECISION ADVERSELY AFFECTING THAT EMPLOYEE.
FOR THE REASONS WHICH FOLLOW, WE REJECT THE TEST APPLIED BY THE JUDGE AND DISAGREE WITH HIS CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE EXTENT REFLECTED HEREIN.
SECTION 7101(B) OF THE STATUTE PROVIDES:
IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER TO PRESCRIBE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE
EMPLOYEES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TO ESTABLISH PROCEDURES WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO MEET THE
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS OF THE GOVERNMENT.
THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CHAPTER SHOULD BE
INTERPRETED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT
GOVERNMENT.
SECTION 7102 OF THE STATUTE PROVIDES THAT "(E)ACH EMPLOYEE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORM, JOIN, OR ASSIST ANY LABOR ORGANIZATION, OR TO REFRAIN FROM ANY SUCH ACTIVITY, FREELY AND WITHOUT FEAR OF PENALTY OR REPRISAL, AND EACH EMPLOYEE SHALL BE PROTECTED IN THE EXERCISE OF SUCH RIGHT."
SECTION 7116(A)(1) AND (2) PROVIDES:
"(I)T SHALL BE AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE FOR AN AGENCY-- (1) TO INTERFERE WITH, RESTRAIN, OR
COERCE ANY EMPLOYEE IN THE EXERCISE BY THE EMPLOYEE OF ANY RIGHT UNDER THIS CHAPTER; (2) TO
ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE MEMBERSHIP IN ANY LABOR ORGANIZATION BY DISCRIMINATION IN CONNECTION
WITH HIRING, TENURE, PROMOTION, OR OTHER CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT (.)"
SECTION 7118(A)(7) AND (8) OF THE STATUTE PROVIDES THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL RESOLVE COMPLAINTS OF UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES, AND EITHER ISSUE AN APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL ORDER OR DISMISS THE COMPLAINT ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE ESTABLISHES THAT THE RESPONDENT HAS ENGAGED, OR IS ENGAGING IN, UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES.
IN DISCHARGING THIS RESPONSIBILITY IMPOSED BY THE STATUTE, THE AUTHORITY SEEKS TO PROTECT RIGHTS ASSURED BY THE STATUTE WITHOUT PRODUCING CONSEQUENCES INCONSISTENT WITH THE STATED PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE.
IN THIS REGARD, THE AUTHORITY NOTES THAT A RULE WHICH FOCUSES SOLELY ON WHETHER PROTECTED CONDUCT PLAYED A PART IN A MANAGEMENT DECISION FAILS TO CONSIDER "THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS OF THE GOVERNMENT" INCLUDING "THE REQUIREMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT."
THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE TEST APPLIED BY THE JUDGE IN THIS CASE IS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE PROMOTION OF AN EMPLOYEE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE UNION CONSIDERATIONS PLAYED A PART IN THE ORIGINAL PROMOTION DECISION-- EVEN IF THE SAME DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN REACHED APART FROM UNION CONSIDERATIONS.
AN AGENCY SHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEMPT TO PROVE THAT, APART FROM ANY CONSIDERATION OF PROTECTED ACTIVITIES, AN EMPLOYEE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROMOTED IN ANY EVENT.
IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE AUTHORITY FINDS THAT THE BURDEN IS ON THE GENERAL COUNSEL TO MAKE A PRIMA FACIE SHOWING THAT THE EMPLOYEE HAD ENGAGED IN PROTECTED ACTIVITY AND THAT THIS CONDUCT WAS A MOTIVATING FACTOR IN AGENCY MANAGEMENT'S DECISION NOT TO PROMOTE.
ONCE THIS IS ESTABLISHED, THE AGENCY MUST SHOW BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD HAVE REACHED THE SAME DECISION AS TO THE PROMOTION EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PROTECTED CONDUCT.
/1/
IN THE AUTHORITY'S VIEW, THE APPLICATION OF SUCH A TEST WILL SERVE TO BALANCE THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS AND PURPOSES OF GOVERNMENT WITH THOSE RIGHTS ASSURED TO EMPLOYEES AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES UNDER THE STATUTE.
SUCH A TEST SERVES THE PURPOSES OF THE STATUTE BY MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO MORE THOROUGHLY ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AGENCY ACTION AND THE PROTECTED CONDUCT OF AN EMPLOYEE.
UNDER THIS TEST, THEREFORE, BOTH THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND THE AGENCY WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDUCE EVIDENCE AS TO THE MOTIVATING FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE ACTION OR DECISION OF THE AGENCY WHICH IS THE BASIS OF THE COMPLAINT.
IF IT IS ESTABLISHED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THE SAME ACTION OR DECISION OF THE AGENCY WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PROTECTED ACTIVITY, A COMPLAINT OF VIOLATION OF SECTION 7116(A)(1) AND (2) OF THE STATUTE WILL NOT BE SUSTAINED.
CONVERSELY, IF IT IS NOT ESTABLISHED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THE ACTION OR DECISION WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN ANY EVENT, THE AUTHORITY WILL FIND A VIOLATION UNDER SECTION 7116(A)(1) AND (2) OF THE STATUTE.
IN APPLYING THE TEST DESCRIBED ABOVE TO THE INSTANT CASE, THE AUTHORITY CONCLUDES, IN AGREEMENT WITH THE JUDGE, THAT LA FOLLETTE WAS ENGAGED IN PROTECTED ACTIVITY DURING THE MAY 25, 1978, GRIEVANCE MEETING AND THAT RESPONDENT'S REFUSAL TO PROMOTE HER TO A REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITION WAS BASED, AT LEAST IN PART, ON UNION CONSIDERATIONS.
THE AUTHORITY FURTHER CONCLUDES THAT THE RESPONDENT ESTABLISHED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE HEARING, THAT LA FOLLETTE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR PROMOTION TO THE POSITION OF REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE EVEN IF LA FOLLETTE HAD NOT ENGAGED IN PROTECTED ACTIVITY.
IN THIS REGARD.
RESPONDENT CONTENDED THAT LA FOLLETTE WAS NOT SELECTED DUE TO, AMONG OTHER REASONS, HER HANDLING OF STRESS SITUATIONS AND HER DOUBTED ABILITY TO CONTROL HERSELF EMOTIONALLY.
THE RECORD ESTABLISHES SEVERAL INSTANCES, OTHER THAN THE GRIEVANCE MEETING INCIDENT, WHEREIN LA FOLLETTE HAD EMOTIONAL CONFRONTATIONS WITH HER FELLOW EMPLOYEES AND SUPERVISORS.
AS RECOGNIZED BY THE JUDGE (AT P. 6 OF HIS DECISION), "THE RECORD REVEALED AN EMOTIONAL AND AGITATED INDIVIDUAL WHO CANDIDLY ADMITTED DIFFICULTY WITH FELLOW EMPLOYEES AND WITH SUPERVISORS."
ADDITIONALLY, IN APPLYING THE TEST, THE AUTHORITY NOTES THAT THE SELECTING OFFICIAL FOR TWO OF THE VACANT POSITIONS TESTIFIED THAT UPON CONSIDERATION OF PRIOR EXPERIENCE, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, TEST SCORES, AND PARTICULARLY HIS INTERVIEWS OF THE APPLICANTS, HE CONSIDERED THREE OTHER CANDIDATES BETTER QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION THAN LA FOLLETTE.
THEREFORE, APPLYING THE PROPER TEST TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE, AND BASED ON CONSIDERATION OF THE ENTIRE RECORD, INCLUDING THE FINDINGS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE AUTHORITY CONCLUDES THAT THE AGENCY HAS ESTABLISHED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT LA FOLLETTE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR ANY OF THE REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITIONS EVEN IF SHE HAD NOT ENGAGED IN ANY PROTECTED ACTIVITY.
ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPLAINT WILL BE DISMISSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.
ORDER
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT THE COMPLAINT IN CASE NO. 3-CA-230 BE, AND IT HEREBY IS, DISMISSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.

DECISION
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
THIS CASE AROSE PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE, 5 U.S.C.
SECTION 7101, ET SEQ., AS A RESULT OF AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE FILED ON SEPTEMBER 21, 1979 AND AMENDED ON NOVEMBER 8, 1979.
COMPLAINT AND NOTICE OF HEARING ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 13, 1979 ALLEGING IN SUBSTANCE THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WASHINGTON, D.C.
HEREINAFTER CALLED "RESPONDENT" HAD VIOLATED 5 U.S.C. 7116(A)(1) AND (2) BY RESTRAINING ITS EMPLOYEES IN THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS GUARANTEED IN 5 U.S.C. 7102 AND DISCOURAGED MEMBERSHIP IN NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION, HEREINAFTER CALLED THE "UNION" BY FAILING TO PROMOTE EMPLOYEE CAROL LA FOLLETTE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO THE POSITION OF TAX EXAMINER (REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE).
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT.
A HEARING WAS HELD IN THIS MATTER IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA ON JANUARY 16, 1980.
ALL PARTIES WERE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND AFFORDED FULL OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD, ADDUCE RELEVANT EVIDENCE, EXAMINE AND CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES, AND TO FILE POST HEARING BRIEFS.
BASED UPON THE ENTIRE RECORD HEREIN, INCLUDING MY OBSERVATION OF THE WITNESSES AND THEIR DEMEANOR, THE EXHIBITS AND OTHER RELEVANT EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE HEARING, AND THE BRIEFS, I MAKE THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
FINDINGS OF FACT
AT ALL TIMES MATERIAL HEREIN, THE UNION WAS THE EXCLUSIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE OF RESPONDENT'S EMPLOYEES AT ITS DISTRICT OFFICE IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.
ABOUT MAY 25, 1978, CAROL LA FOLLETTE, A GRIEVANT, AND HER UNION REPRESENTATIVE, GENE FRIEDMAN, LOCAL UNION PRESIDENT, MET WITH CHARLES L. KURASZ, CHIEF, COLLECTION DIVISION OF THE INDIANAPOLIS DISTRICT AND OTHER MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS LA FOLLETTE'S IS THIRD STEP GRIEVANCE, AS REQUIRED BY THE TERMS OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.
AS MR. FRIEDMAN WAS PRESENTING THE GRIEVANCE AND MR. KURASZ WAS COMMENTING ON THE PRESENTATION AND DEFENDING MANAGEMENT'S POSITION, LA FOLLETTE BECAME FRUSTRATED AND UPSET AT WHAT SHE APPARENTLY PERCEIVED TO BE MERELY A DISCUSSION OF GENERALITIES, JUMPED UP, THREW HER PAPERS AND PENCIL DOWN ON THE TABLE AND IN AN ANGRY AND LOUD VOICE STATED THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL THAT SHE COULD GET A FAIR HEARING OR FAIR TREATMENT AND TOLD EACH OF THE PARTICIPANTS TO "TAKE THEIR JOB AND GRIEVANCE AND SHOVE IT."
SHE THEN WALKED OUT THE DOOR AND DID NOT RETURN TO THE MEETING.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, LA FOLLETTE APOLOGIZED TO KURASZ FOR HER ACTIONS.
LA FOLLETTE DROPPED HER UNION MEMBERSHIP FROM MAY 1978 UNTIL MARCH 1979.
THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THE OCCURRENCE AT THIS MEETING WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE AMONG EMPLOYEES AND SUPERVISORS OF THE DISTRICT OFFICE.
SUPERVISORS DAVID LARSON AND LAWRENCE MARTIN TESTIFIED THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE INCIDENT, THOUGH NOT PRESENT AT THE GRIEVANCE MEETING.
LA FOLLETTE TESTIFIED THAT HER SUPERVISOR MR. BLIGHTON TOLD HER DURING 1978, "I HEARD HOW YOU TOLD THEM TO STICK IT IN THEIR EAR." FRIEDMAN TESTIFIED THAT MR. BLIGHTON ALSO MENTIONED THE INCIDENT TO HIM. MR. KURASZ, IN A LATER GRIEVANCE MEETING TOLD FRIEDMAN THAT HE WAS NOT VINDICTIVE ABOUT THE INCIDENT.
AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT LA FOLLETTE WAS A GS-4 GROUP CLERK IN THE COLLECTION DIVISION.
SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 1978 LA FOLLETTE APPLIED FOR FOUR SEPARATE POSITIONS INCLUDING THAT OF TAX EXAMINER (REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE), ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS.
SHE WAS RANKED ON THE BEST-QUALIFIED LIST FOR THREE REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE OPENINGS IN MAY, JUNE AND AUGUST 1979, RESPECTIVELY, BY A RANKING PANEL, WHICH TOOK INTO ACCOUNT EMPLOYEE EVALUATIONS, WORK EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, TRAINING, AWARDS AND OTHER FACTORS.
ALSO, SHE WAS PLACED ON THE BEST QUALIFIED LIST FOR A CLERK TYPIST POSITION IN FEBRUARY 1979.
MS.
LA FOLLETTE ALSO PASSED RESPONDENT'S "MEET AND DEAL" INTERVIEW FOR THE POSITION.
ACCORDING TO RESPONDENT, THIS INTERVIEW IS STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR APPLICANTS FOR POSITIONS WITHIN THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE WHICH REQUIRE MEETING WITH THE PUBLIC.
IN MAY 1979 TWO VACANCIES FOR WHICH LA FOLLETTE APPLIED WERE FILLED BY ANOTHER EMPLOYEE OF THE COLLECTION DIVISION, AND AN APPLICANT FROM OUTSIDE THE INDIANAPOLIS DISTRICT, WHO HAD A RANKING SCORE LESS THAN LAFOLLETTE'S.
IN JUNE 1979, THREE VACANCIES FOR THE POSITION OF REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE WERE ADVERTISED AND THE THREE APPLICANTS SELECTED WERE FROM OUTSIDE THE COLLECTION DIVISION AND TWO WITH LOWER SCORES THAN LA FOLLETTE WERE SELECTED.
FOR THE AUGUST 1979 POSITION, ALTHOUGH TWO VACANCIES WERE ADVERTISED ONLY ONE WAS FILLED, BY AN EMPLOYEE FROM OUTSIDE THE COLLECTION DIVISION, AND THE OTHER VACANCY WAS READVERTISED AT A SUPERVISORY LEVEL, BECAUSE THE SUPERVISOR MR. MARTIN TESTIFIED THERE WAS A GREATER NEED TO FILL THE POSITION AT A SUPERVISORY LEVEL BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE FREEZE.
BEFORE FILING THE GRIEVANCE WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE MAY 1978 MEETING, LA FOLLETTE HAD BEEN PROMOTED FROM A GS-3 TO GS-4 BY RESPONDENT.
SINCE THE GRIEVANCE MEETING LA FOLLETTE HAS NOT BEEN PROMOTED BECAUSE ALLEGEDLY SHE COULD NOT CONTROL HER TEMPER, CREATING ACCORDING TO RESPONDENT, SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HER MEETING TAX PAYERS, AN INHERENT PART OF THE WORK OF A REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE.
THE RECORD REVEALED THAT MS.
LA FOLLETTE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN MEETING AND DEALING WITH TAX PAYERS.
IN THIS REGARD, DURING 1979, SHE WORKED AS A RECEPTIONIST/TAX EXAMINER, WHERE HER DUTIES INVOLVED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GREETING TAX PAYERS WHO CAME IN TO PAY DELINQUENT TAX BILLS, RETRIEVING INFORMATION ON THEIR ACCOUNTS, BRINGING THEIR ACCOUNTS UP TO DATE, DETERMINING THE ACCRUALS OF PENALTIES ON ACCOUNTS, AND SITTING DOWN WITH THE TAX PAYER TO ESTABLISH A PAYMENT PLAN.
RESPONDENT'S WITNESSES TESTIFIED THAT CLERICAL DUTIES DIFFER WIDELY FROM THE DUTIES OF A REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE.
THERE IS NO RECORD EVIDENCE OF ANY EMOTIONAL OUTBURSTS WHEN LA FOLLETTE DEALT WITH TAX PAYERS OR THAT SHE DEALT WITH TAX PAYERS IN OTHER THAN A LEVEL HEADED MANNER.
FURTHER, HER APPRAISAL FOR THE AUGUST 1979 REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT COVERING THIS TIME PERIOD, WAS EXCELLENT.
AN EARLIER APPRAISAL COVERING THE PERIOD MAY 1978 TO MARCH 1979 INDICATED THAT ALTHOUGH LA FOLLETTE HAD DIFFICULTY IN BEING SENSITIVE TO OTHERS IN STRESS SITUATIONS IN THE PAST, THERE WAS IMPROVEMENT AND THERE HAD BEEN NO RECURRENCE IN SIMILAR STRESS SITUATIONS.
AMONG THE INCIDENTS CITED BY RESPONDENT TO ESTABLISH DIFFICULTY IN STRESS SITUATIONS WITNESSES TESTIFIED THAT LA FOLLETTE HAD A DISAGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER GROUP CLERK AND HAD BECOME EMOTIONALLY UPSET; SHE HAD BEEN COUNSELLED BY SUPERVISOR MARTIN FOR GREETING A TAX PAYER IN STOCKING FEET AND THAT SHE HAD TOLD HIM THAT "(H)E WAS OUT TO GET HER"; AND, DURING AN INTERVIEW CONDUCTED BY, SUPERVISOR DAVID LARSON, SHE HAD BECOME "VERY, VERY AGITATED" AND "STARTED TO LOSE CONTROL."
THE SELECTING OFFICIAL FOR THE FIRST TWO VACANCIES WAS SUPERVISOR DAVID LARSON, SUPERVISOR MARTIN ASSISTED WITH THE INTERVIEWS.
CONCERNING THE INTERVIEW FOR THE JUNE 1979 POSITION, MR. LARSON TESTIFIED THAT LAFOLLETTE'S ANSWERS WERE "SHALLOW" AND THAT SHE ADMITTED A LACK OF SELF CONFIDENCE IN HER ABILITY TO HANDLE PRESSURE SITUATIONS.
ACCORDING TO LARSON, ALTHOUGH THE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL PREVIOUSLY PREPARED BY LAFOLLETTE'S MANAGER INDICATED SHE WAS ABLE TO COPE WITH STRESS, HER PERFORMANCE AT THE INTERVIEWS INDICATED OTHERWISE.
IN ADDITION, MR. LARSON REFERRED TO HER LACK OF PRIDE IN THE WORK SHE WAS DOING AND OTHER RESPONSES WHICH DEMONSTRATED TO HIM THAT OTHER CANDIDATES HAD BETTER POTENTIAL FOR THE REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITION.
MR. LARSON TESTIFIED THAT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION PRIOR EXPERIENCE, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, TEST SCORES, AND PARTICULARLY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE INTERVIEWS, HE CONSIDERED THREE OTHER CANDIDATES BETTER QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION THAN LA FOLLETTE.
MR. LARSON, WHO IS A UNION MEMBER, TESTIFIED THAT HE DID NOT INQUIRE INTO LAFOLLETTE'S UNION ACTIVITIES AND DID NOT CONSIDER THE MAY 1978 GRIEVANCE MEETING IN MAKING HIS SELECTION.
SUPERVISOR LARRY MARTIN, WHO WAS THE SELECTING OFFICIAL FOR SEVERAL POSITIONS APPLIED FOR BY LA FOLLETTE, TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS TOLD AROUND MAY 1978 OF LA FOLLETTE ACTIVITY DURING THE GRIEVANCE MEETING WITH MR. KURASZ.
LA FOLLETTE TESTIFIED THAT MR. MARTIN TOLD HER, AFTER HE HAD BEEN SELECTED CHIEF OF THE DIVISION, THAT SHE "WOULD SOON FIND OUT THAT THERE (WERE) WAYS OF TELLING PEOPLE THINGS THAT (SHE) WANTED THEM TO KNOW ABOUT WITHOUT RECEIVING REPRISALS FROM THEM."
MARTIN TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH LA FOLLETTE IN WHICH IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, "YOU CANNOT GET ANYWHERE IF YOU SLAM THE DOOR ON THE CHIEF OF COLLECTIONS."
DURING THE INTERVIEW FOR THE AUGUST 1979 POSTING, LA FOLLETTE TESTIFIED THAT MARTIN MENTIONED THAT IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN HER AND HER PAST HISTORY OF BECOMING UPSET DURING STRESS SITUATIONS THAT HE WOULD ONLY GO ON THE INTERVIEWS AND HER EVALUATION; BUT SINCE HE KNEW HER, HE WAS ALSO TAKING HER PAST HISTORY INTO CONSIDERATION.
UNION STEWARD FRIEDMAN TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS TOLD BY MARTIN ON AUGUST 23, 1979, THAT HE KNEW THAT THE UNION HAD QUITE A FEW GRIEVANCES WITH LA FOLLETTE AND HE HAD JUST INTERVIEWED HER FOR THE REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITION AGAIN.
MARTIN ADDED THAT THE INTERVIEW WAS "ONE OF THE FINEST INTERVIEWS HE HAD EVER HAD."
ACCORDING TO FRIEDMAN, MARTIN ALSO STATED THAT EXCEPT FOR "HER PAST PROBLEMS AND HER DISPOSITION" HE WOULD HAVE SELECTED HER FOR THE REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITION.
FRIEDMAN WAS, OF COURSE, AWARE OF THE GRIEVANCE MEETING INCIDENT AND HE WAS ALSO AWARE OF THE INCIDENT INVOLVING A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN LA FOLLETTE AND ANOTHER GROUP CLERK.
MARTIN TESTIFIED THAT DURING THIS CONVERSATION HE TOLD FRIEDMAN THAT THE INTERVIEW WITH LA FOLLETTE, WHO HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED BY HIM ON TWO OTHER OCCASIONS, HAD BEEN ONE OF HER BEST INTERVIEWS.
HE ALSO TESTIFIED THAT HE TOLD FRIEDMAN THAT HE HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT HER ABILITY TO HANDLE HERSELF IN PRESSURE SITUATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.
MARTIN CITED SEVERAL INCIDENTS INVOLVING LAFOLLETTE'S PROBLEMS WITH MANAGEMENT AND OFFICE PERSONNEL.
MARTIN DENIED THAT UNION MEMBERSHIP WAS EVER A CONSIDERATION IN HIS APPRAISAL OF MS.
LA FOLLETTE.
HE ALSO TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS A UNION MEMBER.
ON AUGUST 23, 1979, LA FOLLETTE HAD TWO SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ACTING CHIEF OF REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE SECTION A, NANCY DURHAM WHO HAD ASSISTED MR. MARTIN IN THE INTERVIEWS FOR THE POSITION.
DURING THE FIRST CONVERSATION MS. DURHAM INFORMED LA FOLLETTE THAT THEY HAD INTERVIEWED SOMEONE WHO REALLY HAD A FANTASTIC INTERVIEW AND THEY WERE GOING TO SELECT THIS APPLICANT.
MARTIN'S TESTIMONY CONFIRMED THAT ONE APPLICANT WAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE OTHERS.
UPON LEARNING THAT THE APPLICANT DID NOT ACCEPT THE JOB, LA FOLLETTE RETURNED TO MS. DURHAM'S OFFICE, AGAIN ASKING IF SHE HAD A CHANCE.
AT THAT TIME, MS. DURHAM TOLD HER THAT "THE WAY SHE UNDERSTOOD IT AS TO WHY I WAS NOT BEING SELECTED, WAS BECAUSE THEY-- WANTED ME TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE PROBLEMS ON MY OWN WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM THE UNION."
MS. DURHAM DENIED MAKING ANY COMMENTS ABOUT LAFOLLETTE'S UNION ACTIVITIES.
SHE TESTIFIED THAT SHE TOLD LA FOLLETTE THAT IN HER OPINION, LA FOLLETTE WAS NOT SELECTED BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT READY TO MEET AND DEAL WITH TAX PAYERS, AND/OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES SINCE THEY OFTEN BECAME ABUSIVE OR USED DEROGATORY LANGUAGE AND THAT SHE DID NOT THINK THAT LA FOLLETTE WAS QUITE READY FOR THAT.
MS. DURHAM EXPRESSED THAT SHE WAS NOT THE SELECTING OFFICIAL AND THAT ANYTHING THAT SHE SAID WAS BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.
MS. DURHAM LATER TESTIFIED THAT SHE HAD BEEN WARNED PRIOR TO ASSUMING HER POSITION AS ACTING MANAGER "TO WATCH YOUR GROUP CLERK" AND THAT SHE HAD HEARD OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE SECTION MENTION "THAT SHE HAD FILED GRIEVANCES."
SOMETIME DURING SEPTEMBER 1978, WILLIAM MCCLOSKEY, A SELECTING OFFICIAL FOR A TAX EXAMINER POSITION FOR WHICH LA FOLLETTE DID NOT MAKE THE BEST QUALIFIED LIST TOLD HER THAT SHE DID NOT GET THE POSITION FOR WHICH HE WAS SELECTING OFFICIAL BECAUSE SHE "HAD STEPPED ON OTHERS' TOES."
MCCLOSKEY DID NOT APPEAR AS A WITNESS.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
CASE LAW IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAS ESTABLISHED THAT IN ORDER TO SHOW A VIOLATION BASED ON NON-SELECTION THE EVIDENCE MUST SHOW THAT AGENCY MANAGEMENT HAS DISCRIMINATORILY AFFECTED EMPLOYEE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT BASED ON UNION CONSIDERATIONS.
FURTHER, SUCH A VIOLATION WILL BE FOUND IN "MIXED MOTIVE" SITUATIONS, I.E., WHERE A LEGITIMATE BASIS FOR THE MANAGEMENT ACTION EXISTS, BUT WHERE UNION CONSIDERATIONS ALSO ARE SHOWN TO HAVE PLAYED A PART.
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE, SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, BUREAU OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS, REGION II, SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, 8 A/SLMR 1092, 1093, A/SLMR NO. 1127(1978); U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, MILWAUKEE AREA OFFICE, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN, 7 A/SLMR 948, 949, A/SLMR NO. 925(1977); DIRECTORATE OF SUPPLY OPERATIONS, DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY, HEADQUARTERS, DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY, 2 FLRC NO. 118(1980).
THUS, IT IS ONLY NECESSARY THAT IT BE ESTABLISHED THAT ONE OF THE REASONS FOR AGENCY MANAGEMENTS' REFUSAL TO SELECT LA FOLLETTE WAS BASED ON HER UNION OR PROTECTED ACTIVITY.
THE THRESHOLD QUESTION IN THIS MATTER IS WHETHER OR NOT LA FOLLETTE WAS ENGAGED IN PROTECTED ACTIVITY AT THE TIME OF THE MAY 1978 GRIEVANCE MEETING.
THE AUTHORITY HAS SAID AT THAT THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE IS AN INTEGRAL AND FUNDAMENTAL PART OF A LABOR ORGANIZATION'S RIGHT TO EFFECTIVELY REPRESENT EMPLOYEES.
VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION REGIONAL OFFICE, DENVER, COLORADO, 2 FLRA 84(1980).
FURTHER, IT HAS STATED THAT AN EMPLOYEE'S RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN PROTECTED ACTIVITY PERMITS LEEWAY FOR IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR, WHICH IS BALANCED AGAINST THE EMPLOYER'S RIGHT TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND RESPECT FOR ITS SUPERVISORY STAFF ON THE JOB SITE.
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, PUGET SOUND NAVAL SHIPYARD, BREMERTON, WASHINGTON, 2 FLRC 107(1980).
AND TO REMOVE THE CONDUCT FROM THE AMBIT OF PROTECTED ACTIVITY, THE EMPLOYEE MUST BE FOUND TO HAVE ENGAGED IN FLAGRANT MISCONDUCT.
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, HEADQUARTERS, MILITARY TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, 2 FLRC 72(1980).
WHILE THESE CASES INVOLVE MISCONDUCT ATTRIBUTED TO UNION REPRESENTATIVES SERVING IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES, IT IS MY VIEW THAT THE SAME PROTECTION EXTENDS TO EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS IN GRIEVANCE PROCEEDINGS.
PARTICULARLY WHERE SUCH MISCONDUCT IS ATTRIBUTED TO STATEMENTS MADE REGARDING THE EMPLOYEE'S OWN GRIEVANCE.
ALTHOUGH I DO NOT CONDONE LAFOLLETTE'S CONDUCT DURING THIS MEETING, SHE WAS ENGAGED IN NEITHER FLAGRANT MISCONDUCT NOR DID SHE USE ABUSIVE LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD DESTROY MANAGEMENT'S RIGHT TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND RESPECT WHICH WOULD REMOVE HER ACTIONS FROM PROTECTED STATUS.
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS FOUND THAT LA FOLLETTE WAS ENGAGED IN PROTECTED ACTIVITY DURING THE MAY 25, 1978 GRIEVANCE MEETING AND THAT HER CONDUCT AT THE MEETING WAS NOT BEYOND THE AMBIT OF PROTECTED ACTIVITY.
TURNING TO RESPONDENT'S CONTENTION THAT IT DID NOT SELECT LA FOLLETTE FOR PROMOTION BECAUSE OF HER HANDLING OF STRESS SITUATIONS AND HER DOUBTED ABILITY TO CONTROL HERSELF EMOTIONALLY.
THE RECORD REVEALED AN EMOTIONAL AND AGITATED INDIVIDUAL WHO CANDIDLY ADMITTED DIFFICULTY WITH FELLOW EMPLOYEES AND WITH SUPERVISORS.
HOWEVER, THESE INCIDENTS OCCURRED WHEN SHE WAS BEING COUNSELLED BY SUPERVISION, OR DURING INTERVIEWS AND DURING A SINGLE INSTANCE OF INTEMPERANCE WITH ANOTHER GROUP CLERK.
WHILE RESPONDENT MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS CONCERNED WITH HER ABILITY TO DEAL WITH TAXPAYERS OR THE PUBLIC THERE IS NOT A SINGLE INSTANCE CITED TO SHOW THAT SHE WOULD EXPERIENCE SUCH DIFFICULTY ALTHOUGH LA FOLLETTE HAD DEALT WITH THE PUBLIC OVER A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME AND SHE HAD PASSED THE "MEET AND DEAL" INTERVIEW.
CERTAINLY LA FOLLETTE ACTIONS IN BECOMING EMOTIONAL AND AGITATED WITH OTHERS IN THE OFFICE WOULD RAISE SOME CONCERN AS TO HER SUITABILITY FOR PROMOTION TO REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE BUT, RESPONDENT'S NONSELECTIONS OF AN EMPLOYEE CONSISTENTLY RATED ON ITS BEST QUALIFIED LIST WERE NOT BASED ON THESE ACTIONS ALONE.
I CREDIT UNION PRESIDENT FRIEDMAN'S ACCOUNT OF THE AUGUST 23, 1979 CHANCE MEETING WITH SUPERVISOR MARTIN IN WHICH HE WAS TOLD BY MARTIN THAT LA FOLLETTE WOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THAT POSITION EXCEPT FOR "HER PAST PROBLEMS AND HER DISPOSITION."
ALSO I CREDIT LAFOLLETTE'S TESTIMONY THAT MARTIN TOLD HER DURING THE AUGUST 1979 INTERVIEW THAT HE WAS TAKING HER "PAST HISTORY INTO CONSIDERATION."
LAFOLLETTE'S PAST PROBLEMS NO DOUBT INCLUDED HER IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AT THE MAY 1978 GRIEVANCE MEETING AND THIS INCIDENT WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE EMPLOYEES AND SUPERVISORS AT THE OFFICE.
FURTHERMORE, LA FOLLETTE HAD SEEMINGLY BECOME MORE OF A PROBLEM SINCE SHE HAD FILED SEVERAL GRIEVANCES SINCE MAY 1978 WHICH PROBLEM WAS POINTED OUT TO HER BY SUPERVISOR DURHAM DURING ONE OF THEIR AUGUST 23, 1979 CONVERSATIONS.
WHILE IT IS CLEAR FROM THE RECORD THAT LA FOLLETTE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR ANY OF THE REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITIONS DURING 1979 BECAUSE OF HER LACK OF FORMAL TRAINING AND THE DIFFICULTY IN RISING FROM A CLERICAL POSITION, IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR, THAT IN EVALUATING HER PROMOTION POTENTIAL, AT LEAST SUPERVISOR MARTIN, WHO WAS ON INTERVIEW PANELS FOR JOBS APPLIED FOR BY LA FOLLETTE DURING MAY AND JUNE 1979 AND WHO WAS THE SELECTING OFFICIAL FOR AN AUGUST 1979 POSITION, HAD TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT HER PAST HISTORY AND DISPOSITION AND SUCH AN APPRAISAL COULD NOT IGNORE HER ACTIONS AT THE MAY 1978 GRIEVANCE MEETING.
THEREFORE, I AM CONSTRAINED TO FIND THAT ANY CONSIDERATION OF HER PAST HISTORY INCLUDED THE MAY 1978 PROTECTED ACTIVITY AND THAT RESPONDENT'S REFUSAL TO PROMOTE LA FOLLETTE TO A REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITION, AS EARLY AS MAY 1979, /2/ WAS BASED AT LEAST, IN PART, ON UNION CONSIDERATIONS.
TO ALLOW AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES TO DENY PROMOTIONS BASED ON AN EMPLOYEES' FILING OF GRIEVANCES OR UPON CONSIDERATIONS OF AN EMPLOYEE DURING GRIEVANCE MEETINGS, WHERE SUCH ACTION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FLAGRANT MISCONDUCT OR INSUBORDINATION, IN MY VIEW INTERFERES WITH EMPLOYEE'S RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE STATUTE.
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS FOUND THAT RESPONDENT VIOLATED SECTION 7116(A)(1) AND (2) OF THE STATUTE BY ALLOWING ANY PART OF LAFOLLETTE'S PROTECTED ACTIVITY TO PLAY A ROLE IN ITS DETERMINATION OF HER FITNESS AND OR SELECTION FOR PROMOTION.
RECOMMENDATION
HAVING FOUND THAT RESPONDENT HAS ENGAGED IN CERTAIN CONDUCT WHICH IS VIOLATIVE OF SECTIONS 7116(A)(1) AND (2) OF THE STATUTE, BY VIRTUE OF ITS ACTIONS IN ALLOWING LAFOLLETTE'S ACTIVITIES AS A GRIEVANT TO PLAY A ROLE IN HER SELECTION FOR PROMOTION, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY ADOPT THE FOLLOWING ORDER DESIGNED TO EFFECTUATE THE POLICIES OF THE STATUTE.
RECOMMENDED ORDER
PURSUANT TO 5 U.S.C. 7118(A)(7) AND SECTION 2423.26 OF THE FINAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, 45 FED.REG.
3482, 3510(1980), IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WASHINGTON, D.C.
SHALL:
1.
CEASE AND DESIST FROM:
(A) FAILING TO PROMOTE CAROL LA FOLLETTE OR ANY OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE UTILIZED THEIR
RIGHTS UNDER THE STATUTE TO FILE AND PROCESS GRIEVANCES.
(B) DISCOURAGING MEMBERSHIP IN THE NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION, OR ANY OTHER LABOR
ORGANIZATION, BY DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT TO ANY TERM OR CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT, BASED UPON
CONSIDERATION OF UNION MEMBERSHIP OR ACTIVITY.
(C) IN ANY LIKE OR RELATED MANNER, INTERFERING WITH, RESTRAINING, OR COERCING ITS EMPLOYEES
IN THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS ASSURED BY THE STATUTE.
2.
TAKE THE FOLLOWING AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE THE PURPOSES AND PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE:

/1/ CF. MT. HEALTHY CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION V. DOYLE, 429 U.S. 274(1977) (INVOLVING CONDUCT PROTECTED BY THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.
/2/ AT THE HEARING RESPONDENT ARGUED THAT LA FOLLETTE ELECTED TO RAISE THE QUESTION OF HER JUNE 1979 NONSELECTION TO A REVENUE REPRESENTATIVE POSITION UNDER THE CONTRACTUAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND HAD THEREFORE FORECLOSED HER RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT ACTION UNDER SECTION 7116(D).
THE COMPLAINT IN THIS MATTER ALLEGED A CONTINUING COURSE OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LA FOLLETTE BEGINNING ABOUT FEBRUARY 1979.
IF THE ALLEGED UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE INVOLVED ONLY THE JUNE 1979 NONSELECTION, SECTION 7116(D) MIGHT INDEED BAR JURISDICTION.
HOWEVER, IN THIS PROCEEDING THE JUNE 1979 NONSELECTION CONSTITUTES ONLY A PART OF THE NONSELECTIONS WHICH IT IS ALLEGED SHOWS A PATTERN OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LA FOLLETTE AND THE ISSUE HEREIN IS WHETHER SUCH A PATTERN EXISTED AND NOT WHETHER THE PARTICULAR NONSELECTION WAS PROPER.
ACCORDINGLY, I FIND RESPONDENT'S CONTENTION THAT JURISDICTION IS PRECLUDED BECAUSE THE JUNE 1979 NONSELECTION WAS GRIEVED TO BE WITHOUT MERIT.
