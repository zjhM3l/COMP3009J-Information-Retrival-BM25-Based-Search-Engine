[ars150.gif] TEKTRAN __________________________________________________________________ THE ORIGIN OF GENOMIC DUPLICATIONS IN ARABIDOPSIS Author(s): VISION TODD J BROWN D G TANKSLEY S D Interpretive Summary: Large segmental duplications cover much of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome.
Little is known about their origins.
We show that they are primarily due to at least four different large-scale duplication events that occurred 100-200 million years ago, a formative period in the diversification of the angiosperms.
A better understanding the complex structural history of angiosperm genomes is necessary in order to make full use of arabidopsis as a genetic model for other plant species.
