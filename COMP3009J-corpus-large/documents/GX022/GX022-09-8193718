Biogeochemical characteristics of wetlands developed after strip mining for coal.
Sistani, K. R.; Mays, D. A.; Taylor, R. W.
Commun-soil-sci-plant-anal v.26, p.3221-3229.
(1995).
Includes references.
Descriptors: wetlands-; disturbed-soils; mined-land; reclamation-; biogeochemistry-; characterization-; chemical-composition; wetland-soils; comparisons-; alabama-; constructed-wetlands-versus-natural-wetlands Abstract: Since the costly practice of toxic spoil burial and topsoil replacement during surface mine reclamation are mandated by law, it has become feasible to consider creation of constructed wetlands for wildlife habitat as an alternative mined land reclamation practice on active or abandoned mine sites.
This is also a novel approach for metigation of lost natural wetland in the past.
Implementation of this concept will require proper baseline information from the biogeochemical properties of constructed wetlands developed on surface mined sites.
Baseline data were collected from two wetlands developed on strip mined sites in Alabama.
We took samples from each wetland in April and September 1992.
Since the naturalization of these wetlands with regard to the spatial variabilities within each wetland were the main objective of this work, a natural wetland developed on undisturbed soil was sampled at the same time so that it could be used as a reference to wetlands developed on disturbed soils.
The natural wetland was dominated by cattail (Typha latifolia) and smartweed (Polygonum sp.) while the dominant emergent vegetation of the stripmined site wetlands was bulrush (Scirpus sp.) and cattail.
The pH of the mineral and organic substrate in the natural wetland ranged from 7.7 to 7.8 while in the mined-site wetlands, pH ranged from 6.7 to 7.4.
Dry soil adjacent to mined site wetlands had pHs of 4.1 and 5.0, compared to 6.5 for dry soil adjacent to the natural wetland.
Higher levels of extractable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) were measured in April than September for all wetlands.
Metal concentrations did not show any consistent trend.
coal will gain biogeochemical characteristics similar to those of natural wetlands regardless of the initial chemical characteristics of the mined spoil materials.
However, more studies with regard to the direct comparison of constructed versus natural wetlands at different locations is warranted.

Comparing microbial parameters in natural and constructed wetlands.

Descriptors: wetlands-; pollution-control; water-quality; microbial-activities; biomass-production; soil-organic-matter; soil-ph; soil-water; denitrification-; enzyme-activity; mineralization-; nitrification-; massachusetts-; rhode-island Abstract: Microbial biomass C, soil respiration, denitrification enzyme activity (DEA), and potential net N mineralization and nitrification were compared in two constructed and three natural wetlands in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
The constructed wetlands studied had marsh and wet meadow vegetation and received storm water discharge directly from a large shopping mall and its associated parking lots.
The natural sites encompassed three soil drainage classes (moderately well drained, poorly drained, and very poorly drained) across an upland to wetland transition zone with red maple (Acer rubrum L.) swamps and mixed oak (Quercus sp.) forests in the transition zone.
Our objective was to determine if microbial biomass and activity were similar in the constructed wetlands and the most common type of natural wetland in our area.
Microbial biomass C, DEA, and potential net N mineralization and nitrification were similar among the constructed and natural wetland sites.
In all cases, levels of these parameters in the constructed wetlands fell within the range of variability observed in the natural wetlands.
Denitrification enzyme activity was higher (p 
Soil respiration was generally lower (p 
The results suggest that the constructed wetlands have a significant and active microbial community that facilitates nutrient cycling and water quality maintenance functions similar to natural wetlands.
The successful development of the microbial community n these wetlands was likely due to the use of organic substrates.

Paper presented at the symposium, "Wetland Processes and Water Quality," November 3-4, 1992, Minneapolis, MN. Descriptors: organic-matter; sediment-; peat-soils; decomposition-; cycling-; oxygen-; nitrate-nitrogen; ammonium-nitrogen; sulfate-; water-pollution; water-quality; marshes-; pollution-control Abstract: Constructed marshes are currently being used as a low-cost alternative for treatment of nutrient-enriched waters.
These marshes may function as net sinks for nutrients, especially for particulate organic forms of N and P. However, decomposition of organic matter and nutrient release may influence the ability of the marsh to function for this purpose.
One of the main factors affecting decomposition is the availability of inorganic electron acceptors (e.g., O2, NO3(-), and SO4(2-).
The role of electron acceptor consumption on N and P regeneration and release was investigated using batch incubation experiments with recently deposited organic matter (floc sediment) and peat soils collected from the constructed marsh.
In electron acceptor-amended soil cores, electron acceptor consumption proceeded rapidly in the order O2 
Mean oxygen reduction rate (OR) was 1.6 g O2 m-2 d-1 (2025 g O2 m-3 d-1), with corresponding values for NO3(-) and SO4(2-) of 0.23 g N m-2 d-1 (60 g N m-3 d-1) and 0.086 g S m-2 d-1 (5.4 g S m-3 d-1), respectively.
If electron acceptor consumption was coupled to decomposition of organic matter in Hoc sediment with a C/N/P ratio of 190:14:1, aerobic catabolism accounted for 92% of NH4+, and soluble P regenerated in the soil, with anaerobic activity (NO3(-) and SO4(2-) reduction) accounting for the remaining 8%.
In the constructed marsh receiving allochthonous inputs of labile organic matter, however, anaerobic decomposition was expected to be the dominant mechanism for nutrient regeneration.
Under SO4(2-)-reducing conditions, net rates of organic N and P mineralization were 3.3 to 14 mg N L-1 sediment d-1 and 0.5 to 0.6 mg P L-1, respectively, and were highly.

Descriptors: wetlands-; bogs-; solutes-; contaminants-; transport-processes; hydraulic-conductivity; rain-; evaporation-; pollution-control; newfoundland- Abstract: A field-scale, natural gradient solute transport experiment conducted at a Newfoundland blanket bog resulted in an asymmetrical plume owing to solute retardation in the dual-porosity matrix.
An order of magnitude decrease in hydraulic conductivity 10-20 m downslope of the spill caused the transport rate to decrease and lateral dispersion to increase.
Most transport occurred near the watertable and the transport rate increased as the watertable rose.
Hydraulic conductivity between a depth of 0 and 0.2 m was 1.6 X 10(-2) m s-1, whereas at a depth of 0.5 m it was 5-6 orders of magnitude lower owing to greater compaction and humification of the peat with depth.
At a depth of 0.4-0.45 m diffusion may have become the dominant transport mechanism.
In spite of the retardation process, the solute front's rate of movement was relatively high, about 2.3 m day-1, owing to a combination of the high watertable during the study and a relatively steep hydraulic gradient of 0.055.
Rain caused dilution and mixing of solute near the watertable.
Evaporation did not have an appreciable effect on solute concentration, which is attributable to the high transport rate.

A system for measuring NO3- uptake was designed, built and tested.
Specific design goals, which were met, include: low handling shock to the plants, high measurement accuracy (4%), high temporal resolution (10 min) and minimal mass- transfer limitations to uptake.
Important design factors were identified and the overall uncertainties in the reported measurements were computed.
The observed uptake rates were dependent on the NO3- concentration ([NO3-]) to which the plants were exposed for the 24 h prior to testing; plants pretreated at higher [NO3-]

A Michaelis-Menten kinetic model was applied, allowing the uptake kinetics to be characterized by two parameters: the apparent half-velocity constant, Km, and the apparent maximum uptake rate, Vmax.
A propagation of uncertainty calculation revealed that the kinetic parameters could be determined with a high degree of accuracy; the standard deviation in Km was typically 15% of the Km value; the standard deviation in Vmax was typically 7% of the Vmax value.
The plants were exposed to full nutrient solutions containing NO3- at 50, 200, 500 and 800 micromolar for 24 h prior to kinetic testing, and both Km and Vmax were found to vary with pretreatment NO3- concentration, [NO3-]; plants pretreated at high [NO3- had lower Vmax and higher Km values than plants pretreated at lower [NO3-]
However, the variations in Vmax were more consistent than those in Km.
These changes in the kinetic parameters reflect an uptake system which is capable of compensating for changes in the external [NO3-] to maintain a virtually constant NO3- uptake rate in the range studied.
Changes in Km and Vmax begin within 4 h of a change in [NO3-].
Light deprivation during pretreatment in 200 micromolar NO3- resulted in a complete cessation of NO3- uptake; 4-8 h of illumination were required before the uptake resumed, and uptake rates had not yet reached normal levels 8 h after the resumption of illumination.

Descriptors: wetlands-; mine-spoil; drainage-; waste-treatment; mineralogy-; iron-; chemical-precipitation; solubility-; mineralogy-; constructed-wetlands Abstract: Precipitates forming at various stages of acid mine drainage treatment in a high metal load (approximately 1000 mg L-1 Fe) and low pH (approximately 3) constructed wetland were characterized by chemical dissolution, X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy.
Minerals precipitating in flumes and in entry wetland cells lacking vegetation included poorly crystalline ferrihydrite, lepidocrocite, goethite, possibly an akaganeite-like mineral, and high Fe/S ratio Fe oxyhydroxysulfates (similar to schwertmannite).
Within vegetated wetland cells lined with crushed limestone, well-crystallized gypsum, lepidocrocite, and Fe-oxyhydroxysulfate minerals with low Fe/S ratios were accompanied by gradual reductions in ferrihydrite and akaganeite.
The Fe/S molar ratios of Fe oxyhydroxysulfates in flume precipitates averaged 5.2 +/- 0.3, while those of cell precipitates averaged approximately 3.5 +/- 0.5.
The oxalate-extractable (Fe(ox)) to total (Fe(t)) Fe fraction of the precipitates was considerably higher in wetland cells (1.1 +/- 0.3), where organic C was 10-fold higher than in entry flumes (0.7 +/- 0.1).
Scanning electron micrographs of flume precipitates showed a fiber-like morphology of densely aggregated spherical particles, 1.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, with a closely packed microcrystalline matrix.
Precipitates collected from vegetated wetland cells formed aggregates of somewhat smaller diameter spherical particles with grassy surfaces or finger-like projections entangled with bacterial cells.
The overall composition of the precipitates suggested that the Fe chemistry is controlled primarily by the solubility of Fe oxyhydroxides in flumes and by S-enriched Fe oxyhydroxysulfates. inhibited by the presence of organics and the precipitation of Fe oxyhydroxysulfates and gypsum.

Descriptors: wetland-soils; phosphorus-; sorption-; kinetics-; sorption-isotherms; physicochemical-properties; waste-water-treatment Abstract: Wetlands function as buffers for nutrients loaded from terrestrial ecosystems through drainage and surface discharges.
The objectives of our study were to (i) determine the P retention capacity of representative wetlands soils being used for disposal of treated wastewater and (ii) relate P retention characteristics to selected physicochemical properties to evaluate likely of P removal in the soils.
Intact soil cores (0-40 cm) and bulk soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected from a system of natural and constructed wetlands currently being used for disposal of treated wastewater.
Floodwater P concentrations of the intact soil cores were monitored over time to determine the rate of P removal.
Batch experiments were conducted to determine maximum P retention capacity of the soils.
Soil samples were analyzed for inorganic P pool sizes, and selected properties.
During a 21 d hydraulic retention time, the constructed wetlands (sandy, low organic matter soils) retained 52 to 66% of added P, as compared with 46 to 47% retained by the natural wetlands (high organic matter soils).
The P retention as estimated using the Langmuir model, ranged from 196 to 1821 mg P kg(-1) (aerobic incubations) and from 32 to 1415 mg P kg(-1) (anaerobic incubations).
The P sorption maximum for the soils could be by batch equilibration with a single high P solution.
Anaerobic conditions increased P solubility.
Organic P pools and the Fe-Al-bound fraction seemed to control P chemistry in these natural and wetlands.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the processes responsible for Fe and Mn retention in peat and the effects of microbial activity, pH temperature, and metal concentration in AMD on these processes.
Experimental units consisted in 30 g (wet wt.) of fresh Sphagnum peat, which was repeatedly flushed with synthetic AMD at pH 3.5.
Of the four major processes of metal cation retention in peat (cation exchange, complexation with peat organic precipitation as oxides, and precipitation as sulfides), Fe oxidation and Fe binding on peat organics were predominant, with Fe oxides and organically bound Fe making up, respectively, 62 and 22% of the total Fe in the peat at the end of the experiment.
Whereas Fe complexation was a finite process, reaching saturation at 12 mg Fe g-1 dry peat, Fe-oxide concentration in peat increased steadily throughout the experiment.
At pH 3.5, Fe-oxide precipitation was depressed by the addition of an antiseptic (formaldehyde) to AMD, suggesting that the process was microbially mediated.
Iron oxide precipitation was higher at pH 5.5 than 3.5 and less depressed at pH 5.5 than 3.5 by the presence of formaldehyde in AMD.
The efficiency of peat to remove Fe from AMD was diminished at low temperature (
Manganese retention in peat was small compared with that of Fe, and Mn was retained in peat almost exclusively as exchangeable Mn2+.
Retention of Fe2+ in peat was not affected by the presence of Mn2+ in AMD.
Iron oxides that had accumulated in peat subjected to AMD were not readily resolubilized by any of three processes investigated: photoreduction, microbial FE(III) reduction under reducing conditions, and exposure to simulated acid precipitation.
These findings suggest that constructed wetlands may be an appropriate technology to remove Fe from AMD with low soluble Fe concentration, but are inadequate for treating drainage waters rich in soluble Mn. NAL Call No.: QH540.J6 *******************************************************

Descriptors: phragmites-australis; wetlands-; waste-water-treatment; waste-water; sewage-effluent; beijing-; artificial-wetlands; constructed-wetlands Abstract: The reed-bed system is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method of treating sewage from small treatment works.
A pilot-scale plant, which treated 500 m3/d of municipal and industrial wastewater, was studied in Beijing, China.
The aim of the project was (i) to test the ability of the reed beds to remove pollutants for long-term operation in cold weather conditions, and (ii) to evaluate its environmental, ecological and financial values.
The results of operation demonstrated that this system has the ability to remove the pollutants.
One of the attractive features is that the reed beds can partly convert the pollutants into plant biomass with the natural energy from sunlight.
The reeds can (a) be harvested each year, (b) provide a wildlife habitat, and (c) improve the quality of the ecosystem.
Capital and operating costs of the system are comparatively low.

Descriptors: wetlands-; riparian-vegetation; water-quality; pollutants-; water-pollution; pollution-control Abstract: Because of wet soils adjacent to the streams, riparian buffers are frequently present between farming and urban activities on the uplands and small streams.
These riparian areas have been shown to be very valuable for the removal of nonpoint-source pollution from drainage water.
Several researchers have measured 
The riparian buffers are less effective for P removal but may retain 50% of the surface-water P entering them.
I consider riparian buffers to be the most important factor influencing nonpoint-source pollutants entering surface water in many areas of the USA and the most important wetlands for surface water quality protection.

Descriptors: wetlands-; design-; waste-water-treatment; biochemical-oxygen-demand; hydraulics-; subsurface-drainage; artificial-wetlands; subsurface-flow Abstract: A modified procedure for minimizing excavation and media costs for subsurface constructed wetland design for BOD5 removal is presented.
Based upon the assumptions of first order BOD5 removal kinetics, a plug-flow reactor, and hydraulics governed by Darcy's law for a constructed wetland, this procedure incorporates the currently available theory into a unique systematic design approach.
The modified procedure suggests that a small slope and a small aspect ratio (length/width) should be used whenever possible.
This design procedure provides an optimization rationale for each design step and relates the primary design parameters to excavation and media material costs.
Operational parameters that determine the performance of constructed wetlands are more clearly defined than before based on the theoretical treatment presented.
Using this design procedure, cost reductions are demonstrated for two examples.
