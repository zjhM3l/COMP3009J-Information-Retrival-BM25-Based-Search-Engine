The respiratory oxygen consumption of roots and rhizomes almost perfectly balanced the oxygen influx through the columns leaving only 0.02 grams of oxygen per day to be released to the surrounding soil.
Therefore, the macrophyte-induced rhizosphere oxygenation was of no quantitative importance for aerobic biochemical oxygen demand degradation and microbial degradation.

The system has been effective in removing 80% of total suspended solids and 40-50% effective in removing biochemical oxygen demand.
The hyacinths are harvested to help facilitate the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the system.

Abstract: A modified procedure for minimizing excavation and media costs for subsurface constructed wetland design for BOD5 removal is presented.
Based upon the assumptions of first order BOD5 removal kinetics, a plug-flow reactor, and hydraulics governed by Darcy's law for a constructed wetland, this procedure incorporates the currently available theory into a unique systematic design approach.
The modified procedure suggests that a small slope and a small aspect ratio (length/width) should be used whenever possible.
This design procedure provides an optimization rationale for each design step and relates the primary design parameters to excavation and media material costs.
Operational parameters that determine the performance of constructed wetlands are more clearly defined than before based on the theoretical treatment presented.
Using this design procedure, cost reductions are demonstrated for two examples.

Abstract: Wetlands function as buffers for nutrients loaded from terrestrial ecosystems through drainage and surface discharges.
The objectives of our study were to (i) determine the P retention capacity of representative wetlands soils being used for disposal of treated wastewater and (ii) relate P retention characteristics to selected physicochemical properties to evaluate likely of P removal in the soils.
Intact soil cores (0-40 cm) and bulk soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected from a system of natural and constructed wetlands currently being used for disposal of treated wastewater.
Floodwater P concentrations of the intact soil cores were monitored over time to determine the rate of P removal.
Batch experiments were conducted to determine maximum P retention capacity of the soils.
Soil samples were analyzed for inorganic P pool sizes, and selected properties.
During a 21 d hydraulic retention time, the constructed wetlands (sandy, low organic matter soils) retained 52 to 66% of added P, as compared with 46 to 47% retained by the natural wetlands (high organic matter soils).
The P retention as estimated using the Langmuir model, ranged from 196 to 1821 mg P kg(-1) (aerobic incubations) and from 32 to 1415 mg P kg(-1) (anaerobic incubations).
The P sorption maximum for the soils could be by batch equilibration with a single high P solution.
Anaerobic conditions increased P solubility.
Organic P pools and the Fe-Al-bound fraction seemed to control P chemistry in these natural and wetlands.

1) DOCUMENT DELIVERY SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS The National Agricultural Library (NAL) supplies agricultural materials not found elsewhere to other libraries.

Therefore, NAL is viewed as a library of last resort.
SUBMIT REQUESTS FIRST TO LOCAL OR STATE LIBRARY SOURCES PRIOR TO SENDING TO NAL.
In the United States, possible sources are public libraries, land-grant university or other large research libraries within a state.
