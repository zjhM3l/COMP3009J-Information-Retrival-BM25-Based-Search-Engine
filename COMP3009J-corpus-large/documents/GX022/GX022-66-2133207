Why Protect the Habitat of Migratory Birds in Mexico?
The Challenge.
The biological diversity of species, or "biodiversity," is being lost at an unprecedented rate, with an estimated 1,000 species per year becoming extinct.
Maintaining biodiversity is necessary to conserve critical ecosystems and promote economic sustainability.
Many developing countries have ecosystems with a trove of biological resources and still-undiscovered plant and animal species.
Developing countries often deemed poor by traditional economic measures are frequently rich in "biological capital," where many new health-promoting and life-sustaining pharmaceutical drugs have been discovered.
In the United States, 25 percent of prescribed drugs include chemical compounds derived from wild species.
Wild species are the gene bank used to maintain the vigor of our crops and livestock.
The net economic benefits of biodiversity are estimated to be at least $3 trillion per year, or 11 percent of the annual world economic output.

USAID pioneered and now supports one of the most comprehensive biodiversity conservation programs of any bilateral donor.
The Agency has contributed to safeguarding biological diversity by its efforts to (1) improve the management of biologically significant areas, (2) promote the sustainable use of biological resources, and (3) support the conservation of genetic diversity.
USAID works closely with local communities and governments to help them change policies, institutions, incentives, and other factors to give people using the land the authority and incentive to manage their own resources sustainably, and to enable host country nongovernmental organizations and government agencies to provide conservation-related services.
Small farmers and other resource users will abandon destructive practices only if they have economically and culturally acceptable alternatives.
Success Stories.
USAID has supported sustainable natural resources management and biodiversity conservation in more than 60 countries over the last nine years.
Following are success stories from Ecuador, Russia, and Madagascar.
In Ecuador, USAID-supported policy dialog led to the 1997 enactment of the Galapagos Special Law.
After years of conflict among stakeholder groups, USAID sponsored a conflict resolution process in 1997 that facilitated development of a consensus among the three major groups with interest in the legislation: conservation, fisheries, and tourism.
The law enforces a quarantine system to protect the Galapagos' environment from species introduced from the continent.
It restricts immigration and empowers local institutions to take leadership in the affairs of the archipelago.
Under the law, commercial fishing is prohibited within 40 miles of most parts of the islands, and park fees from tourism stay in the Galapagos to self-finance their programs.
In Russia, USAID is working to protect the biodiversity of Lake Baikal, which includes 1,400 recorded species of higher plants and 1,500 aquatic species, 80 percent of which are found nowhere else on Earth.
Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world and contains some 20 percent of the world's freshwater supply.
USAID efforts emphasize coordinating land use, building stronger institutions, and promoting better land-water stewardship.
The Agency also collaborated with other donors and nongovernmental organizations in Russia to develop and implement programs that stabilized the endangered Siberian Tiger population at about 400 animals.
In Madagascar, USAID is working with the government to conserve the biodiversity of the nation, recognized as among the world's five richest environmental sites.
Although it occupies less than 2 percent of Africa's total land area, the island nation is home to a quarter of all African plants, and 80 percent of its flora and fauna are found nowhere else on Earth.
USAID programs in FY 2000 aim to increase the area in protected status by about 700,000 hectares, to 1.75 million hectares, or 10 percent of all forests in Madagascar, to protect representative samples of all the country's ecosystem types.
