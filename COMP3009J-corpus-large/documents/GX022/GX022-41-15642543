the humanitarian relief organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders)
today on winning the Nobel Peace Prize.
The Paris-based charity supports more than 2,000 medical professionals volunteering in 80 countries.
Medecins Sans Frontieres has a tradition of serving the victims of oppression while acknowledging with open eyes that much of the world's suffering is the result of the policies totalitarian governments pursue to the detriment of their own people
," Chairman Cox said.
The Nobel Prize Committee noted in its award that "
By intervening rapidly, Doctors Without Borders calls public attention to humanitarian catastrophes, and by pointing to the causes of such catastrophes, the organization helps to form bodies of public opinion opposed to violations and abuses of power."
In September 1998, Doctors Without Borders withdrew its physicians from North Korea because their humanitarian assistance was being abused by Communist Party officials of the Stalinist regime.
Among other violations of humanitarian concern, the North Korean government demanded that the group's doctors perform surgical operations on patients before they were diagnosed by medical experts.
In at least one instance, surgeons were told to remove a kidney from a North Korean by a local Communist party official without examining the patient's symptoms.
The Nobel Prize-winning organization refused to do so.
The Nobel Committee also considered awarding the Peace Prize to Chinese advocates of democracy Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan.
On news that the two might receive the Nobel Peace Prize, the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China arrested members of their families living in China.
The Associated Press reported that police forced their way into the home of Wang Dan's parents and detained Wang's mother.
Internal security forces were reported to have arrested Wei Jingsheng's brother.
Official PRC spokesmen condemned the Nobel Committee for "flagrant interference in China's internal affairs" when the international committee sought to honor the two Chinese citizens.
Wei and Wang are now in exile in the United States.
"These Chinese patriots understand their nation's future lies with greater democracy, not greater tyranny," Chairman Cox said.
"By considering them for this honor, the Nobel Committee served the cause of human freedom."
