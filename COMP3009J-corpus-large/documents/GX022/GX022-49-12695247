Leahy Given Top Honor By National Guard Association
(remarks follow)
BILOXI, Miss.
(Tues., Sept. 16) Sen. Patrick Leahy, co-chair of the United States Senate National Guard Caucus, received the National Guard Associations highest individual honor Tuesday during a ceremony at the National Guard Associations General Conference and Exhibition in Biloxi, Miss.
Leahy delivered remarks to more than 3,000 National Guard officers from across the country, including Vermont National Guard Adjutant General Martha Rainville, during the presentation to Leahy of the Harry S. Truman Award.
The National Guard Association, founded more than a century ago to ensure the National Guard was represented in Congress and to ensure the Guard has the resources it needs to defend the nation, awards the Truman Award annually to an individual who has made sustained contributions of exceptional and far-reaching magnitude to the defense and security of the United States in a manner worthy of recognition at the national level.
Former recipients of the award include President Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and the late Bob Hope.
Leahy has long championed National Guard initiatives in Congress.
Currently, he and others in the Senate are working to ensure that members of the National Guard and their families have access to adequate healthcare coverage.
Leahy led in producing, with a bipartisan coalition, a bill to make members of the National Guard, Reserves and their families eligible for the militarys health insurance program, TRICARE.
The bill was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate this summer, and Leahy is currently working to include both authorization and funding for the program in President Bushs requested $87 billion war supplemental bill.

Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy
Acceptance Of The Truman Award
National Meeting
National Guard Association of the United States
Biloxi, Mississippi
September 16, 2003
Thank you General Alexander, General Blum, and General Rainville.
General Rainville has been one of the finest leaders the Vermont National Guard has ever had.
She has a strong vision for the Green Mountain Boys and a practical desire to ensure that this proud Vermont unit steeped in history and accomplishment keeps its eyes on the challenges of today and of the future.
It is good to be with you today.
I am deeply honored to receive this award.
I am especially humbled, not only to be placed in the company of former presidents and senior congressional leaders, but more importantly because I feel it is an honor itself to be able to work for one of the countrys most essential and enduring institutions, the National Guard.
I became one of the co-chairs of U.S. Senates National Guard Caucus in early 2001.
This informal group brings together 83 members of the U.S. Senate to promote Guard priorities.
I work closely with my friend and fellow co-chair, Senator Kit Bond of Missouri.
Senator Bond and I talk frequently with General Alexander and his staff with the National Guard Association, and he and all of you have helped us to make sure the Caucus continues to be one of the most active, effective and important informal groups in the Senate.
If Senator Bond and I were to write a motto for the Caucuss work on behalf of the National Guard, our motto might be this: Never Let Your Guard Down.
We work to make sure that the entire Senate values the Guard, and we work to make sure the Guard is adequately prepared and that the needs of Guardsmen and their families are met.
We are living through watershed moments for the country and for the National Guard.
In the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, the Congress and the American people have come to more fully understand and appreciate the critical role of the National Guard to our national security.
The value and the commitment and the heroism of those who serve in the Guard have never been more apparent to the nation and to the world than they are today.
At a time of increased foreign contingencies, rising budget deficits, and the continual threat of terrorism, America needs the 500,000 citizen-soldiers and airmen of the National Guard as never before.
Every single contingency that the United States has been involved in has underscored that the nation simply cannot go to war or keep the peace without the National Guard and Reserves.
When I say that, I am including the Balkans, Haiti and other interventions well before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that came after September 11^th.
Just last week I received an e-mail from Lt. Col. Terry Lambert of the Green Mountain Boys of Vermont.
Col. Lambert was deployed to Kabul, Afghanistan, where he will serve for almost four months, as the deputy commander to the Afghan National Army Training Assistance Group.
Terry described to me all the groundbreaking work the assistance group is accomplishing, such as establishing the first-ever Training Assistance Group by a National Guard unit; setting out the weapons and fitness standards for the Afghan National Army; and completing a comprehensive assessment of this new army.
I am so proud of what they and every member of our armed forces are doing there.
And I know this outstanding contribution mirrors the achievements of our citizen-soldiers deployed in Iraq.
We in the Senate are especially mindful these days of the Guards critical role in homeland security.
For months the Capitol Dome and our office windows rumbled with the sound of independence, security and freedom as Air National Guard F-16s flew CAPS overhead.
The Air Guard flew thousands of sorties at part of Operation Noble Eagle, while the Army Guard provided a crucial ramping up of security at our nations airports and other vulnerable facilities.
But if we are going to take full advantage of the Guards skills, energy and talents, the Guard Caucus recognizes that our decision-makers need to employ the Guard more smartly.
A smarter use of the Guard means three major things: First, dedicating more resources and equipment to the force; second, strengthening personnel benefits to improve readiness; and third, ensuring that the National Guard remains firmly under state control during homeland security incidents.
MODERNIZING THE GUARD
Continual call-ups and use of the National Guard for emergencies at home and abroad have placed a strain on the Guards aging weapons systems.
Today there is an equipment backlog exceeding $1 billion.
Senator Bond and I have worked closely with the Appropriations Committee to help significantly increase annual appropriations for the Guard and Reserve Equipment Account, which allows the Guard Bureau to steer funds to critical priorities.
Money from this account has made the National Guards inventory of F-16s some of the most capable in the Air Force.
But more must be done, and the active forces must continue to commit some of the most advanced equipment to the Guard.
And if the Guard is going to continue to play such a critical role, it needs the flexibility to its job.
When deployments are micromanaged from Washington, when Guard units are told to send specific people, rather than giving wider units a mission, that kind of micromanagement can diminish morale and fighting effectiveness.
STRENGTHENING THE GUARDS READINESS
But most importantly, the nation needs to allow the Guard to support its people in ways that bolster the Guards critical national security role.
Along with Senators DeWine of Ohio, Senator Daschle of South Dakota, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and others, I am currently sponsoring S. 852, which will guarantee affordable health insurance to every member of the Selected Reserve, including the National Guard.
If our bipartisan legislation is enacted, any member of the Selected Reserve will gain access to the TRICARE program on a cost-share basis, paying an annual premium that is comparable to what federal employees pay.
General Blum has properly recognized that this is a military readiness issue.
He points out that when our citizen soldiers and airmen are healthy, the entire National Guard and the entire military are more ready to fight.
Right now our coalition is working to convince the President and our colleagues in Congress that our legislation deserves to be included in the Supplemental Appropriations Bill that the Congress will consider in the next few weeks.
PRESERVING THE GUARDS LOCAL VECTOR
Using the Guard more intelligently also means ensuring local control of the force in homeland defense situations.
The Guard needs to serve under a so-called Title 32 capacity that allows units to continue to serve under the state command structure.
This approach takes advantage of the Guards superb relationships with first-responders and public safety organizations, and this structure maintains state sovereignty in even the direst emergencies.
I am pleased to report that our Senate National Guard Caucus will soon introduce legislation that encourages the establishment of state joint headquarters and call-ups under Title 32, if additional attacks occur.
Above all, we cannot abuse the Guard on foreign deployments.
In an international landscape dominated by ethnic conflict, failed state, terrorism, and the countrys superpower status, the nations military strategies will tend to gravitate toward long-term military occupations.
The Guard must carry some of the burden that will fall at first toward the active military, but the bulk of the force should not get bogged down anywhere, which would erode the Guards ability to support the state and homeland defense missions, as well as other military contingencies.
As the co-chair of the National Guard Caucus, I pledge to you that I will continue to work with Senator Bond and the entire U.S. Senate to ensure the National Guard continues to remain a critical part of our nations defense.
Together we are making progress that few thought possible, so soon, in helping the Guard to adapt and grow into its changing role.
This fall, I hope that our successes will also include winning for Guardsmen and their families the first-tier health insurance that they need, and that the country needs them to have.
Its good to be with you, and its good to be a partner with you in this mission to strengthen and honor the Guard.
Thank you.
