BRAZIL
Summary of Assistance
USAID is providing the Department with funds to support the second meeting of the BigLeaf Mahogany Working Group in Belem, Brazil.
The group will address scientific risk assessment issues concerning Mahogany.
Specifically, the group will address the technical foundation for the mandatory "scientific non-detriment finding" for internationally traded mahogany, a novel and centrally important ecological risk assessment methods issue.
Funds provided will contribute to bringing together stakeholders from the scientific and management communities in range states (Latin America) and importing nations to: (1) share information on criteria and process for making the scientific non-detriment finding; (2) harmonize international risk assessment approaches; and (3) facilitate the process for certification of ecologically sustainable mahogany shipments.
Funding
$10,000 from USAID in FY 03.
Results to Date
None.
Significant Problems or Delays
None.
Major Activities Planned for Next Reporting Period
DOI will transfer the funds to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Additional Information
Reports describing the results of this initiative will be available upon request.
CAMBODIA
Summary of Assistance
Cambodia is surrounded by several countries that, having hunted their own wildlife to extinction, have turned to Cambodia as a source of skins, bones, internal organs, and other wildlife products.
The wildlife crimes perpetrated or abetted by traffickers in these countries have been well documented.
Decisive and urgent action is necessary to protect Cambodia's remaining wildlife in the country's long-term economic, social, and environmental interests.
Tough enforcement measures alone may not be feasible due to lack of infrastructure and manpower and may even backfire.
Commercial dealers and professional hunters are often responsible for encouraging poor villagers to poach.
Currently, law enforcement officials find it difficult to reach the instigators and often end up arresting villagers who hunt for subsistence.
Development assistance can provide villagers with economic alternatives, but it will not discourage opportunistic poaching.
A combination of law enforcement and community participation is therefore required.
DOI is working in collaboration with Conservation International (CI) and WildAid to provide training for park rangers and protected area managers to help standardize law enforcement training and form a cadre of managerial-level trainers to train future rangers beyond the life of project.
DOI is also supporting law enforcement in the Cardamoms and in Bokor.
These sites will serve as model protected areas in a country with no lasting examples of effective wildlife conservation, and as the basis for transferring technical and management skills to other protected areas.
Funding
$50,000 from EAPEI in FY '02
Results to Date
A DOI expert participated in a review team to assess the current state of data and information on the status and condition of Cambodia's forest resources.
The DOI expert helped develop guidance and methods for the assessment of the current distribution, status, and value of Cambodia's forests and forest lands (July 2003).
Significant Problems or Delays
None.
Major Activities Planned for Next Reporting Period
DOI will pursue requested technical assistance to the CITES Secretariat in Cambodia.
Additional Information
Reports describing the results of DOI technical assistance in Cambodia will be available upon request.
CENTRAL AMERICA--Mundo Maya
Summary of Assistance
The Mundo Maya (i.e., "Mayan World") region, which encompasses approximately 500,000 square kilometers in Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and southern Mexico, connects the countries and regions that share a common Mayan heritage.
This area, containing magnificent archaeological sites and large swaths of intact tropical forests, is facing development pressures from the more than five million Mayan descendants and others who currently reside there.
Other ecological and cultural pressures include poaching of both archaeological artifacts and natural resources, and the growing numbers of tourists.
In 1993, the Tourism Ministries of each of these five countries created the Mundo Maya Organization (MMO) in an effort to develop a coordinated regional strategy to promote sustainable tourism at the Mayan archaeological sites.
The goal of the MMO, using both internal and external funding (e.g., from the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB)), is to contribute to the sustainable economic and social development of the Mayan region through the establishment of regional circuits that offer cultural, ecological and adventure tourism.
DOI has signed a 5-year Memorandum of Understanding with the MMO to provide technical assistance and training to any of the MMO countries.
DOI has provided technical assistance to 12 selected Mayan sites in the areas of: protection and maintenance of the natural and cultural resources; visitor infrastructure, services, and education; capacity-building; and community participation.
The DOI staff is working closely with in-country archaeologists, park managers, engineers, economists, and the local communities.
Starting with FY `03, the MMO and IDB will request technical assistance from DOI on a project-by-project basis.
Funding
$6,000 from InterAmerican Development Bank in FY `03
$70,000 from the InterAmerican Development Bank in FY `02

ECUADOR--Galapagos Islands
Summary of Assistance
Galapagos National Park includes one of the largest marine reserves in the world, covering approximately 133,000 square kilometers.
As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Galapagos National Park is recognized internationally as one of the most ecologically important and unique aquatic ecosystems in the world.
Conservation of Galapagos National Park remains a major challenge.
Conflicts in recent years between fishermen and local conservation authorities have led to fierce rhetoric and violent action, and pressures from powerful stakeholder groups can dominate decision-making at the expense of conservation and responsible resource management.
Endangered species such as sea cucumber and lobster are being exploited to the point of local extinction, and the national government and Galapagos Park authorities are hard-pressed to enforce regulations with limited budgets and capabilities.
There are also circumstances of trafficking between the islands and other countries in chemical precursors for drug production.
At the same time, this is an economically strategic part of the country, providing a large share of Ecuador's tourism income.
DOI has signed an Interagency Agreement with USAID/Ecuador to provide, on behalf of USAID/Ecuador, technical support for enforcement activities.
Under this agreement, DOI is tasked with purchasing specialized equipment to be used in enforcement and monitoring activities in the Galapagos Islands.
Funding
$2,000,000 from USAID/Ecuador in FY `02
Results to Date
Assessment and Planning
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Procurement Plan: DOI completed a procurement plan which was approved by USAID/Ecuador (Dec 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Needs Assessment: DOI provided a law enforcement special agent to assess law enforcement equipment needs in the Galapagos and to draft a plan of action for acquiring the equipment and training protected area staff on the use and maintenance of this equipment (April/May 2002).
Equipment Procurement
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Seawolf amphibious plane: After extensive research, DOI determined that the Seawolf is the ideal plane for Galapagos law enforcement.
The Seawolf is the only single engine, boat hulled, amphibious aircraft in the world that is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Unlike any other light aircraft, the Seawolf is especially constructed to be used in the saltwater environment.
A contract was awarded in January 2003 to Lake Aircraft to custom-build this plane for Galapagos National Park.
The plane construction is completed.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Retrofitting the Guadalupe River: The Guadalupe River is a 100-foot aluminum vessel used by the Galapagos Marine Reserve to conduct short and long term law enforcement patrols, ferry employees and supplies among the many islands of the archipelago and conduct scientific research.
This is a crucial piece of equipment to the Galapagos Marine Reserve and its safe and efficient operation is paramount to successful operations there.
DOI awarded a contract to Seacraft Shipyard Corporation to repair and retrofit the Guadalupe River in March 2003.
The retrofitting is completed and the Guadelupe River has returned to the Galapagos.
Field Equipment: DOI has procured six complete sets of camping equipment to enable Park Guards to set up temporary base camps for remote surveillance of protected areas.
The equipment was shipped to the Park aboard the Guadelupe River.
Two aluminum boats were purchased for the Park and were shipped to the Park aboard the Guadelupe River.
Significant Problems or Delays
None.
Major Activities Planned for Next Reporting Period
A Galapagos National Park pilot and mechanic will be trained in the specific use and maintenance of the Seawolf.
DOI will deliver the plane to the Galapagos in December 2003.
Additional Information

GEORGIA
Summary of Assistance
DOI has established a long-term working relationship with the Republic of Georgia to foster a national system of protected areas in Georgia.
The working relationship was formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which created a general technical assistance program and a specific sister park relationship.
With funding from USAID/Georgia, DOI has been working to develop Lagodekhi Nature Reserve as a pilot protected area that can serve as a model for conservation, education and interpretation, law enforcement, and search and rescue activities for Georgia's protected area system.
Lagodekhi Nature Reserve is an area of high biodiversity -- combining both relic and endemic plants with rare animal species.
The Reserve has significant tourism potential given its natural beauty and proximity to Tbilisi, the nation's capital.
Lagodekhi is considered to be the Yellowstone of Georgia, having been established in 1912 as the first Reserve in the country.
The establishment of Lagodekhi signaled the recognition that certain areas of the country should be set aside for preservation.
Village residents observed and supported the founding of the Reserve.
Today's economic climate, though difficult, has not changed the overall support the Reserve enjoys.
Views from around the Reserve vividly illustrate the conditions that might prevail if the Reserve were not protected.
Overgrazing and logging, to say nothing of subsistence hunting, would soon consume the small Reserve's resources.
DOI is providing technical assistance on the development of visitor services within the Reserve, including a nature trail and entrance facilities.
DOI is also providing technical assistance on law enforcement, to help Lagodekhi staff protect the Reserve's wildlife from poaching.
A new source of funding from the World Bank Global Environmental Facility ($9.0 million) assists the development of five protected areas in the Republic of Georgia: Lagodekhi Nature Reserve, Vashlovani Proposed National Park and Nature Reserve, David Garegi Proposed Protected Area, Tusheti Proposed National Park and Protected Landscape, and Kolkheti National Park.
DOI is currently working with the Global Environmental Facility to develop a plan of technical assistance to support its Protected Areas Development Project.
Funding
$50,000 from USAID/Georgia in FY `00
$200,000 from USAID/Europe and Eurasia Bureau in FY `99

GUATEMALA
Summary of Assistance
The 1.5 million hectare Mayan Biosphere Reserve, located in the northern Department (i.e., state) of El Peten, forms the core of the largest tract of intact tropical forests remaining in Meso-America.
This area is one of the most important regions in the world in terms of biological diversity.
DOI is working closely with the Guatemalan protected area management agency, Consejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas (CONAP), to strengthen protected area management in the Mayan Biosphere Reserve.
DOI technical assistance in the Reserve is designed to promote and enhance coordination among managing entities within the Reserve and enhance coordination, interaction, and cooperation between U.S. and Guatemalan protected area staff.
It is intended that this program of technical assistance in the Mayan Biosphere Reserve will help CONAP develop model strategies that may be extended throughout Guatemala's protected area system.
DOI technical assistance is also planned for other key bio-regions in FY `03: The Volcanoes of AtitlÃ¯Â¿Â½n, located in the western highlands, and the PolochÃ¯Â¿Â½c-Motagua wildlife area, in the eastern lowlands, and the Chisec area in northern Alta Verapaz.
The potential for partnerships with local municipalities and the private sector will be explored in these new areas, in addition to assisting the local communities in providing visitor services.

Fire Management
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fire Fighting in Macaw Nesting Area: At the request of USAID/Guatemala, DOI contracted, on an emergency basis, a local non-governmental organization, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), to hire and combat extensive wildfires that threatened a sensitive scarlet macaw nesting area, located within the Laguna del Tigre National Park.
WCS has been monitoring the reproductive success of the macaws in this area (comprising 80% of the macaw nests known in Guatemala) as a key indicator of the ecological integrity of this protected area.
As a result, WCS successfully prevented the fires from destroying this area, despite the long and damaging fire season experienced throughout Guatemala this year (June 2003).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fire Prevention Planning and Educational Materials: Six key mid- to upper-level Guatemalan managers that have a role in fire management for the entire country worked with two DOI fire management staff on developing Guatemala's first fire prevention and education materials to initiate a nationwide fire prevention campaign (June 2001).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Basic Fire Fighting Training: Thirty Guatemalan Mayan Biosphere Reserve fire fighters were trained by DOI fire management experts on the basics of fire suppression and control, and health and safety (Mar 2001).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fire Fighting Organization and Emergency Response Training: Fifteen mid-level Guatemalan managers that have a role in fire management within the Mayan Biosphere Reserve were trained on the Incident Command System (ICS).
ICS is the system used by the U.S. to properly organize and allocate resources to maximize fire fighting effectiveness and efficiency (Mar 2001).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fire Management Study Tour to U.S.: A Fire Management Study Tour was conducted at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho.
The 16 Guatemalan government officials participating in the study tour learned about U.S. approaches to fire management, including organizational, technical, budgetary, educational, and restoration issues (Oct 2000).

Planning and Design
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Follow-up Design Revisions and Finalization: DOI provided on-site assistance to finalize construction designs for park staff housing and ranger stations at the Sierra del Lancandon National Park.
DOI expertise was particularly significant in designing low-tech systems for potable water, wastewater management, solid waste disposal, and energy needs in these remote locations, using locally-available materials.
The park is currently in the process of constructing and/or rehabilitating the structures designed and specified by the DOI and Guatemalan team (May 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Design of Park Ranger Station and Park Staff Housing: A DOI architect and a DOI engineer worked with Guatemalan architects to plan for and draw designs and specifications for park staff housing and ranger stations at Sierra del Lancandon National Park.
The DOI staff continued assisting their Guatemalan counterparts after the trip, providing much technical information, calculations, and further revisions to drawings and specifications (May 2001).
General Park Management
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cave Management: A DOI cave expert provided technical assistance for low-impact and community-based management of a series of caverns in Guatemala's Alta Verapaz region.
DOI provided specific recommendations on how tourists should be managed through each cave, interpretation strategies, and health and safety issues.
Immediate results include the trail improvement that the community undertook during this trip following DOI's exact specifications.
This DOI visit coincided with Guatemala's "First International Symposium on Cave Tourism," where experts were brought in from Italy, Costa Rica, and the U.S. to work with Guatemala's growing geology and cave experts.
At the Guatemalan government's request, the DOI cave expert made a presentation on DOI's "Leave No Trace" program (July 2003).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Critical Habitat Assessment: A DOI resource manager provided technical assistance to the Punta de Manabique National Park, a marine park along the Gulf Coast of Guatemala.
DOI collaborated with a local non-governmental organization, Fundaparque, successfully mapping key areas of the park that composes critical habitat for the Saltwater Crocodile, an endangered species with very limited range worldwide.
DOI also provided Fundaparque recommendations on activities that would improve the survival of this species through the protection of this vulnerable habitat (August 2003).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Park Management Study Tour to U.S.: Nine high- and mid-level Guatemalan park officials completed a study tour of four DOI sites within the U.S.
As a result of this study tour, the Mayan Biosphere Reserve is currently in the process of establishing a sister park relationship with Big Cypress National Park (Sept 2001).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Evaluation of Laguna del Tigre Park Status: DOI assisted a team of USAID/Guatemala staff in assessing whether USAID/Guatemala should continue funding the management of the Laguna del Tigre National Park and, if so, how to do so most effectively.
The team recommended that assistance to the park continue, and USAID/Guatemala has continued to provide assistance to the new team of park staff (June 2001).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Long-term Park Management Training to Guatemalan Park Officials: Two CONAP (Guatemalan Park Service) officials from the Mayan Biosphere Reserve completed a 2-month training program for protected area managers entitled Wildland Management in the Tropics.
The training was held in Costa Rica and focused on hands-on, practical field training (June 2001).
Policy
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Policy Advice to Guatemala's New Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources: DOI helped the Government of Guatemala map out the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies that deal with the environment and natural resources in Guatemala, including the newly established Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (Mar 2001).
Significant Problems or Delays
No other major activities occurred this reporting period, as USAID/Guatemala is in the process of assessing whether DOI should focus on funding and managing a sister park relationship between Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida and Laguna del Tigre in El PetÃ¯Â¿Â½n Department.
This decision should be made in FY `03, after which DOI will either move forward with the sister parks or apply its remaining funds to other activities.
Major Activities Planned for Next Reporting Period
DOI will provide technical assistance on the management of tourists in the Lake AtitlÃ¯Â¿Â½n region that will incorporate the local communities in November 2003.

INDONESIA--Coal Seam Fires
Summary of Assistance
The Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining is providing technical assistance to:
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Build the capacity of the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to respond quickly to coal seam fires -- particularly those that present a threat to human health and safety, the environment, other resources, and infrastructure; and
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Assist in establishing a long-term capability within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to respond to coal fires.
Funding
$462,500 from the East Asia and Pacific Environmental Initiative (EAPEI) in FY `99
$1,000,000 from EAPEI in FY `98
Results to Date
Fire Management
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Before the project started in October 1998, no real effort was being made to put out coal fires.
DOI has provided extensive training to help the Ministry put out the fires - 79 of which were in East Kalimantan.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fifty-six of the fires DOI has helped put out were in the Sungai Wain Nature Reserve area that is a release area for rehabilitated orangutans.
DOI taught appropriate personnel methods of suppression that would minimize disruption of the habitat.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Indonesian and Malaysian instructors provided direct input into the development of coal seam fire suppression training which would best meet local needs and reflect local conditions.
American, Malaysian, and Indonesian instructors jointly taught the courses (Feb 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The DOI Project Coordinator presented a paper describing the Coal Fire Suppression Project and its results at the ASEAN conference on fire and haze in Malaysia.
The Project Director has also advised Malaysian officials on the suppression of peat fires (June 2002).
Policy
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Coal Seam Fire Project contributed directly to establishing linkages between the regional Ministry offices (Kanwils) and the provincial and local governments that have helped identify and locate coal seam fires.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ DOI has helped the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources start and maintain an inventory of active coal fires.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Donor coordination has been promoted through consultations, including the Project Director's presentation of a paper on coal fires in Indonesia and DOI's project at the Second International Symposium on Operationalization of Remote Sensing in Enschede, Netherlands.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Public-private partnerships have been established between a number of East Kalimantan government agencies, Mulwarman University, the TROPENBOS-Kalimantan Research Project funded by the Netherlands, and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ A permanent source of funding has been identified for coal seam fire suppression from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Coal Royalty program.
The Ministry has included a request for Rp24 billion for coal fire suppression in its current budget request, and these funds will likely be obtained from the Royalty account.
The Ministry has recently approved additional funding for coal fire suppression.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The East Kalimantan Kanwil was the first to implement decentralized coal fire suppression.
The East Kalimantan experience serves as a useful model for the Ministry as it proceeds with its response to the national legislation that mandates the transfer of program responsibilities from Jakarta to regional and local arms of the Ministry and to regional and local government.
Text Box: Success Story DOI technical assistance directly prompted a Ministerial Decree on October 7, 1999 (Decree No. 1539 K/20/MPE/1999) that established policy regarding coal fire suppression for the Ministry.
The decree clarifies the Ministry's responsibility to extinguish coal fires, assigns the lead for implementing the program to Kanwil offices (regional offices of the Ministry), and authorizes use of the Coal Royalty Fund to support the activities.
Because of the new decree and the publicity the project has received locally, coal fires are now being reported in several other provinces and, most important, the Ministry is putting out fires without outside assistance.
Dissemination of Lessons Learned
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Project Director made a presentation on the coal fire project at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Denver, Colorado (Feb 2003).
Significant Problems or Delays
None.
The project is completed.
Major Activities Planned for Next Reporting Period
None.
The project is completed.

Results to Date
Long-Term Technical Assistance
Ã¯Â¿Â½ DOI has trained personnel from mining and environmental offices in East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, Riau, West Sumatra, South Sumatra and Bengkulu on steps required for them to assume the Ministry's natural resource management programs in response to national legislation that mandates the transfer of program responsibilities from Jakarta to regional and local governments.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Project Coordinator has provided direct assistance to the Ministry's Agency for Education and Training Staff (Badiklat) in practices and procedures for developing a strategic plan.
Particular attention was paid to implementation schedules and methods for evaluating program accomplishments, and obtaining customer feedback.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Project Coordinator provided technical assistance on questionnaire design and survey research to the Badiklat staff.
He helped design survey instruments that will be used to develop the training that the Ministry will deliver to local governments over the next 2-years.
DOI provided Training for Trainers, a course aimed at improving course development, organization and presentation skills of the training cadre in the Ministry (June 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Program Coordinator also provided assistance concerning certification efforts for technical personnel at mine sites (June 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Efforts are underway to develop a proposal for the Ministry that could lead to support from the World Bank for a technical skills certification process in Indonesia that would be managed under the auspices of one or more Ministries (June 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cooperation continues with the Ministry of Forestry on developing criteria for mines approved to operate in protected forests.
Protected forests do not have the same absolute prohibitions against mining as conservation forests and parks but access is expected to be limited because of their role in protecting watersheds and valuable habitats.
Draft criteria were completed in June 2003.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ New effluent standards for coal mining operations are being developed.
Discussions with a team from the Ministry of Environment (BAPEDAL) have included an explanation of the U.S. industry-specific standards and why those parameters and numbers were selected.
The U.S. standards were compared to Indonesian general industry standards and discussions about why some of them may not be appropriate for mining operations.
OSM participated on a small inter-ministry team including industry representatives to draft national effluent standards for coal mining operations.
A final draft Ministerial Decree on Effluent Discharge Standards for coal mines and processing facilities was submitted to the Minister of Environment for signature in June 2003 was approved in July 2003.
Short-Term Technical Assistance
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Maximum Economic Recovery--Mineral Production and Royalty Audits: Two DOI experts traveled to Indonesia to conduct meetings and make presentations on issues related to promoting maximum economic recovery of mineral resources.
A supervisory auditor in OSM's Abandoned Mine Land Fee Collection Division and a mining engineer in OSM's Appalachian Regional Coordinating Center provided training seminars in production estimation and royalty calculations for coal mines.
The seminars included field exercises in a recently mined-out pit in East Kalimantan where calculations of lost royalties were made to demonstrate the financial impacts of poor mining practices (Feb 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fine Coal Recovery: Two U.S. experts on fine coal recovery traveled to Indonesia to meet with government officials and companies to discuss plant improvements required for improved fine coal recovery.
They conducted seminars on fine coal recovery, preparation plant design and the economic and environmental benefits of enhanced coal recovery.
Using local data collected from local companies, they made presentations to local officials and company managers in Tenggarong, East Kalimantan and in Jakarta on how to recover fine coal and the costs to do it.
They were also able to calculate lost profits per company ($2-4 million/year) and $250-400,000 in royalties/year/company (April 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Small-Scale Gold Mining: The Chief of Colorado's Division of Geology and Minerals visited Indonesia to lead a half-day discussion with BAPEDALDA and Mining agency officials in N. Sulawesi on regulating small-scale gold miners and processors and the options to replace mercury amalgamation of gold with cyanide vat leach methods for gold extraction (Feb 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Revision of Mining Law: Two teams traveled to Indonesia to work on revisions to the mining law.
The officials were part of a Ministry team tasked with completing a full-scale revision and update of the Mining Law for submission to the parliament.
A controversial version was submitted to the parliament in late December 2001 and, technically, remains under consideration.
Given the length of time this draft has been sitting without active debate, it is likely to be rescinded and revised by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources then resubmitted.
No schedule has been proposed.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Advanced Inspector Training.
An OSM/State Regulatory Training Team traveled to Indonesia to assist in the presentation of Advanced Inspector Training to local government officials between September 26 and October 16, 2002.
U.S. Based Training
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mine Permitting and Inspection: Improving interagency cooperation is one of the project goals.
A mixture of Bapedal-da and Dinas Pertambangan staffs visited Colorado to learn how Colorado uses mine permitting and inspection to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts.
The participants first received detailed briefings on the important elements in the mine-specific permit then conducted field visits to those mines that produced construction materials, molybdenum, coal, and gold (Aug 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ U.S. Tour of Fine Coal Recovery Technologies: The Project Director accompanied a delegation of central, provincial and local government officials to the U.S. to observe modern fine coal recovery technology in action.
The delegation attended a one-day workshop on coal processing then toured three preparation plants in the area around Pittsburgh, PA, where they saw actual implementation of the recovery technologies.
Concerns raised by company officials regarding restrictions on the percentage of fine coal they can include in their shipments were addressed through discussions with coal buyers, company executives and plant designers (March 2002).
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Revision of Mining Law: Indonesian officials traveled to the U.S. for specific training on matters relating to the revision of Indonesia's 1967 Mining Law, decentralization, and environmental management under decentralized systems (May 2001).
Intern Training and Advanced Inspector Training
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Regional Inspector Training: Indonesian interns with their OSM and State Government mentors created training tailored for regional government mine inspectors.
This 2-week inspector training was given in July 2002.
The focus of the training was to ensure that participants:
