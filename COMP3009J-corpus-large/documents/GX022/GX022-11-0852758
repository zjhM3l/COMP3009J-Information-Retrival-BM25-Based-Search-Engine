Introduction
On May 23, 1972, Richard Nixon, President of the United States, and N. V. Podgorny, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Socialist Republics, signed an Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Protection between the United States of America and the USSR.
This agreement was to be implemented for the following areas: air pollution, water pollution, environmental pollution associated with agricultural production, enhancement of the urban environment, preservation of nature and the organization of preserves, marine pollution, biological and genetic consequences of environmental pollution, influence of environmental changes on climate, earthquake prediction, Arctic and sub-Arctic ecological systems, and legal and administrative measures for protecting environmental quality.
Working Group VIII (WG VIII), established to address the issue of influence of environmental changes on climate, now includes five projects: climate change; atmospheric composition; radiative fluxes, cloud climatology, and climate modeling; data exchange management; and stratospheric ozone.
The office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Interests of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been the coordinating agency for WG VIII projects in the U.S., and the Russian Federal Agency for Hydrometeorology has been the coordinating agency within the former USSR.
The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) has been active in the WG VIII project on data exchange since 1990.
CDIAC's participation in WG VIII activities has been facilitated by its participation in the Quantitative Links initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy's Global Change Research Program (DOE/GCRP).
CDIAC's role in this initiative has been to provide the quality-assured data sets needed to quantify the relationship between changes in atmospheric composition and changes in climate.
In support of this role, CDIAC has been collaborating with research institutions in the former USSR to identify, quality assure, document, and package selected data sets as CDIAC numeric data packages (NDPs).
In 1991, CDIAC published the NDP Atmospheric CO[2] Concentrations from Flask Samples Collected at U.S.S.R.-Operated Sampling Sites (ORNL/CDIAC-51, NDP-033), compiled by Thomas A. Boden of CDIAC, with data contributed by A. M. Brounstein, E. V. Faber, and A. A. Shashkov of the Main Geophysical Observatory (St. Petersburg, Russia).
In 1993, CDIAC published the NDPs Daily Temperature and Precipitation Data for 223 USSR Stations (ORNL/CDIAC-56, NDP-040) compiled by Russell S. Vose of CDIAC, and Six- and Three-Hourly Meteorological Observations from 223 U.S.S.R.
Stations (ORNL/CDIAC-66, NDP-048), compiled by Dale P. Kaiser of CDIAC; data for both were contributed by V. N. Razuvaev, E. G. Apasova, and R. A. Martuganov of the Research Institute of Hydrometeorological Information-World Data Center (Obnisk, Russia).
CDIAC has also hosted visits by Russian scientists, and CDIAC staff have visited Russian geophysical research institutions and data centers.
CDIAC sent a survey to 172 researchers in 11 countries asking them to suggest data sets that (1) would be of particular importance to the quantification of the links between changes in atmospheric chemistry, the Earth's radiative balance, and climate but (2) were of limited usefulness because of problems with availability, documentation, or quality, or (3) did not currently exist but could be compiled from separate extant data sets.
More than one hundred data sets were suggested, in areas ranging from climate and the cryosphere to the Earth's surface or cover and trace gas emissions and concentrations.
This and a follow-up survey indicated that researchers in this area are especially interested in the Earth's surface budget, clouds, aerosols, and general circulation models.
To respond to the interest in these four areas, CDIAC and the All-Russian Research Institute of Hydrometeorological Information-World Data Center (RIHMI-WDC) in Obninsk, Russia, began a collaborative project to produce a series of dual-language bibliographies of Russian literature that had not previously been translated into English.
As part of this work, CDIAC and RIHMI-WDC decided to evaluate new, computer-based translation and word-processing software.
The first report in the series Selected Translated Abstracts of Russian-Language Climate Change Publications, published in 1992, was Volume I. Surface Energy Budget (ORNL/CDIAC-57; Proceedings, RIHMI-WDC 158); the second report, published in 1994, was Volume II.
Clouds (ORNL/CDIAC-64; Proceedings, RIHMI-WDC 159).
They are available on request from CDIAC, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, P.O. Box 2008, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831-6335, U.S.A.; telephone: (865) 574-3645, fax: (865) 574-2232, e-mail: cdiac@ornl.gov.
CDIAC and RIHMI-WDC agreed that the remaining volumes in this series would be prepared in Obninsk and published in Oak Ridge.
For this purpose, CDIAC transferred to RIHMI-WDC the hardware and software that had been used in the preparation of the first two volumes.
The current report, about aerosols, is the third volume in the series; it has been prepared by RIHMI-WDC in collaboration with CDIAC.
A fourth volume, about general circulation models, is planned.
This report covers Russian literature that has not been translated into English.
The reader is also referred to the English-language journals Soviet Meteorology and Hydrology and Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics, which consist of translations of the Russian-language journals.

An equation system has been considered, which describes the turbulent transfer and oxidation of sulfurous gas in the atmosphere as well as the formation, flow rate, and transfer of sulfuric acid vapors, and is needed for source calculation of stratospheric aerosol sulphate.
Calculations of sulfurous gas and sulfuric acid vapors vertical profiles are given.
Expression for velocity of condensation growth of stratospheric aerosol particles at the expense of absorption of sulfuric acid and water vapor has been derived.
Quantitative estimates of characteristics at the time of condensation growth of aerosol particles in atmosphere by various quantities of relative air humidity are performed.
On the basis of derived relations, the formation regularity of the stratospheric aerosol layer by various formation intensities of primary aerosol particles are analyzed.

A stratospheric aerosol layer formation model is developed in which, along with input and oxidation processes of sulfurous gases, sulfuric acid and water vapor condensation on aerosol particles, coagulations, sedimentations and vertical aerosol turbulent transfer nucleation from sulfuric acid and water vapor and condensation nuclei tropospheric sink are considered.
Model calculations were compared with experimental data for the background stratospheric aerosol layer.
The comparison permitted us to determine the parameter values which characterize the speed of condensation growth and formation of aerosol particles in the stratosphere.

On the basis of a developed model, evolution regularities of the stratospheric aerosol layer are studied after aerosol particles of different sizes and sulfur dioxide are introduced into the stratosphere by an explosive-type volcanic eruption.
It is demonstrated that the input of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere and the formation of the fine-disperse aerosol fraction from eruption products are responsible for a significant climatic reaction of a stratospheric aerosol layer after a powerful volcanic eruption.

On the basis of a developed model of stratospheric aerosol layer formation, regularities of its evolution are studied after the input of aerosol particles into the stratosphere in a wide range of quantities of their initial concentrations including very large ones (by 10^1-10^5 fold exceeding of the background level concentrations).
It is demonstrated that when a considerable increase in aerosol concentration occurs in the stratosphere, the characteristic return time of mass and optical depth of the stratospheric aerosol layer to the background level substantially diminishes.

A physico-mathematical model of stratospheric aerosol layer formation is built.
The following processes are considered: input and oxidation of sulfurous gases; sulfuric acid and water vapor condensation on aerosol particles; coagulations, sedimentations and vertical aerosol turbulent transfer; nucleation from sulfuric acid and water vapors; and tropospheric sink of condensation nuclei.
It is shown that the last two processes could change the forecasting feature of the model.
Quantitative regularities of anthropogenic growth of CSO impacts on the background aerosol content in the stratosphere and on the climate have been examined on the basis of the model.
The climatic role of this factor will be insignificant up to the end of the century.

On the basis of a developed model, evolution regularities of the stratospheric aerosol layer have been examined after stratospheric input of products from explosive-type volcanic eruptions.
It is shown that, at eruptions like El Chichon (1982), in the initial period following the eruption the formation of fine-dispersed fractions of sulphate aerosol from volcanic products makes a definite contribution to the impact of stratospheric aerosol on climate.
A model assessment is performed of average global air-temperature decrease because of stratospheric aerosols after the El Chichon eruption.

This book is devoted to the detailed treatment of the effect of volcanic eruptions on the Earth`s climate--from a brief description of volcanic eruptions influence on the Earth`s climate up to the monitoring of stratospheric aerosol of volcanic and anthropogenic origin.
Special attention is given to the genesis of stratospheric aerosols, its kinetics and dynamics, climate modeling and analysis of a volcanic eruptions' effect on the Earth`s climate on the basis of empiric data.

Inst. 340:83-91.
The influence of regularities in vertical emission structure on stratospheric aerosol evolution have been examined.
It is shown that the vertical structure of volcanic emissions, as well as their horizontal structure, tends to an increase of the stratosphere cleaning rate after large explosive-type eruptions in comparison with the case when the same amount of injected material is evenly distributed throughout a hemisphere stratosphere.
This effect is increasing as the volcanic emission mass increases in the stratosphere.

The background stratospheric aerosol layer consists mostly of submicron drops of sulfuric acid.
It is formed by photodissociation and oxidation of carbonylsulphide (CS), which is emitted during fuel burning and processing and has mainly an anthropogenic origin.
The role of CS in stratospheric aerosol formation and the possible climatic effects of this process are considered.
Physico-mathematical modeling (earlier developed) of stratospheric aerosol layer has been used, but with condensation nucleus formation processes accounting.
The author's nonstationary energy balance model has been used for change evaluations of thermal atmosphere regime, caused by the stratospheric aerosol content change.
Augmentation of airborne emission of sulfurous gases may lead to an impact on climate commensurable in scale with the climatic effects of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and freon.

Numerical calculations showed that vapor condensation of meteorite material took place at a height of 80-100 km.
At altitudes below 50 km an intense formation of aerosol particles occurs with the mass of m 10^-14 g caused by coagulation process, which are most effective in light scattering.
As a result, a rapid increase of atmospheric turbidity s = [sigma2.gif] [a]
This gives, for the first time, the physical mechanism of light-scattering aerosol layer formation in the upper stratosphere, revealed during twilight observations.

The article reports a new phenomenon discovered by the authors during an aircraft sounding-aerosol cloud formation in the atmosphere, during clear sky conditions.
They've got typical sizes of 20-40 km horizontal, 400-1000 m vertical.
Aerosol concentration in clouds is approximately an order of magnitude higher than in an ambient area.
They are generally observed when the relative air humidity is less than 40%, at a height of more than 1000 m above the Earth's surface.
In summary, a hypothesis for a mechanism of their formation is expressed.

General regularities of formation conditions, inner structure, and disperse composition of uncondensed aerosol clouds were found on the basis of analyses of chemical composition, optic and microphysical aerosol characteristics, in and out of a cloud meteorological parameters, and synoptic situation in the region of observations.
A mechanism of formation of such clouds, consisting of the fact that, in some instances, nonconvective flows carry the aerosol through the inversion layer, is well founded.

Results of an experimental submicron aerosol-fraction study, received in 1986 from an aircraft atmospheric sounding at a height of 0 to 5 km, are considered.
From the aircraft, measurements of aerosol number concentration and aerosol scattering coefficient in the mixing layer are well identified, and, for monthly mean values, a correlation methodic allowing an introduction of objective height criteria of this layer is applicable.
With a view to study the physical-chemical aerosol properties and their optic parameter measurements of aerosol scattering coefficients at artificial air, wetting from 0 to 95% and heating from 20Ã¯Â¿Â½ C to 250Ã¯Â¿Â½ C were conducted on board the aircraft-laboratory.
On the basis of the received thermo- and gigrogramm parameter estimations of condensation activity, and total volatile substance content in dry aerosol base are made.
Formation peculiarities of the mixing layer, as well as optic and microphysical aerosol characteristic dynamics in different seasons, have been examined.

Low air layer mean temperature dependence on aerosol particle mass in the stratosphere has been examined.
The mass of optically active aerosol particles, which decreases the accumulated radiation by 1%, is equal to 0.8*10^-6 g/cm^3 and results in reducing mean temperature at earth surface by 1.5Ã¯Â¿Â½ C. Mean air temperature reduction during natural aerosol catastrophes, caused by volcanic eruptions or meteorite fall, has been reaching 5-10Ã¯Â¿Â½ C.
Such natural climatic catastrophes in geological past led to mass organism die-off.
Evaluations indicate that after a nuclear conflict, because of aerosol emission in the stratosphere, mean air temperature decrease can be expected in the northern hemisphere of about 5-10Ã¯Â¿Â½ C, but at continents at 10-20Ã¯Â¿Â½ C, that could lead to heavy consequences for many living things.
Humanity destruction as a result of direct effect of nuclear bombs, and because of ecological crisis, is possible.
Such temperature decreases would be destructive to the agricultural manufacturing system.

The first traces of the Pinatubo eruption emerged above West Siberia in late June, slightly more than two weeks after the eruption, which agrees with speed and air mass trajectory on these altitudes and in this period of time.
Maximum stratosphere filling by volcanic aerosol was registered on the 21st and 22nd of January 1992.
Dispersion relations, determined during this period for the wavelength of 532 nm, have been receiving values of 9.5 at a height of 23.5 km.
Such values were registered above Tomsk for the first time in the last 6 years of regular lidar observations.

On the basis of a zonally averaged model of impurity transport from local source the dependence of typical lifetimes of various volcanic aerosol particles in the stratosphere from volcanoe location and emission height of its eruption products has been considered.
It is shown that the lifetime of particles caght in stratosphere essentially depends on their source disposition latitude.
Two typical zones (0-30Ã¯Â¿Â½ and 35-65Ã¯Â¿Â½ N) are outlined, for which this length of lifetime may be different by several times.
Obtained evaluations can be used for analysis of the impact of volcanic eruptions on climate.

A model of vertical atmosphere thermal structure, which considers a diurnal run of boundary layer processes, is suggested.
Optic and microphysical pollution parameters are representative for the urban aerosols.
Calculations are realized for various values of aerosol haze densities and vertical length.
Numerical experiments showed that aerosol pollution of the atmosphere boundary layer creates conditions for surface and surface air temperatures rising whereas during significant pollution of thick troposphere layers the surface layer climate varies in the direction of cooling.

Numerical experiments show that the abrupt pollution of powerful troposphere layers creates conditions for temperature reduction.
Intense cloud formation in low troposphere layers is promoting the significant decrease-of-cooling aerosol effect.

It is recommended to classify models by type (nature) of the simulated characteristics and by level of the process description complexity.
Three types and four levels of the existing aerosol models are outlined.
The models are classified as structural, physicochemical, and optic.
On the first level microphysical aerosol characteristics are considered.
Models of the second level are based on empirical relations between average values of aerosol parameters.
In the third level models, the space time transformation of aerosol characteristics is being considered.
Models of the fourth level--forecasting--are in their beginning stages at the present time.
The present state of aerosol models has been analyzed.

It is shown that the presence of large quantities of strongly absorbing aerosol in the lower atmosphere the meteorological visibility range (MVR) depends not only on aerosol quantity in the sight line, but also on vertical layer thickness.
As in this case, the lower layer part illumination could decrease to such an extent that the threshold contrast meaning is noticeably increased.
This dependence makes it possible to estimate aerosol emission capacity.

Anthropogeneous climate impacts are discussed, in particular, the role of minor, optically active gaseous components and carbon dioxide gas in greenhouse effect formation.
A reliable forecast of anthropogenic climate changes in the next 50-100 years is not possible due to uncertainty in the forecast of industrial development, lack of global carbon cycle understanding, and absence of reliable climate theory.
The problem of the various component cycles in the biosphere as a climate formation factor has been considered in detail.
Problematic aspects of climate change studies are stated.
Atmospheric aerosol and its climatic effect (aerosol classification by composition and sources, natural and anthropogenic aerosol, photochemical and chemical mechanisms of aerosol formation, aerosol radiation regime impact) are discussed in detail.
Prospects of further developments in aerosol investigations as a climate forming factor are outlined.

The influence of atmospheric aerosol on long-wave radiation is analyzed.
In this case the same assumptions are accepted, as made during the examination of aerosol influence on short-wave radiation; aerosol dispersion and absorption are the basic processes, dispersion absorption coefficients are normalized relative to the coefficient at ( [lambda.gif] = 0.55 Ã¯Â¿Â½m, long-wave spectrum was divided on three spectral ranges, in each of them the optical characteristics are given by averages.
Desert aerosols and aerosols raised by air flows on a certain height and forming a dust cloud render the strongest influence on the long-wave radiation.
For the calculation of long-wave flows, Eddington and two-stream approximations are used.
Computation results have been compared with similar calculations of other scientists.
Discrepancies have been analyzed.
Aerosol influence on long-wave flows is shown through the change of efficient flows at the Earth's surface.

A long-term series (1883-1981) of direct solar radiation observational data derived at 20 stations in the Northern Hemisphere is given.
From the change of solar radiation at plain and mountain stations for synchronous time periods (during 1958-1981), an approximate evaluation is given of the influence of anthropogenic factors and volcanic activity upon radiation attenuation.
The contribution of volcanic eruptions in the formation of direct radiation variability during the recent two decades is varying (in dependence on the assumed techniques of evaluation) in the 3.8-1.9% range.
The decrease of direct radiation due to anthropogenic factors is essentially less, and the average trend is 0.1% over each year during the period under consideration.

Aerosol is considered as a nearly stationary process of particle formation, development, and scavenging.
Notions of background aerosol, aerosol weather, and aerosol climate as an ensemble of aerosol states and transformation processes are introduced.
A scheme for basic processes is formulated, that is, the synthesis of vapor of aerosol-forming substances (VAFS) and clusters and the heterogeneous condensation, coagulation, humidization, and scavenging of thin-dispersive particles.
On the basis of kinetic theory, each process is described for stationary conditions that lead to a chain of relationships determining the basic parameters of an aerosol system if two external parameters are known, e.g., the concentration of VAFS and the characteristic life-time of the submicron fraction.
The scheme developed is proposed as a kinetic model of tropospheric aerosol.

On the basis of the solution of an integrodifferential equation of radiative transfer, the effect of aerosol on the formation of outgoing thermal radiation in the 400-2685 cm^-1 spectral region has been examined for various aerosol models.
The effect of aerosol in terms of the radiation brightness temperature is shown to constitute 0.1-0.4 K for a clean atmosphere and can reach 2.0-4.0 K for a turbid atmosphere.
The contribution of aerosol scattering to the formation of outgoing thermal radiation can amount to 5-10%.

This monograph is concerned with the problem of constructing optical models of the atmosphere on the basis of statistically valid composition data.
The analysis of the problem is given both for the dispersed media (such as hazes, clouds, mists, precipitation) taking into account the specific features of their microphysics (concentration, particle size spectrum, coefficients of material refraction), and for gas composition of the atmosphere based on modern views on its altitude variations in the atmosphere.
The authors concentrate on the problem of the effect of reference microphysical and meteorological data on the reliability of model evaluations.
Extensive information is presented on high-altitude and spectral behavior of the basic optical parameters of dispersed and gaseous atmospheric fractions.
Some applications of these subjects are discussed in the problems on laser sounding of the atmosphere.
