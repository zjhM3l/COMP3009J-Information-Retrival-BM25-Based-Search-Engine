Celebrating and Sharing the Holidays NIEHS employees used the holiday season and two holiday-oriented events -- the Dec. 5 International Day observance and the Dec. 16 Award Ceremony Reception/Holiday Party -- to share the holiday traditions of their various cultures.
The party honored the winners of the NIH Merit Awards and other award winners from 1997.
On Dec. 5, the Institute drummed in International Day with a noontime cafeteria performance by a group of young drummers from Durham, NC, (pictured at right).
Later in the day, five NIEHS employees -- Kiyo Itagaki of Japan, Maxim Koriabine of Russia, Molly Vallant of India, Gordon Ibeanu of Nigeria and Burhan Ghanayem of Palestine -- shared holiday traditions in their native lands.

First Environments kids Eager kids from the Institute's daycare, First Environments, wait for presents from Santa Claus.
Where's Santa? He was cut out of the picture with the kids, but managed to end up right in the middle of things with Director Ken Olden.
