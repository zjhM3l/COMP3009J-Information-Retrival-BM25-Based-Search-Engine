More and more attorneys are recognizing e-mail's potential as a source of unguarded information about companies they are suing.
When someone sues a company, the rules of discovery demand that the company produce all relevant business records.
That records reside in a computer or backup tape rather than a filing cabinet doesn't make any difference to the court.
Nor do courts care whether records are official rather than reference copies.
