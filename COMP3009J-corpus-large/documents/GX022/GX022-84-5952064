The Skate Park.
The Skate Park has been constructed at the northwest corner of the Jerome Smith Road Parking Lot.
April 7, 2003 Annual Town Meeting voters approved $50,000 for this project, which has been a priority for the Recreation Commission and the Board of Selectmen.
The skate park creates a recreational outlet for an extremely popular sport, and will relieve the hazards and congestion caused by skaters on Commercial Street.
The skate park's cost of $89,670 includes $74,670 for ramps, jumps, rails, wedges, quarter pipes, spines and fun boxes, plus $15,000 for paving, fencing, signage and contingencies.
The Recreation Commission is raising $40,000 for this project through private donations.
On October 22, 2001, the Board of Selectmen voted, pursuant to MGL Chapter 44, section 53A, to establish a "Skate Park Gift Fund" with the balance in said fund to be expended without further appropriation by the Board of Selectmen for expenses associated with a skate park.
Further donations are welcome!
