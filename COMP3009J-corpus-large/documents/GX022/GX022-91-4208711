Treatment of Prostate Cancer
Charles Sawyers, M.D. UCLA

Carcinoma of the prostate is predominantly a tumor of older men, which frequently responds to treatment when widespread and may be cured when localized.
The rate of tumor growth varies from very slow to moderately rapid, and some patients may have prolonged survival even after the cancer has metastasized to distant sites, such as to bone.
Since the median age at diagnosis is 72 years, many patients, especially those with localized tumor, may die of other illnesses without ever having suffered significant disability from their cancer.
The approach to treatment is influenced by age and coexisting medical problems.
Side effects of various forms of treatment should be considered in selecting appropriate management.
State-of-the-art treatment in prostate cancer provides prolonged disease-free survival for many patients with localized disease, but is rarely curative in patients with locally extensive tumor.
Even when the cancer appears clinically localized to the prostate gland, a substantial fraction of patients will develop disseminated tumor after local therapy with surgery or irradiation.
This is due to the high incidence of clinical understaging even with current diagnostic techniques.
Metastatic tumor is currently not curable.
Treatment of locally confined disease
Surgery
Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of late stage prostate cancer.
Some of the most active agents currently in use today include estramustine, docetaxol, mitoxantrone and carboplatin.
These patients should have a negative bone scan and tumors confined to the prostate gland (stages I and II).
Serious toxic effects include bladder outlet injury, urinary incontinence, sexual impotence, and rectal injury.
The technique of cryosurgery is under development.
Radiation Therapy
Candidates for definitive radiation therapy must have a confirmed pathological diagnosis of cancer that is clinically confined to the prostate and/or surrounding tissues (stages I, II, and III).
Patients should have a bone scan and computed tomographic scan negative for metastases, but staging laparotomy and lymph node dissection are not required.
Interstitial brachytherapy has been employed in several centers, generally for patients with T1 and T2 tumors.
Patients are selected for favorable characteristics, including low Gleason score, low PSA level, and stage T1 to T2 tumors.
Information and further study are required to better define the effects of modern interstitial brachytherapy on disease control and quality of life, and to determine the contribution of favorable patient selection to outcomes.
Watchful waiting Asymptomatic patients of advanced age or with concomitant illness may warrant consideration of careful observation without immediate active treatment, especially those patients with low-grade and early-stage tumors.
The variable history of carcinoma of the prostate emphasizes the need for randomized studies to identify the statistical benefit of any definitive treatment.
Treatment of metastatic disease
Hormone therapy
Testosterone can help prostate cancer grow.
To stop the cancer from growing, female hormones or drugs that decrease production of male hormones may be given.
Many different forms of hormone therapy exist.
High dose estrogen therapy (diethyl stilbesterol) can prevent the testes from producing testosterone.
However, estrogens are seldom used today in the treatment of prostate cancer because of the risk of serious side effects.
LHRH (leutinizing hormone releasing hormone) agonists such as leuprolide also can prevent the testicles from producing testosterone.
Anti-androgens such as flutamide and bicalutamide can block the action of testosterone at the level of the androgen receptor.
Drugs such s ketoconazole and aminoglutethamide prevent the synthesis of androgen by the adrenal gland and are sometimes used to achieve maximal androgen blockade.
Orchietomy is surgery to remove the testicles, the main source of male hormones, to decrease hormone production.
Hot flashes, impaired sexual function, and loss of desire for sex may occur in men treated with hormone therapy.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of late stage prostate cancer.
Some of the most active agents currently in use today include estramustine, docetaxol, mitoxantrone and carboplatin.
