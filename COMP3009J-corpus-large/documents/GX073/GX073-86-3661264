Sequence of Activities 1.
In Lesson 5, children conducted interviews with family members about a family holiday.
Review with the children the concepts of history, tradition and culture.
They asked and recorded responses to the following questions:
What is a special family holiday? How do we celebrate this holiday? What family members participate? Is this holiday reflective of our family's cultural or religious background? Will I celebrate this holiday when I'm a grown up? Why or why not?
2.
Assign the children to small groups, and explain that individually, they are going to share their answers, drawings/photographs and any other artifacts they may have brought to school that represent the family's holiday.
Encourage the children to ask each other questions about the holiday for further inquiry or clarification.
If children celebrate the same holiday, suggest they compare and contrast their holiday experiences.
3.
Following the small group discussions, conduct a class discussion about what the children learned from their peers.
Discuss the fact that although families may celebrate the same holiday, they may do so in different ways.
Discuss how some holidays reflect families' cultural or religious backgrounds.
4.
As a class, select one holiday that is celebrated by two families.
Draw a Venn diagram where the similarities of the celebration are placed where the circles overlap, and the differences are placed where the circles diverge.
Use the Venn diagram to reinforce how each family is the same in some ways, but different in others in respect to the ways they celebrate the holiday.
Assessment
Assessment occurs in the small groups when children are observed as they present the results of their interviews.
A second assessment involves using the results of two interviews of the same holiday and instructing children to independently create a Venn diagram and make conclusions about what they have learned.
Application Beyond School
Children read stories about how families celebrate a particular cultural holiday and compare and contrast that with their own ways of celebrating.
Parents and children bring to school artifacts and food that are part of their family holiday.
Connections
Arts
Children draw pictures of a family celebrating a holiday.
It may be their own or another family.
English Language Arts
Children use reading skills when they report their findings.
When children share the results of their interviews, they practice the speaker's craft.
