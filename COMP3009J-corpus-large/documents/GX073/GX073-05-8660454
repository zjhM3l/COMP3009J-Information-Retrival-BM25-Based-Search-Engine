Orange production fell 24 percent below last season's record crop and grapefruit production was down five percent.
Florida accounted for 79 percent of the U.S. citrus production.
California's share dropped to 17 percent due to the December 1998 freeze.
Gains were noted for Arizona and Texas which combined for four percent of the crop.
Navel oranges, grown primarily for fresh consumption, constituted 59 percent of the early-midseason-Navel oranges shipped for the fresh market.
Only the three smallest crops-- limes, lemons, and K-Early Citrus Fruit--recorded production increases.
Although decreases by area ranged from 11-36 percent, four of the five areas produced more than 50 million boxes.
The Southern and Western areas combined for 51 percent of the total.
Bearing acreage for citrus was down one percent, primarily due to the 11 percent decline in grapefruit bearing acreage which was only partially offset by the slight gain in orange bearing acreage.
The only orange variety to show a decline was the Navel.
Among the early tangerines, Fallglo bearing acreage was steady but the other three varieties had losses.
However, the honey tangerine had a gain in bearing acreage.
Although K-Early Citrus lost one-third of the bearing acres, higher yields resulted in a crop twice as large.
Bearing acreage of limes was steady and was up slightly for lemons.
The final FCOJ all orange and early-midseason orange yields reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association surpassed the records previously set in 1992-93.
All oranges were final at 1.633811 gallons of concentrate per box while the early-midseason yield was 1.584139.
At 1.748058 gallons of concentrate per box, the late (Valencia) oranges set a record for the second consecutive season.
California suffered declines in production as a result of a December freeze.
Grapefruit was least affected with a six percent decrease in production from the previous season.
The orange crop was 45 percent smaller and tangerines and lemons were down 38 percent.
Despite a decline in bearing acreage, the Texas grape fruit crop was 27 percent greater than in 1997-98.
Small decreases in bearing acreage and production of oranges were noted.
Large percentage increases occurred for the Arizona lemon, tangerine, and Navel orange crops.
Bearing acreage held steady for tangerines but decreased for other varieties.

VALUE
The preliminary on-tree value of the 1998-99 citrus crop surpassed $1.1 billion and is higher than the revised values for the previous six seasons.
This value is over 12 percent higher than last season's revised value of $1.0 billion.
The average weighted price per box and crop value was higher this season for each of the varieties.
Preliminary value is based on that part of the crop priced at harvest, which accounts for all of the fresh fruit and about 40 percent of the processed.
Nearly one-half of the processed oranges were priced but the figure for processed grapefruit and tangerines is about one-quarter of the total.

1998-99 FLORIDA WEATHER HIGHLIGHTS, SELECTED AREAS, AND MONTHS
The beginning of 1998 was mild and warm with scat tered rains.
A few nights during January had temperatures in the 40's, however the month was generally moderate with some new growth showing by the end of the month.
February was a very wet month with ponds, lakes and water reservoirs showing very high levels.
New growth and bloom buds rapidly formed by the end of February with the help of the abundant rainfall during the first two months of the year.
March was cold; however, some blooming occurred during the first two weeks.
The bloom lagged during the later part of the month.
By the middle of April most trees had completed the bloom cycle as warmer weather arrived.
Moisture levels during April were adequate; however, virtually all of May was hot and dry and caretakers ran irrigation around the clock to help set the new crop of fruit.
Only a few light scattered showers fell in May and early June.
Record high temperatures were reported in many areas of the citrus belt during June.
Groves without irrigation showed leaf curl and wilt.
Some new crop fruit suffered from the extreme heat and lack of rainfall.
Very few areas reported surplus rainfall throughout the summer.
Growers and caretakers found it necessary to irrigate on a recurring basis.
By the end of the summer most new crop fruit was in very good condition and there was an abundance of new growth on trees of all ages.
The 1998-99 harvest season got underway the last of August with shipments of colored seedless grapefruit from the lower interior of the citrus region.
By the end of September, packers were shipping white and colored seedless grapefruit, Navel oranges, and Fallglo tangerines.
Most fresh fruit packinghouses were open and shipping all varieties of early fruit by the first of November.
Tropical Storm Mitch dumped several inches of rain on the southern part of the citrus belt the first week of Novem ber.
However, the rest of the month was very dry and growers were irrigating to maintain good tree condition.
Cool tempera tures arrived around the middle of December.
There was still not enough rain; therefore, caretakers were irrigating again.
The dry conditions continued through the end of December.
On January 3 and 4, 1999, temperatures fell below freezing in several areas of the citrus belt.
However, tempera tures were not low enough for a long enough period of time to cause serious damage to most citrus crops.
Minimal icing was found in some fruit; however, picking crews rapidly moved most damaged crops to the processors.
February was gener ally a dry month with very little new growth showing except on young trees in the southern part of the citrus belt.
Bloom buds were forming the first of March on some trees.
Cool temperatures followed by dry weather extended the bloom period making it one of the longest in recent history.
Bloom continued and increased throughout March.
Trees continued to bloom during April and May, which were dry months.
Fruit of all sizes was found on many trees of all types and varieties.
Heavy rains the last half of June provided much needed surface soil moisture.
The rest of the summer was about normal with some dry areas and some wet groves.
Charted below is the historical average of monthly rainfall which includes data from two stations in each of the citrus producing areas.
The ten stations are: Arcadia, Avon Park (2 W), Clermont (7 S), Clewiston (US Army Corps of Engineers), Immokalee (3 NNW), Lake Alfred (Experiment Station), Orlando (International Airport), Plant City, Stuart (1 N), and Vero Beach (4 W).

PRICES
All prices reported in this publication are on-tree prices representing the average price received by growers for their fruit.
The term "on-tree" relates to fruit returns to the grower after the costs of picking, hauling, and packing have been removed.
Prices are based on records of commercial fresh fruit sales and processed fruit returns.
Each season, beginning with the first month that three percent of a fruit type is harvested, monthly estimates are computed.
Reports from fresh fruit sales organizations and from packers provide data for an average f.o.b. price.
Processors report an average spot and cash price for fruit delivered to their plants.
From these values, an estimated charge for picking, hauling, and packing is deducted to arrive at an on-tree price.
The anticipated box utilization for the month is used to combine the fresh and processing price to obtain an average price for all methods of sales.
At the end of the season, monthly price averages are computed and weighted by boxes utilized, to provide the preliminary season average price.
A year later, after most processed products are sold, cooperatives and firms with participation plans report prices of fruit they handled.
These prices, combined with the spot and cash prices collected earlier, are weighted together by varieties to determine the final processing price received by growers.
From this price, charges for picking, hauling, and packing, as estimated by University of Florida economists, are deducted to arrive at the final on-tree price received by growers.
These preliminary figures for the season just ended, the revised figures for the previous season, and county production by type are released annually in late September.
COUNTY PRODUCTION
Estimates of citrus production by counties were prepared using objective survey data obtained from the citrus crop estimates program.
Production for Florida has been distributed to counties based on the biennial citrus tree census, limb count survey data adjusted for droppage to end of season, and size data at maturity.
Tree numbers by county which are used in the estimates were obtained from the latest tree census.
Productivity per tree is obtained from several objective fruit surveys including limb count, size, and droppage.
Because of the statistical sampling design, counties with higher production in general have a greater number of samples and, therefore, estimates for these counties can be considered more reliable.
Thus, for the same reason, estimates for the production areas are more reliable than for the individual counties.
TREE CENSUS
The Florida Agricultural Statistics Service first indexed the State's commercial citrus groves on aerial photography as of January 1966.
Ground crews identify all the State's groves by fruit type, row spacing, and year in which set.
Photo interpreters in the Orlando office then delineate the groves by variety blocks on photo transparencies at a scale of 1 inch to 660 feet.
Variety blocks are measured with planimeters to obtain acreage and then indexed by land section.
The design of the inventory survey allows for quick and economical updating.
Since 1966, the citrus belt has been resurveyed each second winter to determine changes.
Photographing begins in November when weather conditions are most favorable and is generally completed in 80 to 90 days.
The same three-mile-wide flight lines established in 1966 are photographed on each succeeding flight.
Approxi mately 14,000 square miles of photography are obtained at a 1 to 30,000 scale.
The last statewide survey was conducted as of January 1998.
However, all grapefruit groves were re-surveyed in 1999.
Although new plantings during the one year period equaled about half the amount set during the previous two year interval, the loss rate was much higher resulting in a net loss of acreage equal to that of the previous two year interval.
The Indian River District had a net loss of 6,576 acres.
The largest reduction by type was in white seedless grapefruit.
Photographing began in November 1999 for the survey now underway.
Field work will update the acreage records as of January 2000.

HISTORY OF FLORIDA'S CITRUS INDUSTRY
The citrus tree is a native of the Orient.
From there it was carried ever westward by man, to India, to the Mediterranean, and on across the Atlantic.
Citrus was brought to the Americas by Columbus.
When he landed on November 22, 1493, he brought citrus seeds that were planted on the island of Haiti.
The first seeds planted on the mainland of the Americas were brought by the expedition of Juan de Grijalva when he landed in Central America between July 12 and July 20, 1518.
The exact date of the introduction of citrus trees into Florida is not known, but from a statement made by Pedro Medendez, dated April 2, 1579, it appears that citrus fruits were grown in abundance around St. Augustine at that time.
Early settlers in Florida some two centuries later found wild citrus trees scattered over the State.
One of the oldest cultivated groves planted in Florida (Hume, 1926 p. 95) is thought to have been the Don Phillipe grove in Pinellas County, planted sometime between 1809 and 1820.
Nearly 1.5 million boxes were shipped in 1887-88, the first season on record.
Citrus production in Florida had reached an all time high of more than 5 million boxes when the Great Freeze of 1894-95 almost totally wiped out the citrus industry.
It was not until 1909-10 that this level was reached again.
In 1998-99, Florida produced 242.9 million boxes representing 79 percent of the Nation's citrus production.
