TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ ALLOZYME VARIATION IN DOMESTICATED HELIANTHUS ANNUUS AND WILD RELATIVES: A SURVEY OF SELECTED ACCESSIONS FROM THE NATIONAL PLANT GERMPLASM SYSTEM Author(s): CRONN RICHARD C BROTHERS MARY E KLIER KAREN M BRETTING PETER K WENDEL JONATHAN F Interpretive Summary:
Sunflower is the second most important oilseed in the world, with an annual crop worth billions of dollars.
The U. S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) has a special responsibility to conserve genetic materials of sunflower, one of the few crops of worldwide importance that originated, and is genetically most variable, in the continental U. S.
The NPGS collection of sunflower genetic material, the most comprehensive in the world, is invaluable for sunflower crop improvement and basic scientific research.
Genetic variation in a large sample of wild-growing and cultivated sunflower from the NPGS collection was studied with a newly-refined molecular technique, yielding one of the more extensive databases of genetic information available for any crop.
It was found that wild sunflowers from the U. S. Great Plains are genetically more variable than those elsewhere, and were genetically different from wild sunflowers of California and the U. S. Southwest.
Wild and cultivated sunflowers were genetically distinguishable, and wild sunflowers from the Great Plains may be the ancestors of cultivated sunflowers.
In addition to providing valuable basic scientific information, this research will have the impact of firmly establishing this molecular analysis as a tool for managing invaluable sunflower genetic material more effectively, leading to cost-savings.
This research may also make the genetic material easier to use in sunflower breeding, leading to an improved crop that is higher yielding and more resistant to adverse weather and pest infestations.
