CHARACTERIZATION OF DUPLICATED GENES IN BRASSICA
OBJECTIVES: Our goals are: 1) to determine the distribution and genetic organization of two A. thaliana gene segments in Brassica nigra.
These consist of genes AB11, RPS2 and CK1 on chromosome 4, and genes p67 translation factor, Em-like protein and chlorophyll synthase on chromosome 3, and 2) to determine the level of duplication of these segments as well as their fine physical map in Brassica nigra.
APPROACH: Southern hybridization of B. nigra F2 genomic blots for Pst1, EcoRV and HindIII with all A. thaliana cDNA and genomic DNA probes available for the chromosome 3 complex will be carried out to analyze F2 segregation and complete the linkage analysis.
A bacteriophage P1 library will be constructed for B. nigra nuclear DNA.
This will be screened with A. thaliana sequences under study.
Insert size and physical linkage will be determined by PFGE.
A restriction map for each cloned long DNA segment will be prepared by Southern hybridization using the Arabidopsis clones.
Clone specific restriction maps will be constructed using a series of rare cutting endonucleases.
Restriction fragments carrying coding sequences will be subcloned to perform fine physical mapping.
Partial nucleotide sequencing of the coding as well as non-coding fragments will be carried out.
PROGRESS: 1996/01 TO 1996/12 The main goal of this proposal is to gain insight into the nature of gene duplication in BRASSICA species.
We are following up in BRASSICA OLERACEA six single copy genes forming part of two gene segments on chromosomes 3 and 4 of A. THALIANA: ABI1, RPS2 (Pseudomonas syringae resistance) and CK1 on chromosome 4, and p67 translation factor, Em-like protein and chlorophyll synthase on chromosome 3.
Our preliminary studies reveal that these genes are present in multiple copies on various chromosomes in BRASSICA.
They are being studied in terms of their genome distribution, and sequence modifications in duplicated members.
For this purpose, a cosmid library in the SuperCosI plasmid (Stratagen) was constructed for BRASSICA OLERACEA.
The resulting clones have insert sizes ranging from 23 kb up to 48 kb, with an average of 32kb.
At the present time the library is being screened for the specific A. THALIANA clones.
Their insert sizes will be determined and cosmid contigs constructed to assemble homologous chromosome segments containing the A. THALIANA genes in BRASSICA.
