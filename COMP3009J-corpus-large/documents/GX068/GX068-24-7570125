NUCLEAR MATRIX AND MATRIX-ATTACHMENT REGIONS (MARS) IN HIGHER PLANTS
CONTRACT/GRANT/AGREEMENT NO: 93-37300-8769 GRANT YEAR: 1993
OBJECTIVES: PROJ. #9300938.
The objective of the proposed studies is part of a general problem concerning the relation between genome spatia organization and functional activity.
The aims of the proposed studies are: (1) to isolate and characterize the nuclear skeletal structures (matrices) from different maize and sorghum tissues; (2) to locate, identify and characterize matrix-attachment sites on a vast continuum of DNA around the maize Adh1-gene and the homologous region in sorghum.
A parallel study of the spatial organization of MARs (SARs) elements will indicate the degree of evolutionary conservation of loop placement, loop-related sequence organization and loop-related regulation of genetic function; (3) to study the relation between the functional state of the gene (expressed vs repressed) and chromatin loop-folding (respectively attachment to the matrix); (4) the role, if any, of the repetitive sequences bordering the Adh-1 locus in chromatin folding and its possible impact on gene activity will be studied; (5) to map the position of the attachment sites with respect to structural and functional components of the Adh1 regions in maize and sorghum.
APPROACH: On the basis of the already established by us protocol, nuclear skeletal structures (matrices) will be isolated from different maize and sorghum tissues, corresponding to those isolated from animal systems.
Plant nuclei will be subjected to both high-salt and low-salt extraction methods.
Matrix attachment regions (MARs) will be identified by both in vivo and in vitro binding assay (as already established).
The availability of clones covering a large (ca. 500 kbp) region around the Adh-1 gene in maize and the corresponding region in sorghum presents the rare opportunity to compare the spatial organization and folding of two related genomes which are homologous but different in size.
The possible involvement of the MAR located 5 to the maize Adh-1 gene in the genes expression will be studied by in vivo assays with green-leaf nuclei (Adh-1 is off) and with induced root nuclei (the Adh-1 is on).
The gene will be anaerobically induced in root cells by a standard technique.
The mapping of the MARs in regions reach in repetitive sequences will be performed by the in vitro binding approach.
Subcloning, sequencing and comparison of identified MAR will be carried out by standard techniques.
PROGRESS: 9410 TO 9509 A major objective of the proposed studies was to compare the degree of homology and colinearity in the genomes of two related species: maize and sorghum.
A BAC chromosome, with a 165 kbp insert from the sorghum genomic region, containing the Adh1 gene was provided to us by Dr. Rod Wing (Texas A and M University) and compared with the respective genomic region of maize.
As a result of extensive restriction map analysis and sequencing of large portions of the regions, a tight colinearity was established between the two species.
This colinearity extended for more than 300 kbp for the maize.
All low-copy number DNA sequences have been preserved in sequence composition and order in the two species, making it possible for a high- fidelity genome cross-referencing.
The results of these studies have provided us with the necessary clones, probes and information for carrying out experiments aimed at studying the possible genome colinearity at a structural level.
Concurrently, similar experiments are to be performed with the colinear genomic regions of sorghum and rice from the regions containing the A1/Sh2 genes.
