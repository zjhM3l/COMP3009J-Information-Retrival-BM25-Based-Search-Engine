Conflict Analyses of Cambodia
Although dated, the following two documents highlight how the quality of conflict analysis can provide an accurate picture of conflict dynamics and change.
In particular, the documents highlight what can be learned from greater attention being paid to local voices, including the opinions of refugee and displaced populations, rather than simply those identified as civil society or political leaders.
Both documents are provided courtesy of Kenneth Michael Quinn.
* The Origins and Development of Radical Cambodian Communism [available via email request] by Kenneth Michael Quinn (Dissertation submitted to the Faculty of the Graduate School of the University of Maryland, 1982) This document seeks to explain: + How Pol Pot and his followers gained power in Cambodia.
+ What their goals were in instituting a radical new social and economic order.
+ What ideological underpinnings permitted violence and terror to be utilized so extensively.
A review of original party documents, statements by Pol Pot and other Communist leaders, interviews with refugees and assessments by noted scholars and authors were used to describe how Pol Pot achieved power and the origins of his radical political philosophy.
This document is particularly interesting and relevant in demonstrating what can be learned from refugee populations.
* Political Change in Wartime: The Khmer Krahom Revolution in Southern Cambodia, 1970-1974 [available via email request] by Kenneth Michael Quinn (courtesy of Naval War College Review, Spring 1976: 3-31)
