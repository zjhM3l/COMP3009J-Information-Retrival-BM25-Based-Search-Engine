[News from Congressman Chris Smith - 4th New Jersey Denouncing Icelands Travel Ban Against Falun Gong Practitioners Travel Restrictions Are Disappointing and Ugly WASHINGTON, D.C.
Congressman Chris Smith, Vice Chairman of the House Committee on International Relations, today denounced the government of Icelands decision to ban Falun Gong practitioners from visiting the Western European nation during a visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
Iceland has banned Falun Gong practitioners from traveling to Iceland between June 7 to June 18, coinciding with Chinese President Jiang Zemins visit.
An Icelandic media source, The Morgunblad, has written that it has reliable sources that Chinese authorities have demanded from the Icelanders that Falun Gong members not be in the country during the visit.
They have even demanded that no protesters be seen from the Saga Hotel where Jiang Zemin will stay.
Falun Gong is outlawed in China and practitioners are beaten and jailed.
The U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for China in 2001 states that thousands of organizers and adherents of the banned Falun Gong movement were in reeducation-through-labor camps or in prison....Various sources reported that over 200 Falun Gong practitioners died in detention as a result of torture or mistreatment.
The actions of Iceland, a democratic government and member of NATO, are disappointing and ugly, said Smith, who also serves as Co-Chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission.
On Tuesday, Smith wrote a letter to Iceland Prime Minister David Oddsson urging him to lift the travel ban immediately.
As an original participating state in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Iceland has established itself as a consistent voice in support of democracy and human rights.
Against this backdrop, the government directive instructing the national airlines, IcelandAir, to cancel the tickets of Falun Gong members intending to protest Mr. Zemins policies is particularly disturbing, Smith wrote.
Chinas repressive tactics used to squelch speech and demonstrations are horrific enough when they take place in China.
Its even worse when China exports its repression to foreign nations under the guise of safety and public order, Smith said.
Neither Iceland nor any other democratic government should give in to the totalitarian practices of China.
We must stand up for freedom if we are to have any hope of moving repressive states like China to improve their records, he added.
The blatant appeasement which the Icelandic government is now practicing would probably make even Neville Chamberlain blush with embarrassment.
