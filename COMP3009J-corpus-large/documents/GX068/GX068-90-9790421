OK, you've got your Grammy and Emmy Awards, but what about the Audie Awards? For those in the audiobook world, the Audie Awards are just as prestigious as any Emmy or Grammy.
Last month, the Eighth Annual Audio Awards were awarded by the Audio Publishers Association.
The APA is a not-for-profit trade organization consisting of over 200 member companies including publishers, resellers, distributors, and suppliers, along with other industries related to the production, promotion and sale of audiobooks.
Qualifying audiobooks are defined as sound recordings containing at least 51% spoken word content duplicated and packaged for sale in the United States as cassettes or compact discs.
Recordings must have been produced originally or compiled from another medium for release as audiobooks.
Audiobooks need not be derived from or based on a printed book.
Listed below are this year's finalists and winners.
The winners in each category are indicated by an asterisk (*) in front of the winning title.
Selection as a finalist indicates superb recordings that are well worth your consideration when selecting audiobook titles for your library.
