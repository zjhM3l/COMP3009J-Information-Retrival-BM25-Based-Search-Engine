OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this project are to further understand the genome structure ofsoybeans.
This includes the arrangement of duplicate genetic material that arose during the evolution of soybean.
We will measure the similarity of the duplications and characterize their arrangement in the genome.
APPROACH: The duplicate genetic material will sequences at multiple loci to understand itssimilarities and differences.
The duplicate genetic material will be identified by using recombinant DNA probes that hybridize to two genetic locations.
Large regions of duplicated material will be studied following cloning into P1 phage vectors.
Complete libraries of P1 phage will be constructed for this purpose.
PROGRESS: 9207 TO 9507 In this research we have characterized the duplicate soybean genomes by restriction fragment analysis, direct sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis.
1) A comprehensive analysis of duplication of restriction fragment duplication was carried out using nearly 700 RFLP probes that represented over 1,300 genetic loci.
Our results demonstrated that 75 to 85 percent of the soybean is duplicated.
The 15 to 25% that is single copy, may have lost one copy during soybean evolution following the ploidy event that originally duplicate the genome.
Methylaton patterns between duplicated copies appears to be similar.
2) Phage libraries were constructed and duplicate copies of the A199 loci (a 
There was very high sequence homologous (
In noncoding regions, the differences included both point mutations and insert/deletion changes.
3) The evolution of soybean and its duplicate genome was explored by cladistically analyzing sequence data from the soybean A199 loci and similar loci in soybean relatives.
This study established phylogenetic relationships within soybean species and its closely related diploid relatives.
The duplicate soybean genome intersects the "primary" phylogeny between the genus and its diploid relatives.
This suggests that the event occurred after the separation of soybean from these relatives.
