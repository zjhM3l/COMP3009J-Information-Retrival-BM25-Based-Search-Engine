THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH: IN SEARCH OF A NEW PUERTO RICAN CONSENSUS I WANT TO THANK ARTHUR MACEWAN AND ISMAEL RAMÃ¯Â¿Â½REZ SOTO FROM UMASS AND MARI CARMEN APONTE FROM THE PUERTO RICO FEDERAL AFFAIRS ADMINISTRATION FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS IN BOSTON.
FOUR YEARS AGO, MAY 1998, I CAME HERE AS A SPEAKER UPON AN INVITATION BY THE WILLIAM JOINER CENTER TO ADDRESS THE UMASS COMMUNITY ABOUT THE PUERTO RICAN EXPERIENCE--ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.
ON THAT OCCASION, I EXPLAINED HOW THE HISTORY OF THE US-PUERTO RICO RELATIONSHIP IS BEST CHARACTERIZED AS THE STRUGGLE OF THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE AUTONOMY AND DEMOCRACY; AND HOW THE DESIRE FOR AUTONOMY HAD TRANSLATED INTO THE COMMONWEALTH STATUS.
I AM GLAD TO BE BACK THIS YEAR WHEN WE COMMEMORATE ANOTHER CRUCIAL EVENT IN OUR HISTORY.
THIS YEAR WE CELEBRATE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO.
ALL PUERTO RICANS OUGHT TO CELEBRATE OUR CONSTITUTION BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS OUR GREATEST DEMOCRATIC ACHIEVEMENT, AS A PEOPLE, IN THE 20TH CENTURY.
IT IS ALSO A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THIS UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO, AND OPENLY DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES REGARDING OUR POLITICAL STATUS AT THE DAWN OF THE 21ST CENTURY.
BACKGROUND
TO UNDERSTAND PUERTO RICOS REALITY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND OUR HISTORY; A HISTORY THAT ILLUSTRATES, FOR EXAMPLE, WHY PUERTO RICO HAS REPEATEDLY VOTED AGAINST STATEHOOD, AND YET THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICANS TREASURE OUR US CITIZENSHI
P.AND WHY SO MANY PUERTO RICANS HAVE FOUGHT WITH COURAGE AND DIED, AS PART OF THE U.S. MILITARY, IN ALL MAJOR WARS OF THE 20TH CENTURY AND ARE FIGHTING THE PRESENT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM AND YET AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG SENSE OF CULTURAL IDENTITY AND NATIONHOOD.
ALTHOUGH PUERTO RICO WAS UNDER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF SPAIN AT THE OUTBURST OF THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR OF 1898, PUERTO RICO WAS BY THEN A COMMUNITY WITH A STRONG SENSE OF NATIONHOOD.
THE BIRTH OF THAT NATION, IN THE SOCIOLOGICAL SENSE OF THE CONCEPT, CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE LATE 18TH OR EARLY 19TH CENTURY.
BY 1898, ABOUT A MILLION PUERTO RICANS LIVED ON THE ISLAND AND SHARED THAT SENSE OF NATIONAL IDENTITY, A LANGUAGE, A RELIGION AND A COMMON ASPIRATION OF DEMOCRACY AND SELF-GOVERNMENT.
LESS THAN A YEAR BEFORE THE SPANISH WAR, PUERTO RICO HAD FINALLY ACHIEVED FROM SPAIN THE AUTONOMOUS STATUS THAT THEY HAD SOUGHT FOR MANY YEARS.
INDEPENDENCE WAS NEVER THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY UNDER SPANISH RULE NOR WAS TOTAL INTEGRATION TO SPAIN.
AUTONOMY WAS THE ROUTE CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE.
UNDER THE AUTONOMIC CHARTER OF 1897, PUERTO RICO OBTAINED BROAD CIVIL LIBERTIES, A HIGH LEVEL OF AUTONOMY AND SELF-RULE, AND FULL VOTING REPRESENTATION IN SPAIN.
PUERTO RICANS NEVER DREAMED THAT THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE UNITED STATES, THE NATION OF DEMOCRACY AND LIBERTY, WOULD PLACE THEM IN A POLITICAL POSITION LESSER THAN THAT ACHIEVED UNDER SPAIN.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE UNTHINKABLE BECAME A REALITY.
AFTER THE SPANISH- AMERICAN WAR, THE FIRST 40 YEARS OF COLONIAL RULE UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG WERE A POLITICAL FAILURE AND AN ECONOMIC DISASTER.
PUERTO RICO WAS GOVERNED FROM WASHINGTON AND PUERTO RICANS HAD A VERY LIMITED PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS.
REPORTS TALKED ABOUT THE RAGGED, HUNGRY, DISEASED PORTO RICO.
PUERTO RICO CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE POORHOUSE OF THE CARIBBEAN.
DURING THOSE FIRST 40 YEARS THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT BY THE US GOVERNMENT TO AMERICANIZE OR TO CULTURALLY ASSIMILATE PUERTO RICO, THROUGH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THROUGH LOCAL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.
FOR YEARS, ENGLISH WAS THE LANGUAGE OF EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM AND OUR NATIONAL SYMBOLS, LIKE THE PUERTO RICAN FLAG, WERE FORBIDDEN.
BUT AS COULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED THESE POLICIES WORKED TO STRENGTHEN, RATHER THAN WEAKEN, THE IDENTITY AND PERSONALITY OF THE ISLAND.
CULTURE WAS THE ONLY REALM IN WHICH WE COULD PROUDLY DEFEND OUR DIGNITY.
THE GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO, APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1940, ADMIRAL WILLIAM LEAHY, MADE A FAIR AND ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE REALITY OF THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE AT THAT TIME AND I QUOTE: THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS BY LAW, LATINS BY TRADITION, RELIGION AND CUSTOM, AND PUERTO RICANS BY PRIDE AND DEVOTION.
ASSIMILATION HAD, INDEED, FAILED.
IN THAT SAME YEAR, 1940, OUR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGED.
A NEW POLITICAL MOVEMENT, THE POPULAR DEMOCRATIC PARTY, CAME TO POWER, WITH A FORCEFUL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AGENDA THAT JUMPSTARTED THE RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ISLAND.
INDEED, 12 YEARS LATER, IN 1952, THE COMMONWEALTH CONSTITUTION WAS PROCLAIMED BY THE LEADER OF THAT MOVEMENT, GOVERNOR LUIS MUÃ¯Â¿Â½OZ MARÃ¯Â¿Â½N.
WITH PUBLIC LAW 600 OF 1950, CONGRESS BEGAN A PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO WOULD EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION BY DRAFTING THEIR OWN CONSTITUTION.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS ACT WAS NOT IMPOSED BY CONGRESS UPON THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO, BUT IT REPRESENTED AN OFFER THAT COULD BE ACCEPTED OR REJECTED.
SECTION 2 OF THE ACT PROVIDES: THIS ACT SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE QUALIFIED VOTERS OF PUERTO RICO FOR ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION THROUGH AN ISLAND-WIDE REFERENDUM TO BE HELD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF PUERTO RICO.
UPON THE APPROVAL OF THIS ACT BY A MAJORITY OF THE VOTERS PARTICIPATING IN SUCH REFERENDUM, THE LEGISLATURE OF PUERTO RICO IS AUTHORIZED TO CALL A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION TO DRAFT A CONSTITUTION FOR THE SAID ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO.
PUBLIC LAW 600 WAS ADOPTED BY CONGRESS IN THE NATURE OF A COMPACT.
AT THAT MOMENT, THE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS A FORMALIZED COMPACT BECAUSE BY THE TERMS OF THE ACT THE ACCEPTANCE BY THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO WAS PENDING.
PUERTO RICO ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION DRAFTED THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND IN MARCH 1952, THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO RATIFIED IT.
MONTHS LATER, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED PUBLIC LAW 447, APPROVING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
IN THAT JOINT RESOLUTION, CONGRESS EXPRESSED THAT PUBLIC LAW 600 HAD BEEN APPROVED AS A COMPACT WITH THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.
THE COMPACT HAD BEEN FORMALIZED BECAUSE THE OFFER MADE BY CONGRESS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.
FINALLY, IN JULY 25, 1952, GOVERNOR LUIS MUÃ¯Â¿Â½OZ MARÃ¯Â¿Â½N PROCLAIMED THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
AFTER 1952, UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH STATUS, PUERTO RICAN CULTURE FLOURISHED, AND A STRONGER SENSE OF IDENTITY GREW.
OUR SYMBOLS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO OUR PUBLIC LANDSCAPE, OUR FLAG, OUR ANTHEM, ETC.
THE COMMONWEALTH ALLOWED PUERTO RICANS TO FULLY AND FREELY EXPRESS THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR PRIDE.
NOW, THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN TERMS OF CULTURAL IDENTITY, BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A MINORITY TO PRESERVE THEIR CULTURAL VALUES WITHIN A LARGER NATION, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE WILL OF A PEOPLE, TO COLLECTIVELY AFFIRM ITS IDENTITY AND EXISTENCE AMONG THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS.
IT IS A SUBTLE, BUT KEY DISTINCTION TO UNDERSTAND PUERTO RICOS POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS.
THE FORMER DESCRIBES MINORITIES IN THE US SUCH AS ITALIAN-AMERICANS, IRISH-AMERICANS, HISPANIC-AMERICANS IN THE MAINLAND.
THESE MINORITIES PRESERVE CERTAIN CULTURAL TRAITS, BUT FEEL PART AND ENRICH THE AMERICAN MELTING POT.
THE LATTER IS THE CASE OF PUERTO RICO.
PUERTO RICANS IN PUERTO RICO ARE NOT A MINORITY.
UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH OUR CULTURE AND SOCIOLOGICAL IDENTITY IS NOT THREATENED.
OUR COLLECTIVE SENSE-OF-SELF IS MORE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PEOPLE OF A NATION THAN THAT OF A CULTURAL MINORITY WITHIN THE AMERICAN NATION.
LET ME CLARIFY SOMETHING.
FOR A VAST MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICANS THIS STRONG CULTURAL IDENTITY HAS NOT MEANT SUPPORT FOR INDEPENDENCE.
IT HAS, HOWEVER, SIGNIFIED A WILL TO BE SOMETHING ELSE, OTHER THAN A STATE OF THE UNION, WITH A LARGER DEGREE OF AUTONOMY.
THIS HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO THE COMMONWEALTH.
THIS POLITICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL REALITY POSES AN INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE FOR STATEHOOD, BECAUSE STATEHOOD WOULD MEAN, EITHER THAT THE US WOULD BE WILLING TO TRANSFORM ITSELF FROM A ONE-NATION-STATE INTO A MULTI-NATIONAL-STATE, WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY, OR THAT PUERTO RICO WOULD BE WILLING TO BE CULTURALLY ABSORBED INTO THE UNION AND ITS IDENTITY VANISHED, WHICH IS ALSO UNLIKELY.
IN SHORT, PUERTO RICO IS A DISTINCT SOCIETY WITH ALL THE TRAITS OF A NATION IN THE SOCIOLOGICAL SENSE OF THE WORD; A PEOPLE WITH A WILL TO PRESERVE AND PROMOTE ITS IDENTITY.
ANOTHER CENTRAL ASPECT TO UNDERSTAND COMMONWEALTH IS THAT PUERTO RICANS ARE PROUD TO BE US CITIZENS.
US CITIZENSHIP WAS GRANTED TO PUERTO RICANS IN 1917 AS PART OF THE JONES ACT.
HOWEVER, THIS ACT WAS NOT PART OF A PLAN TO INCORPORATE PUERTO RICO TO THE US OR TO FACILITATE EVENTUAL INTEGRATION TO THE FEDERATION AS A STATE.
THIS PRINCIPLE WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED BY PRESIDENT TAFT IN HIS 1912 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, ADVOCATING IN FAVOR OF A BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS TO GRANT AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP TO ALL PUERTO RICANS, WHERE HE STATED:
I BELIEVE THAT THE DEMAND FOR CITIZENSHIP IS JUST, AND THAT IT IS AMPLY EARNED BY SUSTAINED LOYALTY ON THE PART OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND.
BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE DEMAND MUST BE, AND IN THE MINDS OF MOST PUERTO RICANS IS, ENTIRELY DISASSOCIATED FROM ANY THOUGHT OF STATEHOOD...
I BELIEVE THAT THE AIM TO BE STRIVEN FOR IS THE FULLEST POSSIBLE ALLOWANCE OF LEGAL AND FISCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, WITH AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP AS THE BOND BETWEEN US; IN OTHER WORDS, A RELATION ANALOGOUS TO THE PRESENT RELATION BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND SUCH SELF-GOVERNING COLONIES AS CANADA AND AUSTRALIA.
THIS WOULD CONDUCE TO THE FULLEST AND MOST SELF-SUSTAINING DEVELOPMENT OF PUERTO RICO, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD GRANT HER ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL BENEFITS OF BEING UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG.
AS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT CONCEIVABLY COULD ARISE, BY GRANTING AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP, FELIX FRANKFURTER, WHEN HE WAS SERVING AT THE WAR DEPARTMENT, WROTE IN 1914 AND IS CITED IN THE CASE OF MORA V. TORRES, WAIVING ASIDE SHAM CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS: THE PRESENT DAY DEMANDS UPON INVENTIVE STATESMANSHIP TO HELP EVOLVE NEW KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS SO AS TO COMBINE THE ADVANTAGES OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT WITH THOSE OF A CONFEDERATED UNION.
LUCKILY, OUR CONSTITUTION HAS LEFT THIS FIELD OF INVENTION OPEN.
PUERTO RICANS UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR US CITIZENSHIP WAS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO INCORPORATE THEM, BUT A FUNDAMENTAL VEHICLE TO ACHIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS NECESSARY TO PROGRESS AS A SOCIETY.
THAT CITIZENSHIP REPRESENTS A POWERFUL BOND WITH THE UNITED STATES THAT PUERTO RICANS CHERISH AND AS SUCH IS RECOGNIZED IN THE COMMONWEALTH CONSTITUTION.
THE COMMONWEALTH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT HAS ALLOWED PUERTO RICANS TO ACHIEVE THEIR MOST BASIC ASPIRATIONS AS A PEOPLE.
AND THAT FREEDOM TO BE OURSELVES HAS ALLOWED US TO ACHIEVE A MIRACULOUS ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH.
WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY USING A POWERFUL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL: FISCAL AUTONOMY.
THIS TOOL ALLOWS US TO COLLECT OUR OWN TAXES AND SET OUR OWN FISCAL PRIORITIES, WHICH ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES.
OUR ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS HAVE GROWN STRONGER AND THE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED STATES.
PUERTO RICO IS TODAY THE #1 PER CAPITA CONSUMER OF US PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD; AND THE 9TH LARGEST MARKET FOR US GOODS IN THE WORLD.
IN 1999, PUERTO RICO PURCHASED $16 BILLION WORTH OF US PRODUCTS, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO OVER 320,000 JOBS IN THE MAINLAND U.S. PUERTO RICO PURCHASES MORE FROM THE REST OF THE U.S., THAN MUCH LARGER COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA, ITALY, RUSSIA AND BRAZIL.
THE COMMONWEALTH THIS BRIEF REVIEW IS RELEVANT BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS THE PARADOX OF PUERTO RICO.
ON THE ONE HAND OUR WILL TO PRESERVE AND PROMOTE OUR CULTURAL AND DISTINCT IDENTITY, AND ON THE OTHER, OUR DESIRE TO PRESERVE OUR US CITIZENSHIP IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UNITED STATES.
THAT WAS MY MAIN CONCLUSION BACK IN 1998 WHEN I CAME HERE.
AND THAT IS ALSO THE MAIN CONCLUSION OF THE MOST RECENT POLL PUBLISHED BY ONE OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE ISLAND, EL NUEVO DÃ¯Â¿Â½A.
IN THAT POLL, PUBLISHED ON MAY 2ND OF THIS YEAR, 60% RESPONDED THAT PUERTO RICO WAS THEIR NATION.
NEVERTHELESS 63% ALSO RESPONDED THAT U.S. CITIZENSHIP WAS IMPORTANT FOR THEM.
THE ONLY WAY OUT TO THIS APPARENT PARADOX IS COMMONWEALTH.
IT IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE OF STATUS THAT HARMONIZES THESE TWO CENTRAL ELEMENTS OF MY PEOPLES WILL.
AS WE REVISIT THE US-PUERTO RICO RELATIONSHIP, WE MUST BE WARY OF LABELS AND ABSTRACTIONS, AND FOCUS ON THE POLITICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL CONTEXT OF THE RELATIONSHIP.
TODAY WE LIVE IN A NEW WORLD, THE COLD WAR IS OVER AND WE FACE NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES.
TWO PARALLEL TRENDS CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER.
ON THE ONE HAND, THE RESURGENCE OF NATIONALISMS; ETHNIC GROUPS AND PEOPLES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE REAFFIRMING THEIR IDENTITY AND AUTONOMY: FROM CHECHNYA, TO BOSNIA, TO IRELAND TO PALESTINE AND ISRAEL.
THIS NATIONAL FORCE COULD BE A CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE AND SOMETIMES IT COULD BECOME DESTRUCTIVE, BUT IT IS AN UNDENIABLE SOCIOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL PHENOMENON.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS A CLEAR WORLD TREND OF OPENNESS OF TRADITIONAL FRONTIERS, FIRST ECONOMICALLY, AND THEN POLITICALLY.
ONCE THE NATIONS FEEL SECURE IN THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITY AND AFFIRMATION, THEY ARE WILLING TO INTEGRATE WITH OTHER NATION-STATES.
TAKE THE CASE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
THIS OPENNESS HAS BROUGHT A DEEP REVISION OF TRADITIONAL CONCEPTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND CITIZENSHIP.
THESE CONCEPTS HAVE BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTABLE TO THE NEW REALITIES OF THE GLOBAL WORLD.
IN THIS CONTEXT, I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMONWEALTH WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME.
THE COMMONWEALTH MODEL IS ONE OF VARIOUS AUTONOMOUS MODELS THAT HAVE PROVED TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
VARIOUS SCHOLARS, SUCH AS PROFESSOR HURST HANNUM, HAVE RECOGNIZED THE BENEFITS OF AN AUTONOMOUS ARRANGEMENT SUCH AS THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO.
HANNUM, AS OTHERS, HAVE ARGUED THAT THE COMMONWEALTH IS A LEGITIMATE STATUS UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, IN AS MUCH AS, IT REPRESENTS THE FREE WILL OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.
THE CURRENT DEADLOCK THE VIEW THAT COMMONWEALTH IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR THE ISLAND IS SHARED BY THE MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICANS.
STATEHOOD HAS NEVER BEEN FAVORED IN ANY PLEBISCITE ON STATUS.
INDEPENDENCE TODAY HAS LESS THAN 5% OF SUPPORT.
THE COMMONWEALTH WAS CHOSEN BY THE VOTERS IN 1952, AND IT HAS BEEN FAVORED IN EVERY PLEBISCITE SINCE, IN 1967, 1993 AND 1998.
THAT BEING SAID, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT SETTLED AND PUERTO RICANS ARE STILL DIVIDED.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE 1950-52 PROCESS, PUERTO RICO EXERCISED, BUT DID NOT EXHAUST ITS RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION.
IN OTHER WORDS, PUERTO RICO STILL PRESERVES ITS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION.
CONGRESS HAS NOT RESPONDED ON EVER REACTED TO ANY OF THE LOCAL REFERENDA HELD IN THE ISLAND AFTER 1952.
ALL THE ATTEMPTS TO ENHANCE COMMONWEALTH TOWARD A MORE AUTONOMOUS STATUS, THE UNFULFILLED AGENDA OF THE 1950S GENERATION, HAVE ALSO BEEN DISREGARDED.
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON STATUS IS NOT THE PROBLEM THAT IS PART OF OUR DEMOCRACY NEVERTHELESS, ALL ATTEMPTS TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF SELF-DETERMINATION INITIATED IN 1952 HAVE FAILED IN CONGRESS.
AND THERE IS A LESSON FROM OUR DEALINGS IN WASHINGTON.
OUR DIVISIONS IN THE ISLAND ARE TAKEN TO WASHINGTON WITH UNSURPRISING RESULTS NOTHING IS ACCOMPLISHED.
ALL PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE POLITICS OF BACKSTABBING AND MUTUAL SABOTAGE IN WASHINGTON.
THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE IS THE INFAMOUS STATEHOOD BILL OF 1997.
THIS BILL WAS PROMOTED BY THE STATEHOOD PARTY AND WAS NEGOTIATED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO EXCLUDE COMMONWEALTH AS A DEMOCRATIC OPTION.
THEY INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOBBYISTS AND IN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CONVINCE CONGRESS THAT PUERTO RICANS WANTED STATEHOOD AND THAT THE BILL WAS ABOUT SELF-DETERMINATION, WHEN IN REALITY IT WAS AN UNDEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT EXCLUDED THE CHOICE PREFERRED BY THE MAJORITY OF PUERTO RICO: THE COMMONWEALTH OPTION.
OF COURSE, THE EFFORT FAILED
.
THERE IS A LESSON THAT WE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED BY NOW: THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ACHIEVE ANY CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF THE US-PUERTO RICO RELATIONSHIP IS TO WORK TOGETHER, WITH OPEN DIALOGUE AND CONSENSUS.
ALL PARTIES AND ALL SECTORS MUST BE INCLUDED AND HAVE A VOICE IN ANY STATUS REVISION EFFORT.
LAST MONTH, IN A SPEECH AT HARVARD, I DISCUSSED TWO MAIN AREAS OF ENHANCEMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY THAT ITS FOUNDERS INTENDED FOR PUERTO RICO.
TODAY I WANT TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE PROCESS THAT MUST TAKE PLACE BEFORE ANY STATUS CHANGE IS PROPOSED IN WASHINGTON.
PRINCIPLES FOR A NEW CONSENSUS FIRST WE MUST AGREE ON A SET OF PRINCIPLES THAT IS NECESSARY FOR ACHIEVING THE NEW CONSENSUS.
I BELIEVE THAT PUERTO RICANS FROM ALL IDEOLOGIES SHOULD EMBRACE THESE PRINCIPLES.
1---FAIR TREATMENT FOR EACH ALTERNATIVE AND OPEN PARTICIPATION TO ALL PARTIES AND SECTORS OF SOCIETY.
THE FIRST PRINCIPLE FOR A NEW CONSENSUS IS THAT NO SERIOUS DISCUSSION OF STATUS CAN BE MADE WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL SECTORS OF THE PUERTO RICAN SOCIETY.
I MEAN NOT ONLY THE POLITICAL PARTIES, BUT ALSO THE CIVIL SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.
2-PROCEDURAL AGREEMENT.
SINCE THERE IS DISAGREEMENT AS TO THE SUBSTANTIVE SOLUTIONS OF STATUS, ALL PARTIES AND GROUPS MUST FIRST WORK TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROCEDURAL AGREEMENT TO EXERCISE OUR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION.
THIS AGREEMENT WOULD SET THE PROCEDURE THROUGH WHICH THE PEOPLE WILL OPENLY AND DEMOCRATICALLY EXPRESS THEIR WILL.
AMONG THE PROCEDURAL ALTERNATIVES TO BE CONSIDERED ARE, ANOTHER PLEBISCITE, AN AMERICAN-PUERTO RICAN COMMISSION ON STATUS AND A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION ON STATUS OR A COMBINATION OF THEM. 3- WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE IN WASHINGTON ONCE THERE IS A PROCEDURAL AGREEMENT IN PUERTO RICO WE SHOULD COME TO WASHINGTON WITH ONE VOICE.
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL GET A RESPONSE FROM CONGRESS.
VIEQUES IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT.
WHILE THIS PROCESS IS BEING DISCUSSED AND IMPLEMENTEDNO GROUP OR PARTY SHOULD COME TO WASHINGTON TO LOBBY, BEHIND THE BACK OF THE REST OF PUERTO RICO.
THE COMMISSION OF PUERTO RICAN UNITY: A VEHICLE FOR A NEW CONSENSUS UPON THOSE PRINCIPLES WE NEED TO CREATE A VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH WE CAN OPENLY DISCUSS THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO RESOLVE THE STATUS CONUNDRUM.
THIS VEHICLE IS THE COMMISSION OF PUERTO RICAN UNITY, AS PROPOSED BY GOVERNOR SILA M. CALDERÃ¯Â¿Â½N.
THIS PROPOSAL WAS INCLUDED IN THE POPULAR DEMOCRATIC PARTYS PLATFORM AND ACCEPTED BY THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS IN THE 2000 ELECTION.
THE COMMISSION OF PUERTO RICAN UNITY WILL BE THE VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH WE, AS A PEOPLE, WILL REACH A CONSENSUS ON A PROCEDURE TO EFFECTIVELY EXPRESS OUR WILL TO WASHINGTON.
THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMMISSION ARE ITS INCLUSIVENESS AND ADOPTION OF CONSENSUS AS THE WAY TO PROCEED.
THERE WILL BE REPRESENTATION OF EACH ONE OF THE THREE MAJOR PARTIES, THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER, 3 CITIZENS NOT MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF ANY OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND OF 2 RENOWNED PUERTO RICAN JURISTS.
THE FIVE MEMBERS THAT DO NOT REPRESENT THE POLITICAL PARTIES WILL BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE ISLAND.
THEREFORE, THE NEED FOR CONSENSUS IS THERE FROM THE BEGINNING.
THIS PROPOSAL IS TRULY REMARKABLE BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PUERTO RICOS RECENT HISTORY, THE PARTY IN POWER IS WILLING TO SHARE ITS POWER AND OPEN THE PROCESS, INSTEAD OF USING POWER TO ADVANCE JUST ONE STATUS ALTERNATIVE.
NO POLITICAL PARTY WILL HAVE THE MAJORITY IN THE COMMISSION.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNOR CALDERÃ¯Â¿Â½N, RECOGNIZES THAT THE POLITICAL PARTIES DO NOT AND SHOULD NOT MONOPOLIZE THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE ON STATUS IN PUERTO RICO.
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED CITIZENS THAT HAVE DEDICATED MOST OF THEIR LIVES TO ISSUES THAT AFFECT PUERTO RICAN SOCIETY, INCLUDING THE STATUS ISSUE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE STRUCTURE OF ANY OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES.
THESE CITIZENS HAVE A LOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION OF STATUS.
THIS OFFICIAL INCLUSION OF THE NON-PARTISAN ELEMENT OF OUR CIVIL SOCIETY, REPRESENT A RADICAL AND IMPORTANT DEPARTURE FROM THE TRADITIONAL PARTISAN MONOPOLY OF THE STATUS PROCESS.
ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMMISSION MUST BE COMMITTED TO RESPECT THE FREE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND TO RESPECT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
IN THIS SENSE THEY MUST ACCEPT TWO PREMISES: (1) THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO TO FREELY CHOSE THEIR FUTURE STATUS; AND (2) THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE FOR ANY OF THE ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY CHOSEN: COMMONWEALTH, STATEHOOD AND INDEPENDENCE.
WHAT IS THE AGENDA OF THE COMMISSION? TO REACH A CONSENSUS ON WHAT IS THE BEST AVAILABLE PROCESS OF SELF-DETERMINATION FOR PUERTO RICO TODAY.
THE NEED FOR A CONSENSUS IS EVIDENT.
AFTER THE 1950-52 PROCESS THAT CULMINATED WITH THE CREATION OF COMMONWEALTH, CONGRESS HAS NOT AUTHORIZED A NEW PROCESS OF SELF-DETERMINATION OR RESPONDED TO THE PLEBISCITES HELD IN THE ISLAND UNDER LOCAL LAW.
IF WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WE CANNOT REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST AND WE SHALL REPRODUCE THE MODEL THAT DID WORK, SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE, AS WE DID WITH VIEQUES.
THE COMMISSION WILL CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURAL ALTERNATIVES: THE CELEBRATION OF ANOTHER PLEBISCITE IN PUERTO RICO.
THE KIND OF PLEBISCITE, WILL BE A MATTER OF DISCUSSION FOR THE COMMISSION, AND WILL DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL CONTEXT OF THE MOMENT, IN PUERTO RICO AND IN WASHINGTON.
FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD BE A PLEBISCITO CRIOLLO OR LOCAL PLEBISCITE WITHOUT ANY INTERVENTION FROM CONGRESS; OR IT COULD BE, A FEDERAL PLEBISCITE ORDERED BY CONGRESS, BUT EVEN A FEDERAL PLEBISCITE MAY OR MAY NOT BE SELF-IMPLEMENTING.
IN ANY CASE, THE PLEBISCITE ROUTE HAS BEEN EXPLORED BEFORE AND WE MUST BE CAREFUL SO WE DO NOT REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST.
ANOTHER PROCEDURAL ROUTE CAN BE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A US-PUERTO RICO COMMISSION.
A JOINT COMMISSION MAY ALSO TAKE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES.
ONE APPROACH THAT THE PRESIDENT CREATES THE COMMISSION THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.
THIS IS THE APPROACH TAKEN WITH THE KENNEDY COMMISSION IN 1962.
THE PROBLEM WITH SUCH APPROACH IS THAT A COMMISSION MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN THE EXECUTIVE BRACH AND CONGRESS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO HEED THE COMMISSIONS REPORT.
ON THE OTHER HAND A US-PUERTO RICO COMMISSION MAY BE CREATED BY A FEDERAL LAW WITH A CLEAR MANDATE DELINEATED IN THE LEGISLATION.
IN ANY CASE, A PLEBISCITE WILL BE NECESSARY TO RATIFY ANY RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMISSION.
A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY ON STATUS IS YET ANOTHER PROCEDURAL CHOICE THAT THE COMMISSION OF PUERTO RICAN UNITY MAY SELECT.
AND AS THE OTHER PROCEDURAL ALTERNATIVES THAT I HAVE OUTLINED SO FAR, THIS ONE HAS VARIOUS MODALITIES.
ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT IT IS AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS, LIKE IT HAPPENED IN 1950-52.
ANOTHER IS TO DO IT LOCALLY AND THEN GO TO WASHINGTON WITH THE RESULTS.
AS YOU SEE, THE PROCEDURAL ALTERNATIVES ARE MANY.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT NO CHANGE WILL BE MADE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.
TODAY, I INVITE ALL POLITICAL PARTIES IN PUERTO RICO AND ALL SECTORS OF OUR SOCIETY TO JOIN THIS PROCESS WHEN GOVERNOR CALDERON OFFICIALLY CALLS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION OF PUERTO RICAN UNITY.
LETS ALL COME TO THE TABLE.
LETS WORK OPENLY-NOT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS--SO THAT OUR PEOPLE CAN SEE, AND SO THE US CAN SEE, WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ALL ABOUT.
IT IS TIME TO LEARN FROM HISTORY.
ONLY THE UNITED VOICE OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO WILL FORCE THE RESPONSE WE NEED FROM CONGRESS.
THE FUTURE OF PUERTO RICO IS IN OUR HANDS.
OUR GENERATION HAS A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTINUE THE UNFULFILLED AGENDA TO ACHIEVE FULL SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE.
TO COMPLETE THIS UNFULFILLED AGENDA, WE MUST OVERCOME THE KIND OF PARTISAN TRIBALISM THAT HAS IMPAIRED OUR CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESS THAT BEGAN IN 1952.
MY INVITATION TO ALL WHO LOVE PUERTO RICO IS THIS: LETS WORK TOGETHER TOWARD A NEW CONSENSUS.
WE OWE IT TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF OUR BELOVED PUERTO RICO.
THANK YOU.
