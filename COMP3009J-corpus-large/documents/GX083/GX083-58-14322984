Introduction _____________________
...a constructed wetland system can be a cost efficient and environmentally sound wastewater treatment solution.

The constructed wetland system is the cornerstone of Arcata's urban watershed renovation program.
This program includes major urban stream restoration, log pond conversion to a swamp habitat, pocket wetlands on critical reaches of urban streams, and an anadramous wastewater aquaculture program to restore critical commercial recreational and ecological important populations.
The Arcata project is a demonstration of wastewater reuse, ecological restoration, and reuse of industrial, agricultural and public service land.
Arcata Site Plan
Situated in the heart of the redwood country and along the rocky shores of the Pacific Northcoast, the City of Arcata is located on the northeast shore of Humboldt Bay in Northern California, 280 miles north of San Francisco.
Arcata, with a population of approximately 15,000, is a diverse community whose resourcefulness and integrity has demonstrated that a constructed wetland system can be a cost efficient and environmentally sound wastewater treatment solution.
In addition to effectively fulfilling wastewater treatment needs, Arcata's innovative wetland system has provided an inspiring bay view window to the benefits of integrated wetland enhancement and wastewater treatment.

What is the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary?
Arcata is a small town located on the north-eastern side of Humboldt Bay, about 280 miles north of San Francisco.
Humboldt Bay is a focal point where timber resources and marine resources cross paths as they struggle to sustain Humboldt County's economy.
Resource management is a practice that receives high priority and expert advice in this scenic niche of the Pacific Northcoast.
Arcata, with a population of approximately 15,000, is a diverse community whose resourcefulness and integrity has served to lead the city down a successful path marked by innovative decisions and maintained by pride.
So, when the city faced making a change in their wastewater treatment methods, they demonstrated that a constructed wetland system can be a cost efficient and environmentally sound wastewater treatment solution.
In addition to effectively fulfilling wastewater treatment needs, Arcata's innovative wetland system has provided an inspiring bay view window to the benefits of integrated wetland enhancement and wastewater treatment.
How did the project evolve?

In the early 1970's, Arcata's active wastewater treatment plant discharged unchlorinated primary effluent into Humboldt Bay.
In 1974 the State of California enacted a policy which prohibited discharge of wastewater into bays and estuaries unless enhancement of the receiving water was proven.
In response to this policy the local Humboldt Bay Wastewater Authority proposed the construction of a state sponsored regional wastewater treatment plant that would serve all the communities in the Humboldt Bay vicinity.
The plant was to have large interceptors around the perimeter of the bay with a major line crossing under the bay in the region of active navigation.
The proposed treatment facility was energy intensive, with significant operational requirements.
Effluent from the proposed plant was to be released offshore into an area of shifting sea bottom and heavy seas during winter storms.
As the scale of the regional treatment plant grew, the costs and difficulties of incorporating other communities became apparent _____________________

Recognizing the constraints of the local environment and criteria for wastewater treatment, the City of Arcata began exploring the design of a decentralized system which employed constructed wetlands.
Wastewater aquaculture projects at the City of Arcata started as early as 1969 and had been successful in raising juvenile Pacific Salmon and Trout in mixtures of partially treated wastewater and seawater.
This project demonstrated that wastewater was a "resource" that could be reused and not simply to be viewed as a disposal problem.
With this philosophy a city Task Force on Wastewater Treatment determined that the natural processes of a constructed wetland system could offer the city an effective and efficient wastewater treatment system.
From 1979 to 1982 the city, and associated proponents of alternative wastewater treatment, experimented with partially treated wastewater and the natural processes of wetland ecosystems.
These experiments demonstrated that constructed freshwater wetlands could be utilized to treat Arcata's wastewater and at the same time enhance the biological productivity of the wetland environment into which treated wastewater was discharged.
The Task Force determined that a constructed wetland system was extremely cost effective.
Moreover, a successful system offers the city a vital wetland ecosystem that could be used for the rearing of salmon and steelhead as well as offer the community a unique site for recreation and education.
With the aid of the Arcata City Council and political representatives in the state capital, the city received authorization in 1983 to develop the constructed wetland system and incorporate its use at the original Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The wetland system that exists today was completed in 1986.
Since that time the natural ability of marsh plants, soils and their associated microorganisms has successfully been utilized to meet the need for a cost-effective and environmentally sound wastewater treatment technology that meets federal and state mandated water quality requirements.
Who cares and what are the benefits?

At the same time that wetland wastewater technology has been used to successfully meet water quality criteria, it has also aided in restoring a degraded urban waterfront.
Prior to the installation of its wetland treatment system, the City of Arcata's waterfront was the site of an abandoned lumbermill pond, channelized sloughs, marginal pasture lands, and a closed sanitary landfill.
Today, Arcata's waterfront has been transformed into 100 acres of freshwater and saltwater marshes, brackish ponds, tidal sloughs and estuaries.
Because of the wetland communities and wildlife habitats that the waterfront now supports, the area in its entirety has come to be known as the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary (AMWS.)
The AMWS's three freshwater wetlands are Gearheart, Allen and Hauser Marshes.
They were constructed to receive treated wastewater, thereby treating the wastewater further and enhancing the receiving water at the same time.
These enhancement marshes are a host of aquatic vegetation that, in association with Klopp Lake and the adjacent estuaries and ponds, have further provided an extraordinary habitat for shorebirds, waterfowl, raptors and migratory birds.
As a home or rest stop for over 200 species of birds, the AMWS has developed a reputation as one of the best birding sites along the Pacific North Coast.
The Redwood Region Audubon Society uses the site on a regular basis for its weekly nature walks.
For the past 10 years, docents trained by the Society have explained the role the wetlands play in attracting birds and mammals, as well a s their role in managing the water quality of Humboldt Bay.
The beauty and uniqueness of the AMWS has served as inspiration to many artists, whose products range in form from plays and poems to photographs and paintings.
Arcata has become an international model of appropriate and successful wastewater reuse and wetland enhancement technologies.
Over 150,000 people a year use the AMWS for passive recreation, bird-watching, or scientific study.
Visitors from around the world have come to Arcata to investigate its success in wastewater management.
Students of all ages and institutions use the AMWS for scientific study.
In 1987, the City of Arcata was selected by the Ford Foundation to receive an award for this wastewater wetlands project as an innovative local government project.
This award included a $100,000 prize to be used to fund the establishment of the Arcata Marsh Interpretive Center.
The Center focuses on the historical, biological and technical aspects of the AMWS, and attempts to meet the informational and educational demands of the wastewater treatment system.
