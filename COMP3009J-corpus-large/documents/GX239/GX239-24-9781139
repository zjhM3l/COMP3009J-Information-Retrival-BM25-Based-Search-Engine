The Update is intended as a vehicle for communicating the current status of field work related to the investigation of malformed frogs in Minnesota.
Readers include land owners around study sites, county water staff, and anyone else who is involved or interested in the progress of this work.
May 1999
Spring is finally here, and the frogs are reminding us of that fact with their wonderful breeding calls.
If you have a chance, take a walk outside near a pond and listen.
You will be amazed at the sounds these small animals can produce.
These sounds of spring are our alarm clock for our frog team, letting us know it's time to start the field season.
We are already in the field, even though the weather has not been cooperating.
We are continuing to work on the malformed frog investigation with a wide network of scientists.
This year, the malformed frog investigation has focused on locating egg masses in early spring and finding the very young larvae (tadpoles).
Our partners at the United States Geological Survey (USGS), National Wildlife Health Center, and scientists at the University of Wisconsin are examining these early larvae to learn how their development is disturbed.
We are also conducting surveys of larvae and juvenile frogs at several sites to document malformations and growth rates.
In addition, we are having researchers look at the blood, gonads and larynx of frogs to determine if there is any evidence of hormonal disruption.
The theory of endocrine disruption (the endocrine system uses hormone "signals" to regulate development in animals and humans) holds that some chemicals in the environment are interfering with normal reproduction and development in some animal species.
This is evidenced by recently well-publicized findings such as male fish making a female lipoprotein, alligators with stunted sexual organs, and many other endocrine abnormalities in the animal world.
In some cases these developments have been shown to cause lower reproductive rates in the animal populations thus affected.
We don't know if malformations in frogs are caused by endocrine disrupters.
In addition to the frog work in the field and lab, USGS and MPCA hydrologists are continuing to define the interaction of ground and surface water at our study sites to see how it may affect the frogs' habitat.
We are also planning to have a scientist from the USGS in Missouri come to measure ultraviolet light levels at the sites, to try to get a handle on whether changes in UV levels may have something to do with the problem.
Also, as in the past, water and sediment analysis will be conducted from sites during the 1999 field season.
As results come in, we will try to keep you up to date.
The work is going forward on several levels.
You may have seen national news reports lately which seemed to claim that parasites are now proven to be "The Cause" for malformed frogs.
There has been one recent study showing that parasites can cause malformations in tree frogs in one location in California.
In Minnesota we have looked at parasites as a potential cause all along, and experts with whom we work have not seen any significant association between parasites and malformed frogs.
In addition, a common parasite found in Minnesota frogs has been shown not to cause malformations.
We are continuing to pursue many possible causes, so as not to miss anything.
As research continues into the year 2000, we hope to start looking at additional possible factors such as air deposition, snow melt and spring runoff.
As we have done in the past two years, we are again documenting any amphibian malformations seen in Minnesota with the help of Hamline University's "Thousand Friends of Frogs" program.
If you see any malformed frogs while you're out and about this spring and summer, please make note of information such as type of frog (leopard, wood, green, etc.), size, where found (county/city), date found, describe malformation, and how many frogs you looked at.
Then please call at Hamline's Frog Hotline, at (612) 523-2812 or (800) 888-2182, with this information.
They share the information with us regularly.
If you find that frogs in your area are just fine and appear to have no abnormalities, that's also good information for us to know, and we'd appreciate it if you would report that to the Thousand Friends as well.
I will continue to keep you up-to-date on the Minnesota malformed frog investigation.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me any time at the address below.
Until next time, enjoy the frogs and the beautiful outdoors surrounding you!!

New Findings Link Water to Frog Malformations in Minnesota
At a press conference in St. Paul on September 30, 1997, staff of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) discussed information on a recent study of the water from two wetland sites in Minnesota where high numbers of deformed frogs have been found in the last two years.
The sites, both in the northwestern part of the state, have been studied the past two summers by researchers from the MPCA and the University of Minnesota.
At one of the sites, researchers have at different times in the season found a high proportion of frogs with missing or contorted limbs and other abnormalities.
Water from two sites was provided to NIEHS scientists from whom the MPCA had requested help with the frogs investigation last winter.
Using a lab test called a FETAX assay, an NIEHS laboratory grew the embryos of the Xenopus frog species (African clawed frog) in water from the two sites.
The test, which takes four days to complete, was run multiple times using dilutions of the water from the Minnesota sites ranging from zero to 100 percent.
At concentrations above 50 percent, a high percentage of the frog embryos developed in the water showed a wide range of abnormalities, similar to what has been observed in frog larvae in the field in Minnesota since 1995.
Moreover, the number of abnormalities increased with the concentration of the water from Minnesota sites.
Water from "normal" sites (no deformed frogs found) did not produce harmful effects in the frogs.
According to NIEHS staff, these results strongly indicate that something in the water, at least at these two sites, can cause these abnormalities in the lab.
Still unknown is what the harmful agent may be and whether these findings will be seen at other sites where high numbers of deformed frogs have been found.
The FETAX test also gave positive results using both surface water and ground water from the sites, including tap water from private wells used by the closest residence to each site.
Residents at the sites have been advised of the findings and have been offered the option for the state to provide them with bottled water as a precaution until more is known.
MPCA Commissioner Peder Larson said, "These findings give us a big piece of the puzzle we've been looking for in regard to the problems with the frogs.
It does not provide evidence of a human health link, but it does underline the need to look more closely at what all this may mean for the environment.
If the frog investigation was a priority for us before, it's even more so now."
Dr. George Lucier, Director of the Environmental Toxicology Program of the NIEHS, emphasized that NIEHS is working hard with the MPCA to determine the significance of these findings to human health.
He said that "we know that something in the water, including groundwater, is extraordinarily potent in malforming frogs, we now need to determine if people are at risk.
The causative agent or agents could be chemical contaminants or natural products such as pond plants or algae."
Larson also congratulated the NIEHS for their work, and praised the partnership the two agencies have developed to work on the problem.
"This is really a significant finding, and we're extremely grateful for their participation," he said.
"Working together with them has helped us do much more than we could have otherwise."
"The NIEHS is widely recognized as the premier toxicology research center in the world with outstanding laboratory resources that a state government could make use of under appropriate circumstances, Kenneth Olden, Ph.D., NIEHS Director said.
"So this situation is an ideal opportunity to apply our science to a serious public health concern, in partnership with state government."
Staff of the two agencies discussed plans for further work at the press conference, including collecting more samples from these and other study sites around the state, conducting studies on water from additional sites where significant numbers of deformed frogs have been found, and determining the identity of the causative agent or agents.
Of critical importance will be to determine if the water from other sites appears to have the same properties, whether ground water at other sites is similarly affected, and what the human health implications of these findings may be.
This story has captured the attention of many people around the world.
The MPCA continues to get many calls about what's happening with the frogs.
People are very much concerned about the problem.
