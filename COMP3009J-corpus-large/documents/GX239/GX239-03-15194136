MR. STEVENSON:
My name is Hugh Stevenson
from the FTC, thank you all very much for coming today to our workshop on identity theft.
Here to
welcome you is the distinguished director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, Jodie Bernstein.
MS. BERNSTEIN: And thank all of you.
(Applause.)
MS. BERNSTEIN: Thank you so much.
Let me Thank you very much, Hugh.
reciprocate by thanking all of you for coming to our workshop today.
I know that it's going to be a very I will only take a few minutes
productive session.
to talk with you about it and then we'll get busy, because we have a very, very full agenda for both days, and we look forward to it.
You may all recall that at the Treasury Summit on Identity Theft in March, we all agreed that this was a serious issue, and to further our discussion and debate toward bringing some light on this subject, we identified three issues for further scrutiny.
As you all recall, I think they were For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025

Our
workshop today is going to focus on the latter, that is victim assistance.
And to update you on the other events for a moment, the Social Security Administration will convene its workshop on prevention this Wednesday, October 25th, and that will be held across the mall at the Department of Health and Human Services.
The
Department of Justice, the Secret Service, will host a workshop for law enforcement on December 6th on investigation and prosecution.
But the goal of today's workshop is to examine the problems victims experience with trying to restore their good name to financial health.
to explore the concrete steps we can take to make the process less burdensome.
In particular, in And
particular, we hope to make progress on two initiatives that were raised at the Treasury Summit, and I must say have been raised in other fora as well.
In fact, one of them has been incorporated
into legislature proposals introduced on Capitol Hill this session, and depending on what kind of progress we all make, probably will come back again.
The first is one we've come to call one-stop shop, a process by which a consumers call to any one For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 of the three major consumer reporting agencies, or to the IDT hotline, will result in placing a fraud alert on the consumer file and all three consumer reporting agencies.
The second initiative is a
standard fraud declaration report identity theft activity to the bank, creditors, debt collectors or other entities involved.
Rather than filling out a
separate fraud packet for each of the institutions involved, the victim would fill out the standard fraud declaration once and send signed copies to each of the companies involved.
Both of those issues have arisen, as I said, at the Treasury Summit, and both have been discussed in -- on Capitol Hill, and in other fora as well.
I'm very optimistic and think that if we can make progress on those two issues, as we work together through these two days, we will have accomplished a great deal.
Each and every one of you deserve kudos, and I would like to give them to you today, for being here with us to work through these issues.
Especially the financial institutions.
We know that
your role in restoring a victim's good name is very complicated.
And if you hear some minor criticism,
not by name, but in regard to your institutions, we For The Record, Inc.

The main thing is, though, that you're here and you're indicating your willingness to work with us, and with all the groups that are involved here, and we really do thank you for that.
Similarly, I
would like to thank the law enforcement people who are here today, they're all stretched thin.
We are,
as well, but again, it's something that's necessary for all of us to work together.
We haven't always
in the past, and we intend to further that goal as well.
The consumer advocates and private attorneys that are here today, similarly I would like to mention, again, because this involves so many different parties and so many different interests, that without the full participation of all of you, we would not make as much progress as I think we are capable of doing today.
So, I know it's a sacrifice for all of you to be here to spend the time with us, but I think it will more than justify it if we achieve what we're setting out to do today.

The Identity
Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of '98 directed the FTC to establish a decentralized victim complaint consumer service for victims.
We
established a consumer complaint hotline for victims of identity theft and a centralized national data clearinghouse to share the complaint information equally.
And many of the -- much of the trend data
and other collections will be described to you and some are in your materials today.
itself should prove very helpful.
As you know, we also enforce a number of consumer credit laws, some of which touch on the issues that we're involved in today, but law enforcement certainly has its place, however we are not focusing on that today, but rather on cooperative efforts to begin to resolve the number of issues that we're trying to get through.
We have a number of distinguished panelists participating in the sessions today and tomorrow.
Today's panels will principally focus on the inaccuracies from the victim's credit history and credit accounts.
Tomorrow we will focus on other That is the hardest I think that in
forms of identity theft.

Maybe we need to come up with a different If anybody does, I'll give them a T-shirt
that says you reconstructed identity theft and did us all a favor.
Tomorrow's will be the one that the hotline is hearing with greater frequency, that is criminal records, and bankruptcy records in the victim's name.
The first panel today is the victim's panel.
We will begin, however, with a presentation from our data clearinghouse.
Then we'll hear from the
victims because that's where the workshop issues all begin.
We're fortunate to have victims here today
who have been willing to travel from all over the country to share their experiences with us.
That first-hand experience, I think will help us better understand what actually happens to victims and what victims think could happen and could be improved in the process of clearing up their problems.
Once again, thanks to all of you for coming, for participating, and with that, let's get on with the first panel, thank you very much.
(Applause.)
MR. STEVENSON: Okay, I would ask the

As
Jodie mentioned, we're starting with the victim's panel, hearing from the victims first hand what kinds of problems they have encountered here.
And
moderating this panel are Joanna Crane, Joanna Crane is the program manager for our identity theft program, and we're also very glad to have today as a moderator Mari Frank, who is a private attorney who is I think well known to many of you as someone who has been involved for some time in identity theft issues.
Before the panel gets started, though, Joanna is going to -- before we hear from the victims here, Joanna is going to tell us in a bigger picture sense what we have heard from victims since our hotline and identity theft clearinghouse started operation back in November when we started accepting calls at 1-877-IDTHEFT, something we want to repeat a few times here, 877-IDTHEFT.
And we've had the
data since November, and for those in the overflow rooms, you can follow along, if you can't see on the screen with Joanna, in the book that is part of the package that you got today.
Joanna? For The Record, Inc.

CRANE: my program here.
Thank you.
I just want to start
I'm sorry to have to ask all of
you to sort of look over your shoulders to be able to follow along with the sites that I will be discussing.
They are also in, as Hugh mentioned,
the report that we've included in your packet.
As Hugh mentioned, we launched our identity theft data clearinghouse in November of '99, and the data that we have to show you today goes through September 30th, so that's 11 months of data.
And so
it's beginning to give us a fairly reliable picture of what's happening in the sort of macro sense of identity theft nationwide.
Most of the folks -- I should back up. hotline is a consumer complaint hotline, and the data in our database is consumer complaint information, it's not from law enforcement, and so we have to understand that this is as victims understand the situation.
We don't have an It is Our

solely consumer complaints as we collect them.
What we've learned about identity theft, though, I think is very interesting.
If you look at
it on a nation-wide basis, you can see that the largest number of identity theft complaints are For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 coming from the largest states, California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and Michigan.
However, when you look at it on a per capita basis, it breaks up somewhat differently.
We see that the
highest concentration of per capita is spread throughout the west coast, also, Florida, Maryland, District of Columbia, and -- did I say Maryland and the District of Columbia.
When you look at it
broken down to a city level basis, actually the highest ranking city is the District of Columbia.
We didn't have it on this chart because we're thinking of it more as a state, we like to think of DC statehood, but it is also a city, and it leads all the other cities with a rate of 19.6 per 100,000, then in ranking order it would be Houston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
When victims call us, they give us information that allows us to understand demographically what's going on.
Many times they
provide their age and thus far we have about 60 percent of the victims providing their age.
What it
shows us is the average age of consumers calling our hotline is 41 years of age.
However, the most
commonly reported age was 30 years, that's the mode I guess you call it.
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 People age 65 and over, while they represent 12 percent of the U.S. population, they only represent seven percent of individuals calling our hotline.
We're going to watch this relationship.
We want to understand whether it means that people age 65 and older are less likely to experience identity theft or whether it means that they are simply less likely to call our hotline, whether there's an outreach effort there that we need to really focus attention on.
On the other side, people age 18 and under represent 26 percent of the U.S. population, but only two percent of our victims.
Well, I guess this
makes sense that many of them are involved in setting up credit, so this number seems quite logical to us.
What's happening to these people? they experiencing? What are
Well, when you look at it purely
in terms of what types of identity theft they've experienced, it's remained pretty consistent since we began collecting the data that by far and away the most common type of identity theft they've experienced is credit card fraud.
report that.
Over 50 percent
Of that 50 percent, about three
quarters are new credit cards established in your For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 name.
Only about one quarter are people accessing
their current accounts and putting unauthorized charges on them.
We were surprised to learn that unauthorized phone and outservices are also a very, very common form of identity theft.
27 percent of the Of
complainants report this sort of identify theft.
this, about 40 percent is new phone service, about 35 percent is new wireless service, and about 13 percent is new utility service.
So, between phone
and wireless, there isn't a great deal of difference, and in general, this is new service, not people tapping into the existing service.
We see that bank fraud comes in third at 17 percent, with about 50 percent affecting the existing accounts of the victims, about 35 percent would be new accounts of the victims, and another 20 percent would be electronic fund transfer activity.
Fraudulent loans provides about 11 percent of the identity theft that we care about -- well, 11 percent of the victims who report to us report on fraudulent loans.
I should back up and say most of
our victims have experienced more than one type of fraud, so if you total over 100 percent, because we're going to get people reporting to various For The Record, Inc.

With fraudulent loans, it's about 50 percent business and personal, about 30 percent auto loans and about 10 percent real estate and mortgage type activity.
About eight percent of the people complain or let us know that a government document or benefit was forged or obtained in their name.
this is a driver's license.
Most often
About 55 percent of the
complainants let us know that someone either forged or obtained a driver's license in their name.
About
13 percent report that a social security card was forged or issued and used in their name.
About 12
percent report that someone has filed a fraudulent tax return in their name, which is enormously complicated to undo, I should say.
Other types of identity theft that you see there, 20 percent of the people who are letting us know that identity theft doesn't fall into one of our major categories, complain that someone has undertaken employment in their name.
There are
consequences such as tax consequences and social security consequences associated with that victim.
Eleven percent of our complainants tell us that someone has committed a criminal act and there is For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 now a false criminal record in their name.
About
eight percent of the complainants let us know that people have claimed emergency type medical services in their name and have left them with a bill to pay.
What do I know about what happened to them? About 60 percent of the callers know something about the suspect, they have either gotten bills or they may, in fact, know the suspect.
So, 60 percent are
able to provide some information about the suspect.
However, only 14 percent can readily identify the suspect as someone with whom they had a relationship.
In 86 percent of the cases, they only
know through some sort of document trail something about the suspect, and that, of course, is the vast majority.
If they do have information on the suspect, how often do they have a relationship? Well, again,
78 percent of those, there was no relationship, but where there is a relationship, it's most often with a family member, or someone with whom they've been very close in the past.

fairly small numbers.
Where do the suspects come from? have a slide on this, but I thought it was For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025 I don't It can also be workplace But again, those are

The top ten list of cities that people
identified their suspects coming from are Los Angeles, Brooklyn, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, Houston, the Bronx, Philadelphia, Atlanta and the District of Columbia.
Do the victims know much about how the suspect got their information? The answer is no.
I
think this is primarily because unless it's with someone with whom you have a relationship or you can actually see what's happened, as you see here, if they do know, it's most likely going to be something that was personal to them, either it was a wallet or purse lost or stolen, or mail bag, something that you can see that affects you in daily life.
the vast majority of cases where it's more sophisticated means, such as credit card scheming or computer texting or hacking, they have no idea.
Which means that 79 percent of the victims overall really have no idea how this has happened to them.
Of those who do, again, it's a wallet or purse lost or stolen, mail theft, perhaps they just applied for a loan or a credit card and they thought that was compromised, their employment records were compromised, or someone broke into their house.
But But in
it's one of the difficulties in resolving identity For The Record, Inc.

In fact, we found that over the average number of months that elapse between the date it occurred and the date the victim found out is 15 months, which I think jives pretty well with the study done by Cowper, which is again the privacy rights clearinghouse.
We find that there are many
victims who don't discover it for over five years.
Now, we do see that 30 percent discover it in less than one month, and those are the fortunate few, but again, the average is 15 months and it stretches up to over 60 months.
One of the things we try and do here at the Federal Trade Commission when a victim calls is let them know what steps they need to take.
We have
found, we wanted to validate that this was a worthy process for us to go through, and I don't have a slide on this, but we have found that at the time of initially filing their complaint, only 43 percent of complainants had notified all of the three major credit bureaus.
So, there are more than half the
people had not known to take that step and had not yet taken that step when they called our hotline, so we are glad we're reaching those people with this For The Record, Inc.

Of the 33 percent, we found that almost 100 percent, about 93 percent of those folks did place the fraud alert, so once they got ahold of the fraud reporting agency, things went well based on that report.
As far as the financial institution contact, we advised consumers when they call us to call each of the creditors and to put their dispute in writing.
Fifty percent of the complainants reported
that they had notified the financial institutions before they called us.
However, of these, only 29
percent of victims overall had sent written notifications to the institution.
So, again, I think we're providing a valuable service by letting consumers know that they just don't need to call the financial institutions, but to follow up in writing.
And lastly, contacting the police.
How many
of the consumers who had called us had already notified their local police department? percent.
Fifty-nine
That's good, but still there's 40 percent
out there that we're getting the message to very late about that.
Interestingly, we found that if
they had already notified the police, a good 36 For The Record, Inc.

That should be 100 percent.
If you notify
the police, you should walk away with a police report.
We're hoping that with the hard work being
done by the IACP and other law enforcement organizations that will become a reality.
Well, that's all I wanted to say today, because I do think the victims themselves through their experience will be able to tell us how it actually impacts them in their daily lives, but this is just a big overview from our database that I hope has been informative.
Mari, do you want to take it
from here while I shut this down? MS.
FRANK: introduce everybody.
If I could just ask that we We want to welcome you here
this morning, and I especially want to say thank you to the victims for coming and sharing your story, because you've already experienced so much invasion of your privacy, and it's really something for you to be able to share this story and help yourself and other people to make a difference.

FRANK: Sure, I would be happy to.
And then I will take over.
Because I want to make sure that we know who everybody is on the panel.

CRANE: We have brought folks who are
victims of identity theft from all over the country to be with us here today.
Starting on my far right,
is Joe Genera, here from Connecticut, Robert Greer, here from New Hampshire, Mari, of course, and myself.
Oh, I want to mention Mari is here from
California and is also a victim of identity theft, as well as being a professional counselor and attorney who works with clients who have experienced identity theft.
Deborah North is here from
Maryland, Nicole Robinson, also from Maryland, Eric Graves from California, and Kathleen Lund, who works here at the Federal Trade Commission as an investigative assistant and has spoken to thousands For The Record, Inc.

MS.
FRANK: Okay.
You know, there's three
reasons why someone would commit identity theft.
Joanna talked a lot about the financial industry in that someone will steal an identity for financial gain, or to become a legal citizen, or to get health care services, or to forestall that a foreclosure by committing, you know, filing bankruptcy, or they'll do a variety of things to get financial gain.
Now, the second reason that someone might commit identity theft is to avoid prosecution, and we have right here someone that's going to talk about that on the panel.
And the third reason that someone would commit identity theft is for retribution or they want to get back at someone, such as an ex-spouse will hire somebody to commit identity theft against their spouse, or a CEO will find that someone in the -- in his company has stolen his identity and perhaps sold it to someone else to ruin his identity.
So, that's the third one.
And I don't
know if we're going to have anybody talk about that one, but that's becoming an issue.

And once you
experience identity theft as I have and as all these people have, it is a nightmare that takes hundreds of hours.
And one of the things I hope that you'll consider as we listen today to some of the issues that need to be accomplished, especially with regard to the standard form that would be sent out, please remember that as victims, we have already lost our identity, and what has happened is, that the imposter has been able to get credit and other services with very little information that they had to provide, yet when we have to prove who we are, we give our whole life away.
And on the form that you're going to consider today and tomorrow, please consider that there's information there that's going to be disseminated to the entire world, and you might want to consider limiting that and safeguarding that information, because we've already given our whole lives away.
So, I know the people here have really experienced a nightmare, in just trying to prove who they are.

when your chairman of the Federal Trade Commission got up in March and said that he was a victim of identity theft.
And someone who is as careful as I
am, I became a victim again in July, a victim of skimming.
And so each one of us, this is not about
quote the victim out there, this is about each one of us.
And also the financial industry, you're victims, too.
I mean, your companies are victims.
You've lost money, you spend thousands of extra dollars on hiring new personnel to help you in your fraud department and for your credit reporting agency.
So, all of us here are victims, and when
you hear the challenges, what we're going to be doing is the victims are going to be able to share some of their greatest challenges and then we're going to go over their suggestions.
Please remember, like Jodie was saying, don't take it personally, take it as food for thought and for information so we can solve For The Record, Inc.

We're not here to say you're the bad
guys, we're here to say look, guys, we've got a problem, you're victims, we're victims, how can we make this work better for all of us.
I see Werner
Raes out there and I know that the law enforcement agencies are overwhelmed with not enough resources.
I see, you know, Diane Terry, from the credit reporting agencies, working as hard as she can, and yet it's overwhelming.
And so all of us here should
be working together and doing hopefully what I call solutioneering.
We have brainstormed a number of solutions, and these are out on the table out there, if you haven't picked one up.
These are just a few of
them, and Joanna had to cut some of mine, because I had more pages, but we have a lot of suggestions.
Now, if you say oh, this will never work, take it in stride and say well, this won't work, but this might work.
So, we're looking to try and find
ways that the victims can be -- that we as victims can be helped, that we as citizens can be helped, and that law enforcement and all of us can be helped together.
So, what's going to happen is, Joanna is now going to ask each of the victims to provide, tell us For The Record, Inc.

And as Mari mentioned, I'm going to sort of asking the victims a series of questions in three areas.
First is basically how they discovered it.
So,
Secondly, we're going to talk about what was the response of the various entities they had to go to when they initially reported the fraud.
This is,
you know, when they made those first phone calls.

experiences, Mari will be soliciting suggestions on For The Record, Inc.

I guess it seems fair, again, to start on my far right, with Eric Graves.
Excuse me, Joe Genera.
Joe, would you be able to tell us now how you all came to first discover that you were victims of identity theft? MR. GENERA: It began in 1998.
My fiance at
the time, who is now my wife, went to buy a car from a car dealership.
And I get a call at home that
day, after they check her credit report, and according to Kathleen, she has one credit card account, one ready credit account for $500, and an existing car loan.
So, we figured she has a great
job, great credit history, car loan is going to be no problem.
The dealer calls our home, talks to me, and says Joe, we want to sell her this car, we would love to see her in it, she has too much credit.
I said well, what do you mean, too much credit? Well, she has 16 credit cards.
I said 16? He goes So, I And
yeah, and he starts going through the list.

In any
case, it turns out that two people related to her through all those free offers of credit, those preapproved offers of credit we all get in the mail, had decided to intercept those at her home, fill out the credit applications using her social security number, sending them back in.
Those companies
offering all this great free credit, don't ask any identifying information whatsoever, no social security -- I mean no picture ID, nothing, it comes in the mail, you sign it, send it back.
They have
no way of knowing who the person is that filled out that form.
As it turned out, and now with fees, et cetera, it's in excess of $50,000 has been charged just through that -- just through that method.
Whether or not -- whether or not additional credit had been obtained as far as we believe it also occurred at department stores and things like that, they generally seem to be the easiest ones to get credit from.
That's how we found out.
And you want
to talk about a heck of a surprise.

that credit report, which you would assume would just have, you know, the two credit accounts, nine pages long.

you were a victim of identity theft? MR. GRAVES: Well, actually, it was my son.
He was applying
He was 19, this was also in 1998.
for a credit card -- not credit card, for a used car loan, and it turned out that he got turned down, it was Lockheed Federal Credit Union that turned him down.
And at that point then we started investigating his credit, got a list of the three credit agencies, got reports from them, all of which have different ways of reporting it.
It was like
trying to figure out a new legend for each report.
And it was just brand new to us how to attempt to try to confront the situation.
He didn't get the
car loan, obviously, but we've taken two years to try to clear his ID of two different addresses, one in Sandy Springs, Georgia, we're from LA, a water and power bill that wasn't paid, and also bankruptcy, someone had gotten his name and his social security number, and claimed bankruptcy under his name.
And he is 19 years old.
He hadn't lived
anywhere else but our house.

The first people we
contacted was over the Internet, the OIG Hotline and the three credit reporting agencies, but we really didn't get any sense of here's the procedure you should do, and it was very frustrating to try to know where to go first, and it all mushroomed from there.
MS.
CRANE: Thank you.
Robert, what about
you, how did you first discover that you were a victim of identity theft? MR. GREER: My cases had a few different
aspects, and every time something new comes up, I find out about it through a different means.
The first time it happened, I got a phone call from a fraud investigator at a bank in South Dakota, I'm a New Hampshire resident, it was very unusual.
She asked me a series of identity
questions, which I answered, and she told me what was going on.
And a clerk at a retail store whom
this bank handles, as the account, noticed that the ID used was a fraudulent ID.
So, they contacted
their fraud department who contacted me.
The second time it flared up, I received a suspension notice from New Hampshire Department of For The Record, Inc.

time what I should do to alert the three credit reporting agencies to the fraud.

If you can remember
back, panelists, to when you first made that phone call, either to the police or credit reporting agency or a creditor, trying to tell them that you were a victim of identity theft, and being handled by whatever procedures they might have set up to deal with victims, I would like to focus on that for a moment, because I think that's a very important For The Record, Inc.

It's important for you to be able to get the responses that you need as a victim of identity theft, but let's talk about what actually happened.
Nicole, we'll go back to you.
When you first
reported the fraud to the credit reporting agencies, what was that process like for you? MS. ROBINSON: Well, I call it my weekend of
anxiety, because I was contacted on a Friday night, so I had to wait until Monday morning, and I think it would have been helpful to be able to contact the credit reporting agencies right then.
I was on hold
at work all day Monday trying to get in contact with the three reporting agencies.
I did manage to get
two on the phone, I believe it was Experian and Equifax. phone.
With Trans Union, I couldn't get a person on the phone, and because the individual had applied for so much credit, they had changed the information on my credit file.

And it was
really frustrating, because I didn't know that the fraud alert was going to go on there right away.
With the other two, I did know that they would put it on right away, but with Trans Union, I didn't know when the fraud alert was going to be placed on there, because I couldn't get a person on the phone.
So, it was really frustrating.
And when you were talking to

CRANE:
live personnel at the other two agencies, how much information were you able to find out from them about what was in your credit report at that time? MS. ROBINSON: Only one.
Experian was able
to give me a number of recent inquiries, and because I hadn't applied for any credit a year prior to this happening, she was able to give me phone numbers to the places that had requested my credit, so I was able to get working on that right away.

We had to drill down through a lot of
different automated messages to get anything.
And with one of the agencies, I believe it was Trans Union, we had to fax ID, you know, a copy of the driver's license, a copy of the social security number.
And I believe also a utility bill,
even though he didn't have one, it would have been ours.
And none of them would tell us anything over
the phone because we couldn't really get a person.
And so, you know, everybody has these weeks of anxiety, or days, at least, and ours was that, because we had to wait in the mail for, you know, wait for the mail to come to show the listings from the credit reporting agencies.
And like I said earlier, it was hard to decipher, initially.
And so you really don't have
anybody to talk to at the beginning, and that's -as I look back on it, and I think things have progressed where I know the thing that I got from the FTC with regards to, you know, how to handle bad credit with your good name or something like that, that has a lot of good things now, but in '98, I don't know if it was surfacing yet, and I certainly For The Record, Inc.

And so, you know, police reports and, you
know, putting credit fraud alerts weren't occurring until early this year.
MS.
CRANE: Was it particularly hard to get
the credit report because it wasn't on your own behalf but on behalf of a dependent? MR. GRAVES: Yeah, actually it was.
I had
to have my son go through this whole thing, and it was, you know, I had to try to give him crib sheets on, you know, what numbers to punch to get through the thing, and then he could put his, you know, voice on the recording and request it.

first thing we did was contact the three credit bureaus, both via phone call and in writing.

tell you without exaggeration, over the course of the first three days upon discovery, we were on the phone for nine hours, because I've logged pretty much every minute that we spent on this thing, and later when I tell you the number, you will be amazed, I hope.

right department, trying to get through voice mails, et cetera.
We did the same thing, we faxed copies
of IDs, social security numbers, all those cards and all that sort of thing.
I can also say, at some point during this process, we went down to the 45th Precinct in the Bronx to talk to their detectives about the frauds we reported initially and do something about it.
Because the credit card companies were making us feel like -- as an earlier speaker said, that we were guilty before being proven innocent.
And even
though the crime was against -- technically it was against the companies, it was up to us to prove our innocence.
So, we go to the police department, basically got laughed out of there.
We pretty much

So, I really got the run-around, and finally I told them I knew where this person was, that she was down in Orlando, I know it's her, and I had called the Orlando police, you know, given her address, and they said well, you know, this happened in D.C., what do you expect us to do about it.
So, when I talked to the Secret Service, who I think he was just placating me, you know, to make me feel better, because he told me he wasn't going to take care of the case, he called me back a few days later and he said that he had someone that they dealt with in Orlando in the economics crimes department.
So, I got in touch with that person, and they were really able to help me, and they've been working with me, even though it may really not be in their jurisdiction, but after I gave him information, he found out that this person had an outstanding warrant, they were able to arrest her.
They aren't able to arrest her for what she did to me, because they're still trying to prove the case, but I'm still -- it's still being worked on.

experience reporting to the police, and your case was acted upon, correct? MR. GRAVES: It hasn't been acted upon --
well, I guess it depends upon your determination of acted upon, or the definition of it.
I guess I feel I
guilty that I didn't file this report earlier.
just didn't think of it as a criminal crime, I guess a crime that the police would follow up on, and I guess in retrospect, I'm still right, but I did file it.
You know, I did file it, and it was because it
was the only thing that the creditors, actually not the creditor, but the person collecting the DWT bill would accept so that they could see that yeah, I am contesting the issue for my son, that this isn't him that owes the money, and so I had to file a police report.
So, from that aspect, we filed it late, and they took the report, but they didn't -- they xeroxed a lot of the information.

I had to send back a form, spend $13 with a check, wait weeks for the LAPD to return my report so I could have a full report of the issue, and then I got a letter about a few weeks after that saying that it's been turned over to their financial investigation team.
And this was back in March, I
believe, that we reported it, of this year, we still haven't heard from any person, a detective or anything, as far as a follow-up.
MR. GENERA: If I could just add something
to this, one of the things that was made plain to us by a lot of the creditors, and as I said, I believe there are 14 total, well, go down to your police department, get yourself a police report number or whatever, and we'll take over the investigation from there.
We did that, it didn't do one bit of good
with any of the agencies or the creditors themselves.

MR. GREER: I would say in my case, and I
was notified by the fraud investigator about nine days after all the activity started, so I was very, very lucky in that there was minimal activity.
And
because I was well within the first billing cycle, I had -- it was very easy and almost pleasurable to deal with everybody.
And I was able to place the
security alerts, find out from the creditors or from the reports which accounts were most active, most recently active, and I was able to contact them directly, and I shut down three of the initial five accounts without any loss to anybody.

Okay, so why don't we

thinking we could even do it in the categories, you know, if you wanted to do it that way, the categories of creditors and credit reporting.
Let's
do creditors first and then collection companies.
MR. GENERA: I have one suggestion for
creditors and credit reporting companies, follow the federal regulations.
Do what you're supposed to do.
You know, as I said, 14 creditors, out of those 14, five sent us affidavits of fraud.
not.
The others did
We ended up drafting a boiler plate affidavit
of fraud on our computer and sending it out to the remaining companies.
If you're claiming this account does belong to us, follow the regulations.
You need to provide
us, as you would in a criminal case, you need to provide us evidence that this is our account.
And
if you can't do so, or you refuse to do so, then get it the hell off our credit report, okay? Forgive my anger, okay, we've -- this has ruined our life, okay? I can literally say we have

to prove that the documentation not generated by us that we are the victim of fraud.

need documentation from the fraudulent accounts.

And, you know, we went down in December of
'98, right after this occurred, it occurred in September of '98, we went down while my son was on vacation, we went down to social security to get my son a new number.

would be a big mistake, but, you know, we went down there and we got a couple of windows, people we talked to, the clerks just didn't take it seriously.

Now, all these people are saying we're guilty until we're proven innocent, which was the same thing that happened to me.
And what you're
talking about, Joe, this particular law that we have in California, if it was nationwide, or if it was applied to all three bureaus in all states, then the burden would shift and you would be innocent until proven guilty, and so that's one very strong suggestion I think that's helpful for victims in California, and I think it should be applied nation-wide.
I know Diane was talking about she was going to apply that, Trans Union nationwide, that that way you wouldn't be getting all these verifications, you would have it blocked, and then they would have to prove that it was not fraud.

of this already, but I don't know, I think because there's three different agencies, it seems like that may be a good thing, because they have different ways of pursuing things rather than just one.

FRANK: MR. GRAVES: And they're competitors.

is frustrating dealing with three different natures of an organization, and to get the fraud alert out, which we finally did, that was different with all of them, too.

that have told me, and I'm sure you've even told me that it would be helpful to have some uniformity in how you read these credit files, because each one is different and it's very difficult to decipher and get through it to have those three credit files a little more uniform and the procedures more uniform so we can work at least for the fraud purposes in the same way.

ask, in your comments, I think, Mari, you said that in one of your listings here that sometimes when you're doing, as all of us would do, we want to get reports from the credit reporting agencies.

sent the letter saying that I did not initiate this request, they are still not coming off.
And I have harassed the businesses that have done it, and they said we've contacted them.

MS.
FRANK: And so one of the things we
talked about in our hand-out is we need to have the credit reporting agencies immediately when they're notified of fraud to send out at the addresses and phone numbers of all of the accounts on there, including the inquiries so that we can contact them and get it removed.
And they're supposed to contact
them, anyone who has been -- any company that has made an inquiry in the last six months, but my understanding is under federal law, you have up to a year to issue credit, and so I think it should be for a year that we give the names and telephone numbers and addresses of all the inquiries for the last year so that immediately, so that you can get those off, like you're talking about.
MR. GRAVES: MR. GENERA: Can I add -- go ahead, Joe.
If we're talking about
consistency, I think the one stop fraud alert is a great idea.
To the credit reporting agencies, As
within your own offices, you need consistency.
an example, Trans Union maintains various offices For The Record, Inc.

On the very same day, I believe
it was November 9th of last year, Trans Union generated two credit reports, one from their Fullerton, California office, and one from their West Haven, Connecticut office.
One showed two of
these judgments being deleted, West Haven office showed one of them being re-inserted on the very same day.
MS.
FRANK: So, we need consistency and we
need training, we need to make sure that all of the credit reporting agencies are training their people in the same procedures.
MR. GRAVES: That's what I was going to
mention, Joe mentioned, I don't know how these guys did it with as many things that were put on their credits, you know, history, trying to keep track of the reports that you get back, because there's this delay, you know, you're sending a request in to clarify or clear something up, and then maybe you receive -- like in my case, I maybe didn't see the next thing until I sent two requests in separately, and then you're trying to tie one report with another, and sometimes the two reports cross in the mail and, you know, somehow it's got to be a better way to reference your inquiry to the response you're For The Record, Inc.

MS.
FRANK: If you could be assigned to one
person, I think that would make it a lot easier because then there would be consistency like you're talking about, Joe, Rob, is that we're trying to say that one person would be assigned to you so that you could write to that one person and not get mixed messages.
Deborah, do you want to add something with regard to the credit reporting agencies, another suggestion? MS.
NORTH: My situation just happened this
August, and a lot of the people here, they found out a couple of years ago, and I -- what I would say is that I think it's improved with the work of the people here, that the credit bureaus are getting better, because they have been helpful to me, however one suggestion I would have is when you have specific questions about your file, it should be available to you.
I mean, you shouldn't have to
fight to have a question answered on your file.
For example, I noticed a request for a file just a month after a lot of these accounts were opened, or other requests have been made from other For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
70 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 financial institutions, and so I had figured that this person was getting turned down because she had run up so much on my credit that she wasn't able to get it, and that would have helped me if they would have told me where that request went to, because if I had known where that request went to, I could have proved that she made the request, not me. would help me with the authorities.
MR. GENERA: Debbie, not to rain on your And that
parade, and I sincerely hope your report stays as it is, don't count on it.
You are so new to this, what
happened initially when we first reported it, two of the credit reporting agencies did take off every single account, said delete it, delete it, delete it, in fact on the Trans Union file, because we have everything on the Trans Union, I wrote across in big letters, resolved, we're done, yeah. still going.
MS.
NORTH: That's why I want the letters Uh-uhh, it's
from the creditors, because I know it can pop back up.
So, I need those letters from the creditors
saying I am clear on this so if they should report it again.
And it's not even on that account with
the creditors, they don't show it resolved, it's just open, they're going to report me again.
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025 So
71 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 that's why I need those letters.
MS.
FRANK: That's an important point, and I
know quite a few victims had been saying, and I know you also told me on the phone that, you know, under federal law we're entitled to a free credit report if you're a victim, and then of course you get another credit report until things are cleared up.
However, the problem is that often the information is re-inserted and the fraud comes back on or the fraudster goes and does it again.
So, we were suggesting that a free credit report be provided throughout the clean-up time, and then even when you think it's cleaned up, you should be given quarterly, for one year, at least, a free credit report, quarterly, for one year, after you think the fraud is off, because it does reappear, and that's happened to everyone.
And the other thing is we want you to know that you can ask some questions.

MR. GREER: I'm really in the thick of it Why don't we
right now, and the problems I'm having with law enforcement is just getting documentation and cooperation.
The assistant DA in the jurisdiction
that we contacted that had the warrants against me suggested that I turn myself in and have myself arrested, and that was how I was assisted.
I am the
victim here, and I initiated the action to correct this problem, and as a reward for that, they sent my name to New Hampshire DMV and I had my license yanked, a second time.
Just cooperation, and when somebody comes in good faith, I know it's very difficult to comprehend that, because you have people coming all day long to it's not me, I didn't do it, and I don't know how to differentiate between that, but yanking somebody's license when they're attempting to make good on something that they have just learned about two days prior is not really a cooperative way to do it.

nice to have some at least national protocol for how do you clean up a criminal record.

Let's go now to Eric. for law enforcement? MR. GRAVES:
Well, I guess because we were
suggested to go to the Secret Service, and I was pointed somehow through FBI and Secret Service towards the beginning of this year and somewhat towards the end of the process, and I couldn't believe that I was having to discuss those with them and I knew that my case wasn't going to qualify either, because it wasn't over $100,000, but people wouldn't divulge information.
You know, whatever they found, they sort of kept -- because of the different legislation that's been invoked, for rights of privacy, which I can understand to some extent, but when you're sitting on the other side and you feel you're innocent, and you want to get the information that they have found, if any, you know, they say they can't give it to you.

think that they need somebody that's really going to devote time.

think it will have to be another branch that's created or something, I can't imagine that they've got -- like I think people have said, there's other things, there's burglaries and such that are, you know, very high priority, right for that instant, and they are going to put you on the bottom.

CRANE: Let me just explain what our
database is right now and then we can talk about what we mean by our information.
Right now our
database contains the identifying information of the victim, their name, address, and it is optional, you can remain anonymous.
It's name, address, social
security number and date of birth, if you choose to give that information.
We also have similar information collected about the suspects, so if you have any information at all that you believe pertains to the person who you think did this to you, that goes into our database as well.
We code the types of identity theft that have affected the victim, whether it's relating to credit cards or utilities, securities and investments, bankruptcy, so we code it by type.
also try to collect information on the date it occurred and the date the victim first noticed, the amount that the suspect got away with, and the amount of loss out of the victim's pocket.
For The Record, Inc.

We also code in
as many of the institutions -- well, we code up too five institutions involved.
So, if someone has opened 14 accounts in your name, we don't have the time and resources to collect all 14, but we'll take the top five, which by either were the largest accounts or bills run up, or which five did you have the most trouble with in trying to clear your name.
So, all that information is in there right now and we do currently share it with law enforcement nationwide through our Consumer Sentinel system, law enforcement can come in and read reports in every system.
Now, Mari, what are you asking for in addition to that specifically? MS.
FRANK: Well, it probably would help to
have all the fraud accounts, that would be helpful, but I think one of the things that would be extremely helpful, would have law enforcement to be trained on how to access that, and so when a victim goes there, they will immediately access that information and give you a report.
And perhaps if
it's from one state to another, you've got this For The Record, Inc.

MS.
CRANE: We have been doing a lot of
outreach with police and law enforcement nationwide, and certainly the number of departments that are accessing our database are growing.
Once you're on
there, it is fairly self explanatory on how to do a search.
There are also fields in there on what So, if

enforcement agencies, that police department, that report number, that officer's name and phone number are all in there.

got everything that you are suggesting.

getting the word out and having, you know, someone to do that.

In his history, I think it's -- I'm not sure,
but my understanding of reading the credit agency report was that it's cleared, but it's still in history on the credit report, and can be, you know, it's still there for someone to really dig out.
I wanted to be able to put a motion forward without hiring a lawyer, sorry, and, you know, do it on our own.
I mean I think a lot of people are in
my situation where you don't want to have to afford a lawyer, there ought to be a means in the court that you would be put on record, similar to filing a police report, that you are on record to contest this particular person's ID with this case.
And I
haven't found out how to do that yet, maybe it's very simple, but I haven't found a way.

tomorrow on the bankruptcy panel and I think that's going to be very important, but I think that's a very important issue.
MR. GRAVES: When I went to the court, they
just had nothing to tell me, that I couldn't do it, and I nabbed some person who looked like a lawyer on the way out and got their suggestions and he of For The Record, Inc.

MS.
FRANK: One of the important things that
I hear of hearing from all the victims and the thousands of victims that I talk to and experience myself, the various agencies that we have to deal with really don't have a protocol, don't have a list of what we have to do in my agency to clean up your name.
And I think that each creditor, I mean all
the creditors and all the credit reporting agencies, and all of the -- and law enforcement and the courts need to say this is the protocol that you need to have that you need to follow and we'll help you.
And they need to set up steps, and they need to train their people so that we know what to do to clean up the mess, to expunge that record, because that record is going to be sold over and over by data brokers, and your son is going to have a bankruptcy all over the place.
MR. GRAVES: Well, when we went in to try to
rectify this, I think, you know, it boils down to the fact that all of us have experienced, there's one person doing too many jobs, and they don't -- it can't be possible to know all the protocol and procedures, but somehow it has to be disseminated.

FRANK: Right.
And the other thing that
we wanted to talk about for just a minute is when you talked about changing the social security number, a lot of people think that that's the right thing to do, and I think that the Social Security Administration, or hopefully when they speak today, and I know that there's people here from the Social Security Administration.
They need to advise you why you shouldn't change your social security number, and see that social security number is attached to you.
Maybe
for your son isn't so bad because he hasn't this long history.
But I've had a client who too had a
criminal record who he changed his social security number because his -- he was mixed with a person who had committed crimes, and so to clean up his record, he was told to change his social security number, and it actually worsened the problem, because the old file and the old social security number gets linked in all the different databases, so it looks more suspicious.
So, it isn't always the best thing to do.
But any agency that's trying to help a victim to clean up your record need to really tell them, the victims, the ramifications of why they aren't doing For The Record, Inc.

like to add is the time that you're actually For The Record, Inc.

Whenever you're
awake, it's always in your forethought, you're thinking about it always.
MS.
NORTH: I'm relatively new to this, just
starting in August, so, and I would really rather not have my employer know how much time I have spent on this, but several days, and of course it's all 9:00 to 5:00, as you know, if you want to do business.
So, it makes it very difficult.
I think all told, well I
MS. ROBINSON:
spent the entire summer working on this, every morning through June, July and August, I spent working on this, and because it happened in Texas, I've -- I got like a six-page phone bill, like $500.
So, back and forth.
Even when I filed the report
with the Texas police, they told me they had to call me collect to take my report.
that as well.
So, it's been -- the phone bills have been higher than the postage bills, because I had to do the mailings to everybody who did the inquiries, and like I said, there were 80.
So, the phone bills I So, I had to pay for
think were the biggest, but the time spent on the phone, I mean all summer, like 90 days in the For The Record, Inc.

MS.
FRANK: And of course not getting a
human on the other end.
MS. ROBINSON: Yes, or getting somebody
saying oh, well, we don't handle that, the credit reporting agency has to send us a dispute form and, you know, so it's been a lot of hours.
MS.
FRANK: MR. GRAVES: Eric? Yeah, I guess I'm at the low
end as well, probably 180 hours to 200 I would say, and a lot of it like Deborah said is, you know, unfortunately during 9:00 to 5:00 hours, so you're taking time at work and you've got to, you know, somehow make up that time.
And so that's been And
flexible for me, that's been fortunate.
probably $150, but the big thing is my son's credit.
I mean he's young, I wanted to get him on the track of getting a good credit reference, and I think he's lost two years in that process.
MS.
FRANK: We had some more questions.
Could you say who you are and where you're from.
That would help us.
MS. NEWHOUSE: My name is Joan Newhouse, I
am a commissioner for the Texas Commission on Private Security.
I'm also a private investigator
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
90 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 in Houston.
I concentrate on fraud, and so I've got
a great business going in Houston right now.
My question is that in the course of my investigations, I regularly come across people who are perpetrating identity fraud.
I have tried, and
I don't know how many occasions to report it, and there is no one who wants the information.
In some
cases, it is someone who is perpetrating the fraud against the Social Security Administration, and for purposes of welfare, I have faxed them the names with the multiple social security numbers, I get no response.
In other instances, someone's credit is being ruined.
If it is like in my looking for a
witness, I end up finding the person that I am looking for, their identity has been stolen by someone else.
I have talked to that person about
it, and then contacted the credit agencies and the credit agencies say that I cannot report it unless I am a member of the credit agency, so I have to pay $1,500 a year to be able to report the fraud that is being perpetrated.
MS.
CRANE: I would like to respond to that
just very quickly and also we're coming to the end of our session.
As of the beginning of 2001, we For The Record, Inc.

So, we will be
taking complaints from third parties, not just victims.
So, please, you know, right now we're developing that, but it should be up by January 1st, and so you'll be able to at least report it to us.
And as I said, law enforcement will at least have access and they believe be able to see all of the information that you provide when they log onto our system.
Thank you very much, audience, panelists, press, for participating in this event today.

Now we're We're
going to roll up our sleeves a little bit.
going to roll up our sleeves a little bit and get to work.
This next panel is clearing up the victims' credit history part one.
We're going to be
moderated today by Helen Foster, who is an attorney in our Division of Planning and Information and is on the staff of our identity theft program, and Christopher Keller, who is an attorney from our Division of Financial Practices, and is himself an expert on the credit laws.
And so, Chris and Helen,
thank you very much, and thank you all.
MS.
FOSTER: Thank you.
As Betsy mentioned,
the focus of this panel will be streamlining and improving the processes of consumer reporting agencies when they are dealing with victims of identity theft.
I just want to briefly introduce the panel.
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
93 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 And I'm going to start on my far right.
We have Well,
Nicole Robinson, who you heard from earlier.
I'm hoping that she's coming back.
Robin Holland
from Equifax, Ed Mierzwinski from CALPIRG, Barry Smith from Bank of America, on my immediate right is Chris Keller, my colleague.
To my left, Maxine
Sweet from Experian, Robert Greer, we missed him, we lost him, he will come back.
Diane Terry, from
Trans Union, Phil McKee from Internet Fraud Watch, Eric Graves, who we have heard from earlier as a victim of identity theft, and Stuart Pratt from the Associated Credit Bureaus.
We're going to begin by talking, we're going to take this in a little bit of reverse order.
We're going to begin by talking about consumer reporting agencies dispute processes and the process that a consumer goes through once they have contacted the credit reporting agency, and identify themselves as a victim of identity theft.
After that, we will talk about the fraud alert, which we have also heard a little bit about in the previous panel, and then we will move to the proposal for one-stop shop.
I know that in the last
panel it was mentioned as well as is this something that we have done or is it something that we are For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
94 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Greer.
going to do.
It's still a proposal, it's something
that we are really hoping to make progress on today.
So, that will be the order of our discussion, and our methodology will be similar to what we pursued in the last panel, where Chris and I will throw out questions and issues and we will ask panelists to join into the discussion and then we will pause to take questions from the floor, as we progress through each topic.
And we would ask if
you have a question or a comment from the floor that you wait until a microphone gets to you before you start to speak.
Now we have Nicole Robinson and Robert Okay, in the last panel, we heard quite a
bit about reporting processes and dispute processes by the consumer report agencies, and I wanted to start by giving the consumer reporting agencies a chance to tell us a little bit about how their processes actually work.
And like I said, we're
kind of starting backwards, but after a fraud alert has been placed on a consumer's report, and when they're dealing with the individual items on their credit report, Maxine or Diane, could you speak to exactly what they can expect to experience at that point in terms of resolving individual items on For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
95 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 their credit report.
MS.
SWEET: I'll start.
Just briefly, let
me -- we do have different processes, so it's good that we're all three here, although they are somewhat standard and they don't vary significantly, there are just some minor differences.
But the
Experian standpoint, when you contact us and a fraud alert goes on immediately, but it's a 90-day temporary fraud alert, and we wait for you to send us proof of your identity before we put a permanent alert on there.
And again, that's one of those you have to make people work harder to protect them.
So, if you
send us proof of your identity, then we will put a permanent statement on that stays seven years.
I
was very encouraged to hear the FTC clearinghouse talk about not only sending victims to the credit reporting agencies, but also letting them know that they need to contact the creditors and to fill out the affidavits and documents there, because that to me is a very important part of the process.
Yes, they should contact the credit reporting company, obviously we're very important in letting you be aware of what may have gone on, and yes we will dispute the fraudulent items on your For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
96 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 behalf back to the creditor, but victims should be informed it is very important that they also contact the creditor directly.
MS.
FOSTER: So, once they have done those
two, I don't mean to interrupt you, once they have done those two steps, what can they expect in terms of how the procedure works in disputing each item? MS.
SWEET: Okay, they let us know which
ones are fraudulent, we send a notice to the creditor that it is flagged as a fraud dispute, and then the creditor comes back to us and hopefully removes the fraudulent accounts from the creditor's report.
We then send a new report back to the
consumer as some of the victims noted earlier, letting them know the results of that.
MS.
FOSTER: Once -- when you communicate
with a creditor about -- and I'm not addressing this to just Maxine, any of the consumer reporting representatives can feel free to answer.
Once you
are communicating with the creditor, do you communicate that this account has been identified as a victim of identity theft, or someone has said that this is not my account, because I understand that there are different ways that someone can have incorrect information on a consumer report.
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
97 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 It can be that the information was generally mixed because there were similar names or other kinds of identification errors and then there's the separate problem of someone who has purposefully gone out and gotten credit in your name, so I am just wondering how those differences are accounted for in dealing with a creditor, because that seems to be helpful for creditors to know.
MS. TERRY: Diane Terry from Trans Union.
What we have established is a fraud department, and in that department, one of the processes is as we are talking about the consumer, we are adding the alert to the file immediately, but probably the second step in those lines is we're talking to the consumer and we're reviewing the credit file for all recent new accounts as well as any recent new inquiries.
Now, when we go over the file with the consumer, if he's unaware of that inquiry or new account, what happens is we're providing the consumer with the address and phone information for that company, as well as we're sending an alert to that credit grantor in his behalf alerting them that the consumer is indicating they're unaware of this account, it's fraudulent.
So, we send that alert
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
98 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 request.
out the same day we talk to the consumer.
Now, we also -- now, that is going to our credit grantor's fraud department.
They're most
familiar with this type of crime, we need to get it to the people that understand identity theft.
Secondly, we do send out a reverification That's in addition to this fraud alert.
Now, we're sending that out asking them to reverify all the information on the account as well.
that's part of our seven-step process that we complete on behalf of the consumer.
MS.
FOSTER: So, when the reverification So,
request goes out in addition to the kind of creditor fraud alert that you just talked about.
MS. TERRY: MS.
FOSTER: Yes.
Is that also flagged as
consumer reported fraud, or is it just flagged as, you know, consumer says not their account? treated separately? MS. TERRY: Well, there's two different Is it
alerts, and again, the first alert is very, very specific to we're telling the company that's inquired, for example, the credit grantor, yesterday you inquired, we're giving them a specific day, and we've talked to the consumer and he's indicating For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
99 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 that this is fraudulent.
know, to this effect.
We also in that letter let the credit grantor know that we have advised the consumer to contact you as well, but we are getting this to you immediately in their behalf, and we think that's a very important part of the process.
MR. PRATT: Helen, if I could, Stuart Pratt First of all, We are alerting you, you
with the Associated Credit Bureaus.
we think clearly with a process like ours, which is fairly complicated, it might be helpful to begin to move towards something that explains a little more easily just generally what your rights are under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, because again, as we're describing what we're doing here today, it is in part what we must do to resolve the consumer's circumstance, the victim's circumstance, as quickly as possible.
And it's in part our responsibilities
and duties under the Fair Credit Reporting Act melded together that help us get the job done.
First of all, ACB has produced a new brochure, which outlines the flow chart, if you will, of the process of dispute resolution, and for anybody, of course, who needs a copy, we make this available to states attorneys general offices and to For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 other consumer protection offices and have been doing so for some time now.
And this is one way for
every consumer to just say okay, I understand generally with the flow chart, I have heard several of our victims here say, you know, a couple of years ago I wasn't really sure I knew what to do next and I wasn't sure what the flow chart was, what should I expect to happen after I make that first phone call.
This is our way of responding to that saying there is a way for you to understand, if you will, what the flow chart is.
We have also produced an English and a Spanish language version of essentially all your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which is just a way to explain in a written form.
And, Helen, to answer your question more specifically about these fraud alerts, we also as the Associated Credit Bureaus coordinate the development of an automated consumer dispute verification system which is a nation-wide network that links us with all of our major data furnishers, and we do have specific codes that allow us to transmit a consumer's dispute as a fraud alert or as an identity theft alert, different from, say, a mixed file or different from just a not my account For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
101 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 kind of communication.
So, we are able to parse through and communicate with our data furnisher customers to make sure they are getting the correct information on their end to they can take the right actions on their end.
MS.
FOSTER: Well, like what we talked about
on the earlier panel, and we will keep going back to this, part of the challenge has been for you and for us is to get the word out.
What we hear often from
consumers is I just don't understand what's going on, and the information is out there to be had, but the challenge is on us and on you, I think, to make the system a little bit more transparent so that when a consumer calls and they -- part of the anxiety is not knowing what to expect.
MR. PRATT: I think that's right, I think
it's very difficult, because any new crime, it's kind of a vortex.
You enter into it, and you have
no idea who you are supposed to call first or what the next step is, and candidly, an educated consumer is a much better victim for us because we're going to work through that process more efficiently, they know what to communicate to us.
Our whole goal is to purge that file of that For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
102 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 negative, fraudulent information, which isn't the consumer's, which is stopping them from getting on with their lives.
And you've heard that today.
Helen, this is Robin Holland
MS. HOLLAND: from Equifax.
We recognize often that when
consumers call us that they are so shocked and overwhelmed that fraud may have been committed that we will speak with them on the phone, but we also mail out to them five steps that they should follow.
We place that fraud alert on their file immediately and that fraud alert stays for six months, and then we transfer it to a permanent alert if they are verified as victims of fraud.
But we outline that
when we send them a copy of their disclosure and we tell them the five steps that they should go through and we explain it in what we believe is very user friendly English.
MS.
FOSTER: One of the things that we are
drifting into now that I want to come back to is effectiveness of the fraud alerts and how fraud alerts work, but while we're still on the process of clearing a consumer credit report, one of the things that was thrown out in the earlier panel was about standardization of being able to look at a credit report from each of the three consumer reporting For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
103 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 agencies and read it relatively the same way, and I know recognizing that you're competitors and that you can't, you know, share information the way that non-competitors can share information.
Is there a
movement afoot to do that, to make credit reports standardized in terms of how to read them? MR. PRATT: Well, let me respond to that in
part by the challenge we have, which is there are three different, as you know, three different file disclosures that are out there today.
Put those
three disclosures in front of maybe just the panelists or if you put them in front of everybody here in the audience and they each looked, you would probably find almost as many opinions about favoring one of the disclosures versus the other two.
And one of the great challenges is, for example, some of our members have moved towards text-message-based disclosures, meaning I can read what's on the file.
My wife candidly hates those
because she's very analytical and she prefers numbers and columns and prefers to read it in a more compacted form.
Now that wouldn't suit somebody I get a
else who is just interested in reading it. greater sense of comfort.
So, one of the challenges, Helen, is to For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
104 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 design something, a disclosure which works for the 180 to 200 million consumers who may have access to their file disclosure.
So, we know that there will
be some unevenness, in terms -- I think, in fact, Ms. Graves just said, sometimes learning in first, how to read that file disclosure is an element of the frustration.
We are always working with focus groups, individually the companies are, to try to move those disclosures to make them work properly for consumers, but I think you will still see some variance out there in the future, because I don't think there is one right answer.
I think it's going
to be very difficult to get to that point.
MS.
FOSTER: I understood, and maybe I'm
having a misrecollection, but I thought that there was a process evolving now among the credit reporting agencies, the big three, to make some sort of standard report.
Are you guys working on that,
or have you just told me that that's not happening or it's not able to happen? MR. PRATT: I think what you saw in our
initiatives, you may be referring to our initiatives.
MS.
FOSTER: I am.

105 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 MR. PRATT: And the Associated Credit
Bureaus did in March of this year issue a press release describing six points that we wanted to address in this year with regard to identity theft, to change practices, to improve basically based on interviews with victims ourselves.
One of those initiatives which is an ongoing, it goes beyond a particular effective date is just standardizing.
We heard this on the panel
this morning, it's not really a revelation that the more consistent I am between the various systems, for example let's take a conference call we had just last week where we talked about which validating documents would be good ones to use.
And, Mr.,
Graves I have just learned something today, which is if you have a young son, they may not have a utility bill yet, for example, so maybe just saying rigidly you will always use utility bills isn't very effective, because we will have some younger -- in fact we had a young fellow who testified at an ID theft hearing on the Hill, who is also young enough.
He didn't actually have a utility bill yet.
So, we
are trying to learn, for example, standardize what requests we might make so you don't have to dig up ten different documents to meet the needs of three For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
106 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 different companies.
We are also hosting conference calls on a regular base to standardize and learn from each other what kinds of practices are working when we're interplaying with the consumer.
Helen, that's
different, though, from saying what we're moving towards a single file disclosure standardization, is it on the table, is it off the table, it's really neither.
If that makes sense as we work our way
through this process beyond this press release, that will be on the table for discussion.
MS.
FOSTER: I am going to switch gears here
to an issue that came up and comes up frequently when consumers call us, which is the issue of reappearance of information.
We heard this on the
panel this morning, earlier this morning, where accounts that you've cleared and you think okay, I'm in the clear, and then suddenly the accounts come back either reported by the same creditor, or reported by a different creditor, for example, a collection agency has now taken over that account and they are now reporting it under their name.
Without going into the issues that will be addressed after lunch in terms of furnishers of information and how all of that works, I'm wondering For The Record, Inc.

MS. BENNER: I might be able to speak on Last if there has been thought, and I would like to hear if there has, or if any of the panelists have thoughts on this topic on what -- how reappearance cases could be handled differently.
to this end of the table.
MR. KELLER: the victims.
Let's say we first hear from Maybe I'll move
How did you find out, and this would
be in an instance where you were initially successful, for whatever reason, the accounts were taken off the report, but then you discovered at a later date that they had been re-inserted.
you find out about that? How did
Were you notified, or did Can we start
you find out in some other fashion?
with the victims, because I think that might be an interesting context.
MS.
FOSTER: victim who had that.
MS. ROBINSON: MS.
FOSTER: I didn't have re-insertion.
I don't think we have a victim I'm not sure that we have a
that actually, Janine Benner from CALPIRG.
spring, along with the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, we conducted a survey of a bunch of victims of identity thefts asking them about their situations, For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
108 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 and we found out that almost half of the people that we surveyed actually had fraud reoccur despite the placement of a fraud alert on their credit reports.
And I think the one thing that we have discussed that might help that from happening is to actually prevent the issuance of credit completely after the fraud alert has been placed on the account.
MS.
FOSTER: But you're talking about the
issuance of new credit in new accounts, what I'm referring to is when a single account has been cleared from a person's credit report, you know, X, Y, Z, creditor, you know, 160 days late, and then so it's been cleared and you get a credit report and it's no longer there, and then three months, six months, a year later, that same account seems to reappear on a person's credit report, either reported by the same furnisher, or reported by a debt collector, and I'm wondering again, back to an issue of identifying these problems within the consumer reporting agencies, once these issues have been addressed, or once these accounts have been cleared, are you able to know that this was an account that was cleared and therefore won't come back? MR. PRATT: Helen, part of the response, we

I mean, we can always start with the
predicate of what the law requires of us in the first place, reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy.
MS.
FOSTER: No, I'm understanding that, I'm
kind of looking at it from the victim's point of view, is there a way I can communicate with somebody at the credit reporting agency who will know that I was a victim and this has happened to me before.
MR. PRATT: I was just going to say, with
regard to the law, we have the responsibility to inform the conumser if we re-insert data that was previously deleted as the result of a re-investigation, so the law does trigger at least one type of communication, it's going to be important to know whether that is working properly in the marketplace, but that is an element of what was built into the 1996 amendments to the FCRA.

My recommendation is once it's been flagged as a fraudulent address or an address that should be identified with the imposter, if it's been rereported, ideally, I would hope Trans Union would have some sort of even a postcard notification that this information has been rereported, it's been reported by this particular company, and you need to investigate it.

So, we are looking at pilot testing programs that will allow us to stay in touch with consumers, that is one of the initiatives we announced this year and we are in the process right now of pilot testing programs to try to determine what kinds of triggers should cause us to get back in touch with that consumer, beyond the initial re-investigation time frame.
So, I do think that's one of the more
progressive steps we are trying to take because, in fact, this is a different crime and it's newer and it's different than the kinds of crimes we've experienced previously when working with law enforcement and so on.
So, hopefully as we progress down this road, maybe we're on the right track with that one that that's something that will help victims and us as well, that will keep that file whole down the road.

In the process, our counselors hear a lot of times that information keeps reappearing on the credit report.
And it would be curious to me to
find out, because I know that when we take in consumer complaints on other types of fraud, we are one of the data contributors to Consumer Sentinel.
And frequently the consumer has contacted us and they may have also -- they may inform our counselors after the report is made that they have also spoken with Operation Phone Busters in Canada, or they may have also spoken to one of the other data contributors to Consumer Sentinel.
And in our discussions with Consumer Sentinel, the actual gatekeepers at the FTC, we know that there is a suppression database, that if one of our reports has already been entered into Consumer Sentinel by one of these other agencies, the computer does match up the information and is able to make a note.

of the challenges of the databases we have.
maintain suppression databases, because obviously if you simply delete information from your data base, you will never know whether it's coming back in again.
So, of course, you have to suppress, and
then maintain it as a suppression database.
You've also made another good point, which is that it is more challenging if, for example, the data has been sold as part of a portfolio from one lending institution to the other, and whether or not the lending institution is transferring the right fraudulent information so the account doesn't become once again a collection account, for example, at the new institution.

So, we have actually
produced for the data furnishers and we've standardized this in the early nineties, and this is the most recent edition of this, this is called the Metro 2 format.
This actually, if we can get every
one of our data furnishers to use the Metro 2 format, we will do a much better job and continue to improve the job we're doing to block those incoming trade data where we have taken it off the file in the first place.
So, this is yet another step that we have This is available on our website for the
customers to access, if you will, the data furnishers to access, and this Metro 2 even includes a whole series of guides that are very specific to utility company reporting, student loan reporting, guaranteed agencies, lender servicers, third party collection agencies.
These are guide posts in the
back of the book to tell them specifically how to handle their data properly in order for us to do our job.
So, hopefully, again, this is part of our effort to standardize.

We did have great difficulty in 1996 gaining any right to sue banks and other furnishers of information.
We did gain a very modest right to
have individual consumers sue them, a private right of action, if they failed to comply with re-investigation procedures.
Unfortunately, many
creditors have been seizing on one bad opinion by one judge out there in the hinterlands, and they've been trying to overturn that private right of action, which is really a disappointment to me.
Because it was very clear that Congress created that private right, but obviously I think Congress needs to go back to the well and give consumers a private right of action against furnishers for any violation.

something, but I'm still not clear on what the obligations of the credit bureau is with regard to material that's been flagged as fraudulent or a victim of identify theft.
We've heard different things about the credit bureaus are required to notify the person before, but then we've heard that they're not required to notify, and that, Mr. Pratt, you've discussed a pilot program for keeping in touch with people, but I wasn't clear whether that meant you For The Record, Inc.

For instance, Linda Foley mentioned that, you know, addresses were reappeared four times by Trans Union.
Do addresses, even though they're
reported again, need to get flagged, need to get a contact with the consumer before they get put on the credit report, or is that something that doesn't qualify under the requirement that the consumer be notified again? MS.

question, since you were kind of going in and out of the microphone.
Your question is, what are the
obligations of the consumer reporting agencies in the first instance when something is reported to them as fraudulent, and then as we were going down the line, we were talking about obligations under reappearance.

Am I summarizing correctly? MR. PRATT: absolutely right.
I think that's right, that's This is why, again, we're looking
for voluntary efforts for our industry to move forward and explore what other triggers, if you will, might create the right communication.
Now, keep in mind that at the same time, I know when we're victims of any kind of crime, we're very focused on it, but at the same time, we have 42 million consumers moving in this country every year.
Six million second homes in this country.
A large
percentage of consumers have at least one address for work, and one address for home.
And so an
address management system is just one area of discussion, but it is difficult to parse through just volumes of activity that occur.
And at the
same time distinguish that from the victim's circumstance where it's coming back in again.
So, this is a challenge that I think we're still working on as an industry, but I think it's a well taken point.

I guess as a consumer from the
outside, I understand the difficulties that you all must have with the amount of information flying at you, but also as a consumer, I understand that you are able to make money off of my personal information, and therefore I believe that you have the responsibility to be careful with it and to figure all of that out, I don't care how difficult it is.
I've given you that information, perhaps
against my will sometimes, but because you're able to gain financially off of it, I believe that you should have the responsibility to take care of it, no matter what the difficulties are.
MR. PRATT: It's a good point.

that's why I think we're trying to move behind the pale of what the law requires and not sound like an industry that says well, this is what the law says, and that's what we're going to do.

have met all of your expectations today, but I can tell you that the people I'm working with are very committed to doing the job right for consumers and for victims both.

FOSTER: Switching gears a little bit,
and we will continue to take questions from the floor, and particularly at the end, but I wanted to move on to the fraud alert, because I know it was something that the victims talked quite a bit about earlier.
And one of the things that we hear
repeatedly, and I know we have heard this morning was, how can a fraud alert be made more effective in terms of once that fraud alert is placed on a consumer report, how can we make sure that the creditors or other users of the consumer report who look at it are understanding what it is, and are honoring it and giving it the type of attention it For The Record, Inc.

And I would like to kind of direct that open-ended question to Barry Smith, who graciously agreed to be the sole furnisher on -- or the sole creditor, representative of creditors on this panel.
Barry, do you have ideas about how credit fraud alerts could be made more effective or how they work or don't work? MR. SMITH: Well, I was pleased to come and
join this panel today and talk about fraud alerts, because my brother was recently a victim of ID theft, okay, and he turned to me as, quote, a professional in the business, and said what's the best way to get this resolved.
And I went up against many of the problems that they're talking about today.
And we went
through the standards of entering fraud alerts on the bureaus, and then since he was not doing business with Bank of America, I said why don't you apply for a card at Bank of America and let's see how the process works.
And I took an application, I
submitted it to the credit department, and the credit department was on the phone back to me in about 15 minutes and said there's a fraud alert on this person's file, do you really want to approve For The Record, Inc.

Well, they went through the contact, of course they received the information and said yes, but a decision point was reached there, I mean they could have approved that application, they may not have approved that application.
We happen to take
the business of fraud alerts and identity theft very, very seriously, stopping somewhere between 500 and a thousand attempts for credit each month that come in to us just through applications.
And when we do that, we do go out and contact the consumer, we find the correct consumer, and we notify them and send them information about the account.
seriously.
But if the fraud alert had not been picked up, or somebody just wasn't doing their job the way they were instructed to do it, an application could have been bought.
And I don't know, I kind of throw As I said, we take that very
out to the group, maybe we shouldn't send back full credit information when there's a fraud alert on the file.
Maybe we should send back something that's
truncated, something that's not enough information for the bank to make a prudent financial decision to grant credit to that individual.
For The Record, Inc.

In my brother's case, he had eight or nine different inquiries.
And I think it would have been
very beneficial if we had been notified by the bureaus when the inquiry came to the bureau, and there was a fraud alert on the file.
So, instead of
just responding back to the credit grantor, maybe some kind of notification should have come back to us.
And there's really two sources for that.
It's either the credit bureau sending that information back, or of course there is the credit grantor on receiving the information back with a fraud alert on it, should they notify the individual that an inquiry has been made.
And even if we
decide to deny credit, because most -- most fraud alerts on file say if you decide to grant credit, don't do so without notifying me first.
Well, when I pursued this with many credit For The Record, Inc.

We realized
your application address was different from the application address that we had received the application from, and therefore we declined the application, so therefore we didn't notify you.
I said boy, I really wish I could have been notified.
I called some people who had inquiries, and they told me I can't talk to you, I can only talk to your brother.
And I said why is that? And they And
said because he's the one that applied for credit.
And I said no, I think you've got that wrong, it was somebody else entirely.
And if you expect me to
find the crook and have the crook contact you to give you permission to talk to me about the application they submitted, I said this is getting a little bit silly.
So, I think that in our next session we're going to talk about some issues on the fraud affidavit and I am going to stay with that.

Maybe we have to get truncated
information back and get a name and address, a telephone number, to contact that person.
But if we ask the audience in the last seven years how many people in this room have moved or changed their telephone number.
I've changed cell
numbers at least once, okay, I haven't moved, but I know an awful lot of other people in my family have, and who would remember three or four years down the line to go back and update that fraud alert to say I no longer live at this address, now you have to contact me at that address, when, in fact, the whole thing may have gone away.

MS.
FOSTER: I want to come back to one of
the suggestions that you just made, that kind of the idea of a gateway system has been -- to build on what you just said, has been tossed out as if you are a creditor and you ask for a credit report from one of the bureaus, and the credit bureau has a fraud alert on that file, that they would then not transmit a full report back to you with a fraud alert, but rather require you to go through some additional verification type steps.
Now, the hurdle that you point out is a significant one, which is -- and it's open for discussion, length of time versus how do you make sure that the information is going to be updated when there's changes in address and changes of phone number, you know, it may be that, you know, you put that on -- if you put that on to some of the consumers, I think you're right, for seven years it's a little bit much to ask people to remember, oh, yeah, I have to update my fraud alert phone number or address.
On the other hand, that's what we're seeing.
We're seeing, you know, perpetrators who come back For The Record, Inc.

So, it's the same kind of process once they find somebody who is a victim who has worked for them, they come back.
I want to toss the idea of having a gateway system to the consumer reporting agency folks for comment.
MR. KELLER: Let me ask, perhaps there's a
threshold question that perhaps will be more successful than the last time, which is do the consumer reporting agencies currently differentiate in any fashion when they supply the consumer report, either pursuant to consumer disclosure or in response to a request from a credit grantor between those just normal ones and those that are flagged with a fraud alert? MR. PRATT: Well, let's go to that first,
and I think the first part of that answer is that For The Record, Inc.

We are now standardizing text messages in all three systems, so that where a system, a creditor system is scanning for the text message, they won't have to scan for three different text messages.
We're also inserting an alphanumeric
sequence, which is a spiffy way of just saying some numbers and some letters that don't mean anything, but they'll be consistent across the three companies.
So, here again, every creditor, we can tell them, go look for this alphanumeric sequence.
If
you don't want to scan for the whole text message, scan for the alphanumeric sequence.

That's one example.
We do tell you when the inquiring address is different than the address on the application -than on the file, so that you know that there's some difference between the two and that gives you a chance as the customer to authenticate and take additional steps to validate that application.
I think we are trying in partnership with our customers to find the right mix of triggers to communicate back-up stream.

was concentrating on is where there's been a report of an identity theft and a fraud alert placed on the file.

transmit the report and work with our customers to make sure they have the right information, Chris, but no, there is no gateway today, I think, using Helen's term.
MS.
FOSTER: Is there a variation, and I
just want to get the three representatives of the reporting agencies here to kind of follow up on Chris' question.
Is there variation in how that is
handled, or is it very uniform that a -- I guess where I'm going with this, a fraud alert is a fraud alert in terms of a consumer reports it and it's consumer reported as opposed to products like what Chris was talking about, which are anomaly alerts? Are those the same for you all or are there differences or are they different products? MS. TERRY: Diane Terry, Trans Union.
We
all have fraud alerts, but the verbiage may be a little different on each one.
But basically what
they're saying is to contact the consumer, to verify the application.
Ours is dated, we allow two phone
numbers, a day or evening number so that, you know, depending on when this application is made, the credit grantor can contact the consumer.

We do
have a different type of statement that we can add to the file that will say potential fraud victim, verify all information on the application, until we can get ahold of the consumer to confirm the situation.
And we feel that's a very important part
of what we do as well.

a chance to respond, is that okay? MS. BENNER: MS.

saying is true, the idea of the fraud alert is already pretty standard, and we're taking it even further to actually make the wording exactly the same.

MS. HOLLAND: Robin Holland from Equifax.
When we deliver a file, at the top of the file, right in that header information, we state in bold letters that the consumer is a fraud victim, and then at the end of the credit report, in pretext, we talk about fraudulent applications may be submitted, please call, et cetera, whatever that consumer would like to say.
Of course as Mr. Pratt said, we are moving that we will all have the same alphanumeric codes and the same standard message, but we do at the top, when you first see the file, it clearly states fraud victim, and as well we add some other information at the end of the file.

identity theft perpetrator putting my address in as two words, and they might miss the E on the end of the second word, or they might drop one of the numbers, or they might flip one of the elements in my social, or they might spell my name S T E W as opposed to S T U.

separate from a consumer-placed fraud alert.

If I could make an addition to One of our actual staff members
wound up becoming the victim of identity theft and she had a lot of problems when she was trying to make her fraud reports because she had to have everything notarized.

score, because we have a notary in our office.
However, this can be quite difficult to someone, especially if they're in a rural environment, or if their bank does not offer free notarization service.

The second thing that I wanted to mention is actually takes one step further back, and I thought it was important to mention, because I didn't -wasn't sure whether it would ever get mentioned anywhere else, and that was brought to mind by what Stuart just said about the Internet.

represented here or do they go to some central source, or do they sometimes just put it on hold and For The Record, Inc.

higher standard than they're currently doing.

FOSTER: I think if you ask ten
creditors that question, you get ten very different answers, but generally we know that they are using at least one of the big three consumer reporting agencies to get credit information, and that's why the fraud alert plays such a vital role in stopping the continuing issuance of credit.
Diane, did you have something? MS. TERRY: Well, it concerns me that some
of the victims have said that the credit grantors are not looking at those, and that's certainly a problem.
That's what that alert is for, it was one
of the first processes that we established to help the consumer victim.
So, the fact that they're not -- that would be a problem.
So, in addition to that, though, day
in and day out, we do get calls from credit grantors that do look at those statements.
We've had some
very successful cases where someone goes to Circuit City or an electronics store and is applying there, and there's an arrest made, you know, right on the For The Record, Inc.

Over here.
MS.
FRANK: I just wanted to get back to the
address change, because that's really the biggest issue.
When a victim finds out that new credit has
been issued to a new address, I mean that's the issue.
Stuart, I know that people move all the time, and the problem seems to be when someone applies for credit in your name, at a different address, and somehow they have all the proper information except the address, and then they get a credit -- they get credit from a credit grantor.
So, I know there's some legislation pending out there to hold creditors and credit reporting agencies accountable.
Who do you think should be
more accountable, the creditor or the credit reporting agency with regard to change of address? I think the real key issue is that when we screamed and hollered a couple of years ago at the For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025

And it seems to me like that's really working very well.
And I would just suggest that
either the creditor be held to that, or the credit reporting agency be held to say someone has applied for credit at a different address, is this truly your address or is it not and clarify with us and update your credit report record.
But the biggest
issue for all of the victims that I think we talk to is there is always a change of address, unless somebody is going to do skimming or a quick bank, you know, quick access to your credit card, but if they're going to establish a whole profile in your name, they're going to get a new address.
And that
is probably, at least in my view, the biggest issue.
So, what do you think about having a notification like Postal authorities have, you know, either Barry or Stuart.

I know the people sent cards have them sent to their office address as well as to their home address, and those records are going to be out there on the file, but if over a period of time, and I think you mentioned that you had been a victim for many years before you found out that that was a problem, if I had applied -- or if you applied for credit at Bank of America and Bank of America looked at this and said gee, there are three accounts out here, or two accounts out here, that are reporting one address, and there's five out here that are reporting another address, and we looked at them and said they don't look like they're a home/work type address, we would be suspicious of that and we would follow up.
So, I think that's one of the things that I would like to see the bureaus look into.
Now, back
directly to your question, okay, your question about notifying people, I believe that's the law in California, starting in is it next July that all address changes to all credit grantors? MS.

We think it's a
good idea to send -- I don't understand why it was defeated.
It sounded like to me like it's a -- it
would be a good law to follow.
MS.
FOSTER: Stuart, do you want to briefly
jump in here and then we have to move on.
MR. PRATT: Yeah, address management, Mari, You're
as a whole, is a part of our discussions.
right, it's both trying to -- I'm not sure, by the way, we're building our databases based on inquiry data coming in, we build our databases based on tape data coming in from the suppliers when the credit account has been opened.
So, we're not just loading in an inquiry, I don't believe, just because the inquiry data is coming in.
So, just to clarify that.
But with regard to address management, it is on the table for continued discussions, but it is part of the competitive world of these big three companies, it's also part of trying to manage the large volume and make sure that you somehow identify the right pattern where it's different and where it it would be a victim's circumstance.
It's out
there, Mari, but it's a big chore working through For The Record, Inc.

MS. TERRY: And, Stuart, if I could add,
again Diane Terry, we have several alerts right now if the input address differs from the one on the file, you know, that alert is given out.
It in
itself alone, you know, it should not be taken as fraud, but it is a red flag that the credit grantors should be looking at it more thoroughly.
Keep in
mind, you know, that many of our consumers use home address, they will use a P.O. box or a work address, a student goes off to school, we may now have a temporary address.
residents.
We have elderly that have two
So, it's very complex, but we are
looking at any way that we can do a better job in assisting the fraud victim.
We have another alert system that mail drops, those are typically used by criminals.
All
of that data is added routinely and daily to our fraud alert system so that again another alert is given out so that the credit grantor can recognize again here's a red flag, take a look at your application, take a look at your consumer.
MR. PRATT: Also, our challenge is to make
sure, and we're actually exploring this with the Postal Service in terms of their system.
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025 For
156 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 example, victims of spousal abuse don't necessarily want a card going back to the previous address saying we know you've moved, is this your new address.
And so then do you send a card that just
says generically we know you've moved, have you changed your address.
And then of course in the
context of fraud, does that just simply spur the perpetrator forward to say I have other identifying elements, so now I can call back to the credit bureau and say well, no, I haven't moved, I am at this old address, here's all of my other identifying information that validates who I am.
So, one of the challenges is to make sure that we're not just thinking we're solving the problem, there may be a difference in behavior between just a generic Postal Service kind of service versus somebody who has economic motivations to continue to perpetrate a crime.
We've got to stop the crime, but we've got to do it with the right tools in place, Mari.
That's one of our challenges right now, and we have heard from individuals that there are concerns like that.
MS.
FOSTER: Regretfully I think we have to
move on to the one-stop shop or we won't get there.

And I want to address this first to the victims on our panel in terms of if you could put in your mind had that been in place at the time that you began dealing with identity theft, can you give us an idea of the importance of that initiative or how it would have helped you, or if it would have helped you.
MR. GREER: helped an awful lot.
solely, no.
In my case I think it would have Would I have depended on that
I've been so proactive in chasing down
all of the different accounts and all of the other issues that I have contacted each of the agencies as well as all the creditors and their companies that have made inquiries on my account.
So I would have
used it just as a third avenue, if you will.
MS.
FOSTER: MR. GRAVES: Eric? I guess if I had known, I would
have put it on immediately, too, but I also wouldn't For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
158 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 have stopped pursuing what other activity was going on, just like he said, and however, maybe if I had applied this alert first off, it would have been more credible to the, you know, reporting agencies, too.
Because when I first started reporting
miscellaneous incorrect data, you know, they did ask for ID, but maybe they wondered why there wasn't any alert on it to begin with.
I mean, maybe there If
should be some procedures internally there, too.
there was a fraud alert, then other things -- it's not good to make assumptions, but at least some things would piece together.
So, I wasn't aware of that, like I mentioned at the prior morning session, that that fraud alert was an option to us, until actually the spring.
And
if it was in the material that was sent, I guess I didn't take it as serious as I thought it should have been, and it wasn't -- I guess regarding all those reports, some of them are text oriented, so as a result you don't know what's important and what's not.
So, you really have to read every word.
And be that as it may, we didn't report it until later, but no other activity was put on during the course of the two years, either, so that was positive.
But if it had been the other way around, For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025

And if there was one place to give all the information and have it put on all three credit agencies, that would have been the way to go, because we had to do different things for all three and it was time consuming.
MS.
FOSTER: MS. ROBINSON: Nicole? Yeah, it would have been
helpful for me, although as I stated before, the fraud alerts didn't do any good.
The victims -- the
criminal, in my case, I'm the victim, the criminal in my case was able to open three other accounts even after the fraud alert was placed on my credit report, but it would have been good for me not to have to spend two and three days just trying to place the initial alert.
MS.
FOSTER: Having heard that, and I would
like to ask the consumer reporting agencies and Barry as well, and the rest of the panel, this is a proposal that has been around for a while.
It was
talked about at least back in March, but perhaps before that at the Identity Theft Summit, and we would like to move forward on it.
We have a
break-out session tomorrow specifically to address the hurdles, and I'm hoping we can identify now in For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
160 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 this session what we're seeing as the hurdles, why haven't we moved further up until now and what can we do now to move further on this important initiative? MR. PRATT: I think I can give you at least
part of the response, and that is that one of our concerns as the consumer reporting industry is that once you have contacted us you have begun triggering a series of duties we have under the law.
And I
don't want to make the law a reason as an -- I don't want to make the law an impediment to doing the right thing, but keep in mind that even in trusting the FTC and saying we're going to do the following, and then the consumer misunderstands and thinks they've submitted their dispute, along with the fraud alert, so now there's more confusion rather than less confusion.
So, keep in mind, what you're suggesting is to re-orient the system away from the first three calls.
Now, we ought to make sure that those calls
get you through quickly and efficiently to the people that you need to speak with.
I think that's
the point that was made very clearly in the first panel.
We've agreed in our initiatives that we will
simply load a -- if you just leave your name and For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025

We have done that because we have heard consumers saying we want to escalate, we want to have assurances certain steps are taken quickly and efficiently.
We don't want to be an impediment, but
we do have certain duties under the law, and it's just difficult for us to know whether cycling through the FTC, consumers will assume our duties to have been triggered at a particular point or not.
MS.
FOSTER: Well, the FTC, speaking on
behalf of my own organization, has a long history of consumer education.
I think we could take up that
challenge of making sure that when consumers call us, as we do now, that they get the right story and they understand what the process is, if we could get the process in place to work.
The second thing that you mentioned is something we wanted to talk about on the fraud alerts and didn't get to, but if you are placing an automatic fraud alert, if you're calling as you're For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025

MS. BENNER: I think something that would
help that is just to get a live person on the phone when you call a credit bureau.
A lot of victims
that I have spoken to say I go through, you know, number after number and I enter all my information, I don't know what happened because I'm not talking to anybody, any real person, and while I think one-stop shopping is a wonderful idea, I understand there are problems with funding that sort of a system.
I think the first step is definitely just
to make sure that the credit bureaus always have a live person on the phone to deal with victims once they call.
MR. McKEE: I would like to agree with that.
When we had the one member of our staff that tried to go through the process, she was pretty specific when I was brainstorming with my other staff members For The Record, Inc.

And she found that to
be very confusing, very difficult, even though we give out information, we have brochures about identity theft.
So, though she doesn't work specifically on the fraud issue, she had ready access to all of the information about what she should be doing.
herself had a problem caused by the lack of communication, and the inability to make a direct contact with anyone except at Experian.

MR. GREER: I was in a situation where just You do not get a live person at
this last August, my -- the whole ID theft began for me in March of '99.
In August of this year, I tried
to get all new accounts from all of the -- all new reports from each of the agencies, and I don't remember which one it was, but they've got an automated system where you enter in your address and For The Record, Inc.

Well, the fraudulent address was in as my current address, and I could not talk to a real person, and I was asked to leave a voice mail message with all of my personal identification, which I will not do, but what I did leave is my phone number at home and at work and said that those numbers matched the numbers on my security alert, please call me.
It's a way of verification.
I got nothing.
My call was totally ignored.
Ended up searching for a few hours and making dozens of phone calls and I ended up going in through some of the business offices down in I think it was Georgia, and I got transferred and I just worked my way through until I got somebody that could actually help me out.
They grilled me, which is the whole purpose of the fraud alerts in the first place, and when they finally said, I mean they're asking -- not only -- one of the accounts, they asked when I obtained it.
They wanted a month, day and year.
On the card I haven't
itself, you have the month and the year.
a clue what day you get a credit card, and I doubt that there's any person here that can say that.

The person on the phone finally said the
reason I'm putting you through this grilling is the address isn't matching, and then it clicked, and I said okay, if the address isn't matching, you either have this one, that one, this one, or the other one.
And I heard on the other end of the phone yeah, yeah, yeah, my real address was four or five addresses down, and once I got that established, everything was very well established and worked through.
But -- getting through that stage is very,
very difficult.
MS.
FOSTER: I wanted to give Maxine and
Robin a chance to jump in here and respond.
MS. HOLLAND: What we at Equifax really
believe, we understand how difficult it is for fraud victims to go through and do everything that they need to do, and so what we do is give a special number to credit grantors, so if the consumer has notified the creditor grantor before anyone else, the credit grantor can give them an 800 number that allows them to speak to a live person.
It is not a
long BRU system, it says you can give an alert or press 2 for a live body.

I
think it's getting better, but are we where we need to be? Absolutely not.
And we want to work
together, because not one entity is responsible for identity theft, and not one identity is going to solve it alone.
We must, must, must work together.
I would like to suggest, though,
MR. McKEE:
that that number not be given to the credit grantors, but should be made more publicly available.
Many times consumers are getting turned
down for credit, that's when they request the credit report and discover that oh, my God, I don't have all -- I didn't have all of these accounts, I didn't request all of this stuff.
But the credit grantor,
when they turned them down, didn't realize it was a case of identity theft, the credit grantor turned them down because they had too much credit.
And so
this phone number isn't making it to the consumers.
MR. PRATT: Well, when the consumer has been
declined and if they have gotten their file, then they do get a number with live personnel available, so at that point they do have live personnel.
MR. McKEE: But often --

solution, Philip, I'm just saying it's a question of let's make sure that we know in the right order when a consumer has acces to personnel.
MR. McKEE: I agree, but unfortunately the
live personnel at the dispute, at that line for when the person gets turned down for credit, are not always the best trained on ID theft.
And we do
have, we have heard lots of problems on that, because they get told, they're telling me this is my credit problem, it's not my credit problem, my credit has been stolen.
And they are not getting to
the right place in the reporting bureau.
MS. TERRY: If I can add to that, at Trans
Union, we have been working in credit fraud many years, but in 1992, we actually had a group of dedicated associates that are familiar with that type of crime, and very familiar, deal with it day in and day out.
We have 800 lines that go into this
unit that over 100 associates that are there to talk to consumers.
Further, to, you know, we certainly are looking at any way that we can assist the consumer victims in a better, more accurate way, but right now, we do feel, and I'm convinced of it even more For The Record, Inc.

MR. GRAVES: MS.
FOSTER: MR. GRAVES: Could I interject something? Sure.
In terms of that, my son was
turned down for credit for a used car loan, and it was turned down by Trans Union, that was the credit reporting agency that Lockheed had used at the time, but we couldn't get to any people, you know, it was all still a menu driven thing, and because that's the time that we first got notified of this, and he was only 19 at the time.
Granted, I'm sure that
your databases don't really check on age, but, you know, why didn't we -- this goes back to address changes, why didn't we get notification of this spurious address in Georgia where there wouldn't have been any traces for that social security number, or why didn't we get any kind of notification that I was listed as my son's spouse.
You know, some of these kind of things would just be a little proactive to help in eliminating some of these things.

automated, and the good news of that is that it makes our number available 365 days a year, you know, seven days a week, 24 hours a day kind of thing.
We, too, recognize that we still need to
improve the access, especially when the automated system fails.
But I would also point out -- well,
another point is that we only have the one number, so no matter where you get referred to us, you will always have the fraud option or the option for all the different situations that you might -- why you might be contacting us.

Oh, the
other point I wanted to make is in terms of one-stop shopping and how do people know and why do they only have an alert on one file.

have mentioned that we send out advice and information and tips to victims, and that's part of the information that we provide is to refer victims to the other two credit reporting companies so that they do know that they should contact them and get alerts on as well.

person to perpetrate things where they've gotten credit and don't want to pay for it type of things, and also, how much have they found collusion with the credit grantors in putting phony applications, let's say, through in order to gain credit for someone else on that side as to finding out that the actual, let's say loan company or jewelry store or something, employee is doing it.

to help with the effort to educate law enforcement about the need to issue police reports and about the need to investigate the crime and what are some of the criminal statutes that are out there on the books today.

it's a great suggestion, that if we can work in our fraud areas to make sure that we're asking for the same information and there's consistency there, that seems to be exactly why we have this task force in place within our industry.

he was applying for a mortgage on a second home, and this friend of his who was a banker had said this fellow is on your credit report.

FOSTER: So, your question is at what
point does a consumer get notified of -MS. NEWHOUSE: Right, and should there be
some responsibility if the person who picked it up, I mean there was -- that would have -- it was a mistake, it started as a mistake, and somehow their credit reports were merged, yet this person who had -- was the one with the good credit and the other one had very bad credit, was never notified by anyone that it had happened, even though they didn't even have the same last name.
They did not have the
same last name, the same spouse, the same date of birth or the same address.
MS.
FOSTER: I think this takes us a little
further afield from identity theft into what the bureaus I know refer to as a mixed file problem, which is something that they work on and have different processes to identify those types of For The Record, Inc.

Do any of you want to speak to that? Yeah, I would think that sounds
MS. TERRY:
like someone with very similar identifying information but not credit fraud as we're talking here on identity theft.
MS. NEWHOUSE: But whatever the notification
process would be would be the same type of notification process that should apply to an identity theft victim.
MS.
FOSTER: It's a little different,
because usually the onus is on the consumer when they discover that they are a victim of identity theft to identify that to a consumer reporting agency, which may not necessarily know that this information is anomalous or they think that one person has several addresses or that kind of thing.
So, it is a little different in the respect that if it's not, you know, a fraud situation where a consumer has been notified by multiple creditors that there are multiple fraudulent accounts, that the consumer is usually the first person to know.
So, they are the ones on the front lines saying to the consumer reporting agencies, this is a problem.

Before we start that, though, I Just a
just wanted to mention a couple of things.
couple people said that a lot of this is about raising awareness of what's happening, and I wanted on that subject to make sure that everybody was aware of the brochure that's in your pamphlet that you received this morning When Bad Things Happen To Your Good Name.
This is something that we at the FTC have handed out to ID theft victims and that other institutions have also handed out to ID theft victims, and we just want to emphasize this is available to be reprinted and be handed out by your organization.
We can get you copies, Photo Ready or
on ZIP Drive to get copies made, and we would suggest this is a really helpful first step to provide to the victims, and I just wanted to make sure that we didn't fail to mention that.

The earlier
panel this morning addressed the issues with credit reports, cleaning up erroneous reports and other mischief left by the identity thief.
We're now going to go a little bit earlier For The Record, Inc.

Our consumer
education material that Hugh referred to advises consumers to do three things immediately upon discovering that they're victims of identity theft: First, contact the three major consumer reporting agencies; second, contact each of the creditors or other entities where a fraudulent account was opened or where your identity was corrupted; and finally to file a police report.
We're going to focus on the second and third of these issues this afternoon and ask if currently these practices are accomplishing all that they can.
As to the creditors, are they gathering all of the necessary information? user friendly? Are their practices
Can it be made easier for the
consumer, and are there opportunities to expand the use of the information that is given by the consumers? We're not the first to ask these questions about streamlining and to suggest that there are easier ways of reporting identity theft to creditors and financial institutions.

other folks have had this for a few days and have given some clear time and thoughtful attention to this document, and so in the second half of this afternoon's session, we'll go through this model fraud affidavit and talk about what it does, what it doesn't do.
We take no pride in ownership, although a lot of work has gone into, thanks to Helen Foster, but what we do in this process is look to fraud affidavits that are currently being used and to lift out information that appears to us to be critical for the financial institutions and try to trim that down, consolidate, and we would look to you for your comments and hopefully and ultimately your buy-in to For The Record, Inc.

would fill out this one form, attach their supporting documentation and send it to everyone.
But let's talk about the other point here which is reporting to law enforcement, which is very important.
We heard about it this morning.
What is They
law enforcement doing to take these complaints? What are they doing with the information that they receive from victims? reporting this fraud? Can they help victims in What are police best
practices in dealing with victims of ID theft, and what about law enforcement that still does not see a consumer as the victim of ID theft but still focuses only on the financial institution that may have assumed most of the financial loss? I'm confident that we can address and make meaningful progress on these issues in the next two hours or so.
We have representatives from -- key
stakeholders in this discussion, from banks, from creditors, law enforcement, and we also have the guidance from victims, from consumer advocates and others in this area.
So to this point I would like to introduce For The Record, Inc.

Is there anyone between him and Shannon McCallum? Yes, Debra North, a victim of identity

Next to her
sits Shannon McCallum from Travelocity.COM who has taken a lot of initiatives to address ID theft as it affects his industry, and next to him Robert Cross joining us from National City Bank.
What I would like to do, as I mentioned, is hold off on our discussion of the fraud affidavit until the second half.

I would like this panel to be as conversational as possible.
I would like to see
interaction between the members, to the extent we want to hear from you in the audience as well, but I would ask for the audience to more or less hold off until we can sort of develop a momentum on our own on this panel.
So I would like first to start out and ask the question generally, and I think among -directed mostly to our creditors sitting on the panel of what you found to be best practices that have been adopted by your company for taking fraud reports and proving the fraud for identity theft victims and maybe, Barry, I will open up with you.
MR. SMITH: I would be glad to.
We see
disputes about identity theft and fraud applications coming in from several different ways.
The most
common seems to come in from our collection folks, when they place a call to somebody and say, "Where's our payment," the people that can't make a payment turn around and say, "I don't think I ever applied for that card, that's not my transactions, I'm not responsible for them."
For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
186 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Well, we've wrestled with this within the bank going back and forth about just what do we do.
Here's a dispute.
How do we resolve it as quickly
as possible and get back on track doing the day's business and yet handling things correctly for the consumer? The process we came up with is we pull a copy of the application.
We attach a questionnaire
to it, and we send it to the customer with a letter that says, Please review the application, comment in the questionnaire about the information on the application, send it back to us within 30 days, and if you read the application and you recognize the information as being yours, then you don't have to go through the problem of sending it back.
30 days
later we'll resume collection efforts so we will expect that you will have started to pay your bill.
We found this process to be very well received by our customers, and we get back a tremendous amount of investigative information.
People tell us that they did live at that address.
They tell us the name of the people.
this may be an ex significant other.
They tell us It may be a
friend that lived with them for a little period of time that's gone out and applied for credit in their For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025

In a lot of cases they just own up to the fact that -- or don't really come back to us and tell us, but they just accept the fact that the application is really theirs.
60 percent of the documents that we send out this way are just accepted by the consumer, so that means that more than 50 percent of the people that are telling us on the phone that they don't recognize the account, they have nothing to do with the account, once they see the application, they accept responsibility for it.
Now, of the people that send it back to us and say, "I had no part of that, however here's the person that did," this is still a fraud application, and they are usually pretty happy to tell us how we can get in touch with that person, especially if there's been a relationship in the past and they know where that person is today.
Once we get that information, then we can either go set up a billing account for the second person.
We can start collection efforts with them.
We can clear the bureau for the primary person that's on the application if in fact they had nothing to do with it, and everybody can get back to For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025
188 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 their normal business.
In the cases that we get the dispute back and then proceed to find the other person to get them to take responsibility for the application or the debt, about 50 percent of the ones that are returned to us, we actually find the other person and resume collection efforts with that other person, so that kind of skinnies the number down quite a bit.
The other place where we get our applications are, of course, just normal consumer disputes coming to us because they found something on the credit bureau, and they've contacted us.
those cases we do the same thing.
In
We pull a copy of
the application, send it to them with the questionnaire, and we get back a tremendous amount of leads and information also through that source.
So I think that if there's something that Bank of America feels that they're doing right in regard to this dispute process, it's just this because we are giving the people the information, and we're letting them make the decision about whether or not it's fraud.
MR. FISHMAN: I want to commend Bank of
America for that practice because I think you're the For The Record, Inc.
Waldorf, Maryland (301) 870-8025

Most of my clients have a very hard time
getting the application when they ask for it when they've been a victim, and often that can clear up the problem very early on, and I think Bank of America may be the exception in that area as opposed to certain other banks.
MR. SMITH: this question: Thank you.
But let me ask you
If you can't provide the
application, then how can you continue with collecting the debt? MR. FISHMAN: issue that they can't.
I don't know that it's an It's that they won't, and I
don't know why they won't because it seems to me that your rationale of giving the application is a sound one, and it should be one of the first responses when somebody says, Fraudulent activity or not my account because often I've seen -- finally sometimes it takes litigation to get the application.
And when I see that application in litigation, I say, "Well, they didn't even spell my client's name right, and if we had gotten that application long ago, we could have cleared this up long ago and we wouldn't be in this lawsuit now."
MS. BRODER: Let's see what the other

Patsy, am I
right, to SBC Services, what is your process? MS. RAMOS: We're a telecommunications
company, and our process differs depending on what region.
Currently we've used the opportunity of
merging companies over the last few years to go in and take a look to what the existing processes are in each of the regions and to try to pull out of there what is best practice.
And what we're aiming to do is to reengineer the process to take in what we learn from the work being done here and to centralize the claim handling for all of the three regions.
So what do we do today? Basically, although
the processes differ, when we get a customer that calls us to tell us that they have no knowledge of the telephone debt on their account, we ask them to provide proof of residency during that period of time.
We do ask them in the states where they can
place a police report to do that, and we ask them to sign the affidavit, send it to us so that we can exonerate them from the debt.
MS. BRODER: Do you provide them with copies
of the application for the account or any of the documentation about the account? For The Record, Inc.

think it's probably typical for the telecommunications industry that the service application is done over the phone, and it's not done in person.
MR. FISHMAN: MS. RAMOS: MR. FISHMAN: MS. RAMOS: Sometimes there's a tape No tape.
-over the phone.
--
No, no tape, and so there is no
application to provide the customer, and it also brings up a question that we're kind of struggling with right now.
When a customer comes to us and
says that I have no knowledge of this account or we identify that they're serviced to a different address and they become aware of this, they want the information regarding that fraudulent account to try to understand where was the service installed, what was the telephone number.
And we're struggling with whether or not -because of privacy issues and also because of risks of whether or not that's information that we want to provide to the victim of identity theft, our concern is that they may want to go by there and confront the person which could be a problem.

MS. BRODER: I'm going to ask people, we're
kind of squeezed in here, but we need both mikes in order to be picked up.
How long was the process for
those banks or entities that had good practices and got back to you? MR. GENERA: The first three legitimately
went away -- I believe we notified in November, they went away by January or February, so three -- about two or three months.
Average for the good guys were
about six months, and the worse one that did go completely away was about a year and a half maybe.
MS. BRODER: And Debra, I know that this is
a fairly recent occurrence for you, but were there any times where you called a bank or creditors and you said that they were very responsive, and you could describe what some of those practices were For The Record, Inc.

NORTH: Right.
It's only been two and a
half months, so I don't think I've given it enough time to get the complete response, but the customer service department is friendly enough and they take your information, but as far as forwarding you to a fraud department and finding out that they're actually following up with it, I had one creditor who took the information and said they would take care of it, and I said, Please send me a letter confirming this discussion.
And they sent me a letter, but they addressed it to the other person, so that was upsetting, and it just continues to -- I don't think they really get the picture or listen to the story sometimes, and I think the fraud department and these institutions could really be worked on.
MS. BRODER: on best practice? Were there any other thoughts James.
Yes, one that I think you
MR. FISHMAN:
touched on briefly is whether you get hooked up to somebody in the customer service department or the fraud department makes all the difference in the world, but one thing I hear all the time from clients is that every time they have to call in, For The Record, Inc.

For some of the people who have maybe the more severe cases, I don't know, but if they were assigned a fraud assistance person in the fraud department who knew their problem from the beginning and they didn't have to go over it every time, who they could get a direct line to and not have to be on hold for 20 minutes or so, that would go a long way even just to give the consumer a sense that they are helping them and not feeling like just a number.
MS. BRODER: about that? MR. CROSS: Well, we have a distinct Robert Cross, what do you think
advantage of being a relatively small credit card issuer with several million credit card accounts, and we do that.
We assign a case worker in every
case that comes up, and they work the case and work with the consumers.
They also have affidavits customized for each type of fraud.

MS. BRODER: MS. FOLEY: MS. BRODER: MS. FOLEY: Let's talk about that.
May I jump in for a minute? Please do, Linda.
Linda Foley, and besides being a
victim advocate, I'm also a victim of identity theft.
For those who don't know, my employer stole
my identity.
The information I gave her in terms of employment was what she took and used to buy her credit cards and cell phones.
I found out quickly because Citibank VISA called and wanted to confirm a change of address which got me on the process.
The only way I found
out who was doing it and I found out so rapidly was I was able to get an application form from First USA. that was how I could point to the person who
did it.
The police were out there with a search warrant within three weeks.
It did end in
conviction, and she was eventually -- she is a convicted felon now out on probation unfortunately.
You would always like to see more, but the idea of getting an application, and we're going back to that again, is so important.
The one group that I couldn't get an For The Record, Inc.

It's almost
easier to get an application form, whether it was given by telephone, by the Internet or by mail, from a credit card company than it is any company in the telecommunications industry, so that is a concern.
I do think they need to see those application forms.
First USA did have someone who When I had problems, I

simply called back that exact same person, and I said, Hi, it's Linda Foley again, I've got a problem.
They pulled up my file, and I didn't have
to spend ten minutes explaining the whole thing again.
I have a sheet back there, and I think we need directed victim assistance personnel all the way down the line from the credit card companies, the credit reporting industry, the CRAs, law enforcement.

been? MR. FISHMAN: Once you get the -- just How successful have those litigations
looking from a problem solving perspective, once you get that document and you say, Here's the signature, it doesn't match, it isn't even close, they didn't even spell the name of my client correctly, so the chances that a court is going to find that my client is the one who opened this account is pretty slim, and those cases tend to get resolved.
But as I said before, it shouldn't have to go that distance.
I'm sure that -- as an attorney I
try to avoid litigation, I really do, because it's very often not in my client's interest either, but I find that I am often forced as the only -- the only way I can go to solve the problem is to go that route when my client has tried and failed and I've tried and failed.
And it does raise another problem, which I want to mention, which is as an attorney we -- as the FTC has said that we are covered by the Credit For The Record, Inc.

So that's something that would make it a lot easier for lawyers to help consumers who have been unable to do it themselves.
MS. BRODER: Thank you.
I think I want to
open this up a little more for our law enforcement participants too and to talk for a little bit about the balance between making it easy for consumers to report fraud but also making certain that they are bona fide victims and not simply people trying to get out of debt.
So I think this actually encompasses all of us, whether law enforcement and private industry and our victims on the panel, but I would ask, Jim, if you have some thoughts on that and taking reports.

to try to do the same thing that the banks and everybody else are doing, and that is look to some identification and things of that nature.
If you have good false identification documents, passports, things like that, you could probably scam most of the police officers out here to a certain degree, so we're not the total answer, and why the bank would require a police report when the bank's not going to get a scope of the police report, they just want the number.
I've been doing it for 21 years.
I've
gotten five requests from the bank regarding those reports, so why they want a number, I don't know, For The Record, Inc.

I personally believe that I

around talking on a telephone and asking if the bank has gotten an affidavit of forgery, whether you've sent us an affidavit of forgery and how many different credit cards were compromised, it really doesn't matter to me, the law enforcement officer, because I want to catch the bad guy.

question, this is open both for law enforcement and the credit providers, credit grantors.

me when we're talking about ID theft, that there are two crimes going on here.
You have the identity
theft and that fraud in and of itself which is a crime against me.
But it seems to me the greater crime to times is going to be against the credit granter, okay.
