A Message from Attorney General Tom Miller [miller.gif] Dear fellow Iowans The goal of this brochure is to help you if you are a victim of "identity theft."
Identity theft occurs when someone obtains important personal information, such as your Social Security number, banking or credit card account numbers, to commit fraud or theft
"Identity thieves" commit a kind of financial sabotage.
They use people's personal information to open fraudulent credit card accounts, rob retirement earnings, siphon money out of people's accounts, or commit other kinds of fraud.
The Consumer Protection Division of my office has developed this guide to provide you with information and steps to take if you are a victim; whom to contact, what to say, where to write or call, how to repair your credit record, and how to avoid future problems.
I am very sorry if you have been victimized by identity theft, and I sincerely hope the information in this guide will help you.
I encourage you to contact my office if we can provide any more information.
Please write to the Consumer Protection Division, Hoover Building, Des Moines, Iowa 50319, or call 515-281-5926.
With best wishes,
[tjmsig.gif]

Attorney General of Iowa
A Guide for Victims of Identity Theft
Identity theft crimes are on the rise, causing nationwide concern.
Your personal identifying information can be accessed in an increasing variety of ways.
An imposter can misuse your information to open fraudulent credit card accounts, secure deposits on cars and housing, obtain employment opportunities, create insurance benefits, and rob retirement earnings.
This form of financial sabotage can devastate your credit and require endless hours of telephone and written communication to resolve.
In the meantime, you may experience difficulty writing checks, obtaining loans, renting apartments, and even getting hired.
This guide provides victims of identity theft with clear and concise information, and the major resources to contact to resolve the conflicts which remain long after the thief disappears.
Unfortunately, the responsibility of identifying and resolving the consequences of identity theft is left largely to the victims themselves.
It is important to act quickly and assertively to minimize the damage to your credit reputation.
While identity theft is a "crime" which law enforcement officials can prosecute, the perpetrator is often difficult to track.
In addition, law enforcement officials cannot clean up the havoc created for you.
In dealing with the authorities and financial institutions, keep a log of all conversations, including dates, names, and telephone numbers.
Keep notes on the time spent and any expenses incurred.
Confirm all conversations in writing.
Send correspondence by certified mail (return receipt requested).
Keep copies of all letters and documents.

1.
Credit Bureaus Immediately call the fraud units of the three credit reporting companies -- CSC Credit Services (Equifax Regional Office), Experian (formerly TRW), and Trans Union.
Report the theft of your credit cards or misuse of your account numbers.
Request that your credit account be flagged.
Also, add a victim's statement (up to 100 words) to your report, such as: "My identification has been used to apply for fraudulent credit.
Contact me at [your telephone number or mailing address] to verify ALL applications."
Be sure to ask how long the fraud alert is posted on your credit account, and how you can extend it if necessary.
Be aware that these measures may not entirely stop fraudulent new accounts from being opened by the identity thief.
Ask the credit bureaus, in writing, to provide you with copies every few months so you can monitor your credit report.
Upon your request, a credit bureau is required to provide you with one free credit report during any 12-month period if you have reason to believe the report contains inaccurate information due to fraud.
Additional credit reports shall not exceed an $8.00 charge and this fee is often waived.
(15 United States Code section 1682j(c)(3))
Request the credit bureaus, in writing, to provide you the names and phone numbers of credit grantors with whom fraudulent accounts have been opened.
Request the credit bureaus, in writing, to remove inquiries that have been generated due to the fraudulent access.
Request that all fraudulent information and inquiries be permanently removed from your credit report.
You may also request the credit bureaus to notify those who have received your credit report in the last six months in order to alert them to the disputed and erroneous information (two years for employers).

2.
Creditors Contact all creditors immediately with whom your name has been used fraudulently -- by telephone and in writing.
Get replacement cards with new account numbers for your own accounts that have been used fraudulently.
Ask that old accounts be processed as "account closed at consumer's request."
This is better than "card lost or stolen," because when this statement is reported to credit bureaus, it can be interpreted as blaming you for the loss.
Carefully monitor your mail and credit card statements for evidence of new fraudulent activity.
Report it immediately to credit grantors.
Victims of unauthorized use of a credit card will be liable for no more than the first $50 of the loss, although this is often waived and victim will not be required to pay any part of the loss.
(15 United States Code section 1643)
Request the credit grantor to provide you with a copy of the fraudulent credit application and a statement of the incurred charges.
Such information may be helpful in disputing the application and/or charges as fraudulent.
If the credit grantor resists providing you this information, contact your local police or sheriff's department for assistance.
The credit grantor should readily provide such information when requested to do so by local law enforcement authorities.
Pay particular attention to what personal identifying information the identity thief has provided on the application and note any discrepancies that may exist.
When reviewing the charges, note the date of the purchases, where the purchases were made and what type of products or services were purchased.
Look for dates, places or items which contradict your own schedule, whereabouts, and even tastes.
Credit requirements to verify fraud You may be asked by banks or credit grantors to fill out and notarize fraud affidavits, which could become costly.
The law does NOT require that a notarized affidavit be provided to banks or creditors.
A written statement and supporting documentation should be enough (unless the bank or creditor offer to pay for the notary).
Overly burdensome requirements by banks or creditors should be reported to the government authority which regulates the credit card issuer.
To determine which authority regulates the particular credit card issuer in question, contact:
Iowa Department of Commerce Banking Division 200 E. Grand Suite 300 Des Moines, IA 50309 Phone: 515-281-4014
3.
Law Enforcement Report the crime to all police and sheriff's departments with jurisdiction in your case.
Give them as much documented evidence as possible.
Get a copy of your police report.
Keep the telephone number of your fraud investigator handy and give it to creditors and others who require certification of your case.
Banks and credit card companies may require you to produce the police report in order to verify the crime.
4.
Stolen Checks If you have had checks stolen or bank accounts set up fraudulently, report it to the check verification companies listed below.
Put stop payments on any outstanding checks that you are unsure of.
Cancel your checking and savings accounts and obtain new account numbers.
Give the bank a secret password for your account.
When creating a password, don't use common numbers like the last four digits of your Social Security number, your birthdate, middle name, mother's maiden name, pet's name, address, consecutive numbers, or anything else that could easily be discovered by thieves.

Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) Cards If your ATM card has been stolen or compromised, get a new card, account number and password.
Do not use your old password or the common passwords and personal identification numbers listed above.
6.
Fraudulent Change of Address, Mail Theft, or Other Mail Involvement Notify the U.S. Postal Inspector's Office for Iowa if you suspect an identity thief has filed a change of address with the post office or has used the mail to commit bank or credit fraud.
Theft of mail is a felony.
Find out where the fraudulent credit cards were sent.
Notify the local Postmaster for that address to forward all mail in your name to your own address.
You may also need to talk with the local mail carrier for that address as well.
U.S. Postal Inspectors P.O. Box 566 Des Moines, IA 50309 Phone: 515-253-9060
7.
Secret Service Jurisdiction The Secret Service investigates crimes dealing with credit card fraud, financial institution fraud, and crimes dealing with the false use of personal identifiers (such as name, date of birth, or Social Security number) relating to financial crimes.
However, the Secret Service usually does not investigate individual cases unless the dollar amount is high or you are one of many victims of a fraud ring.
If the actual crime (fraudulent application or charges) occurred outside of Iowa, the Secret Service may forward your case to the appropriate office.
U.S. Secret Service 210 Walnut Street Des Moines, IA 50309 Phone: 515-284-4565
8.
Social Security Number Misuse To determine is someone is misusing your Social Security number for employment purposes, order a copy of your Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) from the Social Security Administration to check for inaccuracies or fraud.
To request a PEBES application call or write to the office listed below.
Once you have determined that there are too many or too few earnings are recorded on your PEBES, or if your name is recorded incorrectly, call or write to:
Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General 210 Walnut Street Des Moines, IA 50309 Phone: 800-772-1213 515-284-4345 website to download a PEBES application: http://www.ssa.gov
If some is misusing your Social Security number, as a last resort, you may consider changing your number.
The Social Security Administration will change your number only if you fit specific fraud victim criteria.
For more information, call or write the office listed below and request the fact sheet, Social Security: When Someone Misuses Your Social Security Number, SSA Pub. No. 05-10064.
Report the fraudulent use of your Social Security number to:
Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General P.O. Box 17768 Baltimore, MD 21235 Phone: 800-772-1213 Phone: 800-269-0271 (OIG Fraud/Waste/Abuse Hotline) e-mail: oig.hotline@ssa.gov
9.
Income Tax Fraud Any fraudulent use of another person's Social Security number, including dependents' Social Security numbers, to obtain an income tax refund should be reported to:
Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division P.O. Box 7909, Stop 9000 Shawnee Mission, KS 66207-7909 Phone: 800-829-0433
10.
Passports If you are the victim of identity theft and have a passport, notify the passport office, in writing, to be on the lookout for anyone ordering a new passport fraudulently.
U.S. Postal Service Passport Acceptance Unit 1165 - 2nd Avenue, Room 228 Des Moines, IA 50318-9802 Phone: 515-283-7509
11.
Utilities If your cellular phone or long distance calling card has been stolen or if you discover fraudulent charges on your bills, cancel the accounts and open new ones.
To avoid being "slammed," request that your local telephone service "freeze" your long distance carrier so it cannot be changed without specific authorization using a password.
To avoid being "crammed," scrutinize every charge on your billing statements for fraudulent or unauthorized charges.
Notify your gas, electric, water, and trash utilities that you are a victim of identity theft and alert them to the possibility that the thief may try to establish accounts using your personal information.
12.
Driver's License Number Misuse You may need to change your driver's license number if someone is using yours fraudulently.
Call the Iowa Department of Transportation's Motor Vehicle Information Center and verify the last issuance date of your license.
If there is a discrepancy and you have a non-commercial driver's license, go to your local driver's license station and apply for a duplicate license with an "assigned" number.
Commercial drivers will be unable to use an "assigned" number, but should contact the Motor Vehicle Enforcement Office to file a fraud report.
Send a letter, complete with supporting documents, requesting a fraud investigation to:
Iowa Motor Vehicle Enforcement P.O. Box 10473 Des Moines, IA 50306-0473 Phone: 515-237-3221
13.
False Civil and Criminal Judgments Sometimes victims of identify theft are wrongfully accused of crimes committed by the imposter.
If a civil judgment has been entered against you for actions taken by your imposter, contact the court where the judgment was entered and report that you are a victim of identify theft.
If you are wrongfully prosecuted for criminal charges, contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Ask how to clear your name.
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation 3737 Woodland Avenue West Des Moines, IA 50266 Phone: 515-223-4278 If no answer call Omaha, NE 402-493-8688
14.
Credit Report Fraud If you find that there has been unauthorized access or use of your credit report, the Federal Trade Commission will be able to advise you of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
Call or write to:
Federal Trade Commission Consumer Response Center Washington, DC 20580 Phone: 202-326-3761 Phone: 202-326-3128
15.
Insurance Coverage You may want to consult with your insurance agent to determine whether your losses may be covered by household or other insurance policies.
16.
Legal Help You may want to consult with a private attorney to determine legal action to take against creditor grantors and/or credit bureaus if they are not cooperative in removing fraudulent entries from your credit report or if negligence is a factor.
An attorney can help you recover from the fraud and determine whether your rights under various credit, banking, Social Security, and other laws have been violated.
The Iowa State Bar Association will provide you with the name of one attorney in your area that handles consumer protection issues.
If you should decide to consult with the attorney to whom you were referred, this service ensures that you will not be charged more than $25.00 for the first half hour consultation.
Call or write to:

17.
Making Changes New laws regarding right to privacy issues and fraud victim assistance programs are currently being drafted and proposed at the federal and state levels of government.
If you are disappointed with the privacy protection and fraud assistance available under current laws, consider writing your federal and state legislators concerning your experience.
18.
Don't Give In Remember, you are not responsible for any bill, portion of a bill, or checks written or cashed which result from identity theft.
Your credit rating should not be permanently affected, and no legal action should be taken against you.
If any merchant, financial institution or collection agency suggests otherwise, simply restate your willingness to cooperate, but don't allow yourself to be coerced into paying a fraudulent debt.
Many victims of identity theft report feeling angry, frustrated, powerless, and even violated.
If these feelings persist or become overwhelming, talk to your friends, family members, or a counselor.
