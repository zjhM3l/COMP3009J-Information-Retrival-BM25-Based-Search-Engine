FEDERAL RESOURCES In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the U.S. Congress unanimously approved September 14 and President Bush signed into law September 18 an emergency supplemental appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001 that will provide $40 billion for disaster and recovery assistance and anti-terrorism initiatives.
The disaster response package will make funds available to federal, state, and local preparedness for mitigating and responding to the attacks; to support counter, investigate, or prosecute domestic or international terrorism; to provide increased transportation security; to repair public facilities and transportation systems damaged by the attacks; and to support national security.

During an October 4, 2001 hearing on transit safety, leaders of the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee pledged support in boosting public transportation agency safety and security.
Subcommittee ranking member Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo) said that as aircraft become more difficult to attack, public transportation facilities, which carry large numbers of people along predictable routes, could become the next target.
Members had a general consensus that transit should become a permanent key component in evacuation plans of cities nationwide.
Federal Transit Administrator Jennifer L. Dorn outlined several important Federal Transit Administration (FTA) activities underway to assist transit agency preparedness and emergency response.
These include the distribution of security toolkits containing resources designed to improve transit security; assistance for agencies in conducting vulnerability assessments and refining emergency response plans; and workshops on these issues.
Moreover, the agency plans to expand their emergency response training.
(Source: "Senate Panel Pledges Support to Enhance Transit Safety, Security", Passenger Transport, Vol. 59, No. 41, October 15, 2001).
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) The FTA maintains a web site that addresses transit safety and security issues.
(See the FTA Safety and Security web site at http://transit-safety.volpe.dot.gov.)
Materials created by the Office of Safety and Security can help transit agencies develop their security plans and establish security procedures.
The following excerpts are from the web site.
Safety and Security Program The Federal Transit Administration's Safety and Security Program goal is to promote public health and safety by working toward the elimination of transit-related deaths, injuries, property damage and the improvement of personal security and property protection.
This is accomplished through the promotion of transit safety and security in the transit community.
FTA encourages transit systems to collect and disseminate data on safety and security issues,
1
identify and implement best practices, and develop and implement comprehensive system safety and security program plans covering passengers, transit agency personnel, vehicles, and facilities.
FTA participates in a number of intermodal U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) efforts to develop safety and security strategies that promote national transportation interests.
In partnership with the transit industry, national security agencies, and international transportation organizations, FTA continues to test and evaluate advanced technologies (including chemical and biological detection systems) to reduce transit crime and counter terrorism targeted at transit patrons, employees and facilities.
The main focus areas of the Safety and Security Program are Railroad Safety, Information Systems Security, Crime Prevention and Anti-Terrorism and Intelligent Vehicle Initiative.
Crime Prevention and Anti-Terrorism Program (http://www.fta.dot.gov/research/safe/crimeprev/crimeprev.htm) Through this program, the Federal Transit Administration will demonstrate innovative security technologies, system design, and rail and bus vehicle security enhancements.
Consistent with the recommendations of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, the FTA will identify possible key terrorist targets in transit and evaluate the economic consequences of disruption to transit service in those markets.
Core systems that may be vulnerable to terrorist acts will need to develop fail-safe interventions.
The FTA will explore other options to improve transit security.
Specific actions will include accessing transit vulnerabilities, examining current transit systems' terrorism prevention programs, identifying technologies, developing procedures, and providing appropriate recommendations to enhance transit security.
Of particular importance will be a risk assessment of the range of transportation services at airports served by rapid transit lines.
The FTA will also develop a computer model for application in field operations that simulates the transit environment, including medical triage, contingency transit, emergency evacuation routes, and vulnerable locations points, which will aid security personnel in responding to catastrophic transit events.
Selected activities under this program include: Development of an advanced multi-sensor system that incorporates full data fusion: The goal of this program will be to tie together ten or fewer Urban Chemical Release Detector (UCRD) multi-sensor detector instruments that will be installed in a variety of locations within a subway station.
The use of this system will result in a significant reduction in the false alarm rate without a concurrent degradation of high probability of detection.
The proposed fully integrated system will use a flexible modular architecture so that other instruments and detector types can be included, such as meteorological, fire, smoke, and biological agents.
The design focus will be on ease of system deployment in any location without introducing interference with the existing system infrastructure.
Detailed validation of the Subway Environmental Simulation Chemical and Biological (SESCB) numerical modeling code: A fully validated code can be used to confidently predict the possibility of identifying and quantifying the threat created from the release of a variety of chemical and biological agents.
Sensor instruments as described above can be used to validate the code predictions in a subway station during simulated chemical and biological releases.
This effort will also employ the SESCB model to access and define consequence assessment and crisis management tools.
Security Survey - Public Perception: Collection and analysis of data on safety and security concerns provides FTA with a basis for identifying key issues.
The security survey will: (1) determine concerns of citizens regarding public transit in and around their neighborhoods and (2) assess and evaluate these concerns in conjunction with and relation to transit designs for livable communities.
This information will be invaluable for more effectively meeting transportation needs of diverse communities throughout the nation.
Safety/No Tolerance Conference: At transit agencies where the "no tolerance" policy has been in effect, the record indicates that crime is considerably lower than on those systems where minor infractions are tolerated.
This conference would explore enforcement of a "no tolerance" policy to discourage minor infractions in public transit which impact the level of criminal activity in transit as well as the public perception of the security of the transit system.
The comfort level of transit riders is increased with the awareness that a "no tolerance" policy for minor infractions is imposed and seriously enforced.

The FTA also funds a number of transit safety and security training programs through the Transportation Safety Institute.
The listing of courses and seminars in transit security and safety can be accessed online at www.tsi.dot.gov, or by contacting Jim Lopez, manager of TSI's Transit Safety and Security Division, at telephone (405) 954-3682.
(Courses are detailed in the training resource section of this guide.)
American Public Transportation Association (APTA) APTA has a number of safety and security resources to assist transit systems' efforts to enhance safety and security.
(See website at http://apta.com/).
Agencies that have not developed system safety program plans or security plans can obtain information on APTA's system safety programs for bus, rail, and commuter rail operations through APTA's Safety and Security Section at telephone (202) 496-4879, or by e-mail to ghull@apta.com.
APTA also has a transit security committee called the Committee on Public Safety that provides a forum for information sharing and interagency support.
Persons interested in participating in the committee can contact APTA's Safety and Security Section at telephone (202) 496-4879.
To be responsive to Congress and the Administration, APTA staff has started preliminary work to identify areas of need for funding support in public transportation safety and security.
Initial discussions to identify capital items, operations items, and research and development needs in transit safety and security are underway.
APTA also produces the Passenger Transport, a weekly newspaper of the public transportation industry.
The paper's resources on terrorism and public transportation include: Passenger Transport, Volume 59, No 37, September 17, 2001.
This edition contains an article on public transit's reactions to terrorist attacks and contains a list of resources regarding the effect of terrorist attacks on public transportation systems.

STATE OF FLORIDA ANTI-TERRORISM INITIATIVES Governor's Office On September 14, Governor Jeb Bush directed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) and the Division of Emergency Management (DEM) to immediately complete a comprehensive assessment of Florida's capability to prevent, mitigate, and respond to a terrorist attack.
Under the state plan, FDLE is the lead agency for crisis management and DEM is the lead agency for consequence management.
The Governor directed these agencies to consult with all involved parties and recommend improvements for strengthening the state's antiterrorism strategy within ten working days.
Governor Bush further directed that the assessment examine the State's capabilities regarding training programs, equipment, and execution protocols, focusing particularly on preventing/mitigating a terrorist attack.
To meet these goals four primary workgroups were formed around the State's existing emergency support functions: Emergency Services, Human Services, Critical Infrastructure, and Public Information 
Using the existing networks of law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical services, and selected private sector partners, these workgroups collected information about Florida's existing capabilities and capacities.
An assessment tool was developed and deployed to collect critical information not already available at the State level.
Outstanding response was received from sheriffs, police, fire/Rescue, emergency medical, and State agencies, as well as critical private sector industries.
Although this was not a scientific survey, the returned instruments provided valuable insight into the status of Florida's anti-terrorism preparedness.
Subject matter experts were asked to join the workgroups to review and analyze the information and develop recommendations for strengthening Florida's safety and security framework.
Recommendations of this group were reviewed, validated and approved by the chief executives of State, County, and Municipal agencies with emergency responsibilities in Florida.
The primary recommendations for strengthening Florida's anti-terrorism preparedness are outlined in the Task Force Report: Assessing Florida's Anti-Terrorism Capabilities, September 2001.
This report can be viewed at http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/publications/anti-terrorism.pdf On October 11, 2001, Governor Jeb Bush signed Executive Order #01-300, (http://www.dca.state.fl.us/fdem/executive_order_01_300.pdf) strengthening the state's capacity to enhance domestic security and to combat terrorist activities.
The order directs state agencies to implement safeguards to enhance protection of all Floridians.
The following actions are to be taken immediately, or upon legislative approval of funding if necessary: Law Enforcement Initiatives (Florida Department of Law Enforcement): Creates seven Regional Domestic Security Task Forces, under the auspices of FDLE, to coordinate responses to terrorist incidents, ensure proper training for state and local personnel, and collect and disseminate terrorist intelligence; Begins the process of training local law enforcement, fire, emergency and other "first responders;" Calls on FDLE to make recommendations on funding, prioritizing and distributing equipment for emergency personnel to safely perform anti-terrorism duties; Creates a statewide anti-terrorism database for use by all Florida law enforcement agencies; and Reiterates the importance of aggressively combating hate crimes against ethnic groups in coordination with Florida's Attorney General and local law enforcement.
Chemical and Biological Attack Initiatives (Department of Health (DOH)): Directs DOH to take steps to ensure quick dissemination of medical information about chemical and biological attacks; Directs stockpiling of necessary pharmaceutical treatments for potential attacks; Creates a fully-staffed statewide epidemic intelligence service; and Directs the implementation of a training program for health officials across the state.
6
Driver's License Initiatives (Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV): Provides for electronic sharing of driver's license information with FDLE and other criminal justice agencies; Allows issuing 30-day temporary permits when time is needed by the DHSMV to verify an applicant's identity; Limits the duration of driver's license to the duration of INS documents; and Directs DHSMV to retain electronic copies of any foreign document used to establish identity.
Specialized Anti-Terrorism Personnel: Allows the Commissioner of FDLE to serve as, or name a, Chief of Florida Domestic Security Initiatives, and directs FDLE to report to the Governor and legislative leadership by November 1, 2001, on additional efforts needed to combat terrorism; and Creates an 11-person Florida Domestic Security Advisory Panel to provide and evaluate recommendations for combating terrorism.
Department of Community Affairs (DCA) Â­ Division of Emergency Management (DEM) See the bureau web site at http://www.floridadisaster.org/.
The Division of Emergency Management, within the Department of Community Affairs, ensures that Florida is ready to handle any emergencies, recover quickly from them, and mitigate against their adverse impact.
The DEM administers the State's Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP), which establishes the framework to ensure that the State of Florida will be adequately prepared to deal with the variety of hazards that threaten our communities, businesses and environment.
The Division contains the following bureaus: Compliance Planning 
Staff also conduct on-site audits of county CEMPs and provide technical assistance for plan development.
The bureau also administers the Emergency Management Preparedness and Assistance Trust Fund, county base grants, and incoming federal, state, or private funding through the Finance and Logistics Management Section.
This section also works directly with the Bureau of Preparedness and Response to assist with the logistics of disaster response and recovery operations and with all branches of state government to ensure resources are managed efficiently.
Policy 
They are also responsible for developing the division's areas of the Agency Strategic Plan, the Five-Year Strategic Plan, and the State Land Plan.
The office develops Executive Orders to engage state resources in disasters, prepares Presidential Disaster Declarations or Emergency Requests, Small Business Administration disaster declaration requests, and others.
This office coordinates administration of the U.S. Department of Justice's mass immigration plan.
Preparedness 
The Bureau has two Sections: Preparedness and Response, and two independent support units: the Technical Support Unit, and the Administrative Support Unit.
Recovery 
Assistance for recovery from disasters is provided through the federal infrastructure assistance, human services assistance, and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
These programs help to rebuild lives and communities that have been impacted by a major disaster, and to reduce the impact of future disasters through mitigation.
The following DEM resources specifically address terrorism.

From Mineta Transportation Institute http://www.transweb.sjsu.edu/transweb.htm Protecting Surface Transportation Systems and Patrons from Terrorist Activities, Brian Michael Jenkins, January 1997 (Out of print) Full text available at: http://www.transweb.sjsu.edu/publications/terrorism/Protect.htm Contemporary terrorists have made public transportation a new theater of operations.
For those determined to kill in quantity and willing to kill indiscriminately, public transportation offers an attractive target.
Because it is public and used by millions of people daily, there is necessarily little security.
Passengers are strangers, promising attackers anonymity.
Concentrations of people in contained environments are especially vulnerable to conventional explosives and unconventional weapons and attacks on public transportation, the circulatory systems of urban environments, cause great disruption and alarm, which are the traditional goals of terrorism.
In order to effectively meet the threat posed by terrorism and other forms of violent crime, it is essential that transportation system operators have a thorough understanding of the security measures employed elsewhere, especially by those transportation entities that have suffered terrorist attacks or that confront high threat levels.

This volume reports on the first phase of a continuing research effort carried out by the Norman Y.
Mineta International Institute for Surface Transportation Policy Studies (IISTPS) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
It comprises a chronology of attacks on surface transportation systems; four case studies of transportation security measures (in Paris, Atlanta, and New York, and at Amtrak); security surveys of nine additional cities in the United States; and an annotated bibliography of current literature on the topic.
Protecting Surface Transportation Systems Against Terrorism and Serious Crime.
Brian Michael Jenkins, October 2001 (Available October, 2001) Contemporary terrorists have made public transportation a new theater of operations.
In order to effectively meet the threat posed by terrorism and other forms of violent crime, it is essential that transportation system operators have a thorough understanding of the security measures employed by other operators, and especially by those entities that suffered terrorist attacks or confront a high level of threat.
In a previous Institute project, four case studies were completed (New York, Atlanta, Paris, and Amtrak).
The results from this research were combined with the results of a Federal Transportation Agency survey of nine public transportation systems in the United States.
The results of the previous study were published by IISTPS as Protecting Surface Transportation Systems and Patrons from Terrorist Activities, (IISTPS Report 97-4).

Published March 1996 The topic for this symposium was selected to help satisfy the increased need for awareness of and preparedness for possible terrorism attacks on the surface transportation systems within the United States and the world.
A group of experts was assembled to present a summary of their vast experience and concerns in the areas of terrorism to an invited group of delegates drawn from transportation agencies, law enforcement, other government agencies and the private sector.
Interactive discussions and panels were also held.
The speakers included representatives from the New York Transit Authority, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Amtrak, and American Medical Response West.
Topics included lessons learned from the Oklahoma City Bombing, the World Trade Center Bombing, the Unabomber, and the Arizona Derailment.
Emergency medical responses were also discussed.

Transit Cooperative Research Program Reports Improving Transit Security.
Jerome A. Needle and Renee M. Cobb, J.D, 1997.
Many transit agencies are experiencing an upsurge in both the incidence and intensity of violence in and around its vehicles and stations.
The costs -financial and social --associated with those violent incidents is tremendous.
They involve escalating worker's compensation payments and medical expenses; higher levels of assault pay; increased absenteeism and worker anxiety; deterioration of equipment and increased frequency of required repair; decreased ridership, and greater passenger fear for personal safety.
A number of issues should be addressed when developing a program to combat an increase in violence, including coordination of efforts with local law enforcement, schools, and community groups.
There is also a need for considering engineering and design changes to provide greater structural safety to vehicle operators, station agents, and patrons.
This synthesis describes good practices in conflict avoidance.

Emergency Preparedness for Transit Terrorism.
Annabelle Boyd and John P. Sullivan, 1997.
The threat of terrorism in various forms has been directed in increasing frequency toward bus and rail public transit organizations.
Some transit agencies have extensive emergency procedures available for handling fires, accidents, power outages, and so forth; however, there are aspects of potential terrorist acts with which transit systems, and the municipalities and communities in which transit agencies operate, may be ill prepared to deal.
Of particular concern is the ability, or lack thereof, of municipalities, transit agencies or other governmental agencies engaged in emergency response or crisis management to detect, classify, and properly react to a range of threats, including chemical, biological, and explosive devices.
Key issues such as the following are covered: Internal organization emergency responsibilities; detection, classification, and response procedures; crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED); coordination with first responders to include memoranda of understanding; training for employees and other emergency and responding agencies; interagency training and drills; coordination with other responders, such as state and federal agencies; command and control systems, including communications; and identification of funding sources for technology, training, and research.

Other Resource Documents Public Transit Reacts to Horrific Terrorist Attacks.
With the deadly terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, the nation's public transportation community has had much the same reaction as the general population: shock, anger, sadness, and an overwhelming, immediate desire to help.
This article from Passenger Transport, that can also be found in full-text on the APTA website, discusses the reaction of public transit in regard to several different transportation agencies in New York, Washington, nationally, and internationally.

Transit police may find themselves on the front lines of America's strategic challenge for the 21st century, homeland defense.
It is through the underground transport system that a terrorist or rogue nation may find the easiest means to attack the cities of the United States.
Field experiments conducted by the US Army in the 1960s using the harmless bacillus globigii stimulant showed that much of New York City could have been infected by an attack on the subway system, with the agent being disseminated through ventilation shafts and station openings.
This article discusses this case and its findings on prevention.

Chemical Terrorism Response in Public Facilities.
Susanna P. Gordon, 2000.
The trends of terrorism towards large-scale, high-visibility, high-casualty assaults and towards attacks on public transportation facilities support the rising concern about chemical attacks on public facilities.
The incidence of the Tokyo subway being attacked by Aum Shinrikyo in 1995 that resulted in the death of 12 people, caused 5500 casualties, and impacted 15 subway stations is discussed in this article.
This article also informs how a wellprepared facility emergency response system can significantly reduce the impacts of a chemical attack and may discourage such attacks from taking place.

Cops, Cameras, and Enclosures: A Synthesis of the Effectiveness of Methods to Provide Enhanced Security for Bus Operators.
National Center for Transit Research, Center for Urban Transportation Research, 2001.
The safety of operators and passengers is a primary concern of transit systems and has become an increasingly important issue to transit bus operators themselves.
A number of transit agencies use different techniques to minimize the possibilities of assaults against bus operators and passengers such as uniformed or plainclothes police officers or security guards, digital cameras, and/or bus operator enclosures.
This research surveyed transit agencies that have used these techniques to determine their level of success, cost effectiveness, and acceptance by both bus operators and passengers.
The study also identifies other techniques used to ensure the safety of bus operators such as passenger relations training to avoid conflict.
The effect of "full wrap advertising" on passenger safety is also explored.
The findings are presented in synthesis form.
Web site: http://www.nctr.usf.edu Improving Surface Transportation Security: A Research and Development Strategy.
Transportation Research Board and National Research Council, 1999.
The surface transportation system is vital to our nation's economy, defense, and quality of life.
Because threats against the system have hitherto been perceived as minor, little attention has been paid to its security.
But the world is changing, as highlighted by dramatic incidents such as the terrorist chemical attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.
Research and development can contribute to that response in important ways.
The first step is to develop a better understanding of the problem.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has already begun this effort by assessing the surface transportation system's vulnerability to hostile attacks.
Further work is needed in some areas, particularly regarding chemical, biological, and cyber attacks, and especially the strategic vulnerability of the surface transportation system as a whole that may result from internal and external interdependencies.
USDOT's first priority in setting up a should be to define and put in place systematic process of five steps: clear possible solutions, rigorous evaluation research and development program for the security of surface transportation a clear and comprehensive strategy.
That strategy should be founded on a definition of the problem and objectives, identification of a wide variety of of those alternatives, careful decision making, and effective implementation.
First, a dual-use approach, in which security objectives are furthered at the same time as other transportation goals, can encourage the implementation of security technologies and processes.
Second, modeling could be used to develop a better understanding of the scope of the security problem.
Third, USDOT can play an important role in 14
developing and disseminating information about best practices that use existing technologies and processes, including low-technology alternatives.
Finally, security should be considered as part of a broader picture, not a wholly new and different problem but one that is similar and closely connected to the transportation community's previous experience in responding to accidents, natural disasters, and hazardous materials.

Violent crimes against public transit bus operators and passengers in Michigan were studied.
The study was funded by the Michigan Department of Transportation and conducted by the University of Michigan in early 1999.
A survey approach examined transit passenger perceptions of numerous transit-related crime reduction measures, primarily patrol and security, design actions, and technological innovation.
The respondents ranked emergency telephones for passengers and increased lighting as the best crime prevention measures.
The survey was part of a wider study that also surveyed transit agencies and transit vehicle operators.
