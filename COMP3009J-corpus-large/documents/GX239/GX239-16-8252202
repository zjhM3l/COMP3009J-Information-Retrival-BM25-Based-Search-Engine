1 REP. SHERLOCK: Good evening, welcome to
2 the fifth session of the Rhode Island Special
3 House Commission to Study Gaming.
4 Before we get underway tonight, I would like
5 to remind everyone that we'll be meeting again for
6 the next three weeks.
And next week we're going
7 to have Kathy Scanlon, who is the Executive
8 Director of the Massachusetts Council on Problem
9 Gaming -- Gambling.
Week after that we're going
10 to have Diane Hurley from Jai Alai, and we're also
11 going to have Dr. Henry Lesieur, who is a
12 colleague of tonight's professional presenter,
13 Dr. Green -- Breen, pardon me.
14 And on October 22, we're going to have Thomas
15 Dickerson, who's a specialist on tax issues who
16 has been recommended to us or signed up through
17 the interests of Jai Alai.
And we'll also have on
18 that evening Mark Tucker from CODAC.
19 So, actually, we're already all scheduled all
20 the way through December 3.
So we have an
21 ambitious schedule and we'll just keep rolling
22 along.
23 Tonight we have with us Representative Carol
24 Mumford from Scituate, who's a member of the
<
4
1 commission.
And we have two members of the
2 commission who were present a few minutes ago but
3 they've been called away for awhile, but they
4 will, Chairman Fox and Representative Costantino,
5 will be joining us in a short while, but we
6 decided to get underway.
7 It's my privilege to introduce Dr. Breen,
8 Dr. Bob Breen, who is a professional in problem
9 gambling.
He's a clinical psychologist and
10 specializes in problem gambling at Rhode Island
11 Hospital, and he's well known.
12 A few weeks ago there was an important piece
13 in the Sunday Journal on gambling where, in large
14 part, much of the work of Dr. Breen was featured.
15 We're privileged to have you here tonight, Dr.
16 Breen.
17 DR. BREEN: Thank you.
18 BOB BREEN, Ph.D
19 (HAVING BEEN DULY SWORN)
20 DR. BREEN: Thank you for inviting me to
21 speak.
My name is Bob Breen.
I'm a clinical
22 psychologist and I specialize in the treatment of
23 problem gamblers.
And I've been solely focused on
24 that area for the last ten years.
<
5
1 (PAUSE - TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES)
2 DR. BREEN: My name is Bob Breen.
I am a
3 clinical psychologist and I specialize in the
4 treatment of problem gamblers.
I'm currently the
5 Clinical Director of the Rhode Island Gambling
6 Treatment Program which is located at Rhode Island
7 Hospital's Department of Outpatient Psychiatry.
8 And that program receives annual funds from the
9 Department of Health in order to provide treatment
10 for problem gamblers and their families.
11 We provide treatment to those who need it,
12 whether or not they have insurance.
In the first
13 14 months of our program, we haven't turned away
14 anybody for any reason.
As you can see from the
15 slide, some of the services that we offer are
16 psychiatric evaluation; individual family therapy
17 for compulsive gamblers and their family members;
18 educational support group; and outreach, which
19 means we go around and we speak to -- we've done
20 talks at middle school, at EAPs, mental health
21 agencies, and so forth.
22 I plan to divide my time this evening into --
23 between three general topics.
First, I'm going to
24 present you with some significant information
<
6
1 about problem gamblers in Rhode Island right now,
2 today.
Who are they? Where do they gamble? What
3 do they gamble on? And how much damage do they
4 cause themselves and their families? Once I've
5 given you the picture of how severe this problem
6 is, I'll present you with some data from our
7 program that indicates that the treatment we
8 provide is effective.
9 Second, I'm going to present you with some
10 original research that we've done at Rhode Island
11 Hospital that addresses the addictive qualities of
12 VLTs.
Third, I'm going to take the opportunity to
13 give you my own recommendations for public policy,
14 vis-a-vis the expansion of gambling in Rhode
15 Island.
16 I've been following these hearings and I know
17 that you've heard from various expert witnesses
18 about the signs and symptoms of problem gamblingl,
19 how it's assessed; the psychiatric, financial, and
20 social costs of problem gambling; how prevalent it
21 is.
I'm not going to go back over that territory;
22 it's already in your record.
However, before I
23 begin, I want to clarify some of the terms that
24 I'm going to use.
<
7
1 I've used the term "problem gambler" thus
2 far.
And while I'm speaking, I may use the words
3 "pathological gambler" or "compulsive gambler,"
4 interchangeably.
I don't want to get distracted
5 by labels.
Rest assured whenever I say -- whether
6 I say "problem," "compulsive," or "pathological,"
7 I'm talking about somebody who has a severe
8 chronic psychiatric disorder as diagnosed by
9 DSM IV.
10 While I'm defining some of my terms, let me
11 make the following disclaimer.
There are two
12 euphemisms that I don't adhere to.
One is the
13 term "gaming."
I say "gambling," because I like
14 to call things what they are.
Gaming is Scrabble
15 or sport fishing.
Gambling is playing a VLT or
16 buying a scratch ticket.
17 The second euphemism has to do with the use
18 of the word "casino."
If you look in Webster's
19 Dictionary, you'll see that "casino" is any
20 establishment whose primary business is gambling.
21 We have two casinos in Rhode Island already:
22 One's at Lincoln and the other's at Newport.
23 Table games don't make a casino.
Nonstop gambling
24 makes a casino.
<
8
1 In addition, you'll hear me refer to problem
2 gamblers as being addicted to gambling.
That's my
3 clinical approach and my theoretical model.
By
4 the way, I rarely encounter a patient who doesn't
5 immediately recognize and identify with that.
6 That having been said, let me give you some
7 data now from people who've presented for
8 treatment at our program at Rhode Island Hospital.
9 These are the clinical and demographic
10 characteristics of problem gamblers in Rhode
11 Island today.
12 Let me acknowledge the limitations of this
13 type of data.
It's been collected from a
14 treatment seeking sample.
The limitation, the
15 major limitation, of that is that we can't
16 automatically generalize these data to the
17 population at large; but, to my knowledge, this is
18 the only data that exists for problem gamblers in
19 Rhode Island.
And the sample size is large enough
20 to be taken seriously.
We have 204 people who've
21 presented over the last 14 months in our program.
22 REP. SHERLOCK: Do you have a time frame
23 for these data?
24 DR. BREEN: The last 14 months.
<
9
1 REP. SHERLOCK: 14 months?
2 DR. BREEN: Yeah.
3 REP. SHERLOCK: Okay.
Thank you.
4 DR. BREEN: In addition, talking about
5 methodology, our methods of collecting this data
6 and establishing the validity and reliability of
7 it are extremely rigorous, and I'll tell you more
8 about that later in the presentation.
9 As you can see, almost half of the gamblers
10 that we've admitted are women; 92 percent are
11 Caucasian; 8 percent minorities; and the average
12 income was about $42,000.
Most of the patients
13 are 35 to 54 years old.
And fully 21 percent are
14 55 or over, with 3 percent in the age category of
15 65 and over.
This looks at age and gender broken
16 down in the sample.
17 And you'll see that in all the gamblers that
18 are 35 or over, all three of those catagories, the
19 number of women and men is -- well, it happens to
20 be exactly equal.
There are 76 total over the age
21 of 35: 76 men, 76 women.
Under 35 years of age,
22 men outnumber women by an almost three to one
23 margin.
24 Most of the patients that we see get a
<
10
1 psychiatric diagnostic interview.
98 patients or
2 78 percent of those who receive that interview had
3 a depressive disorder.
25 of those patients or 18
4 percent had a current substance use disorder.
5 Now, with these data I don't distinguish between
6 alcohol dependence and any other substance
7 dependence; I lump them altogether.
8 Interestingly, 24 or 17 percent had a past
9 substance use disorder that was more or less
10 resolved.
52 patients had a current anxiety
11 disorder; the most frequent being panic disorder,
12 post-traumatic stress, and social phobia.
Not
13 shown on this slide are four patients who had --
14 or five patients, which is 4 percent of the
15 sample, had bipolar disorder, which is a severe
16 chronic psychiatric problem.
17 Next question I want to address is what do
18 these problem gamblers lose their money on.
But
19 before I do that, I want to address a common
20 misperception about problem gambling.
I take the
21 time to spotlight this information because some of
22 those in the field of pathological gambling
23 research still believe the old wives' tale of the
24 compulsive gambler who will bet on anything, two
<
11
1 cockroaches up a wall.
I'm not saying there
2 aren't individuals like that, but it's rare.
3 I've researched this question across many
4 years and different geographical areas in the
5 United States, and it just isn't true.
The vast
6 majority of problem gamblers focus on one and only
7 one type of gambling at any point in time.
Thus,
8 a VLT addict, for example, will not spent any
9 significant time playing the dogs; and a blackjack
10 player could care less about playing a slot
11 machine.
12 If there's an exception to this rule, it may
13 be instant lottery games; and by that I mean
14 scratch tickets and Keno, which may be rapidly
15 becoming a secondary problem for a lot of these
16 people.
And that's probably due to the
17 convenience factor and because it's a continuous
18 form of gambling.
I'll say more about continuous
19 forms of gambling in a little bit.
20 So with that in mind, what's the main problem
21 as far as what type of gambling people are hooked
22 on in Rhode Island? As you can see, 69 percent of
23 our patients are addicted to VLTs or video slots.
24 This includes both slots in Connecticut and Rhode
<
12
1 Island casinos.
2 I just want to point out and explain what
3 entered into the lottery category on this slide.
4 It consists of those whose major problem involved
5 either instant lottery games, scratch tickets or
6 Keno; and a significant number of those folks got
7 into trouble because they're bartenders,
8 waitresses, clerks in convenience stores that
9 gamble while they work.
10 Where did they lose their money? Upon
11 admission to our program, patients respond to the
12 following: Of the money you've lost in the last
13 12 months gambling, what proportion was lost at
14 each of these places? Now, the percents here are
15 average and they don't add up to a hundred across
16 the catagories, because not a lot of people gamble
17 in all places.
18 But the statistics breakdown as follows: The
19 Lincoln Park category here consists of 92 patients
20 who gambled at Lincoln Park in the previous year,
21 and they lost an average of 67 percent of their
22 gambling losses at that venue.
Newport Grand Jai
23 Alai: 26 patients are represented there, and they
24 lost 28 percent of their gambling losses.
<
13
1 Foxwoods represents 64 patients who gambled there
2 in the previous year.
Mohegan Sun, 28 patients.
3 And the Rhode Island Lottery represents 46
4 patients who lost 27 percent of their losings
5 playing lottery games.
6 What's the financial impact of problem
7 gambling? The quick answer is it's enormous, but
8 I'm going to go into more detail, and I break it
9 down into two main components.
The first
10 component is current outstanding debts that are
11 directly due to gambling.
For example: Credit
12 card debt that's been used for cash advances for
13 gambling; personal loans to pay gambling debts;
14 equity loans to gamble or pay gambling debts.
15 Now, the second part of it has to do with
16 assets that have been liquidated.
It's not
17 exactly debt.
I don't -- I may not owe $10,000
18 but I had a $10,000 T Bill and I don't have it
19 anymore because I sold it.
So that includes
20 stocks and bonds, investment, retirement savings,
21 jewelry, even homes.
I've had a couple of
22 patients who've had to sell their house and use
23 the proceeds to pay gambling debts.
24 I want to point out also that the outstanding
<
14
1 debts may not include bills that are overdue
2 because there's not money to pay them because the
3 money has been gambled away.
For example, the
4 electric bill is overdue but you can't pay it
5 because the checking account is overdrawn because
6 you used the money gambling.
We also really can't
7 pick up very well on out-of-cash loss,
8 out-of-pocket cash losses.
9 For example, you pick up your paycheck, you
10 cash it on the way home, stop at a casino, lose it
11 all; it never gets to the bank account, and that's
12 hard to keep track of.
I point those things out
13 because what that says to me is that, if anything,
14 these estimates I'm going to show you are
15 conservative.
16 Another misconception has been that reports
17 of financial losses from problem gamblers are not
18 reliable.
I disagreed with that.
And I developed
19 a method of recording this type of information
20 that involves two stages.
A paper and pencil
21 self-report, and then that's confirmed with an
22 interview.
23 Two years ago I established the reliability
24 and the validity of this method by using a blind
<
15
1 independent interviewer who followed up with
2 people at 6 to 12 months and asked them about how
3 much money they'd lost gambling; and it proved to
4 be extremely reliable.
What that means is people
5 know what they've lost and they'll report the same
6 thing 12 months from now that they report today.
7 The average current debt directly due to
8 gambling in our treatment sample was $33,000;
9 that's an average.
The primary contributor to
10 that category is credit card debt.
The average
11 asset sold to finance gambling was $34,000 and the
12 primary contributor to that category was IRA
13 savings.
14 I want to point out that the numbers in the
15 first two columns don't add up to the number in
16 the third column that has total financial damage,
17 and that's because not everybody reported that
18 they had sold assets.
19 The outstanding debt column and the total
20 columns are for 180 people while only 136 had sold
21 assets or liquidated savings.
I hadn't mentioned
22 bankruptcy yet, but that's on this graph as well.
23 And it's -- we kept it separate and apart, just an
24 arbitrary decision.
This represents 41 patients
<
16
1 who had declared bankruptcy in the past due to
2 gambling, and the average amount that they'd
3 written off through bankruptcy was $48,000 due to
4 gambling.
That's not included in the total
5 financial damage current.
6 I want to talk a little bit about the
7 severity of the gambling problem as it's ongoing
8 and what it looks like when people present for
9 treatment.
Patients gambled an average of 12 days
10 in the previous 30 days at the time of admission
11 to our program.
They'd lost an average of almost
12 $3,000 in that same one-month period.
13 The South Oaks Gambling Screen is the most
14 widely used screen for pathological gambling.
15 It's valid and reliable and it's been used in the
16 majority of research in this area.
17 It was created by my colleague Dr. Henry
18 Lesieur at the Rhode Island Hospital program and
19 it's already been described by several of your
20 expert witnesses.
But to remind you, I want to
21 just remind you that the range of scores on this
22 instrument is 0 to 20 and 5 indicates a probable
23 pathological gambler.
24 You can see, our sample is relatively severe
<
17
1 on the SOGS score with an average of 13.
The GSI,
2 which stands for gambling severity index, is an
3 arithmetically devised index of the severity of
4 gambling problems.
This was also devised by Henry
5 as an addition to the addiction severity index,
6 which is used by most states, state funded
7 substance abuse programs.
So he created a
8 gambling module for this assessment instrument.
9 The GSI score is a decimal between zero and one
10 with "one" being maximum severity and "zero" being
11 no severity at all.
12 Our patients scored an average of .69 on this
13 admission to the program.
An important question
14 is: Is treatment effective for people with
15 gambling problems? Is state funding worthwhile?
16 At the Rhode Island Gambling Treatment Program we
17 follow up all treatment seekers at six-month
18 intervals, at every six months, and we bother them
19 as long as they'll let us call them up and bother
20 them.
The follow-ups are blind and they're
21 conducted by a trained independent interviewer.
22 Even treatment dropouts and refuser are followed
23 up.
24 An example of a treatment dropout is someone
<
18
1 who comes to therapy for a little while and stops
2 coming and just sort of drifts off.
A treatment
3 refuser is the person who comes for an initial
4 evaluation and makes an appointment for therapy
5 but never keeps the first appointment.
6 The reason that we follow up on everybody is
7 twofold: Eventually, we'll get enough treatment
8 refusers and dropouts so we'll be able to compare
9 to the people who get treatment do significantly
10 better than those who drop out.
And another thing
11 that we're interested in is the natural course of
12 pathological gambling, natural recovery.
I'd like
13 to show you that follow-up data now.
14 The next few slides refer to the previous
15 30 days at the top of the follow-up interview.
16 The average number of days that patients gambled
17 uncontrollably, they gambled more than they could
18 afford to lose, declined from about ten days to
19 two-and-a-half days in the previous 30.
This is,
20 again, at 6 and 12 months.
21 I forgot to tell you that the sample that we
22 have followed up on so far is up to 66 patients
23 with at least a six-month follow-up and 11 who
24 have a 6 and a 12-month follow-up, and I've
<
19
1 combined those.
What I'm talking about here is
2 the last follow up, the last recorded follow-up.
3 The money that they lost in the previous 30
4 days declined from 2800 plus to $645.
The average
5 gambling severity index declined from .71 to .36;
6 and remember, again, that's an index from zero to
7 one.
So we cut it in half.
And the SOGS score --
8 now that refers to the previous six months, and
9 the reason for that is that it's more of a tool
10 that's based on DSM criteria and you wouldn't
11 expect it to change that quickly, so we use a
12 six-month time frame on that.
And the previous
13 six months, that declined from almost 14 to a
14 little over 7.
15 As you may have surmised, we take a harm
16 reduction approach to the treatment of problem
17 gambling.
Of course, abstinence from all forms of
18 gambling would be the safest and a most
19 conservative goal.
But we view gambling as a
20 chronic disorder, possibly a lifetime disorder;
21 and we view success in terms of improvement rather
22 than cure.
23 With that in mind, I distinguish between
24 abstinence from all forms of gambling at this
<
20
1 follow-up time and abstinence from the main
2 problem form.
Remembering what I said before,
3 that most of these people focus on one and only
4 one thing.
5 In 76 patients from 6 to 12 months after
6 assessment, 35 percent didn't gamble on anything
7 at all in the previous 30 days.
That's extremely
8 important to note that 55 percent didn't bet on
9 their primary problem form of gambling.
In other
10 words, while patients may be continuing to buy
11 Powerball tickets or play Bingo or whatever,
12 they're abstaining from the thing that caused the
13 most damage.
VLT addicts are not playing the
14 VLTs.
Sports bettors are not betting on sports.
15 (PAUSE)
16 DR. BREEN: Excuse me.
The next issue I
17 want to address is the question of the addictive
18 qualities of computerized gambling devices.
19 There's currently a class-action lawsuit that's
20 been adjudicated in Quebec.
It's similar to the
21 tobacco suits that we've seen in the states in
22 that the plaintiffs are arguing that the lottery
23 authority promoted, marketed an addictive product
24 without taking rudimentary precautions or warning
<
21
1 the public.
2 Computer technology has changed the face of
3 gambling forever and in a way that we don't even
4 realize yet.
21st Century gambling is powered by
5 computer chips and random number generators.
6 VLTs, video poker, and slots have been called the
7 crack cocaine of gambling.
8 While that analogy makes for a very
9 provocative sound by -- and I started hearing it
10 about ten years, I wondered if there was any
11 validity to it.
So I decided to conduct the first
12 study to determine whether video slots does indeed
13 cause a more rapid progression of gambling
14 problems.
This data comes from Rhode Island
15 people as well.
16 I collected detailed histories of gambling
17 through self-reports and diagnostic interviews,
18 like I described to you.
And as I mentioned
19 previously, this method has shown excellent
20 reliability.
The subjects were 174 problem
21 gamblers in Rhode Island.
62 of those reported
22 that they had become problem gamblers through
23 their involvement in what I call the traditional
24 forms of gambling, which include cards, dice,
<
22
1 other casino games, horses and dogs, sports
2 betting.
3 112 of them reported that they developed
4 their problems after they became involved with
5 computerized gambling, VLTs.
So the research
6 question, then, to summarize, is how long does it
7 take to become a compulsive gambler and do VLTs
8 cause this to happen more rapidly.
Okay.
9 Results indicated that gambling problems
10 develop significantly faster with VLTs.
It took
11 an average of 15 months to become a pathological
12 gambler using these machines.
That's 15 months
13 between the time when they became regularly
14 involved on a once-a-month or better schedule.
15 The average for all the other types lumped
16 together was over four years.
17 The amount of money that the two groups
18 reported they had lost, the amount of financial
19 damage, is about the same.
There's no significant
20 difference there, which means that the VLT addicts
21 lost about the same amount of money in one quarter
22 of the time.
23 This gives you a more detailed breakdown of
24 the progression of problems in gamblers.
There
<
23
1 are ten people in the instant lottery category.
2 And they took an average of 1.9 years to develop
3 their problems.
There are 20 in tables.
And what
4 I mean by "tables" is table games, cards, dice.
I
5 don't know if there's any roulette players in
6 there.
There might be one or two.
Horses or
7 dogs, five years, better than five years.
And
8 sports bettors, six years.
There are 17 in the
9 horse and dog category, 17 people; and 12 in the
10 sports betting category.
11 So the evidence does suggest that addiction
12 does progress much more rapidly in VLTs.
Are they
13 addiction delivery devices? Everything about them
14 is designed to promote continued responding and
15 loss of control.
The displays, the sound effects,
16 the speed that you can bet maximum dollars.
Did
17 you know that you could bet 450 on a nickle
18 machine with the push of a button? That's a lot
19 of nickles.
20 The next issue I want to address is what
21 proportion of gambling revenues come from problem
22 gamblers.
I'm going to refer you to two large
23 well done studies on this issue.
The first one is
24 from 1998 from the Nova Scotia Department of
<
24
1 Health.
They did a survey with VLT players and
2 they screened over 18,000 people.
They estimated
3 that 16 percent of regular VLT gamblers were
4 problem gamblers, and they accounted for 53
5 percent of VLT profits in Nova Scotia.
6 The study also suggested some interesting
7 ways that problem gamblers can be identified early
8 on-site.
Problem gamblers played an average of
9 189 minutes -- that's over three hours -- every
10 time.
Non-problem players play half-an-hour to an
11 hour.
12 Problem gamblers, because they spend so much
13 time in that environment, make up 48 to 58 percent
14 of the people playing the machines at any one
15 time, depending on the time of the day, the day of
16 the week, and so forth.
17 Second study that looked at this is from 1999
18 and it's from Australia.
It's a National
19 Productivity Commission report that used a really
20 excellent random stratified sampling method and
21 interviewed over 10,000 VLT players.
42 percent
22 of the revenues from VLTs were attributed to
23 problem gamblers.
The average problem gambler
24 lost 17 times what the non-problem VLT player
<
25
1 lost.
2 Given these data, is there an approach that
3 would protect the public without hurting the
4 gambling industry? There is, in fact, responsible
5 gambling software that exists right now that's on
6 the market and has been for some time.
It can be
7 easily loaded onto existing VLTs.
What does this
8 software do? Some of the features are that every
9 individual player can set his or her own limits
10 for how much he or she wants to lose.
11 You can set your own limits for how much time
12 you want to play on that machine or how many
13 credits you want to reach on that machine.
And
14 when you reach one of those limits, the machine
15 will give you a message, it will interrupt you,
16 and it will say "You've exceeded your time limit"
17 or "You've lost more than the $50 that you said
18 you wanted to lose."
You can also set it to give
19 you random timeouts; so the machine will stop
20 working every 15 minutes and you'll have to take a
21 break.
22 Other features involve little quizzes and
23 surveys.
One survey is whether or not you may
24 have a gambling problem that you can optionally do
<
26
1 right on the machine.
Information is disseminated
2 how and where to get help for a gambling problem.
3 And there are little quizzes about probability,
4 the odds of games, gambling fallacies, those sorts
5 of things.
6 So these are things to break up the gambling
7 frenzy, if you will, and so that people can be
8 brought back to reality once in awhile.
At least
9 one company that I know of creates these kinds of
10 products and that's called Game Planit Interactive
11 Corporation.
I think they're in Toronto.
12 And the most immediate question that occurs
13 to me, is why are on earth would safety features
14 not be used.
These are optional.
The player can
15 choose to use them or not.
But to my knowledge,
16 they're not used in any casino anywhere in the
17 United States.
Here's one place to get more
18 information about public health software for VLTs.
19 Just in case you're wondering, I have no
20 financial interest in this company.
I don't stand
21 to profit in any way by making this
22 recommendation.
I strongly suggest that you
23 invite Dr. Horbay to testify to this panel.
24 Now, with your permission I'll take a few
<
27
1 minutes to summarize what I've said so far and to
2 make some specific recommendations.
I've pointed
3 out the relationship between problem gamblers, the
4 gambling industry, which includes the Rhode Island
5 Lottery Commission, and the enormous stream of
6 revenues that flow into private and state coffers.
7 State sponsored or licensed gambling is here to
8 stay, and I'm not naive enought to think it's
9 going to go away.
10 Essential question of this committee, I
11 think, is whether to allow the expansion of VLTs
12 at the existing casinos in Lincoln and Newport.
13 Maybe you don't have anything to say about that
14 but maybe we can provide some illumination on
15 whether that's a good idea, and also would a Las
16 Vegas style casino be acceptable in Rhode Island.
17 The other question that I think you're going
18 to make some recommendations on is what public
19 health provisions should be implemented to
20 prevent, if possible, and to treat, if necessary,
21 the problems caused by state sponsored and
22 legalized gambling.
23 Just last week in his testimony, Mr. Whyte of
24 the National Council On Problem Gambling promoted
<
28
1 the acronym, PETER, P-E-T-E-R: Prevention,
2 education, treatment, enforcement, and research.
3 Let me look at each of those components.
There is
4 no substantive education or prevention initiative
5 in Rhode Island.
6 There's a public awareness program that's
7 been sponsored through the good graces of the
8 Rhode Island Lottery Commission.
What that
9 amounts to is a public information program to let
10 people know where and how they can access
11 treatment for a problem.
12 Enforcement is poor when it comes to
13 protecting problem gamblers from their own
14 behavior and actions and by extension protecting
15 their spouses, their children, and their
16 employers.
Research is practically nill.
All the
17 data that I've shown you is from unfunded
18 research.
I do it because it needs to be done,
19 not because I get paid for it.
20 What about the treatment initiative? The
21 gambling industry in Rhode Island has had a
22 ten-year free reign.
They've had a ten-year head
23 start.
Only last year were public funds made
24 available for treatment.
Any way I look at it, we
<
29
1 in the public health arena are nine years behind
2 the curve.
We can't catch up if we stick with the
3 current policy.
4 While the protective revenues for the
5 industry in the state continue to increase year to
6 year to year, public funding for treatment was
7 frozen at $150,000 this year, same as it was the
8 first year.
And I don't know what's going on.
9 When revenues from gambling expend, why on earth
10 would public health funding for the problems that
11 it causes not expand on a par.
Makes no sense.
12 To punctuation that point, I'm showing you a
13 graph that has the estimated contribution to the
14 general fund in the year 2002 just from the VLTs,
15 and I got this from the Lottery last week.
It
16 doesn't include lottery games, which is probably
17 another 75 million, but we'll be conservative.
18 150 million into the general fund.
Losses of 180
19 Rhode Island residents that I've assessed, $10.6
20 million.
Total state funds for treatment, it's a
21 little pimple there; you can't really see it.
22 It's $150,000.
So I hope that puts it into
23 graphic perspective for you.
24 While increased treatment dollars are
<
30
1 necessary, pumping money into treatment isn't the
2 whole answer.
The areas of education, prevention
3 enforcement, and research aren't in place right
4 now.
In my opinion, the most important of these
5 is regulation and enforcement of the gambling
6 industry in Rhode Island.
If, as I have
7 testified, 40 to 50 percent of the revenues or the
8 profits from VLTs come from problem gamblers, it's
9 simply foolish to rely on the industry to regulate
10 or to police itself.
Doesn't make sense.
Why
11 would they do it?
12 Gambling isn't a right.
It should be a
13 privilege.
For example, minors can't gamble; they
14 don't have that right.
And the industry and
15 government regulators have a well-established
16 policy of excluding or limiting the participation
17 of certain individuals.
Felons, cheats,
18 trouble-makers can be barred from any gambling
19 establishment.
20 If a customer kicks and breaks a VLT machine
21 at Lincoln Park or Newport Jai Alai, you watch how
22 fast they bar him and you watch how well they keep
23 him out, until he pays for the damage, in which
24 case he might be welcomed back.
<
31
1 In addition, as you heard, I believe, two
2 weeks ago from one of your witnesses, players can
3 be barred for being skillful gamblers.
If you
4 have a chance to win, you don't have a right to
5 gamble here.
Now, if the industry or government
6 can prevent people from placing a bet or even from
7 entering the establishment for profit motives or
8 for integrity motives, in the case of undesirable
9 persons or persons with a criminal background, why
10 not do it for ethical motives? Why not do it for
11 public health motives? If the problem gamblers
12 take their dollars to Connecticut casinos,
13 Connecticut, so be it.
I personally thing that
14 many of them will not.
15 I want to make the following specific
16 recommendations to the commission: There should
17 be a moritorium on the expansion of existing
18 facilities, no new VLTs and no new gambling
19 operations unless and until we get an independent
20 regulatory office.
We need it funded, appointed,
21 and impowered.
This should be a professional
22 full-time staffed agency with carte blanche to
23 inspect all procedures, complaints, and so forth.
24 It must have unilateral authority to levy
<
32
1 significant fines or suspensions of gaming
2 licenses.
This regulatory agency will do most of
3 its work on-site.
That's where you have to go to
4 enforce this stuff.
You can't do it from here.
5 That is, space should be developed at Lincoln and
6 Newport.
This is similar to what they have in New
7 Jersey with the Casino Control Commission, where
8 they have an independent staff stationed on every
9 single casino property.
10 This may surprise you.
I'm advocating player
11 tracking technology.
This should be enabled and
12 instituted as soon as possible.
In order to
13 gamble at one of the facilities, players should be
14 registered at that facility and they should be
15 able to have to swipe their card to gain entry.
16 It would be very simple to do.
There's a
17 multi-national precedent for this in the U.K.
You
18 can't just walk into a casino; you have to be a
19 member.
20 This will make it possible as well -- casinos
21 can use this to run promotions, and they do in
22 Connecticut and most places, but this will make it
23 possible as well for the regulatory body to do its
24 work.
You can track any player's losses, the
<
33
1 amount of time they gamble, and so forth.
2 Part of the regulatory staff's function would
3 be to flag certain player profiles.
Part of
4 the -- for example, players who gamble an average
5 of three hours or more per occasion might be in
6 need of help.
7 I also advocate a professional mental health
8 liaison to be available on the premises, and I
9 would make this a member of the regulatory staff.
10 I'd like the industry to become at least as
11 pro-active with the customer who comes in several
12 times a week, always gambles alone, gambles for
13 several hours at a pop, makes multiple trips to
14 the cash machine as they are with a disruptive
15 patron.
16 The next point I've already discussed with
17 you.
I think responsible gambling software should
18 be added to existing VLTs as soon as possible.
19 There should be no gambling by employees.
20 Certainly not during work hours, not after hours,
21 either.
This includes every Rhode Island Lottery
22 vendor.
Employees should not be allowed to buy
23 scratch tickets, play Keno, or anything else.
24 They can go across the street, but they shouldn't
<
34
1 be able to do it where they work.
2 In the past year we've treated five people
3 who worked as cashiers, clerks, bartenders who
4 have gotten into serious financial trouble, and
5 legal trouble in some cases.
Licensees whose
6 employees who routinely gamble on the premises
7 should be subject to severe penalties.
We've also
8 seen five patients from the casino industry, three
9 from Rhode Island and Lincoln who are employees
10 and two from the Connecticut casinos, and they all
11 gamble where they work.
12 Next, I'd like to see a mandatory open-door
13 policy for state or federally funded research
14 conducted on-site.
While I'm asking for things, I
15 thought I'd ask for everything.
Nobody has ever
16 done this, and I'll leave the reason up to your
17 imagination.
But the place to do this research is
18 in the casino; it's not in a laboratory.
I'd
19 severely limit cash machine access and check
20 cashing as well on gambling sites.
21 And, finally, I believe that this moritorium
22 on expansion should last until the above programs
23 are implemented and the results have been
24 evaluated.
Have we made a dent? Probably several
<
35
1 years at least.
2 Maximizing revenues in business and in
3 government is okay but not at any cost.
What's
4 the dollar cost of breaking up a family, having to
5 work well past your retirement age, or losing your
6 values? Please consider the recommendations I've
7 made, act with restraint and wisdom.
And thank
8 you for hearing me tonight.
9 REP. COSTANTINO: Thank you.
10 Representative Mumford.
11 REP. MUMFORD: Thank you, Dr. Breen for
12 your information.
It was quite informative.
I
13 have a number of questions.
The first one, at the
14 very beginning of your presentation you mentioned
15 that your funding came from the Department of
16 Health.
Is that your only funding or are you also
17 funded through Rhode Island Hospital?
18 DR. BREEN: That is our only funding.
19 For patients who have health insurance, we're
20 allowed to bill their health insurance.
For
21 patients whose health insurance is out of our
22 network or who have no insurance, we provide
23 treatment on demand; and that's what our portion
24 of the state funding for treatment goes towards.
<
36
1 REP. COSTANTINO: MHRH.
2 REP. MUMFORD: The next question I have,
3 as well you mentioned, and of course we all know,
4 that gambling by minors is illegal.
When you had
5 the age spread on one of your slides, do you ever
6 treat gamblers who are underage?
7 DR. BREEN: There was only one person in
8 the sample, and that was a 17 year old who began
9 gambling at Lincoln Park when he was 15 or so and
10 eventually got arrested for trespassing there and
11 was referred for an evaluation.
But it doesn't
12 come up that often.
13 REP. MUMFORD: One of my interests has
14 been proximity of all of our colleges and
15 universities to the two casinos we do have and any
16 new casino that may be proposed.
What about
17 college students? Do you have college students
18 who are any of your patients?
19 DR. BREEN: We do have a few college
20 students or college-age people.
Again, it's a
21 minority.
It's a small number.
And I'm not sure
22 why that is.
There might be something about
23 college students that precludes them from seeking
24 treatment.
Another idea that I have, because I've
<
37
1 done research at the University of Delaware when I
2 was getting my training there, is that, and maybe
3 some of your experts have alluded to this, the
4 prevalence rate of compulsive gambling is
5 extremely high in adolescents and college-age
6 people.
7 And that may be because they're on their own
8 for the first time and they're experimenting with
9 a lot of things.
So a freshman in college may
10 look like a compulsive gambler after six months
11 but they may mature out of that.
And that's a
12 theory, but I don't think that anyone has looked
13 at that longitudinally.
14 REP. MUMFORD: I was interested in that
15 aspect of it.
Also, the colleges and universities
16 have fairly sophisticated access to treatment
17 generally on campus.
Could it be handled in-house
18 and perhaps not make its way to Rhode Island
19 Hospital?
20 DR. BREEN: True, that could be an
21 explanation.
22 REP. MUMFORD: I have one other question.
23 Do you have any relation whatsoever with CODAC or
24 are they totally separate with the services they
<
38
1 provide?
2 DR. BREEN: We're basically two
3 completely separate treatment facilities.
And
4 Dr. Lesieur and I work hand in hand.
We are the
5 therapists for our program.
CODAC has a lot more
6 therapists and a lot more locations.
And I know
7 that you'll hear testimony from one of their
8 people in a couple of weeks.
9 REP. MUMFORD: Right.
I was aware of
10 Rhode Island Hospital's treatment program and also
11 CODAC.
Are there others that I'm not aware of?
12 Those are the only two?
13 DR. BREEN: In Rhode Island?
14 REP. MUMFORD: Yes, in Rhode Island.
15 DR. BREEN: I don't know of any others.
16 REP. MUMFORD: No, that is it.
Thank
17 you, very much for your excellent testimony,
18 Dr. Breen.
19 DR. BREEN: Thank you.
20 REP. COSTANTINO: Just a matter of -- and
21 I apologize for coming late, and I don't know if
22 -- the funding actually comes through the
23 Department of MHRH, the funding of hospitals.
24 DR. BREEN: Right.
<
39
1 REP. COSTANTINO: -- not the Department
2 of Health.
3 DR. BREEN: Okay.
My mistake.
4 REP. COSTANTINO: No, that's fine.
And
5 it really was an initiative that this committee
6 put through a couple years ago, a bill that I
7 sponsored, which allocated about $150,000,
8 actually a little more than that.
But I believe
9 150 is for treatment only.
10 DR. BREEN: Yeah.
11 REP. COSTANTINO: And there's about
12 $30,000 for some education and some prevention and
13 some training money for counselors.
I just wanted
14 to make that correction.
15 DR. BREEN: Thanks.
16 REP. SHERLOCK: In terms of your clients
17 discussing their losses, are there any data on
18 people who may not have reached the
19 classification --
20 DR. BREEN: Yes, DSM criteria.
21 REP. SHERLOCK: -- who record or discuss
22 their losses versus what they won? I never hear
23 people on the street or friends of mine discussing
24 what they lost.
They always tell me what they
<
40
1 won.
2 DR. BREEN: Yeah, that's how it goes.
3 REP. SHERLOCK: And then when you get to
4 the other questions, they begin to get vague.
Are
5 there any data on that?
6 DR. BREEN: First of all, I just thought
7 of this.
I've been working with problem gamblers
8 for seven or eight years now clinically, and I was
9 always amazed at how forthcoming they are when
10 they get one on one with a therapist.
It's almost
11 like they're bursting at the seams to tell
12 somebody because so much of this is hidden.
13 But to get back to the question you asked,
14 it's an excellent question because what you're
15 getting at is prevention.
What you're getting at
16 is primary prevention, in other words, getting to
17 somebody before they blow the IRA.
18 And I don't know that there's any good
19 literature on losses or things like that.
But you
20 could glean that data from, for example, the two
21 studies that I presented that were -- I believe
22 they were telephone surveys, but they had very,
23 very large samples, and they divided people into
24 non-gamblers, social gamblers, for lack of a
<
41
1 better word, and problem gamblers.
So you could
2 probably glean that data from what the social
3 gamblers reported.
4 As a matter of fact, I think one of the
5 statistics that I got from one of those studies is
6 that the problem people lost, on average, 17 times
7 what the social gambler or, what they probably
8 call, frequent players lost.
I don't know if that
9 answers your question.
10 REP. SHERLOCK: So you know the losses,
11 then, of the social gambler.
12 DR. BREEN: I don't.
I don't have that
13 data at my fingertips.
14 REP. SHERLOCK: You could derive that
15 through --
16 DR. BREEN: We could derive it.
And
17 another thing just occurred to me from the NORK
18 study, which is the University of Chicago study,
19 that I know probably Rachael Volberg talked about
20 that, that concluded that the vast majority of
21 people who gamble as part of their leisure
22 activity spend less than $500 per year.
23 And that's -- whether that's acceptable for
24 someone or not is an individual question.
But the
<
42
1 DSM IV diagnosed compulsive gambler spends many,
2 many, many, many thousands of dollars every year.
3 They spend money they don't have.
4 REP. SHERLOCK: The reasons for arriving
5 at your clinic doorstep, at what time in their
6 career or frustration or pathology do they arrive
7 at your --
8 DR. BREEN: There's a very large range
9 regarding that.
And I've been very pleased to see
10 in the last year people that have arrived at our
11 doorstep who haven't gone all the way and lost
12 every penny and who lost their marriages and lost
13 their homes.
They've gotten into some significant
14 debt and it stings quite a bit, and it may be this
15 treatment initiative and it may be the outreach
16 that we're doing that let's them know that there
17 is some place to call, and they're upset and
18 they're scared and they call.
19 And early intervention, so to speak, with a
20 person like that is a very good sign; and I would
21 say that a person like that has a great prognosis.
22 Another, another question that I don't know the
23 answer to, but my work on the progression of
24 gambling problems, especially in the machine
<
43
1 players, which is the most widespread area, tells
2 me that these people, many of them, have never
3 gambled seriously or regularly for much of their
4 lives until they're in their 40s and 50s, until
5 ten years ago when all of a sudden casinos are
6 available in the New England area, or until
7 there's a mid-life crisis or a divorce or an empty
8 nest or something like that.
9 And these people find through chance, I
10 guess, or a social visit that the machines are
11 really fun and really get them out of their
12 depression or their lonliness, or whatever it is
13 that they're going through.
14 But the problem there is, as I alluded to,
15 they're so fast and they're so hypnotic that a
16 person can create the problems for oneself on a
17 machine financially, psychologically, family wise,
18 employment wise in a year that would take an old
19 time horse race gambler five or ten years to build
20 up to.
And part of the reason is that continuity
21 of that form of gambling.
As fast as you can push
22 that botton, you can bet.
23 REP. SHERLOCK: What are the referral
24 triggers? Are most of them self-referral or
<
44
1 someone in their family, a spouse or a friend?
2 DR. BREEN: I was going to say,
3 obviously, obviously, a spouse or friend or a
4 family member, money problems, depression, as I
5 pointed out in maybe 75 percent of our people.
6 REP. SHERLOCK: Do you have data on that?
7 DR. BREEN: Yeah, it was in the
8 presentation.
I believe it was 76 percent with a
9 current depressive disorder.
10 REP. SHERLOCK: Oh, that's a little bit
11 different question.
That's describing the nature
12 of their problem.
I was asking --
13 DR. BREEN: Okay.
I understand.
14 REP. SHERLOCK: -- what or who triggers
15 the referral.
16 DR. BREEN: Unfortunately, unfortunately,
17 I don't have that data, because, frankly, there's
18 a limit to the amount of data that I can collect.
19 REP. SHERLOCK: Because I think that
20 those kind of data would also help our
21 understanding of how we can influence people
22 who --
23 DR. BREEN: Well, as I said, you know, my
24 sense is that largely family members are involved
<
45
1 or people are self-referred because they feel very
2 bad, very depressed, very scared, very upset over
3 the money they've lost, people are calling them,
4 bill collectors.
5 REP. SHERLOCK: All right.
Thank you.
6 Representative Costantino.
7 REP. COSTANTINO: Yeah, I have a few
8 questions.
I would -- your program must be
9 monitored and evaluated by MHRH, like I would
10 assume most of the drug and alcohol -- the
11 substance abuse programs are in that department.
12 DR. BREEN: Yes.
13 REP. COSTANTINO: Which means they do ask
14 questions, and I don't know -- I would hope that
15 they are asking you to fill out some forms as it
16 regards referral source and maybe other possible
17 addictive issues.
And it may be wise, Mr.
18 Chairman, if maybe we have someone from MHRH come
19 to one of our hearings who are monitoring both
20 programs, CODAC and Rhode Island Hospital, to kind
21 of give us an overview of what they've collected
22 in terms of data at this point.
23 DR. BREEN: Sure.
I can tell you from my
24 end that I give them an update every three months.
<
46
1 I don't have it in front of me, but it has, it has
2 age catagories --
3 REP. COSTANTINO: Right.
4 DR. BREEN: -- racial background.
I
5 don't think --
6 REP. COSTANTINO: Kind of a demographics
7 of the program.
8 DR. BREEN: Yeah, but I don't think we
9 have a referral source.
10 REP. COSTANTINO: I know they ask that on
11 substance abuse, so...
12 DR. BREEN: Now, as for the effectiveness
13 of treatment, Dr. Lesieur and I developed the
14 follow-up that was to be used with both programs.
15 We took that upon ourselves and we developed it.
16 We used the GSI, which is a gambling module, the
17 ASI, the SOGS, and a bunch of other questions; and
18 part of my presentation was the follow-up data for
19 the Rhode Island Hospital Program.
20 REP. COSTANTINO: So the ASI is part of
21 it?
22 DR. BREEN: The GSI.
23 REP. COSTANTINO: The GSI.
24 DR. BREEN: Just get the gambling module.
<
47
1 REP. COSTANTINO: Okay.
So if there are
2 individuals within the program that are, let's use
3 the term, dual diagnosed -- although we know it is
4 something else but certainly it has application in
5 this -- is there a way to know that --
6 DR. BREEN: Sure.
7 REP. COSTANTINO: -- with the information
8 you're giving to the Department?
9 DR. BREEN: Yes, yeah.
Actually, they
10 ask that question specifically.
And, again, part
11 of our program is a very comprehensive psychiatric
12 evaluation.
So I presented data of the number of
13 people with current and with past resolve
14 substance abuse problems in our patient sample.
15 It's about, it's about 18 percent current, some
16 sort of current substance dependence or abuse,
17 alcohol or drugs, and about 18 percent past.
So
18 they had a substance abuse problem in the past and
19 now their problem is gambling.
20 REP. COSTANTINO: One other issue I'd
21 like to discuss.
I've been always amazed about
22 the term "problem gambling," the term itself,
23 because I kind of cringe when I hear terms like
24 that, only in the sense that I remember that at
<
48
1 one time we used to call people "problem
2 drinkers," and it kind of diminished what the
3 problem really is.
4 And in the past meetings that we've had here,
5 I've heard problem gambling, I've heard compulsive
6 gambling, and I've heard gambling addiction.
7 DR. BREEN: You left out pathological.
8 REP. COSTANTINO: And also pathological
9 gambling.
And it sometimes reminds me of how we
10 used to call people who were addicts on the street
11 "addicts."
But when a physician had an addiction,
12 he was impaired.
And it kind of, like, there's a
13 status associated with the problem.
And depending
14 upon what your status is is really what you're
15 called.
16 But the issue I have is at some point, I
17 mean, when does a problem become compulsive?
18 Because I would suspect that in most cases if your
19 alcoholism or your drug abuse is causing problems,
20 that you're probably addicted.
Severely -- I
21 mean, you know, when do you go from a social
22 drinker to a, or as we say a casual user, to an
23 addict?
24 I'm concerned with the field, because I've
<
49
1 been in the addictions fields for quite a long
2 time, about 15 years.
And I've seen where at one
3 time alcoholism -- alcoholism profession and drug
4 abuse profession didn't talk to each other because
5 of whether it was billing issues or third party
6 reimbursement issues or just the evolution of the
7 field.
8 I'm just not -- what terms should we really
9 be using with this issue?
10 DR. BREEN: That's a good question.
And
11 I sort of set up my talk by saying that I use
12 "compulsive," "pathological," "problem gambler"
13 interchangeably.
I mean, those words just come
14 out here and there.
In therapy, I let a person
15 decide what they want to call themselves.
I don't
16 care.
I use "problem gambler" probably because,
17 as you noted, it seems to be part of the
18 nomenclature now.
And it has -- some people would
19 argue that it has less of a stigma.
You mentioned
20 the stigma.
21 But let me be clear.
I labeled a lot of my
22 slides and I said "problem gambling" a lot in my
23 testimony.
I'm referring to severe chronic
24 pathological gamblers who don't score five out of
<
50
1 ten DSM IV criteria, they are scoring eight, nine,
2 or ten.
And they have done significant damage to
3 their financial stability, to their marriage, to
4 their job and, in some cases, they've risked their
5 own freedom.
6 What should we call it? I don't know.
It's
7 arbitrary, in my opinion.
8 REP. COSTANTINO: And it always worries
9 me in cases like that where something -- take
10 someone who may be extremely wealthy and say the
11 gambling -- the addiction is there, but the
12 addiction isn't really causing a problem because
13 there's just so many resources.
And that's
14 probably a rare case.
15 DR. BREEN: It could happen, but, you
16 know what, I'm skeptical.
17 REP. COSTANTINO: And so am I.
18 DR. BREEN: Did you ever hear of Lenny
19 Tose who owned the Philadelphia Eagles?
20 REP. COSTANTINO: Oh, yeah, yes.
21 DR. BREEN: He gambled away the
22 Philadelphia Eagles --
23 REP. COSTANTINO: Right.
Exactly.
24 DR. BREEN: -- at a table --
<
51
1 REP. COSTANTINO: And that's why I get
2 concerned about something just being a problem
3 rather than an adiction or --
4 DR. BREEN: Interesting that -- and you
5 have a substance abuse background in that field,
6 and so do I, that's how I started out.
And I
7 described -- I use a model, I use an addiction
8 model in treatment and that is my philosophy.
And
9 that is how I explain it to my clients, and they
10 don't argue with that.
They rarely, if ever,
11 don't identify it with that.
They say, yes, you
12 know, I feel better now that someone has said that
13 they understand that there's something going on in
14 my brain when I gamble.
There's Dopamine flying
15 around in my brain, and I am out of control,
16 because there are a lot of similarities.
17 REP. COSTANTINO: Getting back to the
18 model, and if I could ask you just to maybe think
19 outside of the box for a moment.
20 DR. BREEN: Okay.
21 REP. COSTANTINO: And what would be your
22 ideal comprehensive treatment system? Now, mind
23 you, just to put things in context, we have
24 services -- major gaps in services for alcohol and
<
52
1 substance abuse, and we still do.
But just in
2 terms of gambling addiction, what would be --
3 because we have residential, we have -- we don't
4 really have residential, and I don't know if there
5 is a residential program --
6 DR. BREEN: For gambling.
7 REP. COSTANTINO: -- or even nationally
8 somewhere for gambling addiction.
And I'm sure
9 maybe some of the psychiatric hospitals have maybe
10 made some models to fit the issue.
But from
11 outpatient to residential inpatient, after care,
12 do you have a model, what would be called an ideal
13 model, that this committee could review in terms
14 of what would be an ideal system of care for the
15 gambling problem?
16 DR. BREEN: What I would like to see, in
17 a perfect world if funding wasn't a problem, would
18 be an intensive outpatient model that people could
19 elect to enter and attend everyday for five days,
20 everyday for a week or for two weeks, and come in
21 in the morning and have psychoeducational classes,
22 individual and group therapy, and go home in the
23 evening to get them, to get them started, you
24 know, to enter treatment running.
<
53
1 I don't think everybody needs that.
And the
2 other side of that is that we have a very
3 individualized program.
I use motivational
4 interviewing a lot.
You know, people have their
5 own ideas about what they want to change and what
6 they don't want to change and what they want their
7 gambling to look like 12 months from now.
And I
8 try to meet them where they're at.
9 Some people are severe and have intense urges
10 to gamble and intense impulses everyday and they
11 need to come in at least weekly.
We can't do that
12 weekly at this point.
But other people quickly
13 will fall into an every other week pattern, go
14 down to once a month, come back for tune-ups once
15 in awhile.
16 So I would, you know, I would want to keep
17 the individualized component, but I would want to
18 go strongly in the direction of being able to
19 offer a more intense program for people who are
20 really in crisis and can do that for a week or two
21 to get them going.
22 REP. COSTANTINO: So you don't see the
23 need, or maybe there isn't a critical mass, for
24 the need to pull the person out of the environment
<
54
1 in terms of a residential program or inpatient
2 program?
3 DR. BREEN: That's a good question.
And
4 I understand the rationale behind it, getting them
5 out of the environment and in the hospital for 28
6 days --
7 REP. COSTANTINO: We don't do 28 days.
8 We haven't done 28 days in years, but it's nice to
9 hear again, though.
10 DR. BREEN: The only inpatient gambling
11 program I think that's still running is at the
12 V.A. at Brecksville, Ohio, which has been up and
13 running for 30 years.
But that's a different
14 scenario.
You know, that's a double-edged sword.
15 REP. COSTANTINO: And that's why I said
16 this is an ideal system to think outside the box
17 because --
18 DR. BREEN: Here's my inclination.
I say
19 it's a double-edged sword because I usually say
20 something to my patients like, you know, gambling
21 is everywhere and this is a small place and it's
22 only five minutes from your house and you put on
23 your TV and you see the commercials and they're
24 saying "Come on and do it," and you go to buy milk
<
55
1 and eggs and they're scratching scratch tickets,
2 and you put on -- you go to the movies and it's
3 portrayed in movies.
It's a very popular subject.
4 REP. COSTANTINO: As is alcohol.
5 DR. BREEN: It's on the history channel.
6 I mean, it's everywhere.
I say something like,
7 you know, it's never going to go away, they're not
8 going too close, they're going to get bigger and
9 bigger and bigger, probably, so I guess you're
10 going to have to do -- you're going to have to
11 change something that you're doing.
12 So, you know, to put somebody in an
13 antiseptic environment for a time, probably has
14 its advantages.
But it also doesn't let them -- I
15 don't know, how would I say it -- inoculate
16 themselves and go -- you know, in a day program,
17 learning coping skills and stuff like that and
18 then going out at night to practice those
19 skills --
20 REP. COSTANTINO: Wouldn't the issue
21 be -- just assume that there was a problem, would
22 it be really when you leave the program, you have
23 something, you're not just leaving and going home,
24 but there's an after-care program or an outpatient
<
56
1 program after.
2 DR. BREEN: Sure.
3 REP. COSTANTINO: You're not just --
4 because I would suspect, even though using
5 addiction models, that there's actually some sort
6 of psychological withdrawal from --
7 DR. BREEN: Absolutely.
8 REP. COSTANTINO: -- from gambling.
9 DR. BREEN: Absolutely.
And I don't --
10 another thing I'm fond of saying to my patients
11 is -- they're usually depressed, and I don't know
12 if they're depressed because they gamble or
13 because they're depressed.
14 But what I see often is that they get more
15 depressed because they miss gambling.
It takes up
16 a lot of their time and a lot of their energy.
17 And getting over the first step of accepting that
18 it's over for whatever reason -- the money, it's
19 gone, you're never going to get it back, it
20 doesn't belong to you anymore -- that's a tough
21 pill to swollow.
22 And one of the things that we work on that's
23 most of what we do is bar from cognitive
24 behavioral treatment of substance use disorders,
<
57
1 we work on leisure activities and filling up that
2 void.
We've got to get them out and try to enjoy
3 other things.
But it is a loss.
4 Just today or yesterday somebody described it
5 like a death in the family.
And that's what it
6 can feel like.
7 REP. COSTANTINO: I have one last
8 question.
And that is, do you feel that MHRH with
9 having the addiction -- the substance abuse,
10 Division of Substance Abuse, there is the right
11 home for the gambling monies?
12 DR. BREEN: I think the right home for
13 the gambling monies is at Rhode Island Hospital.
14 REP. COSTANTINO: Well, I'm talking about
15 as it comes through us.
We appropriate the money.
16 DR. BREEN: I don't really have an
17 opinion about that.
18 REP. COSTANTINO: Okay.
Thank you.
19 REP. SHERLOCK: Talking about the
20 environment, just as an aside, at one of the major
21 supermarket chains now you can get a scratch
22 ticket --
23 DR. BREEN: Oh, for free, with your
24 purchase?
<
58
1 REP. SHERLOCK: Not put out by the
2 Lottery Commission but put out by that company.
3 And you can scratch it as dollar amounts.
4 DR. BREEN: Right.
5 REP. SHERLOCK: And if you don't win and
6 you scratch the bottom, you might get 37 cents off
7 Draino or something, which, you know, if you save
8 enough of them, I guess you could do a shopping
9 one day.
But --
10 DR. BREEN: Would take a lot of tickets.
11 REP. SHERLOCK: But that's permeating the
12 environment.
You can see someone exiting your
13 program and going shopping for bread and milk and
14 getting a scratch ticket.
15 DR. BREEN: And to get back to what you
16 were talking about, Mr. Costantino, that's -- you
17 know, it's so pervasive that I am torn about the
18 decision between having an intensive inpatient or
19 partial hospital program and just letting somebody
20 go out there and face the problem, face the fear.
21 REP. SHERLOCK: Last question from me and
22 then we'll go to Representative Mumford.
Is there
23 any group work done?
24 DR. BREEN: Yeah, we have a group that
<
59
1 meets one night a week.
2 REP. SHERLOCK: But it's like -- that's
3 more like a support group?
4 DR. BREEN: It's an hour-and-a-half.
It
5 is -- how would you describe it? It's
6 psychoeducational support group.
It's not
7 completely structured, certainly not rigid.
As
8 issues come up with patients, we deal with them;
9 but we also have a plan, we have a sequence of
10 eight or nine topics that we bring and we present.
11 Sometimes it's much more structured than other
12 times.
13 But, again, it's barred from cognitive
14 behavioral treatment of substance disorders.
So
15 we talk about things like coping skills and we
16 talk about things like relapse prevention.
And we
17 do a really neat segment of probability and
18 gamblers' fallacies and how slot machines work and
19 all that sort of thing.
20 REP. SHERLOCK: Okay.
Thank you.
21 Representative Mumford.
22 REP. MUMFORD: Thank you, Representative
23 Sherlock.
Dr. Breen, I was very interested in
24 your listing of average debt for your problem
<
60
1 gamblers.
And you mentioned 33,000 outstanding in
2 credit cards, 34,000 assets sold with perhaps
3 financial damage of 59,000.
4 Now, when we have a college or university in
5 a city that does not pay taxes, they are very
6 quick to put together an economic impact
7 assessment, which shows that even though they do
8 not pay taxes within a city or town, their
9 multiplier effect or their economic impact is such
10 that they are truly putting all this into the
11 economy.
12 With the 59,000 that you've listed for the
13 individual, is there any negative multiplier or
14 economic impact that we're able to derive from
15 that so in addition to having the individual lose
16 that money, there's also money lost from the
17 surrounding community, such as people that sell
18 refrigerators or those who sell other goods that
19 the individual would perhaps have been purchasing
20 if he had not lost?
21 Do you know if any study exists that would
22 quantify with a 59,000 figure just what the
23 economic impact or the multiplier effect would be?
24 DR. BREEN: Honestly, I don't know if
<
61
1 that study exists for problem gamblers.
Now, my
2 knowledge is more clinical than anything else; and
3 I've certainly, certainly heard plenty of people
4 say they couldn't buy a car because of their
5 gambling debts or they couldn't pay the mortgage
6 because of their gambling debts or they couldn't
7 go on vacation because of their gambling debts.
8 But that's really getting out of my area, and
9 I wouldn't have a clue how to figure that out.
10 REP. MUMFORD: I was wondering because
11 we're seaching all the information now and I have
12 yet to really find a definitive study that was the
13 economic impact of the negativity of gambling.
14 And I was just wondered whether or not you were
15 aware if one existed.
16 DR. BREEN: I couldn't say.
17 REP. MUMFORD: No.
Thank you, Dr. Breen.
18 DR. BREEN: Sure.
19 REP. SHERLOCK: Thank you, Representative
20 Mumford.
Any further questions of members of the
21 committee?
22 (NO RESPONSE)
23 REP. SHERLOCK: All right.
Dr. Breen, we
24 deeply appreciate --
<
62
1 DR. BREEN: Thank you.
2 REP. SHERLOCK: -- your input, your
3 presentation, and we'll -- hopefully we'll stay in
4 touch.
5 DR. BREEN: Okay.
6 REP. SHERLOCK: Okay.
Thank you, very
7 much.
There are no other witnesses signed up for
8 the meeting, so that will conclude the hearing.
9 We'll be meeting next week on Tuesday at five
10 o'clock.
Thank you, very much.
