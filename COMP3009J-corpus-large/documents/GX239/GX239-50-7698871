NMFS FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTERS The National Marine Fisheries Service is a world leader in fisheries research.
Each year the agency uses harvest and survey data to assess the status and trends of more than 200 major commercially-valuable fish and shellfish stocks.
The NMFS Science Centers provide annual stock assessment information and management advice to support the NOAA stewardship mission for the living marine resources in their regions.
These cross disciplinary efforts are undertaken in cooperation with other Federal and state agencies, international organizations, the fishing industry, and academia, and are based on long standing cooperative research agreements.
In addition to these basic responsibilities, each regional Science Center has unique capabilities to focus on special research needs.
The following is an overview of each of the NMFS Science Centers.
ALASKA FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER (AFSC) The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has research facilities in Alaska (Auke Bay and Kodiak Island), Washington (Seattle), and Oregon (Newport).
Organizationally, the AFSC consists of the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE), the Resource Ecology and Fisheries Management Division (REFM), the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), the Auke Bay Laboratory (ABL), and other administrative units.
The major shipboard platforms supporting the AFSC include the NOAA fishery survey vessels Miller Freeman and John N. Cobb, as well as chartered vessels from Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Western the fishing industry.
The new fishery survey vessel, Regional Campus, Seattle, Washington.
NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson will be commissioned in the fall of 2004.
Homeport for the Oscar Dyson will be Kodiak, AK; the first research cruise will take place in February, 2005.
The Center has numerous ongoing relationships with external cooperators, including state and other Federal agencies, academic institutions, foreign research institutions, the fishing industry, and resource conservation organizations.
The Center has a permanent staff of about 365 employees in support of fisheries and marine mammal research in the coastal and offshore waters of Alaska.
This marine region of nearly three million square miles includes over 50% of the U.S. coastline and over 70% of the U.S. continental shelf.
The region supports some of the most important commercial fisheries in the world, particularly groundfish and Pacific salmon species.
It is also host to some of the world's largest populations of marine mammals and seabirds.
47
The Center focuses research on the following fishery resources that support major commercial fisheries off Alaska: Â· Groundfish in the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands (BSAI) region including separate catch quotas for 14 individual species or stocks and 4 species complexes.
These management complexes include: shortraker/rougheye rockfish, other flatfish (15 species), other rockfish (8 species, including thornyheads), and squid.
Groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) region including separate catch quotas for 11 individual species or stocks and 6 species complexes.
The management complexes include: shortraker/rougheye rockfish, deep water flatfish, shallow water flatfish, other slope rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, and demersal shelf rockfish.
The remaining groundfish species managed as separate "other species" groups in the BSAI and GOA regions.
These management groups include species of sculpin, skate, shark and octopuses.
Eight species of skate, over 50 species of sculpins, 3 species of sharks and 4 species of octopus are occasionally caught in groundfish fisheries.
Commercial and scientific interest in these species is growing, while research efforts are underway to improve our knowledge of their life history, abundance and interactions with commercial fisheries.
Shellfish including king, tanner, snow, and hybrid crabs, several species of shrimps and sea snails.
The five major Pacific salmon species (chinook, chum, sockeye, pink and coho) and steelhead that have supported strong traditional salmon fisheries along the entire Alaskan coastline.
Â·
Â·
Â· Â·
In addition to research on fishery resources, the Center has recently initiated new studies that will help predict how marine resources respond to climate change, the nature and location of habitat resources required by commercially valuable fish species, and habitat interactions between fish and marine mammals.
Direct research on marine mammals includes stock assessments for most marine mammal species of Alaska, as required by the MMPA and for those species also listed under the .
This information, in turn, is used to assess anthropogenic impacts, including direct (e.g. incidental take) and indirect effects (e.g. competition) of fisheries on those populations.
The Center also conducts research on habitat use by FMP-managed fish and invertebrates, alterations in habitat quality through human and environmental change, and an understanding of threats to habitat in Alaska.
Studies involve diverse fish habitats that range from eelgrass beds to benthic substrates, and wetlands to coral and sponge communities which serve as refugia, forage grounds, or nursery areas for managed species.
Perturbations include fishing, oil transportation, logging, and development, plus natural effects on fish habitat such as climate, prey distribution and nutritional quality.

Recent Accomplishments and Research Priorities for FY 2004-2009 I. Research to Support Fishery Conservation and Management
Recent Accomplishments: Major research cruises conducted by the AFSC included: (1) the annual winter fishery acoustic surveys aboard the NOAA Ship Miller Freeman to estimate the biomass and distribution of pollock in Steller sea lion critical habitat around the Shumagin Islands, southeastern Bering Sea (including the Bogoslof Island area), Shelikof Straits and along the eastern side of Kodiak Island; (2) a summer longline charter vessel survey to assess the distribution and abundance of sablefish, rockfish, and other commercially important groundfish resources in the Gulf of Alaska; (3) a biennial summer bottom trawl survey of the Gulf of Alaska shelf and continental slope groundfish with three chartered fishing vessels to estimate the biomass and distribution of groundfish and to collect other biological data; (4) a pilot summer fishery acoustic survey aboard the NOAA Ship Miller Freeman to determine the feasibility of conducting a biennial summer Gulf of Alaska survey to estimate the distribution and abundance of pollock off bottom over the shelf; (5) a summer bottom trawl survey of eastern Bering Sea shelf with two chartered fishing vessels to estimate distribution and abundance of crab Research scientist monitors survey trackline during and groundfish stocks, (6) an annual bottom trawl an acoustic/trawl survey of pollock aboard the survey for shrimp in Pavlof Bay; (7) spring, summer NOAA R/V Miller Freeman in the Gulf of Alaska.
and fall surface trawl surveys by the NOAA Ship John N. Cobb to determine abundance, migration patterns, ecology, bioenergetics and carrying capacity for juvenile salmon in Southeast Alaska waters; and (8) fall surface trawl surveys of the eastern Bering Sea shelf and basin with chartered vessels to determine distribution, relative biomass, habitat, and ecology of western Alaskan salmonids.
The AFSC runs an observer program to collect information from the federally-regulated fisheries of Alaska.
The observer program collected valuable data on the target fishery resource for the purpose of stock assessment.
In addition, the observer program estimated the levels of direct, incidental takes of all protected species in Alaska's federally-regulated fisheries, including seabirds, prohibited species of fish, and marine mammals.
The AFSC had the lead responsibility for analyzing the population dynamics and status of most of the groundfish species managed by FMPs in the Bering Sea-Aleutians and the Gulf of Alaska regions.
The AFSC, in cooperation with the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), conducted a number of Fisheries Oceanography Coordinated Investigations (FOCI) research cruises with the support of GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics), the Steller sea lion research program, and the North Pacific Research Board.
These studies examined the
49
environmental and biological factors affecting the spatial distribution and relative abundance of juvenile pollock in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, particularly with respect to their role in the ecosystem and importance as prey for Steller sea lions.
The AFSC conducted studies on salmon ocean ecology, species life histories, and historical data patterns to increase our understanding of how marine and anadromous species are affected by natural and human activities.
The AFSC, in cooperation with the NPAFC, initiated an international survey titled Bering Aleutian Salmon International Survey (BASIS), to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of environmental variation and density-dependence on salmon carrying capacity in the Bering Sea for sustainable conservation of salmon stocks In 2002, AFSC scientists discovered dense aggregations of deep-water corals and sponge in the Aleutian Islands area and have initiated studies of their distribution and biology.
The AFSC conducted restoration studies stemming from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, particularly those relating to the abundance and biological availability of lingering oil.
The AFSC in collaboration with Alaska Department of Fish and Game conducted a sequence of research cruises in the northeastern Bering Sea using chartered fishing vessels to determine the annual cycle in maturity and the reproductive biology of snow crab.
The research was followed by two research cruises aboard two chartered vessels to design and evaluate bycatch reduction devices for the reduction of salmon bycatch in pollock midwater trawl fisheries.
These cruises were conducted with the full collaboration of the pollock fishing and trawl gear industries.
The AFSC scientists with expertise in conducting bottom trawl surveys lead the development of national trawl survey standardization protocols.
Under the orders of NOAA Administrator VADM Lautenbacher, the objective of this project was to develop and publish a standard set of protocols for all aspects of trawl survey preparation and execution to ensure that data meet the highest quality standards and that consistency is maintained from one survey to the next.
The national report was submitted and approved on schedule.
A team of AFSC survey biologists compiled the first edition of the At-Sea Safety Manual to educate our scientists about unsafe situations and practices while working aboard chartered fishing vessels conducting trawl surveys.
The team will review and update the document on an annual basis.
AFSC scientists have recently completed a major atlas of ichthyoplankton abundance and distribution patterns in the northeast Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea ecosystems.
The atlas

50
contains detailed information on the early life stages of 103 fish taxa and will be readily available to a wide range of investigators both in print form and on-line.
The NMML conducted research to determine the status, conservation needs, and potential impacts of fishing activities on marine mammals of Alaska.
Based on data collected by the Center's observer program, federally-regulated fisheries are not considered to have a direct, incidental take level of marine mammals high enough to warrant management action.
However, indirect interactions between some commercial fisheries and some species of marine mammals (e.g. Steller sea lions and northern fur seals) may potentially occur.
Research to resolve whether and to what extent these interactions occur has included surveys of marine mammal forage fish and the collection of detailed foraging information.
The NMML worked closely with the Alaska Scientific Review Group (ASRG) to determine the status of marine mammal stocks in Alaska.
The ASRG includes representatives from Alaskan universities, the Alaska Native community, and the commercial fishing industry.
The AFSC (ABL) completed radio-tagging studies on Yukon River chinook and fall chum salmon that documented spawning location, migration rates, and estimated numbers crossing the border into Canada.
Genetic baseline information on salmonids was assembled to identify stocks or country of origin.
AFSC scientists are key partners in Coastal Fish Habitat Restoration design, application of new aquatic habitat restoration technologies and in developing the database needed to test the effectiveness of those restoration designs.

Recent Accomplishments: The AFSC continues to conduct research cruises and to analyze results of recent surveys to measure the direct effects of bottom trawling on seafloor habitat in eastern and central Gulf of Alaska, eastern Bering Sea, and the Aleutian Islands.
Some of the major accomplishments were: (1) the assessment of changes to the seafloor caused by chronic long-term trawling in softbottom areas in the Gulf of Alaska; (2) the examination of possible adverse effects of bottom trawls on soft-bottom benthos in the eastern Bering Sea; (3) the evaluation of acoustic technology for seabed classification; (4) the assessment of impacts to habitat areas of particular concern (HAPC) such as gorgonian corals; (5) the documentation of the effects of trawling on hard bottom habitat in the Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska; and (6) the mapping of the areas by sediment types.
The AFSC worked cooperatively with the pollock midwater fishing vessels to design and evaluate a bycatch reduction device to reduce the bycatch of salmon in their midwater trawls.
With the funding support of the North Pacific Research Board, the first observations were made on the capture behavior of salmon in a midwater trawl targeting on pollock.
Based on these results, fishermen working with AFSC scientists have developed and evaluated a number of Schematic drawing of a commercial bottom trawl possible designs in a large tow tank in eastern Canada.
that has been modified to reduce bycatch of flatfish These designs have been refined and will be evaluated in the Alaskan fishery for Pacific cod. at sea late this summer on a charter vessel.
The most promising design will then be used in a commercial operation to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing bycatch of both chinook and chum salmon in the eastern Bering Sea pollock fisheries under actual fishing conditions.
If these trials prove effective, then the industry will likely start installing the net modifications for their 2004 fisheries The NMML worked closely with the Northwest Regional Office and the Makah tribe to develop methods for deterring the incidental mortality of harbor porpoise in salmon gill nets.
The development of an acoustic pinger resulted in a significant reduction in marine mammal bycatch.
57
AFSC scientists carried out laboratory experiments on live fish at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, OR to determine the impact of stress from capture processes on the behavior and survival of important bycatch species in trawl and longline fisheries.
This research provided insights on the key principals which control fish mortality by integrating analysis of behavioral and physiological assays and observed mortality.
Recent work with sablefish and Pacific halibut have shown that environmental factors, including temperature and air exposure can interact with gear stressors to magnify mortality and susceptibility to stress and mortality.
Studies related to the condition of juvenile pollock escaping through codend meshes found that juvenile pollock are a `fragile species', significantly impaired and more vulnerable to predation after escapement from a simulated trawl codend.
Research Priorities, FY 2004-2009: Â· Â· Continue to conduct research to measure direct effects of bottom trawling on seafloor habitat according to a five-year research plan.
Conduct fishing gear performance and fish behavioral studies to reduce bycatch and bycatch mortality of prohibited, undersized, or unmarketable species, and to understand performance of survey gear.
Work with industry and the Council to develop bycatch reduction techniques.

The stock assessment process of the AFSC undergoes periodic review internally and externally throughout the years.
AFSC scientists participated as scientific advisors to bilateral technical committees in various international salmon fora including the U.S.- Canada Pacific Salmon and Yukon Treaty accords and the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC).
The AFSC database for bottom trawl surveys is undergoing a major restructuring to include all the catch, haul, specimen, and effort data that are being routinely collected.
The design is nearly complete and populating the new data base has begun thanks to ESDIM funding support.
The AFSC provided guidelines to assist the Councils in assessing and specifying MSY for managed fisheries.
The AFSC (REFM Division) has the lead role for defining and estimating the MSY levels for all the groundfish stocks managed in the BSAI and GOA area.
The information helps the NPFMC determine the relative status of the stocks to historical levels.
The AFSC also has the lead role in defining and estimating the overfishing levels for each of the groundfish stocks managed in the BSAI and GOA area.
These maximum fishing levels guide the NPFMC to manage exploitation of the stocks within biologically safe levels.
The AFSC (REFM) provided the technical lead role to develop objective and measurable criteria for stocks that are overfished or approaching an overfished condition.
The definitions were used as uniform applications throughout NMFS.
These definitions would standardize the criteria for determining depleted stocks due to fishing and other causes throughout the nation.
The AFSC provided technical expertise and analysis in environmental impact statements involving Alaska groundfish fisheries.
The AFSC is developing ecosystem-based indicators and assessments.
This information is being integrated into documents provided to fishery managers in support of ecosystem-based management.

The Center's research brings together a number of disciplines including, fisheries science, marine biology and ecology, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, oceanography, and physiology.
Organizationally, the Center consists of the Conservation Biology Division, the Environmental Conservation Division, the Fish Ecology Division, the Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division, and the Resource Enhancement and Utilization Technologies Division.
In addition, the Center has Socioeconomics, Marine Mammal, and Science Synthesis and Coordination programs.
Across these five divisions and programs, NWFSC scientists and staff conduct research in five primary areas: Â· Status of stocksÂ­Center scientists conduct and NOAA R/V Miller Freeman.
coordinate stock assessments for West Coast groundfish and salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest by taking a variety of measurements, analyzing the data, and using mathematical models to draw conclusions from the results.
These assessments are one tool used by managers to identify overfished and threatened stocks and set biologically sustainable harvest levels.
Â· Human Caused Stress/RisksÂ­Center scientists conduct research to better understand how salmon, marine fish, and marine mammals react to these stresses and to quantify, assess, and minimize these risks.
The Center's research provides the underpinning for management decisions.
Â· Ecosystem and Climate CharacteristicsÂ­Center scientists conduct research on physical and biological processes that influence aquatic, marine, and estuarine ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest, as well as the effects of invasive species, toxic phytoplankton, climate change, and natural environmental fluctuations.
Â· Recover and Rebuild SpeciesÂ­Center scientists study genetic variation and conduct research on the population structure of salmon, marine fish, and killer whales.
The Center also develops innovative recovery tools like captive broodstock programs to propagate salmon species, new techniques for rearing hatchery fish, and culture techniques to rear marine fish.
In addition, Center scientists are directly involved in salmon recovery planning efforts on the west coast.
Â· Innovation and TechnologyÂ­Center scientists are taking a lead role in developing and applying technologies, techniques, and tools to support conservation and recovery of the Pacific Northwest's living marine resources.
Over the years, the Center's innovative and original research has helped establish new aquaculture endeavors, seafood processing techniques, dam passage equipment and techniques, methods to detect and evaluate harmful algal blooms, and technology to integrate and track important fisheries dependent data, as well as to identify and monitor marine and anadromous fish populations.
The Center has lead responsibility in the region to study and provide state-of-the-art scientific information on the following primary living marine resources.
63
Â· Pacific SalmonÂ­Fifty-two populations of salmon and steelhead exist on the west coast, twenty-six of which are listed as endangered or threatened under the .
Â· West Coast GroundfishÂ­The west coast groundfish fishery includes some 80 commercially fished stocks and supports millions of dollars in economic activity and many livelihoods.
The Center coordinates NMFS' Groundfish Program on the west coast.
Â· Killer WhalesÂ­The Southern Resident killer whale populations was recently listed as depleted under the MMPA.
The Center has developed a research plan to address possible causes for the killer whale decline and to gain a better understanding of the physiology, ecology, and behavior of these whales.
As part of the Center's studies of these living marine resources, Center scientist also conduct research that helps predict how marine resources respond to environmental variability and climate change, the nature and location of habitat resources required by commercially valuable fish species, and habitat interactions between fish and marine mammals.
The NWFSC develops and maintains strong collaborative partnerships with state and federal agencies, industry, environmental groups, Native American tribes, individual fishers, universities, and other research and academic institutions.
The Center also provides opportunities for students in marine research, technology, and library science through cooperative research agreements with regional universities and councils.
NWFSC research supports critical management decisions.
Center scientists continually strive to improve the state-of-the-art of the scientific information they provide.
Recent Accomplishments and Research Priorities for FY2004-2009 I. Research to Support Fishery Conservation and Management
Recent Accomplishments The NWFSC developed comprehensive research plans for west coast groundfish, hatchery science, socioeconomics, watershed ecology, and Pacific salmon to ensure that all relevant scientific information is available to regional managers and policy makers.
All plans were reviewed by external scientists and constituents.
The Center convened a series of program reviews using external panels of scientists to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of the Center's science in three major areas: artificial propagation, ocean and estuarine ecology, and watershed ecology and recovery planning.
The NWFSC conducted extensive assessments of west coast groundfish species and analyzed the potential for rebuilding species classified as overfished.
Center scientists completed stock assessments for Pacific whiting and canary and yelloweye rockfish, updated the stock assessment for sablefish, and coordinated rebuilding analyses for widow and darkblotched rockfish.
64
The Center expanded its annual series of slope species surveys from Cape Flattery, WA to the Mexican border (previously surveys ended at Morro Bay, CA).
The Center also expanded these surveys to include both shelf and slope trawl collections.
This combined survey is designed to provide comprehensive information on the status of ecologically and economically important groundfish populations.
A newly-adopted stratified random sampling scheme was implemented this year to improve the survey design and help provide baseline observations on seabed types for future development of groundfish habitat maps.
These surveys provide information about distribution, relative abundance, and age structure of important groundfish populations.
Center scientists developed and implemented a new Pacific whiting acoustic survey, which was conducted jointly with Canada to improve timeliness of stock assessments for this species.
In 2003, the survey was restructured to be fully cooperative and included a contingent of both U.S. and Canadian scientists along each leg of the cruise.
This new biennial sampling regime will provide better tracking of the Pacific whiting population.
The NWFSC initiated a hook-and-line survey, in cooperation with sportfishing and commercial industry vessels, for bocaccio and other shelf rockfish in the Southern California Bight.
This survey will improve the information base for groundfish species that are often not adequately sampled during the annual trawl survey and to augment knowledge and expertise of fisheries in this historically under-sampled region.
The Center coordinates the West Coast Observer Program.
In 2002, the Center added approximately 20 observers to its Observer Program in California, Washington, and Oregon ports, bringing the total number of observers to about 40 coastwide.
The Observer Program released, in 2003, the summary and analysis of the first year's observations of the trawl fleet.
The data are the most up-to-date and accurate groundfish catch information on the west coast.
The Center also organized and hosted a workshop to explore options to enable the agency to more effectively deploy observers on small boats.
Center scientists chaired a Biological Review Team to review the status of the Southern Resident killer whale population.
The team evaluated whether these whales were a distinct population of the global killer whale species, why the whale population has been declining, and estimated the risk of extinction of this stock.
The Center co-hosted with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife two killer whalerelated workshops, one on vessel interaction and the other on prey, with participation from local, regional, national, and international experts to identify the most important research questions to improve our understanding of the low survival and reproductive success of Southern Resident killer whales.
The NWFSC created a Southern Resident killer whale research plan and is implementing research projects with local, regional, national, and international experts to address possible causes for Southern Resident killer whale decline and to gain a better understanding of their physiology, ecology, and behavior.
65
Northwest and Southwest Fisheries Science Center scientists updated the status reviews of all currently listed salmon and steelhead evolutionarily significant units (ESUs), as well as one candidate species population, to consider new data that had accumulated since the mid-1990s and to address issues raised in recent court cases regarding the consideration of hatchery and resident fish populations in listing determinations.
Center scientists continued to chair three salmon Technical Recovery Teams (TRTs): Puget Sound, Lower Columbia River and Willamette River, and Interior Columbia River Basin, and co-chaired the Oregon and Northern California Coast TRT.
TRTs are describing the biological conditions that are necessary for recovery of listed populations and are providing technical support to policy makers to help evaluate alternative strategies for meeting recovery goals.
The Center developed the original TRT concept, purpose, and goals.
The NWFSC developed a Cumulative Risk Initiative (CRI) to assess salmonid population trends and the impact of various actions across the entire salmonid life cycle.
This framework has enabled scientists to evaluate how actions in different portions of the salmon life cycle may improve survival, reduce risks, and foster recovery.
The Center conducted critical surveys to assess juvenile salmon abundance, distribution, growth, and health in estuarine environments and to determine how changes in ocean conditions affect juvenile salmon.
The NWFSC conducted studies to investigate prespawn mortality in adult coho salmon from urban streams and co-hosted, with Seattle Public Utility District, a public meeting to discuss preliminary results and develop a more comprehensive and collaborative research effort.
In 2002, the NWFSC spearheaded a multi-million dollar research project to study the ecology and oceanography of Pseudo-nitschia, the algae that produce the neurotoxin domoic acid.
The first two of six cruises were conducted in summer 2003 to measure the physical, chemical, and physiological conditions under which the algae produce the toxin domoic acid and when the toxin is released into the environment.
Center scientists continued critical studies to evaluate the potential delayed effects of juvenile salmon passage through the Columbia River Hydropower System.
They found that the salmon smolts' passage history through the Columbia River was related to differences in their survival and immune system function.
NWFSC scientists conducted a large study using radiotelemetry and PIT-tag technology to evaluate total project survival, route-specific survival, and fish passage behavior at Ice Harbor Dam for yearling and subyearling chinook salmon.
The Center established a new initiative on the science for ecosystem-based management to provide scientific advice on the ecological processes necessary to sustain ecosystem composition, structure, and function in the environments in which fish and fisheries exist.
66
Newport scientists co-led an expedition to study and compare Astoria Canyon, a submarine canyon off the mouth of the Columbia River, with Heceta Bank, a historical groundfishing location and submarine plateau off Oregon's coast.
Scientists mapped, explored, and documented the physical, chemical, and biological systems of the Canyon.
Center scientists continued research designed to estimate the relative reproductive success of naturally spawning hatchery salmon.
Center scientists developed a method to differentiate strains of Vibrio vulnificus with high potential to cause infection in humans from those that are less virulent.
Center scientists continued to work on combining biological and economic data in assessing the cost-effectiveness of screening irrigation diversions in the Salmon River basin.
The NWFSC developed a framework for analyzing the economic impacts of critical habitat designation for salmon and steelhead under the ESA, and contracted with an outside party to conduct a prospective study of these impacts.
Work was also done on identifying potential economic benefits of the critical habitat designations.
Center scientists initiated a study of conservation banking, a means of reducing the costs of mitigation when economic development adversely affects the habitat of an endangered species.
The NWFSC created a stronger link for cooperative research through a Memorandum of Understanding with Washington State University to advance salmon recovery efforts in the interior Columbia.

Conservation Engineering Research
Recent Accomplishments: Since 2001, the Center has developed, implemented and refined a model for projecting bycatch of west coast groundfish species that have been declared overfished.
The model produces total bycatch tonnage estimates that are crucial for evaluating whether proposed management of target species is consistent with efforts to rebuild overfished stocks.
Beginning in 2003, bycatch and discard rates used in the model were derived from data gathered by the NWFSC's West Coast Observer Program.
Using Center-developed captive broodstock technology, the NWFSC continued cooperative activities to spawn sockeye salmon captive broodstock for use in stock restoration activities.
This effort returned more than 300 sea run adults to the Stanley Basin Lakes over the last four years (1999-2002).
This is a 19-fold increase over the number of fish returning to the Lakes during the prior eight years (1991-1998).
The Center is providing critical information regarding salmon migration behavior, passage, and survival, using PIT-tag technology.
The PIT-tag is a small device, about the size of a grain of rice, with a computer-chip that has been used for many years to detect juvenile salmon as they
71
move downstream.
Prototype systems to detect adults returning to spawn have now been installed and evaluated at several Columbia River dams.
Center scientists continued to develop and use acoustic (sonar-based) technologies that use highfrequency sound pulses to measure groundfish abundance and map their distribution.
These technologies are enabling scientists to study groundfish in many more areas of the ocean.
Center scientists began testing, at production scale, in cooperation with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, natural rearing enhancement raceways (NATURES)Â­hatchery raceways enriched with cover, structure, and substrate to provide salmon with a more "wild-like" environment.
These tests will help determine NATURE's effects on salmon survival once the salmon are released from hatcheries.
NWFSC scientists began research on early life history of west coast groundfish species.
The Center is developed breeding and rearing technologies for several key groundfish species.
Center scientists developed new culture techniques to successfully rear yelloweye rockfish through its sensitive larval phase.
This is the first time that this species has been reared in captivity beyond 30 days.
Yelloweye rockfish stocks are severely depleted with rebuilding plans that are estimated to take from 40-170 years using current management approaches.
The successful culture of yelloweye rockfish larvae is the first step needed to determine if stock enhancement strategies can assist in the rebuilding process.
Center scientists worked with partners to develop a new trawl design that is more effective at catching flatfish.
Research Priorities, FY 2004-2009: Â· Conduct fishing gear performance and fish behavioral studies to reduce bycatch and bycatch mortality of prohibited, undersized, or unmarketable species, and to understand performance of survey gear.
Â· Develop conservation hatchery technology to aid recovery of ESA-listed stocks of Pacific salmon.

Recent Accomplishments and Research Priorities for FY 2004-2009 I. Research to Support Fishery Conservation and Management
Recent Accomplishments: Studies on the basic biology, movement, and population status of North Pacific Highly Migratory Species and sharks (HMS) were completed and incorporated into the PFMC HMS Fishery Management Plan, the most recent FMP for the management of HMS resources in the North Pacific.
This work has involved collaboration with fisheries scientists from around the Pacific, including scientists from state, university, and resource user groups.
A multi-national synoptic survey of krill biomass of Antarctic Statistical Subarea 48 (Peninsula, S. Orkney, S. Georgia, and S. Sandwich) was completed.
As a result of a five-year planning effort, one ship from the U.S., Trawl-caught California market squid United Kingdom, Japan, and Russia each conducted a one-month acoustic/oceanographic survey of the above areas and the open-ocean areas between each island group.
This was a CCAMLR-sponsored survey with the participation of scientists from the International Whaling Commission.
The U.S. convened a CCAMLR workshop to complete analyses of survey data.
The Groundfish Program provided PFMC with stock assessments for bocaccio rockfish, cowcod rockfish, widow rockfish, canary rockfish (south), and lingcod (south), as well as rebuilding analyses for bocaccio and cowcod rockfish and Pacific ocean perch.
SWFSC staff initiated and convened a review of harvest rates for west coast groundfish, resulting in significant revision of PFMC management policy.
Midwater trawl surveys provided annual indexes of rockfish recruitment strength for use in stock assessments and analyses of environmental influences.
A recent analysis of atmospheric observations in the North Pacific revealed extensive decadalscale variations in the mid-latitude winter surface wind stress.
In the decade after the winter of 1976, eastward wind stress doubled over a broad area in the central North Pacific and the core of the North Pacific Current was displaced about 360 nautical miles southward.
The result was that surface water entering the California Current was of more subtropical origin in the post-1976 decade.
All factors considered contributed to a multi-decadal temperature pattern of warm, nutrient-poor surface waters in the California and Alaska current regions.
In association with the 1976 climatic shift, marine fishery production in the Oyashio, California, and Alaska currents
79
altered dramatically, suggesting that natural environmental variation significantly alters the longterm yields from many North Pacific fisheries.

Reliable information, critical to the development of regional Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) and subsequent amendments, and, ultimately, to the building and maintenance of sustainable fisheries, is produced through the Northeast Regional SAW process.
This process is a cooperative effort of the NMFS/NEFSC and Northeast Regional Office (NERO), NEFMC, MAFMC, and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC).
In the northeast, peer review of stock assessments is conducted twice per year within the Northeast Regional SAW process.
The SAW process is guided by the SAW Steering Committee (directors of NEFSC and NERO, MAFMC, NEFMC, and the ASMFC), which determines the species to assess during a particular SAW cycle and establishes the assessment terms of reference.
Each SAW cycle begins and ends with the meeting of the SAW Steering Committee and includes Working Group meetings (where analyses are prepared for review); a five-day Stock Assessment Review Committee (SARC) meeting (where analyses are peer-reviewed and advice for managers is developed); and a two- to three-session Public Review Workshop held during planned meetings of the MAFMC, NEFMC, and ASMFC.
Participants in this process include NMFS scientists and managers; representatives from fishery agencies outside the region; MAFMC, NEFMC, and ASMFC representatives; state fishery agency representatives from within the region; academic and NGO participants; industry members; and occasionally experts from the international community.
SAW meetings are open to the public and are widely announced.
NEFSC personnel also participate in various committee meetings of the Regional FMCs and the ASMFC.
Much of the recent gear research in the northeast has been accomplished through grants, with NERO oversight.
These grants have gone to fishers, or to organizations such as states and universities, which carry out the research with the help and cooperation of the fishing industry.
The NERO Fisheries Engineering Group is also involved with data analysis for exempted fishery permits and fishway engineering for anadromous fish.
Conservation engineering activities in the NERO have recently been concentrated on the problem of entanglement of large whales in fixed fishing gear (e.g., lobster traps and gillnet gear).
A resolution to this problem will allow fishing to continue.
The fishing industry aided this effort through its participation in the Gear Advisory Group to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team to devise solutions, and by volunteering vessels and time for observations and testing.
Also, NERO and the Center are collaborating on experiments using pingers and acoustic reflective nets as deterrents to marine mammal entrapment in gillnets.
Cooperative research between the fishing industry, NEFSC/ NER, and academia extends beyond gear research to include, the evaluation of the efficiency of the Center's surf clam/ocean quahog hydraulic dredge; supplemental surveys to the NEFSC bottom trawl surveys; collection of socioeconomic information on commercial/ recreational fishing operations; and gathering data on fish migration (tagging) and bycatch using commercial/ recreational vessels.
Dr. Michael Sissenwine gave a presentation to the House Committee on Resources on cooperative research in the Northeast as a national model.

Conservation Engineering Research
I.E. Â· Â· Â· II.
Recent Accomplishments: Through the recently established NEFSC Office of Cooperative Programs Coordination, approximately 1,600 research fishing days were conducted since the program's inception in September 2000.
This multi-faceted program is designed to explore ways to improve data upon which fishery management decisions are made as well as to improve communications between fishers, scientists, and fisheries managers.
One of the key elements of this program is in the area of conservation research (i.e., mesh selectivity, bycatch discard reduction, harvest efficiency, and gear development).
The NEFSC Fishery Observer Program has made recent strides in the development and deployment of more selective fishing gears by placing scientific observers aboard commercial vessels.
Specifically, in the Gulf of Maine northern shrimp fishery, the Nordmore grate was tested and subsequently implemented as a method to reduce the take of juvenile groundfish.
Sea sampling was used in the initial gear trials, and the at-sea observer program continues to monitor the fishery following full implementation of the grate requirement.
The fishery observer data indicate significant reductions in finfish bycatch after introduction of the Nordmore grate in the shrimp fishery.
Although reduced catches of important groundfishes are in part due to their decreased abundance in recent years, the grate has been effective in reducing the fraction of finfish caught in this fishery, thereby reducing fishing mortality on young groundfish.
Similar studies evaluating the effectiveness of acoustic alarms to deter harbor porpoise from entering groundfish sink gillnets have also been conducted through the Fishery Observer Program.
These studies involved alarm-equipped and control nets, fished in the vicinity of harbor porpoise aggregations.
Results from this work are currently being evaluated to determine
101
the efficacy of this method in reducing harbor porpoise mortalities.
Additionally, at-sea observers have been used in other gear-related studies such as in the New England groundfish fishery to evaluate the effectiveness of changes in trawl mesh size.
Center scientists are also involved with the development of gear based solutions for the reduction of sea turtle takes in commercial fisheries.
Two projects are currently underway, including the use of a chain mat on scallop dredges to reduce turtle bycatch in the scallop fishery and the development of a turtle-proof whelk pot to reduce entanglements.
Both of these projects are cooperative efforts with industry and the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences.
A third cooperative project to develop turtle-safe pound net leaders is in the development stage.
Research Priorities, FY 2004-2009: Â· Â· Â· III.
Conduct research to develop and enhance gear performance and characteristics.
Conduct research aimed at reducing bycatch and marine mammal mortalities.
Conduct studies to evaluate the effects of gears on habitats.
Research on the Fisheries
Recent Accomplishments: The NEFSC has recently completed development of a New England-wide Input-Output model in collaboration with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's Marine Policy Center.
This model is used to assess distributional impacts of fisheries regulations.
The NEFSC conducted collateral research with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Marine Social Sciences (CMSS) to collect socio-economic data on fishers and fisheries-dependent communities.
The NEFSC has conducted Vessel Cost and Earning Surveys for all major fisheries in the region.
These "snap-shot" surveys contributed to the design of the coast-wide pilot program for social science data used by the Atlantic Coast Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP).
Data collection is now being collected on a continuing basis through the sea sampling program.
The NEFSC has produced a variety of socio-economic publications on the fisheries to inform resource managers and the public.
These works address such issues as property rights, allocations between recreational and commercial fisheries, rent-seeking behavior in fisheries, models of recreational fisheries, tests of fishermen's predictions of management impacts and estimates of forgone national benefits as a result of shortcomings in the management of groundfish.
Additionally, in support of two regional FMCs, the NEFSC has provided RIR/FRA analyses for 17 FMPs and numerous amendments/framework actions.
The NEFSC's Office of Marine Ecosystem Studies has been active in the monitoring and assessment of changes within the U.S. Northeast Shelf ecosystem in relation to the recovery of
102
depleted demersal fish stocks, including cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder and the unprecedented population explosion of pelagic herring and mackerel stocks.
Several United Nations agencies are collaborating with the NMFS Office of Science and Technology and Fishery Centers to introduce ecosystem-based assessment and management practices leading to the recovery of depleted fish stocks in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
A five module strategic approach developed and tested by the NEFSC has been introduced to coastal countries bordering LMEs of the Yellow Sea (China and Korea), the Benguela Current (Angola, Namibia, South Africa), the Guinea Current (Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Togo), and Baltic Sea (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia).
The five modules provide advanced methodologies for monitoring and assessing the: (1) productivity, (2) fish and fisheries, (3) pollution and health, (4) socio-economics, and (5) governance of the LMEs.
The NEFSC has conducted several studies on the effects of buyout programs in the Northeast regions including an assessment of buyout program effectiveness and improvements in buyout program design.
The NEFSC has provided personnel who organized a national Communities Workshop attended by NMFS, other federal agency and academic social scientists to explore issues related to National Standard 8 of the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act as well as other legally required social analyses such as Social Impact Assessments.
A Sociocultural Practitioners' Manual resulting from this Workshop, co-authored by NEFSC personnel, is in the editing phases.
The NEFSC has provided personnel to create and update content for the Community Impact Analysis page hosted by HQ's Office of Science and Technology.
(http://www.st.nmfs.gov/st1/econ/impact.html).
The NEFSC created and analyzed a survey of vessel owners and crew who participated in a buyout, creating a publication that is easily accessible to the public by mail or on the web (http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/read/socialsci/survey-initiative/).
The NEFSC has developed methods for estimating fishing capacity and fishing vessel efficiency which have been used to assess fishing capacity in the Northeast region and were accepted as the standard for capacity measurement in other regions.
The NEFSC has developed math programming models to evaluate effort redirection in time and space in response regulatory measures that may vary by region or season.
This model was used the primary basis for biological and economic impact assessment for groundfish and has been applied to evaluate essential fish habitat alternatives for several Mid-Atlantic plan amendments.
Grants from the Global Environment Facility have been allocated over the past five years to support the LME projects.
In each of the LME projects, joint international surveys are carried out measuring the effects of changing ecosystem states on the recovery of depleted fish stocks and the long term sustainability of biomass yields, ecosystem health, and socio-economic benefits to the coastal communities.
Participating countries have created, under the United
103

PACIFIC ISLANDS FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER (PIFSC) The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) conducts multi-disciplinary basic and applied research on insular and oceanic pelagic living resources and fisheries of the Pacific Islands and central Pacific.
The PIFSC headquarters are located in Honolulu, Hawaii, on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus and has a shoreside research facility at Kewalo Basin.
These facilities house the staff of over 160 that are employed by the PIFSC and its University partner, the NOAA Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR).
The primary platforms supporting PIFSC field activities include the NOAA ship Oscar Elton Sette and chartered vessels from the commercial industry.
Fisheries research activities at the PIFSC support the scientific, statistical, and economic needs of the Western Pacific Region Fisheries Management Council (WPRFMC) and international commissions for the management and conservation of large highly migratory pelagic species (HMS), including the Commission on the Conservation of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean
108
(MHLC), the Standing Committee on Tuna and Billfish of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SCTB), and the North Pacific Interim Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species (ISC).
Collaborative and cooperative research partners include other Federal and State of Hawaii agencies, academic institutions, foreign research institutions, government agencies of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, and the public sector including the commercial fishing industry, seafood markets, and recreational and environmental interests, including NGOs.
While not outlined here, a broad range of research focused on protected resources not related to fisheries are also conducted at the PIFSC.
The PIFSC conducts biological, ecological, and economic research on the following fishery resources that fall under active fishery management plans: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· large pelagic fishes of the Pacific Ocean (including tunas, billfishes, sharks, and a number of other incidentally caught but commercially important species) crustaceans of the Pacific Islands deep slopes (lobsters and shrimp) bottomfish and seamount groundfish of the central Pacific precious corals of the central Pacific coral reef ecosystems of the central Pacific
In addition, from a marine ecosystem standpoint, all of the PIFSC fisheries programs rely on information about the physical environment in the western and central Pacific Ocean.
To this end, satellite remotely sensed ocean and atmospheric data, ocean circulation models, information from research cruises, and fisheries data are used to advance our understanding of the dynamic physical and biological ecosystems found in the Pacific region.
Organizationally, fisheries research at the PIFSC is generally carried out by four of the Center's research divisions: the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED), the Ecosystems and Oceanography Division (EOD), the Fish Biology and Stock Assessment Division (FBSAD), and the Fishery Management and Performance Division (FMPD).
The CRED conducts multidisciplinary ecosystem-based research and monitoring that provides the scientific basis for effective management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems in the U.S.-affiliated islands of the central and western Pacific Ocean.
Specific research activities include: 1) ecological assessment and monitoring to quantify and document spatial and temporal changes in the health of coral reef living resources due to natural or human-induced impacts; 2) habitat mapping and characterization to define and understand the dynamics of habitat-ecosystem-resource linkages; 3) monitoring of oceanographic processes affecting reefs to monitor conditions that influence coral reef ecosystem health; and 4) reef restoration through the assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of the effects of marine debris on coral reef ecosystems.
Complementary applied research include: evaluating the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs), evaluating impacts of fishing gear on essential fish habitat, and improving assessment and monitoring techniques for commercial bottomfish populations.
The EOD conducts research aimed to advance our understanding of the structure and dynamics of marine ecosystems in the Pacific Islands region and the broader North Pacific.
Research focuses on: 1) the role of living resources in the ecosystem and 2) how these resources might respond to change, both on the local scale (e.g., predators or prey availability) and on broader
109
time and space scales (e.g., ocean climate change).
The EOD's multidisciplinary projects allow for collaborative research with other Center Divisions, agencies, and academia, and address ecosystem, environment, and anthropogenic impacts for a range of species including the Hawaiian monk seal, several species of sea turtles, and highly migratory species including tunas, billfishes, and other incidentally harvested species.
The FBSAD conducts state-of-the art research related to the population biology, stock assessment, ecology, and life history of exploited resources and associated species (e.g., prey, bycatch, and protected species) in the central and western Pacific.
FBSAD integrates biological, ecological, oceanographic, and economic data to advance stock assessments and to advise resource management at both species and ecosystem levels while addressing mandates of the MSFCMA, ESA, MMPA, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Research programs emphasize population modeling, resource survey cruises, experimental fishing, determination of vital rates and other life-history parameters, environmental physiology, distributional ecology, and mitigating fishery interactions with protected species.
The FMPD is the focal point for fisheries dependent data collection and economic and operational research for the PIFSC.
This Division collects, quality controls, and processes fishery-dependent information (i.e., logbooks), issues quarterly and annual reports (including longline, bottomfish, and lobster), and conducts socio-economic research on Federally managed fisheries.
Also residing in FMPD is the Western Pacific Fisheries Information Network (WPacFIN) that collects and processes Pacific Islands' agencies data (Territories of Guam and American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and State of Hawaii) and also provides technical support to develop and implement appropriate data collecting, processing, summarizing, analyzing, and report-generating systems for these island agencies.
Recent Accomplishments and Research Priorities for FY 2004-2009 I. Research to Support Fishery Conservation and Management
Recent Accomplishments: Several life history studies involving juvenile swordfish, Xiphias gladius, have been completed.
These studies include an otolith-based age and growth study using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that will help to corroborate estimates of age-1 individuals derived from anal fin ray cross-sections and a calibration experiment among four international Pacific fisheries laboratories for processing and reading of fin-ray cross sections to determine growth rates.
Also completed was a project to assess the ability to detect geographically distinct natal sites of juvenile swordfish in the Pacific using geochemical elemental fingerprinting.
These results are a first step in determining our future ability to determine natal origin of adult swordfish based on analyzing the elemental chemistry of the juvenile portion of the otolith.
The PIFSC and the SWFSC have successfully collaborated on a billfish egg and larvae project which has culminated in the ability to identify istiophorid larvae and billfish eggs of all six IndoPacific billfish species found in Hawaiian waters.
Using genetics (PCR identification) techniques developed at the SWFSC and refined at sea on PIFSC research cruises, this technique
110
provides for near-real time identifications while at sea and now allows field researchers the ability to adapt subsequent sampling protocols in order to better define the location, spatial extent, and associated habitat of specific billfish species.
Completed fecundity and size-at-maturity studies for spiny and slipper lobsters in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) revealing temporal changes in the reproductive traits of spiny lobster.
Size-specific increases in fecundity and egg size were observed in the most recent estimates as compared to historical estimates and fecundity increases were consistent with decreases in median body size at sexual maturity.
These findings lend credence to the need to periodically reevaluate the reproductive responses of exploited lobster populations.
Supplemental spiny lobster tagging experiments were continued at Necker Island (ca. 14,000 lobsters tagged) to obtain independent estimates of mortality, growth, abundance, and movement, to advance population modeling and resource assessments.
Feasibility experiments to assess the utility of a stationary underwater camera system to qualify and quantify potential impacts of lobster trapping on coral reefs have also been completed.
Studies on the population status of several HMS were completed that provides up-to-date information for the management of the Hawaii-based longline fishery.
Assessments of North Pacific swordfish and blue shark indicate that both populations are sustainable given current fishing pressure; however, a Pacific-wide blue marlin assessment indicates that the population may be close to a fully exploited state.
PIFSC scientists continue research utilizing electronic tags to improve our understanding of the ecological, migratory and post-release survival of longline caught fish.
Pop-up satellite archival tags (PATs) have been deployed on blue sharks, bigeye tuna, swordfish, opah or moonfish, and albacore tuna.
The PAT technology has provided excellent data on fine-scale vertical movements, and geolocation estimates have pioneered the use of a state-space Kalman filter to estimate light-based geolocation errors, horizontal movement parameters, most probable tracks and residence times.
A recent multi-level economic multi-objective programming model (MMPM) has been developed for the Hawaii fisheries and will be used to analyze the economic impacts of time-area closure policies.
Generalized additive models (GAMS) have been developed using detailed catch and set observations gathered from Pacific Islands Regional Office observer program to assess the impact of time-area closure alternatives in the Hawaiian longline fishery.
In particular, the models were used to assess the effectiveness of the time-area closure imposed on the longline fishery and are being used in litigation concerning the impact of the Hawaiian longline fishery on sea turtles.
Recently completed analysis on the migration pathways and foraging habitat of loggerhead and olive ridley sea turtles will help in identifying time, area, and gear restrictions that will reduce incidental catches in the fisheries where sea turtles are caught incidentally, particularly the Hawaiian longline fishery for tuna.
111
Surveys conducted with the National Undersea Research Program (NURP), Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory (HURL) submersibles and ROV have enabled description of essential fish habitat for Hawaiian bottomfish and evaluate the effectiveness of bottomfish RFAs.
These technologies have also supported PIFSC research on the density, size structure, and associated fish assemblages of deepwater coral communities and have led to findings of the ecological importance of deepwater corals as monk seal critical forage habitat.
Baseline ecological surveys of fish, corals, algae, and other invertebrate diversity and abundance have been completed for selected areas of the U.S. Line and Phoenix Islands, American Samoa, and the NWHI, using separate but complementary techniques of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REAs) and towed diver surveys.
These surveys also resulted in the first, and extensive, observations of widespread mass coral bleaching in the NWHI.
An acoustic benthic habitat characterization system capable of performing high-resolution mapping in coral reef habitats was developed, providing a very effective means for extending habitat characterization to deeper areas that are not suited to observations by divers or by satellite.
More than 100 tons of marine debris was removed (in summer 2003 alone) by a multi-ship, multi-agency 4-month cooperative effort at Pearl and Hermes Atoll and Midway Island in the NWHI.

II.
Recent Accomplishments: A total of 194 experimental longline sets were conducted under a Scientific Research Permit (#1303) in the Pacific during March-July 2002 to explore measures to reduce longline fishery bycatch and mortality of sea turtles.
Deep daytime fishing trials with stealth (camouflaged) fishing gear targeting swordfish were conducted to evaluate the economic viability of the modifications to typical swordfish fishing methods.
Deployment of electronic hook timers and time depth recorders to document when and where turtle bycatch occurred and tests on the effectiveness of hook size and type (e.g., large circle hooks) on catch were also components of the experiment.
Approximately 90 at-sea observers were trained in attachment of pop-off satellite archival tags (PATs) in order to determine the impact of sea turtle longline interactions, such as survivorship and movement patterns of sea turtles post-release.

Research on the fisheries
Recent Accomplishments: The required social impact analysis (SIA) for the WPRFMC 's proposed 50 mile area closure around Guam for bottomfish vessels greater than 50 feet in length was completed to fulfill the requirements for the WPRFMC 's FMP amendment which would limit the bottomfishing activities of large vessels in the nearshore areas of Guam.
Recent analysis on the quantitative measurement of fishing capacity in the Western Pacific Region was presented to the 83rd SSC.
The study covered capacity analysis for four major fisheries under the management of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council 1) Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) lobster fishery, 2) NWHI bottomfish fishery, 3) Hawaii Pelagic longline fishery, and 4) American Samoa Pelagic longline fishery.
Preliminary results indicate that excess capacity existed in some fisheries, especially in NWHI lobster fishery and NWHI bottomfish fishery.
However, the study also suggested that additional analysis was needed; excess capacity can result from other factors such as changes in regulations, reduced stock abundance, or fluctuation of oceanic environment.
A GAM analysis on the catches of Pacific blue marlin has been completed.
The correction of a large array of logbook data from the Hawaii-based longline fishery to generate a "research quality" database will now permit additional analyses such as computing standardized CPUE series for blue marlin from March 1994 - June 2002 and comparing it to the official fishery statistics.
The analysis shows that even with the well-organized procedures in place, relatively sophisticated analyses may still be necessary to improve data quality, even under virtually ideal circumstances for monitoring.
Interviews with more than 80 captains, owners, or crew of Hawaii-based longline vessels have been completed in support of ongoing baseline sociological studies.
Interviews were unique, with a different set of questions depending on the interviewee's interests, concerns, knowledge, and role in the industry and provided information describing the background of longline participants, including how they came to be involved in the fishery, and their perceptions of the fishing lifestyle, fisheries management and its impacts, and the longline fishing community and industry.
