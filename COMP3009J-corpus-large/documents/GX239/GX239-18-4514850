Seal of the Commonwealth Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project Oversight Coordination Commission _________________________________________________________________ About the Commission The Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project Oversight Coordination Commission ("the Commission") is made up of the Attorney General, the State Auditor, and the Inspector General.
It was established by the Legislature to facilitate the activities of those offices with respect to the multi-billion dollar Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project ("the CA/T Project").
Each of the three state officers has ongoing responsibilities regarding the CA/T Project.
The Attorney General investigates and prosecutes criminal cases and affirmative civil actions, defends the CA/T Project in litigation brought on by third parties, and advises the CA/T Project management on anti-fraud measures.
The State Auditor reviews the CA/T Project's system of internal controls, and identifies areas of waste and questionable expenses.
The Inspector General monitors the design and construction of CA/T Project for fraud, waste, and abuse, and focuses on opportunities for improvement.
The unprecedented cost, scope, and complexity of the CA/T Project made it necessary to dedicate additional resources to enforcement and oversight activities, and brought about the creation of the Commission.
In 1995, the Legislature enacted Chapter 102 of the Acts of 1995 (the Metropolitan Highway Bill), which directed the State Auditor, the Inspector General, and the House and Senate Committees on Post Audit and Oversight to jointly prepare a comprehensive plan for oversight on the CA/T Project.
The Attorney General also was included in the planning process because of his crucial role in investigating and prosecuting civil and criminal matters.
The Legislature then enacted Section 2B of Chapter 205 of the Acts of 1996, and funds for the operation of the Commission and for the enhanced activities of the three member offices became available in January 1997.
Since then, the Commission has served as a forum for communicating ideas, sharing information, and coordinating the efforts of the three offices on the CA/T Project.
The Commission meets monthly on a staff level and quarterly with representatives from legislative offices.
