Gifted and talented students have high levels of achievement, intellectual and academic ability, creativity, leadership skills and talent in the visual and performing arts.
Districts are required to have a systematic process for identifying gifted and talented students.
The TEA issues guidelines for the identification of gifted and talented students in an effort to ensure that all of these students receive a quality education.
The process must include quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation tools and instruments.
Funding for the identification of gifted and talented students and programs is available through the Texas Foundation School Program.
Gifted and talented programs provide more challenging curriculum for students from various cultural, linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds.
CHISD's Gifted Education program is a three-pronged program focusing on creative, intellectual and leadership skills and serves students who are performing, or have the potential to perform, at high levels relative to their peers.
The program is designed to develop complex thinking processes that include problem solving and decision making, as well as critical and creative thinking.
Students are provided the opportunity to work independently or in groups.
Compared to its peer districts, CHISD spends the most in total and per student on its gifted and talented education program.
The number of CHISD students enrolled in gifted and talented program as a percentage of total enrollment is less than two of its peer districts (Exhibit 2-35).

De Soto 468 6.6%
Region 10 66,067 10.7% State 339,270 8.2% Source: TEA, PEIMS, 2001-02.
The number of students served in CHISD's program does not include students in kindergarten through grade 2.
CHISD received a waiver to delay gifted and talented identification until the second semester of grade 2.
In kindergarten through grade 2, teachers informally evaluate the potential of all children.
Teachers gather student data in a portfolio each year to assist them in determining if a formal referral for evaluation should be made in May of a student's second-grade year.
Total funding for the gifted and talented programs increased by 16.9 percent and per student funding decreased by 10.8 percent from 1997-98 through 2001-02.
The number of students in the program increased 31.1 percent over the same period (Exhibit 2-36).

*On April 30, 2002, the district reported to the review team an amended budget of $1,717,942; however, the budget reported to TEA for PEIMS was $145,115.
Each CHISD school serving grades K-6 students determines the gifted and talented grouping design at grades 3 through 6.
Once a grade groups gifted and talented students in a classroom, the grouping practice will be maintained for the remaining elementary grades.
Gifted and talented students receive different instruction from other students.
FINDING
CHISD provides an abundance of honors, Pre-Advanced Placement (Pre-AP) and Advanced Placement (AP) courses for its students and encourages students to follow the more rigorous graduation program.
Honors courses provide students with a more challenging curriculum than regular education courses.
AP courses give students the opportunity to try college-level courses while in high school.
If students score a three or better on an AP exam, colleges award three or four college hour credits when they enroll in the college.
Pre-AP courses prepare students academically for AP.
The College Board provides curriculum objectives for the courses and offer teacher training institutes.
Cedar Hill Middle School gifted and talented students enroll in Pre-AP and honors courses.
AP and Pre-AP courses at the high school level provide students with more academically rigorous or differentiated instruction.
CHISD received recognition in a Dallas area magazine, D and in Newsweek for the number of students enrolled in Advanced Placement courses.
Newsweek ranks schools according to the number of Advanced Placement exams given in one year divided by the number of graduating seniors that year.
In March 2000, Newsweek ranked Cedar Hill High School in the top 450 schools in the nation.
CHISD provides honors, advanced or pre-AP courses in the four core subjects and band at the middle school.
Students in the middle school may also take Spanish I for high school credit.
High school students may choose from an array of Pre-AP and AP classes in the four core areas and 35 electives (Exhibit 2-37).

To receive a high school diploma, a student entering grade 9 in 1998-99 through 2000-01 could complete the requirements of the minimum high school program, the recommended high school program or the distinguished achievement program as specified in Chapter 74.11 of the Texas Education Code.
Additional core course credits of one fine arts credit and two credits in the same foreign language are required for the recommended program and three foreign language credits in the same language are required for the distinguished achievement program.
The distinguished achievement program requires four advanced measures obtained by a combination of scores of three or better on College Board Advanced Placement exams, college courses and original research projects.
CHISD does not require prerequisites to enroll in honors, Pre-AP and AP courses.
Enrollment is open to any student.
Consequently, many more students enroll in the more challenging courses.
Gifted and talented students who enroll in classes with general education students receive more challenging assignments.
The percentage of CHISD students enrolled in advanced courses and graduating under the recommended graduation plan greatly exceeds that of all of its peer districts and the state and regional averages (Exhibit 2-38).

COMMENDATION
CHISD provides many advanced courses and encourages students to pursue the more challenging recommended graduation program.
FINDING
CHISD's practice of open enrollment in honors, pre-AP and AP courses is not the same as printed descriptions of course requirements in the high school student handbook and catalog.
The Cedar Hill High School Student Handbook and the high school curriculum catalog of course offerings list prerequisites for enrollment in honors, Pre-AP and AP courses.
The criteria for Pre-AP/AP/Honors described in the Student Handbook lists the following requirements: 1.
grades: an 87 or above average and/or demonstrated mastery of subject matter and appropriate grade level; 2.
testing: achievement test scores above the 88th percentile and mastery of TAAS; 3.
teacher recommendation based on student motivation and cooperation is required; 4.
advanced science courses require demonstrated proficiency in math; and 5.
English honors require an analysis of the student writing.
The high school curriculum catalog of course offerings indicates that test scores and teacher recommendations are prerequisitesfor enrollment.
The high school principal and counselors and the assistant superintendent for Administrative Services said enrollment in an honors or AP course is open to any student.
Confusion occurs when the regulations for enrollment in certain courses are stated differently from the practice the school follows.
Some students may not be aware of the practice and therefore do not enroll in the class.
Recommendation 14:
Align the high school student handbook and the curriculum catalog of high school course offerings with actual practice.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The associate superintendent, Instruction and Administrative Services, and the high school principal review the current practice and the description of the prerequisites in thehigh school student handbook and the curriculum catalog.
October 2002 2.
The associate superintendent, Instruction and Administrative Services, submits the corrections to the high school student handbook and the curriculum catalog of course offerings to the superintendent for approval.
November 2002 3.
The high school principal corrects the high school student handbook and the curriculum catalog prior to printing.
December 2002 4.
The high school principal disseminates newly printed curriculum catalogs to students prior to selection of courses.
February 2003
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
CHISD does not have a plan for tracking and monitoring AP test fees, incentive awards and teacher training.
The district funds advanced placement test fees that are in addition to the state's $30 stipend, which detracts from funds available for students not performing up to expectations.
In 2000-01, the district spent $17,430 to cover the additional $30 AP fee, making the student responsible for only $18 per test.
The number of students ranged from 190 students in 1998-99 taking 353 tests to 289 students in 2000-01 taking 581 tests.
In 1999, the state began funding an exam subsidy of $30 for each test fee for students enrolled in an AP class at a Texas public school.
Hence, students pay $48 instead of $78 for each AP exam taken.
In addition, students who are eligible for financial need reductions qualify for another $22 fee reduction offered by the College Board, the examination sponsor, and a $7 administrative fee waiver.
TEA also uses federal grant funds to waive another $14 reducing the total amount for an AP examination per economically disadvantaged student to $5.
The district also participates in the Texas Advanced Placement Incentive program passed by the Texas Legislature in 1993 designed to award campuses, teachers and students for high performance on AP exams.
The state incentive program gives $100 awards to each campus for each student who scores a three or above on an AP examination.
The TEC specifically states these are "school awards" and "a school shall give priority to academic enhancement purposes in using an award received under the program."
In a TEA memo dated February 2002 from the associate commissioner of Curriculum, Assessment and Technology, school districts were informed that AP Campus Awards may not be used for: * student bonuses, awards, scholarships or any payment that could be considered financial gain for the student; * teacher bonuses, awards, scholarships, or any payment that could be considered financial gain for the teacher; * administrator bonuses, scholarships, or any payment that could be considered financial gain for the administrator; * payment of any portion of student examinations, including re-test fees * t-shirts or any other such novelty items; and * all other items or payments that could be considered inappropriate.
CHISD received $10,700 and $10,000 in 1999-2000 and 2000-01, respectively for campus awards.
TEA sends campus principals a survey that captures information on how the campus awards are being used to improve academic services.
The district was unable to provide a copy of the completed TEA survey for 1999-2000 or 2000-01 upon request.
In 1991-92, the O'Donnell Foundation granted CHISD $41,000 for technology and the AP program.
The grant funded an incentive program that provided monetary awards to students scoring three or better on an AP exam and monetary awards to teachers based upon the number of their students scoring three or better.
CHISD, through a local decision, pays students and teachers stipends of $100 per score of three or four and $200 per score of five on AP exams.
In 2000-01, the district paid $38,815 in student/teacher stipends for AP scores and teacher training.
In addition to these stipends, CHISD also pays the registration and travel expenses and a$300stipend for teachers attending AP summer institutes.
The state reimburses the district for these fees up to $450 for expenses incurred for the training of a certified AP teacher who teaches an AP class the following year.
Beginning in summer 2002, the grants include teachers in grades 9 and 10 who teach Pre-AP courses.
Six of 12 CHISD teachers attending AP summer institutes in 2000 qualified for reimbursements and eight of 23 qualified in summer 2001.
The district, however, funded all 35 teachers for training received in both years while only receiving TEA reimbursements for the 14 teachers who were certified.
The total cost to the district was $10,733.
CHISD does not require teachers attending summer training be certified.
Exhibit 2-39 shows the amount of stipends and subsidies awarded over the past five years.

Source: CHISD, associate superintendent, Business and Support Services, July 2002.
Many districts who participate in the Advanced Placement Texas Incentive Program have instituted a plan to determine how they will fund their certified teachers, who will assist in the administrative record keeping for the program and how the campuses receiving award incentives will invest their award money for academic enhancements.
A plan for districts' AP programs, their funds and incentive awards gives districts not only direction but ample time to determine if their general fund can support expenses like additional exam subsidies.
Recommendation 15:
Implement the Texas Incentive Program for Advanced Placement and track subsidies, awards and teacher training.
The district should consider eliminating unnecessary district subsidies for Advanced Placement (AP) exam fees and AP training for uncertified teachers.
Under the Texas Incentive program for Advanced Placement, students would pay $48 per exam.
Students who qualify due to economic status would pay $5 per exam.
Only certified teachers who attend AP summer institutes should be reimbursed for their fees and travel.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The associate superintendent, Instruction and Administrative Services, creates a plan for tracking subsidies, awards and teacher training and recommends to the superintendent the elimination of unnecessary AP subsidies.
October 2002 2.
The superintendent requests board approval for the elimination of additional district AP subsidies.
December 2002 3.
The board approves of the plan and the elimination of additional district AP subsidies.
January 2003 4.
The associate superintendent, Instruction and Administrative Services, implements the plan.
January 2003 5.
The associate superintendent, Instruction and Administrative Services, informs the high school principal, teachers, counselors, students and parents of the changes.
January 2003
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
