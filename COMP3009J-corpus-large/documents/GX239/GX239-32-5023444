Notice Regarding Contract Forms
* As public records, the contract forms adopted by the Texas Real Estate Commission are available to any person.
* However, TREC contract forms are intended for use only by licensed real estate brokers or salespersons who are trained in their correct use.
Mistakes in the use of a form may result in financial loss or a contract which is unenforceable.
* If you are obtaining the forms for possible use in a real estate transaction, you should contact a real estate licensee or an attorney for assistance.
TREC cannot provide legal advice to the public on private contractual matters.
TREC does not promulgate listing or buyer representation agreements, property management contracts, forms for commercial property, or residential leases (other than temporary residential leases used in connection with a sale).
Contact your attorney or a trade association for such forms.
Revised Contract Forms Available TREC approved a series of 8 revised contract forms January 6, 2003.
Effective April 1, 2003, these forms must be used by licensees in transactions for which they are appropriate unless a principal or principals attorney prepares a different document for the transaction.
Also, two forms were repealed effective April 1, 2003.
The forms may be used by licensees on a voluntary basis prior to the effective date.
