Field Operations Program--Overview of Advanced Technology Transportation, CY 2000 The transportation industry's private sector is adept at understanding and meeting the demands of its customers; the federal government has a role in encouraging the development of products that are in the long-term interest of the greater public good.
It is up to the government to understand issues that affect public health, well-being, and security.
This is reflected in the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Transportation Technologies' (OTT) mission--to promote the development and deployment of transportation technologies that reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, while helping to improve the nation's air quality and promoting U.S. competitiveness.
For OTT's Field Operations Program (FOP), this means providing potential customers with unbiased information on transportation technologies that address these goals.
The FOP is being implemented for DOE by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).
Program managers from DOE, NREL, and INEEL must understand the transportation market well enough to focus their resources where they can have the greatest impact.
Along these lines, program managers leverage program funds by partnering with other governmental and industry groups with similar goals.
In this document, we provide an overview of the transportation market in terms of energy use, vehicle sales, emissions, potential partners for the FOP, advanced technology vehicle availability, and other important factors.
We do not draw conclusions from this information--that will be the function of a FOP strategy session to be held later in FY 2000.
This paper provides the information necessary for the appropriate conclusions to be drawn during those sessions.
The information contained in this paper is based on several sources.
A complete list of sources can be found in the appendix.
Most of the statistics came from the following sources: - The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Annual Energy Review and Alternatives to Traditional Transportation Fuels. - Transportation Energy Data Book, published for DOE by Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Air Pollution Emissions Trends Update 1970-1997.
These publications are usually produced annually.
We used the most recent volumes available.
Transportation Energy Use The transportation sector of the U.S. economy is a major consumer of energy.
Figure 1 shows the total U.S. energy consumption from 1950 to 1999, categorized by transportation, residential, and industrial consumption.
Transportation accounts for approximately 27% of the total energy consumption (94 quadrillion Btu/year) in the United States, including petroleum, coal, electricity, and natural gas (source: EIA's Annual Energy Review).
Considering petroleum alone, transportation accounts for roughly 66% of the total yearly U.S. petroleum consumption (36.6 quadrillion Btu, or about 18.7 million barrels per day [source: Transportation Energy Data Book Â­ 19th Edition, 1999]).

With transportation accounting for such a significant portion of U.S. energy consumption, it is important to understand which segments of transportation activity consume the most energy.
Figure 2 shows that of total energy use for transportation (including highway and non-highway), automobiles and light trucks account for approximately 67%, heavy trucks account for 17%, and buses (including school, intercity, and transit) account for about 1%.
Consumption of petroleum by automobiles and light-duty trucks exceeds that used by all other non-transportation consumers (industrial, residential/commercial buildings, and utilities).
Heavy truck petroleum consumption is greater than that of buildings and utilities.

Automobiles 35.9%
Heav y Tr uc ks 16.7%
Light Tr uc ks 25.4%
The FOP is primarily concerned with on-road or "highway" vehicles.
Highway energy use (automobiles, trucks, and buses) accounts for about 79% of the transportation total.
Figure 3
2
breaks down highway energy use.
Automobiles and light trucks use about 78% of the highway energy use, heavy trucks use about 21%, and buses about 1%.
It seems clear that from an energyuse perspective, highway transportation in general and cars and light trucks specifically provide the greatest potential for reducing petroleum usage.
As an example, a 10% reduction in energy use from cars and light trucks (achieved by introducing an alternative fuel or improving fuel economy) would result in displacing nearly 750,000 barrels of petroleum per day.
A similar percent reduction in petroleum energy use from heavy-duty trucks would displace around 200,000 barrels per day, and for buses petroleum consumption could be reduced by about 10,000 barrels per day.
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) goals call for 30% displacement of imported petroleum by 2010.

Vehicle Stock and Yearly Sales The total number of highway motor vehicles (including automobiles, trucks, and buses) in use in the United States in 1997 was estimated to be between 205 million and 210 million.
Figure 4 shows clearly that automobiles, and light (
Automobiles make up about 60% of the total, light trucks 35%, medium trucks 1%, heavy trucks 1%, and buses approximately 13%.
The other important point to note on Figure 4 is that private individuals own about 90% of the total number of vehicles.
Fleets own approximately 10%.
Figure 5 shows the annual sales for 1997 and 1999 calendar years.
As expected, Figure 5 shows that automobiles and light and medium trucks dominate the annual sales of vehicles.
Automobiles made up approximately 53%, light trucks 44%, medium trucks less than 1%, and heavy trucks about 2% of the total annual vehicle sales in 1997.
The recent rise in the light truck market is shown by the 1999 figures.
Sales of light trucks were up to 46.6% of the market while automobiles dropped to 49.7%.
Sales of heavy-duty trucks (3.6%) were up in 1999, showing record profits.
A market trend that has received considerable attention is the increase in market share of minivans, light trucks, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).
OTT's "Fact of the Week" (http://www.ott.doe.gov/facts) for December 6, 1999, stated: "The truck [light trucks, minivans and SUVs] share of the new light vehicle market has been growing since the early 1980s, with
3
most of the growth attributable to SUVs and minivans.
Collectively, light trucks accounted for 48% of light vehicle sales in model year 1999, with pickup trucks and vans at 22%, SUVs at 19%, and minivans at 8%."
Data from this analysis (shown in Figure 6) dramatically illustrate the trend.
Concern about the environmental implications of this trend has led the California Air Resources Board and EPA to tighten emissions regulations on this class of vehicles.
Also, government and industry are currently considering whether to include SUVs under the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) program or to initiate a similar program for SUVs.
Several automotive manufacturers have recently shown hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) SUVs and minivan concept vehicles.

Energy Use per Passenger Mile Of course, energy use and the number of vehicles are related--the more vehicles, the more energy used--but fuel efficiency and number of passengers per vehicle also play important roles.
Figure 7 indicates how various transportation modes compare in terms of the energy used per vehicle mile traveled and the energy used per passenger mile (data were taken from the Transportation Energy Data Book Â­ 19th Edition, 1999).
Figure 7 indicates that although transit buses use 7 to 8 times more energy per vehicle mile than automobiles, the two modes use comparable amounts of energy per passenger mile.
Intercity buses, on the other hand, use somewhat less per passenger mile.
Based on the available data, the amount of energy used per passenger mile for an automobile is approximately 38% less than the energy used per vehicle.
The energy used per passenger mile for a transit bus is 89% lower than the energy used per vehicle, and for intercity buses the energy used per passenger mile is 96% lower than the energy used per vehicle.
The number of passengers per vehicle in a transit bus varies widely depending on the location of the service.
Emissions As shown in Table 1, the transportation sector accounts for a large share of the national emissions of criteria pollutants.
Highway vehicle emissions are somewhat less, but still make up a significant portion of the overall contribution.

Vehicle and Technology Trends OTT's primary goals are to lower U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports and to reduce emissions of pollutants from vehicles.
Partners within OTT represent important potential because of their relative budgets, familiarity with the technologies, strong industry contacts, and common goals.
Following is a brief outline of some of the immediate focus areas in the Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT) and the Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies (OAAT).
The Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies focuses on improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions from advanced diesel and natural gas engines, and on developing nonpetroleum fueled diesel engines.
The most promising projects designed to meet these goals in the near term are developing clean-diesel technologies, next-generation natural gas engines, and HEVs.
Cleandiesel technologies include advanced petroleum-based fuels, such as low-sulfur diesel and Fischer-Tropsch, and aftertreatment methods, such as exhaust gas recirculation and regenerative particulate traps.
Although Fischer-Tropsch diesel produces lower exhaust emissions than conventional diesel, it is relatively expensive to produce and it is questionable whether it could be supplied in quantities sufficient to replace diesel in the marketplace in the near term.
Because of this, use of Fischer-Tropsch will probably be limited to niche markets.
OHVT goals will more likely be met in the near term with a combination of aftertreatment technology and use of lowsulfur fuel.
OTT has identified the development of next-generation natural gas vehicles as a strategic element in its program to reduce oil imports, vehicle pollutants and greenhouse gases.
Through OHVT, OTT is initiating the effort to develop commercially viable medium- and heavy-duty natural gas vehicles to meet their goals.
The two vehicle platforms identified for this effort are a Class 3-6 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle and a Class 7-8 liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicle.
Heavy-duty HEVs are currently being demonstrated in several locations and show significant potential to meet OHVT goals.
Most of the vehicles in demonstration programs are transit buses that are very close to commercial production.
The Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies focuses on future technology of personal transportation systems.
The goal of this office is to research, develop, and validate technologies that will give automobiles three times their current fuel economy, allow them to meet Tier II emissions goals, and result in performance comparable to that of current vehicles.
OAAT supports PNGV in these goals.
These projects include hybrid vehicles using multiple energy or power sources, alternative fuel vehicles operating on nonpetroleum fuels, and electric vehicles (EVs) powered by advanced batteries or fuel cells.
As with heavy-duty vehicles, near-term technology to meet OTT's goals involves hybrid electric powertrains.
Although it shows great promise for reducing emissions, fuel cell technology will require extensive R
Other areas of OAAT research for OAAT high-power energy storage devices, advanced automotive materials, fuels, and EV batteries.
To meet its goals, OAAT works closely with major automotive manufacturers and other industry partners.
Important players include the three major U.S. auto manufacturers (DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors [GM]), Ballard, Lockheed-Martin, and H Power Corp.

Advanced Technology Vehicles Global concern for the environment has been increasing throughout the last decade, and "green" technologies are being emphasized all over the world.
Many companies are advertising efficient manufacturing processes, recycling efforts, and environmentally friendly products.
With the vehicle industry cited as a major source of pollution, vehicle manufacturers are feeling pressure to produce cleaner cars and trucks.
All the major automotive manufacturers are working on some kind of environmentally friendly vehicle.
HEVs are considered near-term technology; several hybrid vehicles are already in production, and will be available to consumers in 2000.
Because most hybrid technology uses conventional fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, they are closer to market than more advanced technologies.
Integrating these types of vehicles into fleets is easy because the fueling infrastructure is already in place.
In some cases, an electric charging infrastructure may be needed, but many HEVs are "charge sustaining," meaning they do not have to be plugged in.
The more advanced technologies being developed, such as fuel cells, may use fuels that have limited availability.
Integrating these vehicles into society will take a concentrated and combined effort from vehicle manufacturers, fuel providers, and other industry partners.
This section is intended to give a "snapshot" of advanced automotive technologies being introduced into the market in the next 1 to 5 years.
This information will help identify possible projects for partnerships and direct future activities for the FOP.
Several methods were used to achieve this goal.
The NREL Library staff conducted a literature search for information published within the last year on advanced technology vehicles.
Staff in the Center for Transportation Technologies and Systems conducted an extensive Internet search, which included Web sites from automotive manufacturers, bus and truck manufacturers, automotive news, fuel industry, and state and federal governments.
We obtained a database on HDV projects from WestStartCALSTART that contained detailed information on past and ongoing projects all over the world.
Weststart-CALSTART is a nonprofit organization made up of more than 200 companies and organizations that are dedicated to the creation of an advanced transportation technologies industry.
To supplement this information, we interviewed several NREL employees about their work for OHVT and OAAT.
Sources are listed in the appendix.
The following sections discuss the advanced technologies being developed, and give an indication of current trends.
This summary focuses on technology and vehicles that are likely to be available in the U.S. market.
Tables in the appendix give a detailed listing of these vehicles along with vehicles being developed in other parts of the world.
A focus for all manufacturers is in reducing cost of production and individual components, so the end product is affordable to the average consumer.
Definitions of the terms used to describe the development stage of a given vehicle vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.
For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Research Â­ In the early stages of development (drawings or models) Concept Â­ An actual vehicle, usually operational, used by the manufacturer as a display or show vehicle Prototype Â­ A working vehicle, very close to a production model Demonstration Â­ Limited production of the vehicle being tested by the manufacturer in a realworld application Production Â­ Available to the public.

Electric Technology Light-Duty Vehicles Pure EVs have been available for quite some time.
Manufacturers, however, have restricted EV sales to certain areas of the country, and some models are available for lease only.
These areas are mostly where the government has set zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates.
(California laws mandate that 10% of vehicles sales by 2003 be ZEVs.)
Although EVs represent the only currently available technology that yields no tailpipe emissions, the market for these clean vehicles has been small because of range issues and the high cost of battery technology.
Future developments in this area will most likely center on advances in battery technology.
The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) was formed in 1991 to address concerns about battery cost.
USABC is focusing on: (1) lowering the cost of materials and using them more efficiently, (2) designing smaller and lighter batteries, and (3) overcoming issues with volume manufacturing.
Table 2 shows current and near-term battery technologies that are being developed.

Table 3 lists the current light-duty EV models available in the United States.
Many of the current technology EVs have been evaluated by the FOP at INEEL.
The test methods for EVs have been established over the years since they were first introduced into the market.
Future testing of pure EVs should focus on major breakthroughs in associated technologies, such as advanced batteries.

Heavy-Duty Vehicles Battery-powered electric buses have been in use since 1990.
Some of the early demonstration projects on pure electric buses were not always successful, but others have led to usable products that are still in service.
These demonstration and evaluation programs have led to modifications that allowed commercial products to meet the needs of many transit agencies.
Electric buses, however, must be closely matched to an application that will not be adversely affected by the limitations of the current technology.

Hybrid Electric Technology Light-Duty Vehicles Most of the major automotive manufacturers are working on HEV technology.
Most use gasoline for fuel, although Ford and GM have recently introduced diesel hybrid concept vehicles.
Manufacturers are taking varied approaches in design, including parallel and series configurations.
In a series hybrid, the power unit drives an alternator to generate electricity.
This electricity is either stored in the batteries, or sent to the motor that powers the wheels.
The series hybrid vehicle can operate in a zero emission mode until the batteries are drained to a certain level, when the engine will turn on and recharge them.
A parallel hybrid is configured with two power paths: either the power unit or the electric propulsion system, or both, can power the wheels.
More attention is currently focused on parallel hybrids for light-duty applications because they are more flexible in terms of battery, engine, and motor size.
Because the output of engine and motor is combined, a parallel design can give similar performance as a conventional vehicle with smaller, lighter engines and components.
Smaller components, especially batteries, means lower cost and higher fuel economy, but not necessarily lower emissions.
Most light-duty hybrid vehicles at or near production are parallel configuration.
Two hybrid light-duty vehicles (LDVs) already in production will be available in the United States in 2000--the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius.
During the North American International Auto Show in January, Ford and GM introduced their latest hybrid electric concept cars, the Prodigy and Precept.
DaimlerChrysler has introduced the Chrysler Citadel HEV concept car, as well as an HEV version of the Durango SUV.
None of these manufacturers, however, has announced an estimate of when these vehicles might reach the market.
Table 5 lists light-duty HEVs that may be available in the United States in the future.
For more details on these and other HEVs, see the appendix.

Heavy-Duty Vehicles The trend for heavy-duty HEVs has been to take the easiest path to commercialization.
In the HDV market, most hybrids are series designs fueled by diesel.
Hybrid electric buses have been produced in limited quantities since the mid 1990s.
HEV buses are being tested in many U.S. cities.
There are several reasons that HEV technology is easily adapted into bus applications; for example, the size of a bus or trolley allows room for components and batteries, and fixed routes also make optimization of the drive system easier.
Several heavy-duty hybrid trucks are also being tested.
Table 6 summarizes the HDVs being demonstrated in projects around the United States (based on data collected for DOE/OHVT and NREL Heavy Hybrid Electric Vehicle Forum, Washington, DC, June 15, 1999).
Several of these projects stand out as important, and should be mentioned separately.
The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in New York City is the largest transit agency in the United States, operating approximately 4,000 buses.
Because NYC-MTA purchases more buses than any other transit agency, it has a large influence on the direction that technology will take for the industry.
The agency has ordered 10 Orion IV HEV buses that will go into service in early 2000.
NREL's FOP is participating in an evaluation being conducted by DOE/OHVT on these buses, five of which are already in service.
The outcome of this hybrid bus project should have an effect on the future of HEV buses in the country.
Since the project began, NYC-MTA has ordered 125 additional HEV buses from Orion.
12
In partnership with Advanced Vehicle Systems, Inc.
(AVS), the Electric Transit Vehicle Institute in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has been promoting the design and production of electric buses since 1992.
These buses have been placed in real-life applications through Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority as well as other organizations all over the country.
In addition to the electric bus projects, the partnership is testing CNG hybrid buses.
The city of Tempe, Arizona, has 31 AVS CNG HEV buses on order, and Tampa, Florida, has ordered 10 AVS diesel hybrids.
United Parcel Service (UPS) is currently testing a fleet of HEV delivery trucks in three U.S. cities.
The UPS hybrid project is the first medium-duty urban application of HEV technology.
The truck uses a Navistar diesel engine with a Lockheed-Martin HybriDrive control system.
Navistar is a leading manufacturer of heavy- and medium-duty trucks in the country.
The outcome of this project could influence the industry.
Several issues must be addressed in order to begin extensive test and evaluation of the HEV LDVs and HDVs being introduced on the market.
Test methods must be developed and standardized so that comparisons can be made.
Considering the varied levels of hybridization, this could prove challenging.
Each configuration needs to be understood to match it to various types of service.
The recent trend to light-duty diesel hybrids brings up additional issues, such as aftertreatment methods to reduce PM and NOx emissions from diesel fuel.
Fuel Cell Technology Light-Duty Vehicles Although manufacturers are working on HEVs for the near-term market, the most widely accepted solution for the future appears to be fuel cells.
Most automotive manufacturers are currently working on some type of fuel cell vehicle (FCV).
They run the gamut in size from minis to SUVs.
The manufacturers have taken varied approaches to designing an FCV.
Some are working alone on their ideas.
Honda is developing its own fuel cell, and Nissan is designing a reformer.
Partnerships, listed below, have also been formed to combine knowledge and skills to their best advantage.
Â· Â· XCELLSIS Fuel Cell Engines Â­ A joint venture between DaimlerChrysler, Ballard, and Ford to develop, manufacture, and commercialize fuel cell engines for buses, cars, and trucks.
California Fuel Cell Partnership Â­ A collaboration between auto manufacturers, oil companies, a fuel cell company, and state and federal governments.
The goal is to demonstrate FCVs in real-world conditions, demonstrate the viability of infrastructure technology, explore the path to commercialization, and increase public awareness and enhance opinion about fuel cell technology.
New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) Â­ This Japanese partnership is sponsoring a 5-year research project with Nissan, Suzuki, and 11 universities to develop direct methanol FCVs.

Fuel cells are capable of running on a wide range of fuels through reforming.
Methanol, gasoline, and natural gas are being considered for reforming, but only vehicles that operate on hydrogen can be ZEVs.
A challenge in the development of FCVs will be determining the best fuel to result in efficient operation without compromising emissions.
Several FCVs are already on the road.
These are mostly custom-built, hydrogen-fueled proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell buses that are being tested in transit applications.
The first production FCVs will most likely be fueled by hydrogen and placed in fleet applications.
Because this technology is simpler than reformer models, it will be ready for demonstration earlier.
Fleets will be targeted because of the lack of hydrogen fueling infrastructure.
A fleet would be able to invest in a centralized fuel site for fueling its own vehicles.
Fleets are also targeted because of government mandates and incentives.
As reformer technology improves, FCVs powered by other fuels may emerge on the market.
After fleet testing, limited lease programs should be available.
These will likely be high profile individuals in a position to "get the word out" to the public.
Within the next 10 years, there is expected to be limited production of FCVs available for personal purchase.
To put the vehicles on the road, the first of these vehicles will probably be subsidized by the manufacturer.
As demand grows, production costs will drop, and the OEM will eventually realize a profit on these vehicles.
The California ZEV emissions mandate, which goes into effect in 2003, will put pressure on the manufacturers to finalize the technology.
Table 7 lists the light-duty FCVs being developed that will likely be available in the United States, as well as their development stage and estimated time to market introduction.
The biggest issue to enable testing and evaluation of FCVs is fueling infrastructure.
Test methods for the technology will also have to be developed and standardized.

Heavy-Duty Vehicles Fuel cell technology for HDVs has been concentrated on bus applications.
Ballard Power Systems, XCELLSIS Fuel Cell Engines Inc. has been testing its fuel cell prototype bus in Chicago and Vancouver, British Columbia, since 1997.
The demonstration in Chicago has recently ended, with positive results.
During the two-year demonstration, the three fuel cell buses logged more than 5,000 hours in revenue service.
The results from this project helped XCELLSIS design its new pre-commercial fuel cell engine that will enter revenue service in Palm Springs, California, in the summer of 2000.
Ballard's chairman and chief executive officer announced in a
15
recent press release that "A commercial fuel cell bus engine is now just two years away" (source: Ballard press release - 3/23/00).
Table 8 lists ongoing fuel cell demonstration projects in the United States.

Other Advanced Technologies Many other associated technologies could further OTT's goals.
Here are a few: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Advanced fuels for compression-ignition direct-injection engines such as low-sulfur diesel, dimethoxy methane, dimethyl ether, and Fischer-Tropsh New fuels/applications (biodiesel blends in the federal fleet, P-series fuels) Low-cost materials for CNG storage tanks Stirling engine for hybrid systems High-power energy storage devices Lightweight materials for vehicles and systems Gasoline direct injection engines Advanced dedicated CNG/LNG vehicles Dedicated hydrogen buses
Potential Partnerships The FOP must work with industry and other stakeholders to test and promote advanced technology vehicles.
This program is part of a larger effort being conducted in this area by other government offices, engine and vehicle manufacturers, fuel providers, vehicle customers, industry trade organizations, and R
The program can maximize its limited resources by working with groups with similar goals.
Program administrators should meet with these groups regularly, involve them in peer reviews of program plans and results, and find projects that leverage funding wherever possible.
The FOP could partner with a wide range of organizations and projects.
This includes activities from within DOE's OTT, other government organizations such as the Federal Transit Administration, industry trade groups such as the Electric Vehicle Association of America, automobile and component manufacturers, and private testing organizations.
The focus, direction, and funding of transportation programs and the marketplace for advanced technologies are continually changing and developing.
Program representatives must maintain an awareness of the latest events so that program activities align with trends in technology and with the needs of our customers.
The challenge will be to choose those projects that provide the greatest return in terms of impact on energy security and air quality, value to our customers, and leveraging of funds.
