THE INDIANA DRIVER LICENSE
CHAPTER A PURPOSE: An Indiana drivers license is an identification card issued by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (hereinafter, the BMV) that indicates the extent of a person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle.
Law enforcement of ficers use the license to identify drivers and access driving records.
Individuals also use licenses to prove identity, as for instance when writing checks.
A license may be obtained by making an application at any of the local license branches in this state.
Check your phone director y for the nearest license branch.
This ar ticle of the manual explains the eligibility requirements for the various types of licenses issued by the BMV in detail.
CHAPTER B WHEN A DRIVER LICENSE IS REQUIRED: 1.
General Rule: To operate a vehicle in this state a person must have a valid Indiana driver license issued by the BMV applicable to the type of vehicle being operated.
Driving a motor vehicle in the State of Indiana is a privilege and not a right.
New residents to Indiana must obtain a license (and register and title all vehicles) within sixty (60) days of moving to this state.
For more information concer ning vehicle registration and titling requirements see Ar ticle V of this manual.

legal residence is in another state if you have lived in Indiana for over half of a calendar year (except college students and active members of the militar y), are registered to vote in Indiana, or have children in an Indiana school system.
CHAPTER C APPLICATION/PROOF OF IDENTITY: If you are making an application for an Indiana driver license, permit or identification card, you will be required to provide proof of your identity.
The Bureau of Motor Vehicles has joined many other states in the countr y in revising its driver license policy to enhance the security of our driver license system.
This policy requires more documentation and is intended to minimize the occur rence of identity fraud.
Driver licenses are accepted all over the countr y as an indicator of a person's identity.
It is ver y impor tant that we protect a person's identity by making our system as secure as possible.
To preser ve the integrity of the driver license for identification purposes, the BMV has established guidlines of acceptable forms of proof of identity, which includes name, date of bir th, Indiana residency and social security number.
Please contact your local license branch for a cur rent acceptable ID list or logon to http://www.bmvexpress.IN.gov.
