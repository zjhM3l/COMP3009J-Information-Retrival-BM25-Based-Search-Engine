Back to Arson Page NFPA LOGO Fact Sheet on Arson and Church Fires in the U.S.A __________________________________________________________________ * Arson is America's No. 1 fire cause for property damage, causing more than $2 billion of direct damages in a typical year, or about one of every four dollars lost to fire.
* There are more than 500,000 reported fires per year that are estimated to be arson, most of them outdoor trash or brush fires, or about one of every four reported fires per year.
* Arson and associated losses have declined for most of the past two decades.
Since the late 1980s, the declines in arson fires in buildings have been more modest and less consistent, year-to-year.
* Churches and related properties are not a major part of the U.S. arson problem, accounting for well under 1% of reported incendiary and suspicious fires in structures.
* However, arson is the leading cause of fire in churches and related properties, accounting for more than one of every four reported church property fires and two-fifths of the reported property damage in those fires.
* There have been just under 600 reported incendiary or suspicious fires per year in churches and related properties in recent years.
The trend has been very favorable, from 1,420 arson fires in churches and related properties in 1980 to 520 such fires in 1994, the lowest level recorded in that decade and a half.
Related property damage was $16 million in 1994, compared to $20-30 million in most recent years.
* The trend has also been steadily favorable for reported fires of all causes in churches and related properties, declining from an average of 2,600 fires per year in 1985-1989 to an average of 2,100 fires per year in 1990-1994.
There are more than 300,000 churches in the U.S. (counting reported churches from religious bodies reporting at least 200,000 members), which means each year there is roughly one reported fire for every 150 churches.
* Fires in church properties can be particularly difficult to fight.
* There is no typical church arsonist.
Arson fires documented in NFPA's One Stop Data Shop's package (Internet: OSDS@NFPA.org) on church fires include such diverse circumstances as fires set to conceal burglaries, juvenile firesetting to retaliate for church school punishments, and fires set by adults impaired by chronic abuse of alcohol.
