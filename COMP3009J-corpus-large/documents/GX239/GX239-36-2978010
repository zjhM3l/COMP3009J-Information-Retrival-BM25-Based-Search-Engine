BACKGROUND The invention at issue in this appeal relates to personal digital assistants (PDAs).
A user can store "electronic The More
books," e.g., lists of telephone numbers, in a PDA.
invention helps a user "navigate" through such a book.
specifically, it allows him to determine where he is located within the book, what other material is available in the book, and how to get to other locations in the book.
Claim 1, which is representative for our purposes, follows: 1.
A method of controlling the display of an book on a display screen of a hand-held stylus-based having a processor connected to the display screen, connected to the processor, one or more buttons, and the method comprising: electronic computer a memory a stylus,
opening a book package which contains the electronic book and which resides, at least in part, in the memory of the computer; displaying a view of a current page of the electronic book on the display screen, the view including at least one navigation button; displaying a navigation dialog box on the display when the navigation button is selected by interaction stylus with the display screen, the navigation dialog having at least a bookmark button and a return to menu screen of the box button;

We next recall that in rejecting claims under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103, the patent examiner bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of obviousness.
A prima facie
case is established when the teachings from the prior art itself would appear to have suggested the claimed subject matter to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
If the
examiner fails to establish a prima facie case, an obviousness rejection is improper and will be overturned.

rejections.

In response, the
appellants argue that none of the references suggest displaying a menu button in a navigation dialog box together with a bookmark button.
They urge that although Soviero
teaches a menu button, nothing in the reference suggests that actuating the button will display a page listing book destinations.

Although Soviero teaches a MENU button, it does not accompany the button with a bookmark button or place it in a navigation dialog box.
In contrast, the MENU button stands-alone.
Although Slate teaches the "Bookmark" command, it does not accompany the command with a return to menu button.

the function of the claimed return to menu button.
foregoing reasons, the examiner failed to show the references would have suggested displaying a navigation dialog box or displaying a menu page as in independent claim 1 and its dependent claims 2-13 and 39.
Accordingly, we find the
examiner's rejection of these claims does not amount to a prima facie case of obviousness.
Because the examiner has not
established a prima facie case, the rejection of claims 1-13 and 39 is improper.
Therefore, we reverse the rejection of
the claims 1-13 and 39 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103.
Rejection of Claims 14-18 and 40 Regarding independent claim 14, the examiner makes a blanket obviousness rejection.
Claim 14 is rejected "per the (Examiner's
rationale of claims 1-3 as it applies to menus."

The rejection lacks analysis.
The examiner
fails to map the

claim language to the disclosures of Capps, Soviero, or Slate.
Their is no indication of what language is missing from any of the references.
In addition, the examiner omits an
explanation of the proposed combination of the references or why one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to form the combination.
In response the appellants observe
the discussions regarding menus in the cited art describe, at best, basic features unrelated to the suite of navigation features of the claimed invention.

We find the references would not have suggested the step of displaying a browser of claim 14.

failed to show the references would have suggested displaying a browser as in independent claim 14 and its dependent claims 15-18 and 40.
Accordingly, we find the examiner's rejection
of these claims does not amount to a prima facie case of obviousness.
Because the examiner has not established a prima
facie case, the rejection of claims 14-18 and 40 is improper.
Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claims 14-18 and 40 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103.
Rejection of Claims 31 and 35-38 We begin our consideration of the obviousness of claims 31 and 35-38 by recalling that during patent examination, pending claims must be given their broadest reasonable interpretation.

The seventh element of claim 31 specifies "navigation means for changing the current page to a marked page and displaying it when a bookmark button associated with the marked page is selected from the navigation dialog box by interaction of the stylus with the display screen."
(Amendment A at 6.)
As aforementioned, Slate's bookmarks
permit a user to tap a stylus to "zip" to marked sections.
One of ordinary skill in the art would have understood that when a user "zips" to a marked section, the current page is changed to the marked page.

Giving the claim its broadest
reasonable interpretation, we find that the claimed invention does not define over the references.
The claim specifies a browser as follows:
Appeal No. 97-1223 Application No. 08/147,143
Page 18
a browser represented by a browser window displayed on the display means, the browser window listing a plurality of subjects describing sections of the contents of the electronic book, wherein the first page of a section described by a subject is selected when that subject is selected from the browser window.
(Amendment A at 7.)
The references would have suggested the claimed browser.
Soviero's notepad screen is a browser window for the entire contents of its PDA, i.e., the PDA's electronic book.
A
plurality of subjects, e.g., Who, What, and When, are listed pictorially (i.e., by icons) along the bottom of the window.
Who describes an address book; What describes a to-do list; and When describes a calendar.
When one of the subjects is
selected from the widow, the first page of the section described by the subject is selected.
For example, pressing P.
"Who" takes a user to the first page of the address book.

One of ordinary skill in the art would have understood
the dedicated function buttons 64 of Capps to operate in the same manner.
Therefore, we find the references would have
suggested the browser of claim 35.

Appeal No. 97-1223 Application No. 08/147,143

Regarding claim 38, giving the claim it broadest reasonable interpretation, we find that the claimed invention does not define over the references.
The claim specifies in
pertinent part "a page number dialog box displayed when a page number button is selected, the page number dialog box having a field in which a page number handwritten with the stylus is recognized by the handwriting recognizer, wherein the means
for specifying one of said plurality of pages as the current page specifies the page having the recognized page number as the current page."
(Amendment A at 7.)
The prior art would have suggested the page number dialog box and means for specifying.
Slate teaches a "Find" dialog
box, which is displayed when a user scrawls "F" on the screen.
The dialog box has a field in which text entries are recognized.
P. 2.
Similarly, the use of "Go To" dialog boxes
in personal and portable computers to facilitate moving to a specific page was old and well known in the art at the time of the invention.
A user would generally type the number of a
page to which he wanted to move into the Go To dialog box to jump to the page.
Official notice is taken thereof.
As

handwriting entered into a
At the time the invention was made, therefore, it would
have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains to combine the handwriting recognizer of Capps with the dialog boxes of Slate and the prior art as a whole to permit entry of page numbers in handwriting to obtain the claimed invention as specified in claim 38.
The motivation to have done so would have been to
replace a bulky keyboard with a small stylus, which is central to the ideas of a PDA.
Therefore, we find the prior art would
have suggested the page number dialog box and means for specifying of claim 38.
Rejection of Claims 32-34 Relevant to claim 32, the examiner concludes it would have been obvious to define a bookmark to convey the content of the marked page using text or image so that the user has a better idea of the information book marked and can traverse easily to the various pages that are book marked.

examiner failed to show the references would have suggested the button of claim 33.
Accordingly, we find the examiner's
rejection of this claim does not amount to a prima facie case of obviousness.
Regarding claim 34, the examiner rejects the claim under the same rationale used to reject claims 1-13 and 39.
(Examiner's Answer at 7.)
We find the references would not
Appeal No. 97-1223 Application No. 08/147,143
Page 25
have suggested the menu page button of claim 34.
Claim 34
recites in pertinent part "the contents of the electronic book include one or more menu pages which provide navigational assistance within the electronic book, the menu page immediately preceding the current page becoming the current page when a menu page button in the navigation dialog box is selected ...."

Capps nor Slate teaches a menu page button.
Although Soviero
teaches a MENU button as aforementioned, it is unclear what contents are displayed when the menu button is selected.
Thus, it is unclear whether it performs the function of the claimed menu page button.
For the foregoing reasons, the
examiner failed to show the references would have suggested the menu page button of claim 34.
Accordingly, we find the
examiner's rejection of this claim does not amount to a prima facie case of obviousness.
Because the examiner has not
Appeal No. 97-1223 Application No. 08/147,143
Page 26
established a prima facie case, the rejection of claims 32-34 is improper.
Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claims
32-34 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103.
We end our consideration of the obviousness of the claims by concluding we are not required to raise or consider any issues not argued by the appellants.
Our reviewing court
stated, "[i]t is not the function of this court to examine the claims in greater detail than argued by an appellant, looking for nonobvious distinctions over the prior art."
In re Baxter
Travenol Labs., 952 F.2d 388, 391, 21 USPQ2d 1281, 1285 (Fed.
Cir. 1991).
37 C.F.R. Â§ 1.192(a), as amended at 60 Fed.
Reg. 14518 (Mar. 17, 1995), was controlling when the appeal brief was filed.
Section 1.192(a) stated as follows.
The brief . . . must set forth the authorities and arguments on which the appellant will rely to maintain the appeal.
Any arguments or authorities not included in the brief may be refused consideration by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, unless good cause is shown.
Appeal No. 97-1223 Application No. 08/147,143
Page 27
Also at the time of the brief, 37 C.F.R. Â§ 1.192(c)(8)(iv) stated as follows.
For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103, the argument shall specify the errors in the rejection and, if appropriate, the specific limitations in the rejected claims which are not described in the prior art relied on in the rejection, and shall explain how such limitations render the claimed subject matter unobvious over the prior art.
If the rejection is based upon a combination of references, the argument shall explain why the references, taken as a whole, do not suggest the claimed subject matter, and shall include, as may be appropriate, an explanation of why features disclosed in one reference may not properly be combined with features disclosed in another reference.
A general argument that all the limitations are not described in a single reference does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.
In summary, section 1.192 provides that just as the court is not under any burden to raise or consider issues not argued by the appellants, the Board of Patent Appeals And Interferences is also not under any such burden.
Appeal No. 97-1223 Application No. 08/147,143
Page 28
CONCLUSION To summarize, the decision of the examiner to reject claims 1-18, 32-34, and 39-40 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 103 is reversed.
The examiner's decision to reject claims 31 and 35-
38 under Â§ 103 is sustained.
No time period for taking subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 C.F.R. Â§ 1.136(a).
