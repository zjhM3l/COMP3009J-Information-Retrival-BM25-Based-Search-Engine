[ PLD HEADER IMAGE ] __________________________________________________________________ Planned Distribution of Compact Discs From Settlement of Price Fixing Lawsuit May, 2003 Wisconsin, along with other states, will be benefiting from the settlement of a lawsuit brought against a number of music companies and retailers.
The lawsuit charged that the defendant companies engaged in price fixing of compact discs.
The proposed settlement of the lawsuit for Wisconsin includes the distribution of 105,577 compact discs to Wisconsin public libraries on the basis of estimated library service area population (but, with the provision that no library receive less than 25 compact discs).
Compact discs titles will be allocated by computer program and directly shipped to each library by the organization responsible for administration of the settlement.
The planned distribution (which must be approved at a final court hearing) is below.
