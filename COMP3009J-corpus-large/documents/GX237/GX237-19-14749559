Patient Information Publications Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center National Institutes of Health Understanding Your Complete Blood Count This information was developed by your nursing staff to help you understand your complete blood count.
Â·
Part 1: The measurements in a complete blood count What is a complete blood count? A complete blood count, often referred to as a CBC, is a common blood test.
A CBC provides detailed information about three types of cells in your blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
These blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue filling the center of your bones.
Bone marrow in the skull, sternum (breast bone), ribs, vertebral column (backbone), and pelvis produces these blood cells.
Each type of blood cell plays an important role in your body's normal function.
What does a complete blood count measure? A complete blood count includes five major measurements: Â· white blood cell (WBC) count White blood cells fight infections.
They are measured in thousands per cubic milliliter (K/mm3) of blood.
Â· red blood cell (RBC) count Red blood cells carry oxygen to and remove waste products from the body 's tissues.
These cells also contain hemoglobin.
Red blood cells are measured in millions per cubic millimeter (mil/mm3) of blood.
Patient Information Publications
hemoglobin (HGB) value Hemoglobin gives red blood cells their color.
Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and takes carbon dioxide (the waste products) from the tissues to the lungs.
From the lungs, carbon dioxide is exhaled.Hemoglobin is measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL) of blood.
hematocrit (HCT) value The hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cells in relation to your total blood volume.
platelet count.
Platelets help to stop bleeding by forming blood clots.
They are measured in thousands per cubic millimeter (K/mm3) of blood.
Â·
Â·
What are the normal ranges of these measurements? Each measurement in a complete blood count has a normal range: Â· WBC: 3.4-9.6 K/mm3 Â· RBC: 3.58-4.99 mil/mm3 Â· Â· Â· HGB: 11.1-15.0 g/dL HCT: 31.8-43.2% Platelets: 162-380 K/mm3.
You will see these ranges on your complete blood count.

Part 2: A more detailed look at what the complete blood count measures White blood cells These cells are the mobile units of the body's infection-fighting system.
White blood cells travel in the bloodstream to areas of infection and destroy the responsible bacteria.
However, the WBC lab value is not meaningful unless the "differential" is also known.
The differential The differential measures each of the five types of white blood cells: Â· neutrophils (polys and bands) Â· Â· Â· Â· basophils eosinophils lymphocytes monocytes.
What is the ANC or AGC? The absolute neutrophil count (ANC), also called absolute granulocyte count (AGC), is the measure of the number of infection-fighting white blood cells in your blood.
How is the ANC calculated? To calculate the ANC, the number of white blood cells and the percentage of polys and bands must be known.
Then, the number of white blood cells is multiplied by the percentage of polys and bands.
For example, let the number of white blood cells be 300.
(This number would be 0.3 on the lab sheet.
To get this number, move the decimal three places to the right.)
Let the number of polys be 10 percent (0.10), and bands 5 percent (0.05).
The ANC is found by doing the following: 300 x (0.10 + 0.05) = 300 x 0.15 = 45 The ANC is 45.
Three more examples of these calculations are at the end of this information.
The normal ranges shown are based on adult women; adult men's and children's ranges will be slightly different.
The differential is usually based on 100 cells counted in a laboratory sample.
What are neutrophils? Neutrophils are the most numerous white blood cells.
They make up about 56 percent of white blood cells.
Neutrophils are the "soldiers" that fight infections.
They eat or gobble up the infectious particles (bacteria) in your body.
On your lab sheet, you will see the words "polys" and "bands."
Polys are mature neutrophils; bands are young polys, which also fight infections.

Part 3: Low blood counts--neutropenia What does it mean to have a low ANC or an ANC lower than 500? The normal neutrophil count is 2,500-6,000.
When you have 1,000 or fewer neutrophils, your risk of infection is increased.
When your ANC is lower than 500, you are at risk for getting a serious infection.
This condition is called "neutropenia."
If you are neutropenic and develop a fever or signs of infection, contact your doctor immediately.
You may be given antibiotics to fight the infection.
If I am neutropenic, should I take special care of myself ? If your ANC is low, be alert for the following signs and symptoms of infection: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· fever (temperature higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) shaking chills flushed skin sweating frequent urination or burning when urinating redness, tenderness, or pain anywhere on the body general feeling of tiredness or flu-like symptoms (sore throat, sneezing, runny nose, coughing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, chest discomfort).
If I am neutropenic, how can I prevent myself from getting infections? The following list contains information to help you care for yourself while you are neutropenic.
Neutropenia precautions list To prevent or detect infections, follow these precautions.
General precautions Â· Check your temperature three times a day when you are neutropenic.
If your temperature is 101.3 Â°F* or greater once, or if your temperature is 100.4 Â°F or greater two times in 24 hours, notify your nurse or doctor.
Take Tylenol only on your doctor 's advice.
Do not take aspirin.
Â· Check for signs of infection in such areas as the site of a Hickman catheter or Port-aCath, or any tube or catheter site.
Also check the mouth, groin, and perineum (the area between the penis and the rectum in men, and between the vagina and rectum in women).
Signs of infection include redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage, or odor.
If you have any signs of infection, notify your nurse or doctor.
If you are neutropenic and have any of these signs or symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.
Personal hygiene Â· Shower or bathe daily.
Give extra attention to washing the underarms, groin, and perineum.
These areas are moist and may harbor germs.
If your skin becomes dry, use lotion or oils to soften it and prevent cracking.
* Â°F means degrees Fahrenheit.
