FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING PROPOSAL TO BREACH AND REMOVE GOOD HOPE DAM, CONODOGUINET CREEK Background: Good Hope Mill Dam is a 5.5 foot high dam on the Conodoguinet Creek in Hamden Township, Cumberland County.
It is located 13.5 river miles upstream of confluence of the Conodoguinet with the Susquehanna River.
The dam creates a pool of about 50 acres.
The pool averages about 220 feet wide and about a mile in length.
The dam is in deteriorated condition.
It meets the statutory definition of a run-of-river dam contained in Act 1998-91, and, under various flow conditions, it displays the dangerous hydraulic characteristics of a low-head dam.
The dam will have to be marked as a dangerous dam.
The dam has no fish passage facilities.
It is an impediment to the restoration of migratory fishes to the Conodoguinet and to the free movement of resident fishes on the stream.
Who owns Good Hope Dam? Good Hope Dam is an orphan dam with no identified owner.
In 1963 and, again in 1998, the Good Hope Mill Dam Association applied for and received permits from the Departments of Forest and Waters and Environmental Resources to make repairs to this dam.
Conodoguinet Creek is considered navigable waters of the Commonwealth.
The bed of the creek thus belongs to the Commonwealth in its sovereign capacity, but no state agency operates and maintains Good Hope Dam or exercises ownership over it.
What is the current status of the dam? The dam is in a state of disrepair.
As it continues to deteriorate, future breaches are inevitable.
Is removal of the dam inevitable? Unless someone comes forward to undertake a project to repair the dam and bring it up to current standards of safety and fish passage, it is inevitable that the dam will be removed sooner or later by natural processes or concerted action.
The dam is a recognized threat to public safety, and it has adverse environmental impacts.
Bringing the dam up to standards will be a very expensive proposition.
No one should expect the Commonwealth to provide the necessary resources to refurbish or replace the dam and provide permanent fish passage facilities.
The opportunity exists with available federal funding to remove the dam in a controlled manner as to minimize environmental impacts and public hazards.
If the dam is allowed to breach itself on its own accord, funding to mitigate environmental impacts and riparian restoration may not be available.
If a group or entity is willing to take responsibility and liability for the dam, including conducting structural repairs, installation of fish passage, and annual operation and maintenance, the dam could possibly remain.
This will be a very expensive alternative.
If the dam is removed, what are the anticipated changes upstream? Removing the dam would permit the stream to return to its historic channel.
The water level upstream of the dam will decrease in the pooled area.
The amount of the decrease would be greatest at the dam which stands approximately 5.5 feet in height, and the water level decrease will be less upstream of the dam.
Stream width and depth would be similar to free-flowing sections of Conodoguinet Creek above and below the impoundment.
If the dam is removed, what are the anticipated changes downstream? No change in stream flow or water level would be expected downstream as a result of removing the dam.
Levels of dissolved oxygen in the water should increase in response to elimination the impoundment and associated macrophytes (aquatic plants).
Since the dam serves no flood control purpose, flooding willnot increase.
How much migratory fish habitat is the PFBC trying to restore? The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission is actively trying to restore migratory fishes to their historic distribution within the Susquehanna watershed providing water quality is permitting.
What impact will removing the dam have on fish and other aquatic organisms? Stream fishes and other flowing water organisms will be enhanced.
These organisms rely on stream bottoms free of sediment.
The dam reduces water velocity, resulting in deposition of sediment and organic materials which covers and smothers the stream bottom and uses up oxygen.
What impact will removing the dam have on present wildlife in the area of the dam? Localized changes in the composition and abundance of certain species that use the impoundment should be anticipated.
Wildlife would be similar to the free-flowing sections of Conodoguinet Creek.
How will American shad and other fish migrate upstream if shallow water results from removing the dam? Fish can swim in shallow water albeit the migration period for shad and herring occurs in the spring during which time seasonal water flows are highest.
What is necessary to keep the dam and impoundment? Someone or some group would have to take financial responsibility for repairing and maintaining the dam as well as constructing fish passage facilities and providing annual operation and maintenance of those facilities.
Isn't Orr's Bridge Dam a blockage to fish migration? No.
Orr's Bridge Dam is constructed in a manner that permits the migratory movements of fish past the dam.
What impact will removing the dam have on flooding? The dam serves no flood control purpose.
Stream levels and flows downstream of the dam will not be affected after removal of the dam.
Water levels in the pool area will be somewhat lower with the dam removed including under flooding conditions.
What impact will removing the dam have on boating? Restoration of the original stream channel and associated increases in water velocity would impact boating.
Boating opportunities would be similar to those which presently exist in free flowing areas of the stream.
Who is liable for the dam? The owner or permittee.
If none can be identified, the Commonwealth may assume ownership.
How will the exposed shore line, unstable banks and odor be addressed? Provisions for stream bank stabilization and riparian restoration will be included in the formal proposal and to remove the dam.
A detailed erosion and sedimentation control plan and environmental impact assessment are requirements under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Restoration Wavier which grants regulatory approval to remove the dam.
Stream sediment emits a unpleasant odor when wet; it also drys quickly.
We have not had any complaints regarding odor at any of our other removal projects nor have we experienced the formation of stagnate pools.
Does an environmental assessment need to be conducted? An environmental assessment will be conducted by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Dam Safety, as part of the issuance of the Restoration Waiver to remove the dam.
This is a regulatory requirement.
Will the shoreline be filled, graded, and seeded to present ground bank levels following removal of the dam? Provisions for stream bank stabilization and re-vegetation will be included in the formal proposal to remove the dam.
However, this is not envisioned to include filling in the flood plane and landscaping.
This must be done in accordance with the required erosion and sedimentation plan which is approved by the County Conservation Districts.
Volunteers have offered assistance to pick up debris and plant vegetation following removal of the dam.
How long will it take to make repairs to property owners land after the dam is removed? No damage is expected on lands above the present water level.
Some additional land would be exposed with lower water levels following removal of the dam.
Generally, one full growing season should be permitted to allow vegetation to regrow in these areas.
At the end of that period, site inspection will determine if additional riparian vegetation and stream bank stabilization actions are required.
The site inspection will be coordinated with the County Conservation District.
Will shad and other fish be stocked after removing the dam? The PFBC began stocking shad and herring in Conodoguinet Creek in 1995 and will continue stocking this year and in the future.
Plans call to continue stocking and monitoring until a viable population of these species is reestablished.
Is the government prepared to purchase private property before removing the dam? There is no plan to purchase private property in this project.
There are more than 400 dams in Pennsylvania that need repair.
Besides money, why is the government not accepting responsibility to fix this dam and install fish ladders? Dam owners have the responsibility to repair, maintain and provide fish passage.
As old age continues to affect these dams, more problems can be expected by the owners.
Where no owner can be found for a dam the Commonwealth may need to assume responsibilities in the public interests.
Should the project to remove the dam be approved, what is the anticipated start date? The project could take place as early as the year 2000.
How long will the project take? The physical removal of the dam generally would take less than one or two weeks to complete; with start up and riparian vegetation restoration and bank stabilization would require a maximum of two complete growing seasons.
Will fishing be affected by removal of the dam? Fishing at the base of dams is usually good because fish moving upstream congregate there, unable go further.
If the dam is removed, fish will no longer concentrate at the base.
Removal of the dam will enhance habitat for stream fishes resulting in increased stream angling opportunities.
Aren't there current laws that require fish passage devices on dams and isn't the dam in its present state actually an illegal obstruction? Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes Act 1980-175, Title 30, Chapter 35, requires any person(s) erecting or maintaining a dam in the waters of the Commonwealth upon written order of the PFBC erect and maintain fish passage devices that enable fish to ascend and descend the waters at all times of the year.
Who are the beneficiaries of the shad restoration program?.
It is estimated that shad restoration in the Susquehanna River basin will create 500,000 angling trips per year and provide $35 million dollars annually to local economies.
Native flora and fauna in Conodoguinet Creek will benefit when free flowing river conditions are restored.
Increased numbers of juvenile shad and herring will provide enormous forage for game fish in the Susquehanna Basin.
