It has existed for hundreds of years, worldwide.
However, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Federal Legislation - P.L. 101-646 as amended in 1990) is helping to sensitize U.S. citizens to the effects of homelessness and the need for assistance for those who experience it.
Educators as well as the general public are being asked by many action groups to develop an awareness of and sensitivity to this dilemma in order to address the needs of those who experience homelessness.
This resource guide was developed within Iowa to convey to all students the immediate reality of homelessness and how to help.
It represents a response for developing awareness and encouraging involvement.
The persons involved in the development of this guide tried to structure the activities to be sensitive to all children.
They utilized the principle that "activities to introduce children and adults to homelessness should not offend those who are, nor should it overwhelm those who are not."
However, those who use the activities in this guide need to be sensitive to local concerns regarding homeless children and adults and use the most appropriate activities accordingly.
The following lesson samples are intended to offer guidelines for addressing the issue of homelessness with students.
Schools are urged to take an "adopt and adapt" attitude: adopt the concepts and adapt them to the specific situation.
The lesson plans shown are developed for varying age and ability levels; even slight changes can make them usable in a variety of settings to accomplish many different purposes.
Implications can be drawn and individualized plans created from these materials.
The activities were designed by Iowa educators serving children at different levels of development.
Resources are identified throughout the publication.
The specific intent of disseminating this information is to provide a supportive basis from which both teachers and students can gain new insights.
In particular, the intent for teachers is to provide some basis for establishing student understanding of their peers for whom life has been less than kind, and to allow students opportunities for assisting.

WHY STUDY HOMELESSNESS?
The problems that homelessness brings to any individual, family, community and national government create human suffering.
Homelessness results in people trying to satisfy basic human physical and safety needs, sacrificing all other life needs, especially the need to achieve in school and establish high self esteem.
Consequently, homelessness is a social problem that immediately brings up housing and poverty dilemmas.
Studying the problem should: * Provide students an opportunity to deal with a current issue of concern to Iowa and the nation and to dispel myths about people without homes.
* Give students a chance to make a contribution toward ending homelessness.
* Sensitize students to be more accepting of students in their school who might be without a home.
* Provide opportunity for schools to interact with the community to establish cooperative partnerships to assist those who are homeless.

HOMELESSNESS IN IOWA
Iowa is a beautiful land with proud people dedicated to helping each other and working hard to overcome problems.
Homelessness is such a problem.
However, accepting the fact that homelessness exists is not an easy matter for Iowans and some denial pervades our citizenry.
Some Iowans do not feel that it is politically or economically wise to admit that homelessness exists and to what extent it exists.
They feel that if the problem looks too pervasive to outsiders, we might not be able to attract outside economic interests.
Studies of Iowa's homeless indicate that during any given year nearly 16,000 people are homeless by being on the streets, living in abandoned buildings, tents or shelters and transition housing or finding temporary shelter with friends or relatives.
Over 60 percent of our homeless are children of preschool through high school age.
The education of our homeless children remains a primary issue especially since so many of our homeless are children and homelessness can interrupt their schooling.
The governor of Iowa (Terry Branstad) established a special office to coordinate agencies and services for the homeless.
At least 15 different agencies and organizations are coordinated via the Interagency Task Force on Homelessness spearheaded by the Office on Homelessness, Department of Human Services.
A major goal of the task force is to eliminate homelessness and the harmful ramifications that homelessness brings to children and adults.
An "Iowa Plan to Eliminate Homelessness" now exists but requires Iowans statewide to get involved and serve to assist those in need.
Many factors in Iowa cause someone to become homeless.
The most frequently identified are: unemployment, de-institutionalization of the mentally ill, personal crises such as abandonment and divorce or physical abuse, cuts in public assistance programs, the rising costs of housing, and personal difficulties such as alcohol or drug abuse.
The causes of homelessness cannot be controlled by the children involved.
Many of the causes cannot be totally controlled by adults, especially those personally involved.
Homelessness is a circumstance and those caught by the circumstance normally look for assistance and are willing to accept help.
When assistance is provided the homeless do overcome the devastating effects.
