Abstract Public and private land managers are interested in monitoring amphibian populations to evaluate the risk of population declines.
In this report, we describe monitoring methods and resources useful for biologists undertaking monitoring of amphibians breeding in pond environments in the northcentral USA.
We include states in the U.S. Geological Survey Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative, Upper Mississippi Region (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin).
The monitoring resources are derived from the literature and our experiences with a study of amphibians breeding in small farm ponds in southeastern Minnesota (Driftless Area Ecoregion) conducted from 2000 to 2001.
We provide an overview of methods and list resources for conducting anuran calling surveys, egg mass surveys, larval surveys, and amphibian deformity assessments, and we list precautions to prevent the spread of diseases.
We also present one method of collecting habitat information associated with a breeding site.
The appendixes list equipment and resources useful for conducting amphibian surveys.
Examples of data sheets are provided, along with a list of amphibians present in the northcentral USA.

Resources for monitoring
Introduction Declines in amphibian populations around the world, including some in the northcentral USA (Hay 1998; Lannoo 1998; Bury 1999; Alford et al. 2001) and high rates of deformed frogs in some locations (Helgen et al. 1998) have stimulated interest in amphibians as bioindicators of the health of ecosystems.
Public and private land managers are interested in monitoring amphibian populations to evaluate the risk of population declines (Mossman et al. 1998).
We describe monitoring methods and resources useful for biologists undertaking monitoring of amphibians breeding in pond environments in the northcentral USA.
We included states in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI), Upper Mississippi Region (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin).
The monitoring resources are derived from the literature and our experiences in a study of amphibians breeding in small farm ponds in southeastern Minnesota (Driftless Area Ecoregion) conducted from 2000 to 2001 (Knutson et al. 2002).
As concern about amphibians increases, more agencies and herpetologists are engaged in monitoring activities.
Amphibian monitoring methods are rapidly evolving because new research is focusing on improving monitoring methods.
The USGS ARMI is monitoring amphibians across the USA and is a resource for monitoring methods (http://www.mp2pwrc.usgs.gov/armi/index.cfm).
The USGS Science Centers with active research on amphibians in the northcentral USA include Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (La Crosse, Wisconsin), Northern Prairie
Wildlife Research Center (Jamestown, North Dakota), National Wildlife Health Center (Madison, Wisconsin), and Columbia Environmental Research Center (Columbia, Missouri) (http://biology.usgs.gov/pub_aff/centers.html).
General Considerations Anyone undertaking amphibian survey work has a responsibility to avoid harming the amphibians or their habitats.
Persons planning to sample amphibians should work in cooperation wit h state or federal wildlife professionals.
Lack of knowledge about sensitive habitats or populations could result in the spread of diseases, damage to breeding habitats, or local reproductive failure of amphibian populations.
State and federal laws protect amphibians from exploitation.
Collection permits are required from the appropriate state and/or federal authorities before collecting or handling amphibians.
Consult your state wildlife management agency for guidance.
Permission for sampling should also be obtained from the landowner.
Qualifications and Training Biologists undertaking amphibian surveys should be familiar with the amphibian species in their area.
A number of field guides and general herpetology references are available to assist biologists who are unfamiliar with amphibians (Wright and Wright 1949; Conant and Collins 1991; Stebbins and Cohen 1995; Harding 1997; Petranka 1998; Moriarty and Bauer 2000).
Surveyors should be able to identify anurans by call and identify amphibian adults, eggs, and larvae in the field by sight or through the use of keys (Altig et al. 1998; Parmelee et 6.2 Resources for monitoring
al. 2002).
In addition, skills in the identification of aquatic vegetation are useful.
Training with a professional is strongly encouraged.
Some universities offer herpetology courses as part of their academic program and some offer short summer courses at biological field stations.
For biologists new to amphibian surveys, we recommend consulting herpetologists in your state to assist you.
Collecting and Handling While performing amphibian surveys, it may be necessary to handle amphibian eggs, larvae, and adults.
The following procedures will minimize the risk of injury to amphibians during collecting and handling (Fellers et al. 1994; Lips et al. 2001).
Before handling amphibian eggs, larvae, or adults, wash your hands so they are free of soap, insect repellent, sunscreen lotion, and any other potential toxins.
Hands should be moistened with water before handling any amphibians.
Handling of amphibian eggs should be minimized.
When possible, identify eggs in place.
Larvae should be handled with a dip net and not removed from the water for more than 2 min.
During larval surveys, larvae can be held in buckets filled with pond water and placed in a cool place out of direct sunlight.
Larvae should be released as soon as they are identified.
released back into the environment.
They should be euthanized and either preserved as voucher specimens, or disposed of properly (Green 2001).
If sampling will include contact between field gear (footwear, clothing, and equipment) and aquatic habitats, preventing contamination among sites is important.
To prevent the spread of diseases from one amphibian population to another, all field gear should be cleaned and sanitized among study sites.
The USGS National Wildlife Health Center (Madison, Wisconsin) has developed standard operating procedures for handling amphibians and disinfecting equipment (Green 2001).
These guidelines also cover biosecurity precautions and reporting procedures if you suspect amphibian disease at a site.
The Fieldwork Code of Practice developed by the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force (http:// www.npwrc.us gs.gov/narcam/techinfo/daptf.ht m) also describes accepted safety precautions to take to prevent the spread of disease.
Sampling Design
Sampling design (where and how frequently to sample) may be the most important consideration in a monitoring study and determines what information can be derived from the data.
Careful planning is especially important if you have specific management objectives for conducting the survey.
If you are Preventing the Spread of Diseases unsure about whether your planned design will meet your management objectives, consult Disposable gloves should be used for references (Thompson et al. 1998; Yoccoz et handling animals when disease is suspected.

Before you start, consider the types of habitats you want to include in your project or study, their size and distribution, and what maps are available showing these habitats.
Stratified random sampling, aided by computer software, is often used to randomly select sample points from different habitat types.
locations where adult frogs and toads are attempting to breed.
Some states have been collecting anuran calling data over the last decade (Hemesath 1998; Mossman et al. 1998).
Amphibian habitat associations have been derived from calling survey data (Knutson et al. 1999; Knutson et al. 2000), as well as population trend estimates (Mossman et al. 1998).
Sampling and Recording Data Anuran calling surveys are easier to perform than egg or larval surveys and are frequently Standard survey techniques for amphibians conducted by volunteers.
However, calling include anuran calling surveys, egg mass surveys do not provide evidence that breeding surveys, larval surveys, and visual searches for is successful.
Eggs, larvae, and metamorphs are adults (Heyer et al. 1994; Olsen et al. 1997). needed to confirm successful reproduction for For those unfamiliar with amphibians, locating, anurans.

recordings will point out these differences.
During daylight hours, bird songs may sound like amphibians.
Later in the summer, a variety of insect calls must be distinguished from anuran calls.
Protocols for anuran calling surveys have been developed by the USGS North American Amphibian Monitoring Program (NAAMP 2002).
Several states have state anuran calling programs that cooperate with North American Amphibian Monitoring Program.
We recommend using protocols adopted by your state wildlife management agency so that your data are compatible with other, similar data collected in your state.
Numerous resources, including sound recordings, are available to help you learn the calls for frogs in your area (Appendix C).
Times and minimum air temperature guidelines are available to plan the timing of calling surveys in each state (NAAMP 2002).
Visual Encounter Surveys Visual encounter surveys identify amphibian adults and possibly metamorphs at a site.
The details of conducting visual searches have been described in several references (Crump and Scott 1994; Olsen et al. 1997).
adult anurans, their eggs, and their choice of egg- laying sites.
Polarized sunglasses help reduce glare when searching for eggs during the day.
Each species lays its eggs in characteristic ways (Stebbins and Cohen 1995).
Most ranids lay their eggs in large masses, either in floating sheets or spherical masses near the water's surface, sometimes attached to vegetation.
Toads lay eggs in long strings, typically in shallow water.
Treefrogs lay their eggs in small masses or individually, attached to vegetation.
Pond - breeding salamanders usually lay their eggs in masses attached to vegetation, at or below the water surface.
While not all amphibians attach their eggs to vegetation, vegetation (living and dead) is often used for support by amphibians during the egg- laying process.
As a result, pond - breeding amphibian eggs are usually found in association with vegetation.
All pond- breeding amphibians in our region have pigmented eggs (Parmelee et al. 2002).
Eggs or egg masses that are white or translucent are likely snail eggs that can be quite large.
Larval Surveys
Performing larval surveys is another method of detecting the presence of pond - breeding Egg Mass Surveys amphibians.
The presence of larvae is good evidence that breeding was successful and that Egg mass surveys provide evidence that site conditions support larval development.
mating occurred.
The number of egg masses is There are a number of methods used to survey also an indication of the number of adults that amphibian larvae (Heyer et al. 1994; Olsen et bred at that location (Crouch and Paton 2000). al. 1997).
We recommend defining a search Some amphibian species are most effectively area for larval surveys.
If your pond is small, surveyed by egg mass surveys because their you may want to search the entire pond.
If your egg masses are large and easily found (Crouch pond is large, you can define a search area, and Paton 2000).
Searching for egg masses such as a 20- m diameter circle.
Most while attempting to locate calling individuals amphibian larvae prefer shallower (
be your focus.
Dip nets or seines can be used to collect larvae.
In our surveys, we attempted to standardize our dip net effort by placing all larvae collected during a 20- min dip net effort in a bucket.
We then identified larvae by species and recorded their abundances (Appendix B).
The ability to successfully collect larvae depends on the density of larvae and the habitat characteristics.
Small, temporary ponds may have relatively high densities of larval amphibians that can be collected with little effort.
Larger, interconnected, permanent wetlands tend to have more dispersed populations of larval amphibians that increases the effort required.
Most amphibian larvae can be found among aquatic vegetation or other sheltering objects, where they seek food and refuge from predators.
Toad tadpoles can often be seen in large schools in shallow, open water.
Collecting amphibian larvae with a dip net requires walking carefully and slowly through the water, sweeping the net through stands of aquatic vegetation.
In shallow, turbid, sparsely vegetated areas, larvae can often be found resting on the bottom.
To prevent the escape of larvae, work from deeper water towards shallower areas.
Immediately place collected larvae in a bucket containing water from the site.
Put 2 to 3 L of water in the bucket and place it out of direct sunlight to prevent the larvae from overheating.
Funnel traps are another tool for collecting larvae (Adams et al. 1997).
Funnel traps are useful when it is logistically feasible to deploy and check them regularly and when dense vegetation impedes the use of dip nets or seines.
Because of the logistical considerations of sampling many sites, we collected the same species with less time using dip nets.
Identifying larvae in the field can be difficult
for novices.
Training by a herpetologist in the field is the best way to learn to identify larvae.
Keys to amphibian larvae and eggs (Watermolen 1995, 1996; Parmelee et al. 2002) are useful in identifying species or groups of species.
Some species can only be differentiated during the larval stage by examination of larval tooth patterns with the aid of a microscope (Altig et al. 1998; McDiarmid and Altig 1999).
We recommend this only if you have training in amphibian larval identification.
If you are unsure of your identifications, options include consulting a herpetologist or raising the larvae in the laboratory and making an identification from a metamorph or juvenile amphibian.
Amphibian Deformity Assessment Recent concerns about amphibian deformities (Helgen et al. 1998; Johnson et al. 1999; Souter 2000; Rosenberry 2001; Johnson et al. 2002) have led management agencies to conduct deformity assessments to assess risks on public lands.
Deformity assessments are usually performed on metamorphs from midJune through mid- August.
Accurate descriptions of any malformations you find are important for identifying causes (Meteyer 2000).
The USGS North American Reporting Center for Amphibian Malformations provides guidance on how to conduct surveys for malformations and report your findings (http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/narcam/ ).
Amphibian Disease Assessment Amphibian disease is an emerging concern among herpetologists.
Amphibian declines and species extinctions may be linked to novel and catastrophic diseases (Hero and Gillespie 1997; Daszak et al. 1999; Carey 2000; Green and 6.6 Resources for monitoring
Sherman 2001; Kiesecker et al. 2001; Young et al. 2001).
If you encounter a die- off or disease outbreak of amphibians, you should act quickly to have the problem diagnosed.
The USGS National Wildlife Health Center (Madison, Wisconsin) is experienced in identifying amphibian pathogens.
The Center has guidelines on handling and shipping specimens for diagnosis (Green 2001).
Contact them for assistance before sending specimens.
Collecting Voucher Specimens To verify the identification of eggs and larvae encountered in the field you will initially need to collect and preserve voucher specimens (McDiarmid 1994); (McDiarmid and Altig 1999; Simmons 2002 (in press)).
A set of voucher specimens can be sent to a specialist for positive identification.
Once you are confident in your identification skills, collections will not be necessary.
Most states require collection permits issued by the state Department of Natural Resources or similar agency.
The permits must be carried in the field during sampling and must accompany any preserved specimens.
Remember to observe all wildlife laws and only collect where it is legal and where the collection of a few individuals will not affect the population.
Species that are classified as endangered, rare, threatened, or of special concern (Appendix E) should be collected only with special permission from appropriate authorities.
Preserving Eggs and Larvae Larvae should be anesthetized according to procedures recommended by Green (2001).
There is no perfect preservative, and the techniques for preserving specimens are still debated (McDiarmid 1994; McDiarmid and
Altig 1999).
We recommend preserving amphibian eggs and larvae by placing them in a small vial filled with a 10% formalin solution.
Alcohol is more pleasant to work with and safer than formaldehyde, but tends to dehydrate specimens.
Whatever preservative you use, read the relevant Material Safety Data Sheets to learn how to safely handle and store that chemical.
Larvae can be placed individually, or as a lot of 5 to 20 individuals in screw top vials.
Do not place too many individuals in one container.
Immediate labeling is a must; use pencil or indelible ink on all submerged tags.
Field tags should be linked to corresponding field notes; labels with detailed information must be kept with the specimens.
Do not rely on your memory as a record of locality, date, and habitat information.
The minimum information includes as follows: date, locality (kilometers from a crossroad or other landmark or GPS coordinates), habitat description, and name of the collector.
We recommend maintaining a numbered log that links to tags on the vials.
Other important information includes notes on live coloration (specimens quickly lose color in preservative).
Specimens should be deposited in a museum or university collection where they can be appropriately cataloged, maintained, and available for researchers worldwide.
Habitat Assessment Decisions about what habitat data to collect should be made by clarifying the research questions.
Measuring habitat variables can be time- consuming.
We tried various methods and found that simple habitat assessments were best, unless you have a specific need to be more detailed.
The habitat assessment area should correspond to the area sampled for amphibians.
Several references describe 6.7 Resources for monitoring
methods of collecting habitat information (Heyer et al. 1994; Olsen et al. 1997).
We present one example of measuring biotic and abiotic habitat variables at a site (Appendix B).
The method is relatively simple and is based primarily on visual estimates of cover.
Habitat assessments should be done after surveys for amphibians to avoid disturbing amphibians before the survey.
Familiarity with aquatic vegetation is helpful (Fassett 1957; Borman et al. 1997; Chadde 1998), although we present estimates of cover by vegetative growth habit, not species or genera.
Cover information can be collected on the various types of vegetation (Appendix B).
Vegetation is broadly defined as determined by plant habit (i.e., submerged, emergent, terrestrial, etc.).
Information on substrate characteristics (sediment particle size estimates) can also be collected.
Canopy Cover Visual estimates can be made of tree cover directly overhead, including overhanging canopy from trees with trunks located outside of the survey area.
Canopy cover is estimated for woody vegetation 
Because forest canopies often consist of multiple layers, we estimate total canopy cover and canopy cover above a height of 5 m (upper canopy).
The estimate of upper canopy coverage may equal, but should not exceed the total canopy coverage.
Aquatic Habitat Cover
Vegetation Cover We also estimated vegetation cover for the entire sampling area, including submerged, floatingÂ­leaved (both rooted and nonrooted), emergent, woody/shrub (
Because water levels may vary and aquatic plants may be found on dry substrates, plant categories can be determined according to growth preferences and not on hydrologic conditions present at the time of the assessment.
The coverage of dormant woody vegetation can also be recorded.
Litter, Log, and Rock Cover We estimated the coverage of dead leaf and plant litter, downed log, and rock cover for the entire sampling area of both aquatic and terrestrial portions of the site combined.
Water Depth Because water depth usually varies across a sampling area, we suggest estimating water depth at five points randomly placed within the survey area.
A measuring pole can be constructed from a PVC pipe.
When measuring water depth, avoid resting the bottom of the measuring pole on submerged vegetation or large woody debris.
If the water depth is greater than can be measured, record "Greater than" the maximum measurable depth.
Substrate Characterization
We estimated the total amount of aquatic habitat (habitat currently covered with water) contained within the sampling area.
Underwater substrates can be characterized by particle size and organic content.
Substrate type can be examined by sight and feel at the same five points used to determine average 6.8 Resources for monitoring
water depth.
Only a small quantity (~ 2 cm3) of substrate is needed for characterization and should be taken to a substrate depth of about 2 cm (Yin et al. 2000).
