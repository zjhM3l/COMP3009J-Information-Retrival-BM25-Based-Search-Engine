CHAPTER 1.
Introduction Major Changes Previous biennial Coordinated Prevention Grant (CPG) Guidelines have pointed out various incremental changes to the program, such as percentage match requirements, changes in eligibility, or changes in supplemental funding.
For the 2004-05 biennium, there are few changes in the framework of the program.
The allocation system remains the same, approximately the same amount of money is available, and there are no changes in who or what is eligible.
Nevertheless, the CPG program is responding to findings by the Joint Legislative Audit Review Committee (JLARC) by increasing strategic practices such as selecting projects for their likely results, structuring grant officer involvement towards technical assistance, and using project data to evaluate programs and improve future projects' efficiency and effectiveness.
The changes are a result of an audit of natural resource grant programs conducted by JLARC, which published its report, Investing In The Environment: Environmental Quality Grant 
This report criticized several grant programs, including CPG, for providing funding for activities and capital items without using selection and monitoring methods which would guarantee that the environment would be improved as a result.
The report resulted in the Legislature adopting House Bill (HB) 1785 and modification of the Model Toxics Control Act RCW 70.105D (which provides the funding mechanism for CPG) to require implementation of several of JLARC's recommendations.
The specific requirements of HB 1785 are to 1) identify environmental outcomes for each project, 2) to make award decisions based upon these outcomes, and 3) to work with affected stakeholders to implement these changes.
In the summer of 2002, Ecology began meeting with stakeholders to decide how JLARC recommendations would be incorporated into CPG, starting in the 2004-2005 grant cycle.
Ecology initially thought that HB 1785 required CPG to abandon the population-based allocation of funds and adopt a competitive application process.
JLARC guidance includes using a "minimum threshold score", above which applications would be funded, and below which they would not.
The workgroup decided that the population-based method of setting allocations should continue unchanged, in order to develop successful solid waste programs statewide.
Conversations with JLARC staff indicated this was acceptable provided Ecology had the ability to say "No" to poor investments and that statewide strategic goals were being met.
In response, several methods were identified to ensure rigor in the selection process, strengthening project proposals so that all projects can be good investments.
As a result, program operating methods in the upcoming biennium will be a combination of JLARC recommendations and past program practices.
`Summit' meetings with state and local governments will help coordinate statewide priorities, and performance measures will track our progress.
Selection When reviewing 2004-2005 CPG applications, grant officers will examine applications for: 1.
Identified environmental and health benefits; 2.
Identified measurement method (what will be measured and how);
1
3.
Appropriateness of method/technology (applications identify the methodology and rationale for use); 4.
Cost effectiveness compared to similar projects in similar jurisdictions (using performance benchmarks); 5.
Readiness to proceed; 6.
Minimum threshold score, defined so that each project is the best it possibly can be (see below) and, 7.
Consistency with local comprehensive solid waste and hazardous waste management plans, ensuring that all projects address identified strategic priorities.
For the 2004-05 Cycle, each project must satisfy each of the above criteria.
The minimum threshold is that a project must be the best that can be done with the time and resources of the recipient and Ecology, taking political, economic and technical feasibility into account.
The project officers will work with the recipients to come to an agreement as to what that might be in specific cases.
Negotiation will ensure that projects adopt the most effective known methods.
JLARC stated at a December 2002 meeting that Ecology must have the ability to say, "No", to projects, if they do not seem to be good investments yielding environmental benefits.
Ecology can refuse to fund projects on these grounds; however, Ecology's goal is to get to "Yes" on projects.
Implementation New attention will be directed towards internal grant timelines.
Project implementation and expenditure plans and schedules specified in the grant agreements will be monitored, with an emphasis on timely support.
Grants will include an Implementation Schedule, which identifies the key check-in points for each project.
Grant officers will call or visit recipients at these key points, to learn whether milestones have been met and how projects are proceeding.
If projects are behind schedule, or milestone targets have not been met, the recipient and grant officer will develop a plan to get back on track.
This approach promotes a focus on solutions and successes, stressing direct personal contact.
Monitoring Output and outcome data will be collected, with either anticipated or actual outcome data used as a baseline or benchmark to evaluate project effectiveness.
CPG already collects a mixture of output and outcome measures.
(Outputs are the activities we do: the number of collection events, workshops, or inspections, etc., while outcomes are the desired health or environmental results: for example, pounds of household hazardous waste (HHW) collected, behavior changes leading to more recycling, or uncontaminated groundwater.)
Each project will need to have identified environmental results (outcome measures), and/or an established link between an output and its associated outcome.
Adaptive Management and Systemic Issues One of JLARC's main points was to promote improved performance of grant-funded projects through `adaptive management.'
This is the use of what we learned from past efforts, or other jurisdictions' projects, to make the next round of projects more efficient or effective.
For this reason, the grant program will compile and publish output and outcome measures which directly relate to the program's investments (program level results).
This will enable internal and external review of
2
program performance related to investment results and effectiveness.
This will be completed through the Solid Waste Annual Report and a special CPG Report at the conclusion of each two year grant cycle.
The grant program will also regularly consult with an external advisory group regarding program practices and performance.
This will enable an objective evaluation of practices and their results, facilitating program responsiveness to changing conditions.
Ecology will convene with local government recipients every two years to review effectiveness data, monitor progress towards statewide goals, learn about and from each other's programs, improve coordination, and set strategic priorities for the next two years.
These meetings, which are initially being conceived of as two-day `summits,' would involve representatives from all planning jurisdictions as well as Ecology staff.
A main purpose would be to review CPG program goals and reach consensus on any needed changes, which would then be included in the next set of CPG Guidelines.
Communication and Reporting The communication systems will change by having more personal contact and a reporting system that requires fewer reports of more detail, and eliminates duplicative reporting.
Progress reports must still be submitted with each invoice, but have been simplified, leaving the bulk of reporting on results to one of the Annual Report forms or to the Final Performance Analysis.
One Annual Report form is an inventory of programs.
There is also a new Annual Report form for Public Information and Education programs.
Annual results data will be incorporated into the statewide Solid Waste Annual Report, and will not be focused on CPG per se.
Reports will no longer distinguish between CPGfunded moderate risk waste (MRW) and other MRW, but there needs to be enough expenditure data to document the role of CPG funding in the statewide solid waste systems.
The Final Performance Analysis or biennial report will review grant projects (and for larger jurisdictions, some non-grant projects) with an eye to costs, results, implementation challenges and potential improvements.
This information will serve to develop performance standards and identify best practices.
"Unchanged" Features of Coordinated Prevention Grants Reliance on Local Planning Process Washington State requires local governments to plan how they will manage both hazardous and solid waste.
The Coordinated Prevention Grant Program is designed to help local governments pay for updating local plans, and to put into action the projects identified in those plans.
In most of Washington State, county governments bear the responsibility for planning and implementing solid and hazardous waste management.
Therefore, the Coordinated Prevention Grant Program focuses on local solid waste planning authorities and jurisdictional health authorities as the lead agencies for coordinating and submitting grant applications.
Formula-Based Grant Funding Allocations are based on Chapter 173-312-080 WAC.
Formula-based funding has two premises: 1) Hazardous and solid waste problems are closely related to population levels 2) There is a minimum amount necessary to operate a program
3
CPG funding is split with 20% dedicated to Solid Waste Enforcement (SWE).
Enforcement dollars are spread equally among health authorities, with multi-county districts eligible to receive 50% more per jurisdiction than single county authorities.
The other 80% of funding goes to Solid 
There is an $80,000 base for each solid waste planning jurisdiction, with remaining funds spread on a per capita basis.
The formula funding is not an entitlement program.
Local governments must submit satisfactory applications that meet eligibility requirements and priorities identified in their approved solid and hazardous waste management plans, and provide the required match.
In addition, projects must meet the minimum threshold as defined by JLARC.
Match Percentage State funding will be supplied at a state share of 75%, with the local government providing 25% match.
This will apply to all CPG recipients.
Supplemental Funding Supplemental funding will be awarded at the same time as the original grant.
Requests for supplemental funding must be included in the original grant application.
If applicants desire supplemental funding, after detailing what will be done with the regular allocation they should specify the additional amount desired and what any additional funds would be used for.
See Chapter 3 for additional details.
Reporting Requirements Administrative Requirements for Ecology Grants and Loans, revised October 2000 (WDOE 91-18, the "Yellow Book") allow a reporting schedule other than quarterly.
Each recipient will work with their respective grant officer during the application process to establish reporting requirements for their grant.
Requirements may be based on reliable/accurate reporting history, a recipient's fiscal ability to go without frequent reimbursements, or other negotiated factors.
In addition to progress reports, which can be negotiated to be due from monthly to annually, recipients are also required to submit annual reports and a Final Project Analysis at the grants conclusion.

CHAPTER 2.
Eligibility and Project Selection Eligible Governments Jurisdictions Responsible to Implement Plans Local governments with current Ecology-approved local waste management plans (planning authority) are eligible to apply directly for Solid and Hazardous Waste funds to help implement the activities identified in those plans.
Local governments without current Ecology-approved local waste management plans are eligible to apply directly for Solid and Hazardous Waste funds if updating the plans to current status is included as a task.
Planning authorities may also apply for Solid Waste Enforcement (SWE) funds if they are dedicated as lead agencies for those activities (see Jurisdictional Health Authorities (JHA's) below).
Eligible Cities Cities are eligible to apply directly for Solid and Hazardous Waste funds if they are an independent planning authority under Chapter 70.95 RCW.
These cities are eligible for a share of their county's funding allocation, in proportion to their share of the county population.
The city's share may be increased if Ecology, the county, and other grant-eligible entities in the county agree.
Jurisdictional Health Authorities (JHAs) Local jurisdictional health authorities are eligible to apply directly for Solid Waste Enforcement funds.
Their eligibility applies whether the county planning authority has fulfilled its planning requirements or not.
Following the adoption of Chapter 173-350 WAC (the revision of Chapter 173304 WAC), funding will be dependent on the jurisdiction adopting a solid waste ordinance within one year from the state adoption, which occurred April 10, 2003.
The rationale for this requirement is that, according to Ecology's legal counsel, without local adoption of 173-350 a JHA has little or no legal basis for its SWE authority.
JHAs may also apply for Solid and Hazardous Waste funds if designated as lead agencies for Solid and Hazardous Waste activities.
See page 20 for JHA allocation information.
Cities in County Plans Generally, cities have authorized the county planning authority to prepare a plan for the respective city's hazardous/moderate risk and solid waste management as part of the comprehensive county plan.
Cities without independent plans may receive funding for projects, but they may not apply directly.
They must channel their request through the planning authority.
Counties, in turn, have the responsibility to notify the cities included in their comprehensive plans of the availability of grant funds, and to solicit the cities' recommendations for projects.
All projects must be consistent with the local hazardous or solid waste management plans.
Counties may elect to assign a portion of their allocation directly to a city and let the city negotiate a formal agreement with Ecology.
Cities covered in county plans are eligible for a share of their county planning authority's funding allocation, in proportion to their share of the total county population.
This relieves the county from the responsibility for administering the funds, but it also ends the county's role in managing the use of the funds.
5
NonÂ­Eligible Entities No special district, tribe, school, university, or government agency (other than those listed above) is eligible to apply directly for Coordinated Prevention Grants.
Private businesses and citizen groups cannot receive Coordinated Prevention Grant funds.
Eligible entities, however, may use grant funds to contract with private businesses or non-profits to implement their projects.
(See Administrative Requirements for Ecology Grants and Loans, WDOE 91-18, revised October 2000, Part V, Contracts, Property, and Records.)
Eligible Projects Coordinated Prevention Grants can pay for projects and programs that: Â· Conform to a current, approved local hazardous/moderate risk waste management plan (as required by the state's Hazardous Waste Management law, Chapter 70.105 RCW); or a current, approved local comprehensive solid waste management plan (as required by the state's Solid Waste Management--Reduction and Recycling law, Chapter 70.95 RCW); or approved amendments to these plans.
Comply with all applicable local, state, and federal ordinances, laws, and regulations, including state and local permitting requirements and State Environmental Policy Act requirements.
Are consistent with the policies of these grant guidelines.
Are consistent with Ecology's Administrative Requirements for Ecology Grants and Loans revised October 2000 (WDOE 91-18, the "Yellow Book").
Â·
Â· Â·
In order to receive funding, projects must meet certain criteria established by the Joint Legislative Audit Review Committee (JLARC) and incorporated into the Coordinated Prevention Grant program for the 2004-2005 funding cycle.
Please see Chapter 3 (Applying for a Grant) for details of JLARC criteria.
Coordinated Prevention Grants will pay for costs of eligible projects and programs.
Grant funds may be used only to reimburse documented expenditures for eligible costs.
Costs must be incurred as an expense before recipients can be reimbursed for it.
Incurring a cost is either paying for something or being obligated to pay for it by receiving a bill or invoice.
Costs for goods and services must be direct costs.
They must be identified with a specific objective of the project.
Examples include compensation of employees for the time devoted to a project, cost of materials and approved capital expenditures used specifically for the project, and costs of services furnished for the project by other entities.
Documentation of these costs must be available upon request.
Overhead Overhead costs are indirect costs incurred by the grant recipient for a common purpose.
They are not readily identifiable with a particular objective.
Recipients are reimbursed for these costs at a rate of 25 percent of salaries and benefits (excluding overtime differential) for time devoted specifically to the project.
Examples of overhead costs include the prorated cost of utilities at a multipurpose facility used for grant and non-grant activities, costs of maintaining a department that provides 6
services to projects other than those specified in the grant (e.g., a warehouse or mailroom), and the costs of supervisory personnel.
In addition, reimbursements to another government entity for any portion of that other entity's contributions are eligible.
Administration and Staff Salaries and benefits of employees working on a project funded by the grant must be correctly documented.
Salaries and benefits eligible for grant funding are limited to actual staff hours worked on Coordinated Prevention Grant projects.
Overtime differential is allowed only if 100% of regular time is spent on grant projects.
Staff hours spent on these activities must be separated from time spent on non-grant activities on time sheets.
(The State Auditor has consistently ruled that signed time sheets must be available.)
Salaries and benefits may not be prorated, based on a percentage of time, or based on any other formula.
Other Eligible Costs: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Travel (costs cannot exceed those allowed by state travel regulations) Training for local government staff Consultant and engineering services Public involvement and education activities Printing and mailing Equipment and supplies Facility construction Project management and administration
Refreshments Refreshments and lunches will be eligible for grant recipient employees and volunteers at household hazardous waste and special collection events when providing food on site is necessary to ensure that service to clients is not disrupted.
Eligibility of food costs must be stated clearly in the grant agreement and the reimbursable amount may not exceed the limits set by the Office of Financial Management for state employees.
Computers Computer costs directly related to CPG activities are eligible.
However, recipients must have prior authorization from their grant officer before buying computers and related software.
Operational Costs Operational costs for recycling and MRW activities are eligible.
Overtime differential pay will be eligible if 100% of the employee's time is spent on grant funded projects.
After reading this chapter, applicants can call their grant officer if there are questions about what can be covered by the grant.
Please refer to the Yellow Book for a complete list of eligible, ineligible, and conditionally eligible costs, (also referred to in the Yellow Book as allowable and unallowable costs).
Ineligible Costs Ineligible costs, programs, projects, and activities include, but are not limited to:
7
Â· Â· Â· Â·
Â· Â· Â·
Administration not directly related to execution of tasks in a grant project, except for allowable overhead.
Landfill closures, except emergency work at landfills closed under Chapter 173-304 WAC.
New landfill construction, landfill expansion, or landfill upgrading.
Solid waste collection, processing and disposal costs, including equipment, transfer stations, operational costs, and solid waste collection events, except for disposal costs incidental to recycling operations.
Equipment for commercial establishments.
Solid waste incinerator feasibility studies, construction plans, construction, and maintenance or operation.
Projects that are primarily public works projects, such as buying asphalt mill trenchers (situations may vary; check with the local grant officer).
Eligible Categories There are three general categories that all eligible projects are assigned: 1.
Moderate Risk Waste (MRW) 2.
Waste Reduction and Recycling (WRR) 3.
Solid Waste Enforcement (SWE) Each of the three categories is explained below.
Moderate Risk Waste Plan Development and Updating.
The state's Hazardous Waste Management law requires local governments to prepare a local hazardous/moderate risk waste management plan to manage the moderate risk waste generated within the jurisdiction (Chapter 70.105.220 RCW).
All jurisdictions have complied with this law.
Plan updates are not required for local hazardous waste/moderate risk waste plans, but Ecology strongly encourages local governments to periodically review their plans and update them as necessary.
Plan updates must show dual funding mechanisms for systems contained in the plan, with and without grant support.
Local hazardous/moderate risk waste management plans and revisions should conform to Ecology's Planning Guidelines for Local Hazardous Waste Plans (WDOE 93-99, August 1994).
Ecology's Implementation Guidelines for Local Hazardous Waste Plans (WDOE 92-14, July 1992) defines program implementation and sets the criteria for evaluating local government efforts to carry out the plans.
8
Plan Implementation.
Implementation activities established by the approved local hazardous waste management plan include, but are not limited to: Hazardous Waste Health and Safety Â· Preparing moderate risk waste emergency response plans.
Â· Training in handling moderate risk waste (training for contracted employees is not eligible).
Household Hazardous Waste Education and Compliance.
This covers activities to inform and educate the public in order to reach the goals of the hazardous waste management plan.
These activities may include, but are not limited to: Â· Resource centers and hotlines Â· Publicity Â· Printed and audio-visual materials Â· Product labeling Â· School programs Â· Developing ordinances and regulations Â· Implementing ordinances and regulations Â· Pesticide reduction programs Â· Mercury removal programs Â· Sustainable energy alternatives Household Hazardous Waste Collection and Disposal.
The collection and disposal of hazardous/moderate risk wastes brought in from residential households is eligible for the grant-funded activities below.
Small quantity generator (SQG) wastes are addressed in a following section.
Collection Events.
Operating expenses at one-day or multiple-day events to collect hazardous substances from households are eligible.
These events can be held at one site or at several sites.
Some are "tailgate" events where the collection facility is moved around to several sites in one day.
Collection events can include materials exchange and recycling among those attending.
Fixed Facilities.
Operating expenses at facilities, including satellite facilities, offering collection and disposal services year-round at a fixed site, are also eligible.
Generally, all costs associated with operating MRW facilities are considered to be eligible as direct costs.
Therefore overhead costs will not exist, except when associated with multi-purpose facilities.
Mobile Facilities.
Operating expenses at facilities offering collection and disposal services that can be moved from site to site are eligible.
9
Uncontaminated Used Oil and Latex Paint.
Grant funding will not cover the costs of disposing of uncontaminated used oil and useable latex paint at a landfill.
This restriction applies whether the oil and paint are contained in lab packs or not.
Recycling, re-refining, reuse and energy recovery costs, including transportation, for these materials remain eligible for grant funding.
Used oil burners are eligible only if recycling or re-refining are not economically feasible or reasonably available.
Contaminated Used Oil.
The costs of disposing of contaminated used oil collected at fixed and mobile facilities and collection events are an eligible expense.
Out-of-state Waste.
Grant funding will cover the costs of dealing with waste from only Washington residents at fixed and mobile facilities and collection events.
It will not cover the costs of waste from out of state.
Capital.
All capital costs associated with household hazardous waste collection and disposal projects are eligible.
Additional capital needed for the collection of SQG waste is eligible as long as it is done in conjunction with the collection of household hazardous waste.
Small Quantity Generator Implementation.
Activities that inform and educate businesses in support of the goals in the hazardous waste management plan include, but are not limited to such projects as: Â· Resource libraries Â· Waste consultation services to help businesses find ways to generate less hazardous waste and to recycle more Â· Award/incentive programs to promote better business practices Â· Guidelines and other materials on waste reduction, waste reuse and recycling, and materials exchange Â· Seminars, workshops and information exchanges Â· Education about ordinances, regulations, and compliance requirements Â· Regulatory action including , but not limited to, developing and revising ordinances, and implementing ordinances and regulations Â· Collection assistance Â· Collection of targeted wastes through fixed or mobile facilities, or at hazardous waste collection events, is eligible.
(Disposal costs for small quantity generator wastes are not grant eligible.)
Â· Toxicity Reduction Programs (non-toxic cleaners, IPM, mercury thermometer exchanges) Â· Small Business MRW Reduction technical assistance--on-site waste audits 10
Waste Reduction and Recycling (WRR) Constructing Facilities.
The main purpose of the facility must be to store, sort, process, or compost recyclables.
Construction can involve tasks such as: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Planning and feasibility studies.
(Note: Eligibility will be decided on a case-by-case basis.)
SEPA compliance/environmental impact statements Permitting costs Operation and maintenance plans Preparation of design documents Site acquisition Facility construction Equipment Used to Store, Sort, Process, or Compost Recyclables This includes equipment such as: Balers, compactors, glass crushers, chippers, tub grinders and forklifts Drop boxes and containers Residential compost bins Rolling stock for the exclusive collection of recyclables Mixed Use Equipment (Municipal Solid Waste and Recyclables) Scales to weigh wastes are eligible only if they are used primarily for weighing recyclables.
Collection trucks are grant eligible on a prorated basis.
Only the capital costs associated with collecting recyclables (not solid waste) are eligible.
Public Education and Involvement.
Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· This includes but is not limited to activities such as: Presentations and workshops.
Training.
School programs and award programs.
Resource centers and recycling hotlines.
Development and distribution of educational and informational materials.
Technical assistance or on-site visits to businesses and individuals.
Program Development.
Costs are eligible when associated with the administrative aspects of designing and developing a recycling infrastructure, evaluating program effectiveness, and promoting a program through public service announcements or brochures.
11
Market Development.
Market development includes activities to enhance markets for products containing recycled materials, such as "Buy Recycled" programs or local procurement programs.
Sustainable market development projects, such as sustainable building or sustainable energy/fuel sources are also eligible and encouraged.
Special Collection Events.
With the exception of solid waste disposal costs, all costs associated with recyclable collection events are eligible.
If moderate risk wastes are to be collected in conjunction with a recyclable collection event, operational costs and disposal costs of the moderate risk wastes are eligible.
Demonstration Projects.
Eligibility determined on a case-by-case basis.
Facility Operational Expenses.
Operational costs associated with recycling facilities are grant eligible.
Examples of operational costs include, but are not limited to: Â· Â· Â· Salaries/benefits of staff that collect, sort, process and/or transport recyclables.
Other costs associated with collecting, sorting processing and/or transporting recyclables including maintenance, fuel, supplies, administration, and overhead.
Costs associated with regulatory compliance, such as water sampling and laboratory tests at compost facilities.
Solid Waste Plan Development, Evaluation and Updates.
The state's Solid Waste Management law requires local governments to prepare a local comprehensive solid waste management plan to manage the solid waste generated within the jurisdiction (Chapter 70.95.090 RCW).
Local governments are required to review their local comprehensive solid waste management plans every five years and update them as necessary.
This is evaluating the plan to determine how well projects meet the objectives of the plan and if any plan revisions are necessary.
Grant funding for updates will be limited to those elements in the plan needing revision.
Plan updates must show alternative funding mechanisms for systems contained in the plan, with or without grant support.
Local comprehensive solid waste management plans and revisions must contain the elements required by Chapter 70.95 RCW. Ecology has developed Guidelines for the Development of Local Solid Waste Management Plans and Plan Revisions (WDOE 99-502, July 1999) to assist jurisdictions in the development of these plans.
Solid waste plans must also follow the Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission's Cost Assessment Guidelines (UTC228-90-1, January 1997), and conform with updated versions of appropriate rules, regulations, or guidelines including Chapter 173-350 WAC.
12
Solid Waste Enforcement Programs (SWE) Solid waste enforcement programs include, but are not limited to: Â· Ordinance Development and Review--Developing, reviewing and revising local guidelines, codes, ordinances, and regulations dealing with solid waste management and disposal.
Eligibility for grants will be contingent upon a jurisdiction having an ordinance within one year following the adoption of Chapter 173-350 WAC, which was adopted on February 10, 2003.
Â· Inspections--This includes solid waste enforcement agencies inspecting permitted solid waste sites and facilities such as landfills, transfer stations, drop boxes, recycling centers, etc., and loads coming into the sites and facilities.
Â· Inspections may also cover limited sample collection at a facility or site if deemed necessary to verify an owner or operator's monitoring results.
Grant funds cannot be used by a jurisdictional health district/department to conduct monitoring activities on behalf of an owner or operator of a solid waste site or facility.
Â· Enforcement--Investigating solid waste violations (such as illegal dumping), responding to complaints (including biosolids/septage), and correcting violations of solid waste laws.

Sustainability Projects Related to CPG For all three eligibility categories, Ecology encourages sustainability projects.
At its most basic level, sustainable means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
There eight principles to provide a framework toward sustainable solutions.
They are intended to serve as overarching themes.
They should not be viewed in isolation but as interdependent to one another.
1.
There is an interdependence between ecological, economic and social factors in achieving sustainability.
2.
The concept of waste can and should be eliminated.
3.
Healthy natural systems are the basis for sustainable communities and economies.
4.
Future generations should be equal partners in decision making.
5.
Local decisions have regional and global implications.
6.
Incentives are necessary to create sustainable behavior.
7.
Investment in the design phase of a process or product drives sustainable outcomes.
8.
Human relationships and a collaborative approach lead to sustainable solutions.
Ecology is looking for more sustainable projects and programs in 2004-2005 CPG applications.
Specifically, Ecology is looking for projects that cover three areas: Efficiency Improvement, Emerging Issues and Infrastructure Development.
Efficiency Improvement would be a different approach to an existing problem that accomplishes the same result using fewer resources or less time.
Ecology is also looking for projects that cover emerging issues such as electronic waste recycling, food waste collection and composting, green building programs and toxicity reduction.
Ecology recognizes that many counties have existing systems in place for the collection, recycling and processing of various solid and moderate risk wastes.
Further development and expansion of this existing infrastructure for rural counties is an important priority.
Please refer to Chapter 3 for a more in-depth explanation.

CHAPTER 3: Applying for a Grant Information Needed to Apply Sources and Cycles Coordinated Prevention Grants operate on a two-year cycle.
For the 2004-2005 funding cycle, grants begin on January 1, 2004 and expire on December 31, 2005.
Funding for Coordinated Prevention Grants comes from the Local Toxics Control Account (LTCA); a tax on first possession of hazardous substances in the state.
Availability and amount of funding depends upon legislative appropriations to the Account.
Both regular and supplemental applications are accepted from July 1 to September 30, 2003.
Supplemental awards will be announced in mid-November 2003.
All grants must be executed (signed by both the recipient and Ecology) by April 1, 2004.
2004-2005 CPG Cycle Calendar July 1, 2003 July 1 through September 30, 2003 Mid-November 2003 October 1 through December 31, 2003 January 1, 2004 April 1, 2004 Progress Reports Due January 30, 2005 January 30, 2006 December 31, 2005 February 15, 2006 Guidelines and application forms sent to local governments Â­ hard copy, electronically, and posted on Ecology's website.
Application period.
Both regular and supplemental applications are due to Ecology no later than September 30.
Supplemental awards announced.
Grants negotiated and written Grant starting date Grants must be executed by this date or funding may be revoked with funds going to supplemental projects? Due dates vary based on negotiated reporting terms in each agreement.
Reports are due 30 days after a respective billing(?) period ends Annual Reports due Grant expiration date Final Performance Analysis due
Local Cash Match Consistent with WAC 173-312-090 eligible project costs will be funded at a level of seventy-five percent for all recipients awarded a Coordinated Prevention Grant.
Twenty-five percent of eligible costs must be provided as local cash match.
Local cash match may be met by cash expenditures and interlocal costs.
Allowable sources of match include: local general tax revenues, solid waste fees, loans, federal grant funds, and project income (when expressly permitted within a grant agreement).
Interlocal costs are the only type of in-kind contributions that may be used for local cash match.
Interlocal costs are contributions made to a project by another local government pursuant to a valid written agreement between a grant recipient and the other government.
No other in-kind contributions may be used as match.
15
Available Grant Dollars for 2004 Â­ 2005 There is a total of $17,820,000 available for Coordinated Prevention Grants in the 2004-2005 funding cycle.
Allocation determinations are set by WAC 173-312-080.
Projected revenues to LTCA available each biennium for CPG purposes must be divided into two portions, one for solid waste enforcement grants, and one for solid and hazardous waste implementation grants.
Allocations are calculated as follows: Â· Â· For solid waste enforcement grants, twenty percent of the total CPG allocation.
Multi-county health jurisdictions will receive 50% more funding than single-county health jurisdictions.
For solid and hazardous waste implementation grants, the remaining eighty percent is divided among counties by means of a formula that consists of two elements (referred to as base-plus funding): 1) 2) A fixed amount (base) for each county A per capita amount based on county population size
Counties that submit a coordinated application for solid and hazardous waste implementation projects shall receive a ten percent increase in base plus level funding as an incentive as specified in WAC 173-312-080(3)(c).
Regular Funding Requests Solid Waste Enforcement Projects The total allocation for Solid waste enforcement is $3,564,000.
Therefore, each single-county jurisdictional health department may apply for $99,000 and each multi-county jurisdictional health department may apply for $148,500.
If jurisdictions cannot utilize all of their allocation they should apply for a lesser amount; or if there is a history of spending less than the amount available, Ecology may contact the recipient to negotiate a lesser grant award.
Solid waste enforcement funds not applied for will be redistributed as supplemental funding.
Solid and Hazardous Waste Implementation Projects The total allocation for solid and hazardous waste implementation projects is $14,256,000.
The base amount per county is $80,000.
The per capita amount is $1.62868.
By county populations are based on Washington Office of Financial Management population forecasts as of July 1, 2002.
Please refer to Table 3-1 for solid and hazardous waste implementation awards by county.
Note that Table 3-1 includes each county's ten percent incentive.
Should a county fail to submit a coordinated application, their ten percent incentive will be revoked and the monies transferred into supplemental funding.
As with solid waste enforcement projects, if jurisdictions eligible for solid and hazardous waste implementation grants cannot utilize all of their allocation they should apply for a lesser amount; or if there is a history of spending less than the amount available, Ecology may contact the recipient to negotiate a lesser grant award.
Solid and hazardous waste implementation funds not applied for will be redistributed as supplemental funding.

Supplemental Funding Requests Some applicants will be unable to use the entire grant allocation available to them.
The funds that do not get awarded will be made available to other grant recipients as supplemental awards.
Supplemental applications are due at the same time as regular applications.
Supplemental applications received after September 30 will not be considered for funding.
Successful supplemental requests will be written into a grant agreement concurrent with regular funding requests.
Priority for supplemental funding will be for projects that meet strategic needs or address key issues, with additional interest in projects that have benefits that extend beyond the project sponsor.
For the purpose of supplemental funding, Ecology will consider three types of strategic projects: Â· Â· Â· Efficiency Improvement Â­ better solution to old problem(s), also called "innovation" Emerging Issues Â­ solution to new problem(s) Infrastructure Development Â­ especially for a capital projects in small jurisdictions that do not fit within regular base plus funds.
Key issues for 2004-2005 CPG are: Â· Reduce generation and use of toxic materials and wastes Â· Minimize the amount of waste that gets landfilled or incinerated Â· Reduce the impact of toxins on the environment Â· Reduce health impacts from solid and hazardous wastes Â· Encourage more environmentally sound waste management practices by citizens Â· Electronic waste recycling Â· Food waste collection/composting Please contact Ecology's regional grant officer for additional information regarding key issues and strategic projects.
Ecology and local governments will meet every two years to discuss statewide priorities and appropriate key issues for future CPG cycles.
Key issues for 2004-2005 were established by the CPG revision group that met from August 2002 through January 2003.
As specified in 173-312-080(3)(d), available supplemental funds will remain within their funding category; solid waste enforcement funds will remain for solid waste enforcement activities, and solid and hazardous waste supplemental funds will remain for solid and hazardous waste implementation project activities.
If funding for either category exceeds supplemental requests, remaining funds will be made available for the other grant category.
Application Process Application Coordination Note: This section (Application Coordination) does not apply to health districts or health departments applying for Solid Waste Enforcement grants.
A coordinated application is a single application that serves the county and other local governments within the county.
Only local governments with authority and responsibility for developing and implementing local hazardous waste and solid waste plans (planning authorities) are eligible to apply for grants.
Applicants need to ensure that all local jurisdictions within the 18
county have an opportunity to be a part of the grant process.
Applicants need to decide which jurisdictions will receive a grant(s).
Cities listed in the plan, special districts, councils of governments, and other governments have a right to ask for funding and are eligible to receive funding, but they must apply through their respective county.
In addition, jurisdictional health authorities that have responsibility for solid waste programs may have their own grant.
Grants that may be awarded to eligible cities may not exceed a city's proportionate share, based on population, of a county's base plus funding level unless Ecology, the county, and other grant-eligible entities agree otherwise.
To ensure the intent of Chapter WAC 173-312-060, counties must submit a single coordinated application; otherwise their 10% increase of allocation incentive will be transferred to the supplemental fund pool.
Applicants are required to include documentation that all jurisdictions within their counties that signed on to the approved plan have been notified within a reasonable time, and that the jurisdictions have had the opportunity to request that their projects be included in the coordinated application.
This effort in coordination assures that the applicant retains the 10% grant allocation incentive.
Documentation could be a copy of a letter notifying the jurisdictions of the availability of grant funds, an offer to consider requests for project funding, and a list of who received the letter.
If a jurisdiction challenges an application, asserting that they did not have the opportunity for input, the application will be delayed until the applicant has shown they have fairly considered the jurisdiction's request.
Writing a Grant Application In order to ensure that grants are written and negotiated in a timely manner, please be sure to complete all necessary portions of the grant application for both regular and (as applicable) supplemental projects.
Sample applications are appended; please refer to them as a guide in completing your application or contact your Ecology regional grant officer (see table 3-2).
You are also encouraged to set-up a pre-application meeting with your Ecology regional grant officer to go over questions and comments you may have about completing your application or other items related to the CPG program.
JLARC identifies several investment practices to consider in selecting projects for funding.
These practices are important to take into account in developing grant proposals.
Key selection investment practices identified by JLARC include: evaluating the expected environmental quality benefits; evaluating the likelihood benefits will be produced; evaluating costs relative to benefits; evaluating a project's readiness to proceed; and, employment of a minimum threshold score to receive funding.
Recipients should craft their applications with these practices in mind.
In order to ensure consistency with JLARC selection investment practices, the CPG revision group proposed that Ecology's regional grant officers review applications for: Identified environmental or health benefits Identified measurement method (what will be measured and how) Appropriateness of method/technology (applications identify the methodology and rationale for use) Cost effectiveness compared to similar projects in similar jurisdictions (using performance benchmarks) Readiness to proceed
19
Minimum threshold score Consistency with local comprehensive solid waste and hazardous waste management plans, ensuring that all projects address identified strategic priorities The minimum threshold score for 2004-2005 is that projects must be the best that can be done with the time and resources of the recipient taking political, economic, and technical feasibility into account.
In addition to the above selection investment practices, supplemental applications must: Use adaptive management to address key issues on projects that intend to create a tool with wider benefit
Establishing Targets For applications and project results to be comparable, Ecology and local governments will need to establish standard performance units over time.
Here is a list of possible units to help applicants think about what kinds of desired results: Identifiable environmental results: Â· Diversion of wastes, measured by weight or volume, for reuse or recycling Â· Avoided use of resources (water, energy, construction materials...), by weight or volume Participation: Â· Volunteer hours Â· Usage or participation rate of public services (collection events, curbside recycling...)
Â· Number of business process changes Education: Â· Public awareness Â· Attitude shift Â· Behavioral changes Solid Waste Enforcement Â· Illegal dump resolution rate Â· Illegal dump generation rate Â· Number of permits reviewed Â· Number of inspections Â· Ground water quality data Although a particular project may have a goal that is a percentage change, all projects will need to preserve the raw numbers behind the percentage, so that unit costs can be calculated and effectiveness rates compared.
How and When to Use Milestones or Target Plans Milestones and Target Plans should be used to ensure project success and timeliness by building planning and program logic into the project.
They should be used for the following types of projects: Â· Â· Â· Complex (multi-phased) projects that are sequential in nature Behavior change projects (finding and training volunteers, e.g.) New projects that require special oversight
20
As an example, say the project is distribution of mulching mowers: The Goal is to reduce the amount of waste going to the local compost facility.
Mulching mowers do this by reintroducing cut grass on site as mulch, thereby not producing a waste that needs to be managed or disposed.
The Target is a specific amount of progress to make, for instance, a certain weight or volume of grass clippings diverted.
If weight or volume cannot be easily measured, mower usage rates and assumptions about grass growth rates can be combined to estimate weights or volumes.
The following chart shows a hypothetical applicant's Milestones that lead towards the above Target.
The chart also shows target dates and verification results.
Target Plan STEP A B C D E F MILESTONE Complete Plan Contract w/manufacturer Media announcements Distribution Event 300 mowers sold 95% usage / 20 tons/year diverted TARGET DATE May 01, 03 June 15, 03 June 15, 03 July 1-14, 03 July 15, 03 Oct. 15, 03 VERIFICATION NA, or completed, yes/no NA NA NA Attendance/Rebates used Survey/Results
The above example shows the selected Milestones and dates are well thought-out steps towards completion of the project.
The Verification documentations are evidence of each Milestone' success and can be used to generate feedback and evaluation.
Negotiating a Grant Agreement After receiving applications, an Ecology grant officer will review them for adequacy in meeting the criteria to receive funding.
Applications that have lower performance expectations result in negotiation.
The purpose of the negotiation is to ensure projects adopt the most effective known methods.
In meetings with Ecology, JLARC stated that Ecology must have the ability to say "no" to projects determined not to be good investments.
Ecology can refuse to fund projects on these grounds; however, Ecology's goal is to get to "yes" on projects.
For example, most programs might operate CRT collection for about $5 per tube.
An application for a program that operates at $10 a tube may get a call from the grant officer to explore the discrepancy.
It would be acceptable if the higher costs are the result of distance to market, costs of a certified contractor, or other similar structural hindrance.
Conversely, a program that operates at $10 a tube because the program is unwilling to bulk materials and insists on shipping daily would not be acceptable.
The goal is to use cost effectiveness data to identify operational best practices.
Grant officers then work with applicants to ensure that best practices are widely adopted, increasing overall efficiency and effectiveness.
If through the course of negotiation, it is determined that an application fails to meet all required criteria, and the applicant is unwilling to change the project scope of the application, an applicant does not automatically forfeit their funding; they will have an opportunity to apply the funds to a different project.
However, if an applicant applied for a project that failed to met all funding criteria and was unwilling to change the scope or apply the funds to a different project task, at that point Ecology's obligation under RCW 70.105D (amended by HB-1785 in the year 2001) would be to revoke available funding to that recipient.
As amended, 70.105D states that "in providing grants to local governments, the department shall require grant recipients to incorporate the environmental benefits of the project into their grant applications, and the 21
department shall utilize the statement of environmental benefits in its prioritization and selection process."
This funding would then be made available to all recipients as part of the supplemental funding pool.
Awards for supplemental funding will be determined no later than mid-November.
You are encouraged to work closely with your Ecology regional grant officer throughout the application and negotiation periods to ensure that grant projects meet the new funding criteria.
Drafting and Finalizing a Grant Agreement A crucial part of the grant agreement drafted by an Ecology regional grant officer is the implementation schedule.
The Implementation Schedule is a tool to monitor and assist the project.
It is comprised of process steps organized in a chronological order that, as accomplished, result in progress towards a target.
The target(s) are usually changes in behavior, that when reached results in an environmental and or health benefit.
Your regional grant officer will collaborate with you as needed in drafting a project's implementation schedule.
The payment and reporting schedules and other terms and conditions, as applicable, will also be worked out during the drafting of the agreement Once a draft has been routed through Ecology's various sections for review, a formal offer will be mailed to a recipient.
The offer needs to be signed by someone with authority to obligate local funds and sent back to the Ecology regional grant officer within 45 days.
At that point it is signed by Ecology and the formalized agreement returned to the local government.

CHAPTER 4: Monitoring the Grant There are four layers of monitoring in these grants.
(1): the Implementation Schedule that is part of the grant, (2): The Progress Reports that are attached to payment requests (invoices), (3): the Annual Report that includes broad performance measures, and (4): the Final Performance Analysis that is a required summary and evaluation for the grant.
Implementation Schedule The Implementation Schedule is a tool to monitor and assist the project's success.
It is comprised of Milestones, which are logical steps organized in chronological order that result in progress towards a Target.
The Targets are those identified "goals", usually changes in behavior, or an increase in waste prevented, reused or recycled, that when reached results in a successful project (see Target Plan in Chapter 3).Grant officers will develop implementation schedules while writing your grants.
The recipient has the responsibility to track the Milestones.
Ecology project officers need to track the implementation schedule.
He/She will contact the Recipient on (or near) the Target Dates to verify the Milestones are "on track".
The on-going check-ins and monitoring will ensure project progress and allow for changes and evaluation of problems at critical junctures.
The check-in points will be opportunities to verify, support, ensure progress, adapt or problemsolve, and strengthen relations.
They also diminish the need for detailed reporting that accompanies payment requests.
Grant officers will work with applicants to determine the most appropriate check-in points for the implementation schedule.
The Schedule for the mulching mower project, for instance, might include check-in points at Steps E and F only.
The implementation schedule is designed to facilitate meaningful and timely communication.
What is included will depend upon how much technical assistance is needed.
More challenging projects may have several check-in points, while some ongoing operations may have no milestones warranting a check-in.
Table 4.1 on the following page provides and example of an Implementation Schedule.
It identifies: Project/Steps, Targets, Target Dates, and a Status column to be verified by the Grant Project Officer.
Project 1 continues with the sample project of providing mulching mowers.

Progress Reports The Progress Reports are significantly simplified from previous grant cycles and no longer require specific data about project outputs or outcomes, though whether milestones scheduled during the reporting period have been met should be noted.
They include a brief description of activities conducted in the timeframe of the payment request.
Progress reports meet accounting and administrative requirements for processing invoices and must accompany each payment request.
Annual Report Each year, Ecology publishes an annual report titled Solid Waste in Washington State Annual Status Report.
This report compiles data on waste generation, recycling, and disposal.
These data represent the jurisdiction's overall solid waste system, whether funded by grants or not.
In this cycle, we will begin to incorporate CPG data into the annual report.
Requests for items already reported, such as MRW, will not be duplicated.
Areas that have not been included, such as education and solid waste enforcement, will be included, using the data reporting formats you have used in past cycles.
In addition, we will ask local governments to verify the types of solid waste programs offered in your jurisdictions, to create an index of programs statewide.
Annual reporting forms are found in Appendix C.
Final Performance Analysis The Final Performance Analysis is a summary for the grant period covering each project that is grant funded.
It should clearly show the outcomes of each project and an evaluation (successes and problem areas) of each.
A second part of the FPA is showing, in narrative form, specific, measurable environmental results associated with each project and the methods used to obtain those results.
These results will help identify best practices.
This is especially true with emerging and innovative projects.
Final performance analysis forms are in Appendix C?

APPENDIX A Glossary of Terms
25
26
Glossary of Terms Adaptive Management is an approach to policy making that acknowledges our inability to predict the future.
Its basic premise is that "studying the issue" can be overdone, wasting time and resources.
Instead, adaptive management relies on trying out the best ideas and measuring their success.
Performance data are then evaluated to inform further decisions and solutions.
Agreement means the formal written contractual arrangement, signed by the authorized official(s) of the recipient and Ecology, which details the terms of the grant or loan.
It includes, at a minimum, an approved scope of work, expected outcomes, total project costs, funding percentages, eligibility criteria, budget and performance schedule.
Allowable Costs are costs included in the categories of allowable costs detailed in Part II of the Administrative Requirements for Ecology Grants and Loans, WDOE 91-18.
Amendment means a written document, signed by the authorized official of Ecology, which details the changes or revisions to the original terms of the grant or loan.
There are two types of amendments allowed--letter and formal.
(See the Administrative Requirements for Ecology Grants and Loans, WDOE 91-18, for detailed information.)
Authorized Official is a person designated by the recipient or by Ecology to sign a grant or loan agreement and any formal amendments to it.
Benchmarks are performance standards, expressed in terms of a unit result per dollar cost, used to compare the accomplishments of similar jurisdictions to identify best practices and most effective methods.
For instance, with data on the outcomes and costs of several home composting, grasscycling or regional composting facility, innovation within categories can be discovered and shared.
Relative cost effectiveness of the various alternatives can also be evaluated.
Capital Costs means the costs of facilities, land, and equipment, and repairs that materially increase their value or useful life.
Cash Expenditure means any cash outlay by the recipient, regardless of the source of funds, for direct costs of goods and/or services, salaries, and benefits of recipient employees; overhead costs; and payments made to contractors.
Close-Out means the process by which all administrative matters relative to a grant are reconciled in order to close the file.
Contract means a written instrument whose principal purpose is the procurement--by purchase or leaseÂ­of goods or services for the direct benefit of the project.
Department means the Department of Ecology.
Disposal Costs means the costs to transport material and to treat it, recycle it, incinerate it, or place it in a landfill.
It does not include the costs to collect material and prepare it for disposal.
27
Disposal Site means the location where any final treatment, utilization, processing, or deposit of solid waste occurs.
Ecology Grant Officer/Project Manager means the Ecology staff person assigned to negotiate the terms of any agreement with the recipient and to manage the project.
Effective Date (of an agreement) means the earliest date on which eligible project costs may be incurred.
Unless otherwise stated in the agreement, the effective date is the date that the agreement was signed by Ecology.
Eligible Costs are costs that meet all eligibility criteria established in the terms of the grant agreement.
This includes any criteria related to the nature and the amount of the costs.
If a cash expenditure is eligible, this implies that it will be reimbursed, in whole or in part, with state funds.
If an in-kind contribution is eligible, a recipient may use it to meet the match requirement.
(See Interlocal Costs.)
Environmental Equity means the proportionate and equitable distribution of environmental benefits and risks among diverse economic and cultural communities.
It ensures that the policies, activities, and responses of government entities do not differently impact diverse social and economic groups.
Environmental equity promotes a safe and healthy environment for all people.
Grant means an award of money or property to accomplish a public purpose authorized by statute.
The term does not include technical assistance, which provides services instead of money, or other assistance such as revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations.
Nor does the term include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum, for which the recipient is not required to account.
(NOTE: This should not be confused with technical assistance grants, which are awards of money to accomplish technical assistance.)
Hazardous Waste means and includes all dangerous and extremely hazardous waste.
This term includes moderate risk waste (see Moderate Risk Waste).
The wastes, however, are different from a legal and regulatory perspective.
In-Kind Contributions are property or services that benefit a project and are contributed to the recipient (or any contractor under the grant agreement) by a third party, without direct monetary compensation.
In-kind contributions include donated or loaned real or personal property, volunteer services, and employee services donated by a third party.
These are not allowable under the Coordinated Prevention Grants Program, except as interlocal costs.
Interlocal Agreement means an agreement developed in accordance with Chapter 39.34 RCW, Interlocal Cooperation Act.
The Interlocal Agreement shall be signed by the authorized officials of the local governments involved, and shall specify the services and/or facilities to be provided and any compensation between the local governments for such services and/or facilities.
Interlocal Costs are in-kind contributions made to a project by another local government pursuant to a valid written agreement (such as an interlocal agreement) between the
28
recipient and the contributing entity that details the work to be accomplished, the goods and services to be provided, and the value thereof.
This is the only form of in-kind contribution allowed under the Coordinated Prevention Grant Program.
If the recipient reimburses another governmental entity for any portion of its contributions, the amount paid to the other entity is not an interlocal cost.
It is a cash expenditure on the part of the recipient.
Only the nonreimbursed portion of the other governmental entity's contributions is an interlocal cost.
Jurisdiction means a city, a county, a city-county joint entity, or a public health district/department.
Landfill means a disposal facility or part of a facility at which solid waste is permanently placed in or on land and which is not a land-spreading disposal facility.
Lead Implementation Agency means the agency designated in the adopted local hazardous or solid waste management plan as having the principal responsibility for the execution of all or most of the plan, and/or the coordinating agency which delegates responsibility to other agencies to execute portions of the plan.
Local Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan means the plan to manage solid waste that a local government is required to prepare pursuant to Chapter 70.95 RCW.
Local Government means any political subdivision, regional governmental unit, district, or municipal or public corporation, including cities, towns, and counties.
The term encompasses but does not refer specifically to the departments within a city, town, or county.
Local Hazardous Waste Management Plan means the plan to manage moderate risk waste that a local government is required to prepare pursuant to Chapter 70.105 RCW.
Match means that portion of the cash expenditures borne by recipient funds and the value of the interlocal costs applied to the project, if any.
Moderate Risk Waste means (a) any waste that exhibits any of the properties of hazardous waste but is exempt from regulation under Chapter 70.105 RCW solely because the waste is generated in quantities below the threshold for regulation, and (b) any household wastes that are generated from the disposal of substances identified by the Department as hazardous household substances or substances that exhibit any of the properties of hazardous waste.
Operating expenses means the day-to-day costs of running a facility, including labor.
Outcome means a measurable environmental or human health result.
Intermediate outcomes, like recycling tonnage, lead to ultimate outcomes, like energy conservation, emissions reduction, reduced human health risks.
It is important to understand what outcome each project seeks to accomplish, and to have a way of measuring that, but not every project need measure every possible outcome.
29
Output means a measurable activity taken towards an outcome.
For instance, conducting a workshop or supplying a compost bin is an output.
The outcomes would be the behavior change from the workshop or the diverted wastes from the compost bin.
Overhead means those costs that benefit more than one activity of the recipient (including the grant project) and that cannot be directly assigned to an objective of the project.
Pollution Prevention means source reduction, protection of natural resources by conservation, or increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources.
Source reduction is any practice that eliminates or reduces the amount of pollutants, contaminants, or hazardous substances, including fugitive emissions, entering a waste stream or being released into the environment.
The elimination or reduction is achieved prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal Recipient means the entity to which the funding is awarded and which is accountable for the use of the funds provided.
The recipient is the entire legal entity even if only one component or department is designated in the agreement document.
Recyclable Materials means those solid wastes separated for recycling or reuse, such as papers, metals, and glass that are identified as recyclable materials pursuant to a local comprehensive solid waste management plan.
Recycling means transforming or remanufacturing waste materials into usable or marketable materials for use other than landfill disposal or incineration.
Responsible Official means a grant recipient employee primarily responsible for working with Ecology on the grant project (e.g., public works director, public health director, recycling coordinator, solid waste planner).
Retroactive Funding means expenditures for work done prior to the effective date of the grant agreement.
Small Quantity Generator means a commercial generator of a waste that exhibits any of the properties of hazardous waste but is exempt from regulation under Chapter 70.105 RCW solely because the waste is generated or stored in quantities below the threshold for regulation.
Solid Waste means all putrescible and nonputrescible solid and semisolid wastes including, but not limited to, garbage, rubbish, ashes, industrial wastes, swill, demolition and construction wastes, abandoned vehicles or parts thereof, and recyclable materials.

Coordinated Prevention Grants Final Performance Analysis - 2004-2005 Purpose 
The Final Performance Analysis (FPA) also needs to describe successful projects and or what can be done differently next time to improve effectiveness.
The goal is to have audit-proof grant files and to have recipients reflect upon their work and evaluate it, allowing others to learn from it.
The FPA is also an instrument to report on special innovative or learning projects, whether or not funded with CPG.
The FPA should be submitted by February 15, 2006, usually in conjunction with your final payment request.
Final payment can not be made until an FPA is submitted to your Ecology grant officer.
(Further instructions and requirements are detailed in the Project Analysis portion of this form.)
Information on FPAs provided by all CPG recipients statewide will be compiled into a published report that aggregates and summarizes the quality environmental returns to demonstrate that CPG is complying with legislative audits and intent.

To measure how effective enforcement efforts are for illegal dumping, we will review complaints on an annual basis and determine the percentage that were resolved.
Appropriateness of method/technology Regular inspections and monitoring have proven to be the most appropriate methods of solid waste enforcement.
Maximum Eligible Cost: $133,333 Consistency with Plan: Solid waste enforcement activities are outlined in Section 10 of the 1999 Polk County Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan as being the responsibility of the health department.
Page 59
(6) PROJECT NARRATIVE AND JUSTIFICATION continued.
Project Description: Program Staff: The solid waste enforcement program currently has one full time FTE dedicated solely to solid waste enforcement activities, approximately .11 FTE is provided for program supervision and an additional five staff members provide a limited amount of investigation and educational activities in solid waste.
Equipment that will be purchased with grant funds includes a GPS unit for mapping solid waste sites, dumping locations, and hazardous waste sites.
Inspections Inspections are required at all permitted facilities under 173-304 WAC and 173-351 WAC, and will be required under 173-350 WAC when adopted.
We will fully inspect all six permitted facilities in our county on a quarterly basis with monthly inspections conducted at those facilities where it is deemed necessary.
Investigation activities are required under a variety of state and local codes and are generally in response to nuisances, such as, promiscuous dumping.
Monitoring is required of the county's two landfills for groundwater contamination, methane generation, waste volume, and other factors.
Our staff must observe and verify these monitoring activities to ensure facility compliance.
Enforcement Enforcement activities associated with complaint investigations and compliance activities at permitted facilities are required to achieve adequate public health protection.
Activities involved in this area include compliance schedules, letters, administrative support, and when necessary initiating legal action.
Permitting and Plan Review Permit review and renewal activities are required to ensure that proposed and existing facilities will be constructed and operated in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.
Furthermore, direct consultation with clients allows us to increase our understanding of proposals, clarifies issues, and develops strong working relationships with facility, laboratory, government, and consulting personnel.
Education The health department continues to develop and pursue educational avenues in the regulation of environmental concerns and grant funding will allow for the purchase and development of materials for solid waste education in the community.

PROJECT TITLE: Waste Reduction and Recycling - Activities Goal Statement: The goal is to provide a coordinated means to increase public awareness and knowledge about solid waste management, and to promote proper and effective waste reduction, recycling, and disposal habits.
Expected Outcomes/Impacts (environmental or health benefits): We anticipate an 8% increase in the recycling rate, and a 5% decrease in the amount of waste generated per capita by December 2005.
Measurement method (what will be measured and how): We will measure the recycling rate change from 2003 to 2005 by comparing Department recycling rate figures for our county.
We will measure decreases in waste amounts by comparing the per capita MSW disposed at county solid waste facilities from 2001-2003.
We also expect to see a 20% reduction in the amount of demolition waste being landfilled, which will be measured by comparing the amounts taken to the county landfill in 2001 and 2003.
Appropriateness of method/technology: Given the current state of recycling in Polk County, the measures chosen here represent our best estimate of what would incrementally increase participation in the various efforts we are involved in.
Maximum Eligible Cost: $270,000

Consistency with Plan: This project is consistent with the general education and awareness programs outlined throughout chapter 15 of the 1999 Polk County Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan.
Discussion of the Environmental Information Center is also contained in Chapter 4 (page 4-7).
Project Description: This project provides partial funding for the Environmental Information Center (EIC) and the A-Way With Waste teachers' training workshop program.
The EIC is co-sponsored by the City of Cleanair, Washington Public Utilities, Washington State University Cooperative Extension, Washington State University, Air Pollution Control Authority, Washington County Solid Waste, and Washington County Water Resources.
The EIC will distribute waste reduction and recycling materials to the community, educators and students; respond to phone inquiries; coordinate community events including the annual Earth Action Day and the Water Festival Eco Days; publish 12 issues of Greensleeves; obtain new titles and materials including books, videos, and curriculum materials for a reference library; assist educators with environmental education integration; provide up-to-date information to 2,000 callers to the Newsworthy Info-Line; and conduct teacher and community workshops and presentations.
The A-Way With Waste program is a separate component of the EIC funded by Polk County Solid Waste and the Air Pollution Control Authority.
Key components of the program are 2-day teacher workshops, a workshop alumni newsletter, classroom presentations, and environmental education integration assistance for educators and educators-in-training.
The program focuses on solid waste management issues including waste reduction and recycling, toxics reduction, and vermicomposting.
Air quality issues are also a component of the program.
At least six A-Way With Waste teacher's workshops will be conducted, four issues of the A-Way With Waste newsletter will be distributed, and fifteen classroom presentations will be conducted Master Composter/Recycler program staff and volunteers will provide education to the community on backyard composting and other organic waste diversion methods and waste reduction and recycling.
The county will conduct 16 backyard composting workshops, offer 4 vermicomposting workshops, install 50 additional worm bins in classrooms, develop a new booth display for community events, prepare twenty monthly volunteer newsletters, offer 2 volunteer training classes, educate 5,000 students through classroom and community event presentations, sell 200 compost bins through WSU Cooperative Extension, assist with two annual compost bin sales, and reach 20,000 residents at community events such as the Home and Garden Idea Fair, the Polk County Fair, the Water Festival, and the Cleanair Neighborhood Conference.
Polk County solid waste program staff will update the Polk County Recycling Directory annually.
Ten thousand copies will be printed and distributed to county and city residents each year.
The directory provides information on materials and resources related to waste reduction, reuse, and recycling in Polk County.
The directory will include information about automotive wastes, bulky items, construction and building materials, garbage, glass bottles and jars, hazardous wastes, metals, paper, plastics, yard debris, and other wastes; and include curbside collection services, drop-off sites, educational and local government resources, and business recycling collection services.
The Polk County solid waste program will purchase and distribute reusable shopping bags in 2002 to promote waste reduction.
The bags will be distributed at major grocery stores and home improvement centers as part of a campaign to reduce consumption and waste.
Before distributing the bags, county staff will train retail store employees on recycling, waste reduction, recycled products, and alternatives to toxics.
Polk County solid waste program has been donated a structure to be deconstructed as a demonstration project for demolition contractors.
The county will contract for deconstruction services and pay for all associated waste separation and recycling costs.
Project progress will be documented and recorded with photos for later promotional and education use.
A project summary and results will be presented to contractors and the development community.
Results and information generated from the deconstruction project will teach demolition contractors how to incorporate material recovery and recycling into bids for demolition projects.
If successful, agencies and other individuals requesting demolition and deconstruction services will request bids that include material recovery and recycling.
65
The county, in association with the Polk County Home Builders' Association, will contract for professional services to develop a homebuilder education program.
Working in cooperation with the building and development community allows the county to develop a non-regulatory, market-driven, environmentally sensitive home builder education program that promotes resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling.
Solid waste staff will coordinate communications with other local government departments and involved parties, sponsor training workshops for builders, manage the professional services contract, and ensure overall project goals are being met.
By the end of 2005, 10 of Polk County Home builders' Association members will be certified "green" builders; and 15 single family dwellings will be constructed and certified as "green" homes.
By the end of the 2005, 30 percent of builder members will be certified "green" builders and ten percent of the singe family dwellings constructed that year will be certified as "green" homes.
A handbook and self-certification checklist will be developed by the end of the first year.
Brochures for homebuyers, builders, and sellers will also be developed and distributed.
Training workshops will be conducted for building professionals and subcontractors, suppliers, designers, architects and realtors.

PROJECT TITLE: Household Hazardous Waste Collection 
Expected Outcomes/Impacts (environmental or health benefits) The project will result in 1,000 tons of hazardous waste diverted from landfills, public sewers, septic systems, storm drains, and land and properly disposed each year Measurement method (what will be measured and how) This will be measured by documenting waste quantities collected at facilities and events.
Appropriateness of method/technology : Fixed HHW facilities are proven to be more effective than occasional collection events.
Nevertheless, where the cost of operating a fixed facility exceeds the possible return, we will continue to offer collection events.
Maximum Eligible Cost: $664,208 Consistency with Plan: This project helps implement the goals of the 1999 Polk County Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (page 8-13) and the Moderate Risk Waste Management Plan (page 108-110) by providing for disposal of HHW. Project Description: Polk County Public Works contracts with Wecaremore Resource Co. to operate an ongoing HHW collection program at its two transfer stations.
HHW will continue to be collected, sorted, and packed at the facilities prior to being manifested and transported by the hazardous waste contractor to a treatment, storage, and disposal facility.
The exception is used oil, which will be used to heat the transfer station and county shop.
At each transfer station, we will collect all household hazardous wastes including oil, antifreeze, batteries, paints, pesticides/herbicides, solvents, etc.
69
In addition to year-round facilities, the county will hold annual HHW collection events, one in the Town of Washington and the other in the City of Xanadu.
Wecaremore Resource Co. will conduct these events.
They will transport the collected HHW to the nearest transfer station HHW facility when each event is over.
We will advertise these events in local publications.

PROJECT TITLE: Moderate Risk Waste Â­ Capital Supplemental request.
Goal Statement: To purchase equipment to enhance HHW collection at the north transfer station.
Expected Outcomes/Impacts (environmental or health benefits) The purchase of the refrigerant recovery machine will allow for higher efficiency in collecting HHW at the north transfer station.
Measurement method (what will be measured and how) This will be measured by the money saved for not paying a contractor.
Appropriateness of method/technology: At issue is having in-house capability versus contracting-out.
The current volume would justify in-house capability.
Maximum Eligible Cost: $2,000
Consistency with Plan: This project helps implement the goals of the Polk County Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (page 8-13) and the Moderate Risk Waste Management Plan (page 108-110) by providing for disposal of HHW. Project Description: We would like to buy a refrigerant recovery machine for the north transfer station.
Currently, appliances containing refrigerants are accumulated at the transfer station and the refrigerants removed by our contractor when they come to collect HHW.
With our own recovery machine, we could remove these HHW ourselves, saving money we pay the contractor for this service, and the transfer station will be more aestheticallypleasing by eliminating the pile of appliances that accumulates.

For Cause.
The obligation of the DEPARTMENT to the RECIPIENT is contingent upon satisfactory performance by the RECIPIENT of all of its obligations under this agreement.
In the event the RECIPIENT unjustifiably fails, in the opinion of the DEPARTMENT, to perform any obligation required of it by this agreement, the DEPARTMENT may refuse to pay any further funds thereunder and/or terminate this agreement by giving written notice of termination.
A written notice of termination shall be given at least five working days prior to the effective date of termination.
In that event, all finished or unfinished documents, data studies, surveys, drawings, maps, models, photographs, and reports or other materials prepared by the RECIPIENT under this agreement, at the option of the DEPARTMENT, shall become Department property and the RECIPIENT shall be entitled to receive just and equitable compensation for any satisfactory work completed on such documents and other materials.
82
Despite the above, the RECIPIENT shall not be relieved of any liability to the DEPARTMENT for damages sustained by the DEPARTMENT and/or the State of Washington because of any breach of agreement by the RECIPIENT.
The DEPARTMENT may withhold payments for the purpose of setoff until such time as the exact amount of damages due the DEPARTMENT from the RECIPIENT is determined.

Insufficient Funds.
The obligation of the DEPARTMENT to make payments is contingent on the availability of state and federal funds through legislative appropriation and state allotment.

The failure to appropriate or allot such funds shall be good cause to terminate this agreement as provided in paragraph K.1 above.
When this agreement crosses the RECIPIENT's fiscal year, the obligation of the RECIPIENT to continue or complete the project described herein shall be contingent upon appropriation of funds by the RECIPIENT's governing body; Provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall preclude the DEPARTMENT from demanding repayment of ALL funds paid to the RECIPIENT in accordance with Section O herein.
