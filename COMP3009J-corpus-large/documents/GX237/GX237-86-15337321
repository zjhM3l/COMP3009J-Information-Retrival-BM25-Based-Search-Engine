Colorado State Flag Department of Law line graphic _________________________________________________________________ December 11, 2001 ATTORNEY GENERAL SALAZAR REISSUES ANTHRAX HOAX WARNING-- LONG PRISON SENTENCES COULD APPLY Denver-- Attorney General Ken Salazar today reiterated a warning to persons who engage in false reporting chemical, biological or other dangerous weapon threats or perpetrating actions intended to threaten the lives or well-being of others.
In October, Salazar and the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police and the County Sheriffs of Colorado issued their first warning to reinforce those of federal and other authorities that anthrax hoaxes or threats cannot be tolerated.
Today's re-issuance of the warning comes in the wake of Monday's "anthrax" scare in the attorney general's office following the receipt of a letter in the office mailroom and discovery of a suspicious powder contained in that letter.
The building was subsequently evacuated.
Initial tests on the substance indicate the substance is not anthrax or other biohazard.
"If the perpetrator of this scare on the people of my office and other workers and visitors in the State Services Building believe their stunt has no repercussions, I advise them to think again," Attorney General Salazar said.
"Making such threats or hoaxes both constitute state crimes as well as federal crimes, and we will work with federal and local law enforcement to find whoever did this."
"I am proud of the response and reaction of our staff," Salazar continued.
"In particular, the three employees most directly impacted by the scare were back on their jobs first thing Tuesday morning."
Various Colorado state laws could apply to Monday's scare and other such threats or hoaxes.
* False Reports of explosives, weapons, or harmful substances.
Any person who knowingly falsely reports to any other person that a bomb or other explosive, any chemical or biological agent, or any poison or weapon has been placed in any public or private place or vehicle commits a class 6 felony, punishable by 1 year-18 months imprisonment.
* Aggravated criminal extortion.
A person commits aggravated criminal extortion if the person threatens another with economic hardship, bodily injury, or damage to their property or reputation through the use of chemical or biological weapons or poison for the purpose of inducing the victim to take action against their will or to refrain from engaging in otherwise lawful activity.
Aggravated criminal extortion is a class 3 felony, punishable by 4-12 years imprisonment.
* Menacing.
A person commits the crime of menacing if, by any threat or physical action, he or she knowingly places or attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.
Menacing is a class 3 misdemeanor punishable by three months to twelve months imprisonment, $250-$1,000 fine, or both.
Menacing constitutes a class 5 felony, punishable by 1-3 year's imprisonment, if committed by the use of a deadly weapon.
The perpetrator of this crime need not actually have a deadly weapon.
The perpetrator is criminally liable if he or she indicates to the victim in some way that he or she is armed with a deadly weapon or uses an item fashioned in such a manner to cause a person to believe that the article is a deadly weapon.
A deadly weapon includes any weapon, device, instrument, material, or substance that if used as intended is capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.
