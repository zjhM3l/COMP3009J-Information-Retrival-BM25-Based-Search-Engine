North Carolina Department of Correction - Correction News - March 1999 Spotlight on Wayne Correctional Center - page 3 [marczyk.jpg] Frank Marczyk is the treatment director for the DART unit at Wayne.
He leads four therapy groups each with 25 inmates.
The DART program started at Wayne.
DART-Wayne now has 100 inmates coming through it a month.
Another 14 to 16 are in DART aftercare.
Wayne also trains the peer counselors for the other DART units across the state.
For nearly three years, Bobby Game has worked as a program assistant at Wayne.
"I work with the inmates getting them assigned to programs," Game said.
"Some come in wanting to get into school and get ready to return to society."
One of the prized pictures in the office is a photo of Ginger, the family's full-blooded cocker spaniel.
Each morning on the way into work, he drops Ginger off at the babysitter, or dogsitter, and picks her up on the way home.

John Perry manages the prison's road squads.
The prison sends out five 12-man road squads Monday through Friday.
Perry coordinates their work projects with DOT engineers.
He also works to make sure his officers and their crews are properly equipped.
He said the prison kitchen has been doing a great job with pack out lunches lately, something that means a lot to the men who spend their day working hard, chopping and clearing brush.
