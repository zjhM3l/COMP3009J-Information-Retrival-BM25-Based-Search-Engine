As a second-generation Hmong immigrant, Lia recalls the historical events that brought her family to the United States.
She also tells of the struggles faced by her mother and father and people of their generation after they were forced to leave their homeland (Laos) and re-establish their lives amidst a culture far different from their own.
Lia explains many of the fundamental concepts and practices of the ancient Hmong culture - weddings, funerals, the "ball toss," the shaman, clans, the "flower cloth" - and relates how those traditions and beliefs have framed who and what Hmong people are.
She and her older brother Seng also reflect on the difficulties that have arisen from trying to live according to Hmong tradition in the western society of the United States.
