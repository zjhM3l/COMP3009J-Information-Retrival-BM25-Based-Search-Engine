Appendix E. continued BLM Land Health Standards Land Health Standards.
Adopt the rangeland health standards developed for livestock grazing in consultation with the California Desert District Advisory Council, for use as regional land health standards.
These regional land health standards would apply to all BLM lands and programs, and would be implemented through terms and conditions of permits, leases and other authorizations, actions, resource monitoring, assessments undertaken in accordance with BLM's land use plans.
BLM would seek to incorporate these standards into the multijurisdictional monitoring program for the CVMSHCP, and to coordinate with local jurisdictions in monitoring and assessment of land health.
These standards may not be used to permanently prohibit allowable uses established by law, regulation or land use plans.
1.
Soils.
Soils exhibit infiltration and permeability rates that are appropriate to soil type, climate, geology, landform, and past uses.
Adequate infiltration and permeability of soils allow accumulation of soil moisture necessary for optimal plant growth and vigor, and provide a stable watershed.
As indicated by: Â· Canopy and ground cover are appropriate for the site; Â· There is diversity of plant species with a variety of root depths; Â· Litter and soil organic matter are present at suitable sites; Â· Maintain the presence of microbiotic soil crusts that are in place; Â· Evidence of wind or water erosion does not exceed natural rates for the site; and Â· Hydrologic and nutrient functions maintained by permeability of soil and water infiltration are appropriate for precipitation.
Native Species.
Healthy, productive and diverse habitats for native species, including special status species (Federal T
As indicated by: Â· Photosynthetic and ecological processes continue at levels suitable for the site, season, and precipitation regimes; Â· Plant vigor, nutrient cycle, and energy flow are maintaining desirable plants and ensuring reproduction and recruitment; Â· Plant communities are producing litter within acceptable limits; Â· Age class distribution of plants and animals are sufficient to overcome mortality fluctuations; Â· Distribution and cover of plant species and their habitats allow for reproduction and recovery from localized catastrophic events; Â· Alien and noxious plants and wildlife do not exceed acceptable levels; Â· Appropriate natural disturbances are evident; and Â· Populations and their habitats are sufficiently distributed to prevent the need for listing special status species.
Riparian / Wetland and Stream Function.
Wetland systems associated with subsurface, running, and standing water, function properly and have the ability to recover from major disturbances.
Hydrologic conditions are maintained.
As indicated by: Â· Vegetative cover will adequately protect banks, and dissipate energy during peak water flows; Â· Dominant vegetation is an appropriate mixture of vigorous riparian species; Â· Recruitment of preferred species is adequate to sustain the plant community;

Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· 4.
Stable soils store and release water slowly; Plant species present indicate soil moisture characteristics are being maintained; There is minimal cover of invader/shallow-rooted species, and they are not displacing deep-rooted native species; Maintain shading of stream courses and water sources for riparian dependent species; Stream is in balance with water and sediment being supplied by the watershed; Stream channel size and meander is appropriate for soils, geology, and landscape; and Adequate organic matter (litter and standing dead plant material) is present to protect the site and to replenish soil nutrients through decomposition.
Water quality.
Surface and groundwater complies with objectives of the Clean Water Act and other applicable water quality requirements, including meeting the California State standards.
Best Management Practices would be implemented to help achieve these standards.
Achievement of standards would be indicated by: Â· Chemical constituents, water temperature, nutrient loads, fecal coliform, turbidity, suspended sediment and dissolved oxygen do not exceed the applicable requirements.
Â· Achievement of the standards for riparian, wetlands and water bodies; Â· Aquatic organisms and plants (e.g., macro invertebrates, fish, algae and plants) indicate support for beneficial uses; and Â· Monitoring results or other data that show water quality is meeting the standards.
