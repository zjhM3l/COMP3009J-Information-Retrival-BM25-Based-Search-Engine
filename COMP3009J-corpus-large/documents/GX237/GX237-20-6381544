BUREA U OF THE CENSUS Bureau of the Census Mission Statement To be the preeminent collector and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States.
T
he Bureau of the Census's mission is built around its large-scale surveys and censuses.
This involves the full range of activities required to produce data, including survey and questionnaire design and data collection, processing, and dissemination.
Research and data analysis will directly support the Census Bureau's capabilities to conduct large-scale surveys and censuses.
Through strategic planning, the Census Bureau evaluates how best to accomplish this mission.
The strategic plan provides a framework for articulating program goals and builds these goals through consensus.
The planning process promotes synergy, innovation, and eff iciency, and represents a better way of doing business.
The goal of the Census Bureau is to provide the best mix of timeliness, relevancy, quality, and cost for the data collected and services provided.
The data provided by the Census Bureau shape important policy decisions that help improve our nation's social and economic conditions: Census data are used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding.
Census data provide the basis for estimating the gross domestic product and leading economic indicators.
Census data determine the apportionment of Congressional seats, as mandated in the Constitution.
Census data inform about education, income, poverty, and health insurance coverage.
National, state, and local governments use Census data to formulate policy.
Large cor porations and local businesses use Census data to devise their business plans.
To accomplish its mission, the Census Bureau depends on actions that: Provide the U.S.'s off icial measures on monthly unemployment, income, poverty, and health insurance coverage, as well as economic indicators that include housing starts, retail and wholesale trade sales, international trade, manufacturers' shipments, orders, and inventories, and quarterly estimates of cor porate prof its.
Provide the statistical foundation and benchmark measures against which most data-based decisions and activities take place.
Reengineer the 2010 Decennial Census of Population and Housing to be more eff icient and cost-effective, provide richer and more timely data, and reduce risk in meeting constitutional and legislative mandates.

Invest in statistical methodological research and new technologies to improve cur rent operations and prepare for the future.
Continue to provide strict security of census information, address privacy issues, and foster program goals while maintaining conf identiality of census information.
Priorities/Management Challenges To deliver high value, the Bureau must target measurement on those trends and segments of our population and economy most critical to continued U.S. success and prosperity.
During FY 2002, the Census Bureau focused activities in these areas through a variety of priority program efforts that continue and improve ongoing statistical programs.
They included distributing Census 2000 data, planning the 2010 Census, obtaining cyclical economic data through the Economic Censuses and the Census of Governments, and completing data collection for the 2001 American Community Survey (ACS).
Greater resistance to authority, continued decline in trust of government, and a greater demand for quality have complicated the Census Bureau's data gathering efforts and ability to maintain or increase response rates.
The Bureau will have to continually demonstrate its expertise in educating the public on the quality and security of its data, and its ongoing sensitivity to anonymity and privacy issues.
Surveys have shown that more people feel they have less time available to do what they need to do, including work, sleep, look after their families, and enjoy leisure.
The Census Bureau will consider new approaches to saving customers' time and reduce respondent burden to ensure that the customers' needs are met.
The Census Bureau will continue environments.
The Bureau must use and timely information on emerging of criminal and/or malicious access to improve the use of technology in data collection, processing, and dissemination state-of-the-art technology to stay ahead of the demand from policy makers for accurate economic and societal trends.
As always, the Census Bureau will mitigate the possibility to all of its networks and data.
The Census Bureau's mission is "to be the preeminent collector and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States.
" This mission has and will continue to be the Bureau's focus as the environment in which it works changes.
FY 2002 Performance In FY 2002, the Census Bureau had three goals and seven measures.
Of those seven measures, the Bureau met all of them.
The performance measures focused on providing and improving cur rent measures of the U.S. population, economy, and governments; timely release of Decennial Census products; and the implementation of the 2010 Decennial Census.
Census Bureau performance in FY 2002 included meeting the target for the percentage completion of its housing unit address list.
Having a complete housing unit address list is critical for conducting an accurate 2010 Decennial Census.
The Bureau has also successfully released 2001 data from the long form transitional database, which is important for the implementation of the ACS.
The Census Bureau successfully met all the measures associated with the goals in the FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan.

This goal was previously worded as:"Develop relevant, accurate and timely, national and community economic and household statistics for decision-making")
Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably.
Rationale for Performance Goal Demographic Statistics: The Census Bureau's demographic statistics program staff is responsible for developing plans and programs to collect, process, and disseminate information from surveys and censuses on the population and its characteristics, and on the size and characteristics of the housing inventory.
The Bureau undertakes analytical research on emerging issues and trends, such as the condition of children and the elderly, the employment of disabled individuals, and the characteristics of immigrants.
Directing and coordinating technical and developmental work on the collection and analysis of data by race, Hispanic origin, and ancestry are major responsibilities.
This work results in reports on the characteristics of special population groups and on American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Village areas.
An important aspect is examining reporting issues, such as er ror or bias in these data.
Off icial statistics on income, poverty, and health insurance coverage, as well as longitudinal data on income and program participation that federal agencies use to develop, modify, and monitor income transfer programs, come from demographic programs.
Especially important are data necessary to determine the impact of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, often called welfare reform.
Demographic program staffers conduct much of the foundational analysis and research underlying the U.S.
Off ice of Management and Budget's (OMB's) decisions on national statistical standards on topics such as occupational classif ications, metropolitan areas, and race and ethnicity.
The demographic programs also plan and conduct surveys and special censuses, funded by other federal agencies that focus on topics of national importance, such as unemployment, crime, health, education, and consumer expenditures.

Explanation of Measure Maintaining a high response rate for household surveys ensures that the Bureau's survey information is always reliable, comparable, and widely accepted by customers over the longer term.
Since the sample design, interview content, length, and respondent rules vary by survey and are cor related with response rates, our target measures are different: (1) The Cur rent Population Survey (CPS), the National Crime Victimization Survey, and the American Housing Survey, can maintain a ninety percent or better response rate.
These households have rotating address-based panels and are usually contacted by a Field Representative (FR) in person when they f irst enter the sample and remain in sample for repeated visits over a prescribed period of time.
The rotating design also ensures that there is a mix of new and returning households which serves to stabilize response rates over time.
FRs can make subsequent contacts by appointment and by telephone if the respondent wishes.
Households that move are not followed; the new occupants are eligible for the interview.
This methodology, coupled with an interview lasting from ten to forty minutes depending on the household size, is conducive to maximizing response rates.
However, response rates across all surveys, regardless of design and content, have been declining in recent years as we compete with other surveys and demands on the public's time.
(2) The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) uses a different design in that a household is in the sample only once, the FR has a short interval of time to conduct the interview, and the average interview length is sixty minutes, hence the lower target response rate of eighty-seven percent.
(3) The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is on average a sixty-minute household interview and collects information on income, assets, transfer program participation, and various other socio-economic topics.
Since 1996, the SIPP has had "abutting" rather than overlapping panels which means that at any given time, all households have been in sample for the same time period, i.e., there is no replenishment of sample as in the CPS, NCVS, and AHS designs.
In addition, respondents are interviewed every four months, are encouraged to consult their records and to report their social security number to ensure accurate data, and are followed to new locations if they move during the life of the panel which is usually three to four years.
These design features, particularly the requirement to follow original household members, have contributed to shar p declines in panel response rates in recent years.
The Census Bureau has taken several steps to maximize response such as monetary incentives, redesigned introductory letters and materials, and enhanced FR training.
The target response rates consider the age of the panel in the appropriate year.
The FY 2001 performance level for this measure was achieved as the measure was then worded.
In FY 2001, the initial response rates for the Cur rent Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the American Housing Survey, and the American Community Survey were all greater than ninety percent.
There were no changes to the FY 2002 Performance Plan, but beginning in FY 2003 the measure was expanded to include longitudinal surveys for which the high initial response rates are diff icult to maintain over time.
FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance level for this measure was achieved.
The Census Bureau was able to achieve an initial response rate of ninety percent or greater for our cross-sectional household surveys.
This measure excludes household expenditure surveys.
These response rates are developed during the data collection phase of the survey.

This measure was previously worded as: "Percentage reduction from time of data collection to data release for selected household surveys.")
Explanation of Measure The Bureau has achieved optimal release times for many long-standing household surveys; for example, the Bureau releases data from the American Housing Survey nine months after collection.
Other household surveys have different schedules based on their designs.
This measure addresses newer surveys and survey supplements, such as SIPP and the Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD).
For SIPP, the Bureau was able to maintain the nine percent time reduction that was established in FY 1999 (the SPD was not part of the measure in FY 2001 or FY 2002).
SIPP collects a "core" of data items on detailed income, program participation, and work experience at four-month intervals from a cohort of households that are in the sample for approximately three years.
Each four-month interval is refer red to as a "wave" of interviewing and in addition to the core items, questions measuring other aspects of household economic and social well-being are included as "topical modules" during each wave.
The core data supplies longitudinal (studies in which variables relating to an individual or group of individuals are assessed over a period of time) measures over the life of the panel while the topical module data supplies cross-sectional (studies that focus on phenomena that occur during a precise time interval, such as a calendar year) measures at one or more points in time.
SPD -- The SPD is a follow-on survey conducted with SIPP respondents from the 1992 and 1993 panels who were last interviewed in 1995 and 1996, respectively, to comply with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as the 1996 Welfare Reform Act.
FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance level for this measure was achieved.
The bureau was able to maintain the production time schedule as was achieved in FY 1999 for SIPP and SPD.
This schedule was established as part of the project management tools for the programs.

Explanation of Measure This was a new specif ic performance measure for FY 2002.
The Census Bureau provides statistics that are critical to understanding cur rent conditions in our economy.
These statistics include the principal federal economic indicators that drive national monetary policy, federal economic policymaking and investment, and business decisions.
These principal economic indicators include the Advance Retail Sales; Manufacturing and Trade: Inventories and Sales; Monthly Wholesale Trade; Advanced Report on Durable Goods, Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders; Construction Put in Place; Quarterly Financial Report (QFR): Manufacturing, Mining, and Wholesale Trade; New Residential Construction; New Residential Sales; QFR: Retail; Housing Vacancies; and the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services, jointly released with the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
Previously, the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services measure was reported in the BEA's Annual Program Performance Report and Annual Performance Plan with reference to the Census Bureau's data collection and processing responsibilities.
OMB statistical directive no. 3 requires that data for Census Bureau principal economic indicators be released within prescribed time periods.
For most monthly indicators this means that they must be made available within one month of the end of the reference period, and for the quarterly indicators within two and a half months.
Release dates for these indicators are available online at www.census.gov/epcd/econ/www/indijun.htm.
Our goal is to release all 116 monthly and quarterly principal economic indicators on time.
FY 2002 Performance During FY 2002, all principal economic indicators were released on time.
The Census Bureau's principal economic indicators are among some of the most important and closely followed statistics generated by the federal statistical system.
These indicators provide government policymakers and private decisionmakers with timely information about the cur rent performance of the U.S. economy.
During FY 2002, all principal economic indicators were released on time.
Program Evaluation The Census Bureau's statistical program evaluations are numerous and ongoing.
One measure the Bureau uses to determine data reliability is initial response rates.
One measure the Bureau uses to determine timeliness is the elapsed time from data collection to data release.
The following are some examples of Census Bureau program evaluations.
Demographic Statistics The Census Bureau regularly generates quality prof iles and management reports for both reimbursable and Bureau-sponsored demographic surveys.
These prof iles and reports provide statistical measures of reliability and note compliance with or accomplishment of project tasks.
Economic Statistics Evaluation of programs by the economic statistics staff has led to better measures of capital expenditures by U.S. companies, improved the Bureau's ability to capture data on e-commerce activities, clarif ied the information companies can provide on their pollution abatement activities, and periodically documented, as required by OMB, the statistical rigor of the methodologies used to produce the principal economic indicators.

Performance Goal 2: Provide the statistical foundation and benchmark measures of the population, economy, and government that meet the needs of policy makers, federal, state, and local governmental agencies, businesses and the public.
(This goal has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP).
This goal was previously worded as:"Conduct the Decennial Census (FY 2000, FY 2001, and FY 2002")
Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably.
Rationale for Performance Goal The Census Bureau's benchmark programs are a major source of baseline information upon which most data-based decisions and activities take place.
Whether gathered through the Decennial Census of Population and Housing, the upcoming 2002 and 2007 Economic Censuses and the 2002 and 2007 Census of Governments, or the Intercensal Demographic Estimates that provide baseline demographic information in between the decennial censuses, the Census Bureau's Benchmark programs are where everyone turns to for information.
The demographic programs provide the data used by the states and other agencies to allocate nearly $200 billion dollars in federal funds each year, conduct the analyses that underlie the statistical def initions and standards used by the entire federal government in policy decisions, and establish the baseline sample units that underlie virtually every survey conducted in the United States by both private and public sectors.
The economic statistics programs count and prof ile U.S. businesses and government organizations in a rapidly-evolving economic environment.
They include conducting an Economic Census and a Census of Governments every f ive years.
The Economic Census covers all nonagricultural sectors of the economy, publishes data on the activities of more than twenty-two million businesses and more than 1,100 industries, and provides detailed geographic information.
As a complement to the sectoral Economic Census program components, the Census Bureau also conducts a series of related programs to collect information on topics of special interest, for example, minority and women-owned businesses, the characteristics of the nation's trucking fleet, business expenses, the flow of commodities, and the economies of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Census of Governments represents the primary source of facts about the structure and function of the public sector of the U.S. economy.
It provides essential information to Congress and federal agencies for planning and evaluating programs that involve intergovernmental relationships.
The census contributes an important element for constructing composite national economic measures, such as gross domestic product, the Bureau of Economic Analysis's input-output tables that measure market sectors, and the Federal Reserve Board's flow of funds accounts that provide time-series data of f inancial flows in the economy.
The Census of Governments' f indings supply vital analytical tools for a wide variety of data users.
Among the most prominent are state and local government off icials, educational organizations, criminal justice organizations, public interest groups, private industry, economic research agencies, and the media.

Performance Goal 2 focuses on the major conduct and dissemination milestones for the 2002 Economic and Government Censuses and providing improved demographic intercensal estimates.
Specif ic performance goals and measures related to these activities include Publishing and disseminating data from the 2002 Economic Census and the 2002 Census of Governments on a timely, scheduled basis Mailing Survey of Business Owners forms for the 2002 Economic Census FY 2002 Performance During FY 2002, measures for this goal were successfully met.
During FY 2002 the Census Bureau continued to produce and deliver data products from Census 2000.
This includes Summary File 3 (SF3), which consists of over 800 detailed tables of Census 2000 social, economic, and housing characteristics compiled from a sample of approximately nineteen million housing units that received the Census 2000 long-form questionnaire.
The Census 2000 SF3 tables have been produced signif icantly earlier in the census cycle relative to previous decennial censuses.
The SF3 f iles are used for the distribution of federal funds each year as well as a myriad of other public and private sector planning and decision-making uses.
All planned data product releases for FY 2002 were completed on schedule.

(This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP).
This measure was previously worded as: "Disseminate Census 2000 products.")
Explanation of Measure Providing releases of Census 2000 products on schedule is critical to the institutions and individuals responsible for managing or evaluating federal programs.
The releases are also needed to meet legal requirements stemming from U.S. court decisions, such as the Voting Rights Act.
The data collected and released are as much a part of the nation's infrastructure as highways and telephone lines.
Federal dollars supporting schools, employment services, housing assistance, highway construction, hospital services, programs for the elderly, and more are distributed based on Census data.
For example, twenty-two of the twenty-f ive largest federal funding grant programs in f iscal year 1998 were responsible for $162 billion being distributed to state, local, and tribal governments.
About half of this money was distributed using formulas involving Census population data, according to the General Accounting Off ice.
The Bureau expects that at least $182 billion and housing will be distributed annually based on formulas using Census 2000 data.
Program Evaluation The continued dissemination of data products to federal, state, local and tribal governments, as well as to users in the private and public sectors make them available for countless applications.
Some uses of the data include the resolution of population and boundary issues, and the distribution of federal dollars to states and localities to meet their needs.

Performance Goal 3: Re-engineer the 2010 Decennial Census to be more efficient and cost effective, provide richer data, improve coverage, and reduce risk in meeting constitutional and legislative mandates.
(This goal has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP).
This goal was previously worded as: "Def ine--through consultations, policy assessment, planning, research, experiments, and evaluations--the plan for the 2010 Census")
Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably
Rationale for Performance Goal Despite the fact that Census 2000 was an operational success, it was conducted with high costs and at great operational risk.
In 2010, the job will be even more complex.
Given the rapid demographic and technological changes experienced in recent years and the strong expectation that such changes will continue to accelerate, once-a-decade data collection and updating operations are no longer suff icient.
Without a more systematic, timely, and integrated planning and design strategy, the data collection mission of the Census Bureau, especially of the 2010 Census, will be jeopardized.
The Census Bureau has developed a strategy to meet this challenge.
The strategy for the 2010 Census is to reduce operational risks, improve accuracy, provide more relevant data, and contain costs.
Based on the fundamental approach of redesigning the 2010 Census, there are three interdependent components of this strategy: Implementation of the American Community Survey (ACS) to collect decennial census long-form information on an ongoing basis to provide for yearly/annual data products Modernization of The Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) address and geographic database that takes advantage of space-based technologies, such as satellite and aerial imagery and geographic information system (GIS) data from state, local, and tribal governments, to bring the MAF/TIGER system into alignment with Global Positioning System (GPS) information Systematic development, testing, and implementation of a short form only 2010 Census design that takes advantage of the opportunities offered by an enhanced MAF/TIGER and the American Community Survey.
The Census Bureau planned implementation of the American Community Survey in 2003 so that by 2010 the Bureau can provide a reliable replacement for the long-form portion of the 2010 Census.
The Census Bureau started exploring this design option after by limiting it to the collection of the basic data needed for Bureau would meet the data requirements of federal agencies a Continuous Measurement program.
Although time did not the 1990 Census with the objective of simplifying Census 2000 apportionment and redistricting.
Under this design, the Census as well as those of users outside the federal government through permit the development of a Continuous Measurement program

for Census 2000, developmental work was commissioned with an eye toward the 2010 Census.
This work has continued resulting in the design of a system that can meet not only the federal mandates for data, but also can meet them with more timely and accurate data.
This data collection effort, the American Community Survey, is a way to both improve coverage of the census (by way of operational simplif ication) and to reduce the operational risks of the census.
The American Community Survey will provide the timely information needed for critical economic planning by governments and the private sector.
In our information-based economy, federal, state, and local decision makers and private business and nonprof it organizations need cur rent, reliable, and comparable economic data to chart the future.
The American Community Survey will provide up-to-date prof iles of U.S. communities every year beginning in 2004, providing policymakers, planners, and service providers in the public and private sectors with information every year--not just once every ten years.
MAF/TIGER Modernization--The f ive objectives of the MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program are to: 1 2 3 4 5
cor rect the locations of all streets, other map features, and required structures; develop a modern processing environment; enhance geographic partnerships; develop new methods to update the address list in predominately rural areas; and fully integrate quality assurance measures into the geographic and MAF/TIGER systems and databases to meet the needs of the 2010 Census (including the American Community Survey) and related early testing activities.
The new processing environment is needed to modernize a homegrown geographic database and to take advantage of commercially-available practices and technologies.
The MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program will allow the ACS and the 2010 Census to take advantage of GPS technology and mobile computers to improve on outdated and er ror-prone methodologies, while substantially expanding geographic partnerships at the state, local, and tribal levels to maintain the completeness and accuracy of the information in the address and geographic systems that are essential for a successful 2010 Census.
Ongoing address and geographic partnership programs coupled with technological improvements such as a GPS-linked system will help reduce the level of address duplication and geographic misassignment that was evident in Census 2000.
Procedures will be streamlined and made more eff icient by providing f ield staff with tools and technology that enable them to greatly reduce such er rors in the 2010 Census.
The 2010 Census will be armed with a more comprehensive, timely, and accurate address list--one of the best predictors of a successful census--without the added complexity, risk, and costs of last minute address list-building operations.
2010 Census planning, development, and testing--The objective of 2010 Census planning, development, and testing is to conduct early testing and prototyping of new and streamlined activities to take advantage of the fact that long form data will be collected by the ACS and therefore will not be needed as part of the 2010 short form collection effort; the MAF/TIGER Enhancement Program which will provide the Bureau with a system that is in GPS alignment; the results of the Census 2000 testing, experimentation, and evaluation program; and new research to build on the success of Census 2000.

Both the MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program and the American Community Survey are integral to a successful 2010 Census and, therefore, integral to the Census Bureau's planning activities.
In addition, based on lessons learned from Census 2000, developing a design infrastructure that leads to early operational testing is crucial.
This will require strong leadership, expert planning, sophisticated integration efforts, and oversight support.
A major task is the development of the strategic framework to guide (1) interactions among the three components, (2) risk identif ication and management, (3) product development, (4) analysis of operational alternatives, (5) development of the research agendas, (6) integration of solutions into a logical design, and (7) plans for testing.
FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance levels for all measures were achieved.
The Census Bureau completed the initial steps required for MAF/TIGER modernization including preparing a plan and systems to measure housing unit coverage.
In FY 2002 the Bureau signed its f irst major contract with the Har ris Cor poration in the effort to re-engineer the 2010 Decennial Census for the MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project.
Also in FY 2002, the Census Bureau successfully completed data collection for the 2001 ACS and the 2002 ACS through September, 2002.
The Census Bureau completed all necessary data collection and data processing activities to be ready for expanding the ACS for 2003 into every county in the U.S. and every municipio in Puerto Rico.

Explanation of Measure Cor rectly locating every street and other map features in the MAF/TIGER database is critical to providing geographic products and services that meet the accuracy expectations of the 2010 Census f ield data collection staff, the Census Bureau's data product customers, and the needs of The National Map/Homeland Defense effort.
The Census Bureau's f ield staff has reported extensive diff iculties in completing address list updating and verif ication tasks, and in f inding addresses and streets that required follow-up visits in Census 2000.
Many local or tribal governments that participated in the Census 2000 geographic partnership programs and many potential customers for MAF/TIGER geographic products have told the Census Bureau that they would not consider future geographic partnership or use without substantial improvements in location accuracy.

This measure was previously worded as: "Release 2001 data from LFTB.")
Explanation of Measure The Census Long-Form Transitional Database (LFTDB) is the key to replacing the Census long form with the ACS.
As part of the Decennial Census operations in FY 2000 and FY 2001, the Bureau has been conducting the LFTDB evaluation study.
The FY 2002 plan for the LFTDB is a critical part of the transition to using data from the ACS as a national program beginning in FY 2003 (a performance measurement commitment in the Department of Commerce FY 2000Ã¯Â¿Â½FY 2005 Strategic Plan).
When the ACS becomes a comprehensive national program, community prof iles will be available every year rather than every ten years.
These vastly improved data will enable the U.S. government to distribute billions of dollars much more eff iciently and to more effectively evaluate federal programs.
FY 2002 Performance Census completed all data collection for the 2001 LFTDB by January 2002.
Data collection was completed across all three modes of collection with an overall response rate exceeding ninety-f ive percent.
The data products also were produced, but the Census Bureau decided to delay release of these products until November 2002 because of the potential confusion with Census 2000 sample data products being released during the latter part of FY 2002.
