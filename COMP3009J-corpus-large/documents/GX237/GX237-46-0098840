ROCHESTER CIVIC MUSIC - SPRING 2003
Dear Friends: My name is Kurt Augustine and I am the new President of the Rochester Civic Music Board of Directors.
My term begins under a shadow of irony as Civic Music is enjoying it's greatest success at the box office and in the park, while the city, state and world is at palpable unrest.
It is, however, at times like these that our community has the potential to come together and help each other heal.
Now is the time we should turn to arts and entertainment to help us understand, build community and, if only for a short while, escape the trials of the world.
The Riverside Live! 2003-2004 season has the potential to do just that.
From the bayou boogie woogie blues of Marcia Ball to the traditional Irish music of Cherish the Ladies; from the sounds of Vietnam with Khac Chi to the back porches of Dixie with the Nashville Bluegrass Band; from Britain's's vocal legends the King's Singers to a farewell concert from their American counterpart, Anonymous 4; from 'the border of Mexico' with Christopher Cross to Yasgur's farm with Richie Havens; we've got it all!

of virtuosic instrumental talents, beautiful vocals, captivating arrangements and stunning step dancing, this powerhouse group combines all the facets of Irish traditional culture and puts it forth in an immensely humorous and entertaining package.
The past years have seen the group traveling all over North and South America, the United Kingdom and Europe performing in the finest concert halls and international festivals.
They have been named Entertainment Group of the Year by the Irish Voice Newspaper and received the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall's International Group of the Year Award at the Celtic Connections Festival in Scotland.

tunebooks of the 19th- century, and spiritual and gospel hymns as sung by Ralph Stanley (recently heard on the soundtrack of "O Brother; Where Art Thou") and Emmylou Harris.
The music in this program comes from an interweaving of oral and written traditions, in which favorite older tunes have survived and flourished from one generation to the next, along with newer tunes, for over 200 years.
A few highlights of "American Angels" will be William Billings' 'Jordan', shape-note settings of 'Amazing Grace' and 'Wondrous Love', and good old hymns like 'Angel Band'.
Renowned for their unearthly vocal blend and virtuosic ensemble singing, the four women who comprise Anonymous 4 combine musical, literary, and historical scholarship with contemporary performance intuition as they create ingeniously designed programs, interweaving music with poetry and narrative.
Anonymous 4 performs in major cities throughout North America, including New York, Boston, Washington DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, and Toronto, among others.
Celebrated regulars at major international festivals, Anonymous 4 has appeared throughout Europe, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Hong Kong.
Recently branching out into the realm of contemporary music, Anonymous 4 has premiered works by John Tavener, Steve Reich, and Richard Einhorn.
The ensemble has appeared on a wide range of radio and television programs, including Garrison Keillor's "A Prairie Home Companion," CBS Sunday Morning," and A
Anonymous 4's award-winning recordings of medieval music have attained unprecedented popularity, rising to the top of Billboard's classical chart, and selling over a million copies worldwide.

Whatever you do, don't miss this chance to see one of the world's finest vocal ensembles on their farewell tour.

I know it's crazy, but it's true! Were you to mention the name Christopher Cross to a group of average Joes-on-the-street, you'd be certain to elicit one or more of the following responses: "Oh, yeah -- Sailing!", "He did that Arthur movie song", "Ride Like the Wind rocked!" Pressed any further, the same people might respond along the lines of, "Where'd he go?" or continued on page 4 3

continued from page 3 "He just put out that green album with the stork on it and disappeared."
But mention to those folks some other titles -- Never Be the Same, Think of Laura, All Right, et al -- and you'd probably see the recognition register.
"I guess he did have more hits", or perhaps, "I remember now -- his second album was that pink one with the duck on it."
They were flamingos, but no matter.
Our point being, Christopher Cross never went away.
Eight albums, eight hit singles, several world tours, five Grammys, and one Oscar later, Mr. Cross is still going strong! And he's coming to Rochester to spend Valentine's weekend with you.
Do not miss it.

and pop, their repertoire is allencompassing.
As well as performing in many of the world's major concert halls the list of venues at which they have appeared is equally diverse, including many European cathedrals, the Hollywood Bowl, Shea Stadium (home of the New York Mets), and Windsor Castle (a private concert for the Royal Family).
They have joined forces with many famous orchestras, including the LSO, the BBC Concert Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and recently the Cincinnati Pops, with whom they have released a Beatles album on the Telarc label featuring arrangements by one of their original producers, George Martin.
In addition there have been collaborations with many solo musicians, most notably Kiri te Kanawa, George Shearing, Evelyn Glennie, Dudley Moore and even Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys.
These have often resulted in recordings to add to the group's large discography of over 70 albums.
In November this year they undertook a major tour of the USA with the pianist Emanuel Ax. Started in 1968 by six choral scholars from King's College Cambridge, the King's Singers quickly became a prominent musical force in the UK.
The rest of the world soon followed so that today the group's engagements are spread throughout the four corners of the globe.
Since their debut concert the King's Singers have commissioned works from many well-known composers including Krystof Penderecki, Luciano Berio, Peter Maxwell Davies, Ned Rorem and Gyorgy Ligeti.
This branch of their repertoire now comprises well over 100 pieces.
Renowned for their commitment to blend, balance and intonation in
their own performances, they are keen to pass on their knowledge through educational work.
They regularly conduct masterclass courses at the Schleswig Holstein Music Festival and since 1996 have been Prince Consort Ensemble-in-Residence at the Royal College of Music, London.
But above all it is their simple enjoyment of what they do that has captured the imagination of the public all over the world and kept the King's Singers at the top of their game for three and a half decades.
As The Times put it, they are "still unmatched for their musicality and sheer ability to entertain".

They are as equally comfortable performing solo chamber concerts, as they are on folk festival stages, or as guest soloists for symphony orchestras.
Their rare talents and superb musicianship have won them numerous awards for excellence, as well as many invitations for international appearances.

Richie Havens is gifted with one of the most recognizable voices in popular music.
His fiery, poignant, always soulful, singing style has remained unique and ageless since he first emerged from the Greenwich Village folk scene in the early 1960's.
It's a voice that has inspired and electrified audiences from the Woodstock Music 
For three decades, Havens has used his music to convey messages of brotherhood and personal freedom.
With over twenty albums released and a touring schedule that would kill many a younger man, he continues to view his calling as a high one.
As he told The Denver Post, "I really sing songs that move me.
I'm not in show business, I'm in the communications business.
That's what it's about for me".
Janis Ian burst on the scene at age 15 with her controversial saga of interracial love, "Society's Child."
Selfpenned and arranged, it topped the charts and created a storm of discussion that featured Ian on The Tonight Show and in Life, Look, Time and Newsweek.

She achieved a new level of popularity in the 1970s with her trio of masterpieces Stars (1973), Between the Lines (1975) and Aftertones (1976).
The first contained "Jesse" which became a pop standard after Roberta Flack topped the charts with it.
("Everyone thought `Society's Child' was a fluke, and I was a has-been at 18.
`Jesse' proved I was a real writer.")
The second contained "At Seventeen" that sold over a million copies and earned Ian her first two Grammy Awards.
The third was one of the most critically acclaimed albums of its day and featured Ian's friends Odetta and Phoebe Snow as supporting vocalists.
("I didn't stop after Between the Lines; the next album, Aftertones, gave me my first international number one record, and the world shrank.")
She won her next Grammy Award for children's music because of her work on the 1982 album In Harmony 2.
The Recording Academy has also recognized her as a jazz artist by nominating her for a 1981 Grammy with Mel Torme as Best Vocal Duet for their recording of Ian's song "Silly Habits".
Janis Ian has also written and sung radio jingles for such products as McDonald's ("I am the Egg McMuffin"), AT
