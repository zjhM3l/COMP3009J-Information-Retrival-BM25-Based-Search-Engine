Two major Native American digital collections are available online at the Library of Congress' American Memory site: 1.
Edward S. Curtis's The North American Indian, Photographic Images.
Between 1900 and 1930, Edward Curtis traveled throughout the American west, Alaska, and Mexico documenting more than 80 American Indian groups, including the Yu'pik.
His invaluable survey is controversial because, in his enthusiasm to document customs, dress and ceremonies that were falling into disuse, he manipulated his subjects and their surroundings to produce a romanticized view of Indian life.
Over 2,000 of his photographs can be viewed online at American Memory (type Edward Curtis into the search engine): memory.loc.gov For a discussion on Curtis's photographs, see
