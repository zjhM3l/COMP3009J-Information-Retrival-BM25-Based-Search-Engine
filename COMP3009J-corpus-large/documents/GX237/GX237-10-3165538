United States Department of Agriculture Marketing and Regulatory Programs Agricultural Marketing Service Dairy Programs January 2004 Dairy Plants Surveyed and Approved for USDA Grading Service PREFACE The dairy plants listed in this publication are inspected at least twice yearly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Plant approval is determined by unannounced inspections covering more than 100 items, including milk supply, plant facilities, condition of equipment, sanitary practices, and processing procedures.
USDA inspection and grading services are performed under the Regulations in 7 CFR Part 58--Grading and Inspection, General Specifications for Approved Plants and Standards for Grades of Dairy Products administered by the Dairy Grading Branch of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service.
USDA assigns dairy plant approvals using the two following categories: Section I: Plants listed in this section produce products that are manufactured from dairy ingredients meeting the requirements found in the regulations or originate from USDA-approved plants and are therefore eligible for USDA grading or inspection service.
These products are designated by "B," "C," "D," "F," "M," "S" and "W" codes.
Plants listed in this section may have products produced from dairy ingredients that did not originate from USDA-approved plants ("unapproved source plants").
Unapproved source plants are plants that, upon inspection, are found not to meet USDA minimum requirements or plants that do not participate in the voluntary USDA plant inspection program.
In all other respects the plant must meet the same requirements as a Section I plant.
These operations are designated by "P" codes.
The products processed or packaged by these plants are not eligible for USDA grading and inspection service unless they are produced or processed from approved dairy ingredients under continuous USDA inspection.
Section II: Plant approval for grading service does not constitute an endorsement of product quality.
However, such assurance can be achieved by official grading to evaluate the product according to a U.S. grade standard or product specification, or a quality specification of the buyer or seller.
The USDA plant inspection program is widely used by the dairy industry.
Plant managers recognize it as an important means for improving and maintaining a sound operation for producing dairy products that will meet specific grade or contract requirements and that have the uniform quality essential for buyer and consumer approval and protection.
Buyers also find this program a reliable guide to sources of dairy products that have been produced under sanitary and wholesome conditions.
The Dairy Grading Branch also provides grading services under its Resident Grading and Quality Control Program and by request.
Plants using the Resident Grading Program are shown in this publication with an asterisk (*).
This full-time program offers on-the-spot official grading of the plant's manufactured products, laboratory testing, and plant inspection services.
The resident program also makes available to the plant manager the technical knowledge and experience of the Dairy Grading Branch's supervisory staff for help in solving product quality problems.
In addition to these inspection and grading services, the USDA provides a Dairy Equipment Sanitary Design Evaluation Service.
This service provides both fabricators and users a means to assure that the equipment meets all inspection requirements.
USDA fully supports and utilizes the 3-A Sanitary Standards and 3-A Accepted Practices for design evaluations.
In those instances where 3-A Sanitary Standards or 3-A Accepted Practices have not been developed, the USDA Guidelines for the Sanitary Design and Fabrication of Dairy Processing Equipment is the criteria used.
These services are available on a voluntary basis, and fees are charged to cover costs.
Managers of dairy plants and other interested persons may obtain information about these services by contacting the Washington Staff or the National Field Office.
A listing of staff persons to be contacted for additional information is provided at the end of this publication.
Plants listed in this publication are identified by State-assigned code numbers (where available) in accordance with the national uniform coding system known as FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards).
This State-assigned identification precedes the plant name listing.
Each State has also been assigned a two-digit number which appears in this publication before the name of the State.
This publication is revised every three months to reflect changes in plant approval codes and to include new plants.
This and other publications are available by contacting the Dairy Grading Branch or from our home page at http://www.ams.usda.gov/dairy/grade.htm.

PRODUCTS PROCESSED OR PACKAGED BY THESE PLANTS MAY BE PRODUCED FROM DAIRY INGREDIENTS WHICH DID NOT ORIGINATE IN PLANTS APPROVED BY USDA.
THESE PRODUCTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR USDA GRADING AND INSPECTION SERVICE ONLY WHEN PRODUCED UNDER CONTINUOUS USDA INSPECTION SECTION II Plants listed in this section may have products produced from dairy ingredients that did not originate from USDA-approved plants ("unapproved source plants").
Unapproved source plants are plants that, upon inspection, are found not to meet USDA minimum requirements or plants that do not participate in the voluntary USDA plant inspection program.
In all other respects the plant must meet the same requirements as a Section I plant.
These operations are designated by "P" codes.
The products processed or packaged by these plants are not eligible for USDA grading and inspection service unless they are produced or processed from approved dairy ingredients under continuous USDA inspection.
The two requirements of continuous inspection and usage of ingredients from USDAapproved plants must be satisfied in order for production from a "P" code plant to be used in products made in USDA-approved plants listed in Section I.
A USDA certificate must be issued to accompany product produced in a "P" code plant to show that the product meets these two requirements and may therefore be used in products produced by plants listed in Section I. 28 Plants in Section II approved for codes marked with a single asterisk (*) are subscribing to the USDA Salmonella Surveillance Program.
This program monitors plant control by quarterly USDA sampling and testing of environmental samples only, together with an established system of follow-up in the event of a positive result.
This Salmonella Surveillance Program is limited to the testing of only environmental samples whenever the products manufactured by a "P" code plant are produced with dairy ingredients from unapproved source plants.
Plant management may request Salmonella analysis of a plant's "P" code production, provided it has been produced under continuous USDA inspection.
While this USDA monitoring implies a certain degree of safety, the relatively low level of official testing does not ensure the absence of Salmonella organisms in products manufactured in USDA-approved plants.
