[USEMAP:LRL-plain-banner.jpg] Last edited October 2003 Resources on Minnesota Issues Public Welfare This guide is compiled by staff at the Minnesota Legislative Reference Library on a topic of interest to Minnesota legislators.
It is designed to provide an introduction to the topic, directing the user to a variety of sources, and is not intended to be exhaustive.
In particular, it is focused on items available in the Legislative Reference Library.
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 eliminated AFDC and replaced it with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.
TANF differs from AFDC in that it gives each state a block grant that is used to provide cash assistance to needy families and in that it sets a time limit of sixty months for receiving cash assistance.
Another component of TANF is a work requirement: adults receiving TANF are required to spend a specified amount of time engaged in work or work activities, such as seeking employment or on-the-job training.
In order to comply with the federal law, policymakers in each state updated their welfare laws and developed a State TANF Plan.
Minnesota's welfare program, the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP), was signed into law by the governor on April 30, 1997.
(Laws of Minnesota 1997, chapter 85).
Begun as a demonstration project in 1994, the MFIP was fully implemented as of July 1, 1998.
Families first began reaching the 60-month time limit in July 2002.
Chapter 14 of the 2003 special session made a number of modifications to Minnesota's welfare law, including the elimination of increases in cash assistance if families have additional children while on welfare; restrictions on what types of food may be bought with food stamps; adding additional work requirements; and imposing sanctions for those breaking work requirements.
Another change made by this law counts SSI and housing allowances as unearned income, reducing welfare payments accordingly.
On June 28, 2003, a class-action lawsuit was filed on behalf of those receiving payment cuts, alleging that state officials did not receive the necessary federal waivers to make cuts in state welfare payments; on June 30, 2003, a Ramsey County District judge issued a restraining order to temporarily block the cuts.
While the USDA later approved the state cuts, the class-action lawsuit has proceeded.
Information on this program and on other welfare initiatives in Minnesota and in other states is available at the Legislative Reference Library.
