A method for detecting an interruption of an identification response from a transponder device that communicates with a model railroad layout and generating an alarm output condition, comprising the steps of:
providing said transponder device (11) for producing said identification response,
establishing a communication between said transponder device and said model railroad layout (4),
providing at least one transponder detecting device including decoding logic means (9),
configuring said decoding logic means to automatically monitor and track said identification response of said transponder device, and to generate said alarm output condition after a predetermined criteria for loss of detection has occurred, and
