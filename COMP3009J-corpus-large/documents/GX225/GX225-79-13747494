Exact Date: 12/29/1987 Topic/Subject: The first presenter in "Impeachment Proceedings," Dagmar Hamilton, distinguishes the proceedings of the House Judiciary Committee from the investigations by the special prosecutor and the Committee On Presidential Campaign Activities (Senate Watergate Committee) and gives special attention to Article II, concerning abuse of power, among the five articles of impeachment.
The second presenter, Terry Sullivan, evaluates the following three characterizations about the impeachment process using head-count data from the majority leader's office: support for impeachment among members of Congress built up over time, members of Congress became concerned about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, and the system of checks and balances worked.
Sullivan's address is followed by comments from discussants John Doar, Elizabeth Holtzman, and Judge Charles Wiggins.
Doar discusses considerations involved in presenting information to the Judiciary Committee and how the committee defined impeachable offenses.
Holtzman consentrates on the decision of the Speaker of the House to choose the Judiciary Committee to conduct impeachment hearings, the attitude of committee members toward the proceedings, the decision to televise the proceedings, the definition of impeachment, and the committee's failure to pass an article of impeachment on thebombing of Cambodia.
Judge Charles Wiggins examines the historical antecedents to the doctrine of impeachment, its rejection of a standard for abuse of power, and evidence for articles of impeachment I (obstruction of justice), II (abuse of power), and III (refusal to respond to congressional subpoenas).
Questions from the audience follow both sessions.
