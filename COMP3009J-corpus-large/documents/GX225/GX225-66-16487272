Mineral Information Institute STONE Crushed Stone 
Crushed stone is any type of rock material that is crushed to any of a variety of sizes.
The most common types of stone processed into crushed stone include limestone and dolomite (70% of all crushed stone), granite (16%), and traprock (7%).
Smaller amounts of marble, slate, sandstone, quartzite, and volcanic cinder are also used.
Together, these rocks represent only 7% of annual crushed rock production.
Dimension stone is any type of natural rock material that is quarried in order to make blocks or slabs of rock that are cut to specific sizes (width, length, and thickness) and shapes.
Dimension stone is used because it is durable, strong and attractive.
It is usually important that they can be polished.
The rocks chosen for dimension stone include all rock types (igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary).
The most important rocks used as dimension stone are granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, and slate.
Certain softer rocks such as alabaster (massive gypsum) and soapstone (massive talc) can also be considered dimension stone.
Sources
Crushed stone is produced in 49 states in the U.S.
As can be expected, the crushed stone from any particular state depends on the general geology and rocks of that state.
For instance, crushed limestone and dolomite is typical of New York State, marble and granite from Vermont, etc.
Even though it is quarried and processed all over the United States, a small number of states account for more than 50% of the total crushed stone production.
These states, in decreasing order of amount of stone produced, are Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee.
In addition to quarried and crushed stone, significant amounts of crushed stone are recycled and more is imported.
Most states are now recycling asphalt and crushed rock roadways as well as concrete roads and structures by crushing these materials and using them in new road construction projects.
The U.S. does import significant amounts of crushed stone as well.
Most is imported from Canada (53%), followed by Mexico (30%), The Bahamas (9%), and other countries (8%).
Crushed stone resources worldwide are very, very large.
Nearly endless quantities of all types of rock (igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary) are available for crushed stone production.
However, high-quality stone, such as some limestone and dolomite used for very special purposes, are more limited to specific regions.
More than 130 companies in 33 states produce dimension stone.
The states producing the most dimension stone are, in decreasing order of production, Indiana, Vermont, Georgia, and Wisconsin.
Based on tonnage, granite accounts for the largest amount of dimension stone production each year (37%).
Limestone production is next (33%), sandstone (16%), quartzite (4%), marble (3%), slate (3%), and miscellaneous stone (4%).
Dimension stone is also imported.
It is imported from Italy (42%), India (12%), Canada (12%), Spain (10%), and other nations (24%).
The overall supplies of dimension stone are enough to meet annual demand.
Specific deposits of dimension stone with particular characteristics can be limited and eventually quarried out.
Uses
Crushed stone is used mostly for road construction and maintenance.
It is also used for chemical production, for making cement and lime, and in agriculture.
There are a large number of other uses for crushed stone, many of which are not accurately or completely reported.
Dimension stone is quarried in large, rough blocks of stone, each of which weighs many tons.
This rough block production represents 55% of the dimension stone produced annually.
Rough blocks of various dimension stone are used mostly in construction (51%) and to make monuments (20%).
The remainder is used to make curbstones for streets, flagstones for roofs and walkways, and other decorative uses such as for carvings and statues.
Substitutes and Alternative Sources
Stone resources in the world are large which guarantees crushed stone should never be in short supply.
However, if necessary, a small number of materials can be used in place of crushed stone.
Possible substitutes are sand, gravel, expanded clay, shale, perlite and vermiculite.
Depending on the situation, dimension stone can be replaced with steel, concrete, plastics, glass and other similar materials.
In building or monument construction, for instance, the material chosen very much depends on the design choices and goals of the architect.
A particular stone might be chosen for its color and texture, or for the look it gives to a building or a room.
Such decisions can use any number of building materials.
