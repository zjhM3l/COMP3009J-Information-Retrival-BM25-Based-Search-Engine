South Florida Water Management District Page 1 FINAL DRAFT WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES FOR THE EVERGLADES ALTERNATIVE COMBINATIONS FOR THE FEEDER CANAL BASIN February 27, 2002 SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT West Palm Beach, Florida Please contact Damon Meiers (dmeiers@sfwmd.gov) at 1-800-432-2045 x 6876 with comments or questions Alternatives for the Feeder Canal Basin Final Draft February 27, 2002 South Florida Water Management District INTRODUCTION Page 2 The Feeder Canal Basin is an area of approximately 113 square miles located in Hendry County.
A map of the Basin is presented in Figure 1.
The canals and structures within this Basin provide flood protection and drainage in addition to conveying excess runoff to Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA 3A) for water supply and environmental use.
The two major canals associated with the Feeder Canal Basin are the North Feeder Canal, and the West Feeder Canal.
These two canals merge in the lower southeastern corner of the basin and discharge south through the S-190 structure and into the L-28 Interceptor Canal.
The L-28 Interceptor Canal, the West Feeder Canal and the North Feeder Canal are located west of L-28 and provide drainage for the western portion of the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation, plus privately owned agricultural land lying north and west of the Reservation.
The southeast terminus of the L-28 Interceptor Canal levee eventually joins the southern extreme of the L-28 levee adjacent to the WCA 3A.
A 100 foot earthen plug in the L-28 Interceptor Canal prevents the surface water in L-28 and L-28 Interceptor Canal from mixing.
Two secondary canals also exist in the Feeder Canal Basin.
They are located upstream of the West Feeder Canal.
The Lard Can Canal runs north to south and joins the Wingate Mill Canal which flows west to east at the southern boundary of the Basin.
This flow moves southeast to the 280 foot wide West Weir and into the West Feeder Canal which bisects the western side of the Seminole Big Cypress Reservation terminating at the North Feeder Canal.
The primary discharge structure in this basin is the S-190 gated spillway about 1/3 mile south of this North and West Feeder juncture.
The northwest section of the Seminole Big Cypress Indian Reservation (17,500 acres) comprises nearly 25% of this Feeder Canal Basin.
MAJOR SOURCE CONTROL PROJECT PRESENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION: McDaniel Ranch is a private landowner, whose holding consists of 34.5 sections of land and is the primary contributor of surface water run-off to the North Feeder Canal.
It has been a source of some of the highest phosphorus concentrations in surface water flows in the basin.
McDaniel Ranch was issued a surface water management Master Permit by the South Florida Water Management District.
Construction of the system will be complete by the year 2006 and is expected to meet the 50 ppb phosphorus concentration required by the Seminole Tribe of Florida and McDaniel Landowner's Agreement.
The system consists of several detention areas and pre-treatment areas designed to improve surface water quality before discharge off-site.
The detention areas are comprised of approximately 6,000 acres and pre-treatment areas consist of approximately 2,000 acres.
The expected storage area/volume for the project is at least 6,000 acre-feet.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH FLORIDA RESTORATION CRITICAL PROJECT: The 52,000 acre Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation lies directly north of the Big Cypress National Preserve and west of the Water Conservation Area 3A and thus is considered an integral component in the south Florida restoration program.
A part of this restoration is the Seminole Tribe Big Cypress Reservation Water Conservation Plan (WCP) designed in two phases.
Both phases are funded in part by the USACOE as the largest of the Federal Critical Restoration Projects and authorized by Section 528 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1996.
Alternatives for the Feeder Canal Basin Final Draft February 27, 2002 South Florida Water Management District Page 3 Phase I is the construction of the East Main Conveyance Canal on the east side of the Seminole Reservation and is schedule for completion by January 2003.
This Project ensures the delivery of the Tribe's established entitlement of water (47,000 acre-feet/year) via the recently constructed S-409 pump station located at the L3/L4 pool known as Confusion Corner within the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation.
See Appendix B for map of the project.
Phase II of the Conceptual Plan, is designed to improve water quality, wetland restoration and water conveyance capacity in this basin by enhancing existing wetlands through rehydration, transitioning existing poor quality uplands to functioning wetland habitat and establishing water detention cells as flood control.
The completion date for Phase II is scheduled for September 2005.
The Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation's total land area is approximately 52,000 acres.
However, within the entire Water Conservation System Project Area only the western sub-basins, or 10,090 acres are included in the Feeder Canal Basin.
Of this amount 7,998 are contributing drainage areas and 2,092 are treatment areas (this number will increase to 2,493 acres when the removal of dikes and ditches is considered).
These `treatment areas' include four (4) Water Resource Areas comprising 1,425 acres, fourteen (14) Irrigation Cells and one (1) Stormwater Attenuation Cell.
The expected storage area/volume for the total WCP is 5,270 acre-feet.
Water Resource Areas are designed to hold 1 foot of water for 9 months, Irrigation Cells 3-4 feet of water for 6 months and Stormwater Attenuation Cells at 3 feet dependent upon rainfall.
It is expected that the TP concentration removal within these systems will be dependent on the treatment area, depth of water and retention times as estimated but will meet the 50 ppb phosphorus concentration as expressed in the USACOE permit (199800622 IP-SS).
CERP PROJECTS IN FEEDER CANAL BASIN: The Big Cypress/L-28 Interceptor Modifications Project is scheduled to be completed in June 2015.
The Project incorporates both flow diversion and STAs designed to work in conjunction with the Tribe's Water Conservation Plan.
Current canal water flows in the West and North Feeder canals upstream from structure S-190 will be modified to surface water sheetfow south across the Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP), downstream of the Seminole Tribe's Big Cypress Indian Reservation, using three (3) pump stations (WRA-1 @250 cfs, WRA-2 @ 500 cfs and WRA-3 @750 cfs) and a spreader canal system.
Additionally, S-190 would be converted from a gated structure to a pump station to maintain upstream flood protection.
After conversion to a pump station of 1460 cfs from its existing 2960 cfs, the S-190 will push flows south into the L-28 Interceptor Canal (the western boundary of the L-28 Basin) where sheetflow will also be re-established with the backfilling and degradation of the southwest L-28 Interceptor Canal levee.
Mullet Slough, located south of the Feeder Canal Basin, is expected to influence the direction of this sheetflow to the southeast and eventually into the WCA 3A.
Decreases of pollutant loading are expected to the western portion of WCA-3A and the downstream Everglades Alternatives for the Feeder Canal Basin Final Draft February 27, 2002 South Florida Water Management District Page 4 National Park from a reduction of the 31 year average flow of 89,300 acre-feet/year directly to the WCA-3A to the 2050 base condition of overland sheetflow only.
Additionally, two STAs would be constructed adjacent to the West and North Feeder Canals to treat storm water runoff from upstream basins prior to entering the Seminole Tribe's North Feeder Canal.
These two STAs, an 1,100 acre STA adjacent to the North Feeder Canal (4,400 acre-feet storage volume) and an 800 acre STA adjacent to the West Feeder Canal (3,200 acre-feet storage volume) are sized to reduce TP and other pollutant loads to the BCNP, the Miccosukee Tribe Reservation and ultimately WCA-3A, to assure compliance with applicable water quality standards in the receiving waterbodies.
Historic flow and water quality data from the S-190 pump structure were compiled to generate the Baseline data set (DBKEY 15987).
The simulated flow and phosphorus data for this structure for the 31-year period (1965-1995) are presented in Figure 2.

To develop the baseline flows, the SFWMM was used to simulate current operational conditions and utilized rainfall for the 31-year period between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1995.
The goal was not to recreate the 31-year period of record flows, but rather, to simulate the expected hydrologic response in the basin as a result of the 31-year rainfall history.
For the water quality component, a regression relationship was developed between flow and phosphorus concentration.
The resulting regression equation was applied to the simulated flows to create the 31-year period of Baseline flow and water quality data.
Reference: Baseline Data for the Basin-Specific Feasibility Studies to Achieve the Long-term Water Quality Goals for the Everglades, SFWMD, May 2001.
The summary of the 31-year period of Baseline data at S-190 yields average annual simulated flows of 77,179 acre-feet and TP loads of 14.854 metric tons.
The flowweighted mean TP concentration is 156 ppb.
