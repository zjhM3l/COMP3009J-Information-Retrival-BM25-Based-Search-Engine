In Kabul, a friendly government is now an essential member of the coalition against terror."
President George W. Bush March 11, 2002 "Our shared goal is to help the Afghan people rebuild a politically stable, economically viable, secure Afghanistan.
An Afghanistan where terrorism and traffickers can never again flourish, an Afghanistan to which refugees will want to return, an Afghanistan whose sons and daughters can contribute fully to the life of their nation and to the world."

Andrew S. Natsios I am pleased to provide you with the latest report on the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) on-going efforts to rebuild Afghanistan.
We have been flooded in recent months with requests for information on the status of U.S. humanitarian relief and reconstruction programs to assist in the rebuilding of this devastated nation.
This report outlines our assistance to the people of Afghanistan to rehabilitate agriculture, enhance education, improve health, and create jobs.
furthermore, the United States is strengthening institutions, rebuilding infrastructure, restoring media and empowering women..
The U.S. government is committed to building a brighter future for Afghanistan's people, particularly women and children, who for years were denied basic human rights of health, education and personal liberty.
From the beginning, our goal has been to approach the challenges Afghanistan presents in a strategic fashion, combining our emergency, transitional and medium-term programs in a manner that contributes directly to our longterm objective of sustained economic growth and development.
Equally important is our commitment to support and strengthen the new central government of Afghanistan.
We continue to work closely with its leaders and will adjust our assistance to new conditions as they emerge.
Rebuilding the country is an immense undertaking that the Afghan people and their new government are confronting with great energy.
President Bush and Secretary Powell have instructed me to make USAID support for Afghan reconstruction our top priority.
As President Bush said, "...for the first time since 1979, an American flag was raised over the U.S. Agency for International Development's Mission in Kabul.
That flag will not be lowered.
It will wave long into the future, a symbol of America's commitment to Afghanistan's future."

ful future for the people of Afghanistan.
USAID has made historic efforts to deliver critically needed assistance to the Afghan people.
Even before Sept. 11, 2001, Afghanistan was the United States' top recipient of humanitarian aid, receiving $174 million in fiscal year 2001 before the September terrorist attacks.
Since the attacks, the United States has continued to play a leading role in meeting the Afghans' urgent needs for food, water, shelter and medicine.
The delivery of unprecedented amounts of food in record time by the U.N. World Food Program (WFP), with funding from USAID, has greatly reduced the loss of life.
The majority of the wheat, oil and lentils came from the United States and has fed more than 9 million men, women and children.
The United States has pledged nearly $300 million in fiscal year 2002 for Afghan relief and managed by USAID.
With the demise of the Taliban and the establishment of the new government of Afghanistan, Afghanistan is beginning to focus on recovery and reconstruction, even as the drought continues.
While humanitarian relief is still required, USAID is increasing reconstruction efforts.
USAID has outlined four goals for reconstruction: 1) restoring food security and revitalizing agriculture and other livelihood options; 2) rebuilding the devastated educational system; 3) improving health; and 4) strengthening Afghan institutions to assure long-term stability.
Of these, agriculture is a cornerstone of sustainable development.
USAID is working with the government of Afghanistan, humanitarian organizations and the rest of the international community to begin the process of building a safe, stable society that meets the needs of its people and eliminates an environment that breeds terrorism.
s Years of civil war, compounded by Taliban rule and the worst drought in memory, have devastated the country.
Approximately half of Afghanistan's 26.8 million people live in absolute poverty.
Malnutrition is widespread.
Fifty percent of the people are unemployed--70 percent are illiterate.
The systematic human rights assaults under the Taliban curtailed female access to education, healthcare and livelihoods, depriving women of the means to support themselves and their families.
Virtually all of the country's institutions and much of its infrastructure have been destroyed.
Such an environment, if left untended, provides a fertile breeding ground for terrorism and other destabilizing movements.
To support the war on terrorism and to keep with America's tradition of assisting those in need, USAID has made a major commitment to help build a hope- J udy B enjamin/USAID A new day is dawning for Afghan girls and women.

Afghans hold two of 30,000 radios supplied by USAID and the International Organization for Migration that enable them to hear news and bulletins concerning food distribution, humanitarian aid and security.
Under the Taliban regime, people were forbidden to listen to music.
News and information were tightly controlled, and communities were isolated.
USAID is working with the Afghan government and other Afghan and international organizations to rebuild communications and journalistic capacity with the goal of informing and uniting Afghanistan's people to help produce a peaceful, stable, and viable political transition and administration.
USAID is supporting a broad range of media activities to provide news and information.

T he situation of women in Afghanistan has improved markedly since the fall of the Taliban, but much work remains.
Despite 23 years of war, Afghan urban women enjoyed a long history of freedom and education before the Taliban assumed power in 1996.
Women were deans of universities, government ministers and members of the country's highest legislative body.
During the Taliban regime, urban Afghan women were shunned from public life, often prohibited from working outside the home, and often punished for showing their faces.
Education, both traditional and vocational, was forbidden.
The rates of depression and trauma-related illnesses among women living under Taliban rule were among the highest in the world.
A great number of highly educated, skilled women fled the country during the last decade.
USAID is committed to helping the Afghan government build a nation where women have the freedom and the resources to pursue an education and a livelihood.

Women are returning to the university and have a newly rehabilitated dormitory in which to live and study.
More women now have access to health clinics even though many more clinics and trained health staff are needed along with medicines, medical equipment and supplies.
Women still have poorer health than men.
Fifty percent of pregnant women are anemic, causing next to the highest maternal mortality in the world.
Seventy percent of the cases of tuberculosis are women.

USAID funded the establishment of a women's resource center in the ministry, which offers Internet access and computer training and includes a library of print and video material on women's rights and women's health in Dari, Pashto and English.
USAID and IOM have rehabilitated the training center of Ariana, a national women's NGO that provides education and vocational courses to women and girls.
The USAID-funded Afghan Women's Network (AWN) is providing returning refugees with job skills, including managerial training, to enhance women's abilities to achieve economic independence.
AWN trained women to participate in the Loya Jirga.
In addition to these specific initiatives, USAID's entire reconstruction program for Afghanistan emphasizes women's participation and benefit.
