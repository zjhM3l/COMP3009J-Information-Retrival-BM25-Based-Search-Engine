T HE MINERAL INDUSTRY OF ICELAND By Jozef Plachy The mineral industry of Iceland, owing to abundant hydroelectric and geothermal energy and lack of indigenous resources, was largely composed of metal production from imported raw materials.
Nearly all production of aluminum and ferrosilicon was exported.
However, all production of industrial minerals, with the exception of diatomite, was used by local industries.
According to latest revision, foreign investment in the mineral industry, with the exception of energy, was encouraged; however, it was subject to sector-specific legislation.
The majority of founders of any joint company must be residents of Iceland.
All board members must be citizens and, while a company could acquire real estate, it was not allowed to exploit natural resources.2 Following the trend of other European countries, Iceland was undertaking privatization of Government-owned enterprises.
As a first step, a holding company was created, with a board of directors entrusted with decision-making accountability.
While the production of commodities for domestic consumption remained about the same, export-oriented production of metals and pumice was beneficially influenced by the improved economic situation of European countries.
(See table 1.)
Owing to the trade agreement and geographical proximity to the European Union, most of Iceland's trade was with Europe.
The exports of aluminum, diatomite, and ferrosilicon constituted about 12% of the value of Iceland's total exports.3 Most of the shares in the major mineral industry enterprises in 1994 were still held by the Government.
The remainder were either foreign-owned and locally operated or, for smaller businesses, locally owned and operated.
(See table 2.)
In 1994, Islenzka Alfelagid hf-Icelandic Aluminum Co. Ltd.
(ISAL) was the only manufacturer of aluminum metal from alumina imported mainly from Australia.
The 99,500metric-ton-per-year (mt/a) capacity smelter at Straumsvik near Hafnarfjordur, 17 kilometers (km) southwest of Reykjavik, was owned by Alusuisse-Lonza Holding Ltd. of Switzerland and employed about 435 people.4 According to ISAL, production of primary aluminum has been steadily increasing, reaching about 99,300 metric tons (mt) in 1994.
The Iselska jarnblendifelagid hf-Icelandic Alloys Ltd. at Grundartangi, 25 km north of Reykjavik, had two 30megawatt semiclosed three-phase submerged-arc furnaces 1
designed for production of 75% ferrosilicon and employed about 155 people.5 Raw materials (3.5 mt per ton of ferrosilicon) were transformed from the local harbor to storage by conveyor belt, while finished ferrosilicon ingots were hauled by trucks.
The fumes were cooled and filtered and the resulting byproduct, microsilica, was used by a nearby cement plant as an additive.
The 1994 production of about 66,000 mt was slightly lower than in 1993, due to a burnthrough of Furnace 1, interrupting production for more than 2 months.6 On January 1, 1994, the state-owned Sementsverksmidja Rikisins hf (State Cement Works) became a Limited Company.
The 38-year-old plant in Akranes, on the north side of Hvalfjordur, 22 km north of Reykjavik, employed about 115 people.7 Due to a lack of limestone, it used sea shells, rhyolite, other indigenous materials, and imported gypsum.
The 1994 production was 80,856 mt, a slight decline from the previous year.8 The entire production of diatomite was supplied by Kisilidjan hf (Diatomite Plant Ltd.) in Myvatnssveit, in the northwestern part of the country, near Lake Myvatn.
During the summer months, when the lake is not frozen, the diatomaceous earth was pumped from the bottom of the lake and dried in kilns, using geothermal energy, to 99% solid matter.
A production license has been extended until the year 2010 but restricted to specific areas of the lake because of adverse effects on sediment displacement.
After the present deposit is exhausted, the operation was expected to transfer to the nearby Bolir-area where reserves were estimated to last for decades.9 All production of pumice was concentrated around Mount Hekla, 110 km east of Reykjavik.
The 28-million-cubicmeter deposit was formed during a volcanic eruption in 1104.
The density of the dry, loose pumice was 320 kilograms per cubic meter, suitable for light concrete and building blocks.
The largest quarry was operated by Eldber hf, a joint venture of Iceland's Jardenfnaidnadur hf and Unternehmensbeteiligungen GmbH of Germany.
The pumice is 4 meters (m) to 6 m thick, covered with an overburden of a maximum of 1 m. A large order by a German partner caused an increase in the annual production of pumice in Iceland from an estimated 45,000 mt in 1993 to about 230,000 mt in 1994.
Rhyolite, with a silicon content of about 65%, was quarried in the Hvalfjordur District and trucked to a cement 371
plant 35 km away.
In 1994, 16,400 mt was produced, all used to manufacture cement.10 Salt was produced from seawater extracted from an underground reservoir at a depth of about 1,500 m by Icelandic Salt Co.
The resulting salt had a high concentration of potassium and magnesium compounds with a low sodium level.
Most of the 1994 sand production, which originated from calcareous sea shells, was used to manufacture cement.
On the seabed of Faxafloi, at a depth of 30 m to 35 m, lies a commercial concentration of shell sand.
It had a calcium carbonate content of more than 90%.
Production was by dredging and pumping to shore, 10 km to 18 km away.11 The known mineral reserves of Iceland consisted solely of industrial minerals, mainly construction materials.
(See table 3.)
All of Iceland's major cities were on the coast, mainly in the western part of the country, around the capital, Reykjavik.
Consequently, most of the 11,543 km of road were in western Iceland.
Iceland was heavily dependent on sea transportation, boasting about 70 ports.
In addition to Reykjavik, which accounts for 60% of imports and 30% of exports, they include well-equipped ports in Akureyri, Grundartangi, Hafnarfjordur, Keflavik, Seydisfjordur, Siglufjordur, Straumsvik, and Thorlakshofn.
The merchant marine had 10 ships totaling 53,037 deadweight tons.
It included three cargo, three refrigerated cargo, two roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, one oil tanker, and one chemical tanker.
Iceland's future industrial development depended on utilizing its abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power.
The total potential for electric production from hydro and geothermal power was estimated at 50,000 gigawatt hours per year.
Since only about 10% of the potential energy was
being harnessed, the Government continued to encourage foreign investment in energy intensive industry, despite a lack of raw materials.
Future plans included constructing a 210,000-mt/a capacity aluminum smelter, exporting electric power to Western Europe, and developing spar and perlite deposits.
