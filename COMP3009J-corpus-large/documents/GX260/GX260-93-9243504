DATE ISSUED: ATTENTION: SUBJECT: SUMMARY Issues: 1) 2) Should the City Council authorize the City Manager to enter into an agreement with Qualcomm Incorporated for naming rights? Should the City Council authorize the City Manager to enter into the First Supplement to the 1995 Agreement for the Partial Use and Occupancy of the San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium with the Chargers Football Company?

C) -18398 Other Recommendations - The San Diego County Taxpayers Association has reviewed this proposal and released its report on March 3 endorsing the agreement with Qualcomm.
Fiscal Impact - The agreement with Qualcomm provides $18 million to complete the improvements at the Stadium.
In addition, Qualcomm has agreed to purchase 268 general admission season tickets for a five-year period.
The $18 million contribution from Qualcomm eliminates the need to issue additional debt for the Stadium Improvements and saves the City $34 million in interest payments.
The agreement with the Chargers provides for the Chargers to pay the City a total of $3.5 million over the next 10 years.
The Chargers also have agreed to waive their rights to the revenue from the naming rights agreement with Qualcomm.
This revenue would have been $19.6 million if the naming rights revenue were paid to the Chargers annually over the next 20 years based upon the current advertising and signage agreements.
In addition, the Chargers have agreed to provide a skybox suite to Qualcomm for a 20-year period.

The Padres want exclusive rights to bring a major league soccer franchise to the stadium.

Additional Income - Taxpayers Association Assumptions In reviewing the City's projected revenues, the San Diego County Taxpayers Association suggested that revenues could be increased in the special events area after the end of the Padres current lease term.
