Tiled Display (LCD tiles for high resolution, or plasma screens) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Tiled LCD Display Â· Treat tiled display as a large digital "corkboard" on which information can be posted permanently for long term collaborative work.
Â· SpaceGlider as a remote control of all Continuum displays as if one big screen.
Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Iterative Design Studies of using the Continuum for Intensive Collaborative Work Â· Iterative improvement of 2 networked Continuum spaces.
Â· Observe and explore design issues for interaction of lots of displays and multiple simultaneous inputs.
Â· Observe how display-rich environments affect group awareness and parallelism in distance collaborations.
Â· Provide Access Grid community with an understanding of how people might work as the AG begins to bring in more than just video conferencing.

Overview of Study Methods Â· 1 pilot study and 4 iterative design studies with system configuration variations.
Â· 19 students (all subjects participated in two studies).
Â· A group of 3~4 students was distributed in 2 Continuum spaces and performed a set of collaborative scientific tasks: Â­ Web-based search and information fusion.
Â­ Information visualization of multivariate statistical data.
Â­ Collaborative brainstorming and design.
Â· Measurements Â­ Observational notes; Video recording; Pre- and Post- test survey; Group interview; Data logging on computer usage.

Pilot Study Â· A group of 3 students performing 3 collaborative tasks: concentration game, info search, and info viz Â· System Configuration (Day1 Â­ Distributed) Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ Â­ A S P S 1 ccess Grid hared Whiteboard via NetMeeting rojection Display 
Â· System Configuration (Day2 Â­ Co-located) Whiteboard Projection Display 
Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Observations Â­ Pilot Study Usage Patterns of Continuum Technologies Â· Sense of ownership for the resources (e.g. grab and use different tile for individual workspaces - visual access to all the workspaces but input access was not shared) Â· Tiled display offered multiple individual workspaces while maintaining necessary awareness between distributed users; useful for multiple linked views and side-by-side comparison Â· Need to provide individual input per user for parallel work.
Â· Projection display used 1~2 times when students wanted to examine the patterns of data in a bigger format in info viz; Shared touch screen was used only for recording answers Â· Treat Continuum's displays as one big screen (e.g. cut-andpaste); Flexible tiled display that can project up to single large high-resolution data visualization

Design Study 1 : Â· System Configuration
Enhancing the Continuum to support the illusion of seamless displays
Â­ Access Grid (4 camera sources 
TD
AG
WB
Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Observations Â­ Design Study 1 Â· Wanted more microphones and cameras in mini-AG setting! Â· Shared whiteboard conflicts between remote participants Â· Shared tiled display (distributed corkboard mechanism) Â­ Casual glancing over at others (e.g. to get search strategy) Â­ But, not supported awareness of group task progress Â· SpaceGlider mouse sharing problem Â­ Mouse identification 
Introducing Tablet PC for individual input control and Improving mini-AG setting
Design Study 2 :
Â· System Configuration Â­ Access Grid (4 camera sources 
Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Observations Â­ Design Study 2 Â· Improved mini-AG setting helped increase interaction between remote users; But, users suggested reducing video sources Â· Shared whiteboard conflicts; conflict resolution using video Â· Shared tiled display (as workspaces for remote collaboration) Â· Tablet PCs (as personal workspaces) Â­ Reduced users' casual glancing on the shared tiled display Â· SpaceGlider mouse sharing problem Â· Users felt no continuity of the workspace (due to SpaceGlider connecting between TD and WB) Â· Data transfer between displays Â­ Cut-and-paste; Move the window from one display to another; Read-and-write collaboration (via voice channel) Â­ Using Tablet PC to transfer notes from TD to WB Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Enhancing the Continuum to support the flexible shared workspace for easy transition between individual work and group work
Design Study 3 :
Â· System Configuration Â­ Access Grid (4 camera sources 
Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Observations Â­ Design Study 3 Â· Increased number of overhear/help/collaboration between remote users over AG (may because of user's second time use of the system); Better performance (time 
Design Study 4 :
Evaluating a presentation model for the shared workspace
Â· System Configuration Â­ Access Grid (4 camera sources 
Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Observations Â­ Design Study 4 Â· Performance degraded as compared to Study3 groups.
Â· More two local pairs collaborative work 
Â­ `Show me' pattern (e.g. one asked another to show your workspace or one informed others about showing my workspace) Â­ Wanted the shared tiled display (distributed corkboard model) back! Â· Tablet PCs (as individual workspaces) Â· Liked Switcher against SpaceGlider Â· Data transfer between displays (e.g. cut-and-paste) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago

Discussion : Task Parallelism and Group Awareness Â· Task Parallelism Â­ Number of input controls (one per site vs. one per user) Â­ Task types (Mixed-mode vs. tightly coupled collaboration) Â­ Group working styles (work together vs. divided work) Â­ Need awareness support when user's working in parallel Â· Group Awareness Â­ SpaceGlider mouse identification -
Â­ Overhearing between remote users and displaying spatiality of human interaction over AG.

Discussion : Video Conferencing and Multi-users Shared Input Control Â· Video Conferencing Â­ Audio! (collaboration halt by audio fails and repair by using text chat) Â­ Video sources (how to position camera? one collaborator wide-angle close-up view; additional views of shared resources for conveying spatial references) Â­ A group as a whole used all video sources.
Â­ Video source placement issue Â­ need to be explored Â· Multi-users Shared Input Control Â­ SpaceGlider mouse sharing problem (accidental intrusion) Â­ Give turn-taking protocol instead of Take for SpaceGlider? Â­ Switcher is good for multiple users' sharing resources Â­ A sense of ownership for the shared resources when using Switcher Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Discussion : Private/Public Workspace and Display-rich Environment UI Â· Private and Public Workspace Â­ Public workspace (e.g. Shared WB, Shared tiled display) provides information fully visible and supports awareness Â­ Personal workspace (e.g. TabletPC) Â­ Private to public mechanism (i.e. Presentation model) was not good for Continuum's tiled display setting Â­ Some users requested private (not shared) workspace, mainly for email.
Â· Display-rich Environment User Interface Â­ One continuous display (e.g. cut-and-paste, moving the window from one display to another, SpaceGlider) Â­ Used various channels (e.g. Tablet/paper, shared notes, verbal) to move data between displays Â­ Proximity of displays (e.g. putting them closer together) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
Conclusion Â· Iterative design studies with the technology variations Â­ SpaceGlider vs. Switcher (multi-user shared input control) Â­ Screen-less keyboard/mouse vs. Tablet PC (proximity of display) Â­ Shared tiled display (distributed corkboard model) vs. Flexible shared tiled display vs. Presentation-model tiled display (power-point presentation mechanism) Â· Shared tiled display (distributed corkboard mechanism) Â­ Supported parallel work and group awareness between distributed sites Â­ used for multiple linked views and side-by-side comparison Â· Explored design issues for display-rich environment user interface and advanced awareness tool Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) University of Illinois at Chicago
