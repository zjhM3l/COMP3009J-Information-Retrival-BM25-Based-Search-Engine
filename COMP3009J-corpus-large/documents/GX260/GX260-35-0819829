22 4 Executive Summary The Pest Management Alliance (PMA) for the containerizednursery industry has 5 main goals: 1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
To To To To To encourage statewide adoption of reduced-risk, IF" practices by containerized nursery owners.
expand and strengthen dissemination oflPM information to nursery growers.
substantiate cost-effective reduced-risk practices throughthe use of demonstrations.
develop reduced risk strategies thatlegally certify nursery shipments free of red imported fire ants. encourage water management practices that reduce pesticides and fertilizers in run off.
To meet these goals, the PMA had 2 major objectives for the first year.
The first major objective was to find alternatives to the use of organophosphates and carbamate insecticides to control ants.
Our accomplishments for this objective include: 1.
The demonstration of improved methods of monitoring for red imported fire ants (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta Buren, in nurseries.
Improved monitoring meansthat pesticides are used only when the pest is found, thereby reducing the use ofpesticides.
We chose nurseries that had been positive for RIFA.
Our first monitoring method at the Tree of Life Nursery (Fig. 1) involved the placement of protein and sugar water bait stations every 20 ft in a grid pattern around the nursery.
We did this monthly for 12 months and recorded all speciesof ants that we found.
We never found RIFA subsequent to the original infestation, thereby preventing the application of pesticides every 3 months, as the state quarantine usually requires.
We thus avoided the use of pesticides on 36 acres at this nursery during the year ofmonitoring.
We have demonstrated that effective monitoring can substitute for quarterly broadcast pesticide applications.
At 4 other nurseries in Orange Co. we did intensive monitoring for RIFA around new infestations.
Our method of placing monitors in the pattern of a wheel around the find (Fig. 2) showed the extent ofthe infestation in each case, thereby justifying the use ofpesticide in a small area around the infestations.
These data have helped persuade state quarantine officials that monitoring for fire ants is reliable.
Therefore, the requirement for quarterly broadcast of pesticides in nurseries has been relaxed and only the immediate vicinity of the infestation needs to be treated.
2.
Evaluating possible alternatives to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides currently used for RIFA control.
All nurseries infested with RIFA are immediately treated.
Thus, to evaluate new products we ranseveral long-term studies at golf course communities in the Coachella Valley (Figs. 3 and 4).
We have demonstrated that a new pesticide, fipronil, is effective against fire ants in California.
This product has a much longer residual effectthan other pesticides, thus reducing the frequency of treatments (once a year instead of4 times a year, according to experts who have tested it in other states).
The fipronil does not require turning off irrigation, as do other fire ant products.
Fipronil will soon be on the market in California and will be available for fire ant control
.
In the laboratory we have also successfully shown the efficacy of4 liquid toxicants for use in fire ant baitstations that avoid any ground contamination with pesticides.
These toxicants will be field tested as sites in nurseries or golf courses are available.
We have also evaluated 4 drench alternatives for potted soil for ant control.
As find promising materials we will lobby the we USDA for changes in regulations regarding soil incorporation of pesticides.
5 The second objective was to help reducethe amount of insecticide runoff from nurseries.
The fire ant quarantine atplant nurseries requires that bifenthrin or chlorpyrifos be added to potting soil to prevent colonization of fire ants, These products have been detected in water runoff from nurseries operating under the California Department of Food and Agriculture compliance program.
Chlorpyrifos is an identified pollutant that has been found various water bodies in the state and is a listed in pollutant in the Newport Bay/San Diego Creek watershed TMDL, which is in the fire ant quarantine area.
The initial task was to set up a nursery site to demonstrate theprotection of surface and groundwater quality (El Modeno nursery).
Pesticide runoff hasbeen significantly reduced, with bifenthrin concentrations being reduced by 54%.
The second phase was then to have grower forums and workshops to demonstrate these practices.
Over 50 lectures, seminars, and workshops have included information fulfilling the objectives of the PMA grant (see Table 5).
We have added a third major objective that pertains equally to the first two:developing a website and newsletter for the PMA.
We have set up committee and workgroup to develop the web a site, and have entered into a contract for its development.
An agreement has also been reached with the California Association of Nurserymen (CAN) to host the website on their server.
Objective I. Alternatives to orpanophosphates and traditional pesticides.
Task 1.
Improving MonitoringTechniquesfor Red Imported Fire Ants A. Tree of Life nursery.
Two ant-monitoring techniques were employed at the Treeof Life Nursery in San Juan Valley to determine if native and invasive ant species were on the property.
Tree of Life Nursery is situated on 36 acres of which 20 are in actual production (Fig. 1).
RIFA, Solenopsis invictaBuren, were discovered on the property on November 1999, and the nursery has been monitored eversince.
This nursery is also special because it specializes in plants for restoration projects and tries tomaintain the property free of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile (Mayr).
Consequently, this nursery was an ideal site for demonstrating various ant-monitoring techniques.
Initially the property was inspected by CDFA.
Their monitoring technique is as follows: Approximately 3 g of Spam luncheon meat is placed in a small plastic cage.
The cages are staked into the ground approximately every 50 ft in a grid (20 bait stations per acre) in areas suspected of having S. invicta.
The monitor stations are placed out inthe early morning about 0900 hours and the species of ant feeding on the Spam are recorded after 4-5 hours.
The monitoring system is qualitative and no attempt is made to determine the number of ants present.
Properties that are positive for S. invicta are monitored every 3 months as part of the Quarantine Procedure.
Table 1 shows the species that CDFA identified at this location.
Pesticides were applied to theone location that had RIFA.
Instead of treating the entire nursery, as normally required by the quarantine protocol, we received permission to substitute intensive monitoring of the nursery for wide-scale pesticide application.
We placed 148 bait stations in a grid pattern alongthe rows of the nursery (see Fig. 1).
We used two monitoring techniques to determine the presence of RIFA and other ant species, to look for seasonal patterns in bait attractiveness to the ants, and to see whether one technique was more sensitive than the other.
Each station hadone protein and one sugar water bait, placed side by side.
The baits were covered with clay pots to protect them from water and animals.
For the protein bait we used 9 Lives Cat Food groundto 18 mesh particle size; we filled a 15 ml tube approximately half way with the food.
Next to it we placed vials of sugar water.
Using liquids to monitor ant activity is basedon a technique developed by Reierson et al. (1998) to monitor Argentine ant foraging activity.
Conical vials containing 13 ml of 25% sucrose water are placed on pedestals.
The vials are 6 covered with an inverted clay pot to protect them from irrigationand wild animals.
The vials containing sugar water were placed out next to the solid baits and retrieved after 24 hours.
The number of ants at each station and the species was recorded.
The Tree of Life nursery was monitored monthly for one year.
Results.
Table 1 shows the species originally found by CDFA with their Spam baits.
Table 2 shows the numbers of ants collected at either thesugar water (L) or the cat food (S), and Table 3 shows the number of monitors positive for each species.
The sugar water vials collected significantly more ants than did the solid baits for Dotymyrmex bicolor and D. pyramidis,Tapinoma sessile, Formicapilicornis,and Solenopsis xyloni.
Neither bait was effective in sampling Pogonomyrmex occidentale, Solenopsis molesta, or Curdiocondylu ectopia.
The sugar water baits were extremely effective in determining if D. bicolor, T. sessile, F. pilicornis, and S.xyloni were present throughout the year (Table 3).
Only on rare occasions were ants collected at the solid bait and not at the sugar bait. S. xyloni was frequently found on both baits, especially during summer months.
In the winter months, the sugar waterbaits were the most effective for the species responding to either bait.
Our intensive monitoring of this location avoided wide-scale applicationof pesticides.
It demonstrated that sugar water is a very effective monitor formany ant species any time of the year.
B. Wheel method for monitoring fire ants at nurseries.
One of the goals of monitoring for fire ants is delimiting the location of the ants in positive nurseries.
Pesticide treatments can then be put only in those areas that have the ants.
We designed a "wheel method" of monitoring fire ants where ant monitors are placed around a known infestation in the form of a wheel with 8 spokes (Fig. 2).
The center of the wheel corresponds to the known ant colony and sugar water and luncheon meat monitors are then placed every 10 ft along the spokes of the wheel.
We left the monitors for 24 hrs and then recorded where we found RIFA.
In this way wegot a precise picture of the infestation and the distance the ants were foraging.
We tried this method at 4 nurseries: Don's Wholesale Nursery, Sakaida Nursery, Color Spot Nursery, and Skypark Nursery, all in Orange Co.
Results.
We placed a total of 145 monitors in these 4 nurseries.
We found RIFA either at or within 1 ft of the monitors at 18% of the bait stations.
However, sugar water missed 27% of known RIFA locations, and the luncheon meatmissed 38% of known RIFA locations.
The meat and sugar water side by side only missed 12% of known RIFA locations.
Thus, the two monitors together were more successful than either one alone.
Finally, there were 160% more ants at the sugar water than the meat monitors.
Thus we have shown that a sugar water and protein bait together is more efficient thaneither one alone.
There are a couple of likely reasons for failure to detect RIFA at these monitors.
The most important is the presence of Argentine ants, whichcan chase RIFA from the monitors.
Another possible reason is that fire ants that have been treated with pesticides may bequeenless and not interested in feeding.
C. Monitoring at other nurseries.
The Pardee Tree Nursery in Bonsall, Orange Co., has adopted our technique of monitoring for fire ants using sugar water.
They havelaid out a grid of sugar water monitors at 50 ft intervals throughout their nursery as an early detection method forRIFA.
Because of this monitoring state officials have not had to do additional surveys at this location.
D. Pitfall traps We are demonstrating the use of pitfall traps for RIFA detection in nurseries and golf courses.We are constructing aboveground devices that can work in areas that may flood due toirrigation.
We plan to 7 leave these trapsin place for a couple of weeks to supplement quarterly fire ant detection monitoring.
We are searching for the best materials to use for these devices and also the best substrate for the ants to for walk on.
E. Corn chips vs. luncheon meat as ant monitors We have completed several laboratory and field trials comparing the efficacy of luncheon meat and corn chips in attracting fire ants to monitors.
These trials were done at Cot0 de Caza and in Rancho Mirage.
We do these trials in a large aluminum dish that has up to10 tubes containing pre-weighed amounts of the test materials.
The ants enter the dishes through plastic tubes and are free to take the materials back to their nests.
The tubes are then weighed again.
In all trials thus far the fire ants have shown preference for the luncheon meat.
However, the corn chips are cheap and easy to place on the ground in larger numbers.
We will continue to evaluate which materialis appropriate for which circumstances.
Task 2.
Replacement of Organophosphates and other Pesticides A. Demonstrating the useof new FUFA products.
We have run two demonstrations of the efficacy of fipronil at two country clubs in the Coachella Valley: Sunrise and Rancho Las Palmas, both in Rancho Mirage.
At each of these locations we comparedthe efficacy of fipronil with the standard treatments in use by the eradication agencies.
They typically apply baits containing an insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen) followed a week later by a bait with hydramethylnon.
These treatments are repeated every 3 months because they break down quickly and thereis no residual action beyond a couple of days.
On the other hand, granular fipronil binds tightly tothe upper layer of soil and hasan extended residual effect.
This characteristic is important in preventing new reinfestationsby fire ant queens that fly and drop into new areas, where they start new colonies.
Figs. 5 and 6 show typical results.
B. Trials with liquid toxicants.
Another plan to reduce pesticideusage is to use toxicants in sugar water bait stations, avoiding the use of any pesticides that touch the ground.
We have begun laboratory and field-testing of toxicants in sugar water.
We currently have 4 products with adequate water solubility for use in sugar water baits: boric acid, fipronil, thiomethoxam, and imidacloprid.
In the laboratory, for each of these products we set up 10 petri dishes at each concentration of toxicant with 10 RIFA workers in each to measure the time to kill half of the ants (LT50).
A second step was toset up mini-colonies consisting of 300 RIFA with a supply of the sugar water toxicant and we again measured time to kill half of the workers.
We are currently doing the field-testing of these products at RIFA sites to demonstrate that the liquid toxicants can eradicate fire ants.
C. Drench Substitutes.
The fire ant quarantine at plant nurseries requires that bifenthrin or chlorpyrifos be added to potting soil to prevent colonization with fire ants.
These insecticides are showing up with water runoff.
Our goal is to screen natural oils and non-pesticides to see whether we can find an alternative that would prevent ant colonization of potted plants.
Thus far we have looked at Orange Guard (limonene), Nouguard (capsaicin), Exxant (a turpentine solution), and other plant oils.
We put 300 ants into small pots with soil, added the liquid, and recorded either death the ants or whether they left the of pots.
Thus far we have found that the limonene and turpentine solutions immediately cause the ants to leave the soil.
The latest product we are examining is a neem oil derivative in a solid matrix that we are mixing with potting soil.
We are going to show whether the material successfully keeps ants out of soil.
Continued screening of these products should help to find reliable drench substitutes.
8 D. New fire ant bait Ongoing demonstration of a new fire antbait, "Chipco Firestar Fire Ant Bait", from Aventis.
This bait has an extremely low concentration of fipronil(O.00015 %) in a matrix consisting of a mixture of proteins, oils, and carbohydrates.
These baits may prove as effective as twostandard treatments consisting of pyriproxyfen followed by hydramethylnon.
We began 2 demonstrations on August, 2001 in South Orange Co. atCot0 de Caza and Ladera Ranch.
At that time we did pretreatment surveys of the ant populations.
The first bait application at Cot0de Caza was done one Sept.
A second application was 6.
done on November 5.
The Ladera Ranch treatment was done on October 4.
We did follow-up surveys of ant populations every 2 weeks.
We did an additional trial of the bait atthe Annenberg estate in Rancho Mirage, near Palms Springs, on Oct. 11.
Obiective 11.
Protection of surface water and eroundwater.
Task 1.
Demonstration of runoff mitigation.
A very successful pesticide runoff mitigation demonstration project has been implemented at a PMA member site (El Modeno Gardens, Irvine, CA).
In November 2001 we began testing the addition of polyacrylamide to assist in the mitigation of pesticide runoff from the nursery.
A multiple strategy plan was implemented utilizing several of the innovations listed in our PMA plan in addition to the use of polyacrylamides.
These innovations were: ` Improve irrigation management techniques to reduce pesticide and fertilizer run off. o El Modeno is upgrading their computerized irrigation software.
times and application uniformity.
o Irrigation system is being checked any maintenance problems and greater for attention will he paid to run 9 Optimize timing of applications and select best fertilizer formulations to reduce nitrate levels in runoff.
o o o Slow release fertilizers will be used whenever possible.
Use technology such as electrostatic sprayers to minimize off target movement of pesticides.
Scout more intensively so pests are taken care of early before heavy populations require more spray treatments.
` Use of vegetative border strips, grading, sand bags and holding ponds to reduce pesticide runoff o o Move runoff fromthe center of roadsto the side of the road in cement lined ditches. o Divert runoff into pipes whenever possible to prevent picking up sediment.
o Sand bags and holding ponds to reduce pesticide runoff, Use upstream sediment traps to reduce sediment load reaching vegetative filter.
Initially, one sitewas chosen to develop protocols and fieldexperience with the management of the system.
As part of their RIFA monitoring program, CDPR is monitoring pesticides in the runoff prior to entering the vegetative filter, which consists of a patented Canna Lily (Tropicana) and after exiting the vegetative filter.
Canna lilies are planted in a cement drainage channel.
Space for growing plants is in short supply, and the use of the drainage channel to grow a profitable patented plant variety has resulted in an economic incentive to implement the pesticide and nutrient mitigationand also has the added benefit of utilizing the nutrients, which wouldhave run off the property as a pollutant.
Flow and weekly nutrient monitoring is being funded by grants from CDFA-FREP (Fertilizer Research and Education Program) and the EPA 319(h) program.
9 The implementation of polyacrylamides to flocculate finesediments out of the runoff water, which we believe will dramatically reduce the offsite movement of bifenthrin, was initiated fullscale at the nursery in January, 2002.
A concentrated form of polyacrylamides is added to the turbulent stream of runoff prior to a sediment trap and pond at an approximate rate of 10 ppm. Flocculation occurs rapidly allowing the majority of the sediment to settle in the trapand pond.
The sediment trap allows for easy removal of sediment with a front-end loader as opposed to allowing sediment accumulate further into the system to (i.e. vegetative filter), where removal results in higher labor costs.
CDPR is continuing its monthly sampling of surface runoff entering and leaving the system and has conducted two samplings since the addition of polyacrylamides to the runoff.
The overall goal is to reduce bifenthrin in runoff leaving the nursery to non-toxic levels(
Dr. Kean Goh (California Department of Pesticide Regulation) noticed that even before theCanna plants were placed in the channel, our other mitigation efforts such as grading, building a sediment pond, and fine-tuning the nursery's irrigation system, resulted in a dramatic reduction in sediment and runoff.
In the RIFA Project in Orange County, June 2001 (STUDY 183) Dr. Goh states: "During June 2001, surface water samples were collected from five sites in Orange County, California.
Water samples collected from a mitigation filter strip planted with Canna showed a 54% reduction of bifenthrin concentrations (Table 4)."
Task 2.
Forums and workshops to disseminate information.
Over 50 lectures, seminars, and workshops have included information fulfilling the objectivesof the PMA grant (see Fig. 6, Table 5).
On September 14,2000 the Nursery PMA conducted a workshop/conference at the University of California, Riverside.
The workshop was attended by over 100 nursery and landscape professionals and dealt with the issues and challenges facing the nursery industry in California.
Top experts in their areas gave presentations on subjects such as the Glassy Winged Sharpshooter, Red Imported Fire Ants, Pesticide Runoff, etc.
A poster session was held at the end of the conference giving attendees and researchers a chance to interact.
Evaluations overwhelmingly gave the workshop an excellent rating.
The PMAheld a Glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) training meeting for nurseries and allied industries on January 24, 2002.
The meeting was held in Irvine,California at the University of California South Coast Research and Extension Center and attended byover 50 people.
The attendees received information about the regulations for shipping plants from Craig Hanes of CDFA.
County entomologists from Orange (Nick Nisson) and Napa (Joel King) Counties explained how county inspectors examine plants for adults for egg masses and adults in both the shipping and receiving counties.They also provided information regarding insecticide trials and trapping methods for monitoring.
Dr. David Morgan from CDFA finished up the meeting by reporting on his work on identifying, rearing, and releasing biocontrols for GWSS.
