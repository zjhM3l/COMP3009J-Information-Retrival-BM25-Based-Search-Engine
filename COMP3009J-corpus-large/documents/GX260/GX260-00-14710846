Bulletin A MONTHLY UPDATE ON RELEVANT TOPICS MINORITIES AND HIV/AIDS PREVENTION HIV/AIDS in the minority community is a severe and ongoing public health problem.
African Americans comprise over 40% of all new HIV/AIDS cases while Hispanics represent over 20%.
There is also critical concern about Asian Americans as well as Native Americans where many are high risk and hard to reach.
To help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in the minority community, HHS plans to establish crisis response teams that will taylor HIV/AIDS prevention strategies to the needs of racial and ethnic minority communities.
These teams of doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, and HIV prevention experts from SAMHSA, HRSA, and CDC will help assess existing prevention services for the minority community and develop innovative, effective strategies that best meet the needs of racial and ethnic minority groups.

AMBULATORY CARE Medical care is shifting from hospitals to outpatient settings.
The literature indicates that during 1996 an estimated 892 million visits were made to physician offices, hospital outpatient departments, and hospital emergency departments in the United States.
This was an overall rate of 3.4 visits per person.
The National Center for Health Statistics in its National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, found that persons 75 years and over had the highest rate of ambulatory care visits.
There were also an estimated 129.3 million injury-related ambulatory care visits during 1996.

CLINICAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES Clinical preventive services are preventive services that are offered or initiated in the personal health care setting and include such services as immunizations, disease screening, counseling to reduce health risks, and chemoprophylaxis after exposure to infectious disease.
The literature indicates that there is a great need for focused and well-funded research in this area to determine which preventive services are most needed, how effective they are, and how they should be delivered.
Research suggests that both the public and private sectors need to be actively involved in this pursuit.
AHCPR is currently funding studies that identify ways to increase the delivery and efficiency of recommended clinical preventive services.

NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS The National Health Service Corps is a program of the Health Resources Services Administration's Bureau of Primary Health Care.
It's mission is to assist medically underserved and vulnerable populations by placing physicians and other health care providers in these communities in exchange for scholarships or loan repayments for medical training.
The current literature discusses how this program and its services can lead to rewarding careers in the corps,
5 enrichment of relations with these populations to better serve their needs, and future plans for funding the program.

1997 NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) is an annual survey which provides estimates of illicit drug, alcohol and tobacco use in the United States.
This survey is based on a sample of the U.S. population.
The literature indicates that while drug use has remained level for 1997, youths between the ages of twelve and seventeen have increased their use of drugs--
6 particularly marijuana.
This survey suggests that work in combatting drug use should be focused on young people.
Research indicates that drug use among youths was higher for those who were currently using alcohol or tobacco.
SAMHSA has the preliminary results from the 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse on their website at: http://www.samhsa.gov/oas/nhsda/nhsda97/httoc.htm 41.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOPAMINE AND SCHIZOPHRENIA The most widely accepted pathophysiological explanation for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia is the "dopamine hypothesis."
This hypothesis suggests that the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are due primarily to hyperactivity in dopamine transmission.
The literature indicates that studies supporting this hypothesis deal with antipsychotic drugs that block postsynaptic dopamine receptors.
The drugs that produce the strongest blockade are also those that are most effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
Drugs that are dopamine antagonists also reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia.
Conversely, drugs that increase dopamine transmission tend to exacerbate the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
Research indicates that this hypothesis has received additional support through the study of post-mortem brains and by the use of neuroimaging studies.
NIMH is currently funding research
8 studying dopamine receptors in schizophrenic patients.
