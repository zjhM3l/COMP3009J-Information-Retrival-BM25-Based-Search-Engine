2 1 2 3 4 5 6 PROCEEDINGS MR. LIDSKY: We're going to get underway.
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's public meeting to discuss issues related to the administration of the imported fire ant program by plant protection and quarantine in light of
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
reduced funding for fiscal year 2000.
My name is Mike Lidsky.
I've been asked by the deputy administrator for plant protection and quarantine to be the moderator for today's meeting.
With me, on my immediate left, are Mr. Ron Milberg, and on my far left, Mr. Homer Collins.
Mr. Milberg is the operations officer for the
14 15 16 17 18 19
Invasive Species and Pest Management staff in Riverdale, Maryland.
This is a staff that provides headquarters support to the imported fire ant program.
Mr. Collins is the research leader at the Gulfport, Mississippi, Plant Methods Lab.
The lab is charged with developing regulatory treatments for the imported fire ant program.
20 21 22 23 24 25
The purpose of today's meeting in Austin is to give interested persons an opportunity to present their views or questions on the three options APHIS has presented for comment, as well as to present other possible options for administering the imported fire ant program, in light of reduced funding.
3 1 2 3 4 5 6 Notice of today's meeting was published in the Federal Register on March 2, on pages 11,281 through 11,283, and extra copies of the notice are available at the registration table.
Today's meeting in Austin is the third of four public meetings we're holding to solicit views from interested persons.
The first meeting was held in Raleigh,
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
North Carolina, on March 21, and the second was held in Orlando, Florida, on March 23.
The fourth meeting will be held in Santa Ana, California, March 30, at the County of Orange Hall of Administration Building, Board of Supervisors Anteroom, at 10 Civic Center Plaza.
The format for today's meeting will be as follows.
After I complete my remarks on the procedural
14 15 16 17 18 19
aspects of today's meeting, Mr. Milberg will make a short presentation on the history of the imported fire ant regulatory program, as well as the options that we've asked persons to comment on.
Should any questions arise about the regulatory treatments that are currently available or new regulatory or control strategies that the agency is
20 21 22 23 24 25
pursuing, Mr. Collins would be the best person to answer such questions.
Persons who have registered to speak will be given an opportunity to speak before unregistered persons.
Today's meeting is scheduled to conclude at 5:00 p.m.
However, we will conclude the meeting before 5:00 if all
4 1 2 3 4 5 6 persons who have registered to participate have been heard and there are no other persons that wish to speak.
I know that we will be keeping the meeting open until at least 10:30 this morning to accommodate a speaker that wishes to speak at that time.
I'll announce any other procedural rules that may be necessary for the conduct of
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
today's meeting.

7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Today I'll provide some background on the IFA program and then talk about how it's evolved over the years and then finally discuss today's situation.
To begin with, the imported fire ant, or IFA, were introduced into the southern United States 60 to 80 years ago.
After the ants were first observed around 1920, landowners in infested areas began applying available
14 15 16 17 18 19
insecticides, such as calcium cyanide dust.
With the advent of chlorinated hydrocarbons to cost-effectively control the ants, a federal quarantine was established in 1958.
The quarantine currently regulates all or portions of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina,
20 21 22 23 24 25
Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
The federal quarantine regulates the movement of articles known to spread IFA, including nursery stock and soil.
The original program was a cooperative effort between APHIS and the states in three areas, including detection, to find and eradicate isolated infestations;
7 1 2 3 4 5 6 regulatory activity, to slow IFA's spread by controlling the movement of regulated articles; and finally, control, to reduce to reduce populations, using wide-area pesticide applications.
As registrations and food tolerances for chlorinated hydrocarbons were canceled during the 1960s and
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
1970s, wide-area pesticide applications were no longer practical due to the poor efficacy of available pesticides.
The IFA program then shifted to baits and organophosphates.
Unfortunately, some of these compounds, such as chlorpyrifos, were less effective than previously used materials.
During the 1980s, with the continued loss of
14 15 16 17 18 19
chemicals, the federal program focused on methods development, primarily testing of new materials to certify regulated articles for interstate movement.
During the 1990s, appropriations for many federal domestic programs declined or were capped, and states assumed more IFA survey and regulatory responsibility.
Such
20 21 22 23 24 25
state activities were conducted, in part, using cooperative funding agreements with APHIS.
Most federal dollars were passed through to the states to ensure compliance with the federal quarantine.
I'll put up a graph here that shows funding over the last 10 years or so, and as shown on this graph, the
8 1 2 3 4 5 6 continued pressure on domestic budgets caused funding for the IFA program to decline from about $5 million in 1990 to $100,000 in 2000.
Of this year's $100,000 appropriation, Congress earmarked 58,000 for IFA work in New Mexico.
And given the current funding level, essentially no dollars are available for pass-through to the other states.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Despite the low funding level, APHIS continues to maintain the federal quarantine by annually updating the list of infested areas contained in the Federal Register.
In addition, our Investigative and Enforcement Services staff looks into about 10 to 20 quarantine violations annually.
About a third of these cases are closed with
14 15 16 17 18 19
warnings issued by the local plant protection and quarantine officer for a first-time violation.
Another third are closed with no action if the shipping facility was under a compliance agreement and treatments were applied in accordance with that agreement.
The last third are assessed civil penalties in accordance with the law.
These normally
20 21 22 23 24 25
range up to $1,000 per violation, which is the maximum allowed by statute.
The typical fine ranges from $500 to $2,000, depending on the severity of the violation and the number of -- number we can charge.
In addition to our IES activity, APHIS continues to focus on development of new regulatory treatments and
9 1 2 3 4 5 6 nursery compliance protocols.
About $350,000 is allocated annually to Gulfport, Mississippi, for methods development work.
To our knowledge, Gulfport is the only facility in the country that is developing IFA regulatory treatments.
So, given the above developments, we decided to hold public meetings and to get input on what direction the
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
IFA program should take.
To help stimulate discussion on this issue, we proposed the three options shown.
Under option one, we would maintain our imported fire ant program with minimal regulatory activity, in line with current funding.
This option would provide uniform standards and consistent interstate shipping requirements for the regulated industry.
Under this option, with the current
14 15 16 17 18 19
funding level, most states would enforce the federal quarantine without federal dollars.
Under option two, we would eliminate the federal quarantine and develop model guidelines for states to use in harmonizing their quarantines.
This option would reduce federal costs and may provide uniformity without federal
20 21 22 23 24 25
regulation.
However, under this option, states may impose more or less stringent requirements, and these requirements could differ from state to state.
Under option three, we would eliminate the IFA regulations and would participate in establishing a voluntary nursery compliance program.
This option would
10 1 2 3 4 5 6 also reduce federal costs and may provide uniformity without federal regulation.
However, such a certification program is not mandatory and could result in less than 100 percent participation.
At this time, the agency has made no decision on how to proceed.
All options, including any submitted in
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
writing or presented at this meeting, will be considered before a final decision is proposed.
Thank you again for your interest, and that concludes my briefing.
MR. LIDSKY: Okay.
I'm going to call our first registered speaker, and that is Mr. Benny Graves, please.
MR. GRAVES: It's good to be with you today.
I'm
14 15 16 17 18 19
Benny Graves.
I represent the Mississippi Department of Agriculture Bureau of Plant Industry and I'd like to read a few comments from the Mississippi Department of Agriculture concerning this issue.
"We are glad to have this opportunity to comment on the course of action USDA-APHIS should take in dealing
20 21 22 23 24 25
with the federal fire ant quarantine.
The Mississippi Department of Agriculture Bureau of Plant Industry believes that USDA-APHIS should maintain the imported fire ant quarantine.
Keeping the federal fire ant quarantine in place is of vital importance to our nursery and beekeeping industries.
Both of these agricultural industries ship into
11 1 2 3 4 5 6 uninfested states.
Because of the USDA-APHIS involvement in the fire ant quarantine, there is a uniform, consistent set of rules for our nurseries and beekeepers to follow when shipping into uninfested states.
We do not want to see the federal fire ant quarantine replaced with state-by-state fire ant rules governing how a crop must be grown, shipped,
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
or treated.
Such regulatory action at the state level would create a regulatory nightmare for the affected industries in our state.
"Mississippi currently has 117 nurseries and nursery dealers and 20 beekeepers who would be immediately impacted by any change in the federal fire ant quarantine.
"Beyond these two industries, the Mississippi
14 15 16 17 18 19
Department of Agriculture believes the USDA-APHIS should be involved because of the national threat fire ants pose as an invasive species.
Fire ants have a negative impact on both public health and environment whenever they become established.
This threat should be taken seriously at the federal level.
The minimum action level should be the
20 21 22 23 24 25
continuation of the federal fire ant quarantine."
In addition to that, of course, Mississippi would support any funding mechanism to increase funding on the federal fire ant program.
"In conclusion, the Mississippi Bureau of Plant Industry thanks the USDA-APHIS for the opportunity to make
12 1 2 3 4 5 6 this public comment."
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much.
Mr. Eddy Edmondson, please.
MR. EDMONDSON: Good morning.
I'm Eddy Edmondson.
I'm the president and CEO of the Texas Nursery and Landscape Association.
The Texas Nursery and Landscape
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Association, hereafter referred to as TNLA, is a trade organization that represents all segments of the nursery and the landscape industry in Texas, being the wholesale production, retail, landscape, and allied businesses.
The sales volume of the nursery and landscape products and services in Texas is in excess of $14 billion annually.
My comments are made on behalf of our members.
14 15 16 17 18 19
In addition to those members who are present here today, there are over 1,000 growers in Texas alone who are affected by this quarantine.
Unfortunately, this hearing is taking place during the busiest time of the year for growers, which is the spring shipping season, and only a few can be present today to testify.
We have received copies of letters from a
20 21 22 23 24 25
large number of growers who will be submitting written comments.
Both our industry and our state have felt the sting of the imported fire ant issue personally and in our pocketbooks for over 20 years.
The nursery and landscape industry has willingly assumed a portion of the financial
13 1 2 3 4 5 6 burden for slowing the spread of this agricultural and health menace across the United States.
Since the imported fire ant problem has been around for many years, it is possible that during the USDAAPHIS budget development process, it suffered from being a longstanding issue, losing the impetus of being a "hot
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
issue."
We welcome this opportunity to inform decisionmakers about the impact of losing funding for the imported fire ant quarantine.
One reason that past efforts to control the spread of the imported fire ant have experienced some success has been the implementation of a single quarantine standard across the country.
The quarantine has not been
14 15 16 17 18 19
abused as a means of regionalism or as a protectionist ploy, because all states were playing under the same rules enforced by the federal quarantine.
The value of a united effort is further illustrated by the Texas Imported Fire Ant Research and Management Plan adopted by the 74th Texas Legislature.
This
20 21 22 23 24 25
plan includes research, education, quarantine and survey projects, and community-wide management efforts.
The lead agency is the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, with cooperation among the Texas A
14 1 2 3 4 5 6 In 1998, this project produced a regional publication for Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, prepared by Drs. Bastiaan Drees and Charles Barr of the Texas A
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Georgia.
We have seen positive results from the Fire Ant Management Plan after only a few years.
The national effort would do well to use the philosophy of this program as a model and focus on a unified research and implementation approach rather than creating an environment in which each state may go its own way.
The imported fire ant issue is not just a nursery and landscape
14 15 16 17 18 19
issue, not just an agricultural issue.
It is a health and human safety issue, and as such, it is worthy of the attention of the federal government.
However, the very nature of the problem presents a threat to our industry.
Imagine for a moment that the states not yet infested decided it was in the interest of
20 21 22 23 24 25
their citizens to cut off all imports of plant material in soil from the quarantined states.
Availability of plant material to the nursery and landscape markets in the uninfested areas would be affected, because most of the major growing areas of the United States are in the quarantined states.
The economy of the quarantined states
15 1 2 3 4 5 6 would be affected, because the nursery and landscape industry is a significant economic factor in these states.
Scientists tell us that it is not possible to completely contain the spread of the imported fire ant.
Therefore, we contend that the best strategy is to slow the spread of this pest down with proven techniques that do not
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
disrupt the economies of the areas involved.
Another issue affected by the quarantine is fair competition in the marketplace.
A uniform quarantine with adequate funding to state departments of agriculture for surveys and enforcement helps ensure that law-abiding businesses are not at an unfair competitive disadvantage.
In the interest of economic health, human health
14 15 16 17 18 19
and safety, and marketplace equity, the Texas Nursery and Landscape Association strongly urges restoration of $7.5 million in funding for the USDA-APHIS imported fire ant line item.
Our organization is available to provide information and background on this issue at any time, and if
20 21 22 23 24 25
any of you have any questions today, I'll be glad to address them.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much.
Mr. Craig Albiston, please.
MR. ALBISTON: Turkey Creek Farms appreciates the opportunity to comment at this public hearing.
We strongly
16 1 2 3 4 5 6 urge that the federal fire ant quarantine be maintained and that funding be restored to combat this destructive and invasive pest.
Red imported fire ants were accidentally introduced into the United States near Mobile, Alabama, in the early 1900s.
This invasive pest has spread throughout
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
the Southeast, from eastern North Carolina, south to Florida, and west through much of Texas.
The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, otherwise known as APHIS, maintains a quarantine to slow the spread into uninfested areas.
The quarantine includes rules for shipping fire-ant-free nursery and greenhouse plants.
Quarantine activities, such as infestation surveys,
14 15 16 17 18 19
compliance monitoring and enforcement are shared by APHIS and the states.
The partnership between the federal government and state governments has worked well on this issue.
Federal funding has been virtually eliminated for fiscal year 2000.
With no funding, the states and affected
20 21 22 23 24 25
industries will be burdened to finance this quarantine.
Some have even spoken about rescinding the federal quarantine altogether.
This would not be good.
Imported fire ants pose a danger to human health, to our agriculture, and to our property.
According to a Texas A
17 1 2 3 4 5 6 September 19, 1999, "The red imported fire ant is digging deep into the wallets of Texans.
Damage and management of the imported pest in the five major urban areas of Texas cost more than $580 million in 1998."
There are huge areas of the United States which are still uninfested.
They want to stay free from this pest as long as possible.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
The American nursery industry is the most promising growth segment in American agriculture.
The majority of us are small businesses and family farms, and since both field-grown and containerized nursery stock are regulated under the federal quarantine, we bear considerable costs to comply with the quarantine requirements.
We have been and are willing to share the burden of controlling the
14 15 16 17 18 19
pest.
Turkey Creek Farms is the largest containergrowing operation in Harris County, Texas.
Our 160-acre nursery is located in northern Harris County, near Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport.
We grow a diverse assortment of trees, shrubs, and color plants in containers ranging
20 21 22 23 24 25
from 4 inch to 15 gallons.
And while greenhouse and bedding plants account for about 60 percent of our annual sales, about 90 percent of our acreage in production is devoted to trees and shrubs.
Our pest management practices include baiting, scouting for pests, and periodic spot treatments, all done
18 1 2 3 4 5 6 with the aim of diligently working to grow superior quality, pest-free products that our customers demand.
On September 23, 1994, Fireban, a synthetic pyrethroid, was approved by APHIS for the imported fire ant quarantine program and imported fire-ant-free nursery program.
We use Fireban in our soil mix.
Twice a year, we
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
bait with Logic, and we spot-treat with Orthene, Diazinon, and Dursban.
Inspectors from the Texas Department of Agriculture routinely visit us to ensure our compliance to the federal fire ant quarantine in addition to monitoring our pest eradication efforts.
Depending on their size, individual nurseries are
14 15 16 17 18 19
likely spending anywhere from a few thousand to several hundred thousand dollars a year on fire ants.
Our annual expenses at Turkey Creek Farms are about $58,200.
They are broken down as follows: labor cost for baiting and pesticide applications, $6,200; administrative costs, management expenses, $3,000; soil amendment, $46,400;
20 21 22 23 24 25
baiting with Logic, $600; and the pesticide spot treatments, $2,000.
Turkey Creek Farms ships to customers in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.
If the states are left alone to fund and erect their own quarantine regulations, nursery
19 1 2 3 4 5 6 producers like ourselves will be faced with multiple standards for the products we grow and ship.
Furthermore, adequate enforcement is needed to ensure that law-abiding businesses are not put at an unfair competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.
This can only happen through an adequately funded federal quarantine.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
While we may never be able to eradicate fire ants, the federal quarantine that is being administered by the states' departments of agriculture are working to slow the advance into uninfested areas, while pesticides and better management techniques work to reduce the widespread damage of these pests.
Universities, like Texas A
14 15 16 17 18 19
and better controls, and chemical manufacturers are bringing new pest management tools on line.
Because fire ants are both an invasive species and a human health threat, preventing their spread is a legitimate public goal and a reasonable expenditure of public funds.
While there is a need for partnership between
20 21 22 23 24 25
the federal government and state governments, the federal government, through APHIS, is best equipped to deal with the fire ant issue.
We urge those of you here today to support the restoration of the $7.5 million in funding for the USDAAPHIS fire ant line item in order to ensure a viable and effective quarantine.
20 1 2 3 4 5 6 Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Glenn Schroeter, please.
MR. SCHROETER: My name is Glenn Schroeter.
I'm from the Antique Rose Emporium in Brenham, Texas.
We have a wholesale, retail, and mail order business.
We have about
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
30 people in our production facility and about another 30 people at our retail centers, and we do a couple million dollars a year worth of sales.
We are in a fire ant county, and we do not wish to spread fire ants elsewhere.
It is our purpose to grow plants, not to spread the fire ants.
We ship to all 50 states via UPS.
We have inspectors that come to our
14 15 16 17 18 19
facilities twice a week to make sure that we comply.
APHIS gives us a uniform set of standards to meet.
We know where we are when we deal with this set of rules.
The imported fire ant knows no borders.
It is a national issue.
They are going to cross the borders into other states, so it is a national issue.
20 21 22 23 24 25
APHIS says that we have done our part, that we are willing to do what is necessary at a national level instead of compete against each other.
Another thing that it allows us small people to do is it allows us to enter markets competitively and not to be excluded unfairly by a noninfested area.
21 1 2 3 4 5 6 MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
James Harden, please.
MR. HARDEN: I'm James Harden from Mortellaro's Nursery in San Antonio.
The name is H-A-R-D-E-N.
Mortellaro's Nursery is a family-owned business.
We've got three generations currently active in the business.
We're a
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
wholesale grower of nursery stock.
We operate nurseries in three counties in Texas.
They're all in the fire ant quarantine area.
We employ 75 people, approximately, and we sell our product only in the state of Texas, but some of the state is not in fire ant areas, and we have to treat before we can ship into those areas.
We drench, and then an
14 15 16 17 18 19
inspector comes and checks it to make sure.
A lot of the plant material we purchase in smaller size are liners coming from different states, and they could come in, without rules, now because the federal quarantine covers all of those.
And we've been fighting the fire ant on our
20 21 22 23 24 25
property for years to keep it from spreading.
We treat; we are inspected.
Once a year we do a total broadcast of the whole nursery, and then we spot-treat occasionally when we find the pest, the ants.
And we spend probably $2,000 to $3,000 to treat the whole nursery, and then I don't know how much we spend in labor in the spot treating, because it's
22 1 2 3 4 5 6 just whenever we need them.
And we're inspected by the Texas Department of Agriculture, and our product is shipped with certification that it is fire ant free.
I'm asking you to support the nursery industry in the fight against the imported fire ant that is spreading
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
throughout the United States.
Please support the restoration of federal funding for the fire ant quarantine.
Presently, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service maintains a quarantine to slow the spread of the imported fire ant to uninfected areas.
The quarantine includes rules for shipping fire-ant-free nursery and greenhouse plants.
These quarantine activities are
14 15 16 17 18 19
shared by APHIS and the state.
However, the program has been declining for years, and this year funding has been virtually eliminated.
This not only shifts an undue burden onto the states -- and is leading to pressure to revoke the federal quarantine altogether.
The quarantine allows for a
20 21 22 23 24 25
coordinated, consistent approach to slowing the fire ant's spread.
This means one set of rules for shipping products interstate.
Revocation of the quarantine would open up the opportunity for uninfected states to pass their own rules, leaving our industry struggling to comply with confusing and perhaps even conflicting demands for treating and
23 1 2 3 4 5 6 certifying.
Federal funding assistance should be restored and the quarantine kept in place.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Robert Cartwright, please.
MR. CARTWRIGHT: I am Robert Cartwright.
I'm
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
with Ran-Pro Farms in Tyler, Texas.
The imported fire ant is an invasive insect pest that has been in the United States since the early 1900s and has spread throughout the Southeast and west throughout Texas, and now is in Southern California.
Efforts to eradicate the fire ant have gone on for years but have ultimately failed.
14 15 16 17 18 19
USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service research and quarantines have helped in slowing the spread of the fire ant.
The federal quarantines and rules allow for wholesale nursery growers like Ran-Pro Farms, Inc., to follow one set of uniform rules for shipping fire-ant-free nursery plants interstate.
20 21 22 23 24 25
States in the quarantine areas of the Southeast, Texas, and California are major production areas for nursery and greenhouse plants.
These regions are growing literally billions of dollars' worth of plants which are shipped to all areas of the country.
Revocation of the uniform federal quarantines would allows states not infested the opportunity
24 1 2 3 4 5 6 to have their own rules, which would leave our industry struggling to comply with confusing and even conflicting demands for treatment to certify plants entering their states.
In fact, it could allow for restriction of trade, depending on how each state established their rules.
As a grower who currently ships plants into 28
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
states, revocation of the federal quarantine would create a major problem for us, to know each state's individual requirements for shipping into them.
It will also likely create a problem for the Texas Department of Agriculture, its inspectors, as well as the other state agricultural agencies, by causing them to have to complete different certificates for each state.
14 15 16 17 18 19
The national concern over invasive species is at an all-time high, and the imported fire ant is just one of these species.
It is a troublesome public health and agricultural pest.
It should be a shared goal of the federal government and the horticultural industry to prevent and slow the movement of this pest into uninfested areas of
20 21 22 23 24 25
the country.
As a company in a quarantined state, we have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past 15 years to produce and ship fire-ant-free plants into our markets.
This may not seem like a lot of money, but for a small company like Ran-Pro Farms, it's substantial.
25 1 2 3 4 5 6 It is very disturbing for me to learn that the federal government and USDA-APHIS has cut funding for fire ant research, quarantine research, and implementation of programs from the federal budget.
I'm hereby requesting that this budget cut be reconsidered and monies reinstated for these programs.
This
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
funding will ensure uniform quarantine and compliance for shipping fire-ant-free nursery plants to all states in the country and also slow the movement of this invasive pest.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Sid Miller, please.
MR. MILLER: Good morning.
Is it okay if I just stand there? I'm not much of a speaker.
I'm really just a
14 15 16 17 18 19
country hayseed.
I'm Sid Miller.
I have a little nursery and tree company, and I'm from Stephenville, Texas.
I have a family operation there, a nursery business.
We farm 120 acres of nursery stock, and our nursery's been there since 1950.
My wife and myself and my two sons and my brother
20 21 22 23 24 25
and my sister are all involved.
In addition to the nursery business, we farm several row crops and raise cattle.
Now, we ship our nursery stock all the way from Washington, D.C., to California, so it's important, this quarantine program.
It affects my business immensely, being able to ship in and out of those states.
26 1 2 3 4 5 6 You know, the Texas agriculture economy right now is probably not very good.
We're going through a three-year drought.
We've got the lowest commodity prices we've had in years.
Grain prices are at an all-time low.
The cotton price is at a low.
But one bright spot in the agriculture economy here in Texas is our nursery industry.
It is a
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
robust, growing economy.
Now, to lift this quarantine and put it on the states will be the demise of that.
And I'll explain to you why.
If this fire ant quarantine is not handled properly, it'll put an end to the robust nursery trade here in Texas.
You know, the fire ant -- the Latin name for the fire ant is Solenopsis invicta.
I think that's very
14 15 16 17 18 19
fitting, because when it's translated, that translates to the "unconquered invader."
I think that's a very fitting name for them.
You know, this pest does untold damage at my nursery.
We spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars each year, repairing irrigation pumps, solenoid valves,
20 21 22 23 24 25
electrical boxes.
They get into our farm machinery.
We put out fire ant bait.
We treat.
We drench all our plants before we go out, so it does affect me economically quite a bit.
We spend quite a few dollars trying to handle this pest.
I'd like to tell you a little bit about my
27 1 2 3 4 5 6 hobbies, because this pest affects them, too.
The two things I like to do when I'm not working is bird-hunt and trout-fish.
And I want to tell you, I've got some bird dogs that are probably going to die of old age before they see a native covey of quail in my county.
These fire ants, when the baby quail hatch out, they devour them.
The ones that
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
live, the fire ants eat up the small insects that they need for food to survive.
So they have really decimated the quail population in my county and several surrounding counties.
I live up in north central Texas.
My other hobby I mentioned was trout fishing.
There's not that many trout fisheries in the state of Texas, but the best one we have is not far from here, down on the
14 15 16 17 18 19
Guadalupe River.
Trout love ants.
They get fat on ants.
They're almost pure protein.
And the last spring, the fire ants in that Guadalupe watershed begin to mate, and they fly up and, most of you know, they come back down.
Well, numerous ants landed in the river, and the fish ingested those ants.
Well, the venom in the fire ant is toxic.
And
20 21 22 23 24 25
those fire ants killed 23,000 rainbow trout and ruined my fishing! They got my quail, and now they've got my fish! So, you know, I'm ticked off.
I don't think we've had a pest of this magnitude in this state since the screwworm.
I mean, it affects all aspects of agriculture.
And it also is affecting our
28 1 2 3 4 5 6 recreation, and the screwworm didn't even do that.
So, you know, what I'm here to plead with you today is, do not bail out on us.
We need more help, if anything, on this fire ant program.
Normally, I think that less federal regulation is a good thing, but in this case, I'm going to have to back up
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
on that, because we need some uniform regulation.
And I'll give you a couple examples that I've had myself of what happens to me, to a nurseryman, when the states regulate the quarantine theirselves.
A few years back, I had a customer -- as I said, I'm a tree grower.
One of the tree crops we grow is pecan trees.
I had a customer that wanted a big order, nice
14 15 16 17 18 19
order, of pecan trees shipped into New Mexico.
I called the TDA, got my fire ant approval and all things that we needed to -- from the TDA, the federal level.
Well, I called -- I thought, I better call New Mexico, because I haven't sent any out there before, just to see what I need to do.
So I called their agriculture department in New
20 21 22 23 24 25
Mexico.
They said, "Well, Mr. Miller, we really don't allow any pecan trees into our state."
I said, "Well, what do you mean?" He said, "Well, yeah, you can ship them in.
There's a couple things you can do."
He said, "The first thing you can do, if you want to ship your pecan trees in, is you have to knock all the dirt off the roots and then dip them in
29 1 2 3 4 5 6 some hot, scalding water."
I said, "Oh, really?" Well, y'all may not be nurserymen, but you can probably figure out what that does to the livability of the pecan tree.
I said, "Well, I don't think that'll work in my case."
"Well, there's one other thing you can do, Mr. Miller, if you want to send them out here.
You can build a
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
vault big enough to hold these pecans you want to ship out here, and you can gas them with methyl bromide."
I don't know if you know anything about methyl bromide, but it's probably one of the deadliest gasses known to man.
It'll kill anything big enough to die.
Well, that's not something that I want on my place, so I have never been able to sell any pecan trees to New Mexico.
14 15 16 17 18 19
A second instance on this state quarantine, I had a company from California come in, and everybody wants to be like Texas.
And I was flattered.
They wanted to put in a Texas exhibit.
I said, "You bet.
Come on down, we'll fix you up."
So they wanted some native Texas plant material.
Well, on the first shipment that was going out there, half
20 21 22 23 24 25
of the truckload was a native plant that grows right out here on these limestone hills.
It's called Mexican persimmon or native black persimmon.
Well, I did all my checking again.
I was real careful this time, because I'd already been bitten once on those pecan trees.
So we did the fire ant quarantine and checked on the nematode thing
30 1 2 3 4 5 6 and checked with the California Department of Agriculture: "Everything's okay.
Send them on."
Well, we get out there, and I got the, Oh-by-theway rule when we got out there.
I don't know if you've heard of that one, but when they got there, it was, "Oh, by the way, Mr. Miller, these native trees you sent are fruit
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
trees."
I said, "They're what?" "Yes, they're a native persimmon, and we don't allow fruit trees shipped into our state.
We've got them offloaded out here in a pile, and we need to burn them."
I said, "Oh, really.
Well, that's great."
He said, "Well, you can send a truck back out here and pick them up."
Well, that's 3,400 miles to send a truck back out there and pick those up and bring them back, so
14 15 16 17 18 19
that wasn't an option.
So they pile my trees up out there and burn them.
I did have a little consolation, though, because the other half of that truck were Texas mesquite trees, and I think every one of them lived, and I hope they infected the whole county out there.
20 21 22 23 24 25
(General laughter.)
MR. MILLER: So those are some examples of what happens when the state regulates a quarantine.
They're going to regulate us out.
Texas has real open borders.
We bring in a lot of nursery stock.
We are real compliant.
But there are some states out there that would like to keep
31 1 2 3 4 5 6 us out.
And I'm afraid that's what's going to happen in this case.
You know, I've looked at this thing.
I don't know all there is to know about it, but it looks like to me that the states are bearing most of the cost of this program.
And I think what we're asking for is to keep $7.5
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
million in the line item to keep this program going.
If we can do that, I would sure appreciate it.
If we can do it with less money, that would be even better.
I'm not for spending a lot of money, but I do believe it's imperative to the nursery industry, to the sod industry.
You know, these commodities, they could -- you know, they could regulate our hay products out, our grain
14 15 16 17 18 19
products out.
No end to what some of these states could do to limit our exporting from state to state.
So I urge you, as a farmer and as a nurseryman, to please consider overseeing this program.
And actually we need more effort instead of less effort, on my part.
So I encourage you to restore the fire ant line
20 21 22 23 24 25
item to the APHIS budget.
If you have any questions, I'll be around today.
I'll be glad to visit with you.
And other than that, I sure thank you for your time and your consideration.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much.
Dan Batson, please.
32 1 2 3 4 5 6 MR. BATSON: I'm Dan Batson with Green Forest Nursery in Perkinston, Mississippi.
I appreciate your time and letting us come and speak.
I'm not going to read my prepared statement.
It's going to reiterate a lot of the things that you've already heard today.
I would like to bring up just three points that I
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
think are most pertinent to what I'm here about.
As I say, I do represent my company.
I also represent American Nursery and Landscape Association, as a director of the grower division.
The three points I would like to bring up is, if all the states bring forth their regulations, our nursery and every nursery in the quarantine area, if they want to
14 15 16 17 18 19
ship outside the quarantine area, are basically going to have to comply with the most stringent laws of whatever state that may be in, if they want to ship into that state.
Our costs right now are fairly significant to come into compliance, but the costs could soar to astronomical amounts if there was one state that was
20 21 22 23 24 25
significant enough to our production and we had to comply with that state if we wanted to ship in there.
So the entire nursery would have to comply with that state, whether we shipped 25, 10 percent, whatever percentage of our production was there.
We happen to produce large container material,
33 1 2 3 4 5 6 15-, 25-, 45-, and we're getting into 65-gallon containers.
Our production time is a minimum of four years, but an average of five to six years.
I'm really concerned about the changing laws.
And if laws were to change within our production time, we may be rendered noncompliant, and there would be absolutely no way that we -- or almost impossible,
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
anyway, to come into compliance.
With the chemical, the Talstar that we mix into our mix, and the size containers that we have, if someone changes the laws and they want more of the Talstar in that mix, there's absolutely no way we can do that.
You cannot topically apply the Talstar, because it will not filter down into the depth of the containers we have.
So if the laws
14 15 16 17 18 19
change, we may be without an opportunity to ship.
Another concern I have is, in our shipment of plant material, we ship to different orders.
Therefore that truck may be going into different states.
With the regulations of the different states and dropping off into different states, the paperwork that we would have to do as
20 21 22 23 24 25
to -- as that truck goes through those states in compliance with those different states.
Again, I thank you for your time, and I would be glad to answer any questions from my particular business.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
34 1 2 3 4 5 6 Lee Howell, please.
MR. HOWELL: I'm going to be like Mr. Batson: In the interest of time, I won't read this whole prepared statement.
But I'm Lee Howell with Rocky Creek Nursery.
We have a growing operation in Lucedale, Mississippi.
I also serve as a director of Chapter 4 for the Southern Nursery
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Association that is comprised of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
But I would like to express my appreciation for having the opportunity to be here this morning.
My business is a family business.
I'm a third generation in this business, and my brother and myself continue to operate that.
We have a 70-acre container
14 15 16 17 18 19
nursery, and we ship probably 60 percent of our material out of the state.
A good example of how stringent another state can be, Tennessee is our neighbor to the north.
Several years ago, there was a situation where there was a lot of concern at the movement of the imported fire ant into that area, and
20 21 22 23 24 25
they were really watching for any shipments coming in.
And pretty much every shipment we sent into that state, before that shipment entered the state, they had to have an inspector there to inspect the material as it came off the trucks.
So I've always said that my biggest concern for
35 1 2 3 4 5 6 the fire ant is not being so much compliant with the agreement, but if I get one customer that gets a container with fire ants in it, that's economic to me, so that's not going -- I don't need that customer to have that kind of problem.
So we treat every container.
Our medium is amended with the Talstar so we can ship anywhere in the
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
United States.
I have customers out in Seattle, as far away as Seattle, Washington, and so we need to be compliant anywhere in the United States.
I'll reiterate that the main thing we need is that uniform set of compliance codes.
That's going to be the key for the nursery industry.
And I think, like Mr. Miller said, right now agriculture is having a struggle, to
14 15 16 17 18 19
say the least, in the economic department.
And right now, the horticulture industry is really the only profitable segment of any agricultural entities.
And we would like for that success to continue.
I think that you're going to continually hear the thing today stressed is just that we need that uniform set
20 21 22 23 24 25
of compliance codes, and I think that's probably the most important issue here today is that we try to revive that and hopefully restore that funding.
I know that the only research facility in the United States that I know of is located right there at Gulfport, Mississippi.
And we would certainly hate to see
36 1 2 3 4 5 6 that facility be reduced to where it's not operating anymore.
It's been a very important part of our state and, more importantly, of the whole Southeast.
I certainly appreciate your time.
If I can answer any questions a little later, I'll be happy to do so.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Donald Taton, please.
And I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.
MR. TATUM: My name is Tatum? VOICE: We always told you you wrote chicken scratch.
MR. TATUM: Hey, I printed that.
(General laughter.)
14 15 16 17 18 19 worse.
MR. TATUM: That's all right.
I've been called
I brought with me the Federal Register, and I was going to read it if things got slow.
So -- but I won't if that was the way my name was going to come out.
I, too, am from Mississippi.
I serve as the
20 21 22 23 24 25
executive secretary and treasurer of the Mississippi Nursery and Landscape Association.
In case you haven't noticed, I am a state nursery specialist with the Department of Plant and Soil Science with Mississippi State University, of which we wear our official uniforms when possible.
So today I am representing the green industry from Mississippi, as the
37 1 2 3 4 5 6 state executive, and we have, in membership of nurseries and the landscape industry, directly represented over 530 nursery and greenhouse growers, independent retail and garden centers, and landscape professionals.
According to USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service, the nursery and greenhouse industry
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
remains the fastest growing segment of agriculture.
The census of Agriculture shows that nursery, greenhouse, and floracultural crop sales totaled $10.9 billion in '97, up from 7.6 billion in '92.
Also, on a retail level, they're talking about the green industry being over $60 billion.
Nursery and greenhouse crops rank third nationally, behind only corn and
14 15 16 17 18 19
soybeans.
And I wish I could tell some of the agronomic crops there is in Mississippi, make them believe it.
The agricultural industry is larger than wheat, cotton, and tobacco.
The environment for the industry's growth, public awareness, and education has been enhanced by the nursery
20 21 22 23 24 25
inspection and licensing, certification, and quarantine programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state agricultural programs.
Mississippi's nursery industry ranks 30th nationally and is valued at $100 million.
Over 80 percent of the nursery stock produced in Mississippi is shipped outside the state.
Of course, on the other side of
38 1 2 3 4 5 6 the coin, 80 percent of the nursery stock that is procured by retail sales and all, within the state, is bought from outside of the state.
Efforts to eradicate the imported fire ant was attempted for years but has never been successful.
If you remember, our commissioner of agriculture, Jim Buck Ross,
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
operated one of the only state-operated fire ant plants, or insecticide plants, to control the imported fire ant, to furnish an insecticide to every citizen within the state to do his best to eradicate the pest.
Unfortunately, it was unsuccessful.
Nursery and greenhouse products have long been a significant focus of quarantine efforts by USDA.
The
14 15 16 17 18 19
imported fire ant quarantine includes explicit rules for protecting, certifying, and shipping fire-ant-free nursery and greenhouse plants.
Quarantine surveys, compliance monitoring, and enforcement responsibilities are shared by APHIS and the IFA-infested states.
We have observed funding reduced for the imported
20 21 22 23 24 25
fire ant quarantine program for years.
While operated at reduced funding, the states in the green industry was expected to do more to curb the spread of this pest.
Now there's an attempt to abolish the imported fire ant quarantine, and, I believe, at the expense of a thriving and a growing industry.
39 1 2 3 4 5 6 The green industry is growing rapidly and needs the continuity provided by the USDA-APHIS and plant protection and quarantine inspection programs.
Fortunately, USDA plant pest quarantines are uniform from state to state.
Unlike EPA pesticide laws, which vary from state to state, a state plant pest law can be no more restrictive than the
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
federal law.
This brings commonness to chaos.
Mississippi's favorable growing conditions offer an excellent environment for the pest to flourish.
The state of Mississippi was the leader in supplying fire ant poisons to eradicate the pest.
Without a favorable federal quarantine, many states may seek extreme measures to curb the spread of this pest.
The federal quarantine establishes
14 15 16 17 18 19
a framework for a coordinated, consistent approach to slowing the fire ant's spread.
Without USDA-APHIS's involvement, states will have to endure the burden alone in trying to deal with the pest.
For the nursery and greenhouse industry, the current quarantine efforts means one set of uniform rules
20 21 22 23 24 25
for shipping all types of nursery products interstate.
Revoking of the quarantine would influence uninfested states to promulgate and enforce their own rules, add an administrative burden to the states, and leave the industry struggling to comply with confusion and perhaps even conflicting demands for treating and certifying plants.
40 1 2 3 4 5 6 I would like to thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the Mississippi Nursery and Landscape Association on the USDA's imported fire ant quarantine.
And I won't read the Federal Register.
(Laughter.)
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Bill Brown, please.
MR. BROWN: Good morning.
My name is Bill Brown, and I'm general manager of Magnolia Gardens Nursery.
I also serve as a state director for the Texas Nursery and Landscape Association, representing Region II, which stretches from Beaumont to Brenham and from Madisonville to Galveston, and includes the Greater Houston metropolitan
14 15 16 17 18 19
area.
All of Region II is within the fire ant zone.
Magnolia Gardens was established in 1977.
The nursery consists of 175 acres in Waller and surrounding counties and currently has 140 employees.
Our product line includes trees, shrubs, ground covers, and perennials produced from a one-inch container to a 45-gallon container.
20 21 22 23 24 25
All plants grown in containers smaller than one gallon are sold through our liner division.
The liner division includes a tissue culture lab and over 500,000 square feet of greenhouse production area.
This division ships the majority of its product outside of the fire ant zone.
The primary customer base for this division is other
41 1 2 3 4 5 6 growers.
We ship products from this division 52 weeks a year via common carrier, airfreight, UPS, and on our own trucks.
The container division produces similar products in containers ranging from one gallon to 45 gallons.
This product is shipped primarily within the state of Texas.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Magnolia Gardens has a compliance agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture.
We are regularly inspected by the Texas Department of Agriculture.
Our control program for fire ants includes regular preventative treatment, as well as spot treatments when needed.
All shipments made outside the fire ant zone are drenched prior to shipment in the prescribed manner.
14 15 16 17 18 19
At Magnolia Gardens, we believe that the quarantine to slow the spread of imported fire ants is consistent with the executive order on invasive species and the growing congressional concern about this issue.
The cost to control imported fire ants at our nursery is over $6,500 per year.
Of the 2,114 growers in
20 21 22 23 24 25
Texas, 243 have fire ant compliance agreements, all are fighting the same battle, and with similar expenditures.
Other growers across the South have like problems and expenses.
We agree that imported fire ants are not only an invasive species, but also a human health threat.
We also
42 1 2 3 4 5 6 agree that a commitment to slow down the spread of imported fire ants is a legitimate public goal and a reasonable expenditure of public funds.
Without the quarantine, our nursery, as well as thousands of other nurseries across the South, would be put at an unfair competitive advantage.
If individual states
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
were in sole control of fire ant regulations for their state, it is conceivable and probable that a free-for-all could develop.
We believe that it is extremely likely that the controls would not be as effective or as fair as the system now in place.
We urge the restoration of the $7.5 million in funding for the United States Department of Agriculture-
14 15 16 17 18 19
APHIS fire ant line item to ensure a viable and effective quarantine.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
I'm going to check the registration table to see if there's any other registered speakers.
And after that,
20 21 22 23 24 25
we'll call nonregistered persons that wish to make a comment.
Bart Drees -- and I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.
MR. DREES: That's very close.
You did very well.
I had a little car trouble this morning, so I got in
43 1 2 3 4 5 6 a little late and missed some of the early presentations.
I'm Bart Drees.
I'm the coordinator for the Texas Fire Ant Project.
This is a $2.5 million a year project funded by the Texas Legislature initially in 1997, and it funds research, education, and regulatory programs in Texas by providing dollars to Texas A
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Experiment Station and Extension Service, University of Texas, Texas Tech University, and the Department of Agriculture.
We feel that the loss of funding, federal dollars, for the implementation of the quarantine will result in Texas having to pick up those support dollars to continue that program.
14 15 16 17 18 19
I'm also a member of the science panel that the California Department of Food and Agriculture brought into the state when they discovered red imported fire ants in Los Angeles and Riverside County, along with Mr. Homer Collins.
So we've seen firsthand what can happen when fire ants spread into new areas.
20 21 22 23 24 25
I think part of the discussion has centered around the fact that there's maybe very little land area, if you will, that's suitable for infestation by the red imported fire ant left to protect by causing the rest of the nation to pay the cost of protecting these areas.
I think one of the discussions I've heard in
44 1 2 3 4 5 6 California really rings true, and that is that the desert West really has changed quite a bit in these urban areas in Arizona, New Mexico, California, due to the -- and even West Texas -- the extensive irrigation in those areas has changed the habitat so that the potential areas of infestation, particularly in urban areas inhabited by man, which is the
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
reason this is a big medical problem and urban problem, is great.
And I don't think the work is yet done.
There's a lot of work that needs to be done, and I'm here to urge continued funding from the federal level to implement the USDA quarantine.
Let me give a couple of examples.
And I don't
14 15 16 17 18 19
want to reiterate what other speakers have presented this morning.
Certainly the nursery and greenhouse industry has been the focus of the quarantine, and here in Texas it's estimated we're spending of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in treatment costs alone to comply with the USDA quarantine.
But the quarantine treatment regulations
20 21 22 23 24 25
continue to evolve and change.
As an example, only last year did we see a new product registered called Distance Fire Ant Bait by Valent, that for the first time can be broadcast applied or used in greenhouse structures.
Before that, we had no baits that were legally available for use inside of greenhouses.
45 1 2 3 4 5 6 The collective efforts of Homer Collins's lab and the rest of the fire ant research in the Southeast is certainly responsible for bringing along these new products and treatment approaches.
I've been working with Alenash Bodkar [phonetic] and others at the Department of Agriculture because of the

issue that's recently arisen with the transport of bees to California specifically, and the complication where you have a distant quarantined county between nonquarantined areas or states where bee movement, in this case, is being implicated for transport of red imported fire ants into the almond orchards in California.
And this has cost a lot of money, caused a lot of unrest in the Texas Beekeepers Association.
14 15 16 17 18 19
We now have some Texas Fire Ant Project funds to address this issue, but the reality is that there is no treatment program similar to those that are available for greenhouses and nurseries in place currently to effectively assure that we're shipping fire-ant-free beehives.
Similarly, in hay production, although we do have
20 21 22 23 24 25
quarantine regulations that pertain to hay, there is no treatment for hay bales, either in the field or in storage, to assure that we're shipping fire-ant-free hay.
The only quarantine regulations in place are to remove and store offground bales, round or square bales, that are harvested prior to shipment.
46 1 2 3 4 5 6 This gives us a big problem during droughty years that we've experienced here in the last three years, the last three summers, where we have a major need to save cattle in West Texas and other western states, where we don't have hay to ship them because we can't assure that we can treat it and make those hay bales ant free.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
A third example is with the trucking industry.
I've worked with a manufacturer of shingles in Ennis, Texas, to try to work with them to develop a treatment program to treat flatbed trucks that are hauling plastic-wrapped shingles.
Again, here is an area that there's no treatment program in place.
We've had to do extensive label searches, and even when we get a treatment proposed and implemented,
14 15 16 17 18 19
there's no guarantee that the recipient state will accept those treatment records as an indication of fire-ant-free load.
As a consequence, a lot of these get turned back at the border, they get fumigated at the border, or otherwise they just are not meeting the ultimate goal of their shipping program.
20 21 22 23 24 25
Fire ants are undoubtedly a major urban pest, a medical pest that can cause serious repercussions to individuals, whether in urban or agricultural settings.
We need to maintain this support; in fact, we need to expand it to develop treatment programs for these other articles that I've discussed.
47 1 2 3 4 5 6 And probably the largest oversight, in my opinion, for the quarantine program is the lack of education programs in place to educate the shipping industry, the truckers, the rail industry.
There has been a program in the past, but in California, as an example, certainly nobody can really point a finger and say that that infestation in
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Riverside was the result of shipment of nursery stock.
In fact, there's good indication to believe that it was actually the importation of landscape articles that went into landscaping the neighborhood around the nursery that brought in infested material.
And that may or may not have been done by professionals.
That could very likely have been done by homeowners transporting plants from their
14 15 16 17 18 19
relatives in Florida to these other areas.
The general public is a major part in the shipment of fire-ant-infested articles, and we don't have the funding or support to address that huge need, which will continually represent a threat to continued spread, out West and to other noninfested areas, of the red imported fire
20 21 22 23 24 25
ant.
Thank you very much for letting me make these comments.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Dan Davidson, please.
MR. DAVIDSON: Thank you.
Is it okay to stand
48 1 2 3 4 5 6 here? MR. LIDSKY: Yes, sir.
MR. DAVIDSON: I am president of a small firm called Austin Tree Farm located right here in Austin.
Our farm is just east of the corporate limits of Austin, on the Colorado River.
We now farm 32 acres.
We have 20
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
additional acres under contract, and we ship trees currently primarily throughout Texas, Oklahoma, and certain bordering states.
We have sent trees as far away as North Carolina, Florida, Louisiana, and Arizona.
I spent 26 years in municipal government, and I particularly appreciate an effective, cooperative program between agencies, such as you have developed, for example,
14 15 16 17 18 19
with the Texas Department of Agriculture.
And as a small grower of balled and burlap field-grown products, that cooperative effort was extremely important to us in order to learn how to be in compliance with the fire ant program that you have established.
And I want to compliment you on that, and I certainly compliment the Texas Department of
20 21 22 23 24 25
Agriculture for this cooperative effort.
As a matter of fact, we had a representative from the Texas Department of Agriculture come to our farm at our request, and she inspected the farm, all 32 acres.
She gave us comments and recommendations as to how we might improve our maintenance program and the type of insecticide material
49 1 2 3 4 5 6 that could be used to fight the fire ants.
She also described for us what had to be done in order to achieve compliance with the fire ant program, in order to ship trees into other parts of Texas and into other states, which have not yet been overrun by the fire ant nuisance.
As a matter of fact, on the first -- she told us
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
that when we were ready to ship our first load of trees out of state or into one of these quarantined areas, we were to call her and ask that she come out and inspect what we had done to make sure that we were in compliance.
And since that first and subsequent treatments required three days minimum, she came out on all three days to make sure that we were doing it correctly.
14 15 16 17 18 19
To a small business, that's extremely important.
And she also explained the cooperative effort with the federal government, which I thought was very unusual.
One government is seemingly normally jealous or has some strong feelings about another one.
And I thought it was absolutely refreshing that this Texas Department of Agriculture
20 21 22 23 24 25
employee happened to be praising the efforts of the USDA in this cooperative venture.
I've noticed over the years since we started participation in the program and since we became certified, it's now much easier for us to control the fire ants.
And we're grateful to this program for teaching us how to do
50 1 2 3 4 5 6 that.
On the way to the farm, I drive by a pasture located on a major highway, and obviously no one has tried to control fire ants on that pasture.
And I would just estimate, gazing across the roadway and that pasture, that there are fire ant mounds every five to six feet on that
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
pasture.
And I can visualize what would happen if we did not have some control efforts underway between the federal government and the state of Texas in order to provide education, information, enforcement.
And I think it's a great benefit to our state.
Another major consideration for us is that as a small business, I'm not certain that we could keep up with
14 15 16 17 18 19
20 different standards that we might have to comply with if we did not have such a consistent regulation as you have provided at this time.
I don't think we could afford to stock that many different insecticides, or learn, or teach our employees that many different procedures, or teach our truckers that many different rules, as far as where you
20 21 22 23 24 25
stop, what you must show, how clean you have to keep your trucks, et cetera, for 20 different jurisdictions.
I think it would be an absolute nightmare.
And finally, I want to say that I think 7.5 million dollars is really a drop in the bucket compared to the strong benefits that this program is providing
51 1 2 3 4 5 6 throughout the United States.
And I feel that way as a small farmer located right here in Austin.
I feel that way -- by the way, I'm on the board of directors of the Texas Nursery and Landscape Association, as a grower representative.
And I feel that way as I talk to other growers throughout the state of Texas.
And I urge you to
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
exact every persuasion that you possibly can to see that funding can be restored to the federal government's portion of this fire ant quarantine program.
And with my compliments, I wish you luck, and I hope that you can bring back an effective funding that might even grow over subsequent years.
This is a very effective effort, one that's extremely unique in the cooperation that
14 15 16 17 18 19
you have with other states.
And we appreciate you and all that you're doing.
Thank you very much.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you very much.
Melinda Causey, please.
MS. CAUSEY: Good morning.
I'm Melinda Causey with Van Zyverden, Incorporated, out of Meridian,
20 21 22 23 24 25
Mississippi.
We're a wholesale distributor of flower bulbs, perennials, fruits, and vegetables.
We market our products throughout the United States, Canada, and several European countries.
We maintain a sales force to service every state in the United States, and we're the largest privately-owned bulb company in the United States, with sales exceeding over
52 1 2 3 4 5 6 $40 million.
Van Zyverden is also the largest green industry business in Mississippi, employing more than 350 individuals during the peak shipping seasons.
Our company operates under a compliance agreement with the USDA and the state of Mississippi that is accepted in all states.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Without a uniform quarantine, it would be impossible for us to comply with each state independently.
Inspections are routinely made of our facilities to ensure proper regulatory treatment is maintained, and all shipping cartons are properly identified with the federal and the state quarantine programs.
Efforts to eradicate the imported fire ant was
14 15 16 17 18 19
attempted for years but was never successful.
The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has maintained a quarantine to slow the spread to the uninfested areas by regulating the various means of spreading the pest.
Nursery and greenhouse products have long been a significant focus of quarantine efforts.
The IFA quarantine
20 21 22 23 24 25
includes explicit rules for protecting, certifying, and shipping the fire-ant-free nursery and greenhouse plants.
Quarantine surveys, compliance monitoring, and enforcement responsibilities are shared by the APHIS and the IFAinfested states.
We have observed funding reduced for the IFA
53 1 2 3 4 5 6 quarantine program for years.
While operating at reduced funding, the states and the green industry was expected to do more to curb the spread of this pest.
Now there is an attempt to abolish the imported fire ant quarantine, and I believe at the expense of the thriving and growing green industry.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
The green industry is growing rapidly and needs the continuity provided by the USDA, the APHIS, and the PP
Fortunately, the USDA plant pest quarantines are uniform from one state to the next.
Unlike the EPA pesticide laws, which vary from state to state, a state plant pest law can be no more restrictive than the federal law.
14 15 16 17 18 19
The federal quarantine does establish a framework for a coordinated, consistent approach to slowing the fire ant spread.
Without the USDA-APHIS involvement, the states will have to endure that burden alone, trying to deal with the fire ants.
Experience with several other quarantine pests
20 21 22 23 24 25
and noxious weeds has clearly demonstrated that meaningful federal participation enhances the effort.
States have varying resources and priorities, and if they are not uniform, one state's efforts is easily undermined by a neighboring state with a lax quarantine program.
Several factors associated with national commerce
54 1 2 3 4 5 6 in nursery stock, including short-interval delivery and brokerage, also contribute to a greater risk when certification and shipping regulations vary from state to state.
All this translates to a less effective effort to slow the IFA spread.
For the nursery and greenhouse industry, the
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
current quarantine effort means one set of uniform shipping rules for all types of nursery products, interstate.
This, of course, would be very valuable for our company.
Revocation of the quarantine would influence uninfested states to promulgate and enforce their own rules, adding an administrative burden to the states and leaving industries struggling to comply with confusing and possibly even
14 15 16 17 18 19
conflicting demands for treatment and certification.
Van Zyverden vigorously supports the continuation and adequate funding of the federal imported fire ant quarantine.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Thank you.
Is Martin Hubert present?
20 21 22 23 24 25
MR. HUBERT: Good morning.
My name is Martin Hubert, and as the deputy commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, I'm here representing the leading plant regulatory authority in the state of Texas.
Texas ranks second in the nation in agriculture, and our nursery industry ranks third in the state in total cash receipts.
55 1 2 3 4 5 6 Activities in agricultural industries are affected by the imported fire ant quarantine actions.
We applaud the USDA-APHIS PPQ for holding these meetings and permitting affected stakeholders to comment on the course of action that the agency should take in dealing with plant protection programs that affect us all.
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
The imported fire ant is an invasive insect pest accidentally introduced into the U.S. near Mobile, Alabama, during the 1920s.
Efforts to eradicate it continued until the 1970s but were unsuccessful.
The USDA's APHIS has maintained a quarantine to slow the spread of IFA to uninfested areas as a result of human activities.
The quarantine includes across-the-states uniform
14 15 16 17 18 19
rules for the shipment of fire-ant-free nursery and greenhouse plants.
Quarantine activities such as pest surveys, compliance monitoring, and enforcement of violations are shared by APHIS and the states.
However, the APHIS budget has been declining for years, and in fiscal year 2000 has been virtually eliminated.
This poses an
20 21 22 23 24 25
undue burden on states and the affected industries, and it may result in revocation of the federal fire ant quarantine altogether.
The importance of quarantine in facilitating interstate commerce while guarding the spread of IFA to free regions requires that federal funding assistance be restored.
56 1 2 3 4 5 6 The imported fire ant has spread throughout the Southeast from North Carolina to Florida, to eastern and central Texas.
Several counties in Southern California are also partly infested.
However, large areas of the United States, including Texas, are still IFA free and they would like to stay free of this significant human health and
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
agricultural pest as long as possible.
The quarantine allows for a coordinated, consistent, and uniform approach to slowing the spread of IFA.
Without USDA-APHIS involvement, states alone will have to endure the burden of trying to deal with this pest.
Currently, the nursery and greenhouse industry regards IFA quarantine as one set of uniform rules for shipping
14 15 16 17 18 19
interstate products.
The southern states and California are major production areas for nursery and greenhouse plants, growing billions of dollars' worth of trees, shrubs, flowers, and other plants.
Many of these plants are shipped to other parts of the country.
Revocation of the quarantine would
20 21 22 23 24 25
allow uninfested states to pass their own rules, leaving industry to comply with confusing, perhaps even conflicting demands for treating and certifying plants.
This concern became a reality for the Texas beekeeping industry this past year.
Beehives certified free of IFA using the accepted Texas protocol were regulated
57 1 2 3 4 5 6 differently by Arizona and other western states, resulting in an undue burden on the beekeeping industry.
TDA has consistently adopted the federal IFA quarantine under subchapter J of the Texas Administrative Code and continues to enforce a quarantine.
National concern over invasive species is at an all-time high.
The
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
imported fire ant is an invasive species of public health and agricultural concern.
Preventing or slowing its movement to many uninfested states is a shared goal and one that we believe the federal government should share regulatory funding for.
Already the infested states pick up most of the burden in costs of surveying, certifying crops, and
14 15 16 17 18 19
enforcing the quarantine.
Regulated nurseries spend tens of thousands of dollars each year to meet the quarantine specifications.
TDA agrees with the National Plant Board's position that $7.5 million should be funded by USDA-APHIS for a shared effort that will help fund critical surveys,
20 21 22 23 24 25
compliance monitoring, and enforcement assistance.
It will help ensure that fire-ant-free nursery and agricultural products are being transported and sold in the most viable markets.
This funding should be made available beginning fiscal year 2001.
And I have a copy of my comments.
58 1 2 3 4 5 6 MR. LIDSKY: Great.
Thank you.
Are there any persons who have not registered to speak that would like to enter comments into the record or ask questions of the panel? MR. EDMONDSON: This is Ed Edmondson, Texas Nursery and Landscape Association.
As far as a question for
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
the panel, can you sort of give us a thumbnail sketch of what the process is? I mean, I know this is the third hearing, and we have one more.
And then after that, what happens? MR. LIDSKY: Well, the comment period closes May 1.
After the comment period closes, all the comments will be carefully considered by the APHIS management team --
14 15 16 17 18 19
that's the deputy administrator and regional directors, along with the regional plant boards and the National Plant Board.
And they will make some type of a decision based on the comments.
I'm sure that if there are other persons that -such as members of Congress that need to be aware of your
20 21 22 23 24 25
concerns, those concerns would be taken into effect by them as well.
MR. EDMONDSON: But as far as a time line, you know, out there, when a decision will be made, is there a determination there? MR. LIDSKY: Well, where we're at now is hearings
59 1 2 3 4 5 6 were held the week of March 15 on the fiscal year 2001 budget.
Our administrator, Dr. Reed, testified before Congress.
And what happens between now and the end of the fiscal year, which is September 30, is Congress puts together a budget for the federal government.
As far as fiscal year 2000 goes, the situation
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
will not change.
For 2001, the situation is still fluid and could be affected by the budget process that's currently underway and possibly these hearings.
So how it will all come out in the wash is speculative and I wouldn't care to comment on it, but that's where we're at.
MR. EDMONDSON: All right.
I just wanted to make sure that we were talking about the 2001 year, as opposed to
14 15 16 17 18 19
the current year.
MR. LIDSKY: Yes, sir.
MR. EDMONDSON: Okay.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Mr. Collins, did you have any comments? MR. COLLINS: No.
There's a question in the
20 21 22 23 24 25
back.
MR. LIDSKY: Oh, I'm sorry.
Please come on up.
MR. DREES: I had a question that I don't know if the panel is able to address; perhaps Homer is.
But the funding this year, as I understand, is $100,000 nationally, and about half of that goes to Dona Ana County in New
60 1 2 3 4 5 6 Mexico.
Is there any -- can you let us know what activities those funds are going to support in New Mexico? MR. COLLINS: I believe it's primarily a survey.
MR. DREES: Okay.
MR. RICKS: Good morning.
My name is Phil Ricks.
I'm the district director for Congressman Henry Bonilla.
He
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
asked me to be here this morning.
As the district director, I run through Henry's 29 counties from here to El Paso and I get to dodge a lot of fire ants along the way.
Henry sits on the Appropriations Committee.
He sits on the Subcommittee on Agriculture.
So he has some direct oversight in terms of this issue, and he wanted me to let you know that he supports putting more
14 15 16 17 18 19
money from the federal government into this budget.
I'm not sure it would be the $7 million that the gentleman that spoke before me indicated, but that's something that Congress is, as you pointed out, looking into.
They are currently working on the budget for 2001 as we speak, and I will go back to him and let him know what
20 21 22 23 24 25
transpired here after talking to a few people.
And we will work towards whatever it is where the budget is falling short.
Again, I can't promise what that would be, nor could he at this point.
But he wanted me to come and lend his support.
Thank you.
MR. LIDSKY: Great.
Thank you very much, and
61 1 2 3 4 5 6 thank you for coming.
Are there any other persons that would like to make a comment? (No response.)
MR. LIDSKY: Ron, did you have any additional comments you'd like to make?
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
MR. MILBERG: No.
I just appreciate all the nurserymen, in particular, coming out.
I know this is a busy time of year, and I appreciate you being here.
MR. LIDSKY: I'd like to echo Ron's thoughts, and we do appreciate you taking the time to come out today, and we do appreciate the strong and unequivocal messages that have been entered into the record.
That's very helpful.
14 15 16 17 18 19
We've received a lot of useful information.
So if there are no other persons that would like to speak, we'll adjourn today's meeting.
Again, thank you.
(Whereupon, at 10:43 a.m., the meeting was concluded.)
