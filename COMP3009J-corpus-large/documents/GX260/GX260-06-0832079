Aquatics grow in an area know as the littoral zoneâ€”the shallow zone between dry land and the open water area of a lake.
In Minnesota waters, the littoral zone extends from the shore to a depth of about 15 feet, depending on water clarity.
The zone width varies, depending upon whether the shoreline slopes are steep or shallow.
There are four major aquatic plant categories, each favoring a certain water depth; however, the growing areas may overlap.
Plant growth can vary greatly from lake to lake and even within a lake.
Aquatic plants provide food and habitat for many animals.
<
There are different types of algae, some grow only in the littoral zone, while others grow beyond in well-lit surface waters of an entire lake.
Examples: Spirogyra (filamentous algae).
<
Flowers and seeds on short stems that extend above the water may also be present.
They grow from near the shore to the deepest part of the littoral zone.
Depending on the species, they may form a low growing â€œmeadowâ€� near the lake bottom, grow with lots of open space between plant stems, or form dense stands or mats.
Examples: Myriophyllum spicatum (Eurasian watermilfoil) and Vallisneria americana (wild celery).
<
They grow in protected areas where there is little wave action.
Example: Nymphaea sp. (white water lily) and Nelumbo lutea (yellow lotus).
<
They typically grow in wetlands and along shorelines where water is less than four feet deep.
Examples: Typha angustifolia (narrow-leaved cattail) and scirpus sp. (bulrush).
<
<
There are many different types of lights, including mercury vapor, high-pressure sodium vapor, incandescent, metal halide, and fluorescent.
Some plants are sensitive to one light type and not another.
A primary symptom of adverse light effects is extending many plantsâ€™ growth, thereby delaying dormancy and proper hardening off.
As a result, plants are susceptible to autumn frosts and winter cold injury.

Picloram and clopyralid are included for information only.
<
It is used for broadleaf weed control in lawns, grounds maintenance in intensively managed turf, and for broadleaf brush control in extensively managed areas including utility and transportation corridors.
Evidence of 2,4-D damage is twisting of any woody plant part, epinasty, and/or distorted leaf growth.
Indicators of 2,4-D use include turf areas free of dandelions, small grain fields free of mustard, or a known history of using products with 2,4-D as an ingredient.
<
It is commonly used in combination with other broadleaf herbicides (e.g. Trimec) in intensively managed turf areas for controlling chickweed, creeping Charlie, and other hard to control broadleaf weeds.
Vanquish is a trade name for a formulation of dicamba used in extensively managed areas for controlling broadleaf weeds such as water hemlock.
Evidence of dicamba damage is arrested leaf expansion and shoot elongation, unopened buds, and chlorotic, dwarfed, or distorted leaves.
Indicators of potential dicamba use include turf areas that are generally free of dandelions and/or the presence of adjacent cornfields.
<
It is used to control most annual and perennial broadleaf plants, including woody material.
Evergreen trees and shrubs are susceptible to picloram.
Most grasses are resistant at low rates, though at high rates picloram acts as a soil sterilant.
It is the preferred herbicide for controlling leafy spurge and Canada thistle in extensively managed areas due to its effectiveness and low cost.
Pilcoram application within the root zone of desirable woody plants may cause death or severe injury.
Indicators of potential picloram use include dried thistle and leafy spurge stocks or stressed grass, showing a range of color from green to yellow to orange.
<
It controls many broadleaf plants, especially composites and legumes.
It is the preferred herbicide for controlling Canada thistle in informal landscape settings; when applied at the low application rates, it causes minimal damage to desirable woody plants.
Clopyralid is used for prairie establishment site preparation in areas infested with Canada thistle, birdsfoot trefoil, and crown vetch.
For crown vetch control, clopyralid must be used one season prior to seeding prairie grasses and forbs in order to minimize the death of emerging prairie seedlings.
Clopyralid is an active ingredient in a mixture with Triclopyr (Garlon) sold under the trade name Confront.
Confront is used as a broadleaf weed killer in turf, including lawns and grounds maintenance.
Most woody plants are resistant to Confront; however, linden trees and sumac shrubs can show season-long leaf curling, even when applied at the manufacturerâ€™s label rates.

Soil moisture regimes range from soils with groundwater on the surface part of the year to those with unavailable water much of the year.
Regimes are based mainly on the number of consecutive days that the soil control section (soil depth from about 4â€� to 12â€�) is dry.
Factors such as runoff, climate, drainage, and slope direction contribute to the soil moisture regime.
Sometimes referred to as xeric.
This is the most commonly found soil moisture regime.
Sometimes referred to as mesic.
Sometimes referred to as hydric.
<
<
The blue to green color range indicates long periods of waterlogged conditions.
Mottled soils are not conducive to proper plant growth.

Standing water is usually present during floods and snowmelt.
Inland fresh meadows include sedge meadows, fresh (wet) meadows, low prairies, and calcareous fens. 
Marshes may be deep or shallow.
<
The soils are saturated during much of the growing season and may be inundated by as much as a foot of standing water.
Coniferous swamp soils are usually organic (peat/muck) with variable pH and nutrient levels.

Symptoms vary with each plant species.
For example, alfalfa shows a bleaching appearance between leaf veins as well as on leaf margins; bracken fern shows orange-red on the margins of the frond (leaf); white birch and aspen show reddish-brown (darkening with age) inter-veinalInter-veinal and leaf margin injury; and white and jack pine show orange-red colored needles.
All of these plants are considered good indicator plants of SO2 injury.
<
<
<
On a world-wide basis, bacteria produce about ten times more NO than the combined total of NO and NO2 emissions related to human activities.
The indirect effect of NOX on vegetation, through its key role in forming highly phototoxic photochemical oxidants like ozone, is more important than its direct effects.
The direct effects are usually in localized areas only and are not common.
Symptoms vary from species to species and even from cultivar to cultivar, within a species.
There are no common plants that serve as biological indicators.
Chronic exposure to NO2 produces chlorosis and necrosis.
The damage can easily be confused with other pollutants or nutrient deficiencies.
<
Hydrocarbons arise during the incomplete combustion of petroleum products, of which transportation sources account for more than half of the total emissions.
The most common symptoms on broadleaf plants are small flecks or stipples visible on the upper leaf surface.
The most common symptoms on grasses and grains are small chlorotic spots or white flecks between the veins.
Symptoms commonly observed on coniferous plants include â€œchlorotic mottlesâ€� (small patches of yellow tissue surrounded by healthy green tissue) and â€œtipburn.â€�
Symptoms on broadleaf plants include chlorosis (yellowing or paling of green parts of plants) and/or necrosis (death of tissue).
The symptoms start at the leaf tip and extend toward the base of the leaf from the tip or toward the middle of the leaf from the margins.
The most popular biological indicator of fluoride effects is gladiolus, which shows necrosis of some outer portions of the leaf.
Coniferous plants also show necrosis of the outer portions, or tip, of the needle.

Some plants tolerate salt spray better than others.
Relative plant tolerances are defined as follows: 
Evergreen trees exhibit needle browning, reduced growth, and may eventually die.
Plants rarely flower.

These soils may be slightly saline (2-8 mmhos/cm electrical conductivity).
<
<
Included are soils with organic surfaces up to 16 inches thick.
<
Spring planting may be delayed because of wet conditions.
Seedling mortality may be moderate in WSG-2K because the free carbonates in these soils can tie up minerals and limit their availability.
<
permeability is moderate or moderately slow.
These soils lack free carbonates in the upper 20 inches and are non- saline.
<
<
Some of these soils have a moderately high water table.
There are three subgroups.
<
<
<
<
Water erosion will be severe on slopes greater than 10% in WSG-4C, while it will be severe only on slopes greater than 15% in WSG-4L and WSG-4F.
<
These are predominantly fine sandy loam or sandy loam soils, but include soils with a sandy mantle over loamy material.
<
Some vegetative cover should be left during the early years of establishment on the soils with a sandy mantle over loamy materials; they are subject to soil blowing.
The soils with a sandy mantle over loamy material will also have moderate seedling mortality because of some moisture stress in the seedling.
<
They have low to moderate water holding capacities.
There are two subgroups.
<
<
<
<
These are predominantly shallow soils with loamy sand or coarser textures and soils shallow (10â€� to 20â€�) to sand or gravel.
<
Water erosion will be severe on slopes greater than 15%.
Some vegetative cover should be left during the early years of establishment because of the blowing soil.
<
<
Water erosion will be severe on slopes greater than 15%.
<
<
The species listed are those that would have some possibility of survival where barnyard drainage is or has taken place recently.
<
One or more characteristics such as soil depth, texture, wetness, available water capacity, slope, or salts severely limit tree or shrub planting, survival, or growth.
Onsite investigations may reveal that tree and shrubs plantings can be accomplished with special treatment.
<

<
It is caused by great fluctuations in winter temperatures.

In the winter, texture is a product of the size, surface, spacing, grouping, and character of stems, and persisting seeds or leaves.
Some plants are fine, medium, or coarse all year, while others are fine or medium in summer, yet coarse in winter.
This definition considers a plantâ€™s overall appearance--how a plant is generally seen in the landscape.
