Issued by the Department of Transportation on the 10th day of June, 1998
Applications of ICELANDAIR (Flugleidir Hf.) PREMIAIR A/S TURKISH AIRLINES (TURK HAVA YOLLARI A.O.) Dockets OST-97-2634 OST-97-2166 OST-97-2407
for foreign air carrier permits under section 41301 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code
ORDER ISSUING FOREIGN AIR CARRIER PERMITS The captioned applicants seek foreign air carrier permits under section 41301 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code in the indicated dockets.
The applications are fully described in attachments to this order.
Because the public interest bases for granting these applications are clear, the applicants' fitness is established by evidence of record and unchallenged, and there are no significant ownership and control questions, it is appropriate to use this simplified, Subpart Q procedure to grant the requested authority.
1
1
14 CFR 302.1701 et seq.
Under Rule 29(b), we may, in our discretion, omit a tentative decision in proceedings under Subpart Q and proceed directly to a final decision.
ach applicant has filed and perfected its application as required by 14 CFR Part 211 and served it as required by 14 CFR 302.1705.
Each application was summarized in the Federal Register, as cited in its descriptive attachment, and in the Department's published weekly list of applications filed.
These notices described the authority sought and gave interested persons an opportunity to submit evidence and objections to the award of the authority.
No answers to these applications were filed.
Public Interest We find that grant of these foreign air carrier permits is in the public interest, and that each applicant is qualified to conduct the proposed operations.
The authority we are granting is provided for in the Air Transport Services Agreement between the United States and the applicant's homeland, and each carrier has been designated by its government under that agreement.
In each case where charter authority is conferred, that authority is consistent with our foreign carrier charter rule, 14 CFR Part 212.
2 Operational and Financial Fitness Except as noted, each carrier has demonstrated that it is financially, managerially, and operationally fit to perform the foreign air transportation proposed.
The applicants already have operated successfully to this country under previously issued authority.
They have furnished financial information and/or evidence of government backing which indicates that they can operate without jeopardizing passenger or shipper funds.
We have reviewed each applicant's evidence of managerial/operational fitness, and have consulted the Federal Aviation Administration with respect to each.
Each applicant has shown by its evidence, its history of operations to this country, and/or other officially noticeable information, that it has competent management and can operate safely.
Each holds effective authority from its homeland government for the operations proposed and states that it has had no safety or tariff violations in the preceding five years.
The FAA has advised us that each applicant conducts its operations to this country in accordance with Part 129 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.
Ownership and Control Except as noted, each applicant has submitted evidence to establish that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled by nationals, or the Government, of its claimed homeland.
To the extent a question may exist concerning non-homeland involvement in the applicants, we find that waiver of our ownership and control standard, to the extent necessary, is warranted.
There is no evidence that the ownership and control of the carriers would make grant of this authority inimical to U.S. aviation policy or interests.
2
Under Part 212, unless otherwise ordered by the Department (or, previously, by the CAB), any foreign air carrier whose permit authorizes charters may perform Third and Fourth Freedom charters without limitation or specific prior approval, and may perform Fifth Freedom charters upon obtaining a specific statement of authorization from the Department.
Terms, Conditions and Limitations Each foreign air carrier permit is subject to the terms, conditions and limitations we consistently impose in the public interest.
Since the authority is provided for in a bilateral agreement, the permit is made coextensive with that agreement.
Pendente Lite Exemptions Each carrier is operating under current exemption authority.
Those exemptions will expire by their own terms 90 days after we submit this order for review under section 41307 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code.
Findings and Conclusions In view of the foregoing, and all the facts of record, we find and conclude that: 1.
It is in the public interest to issue a foreign air carrier permit to each applicant in the form attached; 2.
To the extent the authority conferred is the subject of a bilateral agreement, each applicant is qualified and designated by its government under the applicable agreement; 3.
Each applicant is fit, willing and able to perform properly the foreign air transportation described in its attached permit, and to conform to the provisions of the U.S. Code and to the Department's rules, regulations, and requirements; 4.
The public interest requires that the exercise of the privileges granted by the attached permits be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in and attached to those permits and to such others required by the public interest as the Department may prescribe; 5.
Each applicant is substantially owned and effectively controlled by nationals, or the Government, of its respective homeland; or that waiver of our ownership and control standard, to the extent necessary, is warranted; 6.
The issuance of these permits does not constitute a "major regulatory action" under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, as defined in subsection 313.4(a)(1) of the Department's Regulations; 3 and 7.
The public interest does not require an oral evidentiary hearing on any of these applications.
3
Our finding is based on the fact that each permit issued will not result in a near-term increase in annual fuel consumption by the applicant in excess of 10 million gallons.
ACCORDINGLY, 1.
We issue, in the forms attached, a foreign air carrier permit to each applicant; 2.
We grant all motions and requests to file documents out of time, to submit additional or supplementary materials, and to withdraw pleadings; 3.
To the extent not granted, the applications and all motions and other requests in these dockets are denied; 4.
Unless disapproved by the President of the United States under section 41307 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code, this order and the attached permits shall become effective on the 61st day after their submission for section 41307 review, or upon the date of receipt of advice from the President or his designee under Executive Order 12597 and implementing regulations that he or she does not intend to disapprove the Department's order under that section, whichever occurs earlier; 4 and 5.
We will serve this order on the applicants and other parties in these dockets.

In this condition, the term "international air transportation" means "international transportation" as defined by the Warsaw Convention, except that all States shall be considered to be High Contracting Parties for the purpose of this definition; (8) Except as specifically authorized by the Department, originate or terminate all flight to/from the United States in its homeland; (9) Comply with the requirements of 14 CFR Part 217, concerning the reporting of scheduled, nonscheduled, and charter data; (10) If charter operations are authorized, comply with the Department's rules governing charters (including 14 CFR Parts 212 and 380); and (11) Comply with such other reasonable terms, conditions, and limitations required by the public interest as may be prescribed by the Department, with all applicable orders or regulations of other U.S. agencies and courts, and with all applicable laws of the United States.

Foreign Air Carrier Permit Application of PREMIAIR A/S Docket OST-97-2166 Flag: Denmark Federal Register Notice: 62 FR 11512, March 12, 1997 Filing Date: February 28, 1997 Authority Sought: Initial foreign air carrier permit to engage in charter foreign air transportation of persons, property and mail between Denmark/Norway/Sweden and the United States, and other charters pursuant to 14 CFR 212 of the Department's regulations.
Pleadings: No answers were filed.
Public Interest: The Air Transport Services Agreement between the United States and Denmark provides for the requested U.S.-Denmark charter authority, and Premiair has been properly designated by its homeland to conduct these operations.
Consistent with our past treatment of Scandinavian carriers, we will also permit Premiair to conduct charter services between Norway/Sweden and the United States (see, for example, Order 82-4-58 at 4, and Orders 90-4-45, 87-8-55 and 82-11-58).
Fitness: Premiair was established in 1994 as a result of the consolidation of two Scandinavian charter air carriers (Scanair and A/S Conair) both of which were based in Denmark and held foreign air carrier permits (see Orders 90-4-45 and 92-11-37).
Premiair currently holds exemption authority to conduct the requested services (see Order 97-8-12).
The carrier is properly licensed by its homeland, has had no safety violations or fatal accidents since commencing operations, has experienced management, and appears financially sound: Financial Indicators ($ thousands) as of: Total Assets Total Liabilities Owners' Equity Operating Profit (year ending) 9/31/96 $135,078 136,984 (1,906) 11,109 12/31/95 $69,583 60,401 9,182 (859)
DOT verifies compliance with 14 CFR 203 (Warsaw liability waiver), 205 (insurance requirement, and 129 (FAA operations specifications).
Ownership and Control: Premiair, which is owned through a series of 100% wholly-owned subsidiaries, by Air Tours, Plc, a publicly-held U.K. corporation with significant U.K. citizen ownership and representation on the board of directors, requested a waiver of our citizenship requirements.
We will grant the carrier's request.
Despite the presence of non-homeland interests, we find that there is nothing in the ownership and control of the carrier that would be inimical to U.S. aviation policy or interests.
Therefore, we conclude that waiver of our standard requirement that substantial ownership and effective control of a foreign carrier rest in the hands of citizens of its homeland is warranted.
