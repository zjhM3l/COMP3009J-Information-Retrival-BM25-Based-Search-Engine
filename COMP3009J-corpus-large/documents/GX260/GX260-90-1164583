T HE M INERAL INDUSTRY OF PENNSYLVANIA This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Geological Survey and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.
In 2000, the estimated value1 of nonfuel mineral production for Pennsylvania was $1.25 billion, based upon preliminary U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data.
This was about a 1.6% increase from that of 1999.2 For the fifth consecutive year, the State was 11th in the Nation in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which Pennsylvania accounted for more than 3% of the U.S. total.
(Data for industrial sand and gravel and tripoli have been withheld from table 1 for 1999 and 2000 to protect company proprietary data, resulting in total values that are less than the actual totals for those years.)
In 2000, Pennsylvania continued to be among the Nation's 1 _____________ The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending upon the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 2000 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of July 2001 and are expected to change.
For some mineral commodities, such as construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement, estimates are updated periodically.
To obtain the most current information, please contact the appropriate USGS mineral commodity specialist.
A telephone listing of the specialists may be retrieved over the Internet at URL http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/contacts/comdir.html, by using MINES FaxBack at (703) 648-4999 from a fax machine with a touchtone handset (request Document #1000 for a telephone listing of all mineral commodity specialists), or by calling USGS information at (703) 648-4000 for the specialist's name and number.
All Mineral Industry Surveys--mineral commodity, State, and country--also may be retrieved over the Internet at URL http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals; facsimile copies may be obtained from MINES FaxBack.
2 Values, percentage calculations, and rankings for 1999 may vary from the Minerals Yearbook, Area Reports: Domestic 1999, Volume II, owing to the revision of preliminary 1999 to final 1999 data.
Data for 2000 are preliminary and are expected to change; related rankings may also change.
leading States that produce crushed stone, portland cement, lime, and masonry cement (descending order of value); these four commodities accounted for nearly 90% of the State's total nonfuel mineral production value.
Construction sand and gravel, Pennsylvania's other major nonfuel mineral, accounted for most of the remaining 10%.
In 1999, increases in the production and value of portland and masonry cements, up a combined $27 million, accounted for the largest additions to the State's mineral economy.
A significant increase also occurred in dimension stone production and value, while industrial sand and gravel and peat also showed small increases in value (descending order of change).
These were offset in part, mostly by decreases in the (production and) values of crushed stone and lime.
Smaller decreases also occurred in common clays, construction sand and gravel, kaolin, and tripoli (table1).
Based upon USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the 50 States in 2000, Pennsylvania remained second in crushed stone, third in portland cement, fourth of 4 States that produce tripoli, sixth in lime and masonry cement, and eighth in dimension stone.
Additionally, significant quantities of construction sand and gravel, industrial sand and gravel, and common clays were produced in the State (descending order of value).
Pennsylvania is exclusively an industrial mineral- and coalproducing State; metals that were produced in the State in 2000, especially steel, were processed from materials acquired from foreign and other domestic sources.
Pennsylvania continued to be the Nation's third leading raw-steel-manufacturing State, with an estimated output of almost 7.2 million metric tons of raw steel, as reported by the American Iron and Steel Institute.
