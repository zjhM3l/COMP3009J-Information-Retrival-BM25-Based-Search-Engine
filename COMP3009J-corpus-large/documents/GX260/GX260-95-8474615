ECUTIVE SUMMARY The Desert Region Spotlight on Conservation workshop, held in Victorville on January 16 Â­ 17, 2003, was the fifth in the series of nine bioregional workshops.
As shown on the maps below, this region included portions of Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernadino, and San Diego counties.
The contents of this report cover: 1.
Legacy goals, workshop results, and follow-up actions 2.
A general summary of workshop highlights and events 1.
Detailed transcriptions, maps, and preliminary analysis resulting from the workshop.
The Spotlight on Conservation workshop series is based on the premise that the best way to develop a statewide conservation strategy is to engage with the varied communities throughout our state to understand the unique natural and working landscapes in each bioregion.
The California Legacy Project is holding nine bioregional workshops across the State in 2002 Â­ 2003.
This will provide a better understanding of the resources highly valued in the region and the strategies for conservation investment that best fit each region.

The workshops were designed to accomplish the following goals: 1.
Put a spotlight on land and water conservation throughout the state; 2.
Introduce the Legacy Project to regional conservation stakeholders; 3.
Elicit information about existing regional conservation plans and priorities; monitoring, management and stewardship projects; and available data sets and; 4.
Gain a sense of the participant's high priorities for conservation including the criteria they might use for investing in conservation of various resources, and the strategies they believe most applicable to their region and interests.
GOALS, RESULTS, AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS In support of these goals, results and followup actions are summarized below: 1.
Spotlight conservation: A diverse group of people who work on and are affected by conservation had the opportunity to hear each other's views and to interact.
People from different parts of the region had an opportunity to share information and think about the region and the State as a whole.
To follow-up, participants can add themselves to the email list for Legacy's on-line newsletter, The Watering Hole [http://legacy.ca.gov/subscribe.epl].
Also, the Legacy Project staff distributed a participant contact list and will distribute workshop results to participants for review prior to publication.
able to highlight their valuable work in the region at display booths and in workshop sessions.
3.
Elicit information: Participants viewed maps of statewide and regional datasets (e.g. land cover types, publicly owned conservation lands, etc.) for a broad view of resources.
Legacy staff received contacts for important local datasets and access to data sharing.
Participants identified local monitoring, restoration, and stewardship projects, and conservation planning efforts.
Legacy Project staff gained a better sense of places in the region that are high conservation priorities.
For follow up, regional maps presented at the workshops and additional information received will be evaluated for inclusion in the web-based California Digital Conservation Atlas [http://legacy.ca.gov/new_atlas.epl].
Sharing this information with state agencies will enable them to consider existing local and regional plans and recommended regional priorities when determining statewide priorities for investment.
Gain insight on regional perspectives: In break-out groups, participants were asked to identify regional planning needs; ways in which the State could provide support to regional conservation; and the greatest needs or next steps for implementing existing plans.
Gain insight on regional conservation investment strategies: In break-out groups, participants were asked to identify regional conservation priorities and specific strategies that can offer mutual benefit to conservation and local economies.
For follow-up, Legacy staff will review differences in sub-regional and region-to Â­region strategies and will attempt to determine how these differences can be taken into account in developing conservation investment strategies at the state level.
2.
Introduce the Legacy Project: Participants had the opportunity to ask substantial and challenging questions about the Legacy Project.
They appreciated the interest expressed regarding their views about State conservation investment strategies.
Resource Agency departments were also

INFORMATION EXCHANGE One of the key components of the workshop is an "Information Exchange" gallery where participants share detailed knowledge of the area's conservation efforts and their regional and statewide conservation priorities.
It is set up as an open house of interactive stations focused on specific conservation-related questions.
Here are the results of the six stations.
1.
Data available and data needs: Participants viewed Legacy's existing regional and statewide maps depicting natural resources datasets, and land ownership and land use boundaries.
Data available will help inform the regional and local database survey and will be added to California Environmental Resources Evaluation System (CERES) [http://ceres.ca.gov].
Existing and emerging conservation planning efforts: Of the 21 on-going conservation planning efforts, nearly half were identified as addressing more than one resource type.
Conservation of Aquatic Biodiversity or water resources was cited as an important goal for eight of the 21 programs (38%).
Four of the plans focus on military installations.
Rare or sensitive species are noted as the primary focus of three of the plans.
This input will be complied into regional maps of existing and emerging conservation plans and areas of conservation interest.
These maps will be evaluated before possible inclusion in the web-based Conservation Atlas.
Regional conservation priorities: Of the 80 locations identified, the Salton Sea was given the greatest amount of attention (receiving more dots than any other location).
Many of the other chosen areas centered on habitat linkages, riparian areas, endangered species habitat, and areas threatened by development.
Additional notable areas included the Amaragosa River, wildlife corridors adjacent to Joshua Tree National Park, and dune habitats in Imperial County.
Statewide conservation priorities: The majority of places identified as statewide priorities were located between Los Angeles and San Diego, in the South Coast region.
Clusters of priority sites centered around the San Gabriel Mountains, the Santa Clara River headwaters, the city of San Diego, and the Amargosa River.
On a statewide basis, habitat linkages; threatened, endangered and sensitive species' protection; management of water resources; and agricultural concerns were repeatedly cited as important concerns.
In summary, through the Spotlight on Conservation Workshop series, the California Legacy Project is trying to combine input from state departments, boards and conservancies as well as local government and private stakeholders in developing a statewide conservation investment strategy.
This workshop has specifically allowed the Resources Agency to learn about important local and regional values, data, plans, and priorities in the Desert Bioregion.

I. INTRODUCTION This Interim Report is a summary of the California Legacy Project Spotlight on Conservation workshop held in Victorville for the Desert bioregion.
This workshop was the fifth in a series of nine workshops to be held throughout the State in 2002-2003.
Participating counties included Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernadino, and San Diego.
The Interim Report is a record of the workshop results and provides some preliminary analysis.
In an effort to develop California's firstÂ­ever statewide resources conservation strategy, " he California Legacy Project will assist everyone who knows the land and is working to save it.
We're making an unprecedented effort to reach out to those who care about the future of California's natural resources.
I invite you to get involved in this exciting effort to work with us on the state-of-the-art tools and conservation strategies that will help protect and restore California's natural resources and working landscapes."
the California Legacy Project is working with Resources Agency state departments, boards, commissions and conservancies, CALEPA departments, the California Department of Food and Agriculture, the Governor's Office of Planning and Research, and federal and nonprofit conservation partners.
The Project seeks the input of stakeholders affected by conservation investment, as well as of advocates for conservation investment.
The Legacy Project will create analytical tools that can help state and federal agencies; local and regional governments; and public and private groups assess resource values and risks, and conservation opportunities for large landscape areas in each of the state's major bioregions.
Such evaluations guide decisionmakers to more effective and strategic allocations of funds.
The California Legacy Project includes a wide range of perspectives and incorporates agency and public participation at all levels of its work.
It builds on existing data and conservation efforts, facilitating partnerships in data improvement and conservation actions.
Working together with a host of partners, the Project helps to ensure a legacy of natural resources and working landscapes for California's future.

SESSION RESULTS WORKSHOP OVERVIEW Eighty-seven people attended the workshop.
All workshop invitees are recommended to Legacy staff as being knowledgeable about and interested in regional conservation and natural resource issues.
In extending invitations, we attempt to be thorough and to include a broad spectrum of viewpoints and expertise, but we recognize that our participant groups ultimately represent a relatively small, self-selected, focus group.
Thus, we recognize that the recorded responses are not representative of the public, or even of natural resources professionals as a whole.
The workshop is designed for one and a half days and has two distinct, but equally important, components: (1) a series of facilitated discussions in large and small groups, and (2) an "Information Exchange," set up in an open house format, where participants view and react to an extensive gallery of maps and data and provide Legacy with detailed information on conservation-related questions.
Day One begins with a welcome, a presentation about the Legacy Project, and a presentation about current, large-scale, planning efforts in the region that is intended to set the context for follow-up conversations.
Participants then discuss regional conservation issues in a facilitated large group session.
Day One ends with a 2-hour opportunity to engage in the "Information Exchange" and provide detailed input.
Day Two begins with small break-out group discussions.
At previous "Spotlight on Conservation" workshops, participants discussed the types of criteria they would use in deciding how and where to invest in conservation.
However, given the extent of large-scale conservation planning that has already taken place in the desert bioregion1, a criteria-generating exercise was deemed unnecessary.
Instead, participants discussed regional perspectives on conservation planning progress and needs.
In the afternoon, following a brief presentation on the California Digital Conservation Atlas, participants convene in small groups for discussions of strategies that offer mutual benefit to local economic objectives as well as resource conservation.
Participants then return to large group for reports back on the results of the small groups sessions.
Finally, the workshop closes with a summary of workshop highlights and with a closing address by a Resources Agency official.
For a detailed Workshop Agenda see Appendix A. WORKSHOP OPENING To open the workshop, Ron Rempel, Deputy Director, Habitat Conservation Division, California Department of Fish and Game, welcomed participants.
Rempel noted the effort being made by the Legacy project to reach out to landowners, conservation organizations, business interests, and government agencies.
He also commended the Legacy Project's scope, including not only biodiversity, but also rural recreation opportunities and working landscapes, as well as the broad range of conservation tools the project supports, including not only acquisition, but also private land stewardship and restoration.
In particular, he acknowledged the importance of stewardship incentive programs and recognized the value of working lands not only as habitat and open space, but also as they support regional heritage and economy.
He recognized the tremendous amount of effort that has already gone into large-scale conservation plans in the Desert region.
Acknowledging that the plans balance many competing interests and that there are some disagreements over that balance, Rempel explained that the Legacy Project hoped to focus on the positive investments the State could make to move forward the actions on which there is consensus and to achieve the key steps that need to be taken to reach long-term goals.
Following Ron Rempel's remarks, David Widell, Deputy Director, Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation Division, CA Department
PROCEEDINGS OF DESERT REGION SPOTLIGHT ON CONSERVATION WORKSHOP

of Parks and Recreation, spoke about the Division's work in the desert region.
He noted that many Resources Agency and Legacy Project goals, including developing collaborative partnerships, working to identify priority areas, and building on local efforts, have proven important for on-the-ground projects.
As an example of what can be done to balance off road recreational demand and species' protection, he described the Western Riverside Partnership between the Off Highway Division of State Parks and the
Department of Fish and Game.
State Parks will develop an Off Highway Vehicle park on land that it has held for some time.
In return for developing that park, it will protect (at a 6 to 1 ratio) habitat for rare species that is now being used illegally for off road vehicle activity.
In conclusion, Widell observed that with increasing population pressure (and Offhighway vehicle opportunity demands), it becomes more important to have accurate assessments, good data, and strong partnerships.

Dick Crowe, Resource Management Specialist, Desert District, Bureau of Land Management, presented the following information on the Proposed Northern and Eastern Colorado Desert Coordinated Management Plan and Final Environmental Impact Statement (U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management): Major Plan Scoping Issues/ Proposals include: - Tortoise Recovery - Establish large recovery units, called Desert Wildlife Management Areas (DWMAs) and - -
- - -
designate as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern.
Enact 1% surface disturbance limitation on Federal lands (not including grazing, fire, light disturbance).
Bighorn Sheep - Meta-population management via 2 Wildlife Habitat Management Areas (WHMA).
Focus on mitigation and maintenance of connectivity.
Review maintenance of artificial drinkers in wilderness areas.
Other Species - Establish multi-species WHMAs for total of 60 special status species and their habitats to cover 80% of species ranges.
WHMA location criteria: 1) excludes high value uses areas, 2) provides connectivity to restricted areas and DWMAs, 3) choose areas where the most species occur in the least area.
Wild Burros Â­ Establish 2 Habitat Management Areas on Colorado River, reduce some management areas.
Routes Designation - Inventory all routes, considering species proximity and redundancy.
95% of roads proposed to remain open, 5% closed.
Close 5- - 75% of driveable washes in Desert Wildlife Management Areas.
Land Tenure Adjustment Â­ Acquire lands within and dispose of federal lands outside DWMAs/ WHMAs.
Rationale for Proposed Plan - Desert Wildlife Management Areas (DWMAs) Â­ The large size (50% larger than minimum Desert Tortoise Recovery Plan recommended) should reduce effects of allowed uses.
- - -
Cattle Grazing - perennial grazing continues based on science review, but ephemeral grazing is eliminated and forage priority is given to tortoise.
Routes, Washes, Vehicle Events, OHV Open Areas, Burros - agreement among collaborators.
Land Tenure Adjustment - approach would be win-win for Federal Lands management and private uses if can accomplish through land exchange.
Approved Plan -
The Approved Plan will be published for public distribution once the other California Desert Plan Amendment Plans have been completed and all plans have been reviewed for consistency.

REGIONAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES As part of the first day of the workshop, participants were challenged to identify some of the most pressing issues for conservation in Desert region including unique regional opportunities and challenges.
Participants detailed a host of regional challenges including: striking a balance between recreation and conservation, population growth and increasing pressures on air quality and water resources, and needs for sound stewardship.
Opportunities to improve upon these conditions were also presented, many of which centered on partnerships for planning, management, and OPPORTUNITIES Use desert advisory groups Smart growth in urban areas e.g. Riverside County process Volunteer help, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) and academics Compliance through education; provide interpretive information on the desert and disseminate information better Better outreach and communication to local communities Inform public about the diversity of interests trying to protect desert Provide visitors with positive experience Communicate focus on tourism Expand recreation opportunities in west Mojave State lands commission has scattered parcels to exchange Economic partnerships for projects Joint ventures program for funding and cooperation Desert manager group forum Communication between agencies and planning groups Opportunities for partnering because many group have common interest Existing good management by private owners Department of Defense (DOD) is authorized to use funds for land stewardship outside the actual boundaries of the military facility Data clearinghouse for information exchange 5 year moratorium amendment after memo completion It is positive when stakeholders take on the role of stewardship Continue the National Park Service Advisory Group beyond 2004 to advise on desert planning issues Wild and scenic rivers opportunity
funding, as well as on education and engagement of the public and of recreation users.
The following are the lists of the opportunities and challenges identified by the participants at the Colorado - Mojave Desert Workshop.
These are not intended to be exhaustive lists of possible opportunities and constraints; rather, these lists document the ideas that were foremost in participants' minds at the start of the workshop.
Bold print denotes those items that seemed especially unique to the Desert Bioregion.
ISSUES AND CHALLENGES Population growth and border impacts from Nevada and Mexico Long-term water use Water resource extraction to urban areas Coordination of efforts and sharing resource Resource users from the outside area need to learn stewardship ethic Better law enforcement Information sharing (planners, agencies, academics) Concern for impacts to cultural and historical resources Funding to carry out commitments (including cost of labor to do plans) Staging and access for recreation Concern over loss of local control over land use; need to bring cities into decisions Concern over the very high ratio of public to private land in the region Recreation and reduced habitat vs. special status State Parks Dispute resolution processes needed Climate change Liabilities for abandoned mines

PERSPECTIVES In thinking about these questions, participants were asked to consider the following resource themes: Â· Â·
The task of the first small group session was to discuss regional perspectives.
Participants were divided into five small groups by subregion: North and East Mojave, West Mojave, Coachella Valley, Northeast Colorado, and West Colorado.
The group discussions were guided by the following three questions: 1.
What additional natural resource, working landscape and recreational planning efforts are needed in the region? 2.
How can the state provide additional support to ongoing conservation efforts and the provision of recreational opportunities in the region? E.g. partnering, supporting studies, assisting with data development, etc. 3.
What are the greatest needs or next steps for implementing exiting plans or priorities?

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES FROM COACHELLA VALLEY
A. Needs for additional natural resource, working landscape and recreational planning efforts: 1.
Notification for property owners if their land may be affected by the Habitat Conservation Plan 2.
Maintenance and monitoring plans and funding for purchased lands 3.
Regionwide 1601/ US Army Corp of Engineers 404 permit for streambed restoration - Streamline this permit process, especially in coordination with Habitat conservation Plan B. Support to ongoing conservation efforts and the provision of recreational opportunities that could be provided by the State (State support in funding partnerships, data development, etc.): 1.
Data on impact of non-motorized trails and effect on peninsular Bighorn Sheep 2.
Legacy [Resources Agency] should help with further inter-agency cooperation 3.
Legacy [Resources Agency] should support agencies (politically or with data) when they make tough decisions favorable to protection habitat/ species, rather than favorable to people 4.
Provide guidance in Natural Communities Conservation Plan process from the beginning (a manual available at the very beginning)2 5.
Additional training should be provided to California Fish and Game personnel for planning processes; There should be an accelerated Department of Fish and Game response time where decisions are needed.
6.
Agencies should streamline their decision-making processes and make them more transparent, so that private landowners can be more involved 7.
Streamlining of State processes for decision making and permitting for private lands 8.
More data sharing is needed between all parties as well as stakeholders 9.
State should supply an ombudsman to facilitate actions desired by local or private landowners 10.
Assistance in allowing landowners to preserve habitat in the long-term 11.
Provide for partnerships between private and public owners on stewarding common resources.
Establish standards (that are supported by sound science) that define healthy ecosystems and healthy resources to help private landowners maintain resources 12.
Plans should address any conflicts between resource protection and fire hazard mitigation for private property 13.
Establish standards for actions that are known to improve habitat 14.
Some private landowner representatives thought government landowners should be required to maintain current lands to healthy standards before acquiring more habitat 15.
The State needs better science on the impacts of grazing (looking at both benefits and potential impacts) in the desert 16.
The State needs to support monitoring to be aware of the conditions of all ecosystems C. Greatest needs and next steps 1.
Be willing to utilize science Science) 2.

for implementing existing plans and priorities: that is balanced and unbiased (like National Academy of information and ensure that the baseline is scientifically data not guesses
The California Department of Fish and Game is currently creating a guidance manual for Natural Community Conservation Plans (NCCPs).
Presently, three chapters of the forthcoming manual are complete and available online.
These are "Roles and Responsibilities of Consultants in Developing NCCP/HCPs," "Improving Public Outreach and Education for Natural Community Conservation Planning," and "Guidance for the NCCP Science Advisory Process," available at www.ca.dfg.gov/nccp.
(Additional guidance documents on this website pertain to the former NCCP Act and are not intended to serve as guidance for the current NCCP Act, but are provided for information only.)
In addition to these documents, guidance as to what should go into a plan can be found within the NCCP Act itself.

For efforts to establish Statewide GIS data standards, incentives are needed to get and share the data 4.
For all Plans, the maintenance plans need to be coordinated with adjacent landowners 5.
Assuring funding for maintenance Other Issues and Concerns Legacy should be aware that public input (such as from this workshop) often reflects widely divergent viewpoints, and should be cautious about using any individual's comments as support or justification for action.
Government needs to be accountable; government needs to share liability when they hold up action.
There should be an incentive to act now, such as an automatic issuance of permit after X number of days, or some other penalty Government needs to become actively aware of the perception that private landowners are much more restricted than government Government needs to become actively aware of and to address the double standard regarding what government and private landowners can do in protected areas Government should maintain resources if habitat restoration unduly restricts landowners Rethink government acquisition of lands in this region where so much land is already publicly owned ____________________________________________________________________________ 3.
REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES FROM NORTHEAST COLORADO DESERT
A. Needs for additional natural resource, working landscape and recreational planning efforts: 1.
Consider Department of Defense lands in State and Federal plans - Chocolate Mountains, Yuma 2.
Lower Northeast Colorado plans are not well integrated with other resources and plans.
Need one larger regional plan.
Show how plans interface.
- Park unit plans, Coachella Valley, Lower Colorado River Plan, North East Colorado, Metropolitan Water District - Imperial Irrigation District, Salton Sea and lower Colorado River - Enacting one plan may negatively affect others 3.
No group like Desert Managers Group for lower Colorado - Desert Managers Group is addressing some lower Colorado issues.
- Others can join Desert Managers Group.
- Desert Managers Group not focused on all topics; for example, Salton Sea not addressed.
They could add representation from Riverside, Imperial County, etc. to Desert Managers Group, Resource Conservation District, and Resource Conservation and Development District - Desert Managers Group Charter limited to public land managers - There should be subgroups focused on topics, rather than on areas; could have public land manager bring up more issues - Aquatic biodiversity is not adequately addressed in the North East Colorado, Salton Sea, or Colorado River Plans.

The Plans (North East Colorado and Salton Sea) needs to mesh with Colorado River Plan to address corridors etc. that cross plan lines.
- There are discrepancies and conflicts between plans.
Resource Conservation and Development Districts should continue actively coordinating the New River Plan in part through agriculture plans in Imperial Valley.
Sewer issue from Mexicali county is being partially addressed, but needs more funding to expand planning to address river water quality.
County needs support from state and federal government for wetlands/ water quality project.
Government agencies need to address water transfer effects on air quality, wetlands for water quality, and other issues.
Government agencies should be more active in protecting grazing lands.
Government agencies should consider local economies and the impacts that come with regulation and conservation investment.
-
B. Support to ongoing conservation efforts and the provision of recreational opportunities that could be provided by the State 1.
Keeping Department of Defense lands/ activities viable 2.
Department of Parks and Recreation director can designate areas in parks as gem and mineral collection areas - Additional recreation opportunities - Rockhounds donate time, etc. - Also brings money to local communities - For example: Collecting Termaline in Anza-Borrego is not allowed, but Department of Parks and Recreation could establish limits to the amount that is collected.
3.
Wilderness designation is an issue - allows lower management costs.
4.
State could partner more with Resource Conservation and Development Districts - Low state representation - Could help coordinate efforts - Knowledge, funding - Help bring projects together 4.
Create border coalition: address issues on both sides of U.S. Mexico border.
Resource Conservation and Development Districts got together on the U.S. side of the border; if the State would get involved, there could be more partnership opportunities to pull in more funding in from the federal government, etc. 5.
There should be State representation on Resource Conservation and Development District council, to have an ear and recognize opportunities.
Could be one of several agencies such Technology, Trade and Commerce Agency 6.
Help address truck traffic, water sewer issues, power plants in Mexico.
Federal government is not mitigating; the State needs to be more active in making the Federal government more aware of the issues and encourage the federal government to address them.
7.
Provide funding C. Greatest needs and next steps for implementing existing plans and priorities: 1.
Senate Bill 1468: counties and local government to consider Department of Defense lands in planning.
Federally funded Resources Agency should ask their departments to run planning by Department of Defense, too.

Department of Defense land's missions are not for conservation.
Want to roll back some restrictions in cases where Department of Defense's mission conflicts with Endangered Species Act.
3.
Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan can be used to substitute for to critical habitat.
(This is a Department of Defense/ Department of Interior issue,) - Need guidance for when to trigger state involvement with Department of Defense - It is not practical to use one simple rule (like 20 mi. zone); need to make info about military flights and officials impact zones (like noise) more available to other planners 4. Use farming buffers as opposed to housing next to military bases 5.
Consider impacts of flight paths/ routes etc.; especially low level training routes; look at noise studies 6.
More research is needed from Interstate 10 north to Interstate 40 and in Riverside County.
Department of Fish and Game needs more resources.
- Fairy duster and other plant species, Bighorn sheep - Better information on Desert Tortoise and the Andrew's dune scarab beetle; there is some misinformation out there; make sure data based on good science 7.
There should be a centralized way to make data available to all parties 8.
Natural Diversity Data Base should be more accessible to the public and needs to be updated 9.
In the Northeast Colorado plan everything gets mitigation, but at the expense of recreation.
Smaller Off-highway vehicle areas lead to higher impacts.
10.
Need to identify new Off highway-vehicle park areas 11.
Look at middle ground of recreation.
Family cars and bicycles are Off Highway Vehicles as well and when restrictions are placed on Off Highway Vehicle use, they are being restricted as well.
In the debate between environmentalists and dune buggie/dirt bike users, the interests of the bicyclist and passive recreationist gets left out.
6.
Grazing has benefits (aesthetic) that should be considered, especially in Coachella 7.
Redefine some wilderness areas so they can be opened up to some other uses 8.
Sometimes staff and agencies have information that they are discouraged from sharing.
9.
Implement Off-highway vehicle studies that show the need for more OHV areas 10.
Funding to manage State school bond lands and other lands, illegal dumping, county pick-up management costs, etc. 11.
Keep working lands working; non-profits could get more involved.
12.
Resource Conservation and Development Districts could partner with Non-governmental organizations for keeping working lands in private bonds.

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES FROM WEST COLORADO
A. Needs for additional natural resource, working landscape and recreational planning efforts: 1.
Plans for aquifers and watersheds - (e.g. Borrego Springs are overdraft Â­ 35 years of water left in ancient aquifer) 2.

STRATEGIES
The second small group session challenged participants to think about specific strategies address the concerns of local communities for continued economic development as well as needs for resource conservation in the region (Win-Win strategies).
Strategies are approaches to conserving natural resources that combine multiple tools and techniques and best utilize scare funds and resources.
Participants were divided into five small groups by subregion: North and East Mojave, West Mojave, Coachella Valley, Northeast Colorado, and West Colorado.
Certain strategies were common to all or most groups.
Â·
As compared to most regions across the State, where bringing land into protection was a frequently discussed strategy, in the Desert region, with so much land already in public ownership, land management was a more important focus.
All five groups talked about land management and stewardship practices as being fundamental to conservation of natural resources in the Desert region.
Included among these practices were: - Mitigation in cases where industry/ natural resource extraction takes place - Riparian fencing/ grazing management - Control of invasive plants - Promotion of native plants and landscape practices appropriate to the desert - Design of development that meets conservation goals Four of the five subregions discussed tourism as a Win-Win strategy.
Participants noted that tourism can not only contribute to economic development as a result of tourists coming into the region and spending money, but can also provide a workforce for volunteer land maintenance and management activities.
Three of the five groups also mentioned the value of recreation groups in-general (who may be either local or tourists from outside of the region).
These groups, such as hunters, mineral collectors ("rockhounds"), and Off-highway vehicle users, are a good source of volunteer labor for restoration projects and clean-ups.
Adoption of particular resources by local groups or establishment of "Friends" groups were noted as effective means to organize these stewardship activities.
Â·
Â·
The following workshop notes reflect the opinions of individual participants, focused on the subregion addressed by each group.
They do not represent the results of a group consensus process, nor even necessarily the perspective of the majority of participants.
The Legacy Project has not yet evaluated any of these ideas for their effectiveness or merit.

WIN-WIN STRATEGIES FOR COACHELLA VALLEY
1.
Exchange of information for people and sensitive species and development to co-exist 2.
Be willing to do on the ground experiments to figure out compatible uses - Agencies or anyone considering changes on the ground 3. Use historical conditions as a measuring tool - Get this information from residents and those with local knowledge 5.
Current and historical uses need to be considered for potential benefits 6.
Invite representatives of the stakeholder community (developer) to design a development that meets conservation goals.
7.
Consideration of local economic impacts when making decisions (i.e. forest closures affecting business in adjacent towns) and the time that local communities need to prepare for changes and new restrictions on use and development 8.
When agricultural lands are "preserved" compensation should be at least equivalent to highest value of the land 9.
Federal and state lands could be considered for transfer into private ownership, this would: increase available grazing lands, reduce management burden on government, increase tax base, and stewardship could be improved.
For Coachella Valley, local economic development is: I. II.

IV.
V. Urban development Agriculture Tourism Maintenance of traditional uses Compensation for restrictions on the use of land
Other Issues and Concerns Â· -
Once plans are developed, they should give clear designation of what is or is not allowed to reduce uncertainty Agriculture is not typically included in the plans, so there is no certainty about what is going to be allowed or regulated; it would be good to have more certainty.

WIN-WIN STRATEGIES FOR NORTHEAST COLORADO
1.
Industry can contribute to resource conservation - Cement industry and gold mines (Mitsubishi operates gold mines) readily contribute money for habitat enhancement and other project.
- Mitsubishi maintains wetlands conservancy (and other plans) on land they own.
2.
Private groups can ask big companies for funding and cooperate with government agencies.
3.
Off Highway Vehicles Associations often provide volunteers for restoration and maintenance of springs, etc.
Sometimes Off Highway Vehicle industries donate vehicles to be used by enforcement agencies.
5.
Tourism can contribute to maintenance/ management.
Recreation groups, sport groups or clubs from urban areas like to spend time in desert and volunteer there with private groups.
6.
"Friends" Groups can create interpretive materials to enhance recreation - Friends of Mojave Road: records history along the road, also put together a map of trails.
7.
Desert Museum: Agencies need to work with volunteers as a knowledgeable resource.
8.
Purchase of development rights on agricultural land - It is hard to show pressure out in the desert, but if the State made it a priority, it could happen in more cases.
- When water rights for farming are sold, habitat is lost.
Metropolitan Water District does not consider habitat, and they outbid the State for water rights.
7.
Citrus groves also provide wildlife habitat.
8.
Create larger staging areas for growing equestrian groups.
They volunteer time with Forest Service.
9.
Rockhounding: provides volunteers for local clean ups, in exchange for access by Bureau of Land Management.
Water sources are also put in.
10.
Translocate sheep between isolated populations.
Enhance Department of Defense Chocolate Lands for sheep habitat.
Create a Memorandum of Understanding to have the bombing range serve as a corridor; could be a State Department of Fish and Game, Department of Defense, and volunteers partnership.
11.
Hunter Conservation groups do promote wildlife habitat, and that pulls in more hunters.
They raise funding and do work projects.
- Desert Wildlife Unlimited is local volunteer group: build guzzelers; restore natural rock tenahas for safe entry and exit; restore springs/seep wells; build artificial water sources or restore others; brought in hunters Â­ good for local economy, builds a sense of ownership in public land.
12.
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is an example where State Parks coordinated well with National Park Service.
PROCEEDINGS OF DESERT REGION SPOTLIGHT ON CONSERVATION WORKSHOP

WIN-WIN STRATEGIES FOR NORTHEAST COLORADO CONTINUED 13.
Mojave Desert Resource Conservation District and Bureau of Land Management partnership for Salt Cedar eradication makes canyon more available for recreation use and good for wildlife.
Sheep hunting tag funds should go back into sheep programs.
This is being done in Imperial County for the deer population.
Plant fallow land for habitat for game: attracts hunters and photographers; reduces dust, improves air quality.
14.
15.
Other Issues and Concerns Â·
Should get over the presumption that economic development of resources is bad.
There are lots of minerals in desert.
The mining industry provided professional union scale jobstourism does not provide the same quality of jobs.
State Mines and Geology need to help develop and maintain mining industry.
Metropolitan Water District and State should discuss the effects of their water purchases and work out partnerships, require mitigation, and ensure that purchases are planned and coordinated rather than haphazard.
Existing Government plans need to be funded and implemented, to see if they work.
Trust needs to be built between local interests and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's).
Some members of the group felt that Federal Endangered Species Act should be reformed to reduce litigation and improve cooperation between stakeholders.

Users pay for stewardship on private and public lands - e.g. Cosumnes River - farmers, hunters, canoers - e.g. locally, Sand Dunes fee demo 6. Use of Private Land for desired uses like Off highway vehicle recreation - Public pays to mitigate for resource impacts on public lands.
- Public funds that are used to accommodate special recreational uses (like OHV use) should be available to mitigate for any damage, liability or other costs incurred by adjacent private land owners.
7.
Mitigation for development (Resource extraction or urban) that goes beyond the requirement.
- e.g. gas pipeline and historic road (State Historic Preservation Office - designated) restores/ improved 8.
Film entertainment user fees on public lands for conservation, mitigation, and/ or revenue; local economic benefits.
- Question: Is the public entity indemnified? 9.
Conservation easements/ Banks - Potential Limitations: loss of local tax revenue - Can we change Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) to acreage not population? 10.
Responsible management of concessions on public lands - e.g. Anza-Borrego tourists, dune buggy rentals 11.
Grants (unused) for interpretation, trail work, education, etc. - Public and private 12.
Retire/close grazing permit allotments - State help fund 13.
Lifelong education: learning to protect ecosystems not just individual resources.

Information Exchange tell us what data might be incorrect and what additional information was needed to help them do their jobs better.
At the Data Catalogs station, participants were asked, "Are there key restoration and monitoring projects not on the data base?" California Environmental Resources Evaluation System (CERES) staff fielded questions about the data walk and provided a way for participants to add "data about regional data" to the online CERES data catalogue.
The Urban Growth Model displayed projections of population growth distribution and potential urban/ suburban development in the region.
This station garnered great interest because participants visually witnessed possible future urban growth scenarios and how they change with different assumptions or constraints on growth.
Many participants stopped to visit the Demo Decision Support Tools Station staffed by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) employees.
They demonstrated basic and advanced concepts in GIS applications and green mapping.
Questions at the station ranged from very technical to more basic ones, such as: What data is available and how is it collected? ESRI staffers noted that the participants were sophisticated and wellinformed about GIS technologies.
Participants also contributed information about Existing and Emerging Conservation Plans, as well as about places that they considered to be Regional and Statewide Conservation Priorities.
Their input is recorded on the maps that follow.
An equally important component of the Spotlight on Conservation workshop was the Information Exchange.
This is where the Legacy Project displayed existing datasets on regional and statewide maps and gathered information on existing regional conservation plans and priorities from the participants.
Participants had several opportunities over the day and a half workshop to view the mapped information, interact with staff, and, most importantly, to provide Legacy with valuable data, feedback, and ideas on conservation.
STATION RESULTS In The Data Walk portion of the Information Exchange, regional and statewide maps displayed existing datasets of natural resources, working landscapes, and urban growth projections (such as land cover, impaired waterways, etc).

REGIONAL CONSERVATION PRIORITIES At the regional conservation priorities station, participants were asked to place dots on a state map to identify the top three places and/ or resources needing additional conservation attention in the region.
The locations identified by participants as regional conservation priorities are shown on the map below.
It is important to note that these dots do not represent the priorities of the participant group as a whole; rather, it is a collection of individual's ideas.
This information can be used to consider new places for investment as well as to identify interested groups for a particular location.
Of the 80 locations identified, the Salton Sea was given the greatest amount of attention, receiving a total of five dots.
The Sea's importances to shorebirds and as a pacific flyway stop were highlighted, with restoration, wetland preservation, and water conservation noted as needed actions.
Many of the other chosen areas centered on habitat linkages, riparian areas, endangered species habitat, and areas threatened by development.
Recommendations for needed actions included invasive species control, water management, and crossjurisdictional and inter-agency collaboration.
Additional notable sites that were assigned at least 3 dots included the Amargosa River, wildlife corridors adjacent to Joshua Tree National Park, and dune habitats in Imperial County.

STATEWIDE CONSERVATION PRIORITIES At the statewide conservation priorities station, participants were asked to place dots on a state map to identify the top three places and resources needing additional conservation attention in the state.
The locations are shown on the map below.
It is important to note that these dots do not represent the priorities of the participant group as a whole; rather, it is a collection of individual's ideas.
The dot numbers are keyed to the subsequent table, which gives information about each site, such as location, reason for conservation needs, and the source of information.
Of the 35 locations identified, the South Coast, from Los Angeles to San Diego, was given the most attention, receiving 13 dots.
In this region, clusters centered around the San Gabriel Mountains, the Santa Clara River headwaters, and locations near the city of San Diego, including San Dieguito River Park.
The Amargosa River in Death Valley was also highlighted, receiving three dots.
On a statewide basis, habitat linkages; threatened, endangered and sensitive species' protection; management of water resources; and agricultural concerns were repeatedly cited as important concerns.
The areas identified by participants as statewide conservation priorities are shown below.

FINAL REPORT The Legacy Project will place an interim report from each workshop on the Legacy Project website, once it has been reviewed by participants for accuracy.
The project will also further examine the existing and emerging plans, suggested conservation priorities and strategies, and the proposed places for priority investment in the region.
The Legacy Project will produce a final report summarizing results from all nine workshops late in 2003.
The report will be available on the website or by mail for review by all interested parties, and will be . the basis for future dialogue with regional citizens.
A final wrap-up session will be held in July 16, 2003 in Sacramento.
Information and analyses from these workshops will be shared with Resources Agency departments, boards and conservancies to assist them in their conservation investment decision-making.
Workshop results will also be applied in developing better data and planning-support tools and information for stakeholders across the state.

APPENDIX A WORKSHOP LOGISTICS The invitation process Â·
The Legacy Project and its consultants identified a wide range of stakeholders from throughout the region to provide as much balance in geographic distribution as possible for the Colorado - Mojave workshop.
The compilation of the invitation list and acceptance of registrations over the Legacy website was accomplished with the help of many people.
The practical logistics of the effort are summarized as follows: Â·
As the RSVP responses were received, pre-workshop packets were subsequently mailed out.
The packets contained detailed information on the locations, agenda, the discussion group process, and a detailed description of the Information Exchange.
Â·
Workshop participation Â·
The workshop regions were developed based on the California Biodiversity Council Bioregions of the State.
Approximately 90 Advisory Committee members from public agencies, businesses, non-profit organizations, and the private sector were brought together to suggest potential candidates for the Colorado - Mojave workshop.
The list was carefully reviewed and balanced for categorical inclusion and regional representation.
We included a wide variety of stakeholders from public agencies to private landowners, from environmental groups to agricultural interests.
Further, we continually reviewed the geographic representation, working by counties, and increased the outreach to underrepresented areas.
Over 200 invitation letters were mailed.
RSVPs were received either by phone, postcard or e-mail.
The respondent lists were reviewed for balance in category and geographic representation, and the follow up outreach focused on underrepresented groups.
There were 87 participants over the course of the day and a half workshop.

APPENDIX B DESERT PLANNING EFFORTS The following are summaries of the issues, planning criteria, and management goals included in the planning documents for several large-scale Desert Region planning efforts: Anza Borrego Desert State Park Preliminary General Plan, California State Parks (www.parks.ca.gov) The Plan identifies the following Key Issues and corresponding Goals and Guidelines: Physical Resources Geology: protect and preserve unique geological resources and features; protect sensitive soils Hydrology: protect surface and groundwater and strive to restore sustainable and ecologically functional regional watersheds Paleontology: protect and restore paleontological resources in perpetuity for scientific and educational values Significant and Sensitive Biota Protect native biota; preserve and encourage recovery of sensitive species Reduce presence and further invasion of exotic species Cultural Resources Identify, document and evaluate cultural resources Identify, protect, and interpret places holding cultural or religious significance to Native Americans and other ethnic communities Interpretation Provide opportunities to increase visitors' knowledge and appreciation of significant natural and cultural resources of the Park Recreation Maintain qualities of solitude and wildness; make management decisions to promote health of desert ecosystems Provide variety of recreational experiences while ensuring protection of resources
Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program Habitat Conservation Plan, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and States of Arizona, Nevada, and California (http://www.lcrmscp.org) The overall goal of the Plan is to develop and implement a Multi-Species Conservation Program that will: -
Conserve habitat and work toward the recovery of threatened and endangered species, as well as reduce the likelihood of additional species listings under the Endangered Species Act and California Endangered Species Act Accommodate present waster diversion and power production and optimize opportunities for future water and power development, to the extent consistent with the law, and Provide the basis for take authorization pursuant to the Endangered Species Act and California Endangered Species Act.
-
-
PROCEEDINGS OF DESERT REGION SPOTLIGHT ON CONSERVATION WORKSHOP

The Multi-Species Conservation Program includes the following conservation measures: - -
Maintenance of a portion of existing important covered species habitat in the Multi-Species Conservation Program planning area Creation or restoration of habitat to increase the extent of habitat in the Multi-Species Conservation Program planning area Long-term management of created and restored habitat to maintain and preserve ecological functions Avoidance and minimization of impacts resulting from covered activities and Multi-Species Conservation Program implementation of covered species and their habitats Population enhancement measures that directly of indirectly increase abundance of covered species Monitoring and research necessary to assess and improve conservation measure effectiveness
- -
- -
Conservation site-selection criteria will include: - - - - - - -
Presence of and proximity to existing occupied covered species habitats Suitability of site conditions for restoring habitat for specific species (e.g. appropriate soils, availability of water) Available requisite infrastructure (e.g. access roads, irrigation-related infrastructure) Relative suitability for achieving multiple restoration objectives through an integrated mosaic of habitat types Cost of land acquisition (e.g. Fee tiles, conservation easement, lease) Timing of availability relative to the need for implementing restoration measures Relative cost of implementing and maintaining habitat created/ restored habitat
Conservation Area Design Concepts: 1.
Habitat will be created/ restored in patches within the optimal range of patch sizes required to support sustainable occupancy of the target-covered species.
2.
MSCP conservation areas will be designated to create an integrated mosaic of vegetation to approximate the historical juxtaposition of communities along the LCR. Exs: approximating the historical floodplain community or Restoring habitat in locations where habitat mosaics are created or enhanced 3.
Created/ restored habitat for species with limited distribution along the LCR and with limited ability to move among habitat patches along the LCR will be located near known populations to facilitate future occupancy of restored habitats 4.
To create large patches of habitat that will be more likely to support high numbers of associated covered habitats, priority will be given to restoring habitat near existing habitat 5.
To the extent consistent with the conservation area site selection criteria, preference will be accorded to locating created/ restored habitat on federal, state, 
If suitable public lands are not available, public lands will be considered on the principle of willing sellor or lessor.
6.
Management of conservation areas includes a commitment to: - Reducing the risk of the loss of created/ restored habitat to wildfire by providing resources to suppress wildfires fires (e.g., contributing to and integrating with local, state, and federal agency fire management plans), - Designing conservation areas to contain wildfire and facilitate rapid response to suppress fires (e.g. fire management will be an element of each conservation area management plan - Implementing land management and habitat restoration measures in conservation areas to support the reestablishment of native vegetation that is lost to wildfire 7.
Conservation areas will, as needed, incorporate buffer areas to minimize the potential effects of wildlfire, existing land uses, and other activities that may be associated with adjacent lands that could adversely affect the ecological functions associated with the created/ restored habitats.
Conservation areas will be designed to minimize the need for buffers by locating, juxtaposing, and managing created/ restored habitats in a manner that will minimize the effect of activities that may occur on adjacent lands.
8.
Conservation areas will be located and designed to incorporate, to the greatest extent practicable, existing infrastructure and to minimize the need for construction of new infrastructure required for the establishment and management of habitats.

Draft Environmental Impact Report and Statement for the West Mojave Plan, A Habitat Conservation Plan and California Desert Conservation Area Plan Amendment, U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (http://www.ca.blm.gov/cdd/landuseplanning.html) The Plan identifies the following Planning Issues and corresponding intentions: Desert Tortoise and Mojave Ground Squirrel: - Identify conservation areas and adopt conservation strategies that minimize take on private land and recover populations on public land.
Other Listed and Sensitive Species: - Adopt conservation strategies that minimize take on private land, recover populations on public land, and prevent future listings of unlisted species.
Streamline Endangered Species Act Compliance - Develop a process that would allow applicants for city, county, state and federal permits and authorization to accelerate existing costly and time-consuming permit issuance procedures.
Motorized Vehicle Access Network for Public Lands - Provide appropriate access to public lands for commercial, recreational and other purposes in a manner that is compatible with species conservation.
Expansion of Fort Irwin - Develop conservation strategies that will be effective even if expanded military training programs are implemented on lands transferred in 2001 to Fort Irwin.
Standards and Guidelines for Public Lands - Develop rangeland standards for managing ecosystem health and guidelines for managing domestic livestock uses.
Regional Economic Growth - Promote economic growth within the planning area.
The Plan documents seven alternative strategies to conserve over 100 sensitive plants and animals and their habitats found within western Mojave Desert, while streamlining procedures for complying with Federal and California Endangered Species Acts.
Management Prescriptions are described for each alternative, and each prescription is designated as being applicable to one or more of the following resources/ objectives: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Adaptive Management Birds Bats Desert Tortoise Education Habitat Conservation Area Livestock Grazing Monitoring Mammals Mojave Ground Squirrel Mojave River Motorized Vehicles Plants Reptiles Raptors
Biological goals have been developed for each species addressed by the West Mojave Plan in accordance with habitat conservation plan requirements established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
The Plan identifies the following measurable biological goals: - -
Protect sufficient habitat to ensure long-term Desert tortoise population viability.
Establish an upward or stationary trend in the Desert tortoise population of the West Mojave Recovery Unit for at least 25 years.
