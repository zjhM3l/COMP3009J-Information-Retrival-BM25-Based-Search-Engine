(JAY) NIXON Fight Internet fraud THE INTERNET has created thousands of new opportunities for consumers to gather information, make choices and do business.
But it also has opened up new problems for law enforcement and opportunities for criminals.
Many scam artists, who once used telephones and the mail to reach victims, now have turned to the Internet as a more effective and cheaper way to defraud more consumers.
With so many Web sites and e-mails offering products and services, Missourians may find it more difficult to distinguish legitimate offers from fraudulent ones.
I hope this booklet helps you spot and avoid Internet scams.

But while shopping on the Internet may offer bargains and conveniences not found in a store, there are dangers.
To protect yourself while shopping: q Use a secure browser.
This software scrambles the purchase information you send over the Internet, ensuring a secure transaction.
Most computers have a browser installed, or you can download one for free from the Internet. q Safeguard personal information.
Many companies post privacy policies on their Web sites.
Check the policy before giving information.
q Shop with known companies.
Anyone can set up shop on the Internet.
Ask unfamiliar companies to send a catalog or brochure.
Also, check refund and return policies before placing an order.
q Keep your password private.
Also, avoid using a phone number, birth date or part of your Social Security number for a password.
Use a combination of numbers, letters and symbols.

5 Auctions Think before you link ONLINE AUCTIONS have become popular -- with consumers and with con artists.
While most transactions are legitimate, 87 percent of Internet fraud reported in 1999 involved auctions.
Like traditional auctions, the high bidder wins.
But that's where the similarity ends -- online auction houses don't hold the merchandise.
The high bidder deals directly with the seller.
The seller usually e-mails the high bidder to arrange for payment and delivery.
Some sellers, however, take the money without delivering.
The safest way to pay is by credit card because bidders can dispute the charges if the bid item is flawed or not delivered.
Many transactions that require payment by check or money order are fraudulent.
Internet fraud: 6 Before you bid: q Verify the seller 's identity.
Some sellers may use a forged e-mail header, making it impossible to contact them. q Ask about follow-up service.
Sellers may not have the expertise or facilities to provide service for problem goods.
q Ask about return policies.
Returning merchandise to an online seller may be difficult or impossible.
Also, find out who pays for shipping.
q Ask to pay by credit card.
If you don't receive the merchandise, or it is not what you expected, you can challenge the charges.
q Ask about using an escrow agent or paying c.o.d. if an online seller does not take credit cards.
Escrow agents take payment from the buyer and give it to the seller after verifying the bid item is satisfactory.
There usually is a fee. q Avoid impulse bids and purchases.
Make sure you are getting the best price.
MasterCard Ã¯Â¿Â½ SM USE A CREDIT CARD You can challenge a char ge if an item is not what you expected or is not delivered.
7 Think before you link Business opportunities
FRAUDULENT business opportunities may be promoted on Web sites and e-mailed solicitations.
These offers make it sound easy to start a business and earn big bucks with little work.
Offers may promise top earnings through Internet-related ventures such as training to become an Internet consultant, or by doing electronic billing for doctors.
Many notorious work-at-home scams such as envelope stuffing, assembling crafts at home, coupon clipping and reading books have been revived on the Internet
Here are some phrases signaling scams: q Make a fortune working a few hours a week.
q No experience needed.
q For a fee, get a list of businesses wanting home-based workers.
q Call a 900-number for more information.
q Make a decision now.
Internet fraud: 8 Guaranteed loans, credit E-MAIL MESSAGES may offer home-equity loans that don't require equity, or guaranteed, unsecured credit cards regardless of your credit history.
Offshore banks may be touted as the lenders.
Don't be fooled.
The home-equity loans are useless lists of lenders who will deny loans if you don't meet qualifications.
The promised credit cards never materialize.
Companies that advertise credit-repair services are selling worthless services.
They also may be encouraging you to violate federal law by lying on a loan or credit application, misrepresenting your Social Security number or getting an Employer Identification Number from the Internal Revenue Service under false pretenses.
Only time, effort and debt repayment can improve your credit.

Some Web sites may ask you to submit financial information to prove you are an "accredited investor."
Internet fraud: 10 Identity theft IDENTITY THEFT occurs when someone uses, without your knowledge, your name and personal information such as Social Security, credit-card and bankaccount numbers to commit fraud or theft.
