SOllE NEW POSSIBILITIES TO CONTROL KUDZU.
J. L. Michael, Southern Forest Experiment Station, Forest Service--lJSDA, Auburn IJniversity, Alabama 36849.
Six chemicals were tested at random with 3 replications at 3 rates for foliar activity on kudzu [Pueraria lobata (Willd.1 Ohwi].
All chemicals gave sone degree of control.
TRY-6376, Xm9-3972 (Lontrel), and Oust(nf) !+:eed Killer (formerly known as DPX-5648) gave more than 99% topkill for 3 l/2 months.
Preliminary results of greenhouse tests on l-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings indicate Lontrel, Oust, and DPX-6376 are safe for fzacation at rates effective on kudzu.
INTSOnUCTION
Kudzu, a perennial leguminous vine, was introduced into the United States from Japan in 1876.
Since the 1930's when kudzu was widely promoted by the Soil Conservation Service for gully control and temporary pastures, the vine has escaped into hedge-rows and penetrated deeply into forests.
Its rapid growth (10 m/year) and its habit of forming dense mats of vegetation enable it to smother pine trees 25 m tall.
Kudzu can make forest regeneration almost impossible.
The forest manager's techniques for site preparation are limited to grubbing--manually or mechanically--and to chemical control.
Because kudzu reproduces by spread of stolons and rhizomes, effective grubbing must remove the entire root system.
Since kudzu's tap root can reach 2 m in length, the grubbing method causes maximum site perturbation and is very expensive.

chemical methods developed over the past 10 years have generally centered on the use of picloram either as a spray, pellet, or impregnated wooden needle which is inserted directly into the root crown.
When the first two forms are used, the site is usually either burned or disked during the winter prior to treatment.
Applications of sprays and pellets can he made throughout a growing season.
Velpar, Roundup, Krenite, 2,4,5-T, 2,4-DP, 2,4-D, dicamba, and a mixture of TFP and dalapon have also been used as chemical controls.
Most of these control measures either cannot be applied to forested lands or are lethal to pines.
This paper reports the test results for 6 chemicals used to control kudzu in the field and the effects of 4 of these 6 chemicals on loblolly pine seedlings in the greenhouse.
flATERIALS AND METHODS Kudzu Study.
Research plots 14.6 x 26.8 meters were established in Tallapoosa County near Dadeville, Alabama, in an old field with 100% kudzu cclver .
Six chemicals were applied at three rates with three replications in a completely randomized design with three check plots during the period l-9 July 1981 (Table 1).
All chemicals were applied in an aqueous carrier (46 l/ha).
Surfactant WK at 0.5% was added to the carrier for EL-187, Oust and DPX-6376.
Control plots were also treated with water + surfactant.
All applications werefroma 4.9m tractor-mounted boom powered by CO2.
The degree of controi for each treatment was estimated as % reduction in cover.
Estimates were conducted 31 July, 23 September, and 22 October 1981.
The 22 October data were subjected to analysis of variance and ?uncan's Multiple Range Test at the .05 level.
Greenhouse Study.
One-year-old loblolly pine and water oak (Quercus nigra L.) seedlings were treated with EL-187, Lontrel, DPX-6376, and Oust to determine foliar and soil activity.
In this exploratory survey each rate was applied to three seedlings by foliar spray and by pipet to the soil.
Foliar and soil applications were at .28, .56, 1.12, 2.24 and 4.48 kg ailha for DPX-6376; .56, 1.12, 2.24, and 4.45 kg ai/ha for Oust; .56, 1.12, and 2.24 kg ai/ha for Lontrel; and 1.12, 2.24 and 4.48 kg ai/ha for EL-167.
Tests involved a total of 90 seedlings in each species.
Foliar and soil treatments were applied in the greenhouse on 8 and 9 September 1981 respectively and evaluated 6 weeks later.
Signs of activity, including necrosis, defoliation, and death, were noted for the soil treated seedlings and for the foliarly treated seedlings.
RESULTS A?TD ')ISCIJSSION Results of the field test on kudzu are given in Table 2.
the greenhouse tests on seedlings, it appears chemical control feasible for infested pine stands.
In tandem with of kudzu is 238 In the greenhouse screening soil activity phase, EL-187 caused needle burn on pine and defoliation of water oaks at all rates tested.
Oust, Lontrel, and gPX-6376 had no effect on pine seedlings but DPX-6376, at .564.48 kg ai/ha, showed some soil activity on water oak resulting in leaf necrosis at lower rates and mortality at the highest rate.
In the greenhouse screening foliar activity phase, pine treated with EL-187 at 2.24 kg ai/ha were chlorotic with dead terminal huds and considerable needle burn 6 weeks following treatment.
One of three seedlings foliar treated with DPX-6376 at 2.24 and 4.48 kg ai/ha had dead terminal buds and all seedlings treated at these rates had burned needles.
All seedlings treated with Oust at 1.12-4.48 kg ai/ha and with Lontrel at .56-2.24 kg ai/ha had very slight nfedle hurn hut no terminal bud damage.
These test results, although tentative, indicate at least three new herbicides have potential for controlling kudzu in pine forests without adverse effects on lohlolly pine.
DPX-6376 gave 100% control of kudzu at 1.12 kg ai/ha for 1 growing season and appears safe on loblolly pine at higher rates.
In many of the treated plots, johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense CL.) Persoon), sicklepod (Cassia obtusifolia L.), and other weeds appeared during the period of kudzu control, hut these weeds did not appear in the 1.12 kg plots of QPX-6376.
The .56 kg ai/ha plots of DPX-6376 also showed very good results with 100% control on 2 of the 3 replicates.
More testing is needed at rates of .56 - 1.12 kg ai/ha to determine the optimum rate and time of application for kudzu control with this compound.
Oust and Lontrel are also effective on kudzu at rates which appear safe Since neither gave 100% control both should be further tested for on pine. repeated annual application at rates around 1.12 kg ailha.
Southern pines show some tolerance to hexazinone (Velpar) hut not at the rates which, in this study, effect a high degree of kudzu control.
The Velpar (Liquid) plots treated with 13.44 and 6.72 kg ai/ha gave 98 and 95% control respectively.
While it is generally accepted that 100% control of kudzu is necessary, hexazinone is soil active and some residue from these rates may effect additional and improved control next year.
Garlon 4E gave 99% At these respectively.

Recause EL-187 is soil active and residual 4.48 kg ailha. remain in the ground, additional control may develop in the coming 239 All of the herbicides tested in this study controlled kudzu to some degree.
No attempt was made to determine root kill, therefore, whether any of the treatments will result in long-term control is unknown.
But it appears that all of these herbicides should undergo more intensive study in rate and timing aspects to determine maximum potential for kudzu control.
