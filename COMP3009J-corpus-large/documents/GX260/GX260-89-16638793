THE RED IMPORTED FIRE ANT, SOlenopsis invicta Buren, introduced into the United States in the 1930s, has become a serious pest of man in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern United States (Lofgren et al. 1975, Adams 1986, Lofgren 1986).
This ant continues to spread and may establish populations in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
The increasing incidence of the polygyne (multiple queen) form poses an additional problem, not only to humans and agricultural crops but also to wildlife, especially surface-active animals (Porter 
Baits have been used to control the fire ant since mirex was discovered in the early 1960s
(Lofgren et al. 1963, 1964b).
However, serious concerns regarding residues in the environment led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ban use of mirex in 1978 (Johnson 1976).
New baits developed in the early to mid-1980s were based on a formulation similar to that of mirex bait; i.e., a chemical dissolved in once-refined soybean oil and applied to a corn grit carrier
(Williams et al. 1980, Lofgren 
Because they degrade rapidly and leave no known residues, the new toxicants are less hazardous to the environment.
However, other problems are the (1) attractiveness of the formulations to nontarget insects that also feed on the bait and are affected by the toxicants (Williams 1986), (2) flowability and dispersal of the baits, (3) poor shelf life of the formulations because of rancidity of the soybean oil, and (4) high cost.
Development of formulations that eliminate or reduce bait effects on nontarget ants should be a high priority, considering the role that the native ant community plays (Whitcomb et al. 1973, Nickerson et al. 1975, Buren et al. 1978, Lammers 1987).
Although this study was not conducted to address this issue, a reduction or the removal of the soybean oil in toxic baits may lessen the effect these baits have on some of the nontarget ant species.
Also, baits without soybean oil should solve some of the other problems mentioned above such as flowability, rancidity, and cost.
Removal of the soybean oil, of course, must not be at the expense of reducing bait effectiveness.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of a bait formulation containing fenoxycarb (Maag Agrochemicals, Inc., Vero Beach, Fla, but no soybean oil against the red imported fire ant..
Materials and Methods Laboratory procedures for evaluating bait toxicants have been described fully (Williams et al. 1980, Williams 1983, Banks et al. 1988).
Because fenoxycarb causes little mortality in worker ants (Banks et al. 1988), this study was designed to determine overall effects of the baits on whole colonies.
The formulations were tested against monogyne queenright laboratory colonies (12-18 mo old) containing 35,000-45,000 workers and 10-20 ml of brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae).
The colonies were reared as described by Banks et al. (1981), except the diet consisted of honey/water (1:1), hardboiled chicken eggs, and house fly pupae.
Colonies were held without food for 5 d before the test.
Baits for both laboratory and field tests were prepared in the same manner.
Baits without soybean oil (NOSBO) were formulated by immersing June 1991 WILLIAMS ET AL.: FENOXYCARB FIRE ANT BAITS WITHOUT SOYBEAN OIL 815 Table 1.

The total of the ratings for all colonies on a plot yields the "population index" (PI) for that plot.
The difference between the before- and aftertreatment population indices was used to calculate the percentage control for each treatment.
Quantitative Analysis for Fenoxyearb.
A 2-g sample of fenoxycarb-NOSBO and SBO baits was collected immediately before application.
Three days after the treatments were applied, samples of about 1,000 worker ants were collected from individual mounds in the treatment plots by pushing a 20-ml scintillation vial, its inner wall coated with talc, into the mound so that its top rim was slightly below the soil.
After a sample of worker ants had fallen into the vial, it was capped and taken to the laboratory.
The samples (baits and individual worker ants) were weighed and extracted three times in acetonitrile.
The combined extracts of each sample type were filtered via syringe through a 13mm, 5-,u Zefluor filter in a Swinny stainless steel apparatus.
The filter was washed with an additional volume of fresh acetonihI'r.
"16ample was evaporated to dryness and reconsti pled wit a suitable volume of acetonitrile (500 Altr``Iples containing 1-10 ng analyte/mg sample).
This was again filtered.
Ten ,ul of the filtrate was injected onto a Varian MCH-10 reverse-phase HPLC column and eluted with a solution of MeOH/H20/AcOH (65: 35:0.3).
The eluant was directed through a Perkin Elmer LC-75 variable-wavelength UV/VIS detector set at 228 am.
The column flow rate was 1.5 ml/min.
Data were analyzed with a Varian Vista 401 data processor.
Standard calibration curves were prepared from an analytical sample of fenoxycarb (Maag).
Samples were quantified by comparison with the standard curve.
Samples were replicated (n = 2), and the means and standard deviations were recorded.
The arcsine transformation was performed on all percentage data so the resulting data would have a nearly normal distribution.
General linear models (GLM) (SAS Institute 1988) and orthogonal comparisons were performed.

However, analysis of individual worker ants collected from plots treated with the fenoxycarb-NOSBO baits revealed that they contained 
This difference could reflect a much greater availability of fenoxycarb to the worker ants when high levels of SBO are added to the grits, because the workets~'~''' liquids and not on the solid grit particle.
This factor rttay have been reflected in the laboratory datar*a slower death rate of the queens in colonies treated with the fenoxycarb-NOSBO bait.
The difference also illustrates the effectiveness of extremely low levels of fenoxycarb, which undoubtedly accounts for the comparable reductions in the population indices of the field populations.
Glancey et al. (1989) demonstrated excellent activity of fenoxycarb against laboratory colonies at dosages as low as 0.125 mg per colony.
In field tests, Banks et al. (1988) showed that, although the range of amounts of fenoxycarb applied was quite large (6.20-25.05 g (AI)/ha), the mean reductions in population indices (68.8-99.1) were not significantly different.
Another possible benefit of the NOSBO formulation may be an increase in shelf life of the bait.
Rancidity of soybean oil in baits is a problem because it reduces feeding on the bait (Lofgren et al. 1964a).
Thus, its removal from a formulated bait would eliminate this factor and should increase June 1991 WILLIAMS ET AL.: FENOXYCARB FIRE ANT BAITS WITHOUT SOYBEAN OIL HIT shelf life.
We do not have any evidence at present that there would be a problem with rancidity of the very small amount of residual oil remaining in the pregel defatted corn grit during its manufacture.
Elimination of the SBO produces one definite benefit in a reduction in the cost.
This cost reduction could be passed on to the users of the bait.
In conclusion, our data show that the NOSBO formulation for fenoxycarb was as effective as the SBO formulation against both laboratory colonies and field populations.
However, our method of formulation resulted in a larger amount of active ingredient being applied with the NOSBO formulation.
There is evidence that the amount of active ingredient in the fenoxycarb-NOSBO or the bulk rate of application can be reduced to a much lower level without affecting the efficacy.
The removal of soybean oil from the bait formulation would improve the flowability, reduce cost, and should increase shelf life.
This study indicates that further studies are warranted with fenoxycarb-NOSBO formulations and with other chemicals in formulations without soybean oil.
Also, more important, the effect of baits without soybean oil on nontarget insects, especially other ant species, needs to be determined.
