CCRCs differ from nursing facilities because they offer a range of services and housing options on one campus.
These communities usually provide independent living, assisted living, and nursing home services, while some facilities offer single or dual services (such as assisted living and/or independent living).
Residents benefit from the flexibility CCRCs offer by providing multiple levels of housing that allows them to move from one setting to another within the complex based on their health care needs.
A barrier to CCRC services is that financing resident placement can be very expensive.
Currently, refundable or nonrefundable entry fees for CCRCs in Maryland range from $60,000 to over $400,000 with monthly fees ranging from $700 to $2,500 or more.
CCRCs have been growing in popularity as an increasing number of people search for alternatives to the traditional nursing home.
The number of CCRCs grew 50% in the 1980s and continued to grow in the 1990s.
As of February 2001, there were 32 CCRCs operating in 12 of Maryland's 24 jurisdictions.
CCRC contract options are generally classified as Type A, B, or C with each classification based on the services offered by the CCRC and the payment methods.
*
Type A communities use an agreement that is considered an extensive contract that covers long term care without any substantial increase in residents' monthly payments.
Type B communities use a modified contract that covers a specified amount of long term care during a set period of time without a substantial increase in residents' monthly payments.
Type C communities use a fee-for-service contract, which covers only basic services that generally are not related to health care.
These communities are the least expensive initially, but subsequently require additional add-on charges based on your needs.
Most of the new CCRCs being developed are Type C communities.
Existing CCRCs are attracting new residents by offering a combination of multiple contracts with different pricing arrangements, thus providing additional options.
Trends show fewer individuals subscribing to the original CCRC contract (Type A) and instead use Type C, the fee-for-service contract.
In Maryland, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ), the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) and the Department of Aging regulate CCRCs.
The Office of Health Care Quality issues licenses for the nursing home component of those facilities with comprehensive care beds.
The MHCC regulates CCRC nursing home beds under its certificate-of-need program and under planning regulations.
The Department of Aging regulates a CCRC's marketing and contracts.
For a CCRC to obtain certification by the Department of Aging, a contract must meet the following requirements:
1) Subscribers must pay an entrance fee that is, at a minimum, three times the weighted average of the monthly service fees;
2) Subscribers must sign a contract for a period of more than one year, usually for life, that requires either a transfer of assets or payment of an entrance fee and monthly fees to live in a secure and protected environment; and
3) The community must provide, at a minimum, access to medical and nursing services or other health related benefits.
