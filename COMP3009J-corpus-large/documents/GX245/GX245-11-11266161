The Massachusetts State Racing Commission, hereinafter called the Commission, was created by an act of the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the year 1934.
M.G.L. c. 128A as inserted by St. 1934, c. 374 and amendments states that the Commission shall have full power to prescribe rules, regulations and conditions under which all horse races or horse racing meetings shall be conducted in the Commonwealth.
205 CMR 4.00, as herein prescribed apply to all persons or individuals, associations or corporations, which shall hold or conduct any running horse racing meeting within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts licensed by the Commission, where horse racing shall be permitted for any stake, purse or reward and the definitions here given are to be considered in connection with 205 CMR 4.00 and as a part of it.
All licensees and participants are charged with knowledge of 205 CMR 4.00.
No licensee or other persons shall engage in his or her occupation at any Massachusetts running horseracing track without first reading 205 CMR 4.00.
Should any question arise as to the meaning of any rule or regulation, the Commission or its representatives will be available to provide an explanation.
Every license to hold a meeting is granted upon the condition that the licensee shall accept, observe and enforce 205 CMR 4.00.
Furthermore; it shall be the duty of each and every officer, director and every official and employee of said licensee to observe and enforce 205 CMR 4.00.
Any and all of 205 CMR 4.00 may be amended, altered, repealed or supplemented by new and additional rules.
The Commission may make exceptions or waive any rule or rules in individual instances as in its judgment it may deem proper.
The Commission may rescind, modify of increase any penalty or decision on infraction of the rules imposed or made by the racing officials.
The laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and 205 CMR 4.00 supersede the conditions of a race, or the regulations of race meeting.
205 CMR 4.00 is supplemented by the State Administrative Procedure Law found in M.G.L. c. 30A.
M.G.L. c. 30A provides the procedures that must be followed by all state agencies on such matters as the amending process and the adjudicatory procedure.
Under this act any interested party has the right to attend all hearings conducted by the Commission for the purpose of the adoption or amendment of any rule or regulation.
The Commission shall afford any interested person an opportunity to present data, views or arguments in regard to any proposed rule change.
Upon written notice to the Commission, a person may request the adoption, amendment or repeal of any regulation with an opportunity to present data, views or arguments in support of such request.
If a dispute should arise concerning a ruling by a steward or other racing official, any party affected by such ruling has a right to an appeal to the Commission upon written notice to the Commission within ten days.
At such hearing each party shall be given an opportunity to be represented by an attorney, to call and examine witnesses, to introduce exhibits, to cross-examine witnesses who testify and to submit rebuttal evidence.
The Commission shall make available upon request an official record of the hearing and a party may request and receive a transcript of such record upon payment to the Commission of the cost of such transcript.
The Commission shall provide, in writing, its decision along with findings of fact and conclusions of law.
Any person who does not agree with a final decision of the Commission shall be entitled to judicial review of such decision by filing a petition for review in Superior Court within 30 days after receipt of notice of the final decision of the Commission.
The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and, in most instances, shall be confined to the record.
The rules on pari-mutuel wagering are located in an entirely separate rulebook entitled 205 CMR 6.00 Pari-mutuel Rules for Horse Racing, Harness Horse Racing and Greyhound Racing.
