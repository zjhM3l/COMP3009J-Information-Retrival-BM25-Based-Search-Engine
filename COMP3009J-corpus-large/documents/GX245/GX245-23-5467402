The red imported fire ant is a nuisance and its sting can cause medical problems.
Fire ants can interfere with outdoor activities and harm wildlife.
Ant mounds are unsightly and may reduce land values.
In heavily infested areas, eliminating fire ants is highly desirable.
However, eradication of this species is not currently feasible (see History and Control Efforts, p. 17).
A number of organisms kill newly-mated fire ant queens.
These include dragonflies, other ants, some types of birds, lizards, spiders and toads.
Animals that eat ants, such as armadillos, may disturb mounds and eat some workers, but they are not really useful in control
Pouring very hot or boiling water on a mound is a fairly effective treatment, particularly at times when ants are close to the mound surface, such as on a cool, sunny morning.
Use of battery acids, bleaches or ammonia products can be dangerous and is strongly discouraged, except when they are ingredients in a registered pesticide product accompanied by usage directions.
Conventional bait formulations combine pesticide ingredients with processed corn grit coated with soybean oil.
Granular insecticides are applied with fertilizer spreaders.

However, D.E. does not eliminate colonies within treated mounds.
When D.E. is used as a carrier in formulations of pyrethrins, it may enhance penetration of this botanical insecticide into insect bodies.
The user is always responsible for the effects of pesticide residues, as well as for problems that could arise from drift or movement of the pesticide to neighboring areas.
ALWAYS READ AND FOLLOW CAREFULLY THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE CONTAINER LABEL.
Pesticides must be registered and labeled for use by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Department of Agriculture.
The status of pesticide label clearances is subject to change and may have changed since this publication was printed.

Electrical Equipment and Utility Housings
Like many other ants, fire ants frequently infest electrical equipment.
They chew on insulation and can cause short circuits or interfere with switching mechanisms.
Air conditioners, traffic signal boxes, and other devices can be damaged.
Fire ants also nest in housings around electrical and utility units.
The ants move soil into these structures, which causes shorting and other mechanical problems.
Note: For safety reasons, an electrician or a licensed pest control operator should treat infested electrical equipment.
Specialized products and training are necessary to treat these sites safely and effectively.
Treatment program
1.
Turn off all electrical service before starting.
With an individual mound treatment method, eliminate colonies around electrical and plumbing casings and housings.
Injectable aerosol products containing pyrethrins, or similar products, give immediate control.
Hydramethylnon bait applied to individual fire ant mounds will provide control in about 1 week, even if the colony is located within the structure.
Do not use liquid drenches, sprays, or products that may damage insulation around electrical fixtures.
Treatment of a larger area around the electrical structure is optional.
Mound and area treatments are described in the section on Home Lawns and Other Ornamental Turf Areas.
Be extremely careful when applying pesticide around water systems and well heads to prevent contamination of wells and ground water.
Once ants are eliminated, remove debris and soil to reduce the possibility of short circuits.
2.
Treat the inside of equipment housings with products labelled for such use, such as State Fire Ant Killer with resmethrin, Rainbow Insect Control containing chlorpyrifos, Stutton^Ã¯Â¿Â½ JS 685 Powder containing synergized pyrethrins and silica gel, Ascend^Ã¯Â¿Â½ or Elastrel insecticide with dichlorvos.
Maintenance options
After ants are removed from the electrical equipment, prevent reinfestation and damage.
* Where possible, seal all sensitive electrical components, particularly those that are not insulated.
Examples are plastic housings containing contact points of switches, relays and circuit breakers.
* Spray long-residual contact insecticides around housings, making sure to avoid the electrical equipment.
* Apply specifically labeled products to the housing itself (see Step 2 in the treatment program above).
Home Gardens
Ants occasionally feed on vegetable plants in home gardens.
They tunnel into potatoes underground and feed on okra buds and developing pods.
The worst damage usually occurs during hot, dry weather.
Ants may also be a nuisance to gardeners during weeding and harvesting.
Treatment options
*
Granular products containing carbaryl plus metaldehyde are registered for ants foraging in the garden.
Products containing diazinon or chlorpyrifos are registered for soil insects in home gardens; they can be applied before planting and may provide some temporary control of foraging fire ants.
Follow all preharvest intervals indicated on the label when using a pesticide on and around food plants.
*
Ant mounds can be shoveled out of the garden or treated with very hot water, taking care not to disturb or treat the garden plants.
Only a few products containing pyrethrins or rotenone are registered for treating fire ant mounds in vegetable gardens.
* Since most baits are not registered for use inside gardens, apply baits around the garden perimeter.
Foraging ants from colonies both inside and outside the garden will collect the bait and take it to their colonies.
*
To prevent ants from entering a garden, apply diazinon or chlorpyrifos spray or granules around the perimeter of the garden as a barrier, and treat individual mounds near the garden as needed.
Fire ants invade compost piles and mulched flower beds seeking warmth and moisture.
They also nest under cracked pavement, removing dirt from underneath sidewalks and roadways and aggravating structural problems.
Colonies in these sites may be difficult to locate precisely.
When the exact location of a fire ant colony is unknown, treat the area of greatest ant activity with a fast-acting bait product such as hydramethylnon
.
Around Bodies of Water
Fire ants require water to survive and are often found near creeks, run-off ditches, streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and other bodies of water.
If surface water is unavailable they tunnel down to the water table many feet below the ground.
Every effort must be made to avoid contaminating water with pesticides.
Fire ant bait products contain very small amounts of active ingredients and can be applied close to shorelines, but not directly to the water.
To lessen the risk of runoff into waterways, apply baits when ants are actively foraging.
Individual mound treatments near water should be made with care, using products such as acephate (Orthene^Ã¯Â¿Â½) that have low toxicity to fish.
Pyrethrins and rotenone products should be avoided because of their high toxicity to fish.
Do not apply surface, bait or individual mound treatments if rains are likely to occur soon after treatment.
Organizing an Area-Wide Fire Ant Suppression Program
Fire ant management programs have been widely adopted and are successful in many situations.
However, because they are usually implemented by individual landowners and managers, re-infestation from nearby untreated areas generally occurs.
Most baits on the market today (e.g., Amdro^Ã¯Â¿Â½, Award^Ã¯Â¿Â½, Logic^Ã¯Â¿Â½, Ascend^Ã¯Â¿Â½ and others) came from earlier efforts to develop products suitable for area-wide treatment programs, and are best suited for large-scale use.
Despite great public concern, neither the state nor federal government is currently planning or funding any large-scale fire ant treatment programs.
It is up to local organizations to decide on the best IPM strategy for a particular situation.
With the help of experts in the field, any group can organize an effective fire ant suppression program with or without the help of a governmental agency.
The "Two-Step Method" (Program 1) for Home Lawns and Other Ornamental Turf Areas is the method best suited for area-wide treatment.
Homeowners and land managers may still need to treat a few mounds ("step two") between large-scale bait treatments, but far fewer than if no bait had been applied.
Matching the Program to Your Resources and Needs
There are many ways people can work together to conduct area-wide fire ant suppression programs.
Coordinating neighborhood treatment.
Homeowners can coordinate treatment of their entire neighborhood each year, usually once in the fall and once in the spring.
Each homeowner should receive instructions on: 1) appropriate fire ant bait products to purchase; 2) how to properly broadcast a bait; and 3) treatment date(s).
Each homeowner is expected to make his own applications or arrange for treatment on the designated treatment date(s).
Contingency dates should be scheduled in case rain is forecast or the temperature is less than 65 or greater than 95 degrees F on the primary treatment date.
Working through homeowner associations.
Home-owner associations might contract with a local commercial applicator to broadcast fire ant bait over the entire subdivision periodically, including common areas, medians and other community property in the area.
They should be asked to evaluate the area and apply minor touch-up treatments as needed.
Working through city and county government.
With enough citizen support, local governments can establish fire ant control programs that both treat public areas and perhaps allow homeowners to have their properties treated for an additional fee.
The municipal or county government could contract with a commercial pest control applicator.
Advertising should encourage entire blocks or neighborhoods to sign up, because the larger the area treated, the longer lasting the control.
Treatments would include annual broadcast applications of a fire ant bait, follow-up checks and possibly individual mound treatments as needed.
The fee paid by individual landowners could pay for the program.
It might be possible for a city government to coordinate the aerial application of a fire ant bait to an entire town.
Smaller areas where baits can't be applied, such as swimming pools and vegetable gardens, would have to be covered during application.
Widespread citizen support would be essential.
The aerial applicators contracted by the city would have to agree to modify equipment to apply the recommended amount of bait per acre, heed the FFA flying height over populated areas, and avoid bodies of water and agricultural areas where food is produced.
Many volunteers would be needed to successfully coordinate and implement this program.
Planning to Ensure Success
Determine treatment areas.
Some localized areas, even within heavily-infested regions, have little or no fire ant infestation.
Surveys should be conducted to determine if the number of red imported fire ant mounds is high enough to justify treatment.
Respect individual differences.
Sensitivity to fire ants and to the use of insecticides varies dramatically from person to person.
Some individuals might not want to participate in a control program because they believe fire ants are not a problem and serve useful purposes, or because they are opposed to using insecticides, natural or otherwise, on their property.
At the other extreme are individuals who want no fire ants on their property and don't care about the methods used to achieve that goal.
Participation in an area-wide program should be voluntary or decided upon through a democratic process.
Promote education and recognize limitations.
The strengths and limitations of the program should be acknowledged.
For instance, a broadcast bait will eliminate most (usually 90 to 95 percent) of the fire ant mounds in an area temporarily (6 to 18 months).
It will not eradicate them permanently.
The speed at which suppression will occur is rather slow.
Periodic, coordinated reapplication will be necessary to maintain control.
Between broadcast treatments, some individual colonies may occur that require individual mound treatment.
Landowners whose property borders untreated areas such as agricultural lands, water edges, flood plains and wilderness will likely have continuous migration of ant colonies onto their properties.
Follow pesticide laws and regulations.
The Structural Pest Control (SPC) Board regulates the commercial use of insecticides in urban environments.
SPC laws mandate that anyone applying insecticides for a fee be licensed by the Board and insured.
Although you can apply insecticides on your own property, you can not treat other yards in the neighborhood without a license.
Read and retain the insecticide product label.
Those who use insecticides must keep the label with the product.
Never purchase a large quantity of insecticide and re-package, divide, or store it in a container without the label.
Always follow the directions on the product's label.
Take bids and review credentials.
Before contracting with a commercial applicator company or private pest control operator, get several bids based on the specific services you require.
These firms must be licensed by the SPC Board.
Fire Ant Treatment Methods
Treatment methods and products vary greatly in effectiveness, speed of activity, practicality (labor requirements), toxicity to the user and the environment, and cost.
Carefully study available treatment methods and their proper use in order to choose the best one for a particular situation.
Many methods and products have been evaluated by research and Extension faculty.
This information is available from county Extension agents and Extension entomologists.
Per mound treatment costs range from about $0.15 to more than $1.00 per mound, and bait treatments can cost $8.00 per acre or more.
Natural and biological control.
A number of organisms kill newly-mated fire ant queens.
These include dragonflies, other ants, some types of birds, lizards, spiders and toads.
Animals that eat ants, such as armadillos, may disturb mounds and eat some workers, but they are not really useful in control
Some parasites and pathogens are known to attack ants, and several have been marketed for fire ant control.
The predatory straw-itch mite, Pyemotes tritici (Lagreze-Fossat 
Parasitic nematodes (Steinernema spp.) are roundworms that seek out and enter insects, paralyzing them and developing in their bodies.
Species and strains vary in their effectiveness.
Strains tested to date caused ants in treated mounds to temporarily move away from the treated mound, but few colonies were actually eliminated.
Parasitic fungi (Beuvaria bassiana) are also being evaluated as individual mound treatments.
The most effective biological control organisms for large-scale programs will likely be those that spread from mound to mound.
Several are being evaluated for control, including flies, Strepsiptera and parasitic wasps.
It is hoped that introducing natural enemies of fire ants to the U.S. may someday help to control them, although natural enemies will not eliminate fire ants.
In South America, where fire ants have many natural enemies, the ants are still present
Currently, the best biological control method for fire ants is to preserve native ant species that compete with them
(Fig. 2, p. 15).
One way to preserve native ants is the judicious use of insecticides.
Physical and mechanical methods.
Pouring very hot or boiling water on a mound is a fairly effective treatment, particularly at times when ants are close to the mound surface, such as on a cool, sunny morning.
Approximately 3 gallons of hot water poured on each mound will eliminate about 60 percent of the mounds treated.
Be careful handling large volumes of hot water to prevent serious burns, and keep hot water off of desired plants and grass.
Sometimes it may be sufficient to move colonies away from sensitive areas such as gardens.
Disturbing or knocking down mounds frequently will cause colonies to move.
Some people believe shoveling one mound on top of another will force ants to kill each other, but this is not true.
Certain barriers can keep ants out of sensitive areas such as wood duck boxes or greenhouse benches.
Talcum powder and Teflon-like tape or spray products can be used on vertical surfaces, but lose their effectiveness in humid or damp conditions.
Tanglefoot^Ã¯Â¿Â½, a petroleum-based sticky material available as a gel or aerosol, is effective temporarily until it becomes coated with dust and other debris.
Plates or wires heated to about 140 degrees F form a hot barrier that ants will not cross.
Control devices.
Various mechanical and electrical products have been marketed for fire ant control.
One device is designed to electrocute fire ant workers as they climb onto an electric grid inserted into the mound.
It will kill many worker ants, but the queens and brood are unaffected.
There are vibrating and sound-producing units designed to repel colonies, and devices that use microwaves or explosive elements to heat mounds or blow them up.
Such products are often marketed without scientific evaluation.
The fact that a "control" device is on the market does not indicate that it is effective.
These products may kill some ants, but rarely eliminate a colony.
Deceptive or fraudulent claims concerning fire ant control devices should be reported to the Texas Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission.
Home remedies.
In addition to very hot or boiling water, other "home remedies" have been tried.
While these methods sometimes appear to work, they rarely eliminate colonies.
Usually, the ant colony simply moves to a new location, or the queen and a few workers temporarily remain hidden underground.
Gasoline and other petroleum products do kill fire ant colonies.
However, petroleum products are dangerously flammable, kill grass and plants around the treated mounds, and can seriously pollute the soil and ground water.
Soap solutions, cleaning products or wood ashes soaked into the mound are believed to remove the protective oil coating from the ants.
Use of battery acids, bleaches or ammonia products can be dangerous and is strongly discouraged, except when they are ingredients in a registered pesticide product accompanied by usage directions.
Sprinkling instant grits onto fire ant mounds is ineffective.
In theory, the ants eat the grits, which then swell and rupture the ants' stomachs.
In fact, only the last stage of the developing fire ant is known to ingest solid food.
All other life stages feed only on liquids or greasy materials.
Some natural substances found in crushed or grated citrus peels are reported to be toxic to fire ants.
However, until proper formulations and application techniques for these naturally-occurring chemicals are developed, they are unlikely to be effective
.
"Organic" insecticides.
Several products said to be "organic" (of natural origin) are currently marketed for fire ant control (see Table 1, Botanicals section, p. 18).
All of these products are registered by the Environmental Protection Agency as pesticides and some are very effective.
They are not necessarily safer than other insecticides though, and should be used with care.
Chemical control.
Chemical insecticides (both "organic" and synthetic) continue to be the main method of battling fire ants.
Insecticides registered by the Environmental Protection Agency pose minimal risk when used as directed.
Insecticide applications can be aimed at the foraging ants and/or at the entire colony.
Table 1 lists fire ant insecticides by generic names of ingredients.
Carefully follow directions on the product label for the use of protective clothing, re-entry intervals, and watering practices before and after treatment.
Baits.
Conventional bait formulations combine pesticide ingredients with processed corn grit coated with soybean oil.
Soybean oil is a feeding stimulant that is important to the bait's success.
Baits can be applied as spot treatments to individual mounds or broadcast over larger areas.
To achieve satisfactory results:
* Use fresh bait, preferably from an unopened container or one which has been tightly resealed and stored for no more than 2 years.
Purchase only enough bait to make one treatment and do not store large quantities once the containers have been opened.
Bait is only collected by ants when it is fresh.
It is then carried back to the colony and shared with other members of the colony.
Rancid or stale bait smells bad and is ignored by foraging ants.
* Apply when worker ants are actively foraging.
This can be determined by leaving a small pile of bait in the area to be treated.
When ants are seen actively removing the bait 10 to 30 minutes later, you will know both that the bait is attractive and that ants are foraging.
Tuna fish, pet food or potato chips are also attractive to foraging ants.
Foraging activity slows when soil temperature is lower than 70 degrees F or higher than 95 degrees F.
In mid-summer, apply bait in late after- noon or early evening, since foraging ants are less active during the heat of the day.
* Apply when the ground and grass are dry and no rain is expected.
* Do not mix bait with other materials such as fertilizer or seed.
* Use appropriate application equipment and calibrate it properly.
Differences in the oiliness of bait brands and production batches can cause variations in applicator output.
Temperature and humidity also affect the rate at which bait flows through the applicator opening.
The speed at which the applicator is moving is an important factor, particularly with factory-calibrated settings.
Hand-operated spreaders such as the Cyclone^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Seed Sower, Ortho^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Whirlybird, and Republic or Scott's Hand-held Spreader are the least expensive applicators and are adequate for treating small areas.
The operator can walk or ride on the back of a vehicle.
Some push-type applicators, such as Spyker^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Models 24 and 44, also may be suitable, but some modification (attach fire ant plate) is required to keep from applying too much material.
Most rotary and drop-type fertilizer spreaders will not apply fire ant baits at the recommended rate.
Electric spreaders such as the Herd^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Model GT-77A, Cyclone^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Spreader Model M-3 or similar applicators are best for treating large areas.
These spreaders have vibrating opening plates that prevent clogging.
Swath width is either pre-set or adjustable with a rheostat.
Applicators can be mounted on any vehicle that will maintain a low speed.
Do not use ground-driven or power take off-driven equipment, since it can rarely be set to apply such a low rate.
Aerial application requires some modifications to the aircraft and application equipment.
A description of these relatively simple modifications and calibration methods can be obtained from bait product manufacturers.
In addition to their use as a broadcast treatment, baits can be used for individual mound treatment or spot treatment.
Compared to other mound treatment products, baits cause less hazard to the environment and less mound relocation.
Several bait products (hydramethylnon, sulfonamide) are available in stations to place where ants are foraging (indoors or outdoors).
Individual mound treatments.
In addition to baits, mound treatment insecticides are formulated as dusts, liquids, granules and aerosols.
Their effectiveness depends on proper application.
Contact insecticides must contact ants to work and should be applied during times of the year when ants are close to the mound surface.
It is also important not to disturb the mound during treatment.
Mound drenches: Although a few are ready-to-use, most fire ant mound drenches are formulated as liquid concentrates that must be diluted in the amount of water specified on the label.
Avoid skin contact with the concentrate.
Mix the proper amount in a gallon container, such as a sprinkling can, plainly marked "POISON."
Do not use the container for any other purpose.
Properly store or discard containers after use.
Pour the solution on top of and around the undisturbed mound.
Most mound drenches require several days to eliminate the colony, although those containing pyrethrins are effective almost immediately.
Granular products: To treat a single mound with a granular product, measure the recommended amount in a measuring cup and sprinkle it on top of and around the mound.
Do not disturb the mound.
If the label specifies to water in the insecticide, use a sprinkling can and water the mound gently to avoid disturbing the colony.
Several days may pass before the entire colony is eliminated.
Dusts:
Some products, such as those containing acephate (Orthene^Ã¯Â¿Â½), are specially labeled for dusting individual fire ant mounds.
Distribute the recommended amount of the powder evenly over the mound.
Treated colonies are usually eliminated in several days.
Injectable products:
Products containing pyrethrins, resmethrin, tetramethrin or chlorpyrifos are manufactured in special aerosol containers to which an injection rod is attached.
The rod is inserted into the mound in a number of places, according to instructions on the product label, and the pesticide is injected for a specified time into each mound.
Special equipment is required to apply PT^Ã¯Â¿Â½ 270 Dursban^Ã¯Â¿Â½ (chlorpyrifos) and Earthfire^Ã¯Â¿Â½ (resmethrin).
Surface applications and barriers in and around structures.
Products used to treat ant trails and colonies located in wall voids are usually dusts or sprays, although some are insecticide-latex paint mixtures.
Unless the colony itself is treated, these products only reduce the number of foraging worker ants.
Surface treatments are also used to create barriers to protect items or areas from foraging worker ants.
For a more detailed discussion of these methods refer to L-1783, "Carpenter Ants," and L-2061, "House Infesting Ants," available from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service.
Surface applications outdoors.
Granular insecticides are applied with fertilizer spreaders.
These
materials must be thoroughly watered into the soil after application.
Liquid formulations are applied with a high-volume hydraulic, hose-end or boom sprayer.
Contact insecticides are usually long-acting (2 to 3 months), suppress foraging ants quickly, and prevent small mounds from becoming established.
Through repeated use, these treatments can eliminate colonies.
Red imported fire ant colonies consist of the brood and several types (castes) of adults:
* winged males (distinguished from the females by their smaller heads and black bodies);
* red-brown winged females;
* one or more queens (wingless, mated females); and
* workers (see Fig. 2).
Worker ants are wingless, sterile females.
They protect the queen by defending the nest from intruders, by feeding the queen only food that the workers have eaten first, and by moving the queen from danger.
They also forage and care for the developing brood.
The brood is made up of cream-colored eggs, larvae and pupae of all the castes.
The winged forms, or reproductives, live in the mound until their mating flight, which usually occurs in the afternoon soon after a rainy period.
Mating flights are most common in spring and fall.
Males die soon after mating, while the fertilized queen alights to find a suitable nesting site, sheds her wings, and begins digging a chamber in which to start a new colony.
Sometimes, several queens can be found within a single nesting site.
A newly-mated queen lays about a dozen eggs.
When they hatch 7 to 10 days later, the larvae are fed by the queen.
Later on, a queen fed by worker ants can lay up to 800 eggs per day.
Larvae develop 6 to 10 days and then pupate.
Adults emerge in 9 to 15 days.
The average colony contains 100,000 to 500,000 workers and up to several hundred winged forms and queens.
Queen ants can live 7 years or more, while worker ants generally live about 5 weeks, although they can survive much longer.
There are two kinds of red imported fire ants--the single queen and multiple queen forms.
Workers in single queen colonies are territorial.
Workers from multiple queen colonies move freely from one mound to another, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of mounds per acre.
Areas infested with single queen colonies contain 40 to 150 mounds per acre (rarely more than 7 million ants per acre).
In areas with multiple queen colonies, there may be 200 or more mounds and 40 million ants per acre.
The red imported fire ant builds mounds in almost any type of soil, but prefers open, sunny areas such as pastures, parks, lawns, meadows and cultivated fields.
Mounds can reach 18 inches in height, depending on the type of soil.
Often mounds are located in rotting logs and around stumps and trees.
Colonies also can occur in or under buildings.
Colonies frequently migrate from one site to another.
The queen needs only half a dozen workers to start a new colony.
They can develop a new mound several hundred feet away from their previous location almost overnight.
Flooding causes colonies to leave their mounds and float until they can reach land to establish a new mound.
Colonies also can migrate to indoor locations.
Fire ants can be beneficial.
They feed primarily on insects and arthropod pests, which can reduce the need for insecticides in commercial agriculture.
In urban areas fire ants feed on flea larvae, chinch bugs, cockroach eggs, ticks and other pests.
Medical Problems
Fire ants are aggressive, will defensively attack anything that disturbs them, and can sting repeatedly.
Symptoms of a fire ant sting include burning, itching and a white pustule that forms in a day or two.
Although the stings are not usually life threatening, they are easily infected and may leave permanent scars.
Some people become sensitive to fire ant stings and should seek the advice of an allergist.
If a sting leads to chest pains, nausea, severe sweating, loss of breath, serious swelling or slurred speech, the person should be taken to an emergency medical facility immediately.
Some people may lapse into a coma from even one sting.
Relatively few deaths from fire ant stings have been documented, compared to deaths from bee and wasp stings.
Tips for avoiding medical emergencies and for treating ant stings:
* Teach children and visitors about fire ants and their hazard.
* Wear protective clothing during outdoor activities.
Wear shoes or boots and/or tuck pant legs into socks.
* Treat stings with an insect bite remedy containing benzocaine or other ingredients that deaden pain and protect against infection.
* Control fire ants in areas used most frequently by people and pets.
History and Control Efforts
More than 60 years ago, the red imported fire ant was accidentally brought into Mobile, Alabama from South America.
It now infests more than 260 million acres comprising most of nine southeastern states and Puerto Rico.
It reached Texas during the 1950s and spread steadily across the state.
Fire ants can travel long distances when newly-mated queens land on cars, trucks or trains.
Shipments of nursery stock or soil from an infested area may relocate entire colonies or nests.
The fire ant presently infests the eastern two-thirds of Texas and continues to spread westward
(Fig. 1, p. 8).
Efforts at county-wide fire ant eradication during the late 1960s and early 1970s, although they used effective pesticide baits, were not successful.
The last large-scale aerial treatments were applied to Madison, Kerr and Kendall counties in 1981 and 1983.
Why did eradication programs fail? The reasons are debatable, but it is now known that eradication is hindered by the ant's biology and by problems with treatment methods.
Biological obstacles to eradication.
The ants infest such an extensive area that a single treatment would take years and massive resources to apply.
Fire ants have a high reproductive rate and disperse easily.
Thousands of reproductive females are produced per colony, and the mated females begin a colony wherever they land.
The ants eliminate competing insects and then rapidly overwhelm an area.
Whole colonies can move, and in the multiple queen form, the colonies can split into many new colonies.
The queen is protected from many poison baits, since she is fed only food eaten first by workers.
If a poison works too rapidly, the worker is killed before the poison is passed to the queen.
Finally, worker ants from well-fed colonies may not forage on a bait product, or a bait may not be as attractive as some abundant natural food.
Pesticidal obstacles to eradication.
Pesticide treatments are expensive and time-consuming, and there are only three basic approaches.
The first is surface treatment using a residual contact poison.
This approach is the least environmentally sound because the treated surface remains toxic for a long time.
The ants may survive by foraging underground.
The second is individual mound treatment, which involves the application of a large volume of pesticide to reach the queen.
However, it is hard to manipulate large volumes of liquid, and treatment is more expensive and time-consuming.
Colonies not eliminated may move or split into several colonies.
The third method is bait treatment, which uses some sort of attractive substance the ants like to eat.
Unfortunately, baits are not always consumed, and the bait's attractiveness is short-lived.
The pesticide must be slow-acting and effective over a range of doses, since the dose the ants get cannot be controlled.
Baits may also kill ant species that compete with the fire ant and help control it.
Economic, regulatory and environmental obstacles to eradication.
The best way to treat large areas (hundreds of acres) is aerial application of bait.
However, not all areas can be treated because of label restrictions and application limitations.
Even with a bait product, it is not feasible to treat the entire infested area or even a large part of a single state, and untreated areas are sources for reinfestation.
The larger the treatment area the more slowly reinfestation occurs.
If periodic treatments are discontinued, the area may become just as infested as it originally was within a year or two.
Table 1.
Fire ant insecticides, modes of action and formulations, with generic names of active ingredients and some examples of product names.
Insect Growth Regulator (fenoxycarb)
This material mimics the effects of the insect's own juvenile hormone, reducing the production of viable eggs and preventing the development of worker ants for up to a year after application
.
It does not kill adult insects.
Treated ant colonies persist for several months after treatment, until worker ants present at the time of treatment die naturally.
Fenoxycarb is formulated as a bait to be applied to individual mounds or broadcast.
(Award, LogicÃ¯Â¿Â½)
Botanicals (pyrethrins, rotenone, pine oil, turpentine)
These plant-derived products are contact insecticides and have various modes of action.
Pyrethrins, which act on the nerve axon, kill ants quickly (within minutes to hours) and can be used as mound treatments or surface sprays.
Rotenone acts on the respiratory tissues, including nerves and muscles.
Pyrethrins and rotenone products break down rapidly in the environment.
Rotenone and pine oil (turpentine) products are relatively slow-acting (days to weeks) and are applied as mound drenches.
(Insecto^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Formula 7, Organic Plus^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fire Ant Killer, and others)
Derivatives of Pyrethrins (allethrin, resmethrin, sumithrin, tetramethrin)
Like pyrethrins, these products destabilize nerve cell membranes and kill quickly, but are quickly deactivated and have little residual activity.
They are contact insecticides applied as aerosol injections, mound drenches or surface sprays
.
(Enforcer^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fire Ant Killer)
Pyrethroids (bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, fluvalinate, lambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin, s-bioallethrin, s-fenvalerate, tefluthrin, tralomethrin) These products also destabilize nerve cell membranes.
They can persist in the environment longer than pyrethrins and their derivatives.
They are relatively quick-killing contact insecticides applied as mound drenches, dusts or surface sprays and granules
.
Avermectins (abamectin)
This bait product is derived from a soil fungus and inhibits nerve transmission.
As a mound treatment it kills worker ants and colonies quickly, but as a broadcast treatment it acts more like an insect growth regulator, preventing the production of viable eggs.
(Ascend) Carbamates (bendiocarb, carbaryl)
These materials disrupt nerve transmission (cholinesterase inhibitor).
They are relatively quick-killing contact insecticides used as mound drenches and surface sprays
.
(Sevin^Ã¯Â¿Â½, Turcam^Ã¯Â¿Â½)
Organophosphates (acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, fenthion, isofenphos, malathion, propetamphos, propoxur, trichlorfon) These products also interfere with nerve cell transmission (cholinesterase inhibitor).
They are relatively quick-killing contact insecticides formulated as aerosols, liquids, dusts or granules and applied as mound treatments or surface applications.
(Dursban^Ã¯Â¿Â½, Oftanol^Ã¯Â¿Â½, Orthene^Ã¯Â¿Â½ and others) Miscellaneous Compounds
Hydramethylnon (amidinohydrazone) and sulfonamide kill ants by preventing them from converting food into energy.
These baits eliminate fire ant colonies within a week when applied to individual mounds, but take several weeks when broadcast.
They are also formulated in bait stations.
(Amdro^Ã¯Â¿Â½, Combat^Ã¯Â¿Â½, MaxForce^Ã¯Â¿Â½, Raid^Ã¯Â¿Â½ Max)
Inorganic Compounds
Boric acid is a slow-acting stomach poison.
It is commonly formulated as a dust or liquid bait for control of ants.
Diatomaceous earth (D.E., silicone dioxide) products are usually applied as contact insecticides to ant trails indoors.
D.E. abrades the waxy layer from the insect exoskeleton, causing the insect to desiccate.
However, D.E. does not eliminate colonies within treated mounds.
When D.E. is used as a carrier in formulations of pyrethrins, it may enhance penetration of this botanical insecticide into insect bodies.
The user is always responsible for the effects of pesticide residues, as well as for problems that could arise from drift or movement of the pesticide to neighboring areas.
ALWAYS READ AND FOLLOW CAREFULLY THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE CONTAINER LABEL.
Pesticides must be registered and labeled for use by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Department of Agriculture.
The status of pesticide label clearances is subject to change and may have changed since this publication was printed.
