The agency retained national research firm Market Trends to send mystery shoppers in pursuit of services for business people and laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits and/or re-employment.
More than 350 mystery shops have been done since work began in June 2002.
Statewide cumulative results for all services show an above-average rating of 3.3 on a scale of one to five.
In addition to numerical ratings, mystery shoppers provide written comments on services.
These comments offer valuable insights.
"We know, for the most part, that staff provide good service to our customers, but we are finding out even more to help us enhance service and recognize staff who go the extra mile to meet customers' needs," said Barbara Burgener, Employment Security's Director of Quality and Organizational Performance.
Research findings are being analyzed and shared throughout the system.
The goal is to prompt positive change that customers can see, hear, and feel.
This research-driven approach is already working.
As a result of mystery shopping findings, the Unemployment Claims TeleCenters have changed procedures for call handling.
A customer service training course was established.
More than two-thirds of all Employment Security staff have completed the training.
Further quality enhancements are being crafted as research findings continue to surface.
