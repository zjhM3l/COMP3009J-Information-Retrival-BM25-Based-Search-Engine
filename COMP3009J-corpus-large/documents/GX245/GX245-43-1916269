General Information About Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Key Points for This Section * Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
* Exposure to radiation and family history may affect the risk of developing childhood ALL.
* Possible signs of childhood ALL include fever and bruising.
* Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood ALL.
* Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (also called acute lymphocytic leukemia or ALL) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.
This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.
It is the most common type of cancer in children.
Normally, the bone marrow produces stem cells (immature cells) that develop into mature blood cells.
There are 3 types of mature blood cells: * Red blood cells that carry oxygen to all tissues of the body.
* White blood cells that fight infection and disease.
* Platelets that help prevent bleeding by causing blood clots to form.
In ALL, too many stem cells develop into a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes.
These lymphocytes may also be called lymphoblasts or leukemic cells.
There are 3 types of lymphocytes: * B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.
* T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.
* Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.
In ALL, the lymphocytes are not able to fight infection very well.
Also, as the number of lymphocytes increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.
This may lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding.
This summary is about acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Refer to the following PDQ summaries for information on other types of leukemia: * Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment.
* Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment.
* Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment.
* Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment.
* Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment.
* Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment.
Exposure to radiation and family history may affect the risk of developing childhood ALL.
Possible risk factors for ALL include the following: * Having a brother or sister with leukemia.
* Being white or Hispanic.
* Living in the United States.
* Being exposed to x-rays before birth.
* Being exposed to radiation.
* Past treatment with chemotherapy or other drugs that weaken the immune system.
* Having certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.
Possible signs of childhood ALL include fever and bruising.
These and other symptoms may be caused by childhood ALL or by other conditions.
A doctor should be consulted if any of the following problems occur: * Fever.
* Easy bruising or bleeding.
* Petechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding).
* Bone or joint pain.
* Painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin.
* Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.
* Weakness or feeling tired.
* Loss of appetite.
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood ALL.
The following tests and procedures may be used: * Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.
A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
* Complete blood count: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: + The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
+ The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.
+ The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.
* Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration: The removal of a small piece of bone and bone marrow by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone.
A pathologist views the bone and bone marrow samples under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.
* Cytogenetic analysis: A test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are looked at under a microscope to find out if there are certain changes in the chromosomes in the lymphocytes.
For example, in ALL, part of one chromosome is moved to another chromosome.
This is called the Ã¯Â¿Â½Philadelphia chromosome.Ã¯Â¿Â½ * Immunophenotyping: A test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are looked at under a microscope to find out if malignant lymphocytes (cancer) began from the B lymphocytes or the T lymphocytes.
* Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body.
An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that produces it.
* Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on: * Age and white blood cell count at diagnosis.
* How quickly and how low the white blood cell count drops after initial treatment.
* Gender and race.
* Whether the leukemia cells began from the B lymphocytes or the T lymphocytes.
* Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes.
* Whether the leukemia has spread to the brain and spinal cord.

Stages of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Key Points for This Section * Once childhood ALL has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), testicles, or to other parts of the body.
* In childhood ALL, risk groups are used instead of stages.
Once childhood ALL has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), testicles, or to other parts of the body.
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages.
For childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), risk groups are used instead of stages.
The following tests and procedures may be used to determine the risk group: * Lumbar puncture: A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid from the spinal column.
This is done by placing a needle into the spinal column.
This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
* Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.
An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
* Testicular biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues from the testicles so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer.
This procedure is done only if there seems to be anything unusual about the testicles during the physical exam.
In childhood ALL, risk groups are used instead of stages.
Risk groups are described as: * Standard (low) risk: Includes children 1 to 9 years of age who have a white blood cell count of less than 50,000/Ã‚ÂµL at diagnosis.
* High risk: Includes children younger than 1 year of age or older than 9 years of age and children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000/Ã‚ÂµL or more at diagnosis.
It is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment.

Recurrent Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Recurrent childhood ALL is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated.
The leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow, brain, testicles, spinal cord, or in other parts of the body.

Treatment Option Overview
Key Points for This Section * There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
* Children with ALL should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating childhood leukemia.
* The treatment of childhood ALL usually has 3 phases.
* Two types of standard treatment are used:
* Chemotherapy
* Radiation therapy
Other types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
These include the following: * Chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation
There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Different types of treatment are available for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the "standard" treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Cancer.gov Web site.
Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
Children with ALL should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating childhood leukemia.
Your child's treatment will be managed by a pediatricÃ¯Â¿Â½ oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.
The pediatric oncologist may refer you to other pediatric doctors who have experience and expertise in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine.
These may include the following specialists: * Hematologist.
* Medical oncologist.
* Pediatric surgeon.
* Radiation oncologist.
* Endocrinologist.
* Neurologist.
* Neuropathologist.
* Neuroradiologist.
* Pediatric nurse specialist.
* Social worker.
* Rehabilitation specialist.
* Psychologist.
Regular follow-up exams are very important.
Side effects can result from treatment long after it ends.
The treatment of childhood ALL usually has 3 phases.
The treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases: * Induction therapy: This is the first phase of treatment.
Its purpose is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow.
This puts the leukemia into remission.
* Consolidation/intensification therapy: This is the second phase of therapy.
It begins once the leukemia is in remission.
The purpose of consolidation/intensification therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse.
* Maintenance therapy: This is the third phase of treatment.
Its purpose is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse.
Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used for induction and consolidation/intensification therapy.
Treatment called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy is usually given during each phase of therapy.
Because chemotherapy that is given by mouth or injected into a vein may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS (brain and spinal cord), the cells are able to find Ã¯Â¿Â½sanctuaryÃ¯Â¿Â½ (hide) in the CNS. Intrathecal chemotherapy and radiation therapy are able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS and are given to kill the leukemia cells and prevent the cancer from recurring (coming back).
CNS sanctuary therapy is also called CNS prophylaxis.
Two types of standard treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.
When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).
When chemotherapy is placed directly in the spinal column (intrathecal), a body cavity such as the abdomen, or an organ, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas.
Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.
When used to prevent cancer from spreading to the brain and spinal cord, it is called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis.
Intrathecal chemotherapy is given in addition to chemotherapy by mouth or vein.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells.
There are two types of radiation therapy.
External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.
Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.
External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.
When used this way, it is called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis.
Other types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
These include the following:
Chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation
Stem cell transplantation is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.
Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a donor and are frozen for storage.
After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.
These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
This summary section refers to specific treatments under study in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Cancer.gov Web site.

About PDQ
PDQ is a comprehensive cancer database available on Cancer.gov.
PDQ is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database.
Most of the information contained in PDQ is available online at Cancer.gov, the NCI's Web site.
PDQ is provided as a service of the NCI.
The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health, the federal government's focal point for biomedical research.
PDQ contains cancer information summaries.
The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine.
Most summaries are available in two versions.
The health professional versions provide detailed information written in technical language.
The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.
Both versions provide current and accurate cancer information.
The PDQ cancer information summaries are developed by cancer experts and reviewed regularly.
Editorial Boards made up of experts in oncology and related specialties are responsible for writing and maintaining the cancer information summaries.
The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made as new information becomes available.
The date on each summary ("Date Last Modified") indicates the time of the most recent change.
PDQ also contains information on clinical trials.
Before starting treatment, patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another.
Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory.
Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients.
During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about new treatments, the risks involved, and how well they do or do not work.
If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard."
Listings of clinical trials are included in PDQ and are available online at Cancer.gov.
Descriptions of the trials are available in health professional and patient versions.
Many cancer doctors who take part in clinical trials are also listed in PDQ.
For more information, call the Cancer Information Service 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237); TTY at 1-800-332-8615.
