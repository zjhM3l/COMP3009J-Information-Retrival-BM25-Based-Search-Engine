These housing communities have different levels of care based on your needs.
Where you live depends on the level of care you need.
In the same community, there may be individual homes or apartments for residents who still live on their own, an assisted living facility for people who need some help with daily care, and a nursing home for those who require higher levels of care.
Residents move from one level of care to another based on their needs but still stay in the continuing care retirement community (CCRC).
If you are considering a CCRC, be sure to check the record of its nursing home.
Your CCRC contract usually requires you to use the CCRC nursing home if you need this level of care.
Many of the questions that you might want to ask about these communities are the same as those to consider when choosing a nursing home.
CCRCs generally charge a large payment before you move in (called an entry fee) and then charge monthly fees.
To find out more about this housing option, look at the Administration on Aging website.
To find out if a CCRC is accredited and get advice on selecting this type of long-term care community, look at the Continuing Care Accreditation Commission website.
The American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA) website gives you free Consumer Tips on finding CCRCs.
