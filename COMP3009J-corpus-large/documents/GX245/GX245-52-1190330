Appendix III
Definitions of Restoration (Category 1) Indicators
Clean Water Requirements
303(d) List Section 303(d) of the federal Water Pollution Control Act requires states to develop a prioritized list of waterbodies that currently do not meet water quality standards, or will not meet water quality standards after all technology-based controls are in place.
The State of Maryland developed its list and it was approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency in December 1996.
It includes 130 waterbodies across the state.
The water bodies are impaired by one or more of the following pollutants: nutrients, sediments, toxic substances, acidity or fecal coliform bacteria.
This indicator is the number of occurrences on the 303(d) List for a watershed.
If a watershed is listed at least once on the 303(d) list , it receives a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Water Quality
Monitored Nutrient Concentrations: eutrophication This index is a mean of current status (1994-96) information, scored according to a 10-level scale (one - most degraded to 10 - best condition) for mixed layer total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids.
Values are consolidated into a single mean for each major tidal tributary.
Watersheds whose score value is in the lower 25 percent of scores for the 138 watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Monitored Nutrient Concentrations: habitat This index is the mean of current status (1994-1996) information, scored according to a 10-level scale (one - most degraded to 10 - best condition), for surface chlorophyll a, Secchi depth and summer (July - September) dissolved oxygen levels at the bottom.
Values are consolidated into a single mean for each major tidal tributary.
Watersheds whose score value is in the lower 25percent of scores for the 138 watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Modeled Nitrogen and Phosphorus Loading Rate Values reported are from the Chesapeake Bay Program's Phase IV Watershed Model and the MD Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) Integrated Watershed Analysis and Management System (IWAMS).
The value includes loadings for both point and nonpoint sources and is represented in pounds per watershed acre.
Watersheds whose loading rate is in the top 25 percent of the watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Aquatic Living Resources
SAV Abundance This is determined by measuring the extent of areas with SAV growth each year.
Using the 1996 aerial survey results, the area of current SAV was divided by the acreage corresponding to the Tier III restoration goal (restoring SAV to 2 meters depth).
This value was multiplied by 10 to yield a value between one and 10 (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).
Watersheds with a score of one receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
SAV Habitat Index This index is determined using 1994 to 1996 Chesapeake Bay Program Bay segments passing, failing and borderline to the habitat requirements for SAV.
The scores are adjusted to range between one and 10 (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).
Watersheds with a score less than 7 receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity This indicator is scored based on measures of species diversity, species composition, productivity, and trophic composition.
Scores are adjusted to range between one and 10 (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).
Watersheds with a score less than 6 receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity This indicator is scored based on total number of species, number of species comprising 90 percent of the catch, number of species in the bottom trawl, anadromous fish abundance, estuarine fish abundance, total fish abundance less menhaden, proportion of planktivores, proportion of carnivores, and proportion of benthivores.
Data are ranked within sites and a score is assigned based on the severity of the impact.
Scores are adjusted to range between 1 and 10 (1 most degraded, 10 best condition).
Watersheds whose score value is in the lower 25 percent of scores for the applicable watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Anadromous Fish Index This indicator is scored based on the number of ecologically valuable anadromous and semi-anadromous fish caught per haul.
Data are ranked within sites and a score is assigned based on the severity of the impact.
Scores are adjusted to range between 1 and 10 (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).Watersheds whose score value is in the lower 25 percent of scores for the applicable watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Non-Tidal Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity This indicator is developed using Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS), Targeted Watershed Project, and Rapid Bioassessment Program data.
Comparable sampling and scoring methods are used to develop an index from these programs.
Scores for watersheds are reported as means for the sites within each watershed (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).
Watersheds with a score less than 6, and whose number of samples taken was at least 4, receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity This indicator is developed from Maryland Biological Stream Survey and Targeted Watershed Project data.
Fish are collected using the same methods in both of these programs.
Scores for watersheds are reported as means for the sites within each watershed (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).
Watersheds with a score less than 6, and whose number of samples taken was at least 4, receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Non-Tidal Instream Habitat Index This indicator is based on seven measures of instream habitat quality that are scored for each site based on observations of habitat condition in streams during sample visits.
The seven habitat measures rate the quantity and quality of physical habitat available in the stream for fish and benthic macroinvertebrate colonization and rate the degree to which the stream channel has been altered due to alterations in watershed landscape.
A mean for these seven measures is calculated for each site, and the mean habitat score for watersheds on a one to 10 scale is reported (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).
Watersheds whose score value is in the lower 25 percent receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Landscape Indicators
Percent Impervious Surface This landscape indicator is defined as the percent imperviousness for a watershed normalized by land acres.
Watersheds whose percent imperviousness value is in the top 25 percent of the watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Population Density This landscape indicator is defined as the State Office of Planning's (MOP) year 2000 projected population for the county, reallocated by DNR to watershed scale and normalized by land acres.
Watersheds whose population density value is in the top 25 percent of the watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Historic Wetland Loss Density This landscape indicator is defined as the total acres of hydric soils for a watershed, extracted from MOP's county soils data.
Watersheds whose historic wetland loss value is in the top 25 percent of the watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Percent Unbuffered Streams This indicator is defined as the area of unbuffered streams in a watershed normalized by stream length.
Watersheds whose percent unbuffered streams value is in the top 25 percent of the watersheds receive a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Soil Erodibility This indicator is developed based on an area's slope, soil erodibility factor, distance to nearest stream and landuse type.
If a watershed scores in the high (score between 0.275 and 0.314) or very high (score between 0.314 and 0.37) classification, it receives a Category 1 rating for this indicator.
Definitions of Protection (Category 3 ) Indicators
Aquatic Living Resources
Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity This indicator is scored based on total number of species, number of species comprising 90 percent of the catch, number of species in the bottom trawl, anadromous fish abundance, estuarine fish abundance, total fish abundance less menhaden, proportion of planktivores, proportion of carnivores, and proportion of benthivores.
Data are ranked within sites and a score is assigned based on the severity of the impact.
Scores are adjusted to range between one and 10 (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).
Watersheds whose score value is in the upper 25 percent of scores receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Non-Tidal Instream Habitat Index This indicator is based on seven measures of instream habitat quality that are scored for each site based on observations of habitat condition in streams during sample visits.
The seven habitat measures rate the quantity and quality of physical habitat available in the stream for fish and benthic macroinvertebrate colonization and rate the degree to which the stream channel has been altered due to alterations in watershed landscape.
A mean for these seven measures is calculated for each site, and the mean habitat score for watersheds on a one to 10 scale is reported (one - most degraded, 10 best condition).Watersheds whose score value is in the upper 25 percent of scores receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Non-Tidal Fish Index of Biotic Integrity This indicator is developed from Maryland Biological Stream Survey and Targeted Watershed Project data.
Fish are collected using the same methods in both of these programs.
Scores for watersheds are reported as means for the sites within each watershed (one most degraded, 10 best condition).Watersheds with a score greater than 8, and whose number of samples taken was at least 4, receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Imperiled Aquatic Species Indicator This living resources indicator rates watersheds according to number and diversity of aquatic species listed as rare, endangered, threatened, or otherwise of special concern.
Scores range from 0 to 10.
Watersheds with a score greater than 0 receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Migratory Fish Spawning Area This living resources indicator rates watersheds based on the diversity of spawning habitat for American Shad, Hickory Shad, Blueback Herring, White Perch, Striped Bass, and Yellow Shad.
This indicator scores watersheds based on the number of migratory fish species (0-7) that spawn within the watershed (0 - most degraded, 7 - best condition).
Watersheds with a score greater than 0 receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Anadromous Fish Index This indicator is scored based on the number of ecologically valuable anadromous and semi-anadromous fish caught per haul.
Data are ranked within sites and a score is assigned based on the severity of the impact.
Scores are adjusted to range between one and 10 (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).Watersheds whose score value is in the upper 25 percent of scores receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Wetland-Dependent Species This indicator is the weighted average number of vertebrate species dependent on a wetland area normalized by NWI wetland area (acres).
Watersheds whose wetland-dependent species value is in the top 25 percent of the watersheds receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Trout Spawning Area This living resources indicator identifies watersheds where populations of brown, rainbow, and brook trout are known to reproduce.
Scores range between one and 10 (one - most degraded, 10 - best condition).Watersheds with a score greater than 0 receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Fish Hatchery Water Supply This indicator is the number of fish hatchery water supplies in the watershed.
Watersheds that have the presence of fish hatchery water supplies receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Landscape Indicators
Percent Headwater Streams Occurring in Interior Forest This indicator is defined as the number (feet) of first order (Strahler method) streams within interior forest divided by the first order stream length (feet).
Watersheds whose percent headwater streams occurring in interior forest value is in the top 25 percent of the watersheds receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Percent Watershed Forested This indicator is defined as the number of 1994 forested acres within a watershed divided by the total land acres in a watershed.
Watersheds whose percent watershed forested value is in the top 25 percent of the watersheds receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Wildland Acres This indicator is the number (acres) of MD DNR wildlands in the watershed.
Watersheds that have the presence of wildlands receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.
Number of Drinking Water Intakes This indicator is the number of drinking water intakes in the watershed.
Watersheds that have the presence of drinking water intakes receive a Category 3 rating for this indicator.

How can I get involved in the Clean Water Action Plan?
As part of the federal Clean Water initiative, the State of Maryland, in cooperation with local governments, watershed organizations and other stakeholders, has developed a draft Clean Water Action Plan to help guide the State's watershed management efforts.
Through this process, the State has created a draft list of priority watersheds needing restoration.
Restoration strategies will be developed for these priority watersheds that will include an action plan for restoration.
How can you get involved in this process? The State sought additional information from people familiar with local watersheds.
During September (1998), six regional meetings were held throughout the State hosted by the State's Tributary Strategy Teams.
The public was encouraged to attend, to learn about the Clean Water Action Plan, contribute local information about the condition of rivers and streams in these watersheds and send comments to the State about the process.
The list and location of meetings held follows.
Upper Marlboro Frederick Douglas High School Wednesday, September 2, 7-9pm
Cumberland Allegany Community College Wednesday, September 9, 7-9pm
Baltimore Essex Community College Thursday, September 10, 7-9pm
Easton Chesapeake College Wednesday, September 16, 7-9pm
Frederick Winchester Hall Wednesday, September 23, 7-9pm
Salisbury Salisbury State University Tuesday, September 29, 7-9pm
The State is interested in collecting information about watersheds for future assessments.
Contact Dr. Paul Massicot at (410) 260-8682 for information on providing watershed information.
The public also is invited to attend meetings of the Tributary Strategy teams.
For further information about the Tributary Strategy program, contact Darlene Walker at (410) 260-8708.
