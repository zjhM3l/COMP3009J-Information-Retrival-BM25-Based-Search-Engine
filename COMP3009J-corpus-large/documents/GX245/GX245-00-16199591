C. SPECIAL PROGRAMS (Part 1)
Special education, gifted and talented education, bilingual/English as a Second Language (ESL) and compensatory education are provided in Texas schools to serve students with special needs.
Other pilot projects in the state are combining technology and educational delivery for gifted and talented students.
As part of the Comptroller's e-Texas initiative, four school districts, Paris, Plainview, Pharr-San Juan-Alamo and Donna are participating in a pilot Internet program designed to take advantage of the technology offered in the 21st century that can open many learning opportunities for Texas' students.
Texas state law requires all school districts to identify and provide services for gifted and talented students.
Section 29.122 of the Texas Education Code states that school districts "shall adopt a process for identifying and serving gifted and talented students in the district and shall establish a program for those students in each grade level."
In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students.
This plan is a guide for meeting the law's requirements.
In 1996, the SBOE updated the plan to incorporate Texas Education Code Section 29.123 requirements.
The updated plan forms the basis for program accountability for state-mandated services for gifted and talented students.
Exhibit 2- 28 shows enrollment figures and expenditures for the gifted and talented program in LCISD and its peer districts.
LCISD ranks fifth among its peer districts in the expenditure amount per student ($156).
This amount is significantly lower than the state and Region 1 average expenditure per gifted and talented student.

LCISD begins screening students for GT services in pre-kindergarten and offers a GT curricula in kindergarten through twelfth grades.
At the elementary level there are two GT trained teachers per grade level.
In kindergarten through third grade, students identified as GT are placed with one of the GT trained teachers.
Students in the fourth and fifth grades work on special projects and meet as a group with one of the GT teachers as needed to complete their work.
Middle school gifted students are served through GT/honors courses in English, Math Science and Social Studies.
The administrator for Curriculum and Instruction said that teachers hold higher expectations of GT students and modify honors curricula to challenge these students.
High school students are served through Pre-AP (Advanced Placement) and AP classes in English, Math, Science and Social Studies.
Advanced students also are able to obtain dual high school/college credit courses through the College Connections Program offered through Texas State Technical College and through the Long Distance Learning program offered through the University of Texas Pan-American.
The district is a member of the gifted and talented cooperative offered through Region 1.
Through this cooperative arrangement, the Region provides training and assistance to district staff.
FINDING
The district does not have updated curriculum guides for the gifted and talented program.
The teachers compile teaching strategies and materials from the Internet and other sources.
Gifted students at the high school level are served through AP courses.
The percent of students completing advanced courses is low.
Only 11.
3 percent of Lyford students completed advanced courses, compared with more than 19 percent in Region 1 and 20 percent statewide.
Two peer districts, Raymondville and Progresso had more than 40 percent of students completing advanced courses.
Exhibit 2-29 also shows that while the percent of LCISD students taking the SAT/ACT test is similar to the state, the percent of these students that score above the criteria is lower than the state, Region 1 and one peer district.

The Gifted and Talented program is one of the many programs under the direction of the administrator for Curriculum and Instruction.
She relies on school principals and services from Region 1 to assist with program implementation, development and staff training.
The Texas Association for Gifted and Talented Students (TAGT) (www.txgifted.org) offers a variety of publications and training materials to help schools districts improve and implement gifted and talented programs.
The association also provides several staff development opportunities for teachers and coordinators.
Other pilot projects in the state are combining technology and educational delivery for gifted and talented students.
As part of the Comptroller's e-Texas initiative, four school districts, Paris, Plainview, Pharr-San Juan-Alamo and Donna are participating in a pilot Internet program designed to take advantage of the technology offered in the 21st century that can open many learning opportunities for Texas' students.
The project is coordinated by the Comptroller's office with the help of The University of Texas' High School Distance Learning Center, the Texas Association for the Gifted and Talented, IBM and Cisco Systems.
IBM is providing laptop computers, a server and special software to each participating school district.
Cisco Systems will provide technical support to access the Internet.
Both companies have been successful nationally and internationally with education-related projects.
This initial pilot project specifically targets gifted and talented students.
Region 1 and 3 participating school districts: Edcouch-Elsa Independent School District, La Feria Independent School District and La Villa Independent School District have been charged with establishing and operating a model Gifted and Talented/Bilingual Program for students.
Through a restructuring process teachers, counselors, administrators and parents will collaborate to review, evaluate and use traditional and non-traditional assessment and identification processes among potentially gifted and talented students.
The three participating school districts will work with nationally recognized researchers and educators to develop and restructure the gifted education curricula and accompanying materials.
