These call signs have a three-fold purpose.
They identify the nationality of the station, the type of station, and the individual station.
Radio call signs, in effect, are the "license plates" that identify communication traffic on the radio highways.
The need for station identification is emphasized by the fact that the United States, which leads all other countries in the use of radio, now has some 85 different kinds of radio services providing land, sea, air and space communication services.
HOW CALL SIGNS ARE DESIGNATED
Since the early days of wireless telegraphy, starting with marine use, radio stations have had their own identification.
Under international agreement, since 1927 the alphabet has been divided among nations for basic call sign use.
The United States, for example, is assigned three letters--N,K, and W-- to serve as initial call letters for the exclusive use of its radio stations.
It also shares the initial letter A with some other countries.
The letter A is assigned to the Army and Air Force; N to the Navy and Coast Guard, and K and W to domestic stations, both government and non-government.

This is done on an individual station basis.
A and N block assignments are designated for government use.
Further details on the FCC's requirements for the identification of radio stations may be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 2, (Subpart D) of the rules.
Some types of radio stations and equipment, such as radar stations and diathermy equipment, are exempt from such requirements.
BROADCAST STATION IDENTIFICATION
Broadcast stations in this country are assigned call signs beginning with K or W. Generally speaking, those beginning with K are assigned to stations West of the Mississippi River and in U.S. territories and possessions, while those beginning with W are assigned to broadcast stations East of the Mississippi River.
During radio's infancy, most of the broadcast stations were in the East.
As stations began operating, the Mississippi became the dividing line between K and W call signs.
The few exceptions to existing call signs within this system were assigned before the allocation plan was adopted.
Station KDKA, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is one example.
Since the beginning of broadcasting, stations have had the privilege of requesting specific call signs.
In requesting their preferences for certain letters of the alphabet, broadcasters have presented combinations of names, places or slogans.
For example, the letters NBC are used for stations owned by the National Broadcasting Company, CBS for those of the Columbia Broadcasting System, and ABC for the American Broadcasting Companies.
Examples of individual station call letters are: WGN, Chicago ("World's Greatest Newspaper"), WNYC, New York (New York City municipal station); KAGH, Crossett, AK, ("Keep Arkansas Green Home"); WIOD, Miami ("Wonderful Isle of Dreams"); WLS, Chicago ("Worlds Largest Store"); WACO, Waco Texas); WTOP, Washington, D.C.
("Top of the Dial"); KFDR, Grand Coulee, Washington, (Franklin D. Roosevelt); WCFL, Chicago ("Chicago Federation of Labor"); WMTC Vancleve, KY, ("Win Men to Christ"); WGCD, Chester, S.C.
("Wonderful Guernsey Center of Dixie"); Educational TV station WXXW, Chicago, uses the Roman numerals for its channel 20; and KABL, Oakland, CA, selected its letters to represent San Francisco's famous cable cars.
If a new broadcast station makes no specific request, it is assigned a call sign by the FCC.
Since 1946 the FCC has not guaranteed specific call signs to be granted prior to the grant of a construction permit or special temporary authority.
As broadcast stations began to increase in the early 1920's, the three letter call sign could no longer accommodate the growing number of stations, making it necessary to add a fourth letter.
With the advent of FM and TV in 1941, new call signs for all such stations were not assigned.
Rather, since many FM and TV stations were operated by the same AM licensee at the same license area, the general practice was for the associated FM or TV station to simply add "-FM" or "-TV", to the call sign of the co-owned AM station.
International Radio Regulations do not require the use of call signs by broadcast stations if some other suitable means of identification is employed.
For example, many foreign stations identify by announcing, "The Voice of ... "or "Radio..."
AMATEUR CALL SIGNS
Amateur radio station call signs are assigned by an automatic system that selects the call sign from an alphabetical listing depending upon the operator's license class and mailing address.
Although amateur call signs are for the purpose of identifying the station rather than the operator, call signs are often personal in nature.
For example, these call signs often appear on correspondence and on automobile license plates, i.e. NJ9AZ.
There are even grave stones bearing the cherished call signs of amateurs who have sent their final sign-off signal "SK".
DISTRESS CALLS
Records indicate that a British vessel used radio as early as 1899 to summon aid.
The first radio distress call from an American vessel has been traced to 1905.
But radio operator Jack Binns made headlines in 1909 when he stuck to his post on the stricken steamship REPUBLIC to send the distress signal then in use, "CQD".
In 1912 the ill fated TITANIC flashed the same call.
Before the turn of the century there was no special radiotelegraph call for emergencies at sea.
One pioneer operator simply sent the letters "HELP" in code.
In 1903, Italy suggested "SSSDDD" as an international radio emergency call.
By 1904, a number of ships engaged in Atlantic trade were equipped with "wireless", as radio was then known, and they recruited land telegraph operators for sea duty.
These operators resorted to the landline general call "CQ", meaning "attention all stations".
In 1904, the Marconi Company added the letter "D" to signal distress
Meanwhile, German ships had been using "SOE" and in 1906 Germany recommended these letters as an international distress call.
This combination was deemed unsatisfactory to radiotelegraphy because the final dot was often obliterated by static or other interference.
The American delegation to an international conference suggested "NC", which is the call for help in flag signaling.
However, international agreement was reached on "SOS", which became effective in 1906, though "CDQ" continued to be used by British ships for some years thereafter.
For radiotelephone purposes, or voice transmission, the international distress call is "MAYDAY", which corresponds to the French phrase "m'aider" meaning "help me".
It was adopted from a British proposal approved by an international convention in 1927.
It has since been used by military as well as civilian ships and aircraft.
In 1963, an international telecommunication conference agreed that the distress signals "SOS" and "MAYDAY" should also be used in space communication.
The Communications Act specifically bans transmission of false or deceptive signals.
