To analyze available sources they identify the different interests, opinions, and attitudes reflected in the evidence (points of view) and understand the vantage point of those who created the evidence (frames of reference).
Then they place the people and events in historical context, relating them to other events and ideas which occurred at the same time.
By doing so, students gain a greater understanding of what happened and how it relates to current events.
For instance, the Constitution reflects conflicting agendas of special interest groups.
Described by many as a document which furthered democracy, others argued that it hindered it.
The first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, were added later to satisfy those interested in protecting the people from the powers of a strong central government.
The Federalist and Anti-Federalist debates at ratification provide further evidence of conflicting points of view which contributed to the U.S. Constitution as it exists today.
The farmer in Massachusetts had an opinion about the Constitution as did the planter of Virginia and the merchant in Charleston, South Carolina.
Any explanation of the significance of the Constitution and its heritage remains incomplete if the points of view which cause differences of opinion are not understood and acknowledged.

To analyze available evidence they identify the different interests, opinions, and attitudes reflected in the evidence (points of view).
Thus they gain a greater understanding of the values, beliefs, political and national allegiances, economic and class status, and goals of the witnesses to the event.
Witnesses consider different things important and these are reflected in their descriptions of and reflections on contemporary events.
Reading and using evidence requires skill to recognize and understand the range of information contained.
For example, those who moved west left behind established government and business and often created new forms in the lands they settled.
Their ideas of the availability of the land differed from those of the Native Americans who lived on the land prior to the arrival of the settlers.
The Texans who defended the Alamo differed in their goals from the soldiers who fought for Santa Anna.
The perspectives of immigrants arriving in Texas were different than those of long-term residents in areas where the newcomers settled.
A more complete understanding of the significance of the siege of the Alamo, settlement by different ethnic groups, and the legacy of cultural interaction in Texas derives from recognizing the points of view evident in the sources documenting each events.

Context - [World History] Historians and social scientists strive to understand what happened in the past but are often limited by incomplete evidence.

They become critical thinkers in the process.
For instance, the French Revolution reflects conflicting agendas of special interest groups.
The movement originated in aspirations of a rising middle class which sought rights to "liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression," as proclaimed in the "Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen."
Their representatives on the National Assembly denied the nobles some of their traditional privileges by eliminating manorialism, thus making all French citizens equal in the law.
Over time the reformers became more radical.
They abolished the monarchy, seized the land owned by the Roman Catholic Church, and executed King Louis XVI in January 1793.
These incidents and others during the decade of revolution provide evidence of the points of view of the time ranging from the King of France and his family to the members of the middle class who affected change and the peasants freed from their obligations to nobility.
Any explanation of the significance of the French Revolution of 1789 and its heritage remains incomplete if the points of view which caused the conflict are not understood and acknowledged.
Members of the mob in Paris who stormed the Bastille on July 14 had an opinion about the actions needed to change French society as did the merchant involved in the National Assembly and the nobility relying on peasants to produce wheat for consumption and trade.
The information each acquired differed based on their participation in the events and the effects the events had on them.
Just as the perception of a football player on the line of scrimmage differs from that of the referee and of the fan sitting in the bleachers, the frame of reference of the Marquis de Lafayette who commanded the National Guard or radicals such as Maximilien Robespierre who sought to create a republic of virtue differed from that of the King or the peasants.
Historians and other social scientists also have a frame of reference, one based in the present, and informed by new approaches and methods.
They analyze the available evidence by sorting through it, prioritizing it, distinguishing important information from the less important, and interpreting it.
Thus, interpretations of one event change over time, partially due to new ways to look at old sources.
New sources also contribute to new understandings.
Thus, some historians consider the French Revolution as a triumph of democracy which followed on the heels of the successful American Revolution and drafting of the U.S. Constitution.
Others argue that the short-lived effort in France failed to address the economic and political problems which riddled the nation.
The effort failed after ten years when the military dictator, Napoleon Bonaparte, gained power.

Those who master the process gain a greater understanding of the values, beliefs, political and national allegiances, economic and class status, and goals of those represented in the sources.
For example, ethnic conflict involves more than racial differences.
Members of ethnic groups pursue different interests derived from religious and cultural beliefs.
It may be difficult to understand the status of women in traditional Muslim societies if a person's point of view does not encompass Muslim beliefs.
Recognizing the point of view a member of another culture expresses begins by comprehending, not necessarily adopting, their outlook.

Parties reflect different points of view regarding structures of governance, economics and national finance, political representation, and rights and responsibilities of individuals, states, and the nation.
Politically active people with competing interests, opinions, and attitudes united under party names to argue their causes.
In the 1830s published party platforms and public debates developed to inform voters of the goals and objectives proposed by each party.
The Anti-Masonic party held the first natio Patconvention in 1831.
Republicanism and constitutional democracy require representation of different points of view and involvement of different interest groups.
The Constitution resulted from rigorous debate between those favoring a strong central government and those favoring a union of sovereign states.
Those favoring a centralized government also believed in classical republicanism, with power vested in representatives who were fit to lead due to their wealth and education.
This contrasted to opinions held by states' rights advocates who believed in popular or mass participation in government.
Tension continued between these factions and resulted in threats to nullify national laws or to secede from the union.
The authority of the federal government was re-enforced during the Civil War when President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, accepted nothing less than full compliance with national causes on the part of the largely Democratic south.
Special interest groups often function within the two-party system.
This increased during the Progressive movement on the local and state levels in the 1890s to 1900s, and on the national and international levels in the 1910s and 1920s.
Differing points of view also result in the formation of third-parties, the Anti-Masons, the Populists, the Socialists, and the Liberal Party to name a few.
