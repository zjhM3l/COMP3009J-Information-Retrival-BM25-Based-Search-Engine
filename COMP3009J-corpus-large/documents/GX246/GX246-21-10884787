JAMESTOWN SETTLEMENT THEME
JAMESTOWN: THE BEGINNING
VHS, Color, 18 Minutes, 1990, ES-MS-HS-A (Available in Open Caption for hearing impaired)
This orientation film, shown daily at the Jamestown Settlement Galleries, portrays the early years of settlement from 1607 through 1637.
This dramatic first person narration, from the perspective of carpenter John Laydon, depicts the formation of the Virginia Company, the social and economic forces which encouraged exploration, as well as the voyage and conditions experienced during initial settlement.
Relations among the settlers and between settlers and Native Americans are portrayed focusing on hardships encountered as well as the role of tobacco in the eventual success of the Virginia colony.
Teachers are strongly encouraged to utilize this video to help prepare students for their visit.
THE POWHATAN INDIANS: A 17TH CENTURY CULTURE
Â¾" VHS Video, Color, 15 Minutes, 1990, ES-MS-HS
This video, which was taped in the re-created Powhatan Village at Jamestown Settlement, explores the 17th century culture of the Powhatan Indians as it existed at the time of European contact.
With the assistance of a group of Native Americans, the tape explains the farming, hunting and tool making techniques of the Powhatan while investigating work roles.
THREE SHIPS; THREE STORIES: THE JAMESTOWN EXPERIENCE
Â¾" VHS Video, Color, 20 Minutes, 1989, ES-MS-HS
This video provides an overview of the Jamestown experience.
The voyage to Virginia, the Native American culture existing in 1607, and problems and success of the English settlers are discussed.
Taped in the interpretative areas at Jamestown Settlement, this is an excellent pre-visit activity.
THE VOYAGE OF THE GODSPEED
Â¾" U-Matic and/or 16mm or VHS, Color, 60 Minutes, 1986, MS-HS-A
This interesting film tells the story of the 1985 retracing of the 1607 voyage of the Godspeed from England to Jamestown.
A crew of 20th century sailors set out from England on a replica of the original Godspeed and spent six months crossing the Atlantic.
The greatest benefit for students is the understanding of the hardships involved in navigation a sailing vessel thousands of miles across the ocean.

YORKTOWN VICTORY CENTER THEME
HARD WINTER
VHS, Color, 59 Minutes, 1984, MS-HS-A
In the winter of 1779-1780, 12,000 men of the American, Continental Army camped near Morristown, New Jersey.
This film dramatizes the problems that occurred between a starving army and a community that was expected to feed, clothe and supply that army.
The presentation also deals with two other controversial questions: the treatment of Tories and a person's right to speak out in favor of issues generally unacceptable to a community (in this case, freedom for slaves).
Hard Winter presents an aspect of the American Revolution that is not often dealt with, and that in itself makes it a valuable tool for the classroom teacher.
Due to certain scenes, this film should not be shown to young audiences.
PRESCRIPTIONS FROM THE PAST: COLONIAL MEDICINE
VHS, Color, 30 Minutes, 1990, MS-HS-A
Peer into the world of colonial medicine.
Hear one theory of disease explained and see how the doctor would have treated sickness based on the Humoral Theory.
Inside the tent of a Revolutionary War surgeon, discover the medicines and implements of doctors while learning about the ailments and problems of the 18th century.
A woman's role in medicine is portrayed with everyday tasks and a recipe used to treat the sick.
This video adds new insights into a significant concern of the 18th-century.
The theory, technology and application of colonial medicine are explained through close-up views of doctor's tools, medicines, recipes and procedures presented by costumed interpreters in a living history setting.
SIEGE OF YORKTOWN
VHS, Color, 15 Minutes, MS-HS-A
This information film begins in 1780 with the stalemates between the British and the colonial armies in America.
Events are traced from the battles at Charlestown, to King's Mountain, Cowpens, Guilford Courthouse, and finally to the English decision to secure a port at Yorktown.
The remainder, and majority, of the film deals in great detail with the strategies employed by both sides at the October, 1781, battle at Yorktown, and concludes with the British surrender and its implications for complete American victory and independence two years later.
Battle scenes and on-site production enhance the interest level of the film.
TO KEEP OUR LIBERTY
VHS, Color, 12 minutes, 1974, MS-HS-A
This recreation of the events of 1763-1775 that led to the American Revolution is presented through the eyes of a single colonist.
Beginning with the end of the Seven Year's War (known in America as the French and Indian War), the colonist- guide travels through colonial America to discover the attitudes of the English colonial policy.
He finds that most colonists were not angered by the English policy of requiring the colonies to pay for their own defense, but that their attitudes greatly changed with the arrival of a standing English `army in America.
Colonial belligerence toward these troops is increased by the Stamp Act (seen by colonials as a way of paying for the army), the Boston Massacre and the Intolerable Acts.
The film concludes with the arrival in America of General Gage and the subsequent events that Led to the battles of Lexington and Concord.
This National Park Service film does an excellent job of presenting, in an easily understandable fashion, the events that led to the American Revolution.
