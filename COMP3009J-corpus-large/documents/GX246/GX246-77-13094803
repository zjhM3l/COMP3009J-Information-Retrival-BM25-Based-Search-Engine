WHEREAS, the human embryo is a living organism of the species Homo sapiens at the earliest stages of development (including the single-celled stage), and human cloning creates a human being at the embryonic stage of life and grows this new human being solely to be exploited ("reproductive" cloning) or destroyed (so-called "therapeutic" cloning) through nontherapeutic research and experimentation; and WHEREAS, human cloning is a manufacturing process in which a human being is created in a laboratory; human cloning indicates a utilitarian view in which a human being is created merely for usefulness with no respect for the dignity of that human being; and human cloning creates a human being who is the twin of a parent, has no other biological parent, and is the child of the grandparents thereby causing serious moral, social, and legal issues; and WHEREAS, current human cloning attempts pose a substantial risk of producing human beings with unpredictable but potentially devastating health problems; and WHEREAS, such human cloning attempts are grossly irresponsible and unethical; and WHEREAS, the United States House of Representatives has passed the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001, a complete human cloning ban, and the President of the United States has called for a complete human cloning ban; and WHEREAS, a complete human cloning ban is achieved by the passage of the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 as introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Brownback (S. 1899) and is not achieved by the passage of other human cloning prohibition acts that allow the creation of human embryos by cloning so long as they are killed for research.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that the United States House of Representatives is strongly urged to continue its support of a complete human cloning ban, that the United States Senate is strongly urged to pass the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001, as introduced in the Senate by Senator Brownback, and that the President of the United States is strongly urged to sign a complete human cloning ban.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized and directed to transmit an appropriate copy of this resolution to each member of the Georgia congressional delegation.
