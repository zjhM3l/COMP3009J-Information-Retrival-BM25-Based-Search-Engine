See sample data, long form, and short form.
100 percent edited detail file HEDF Files composed of individual records of information on persons and housing units for the 100 percent census data items from the census questionnaires.
Estimation is included in these files.
These files are used for tabulation purposes and are not released to the public.
A Streamlined Acquisition Process ASAP The process the Census Bureau uses to acquire services.
There are six phases: 1) bureau integrated strategic planning and budgeting, 2) project planning, 3) market research, 4) selection acquisition vehicle, 5) meet project objective and manage acquisition, and 6) close-out.

The lister also updates and corrects the map if necessary.
Address range The lowest and highest house numbers along each side of a street segment that has city-style addresses.
The U.S. Census Bureau usually expands the range to include all possible numbers, not just the existing ones (for example, the Census Bureau expands the actual addresses of 105-131 on the odd numbered side of the 100 block of a street to 101-199).
Usually an address range on one side of a street contains only even or only odd numbers, but sometimes one or both sides contain both.
Address register AR A book used by field staff to record or verify addresses and related information for all living quarters in an assignment area.
It also includes: 1) instructions on how to perform the job and 2) a set of maps for the assigned area.

Homogeneity Homogeneity assumes that all people in a particular sampling stratum or poststratum have an equal chance of being included or missed by the census or survey.
A lack of homogeneity in a particular sample block is not an error, but it does create difficulty for the small area estimation process.
This happens because the correction factor is applied to all people with the specified characteristic in that poststratum even though some of them do not exhibit the same coverage characteristic.

Hybrid mailing A national concept considered for Census 2000 but not implemented: a combination of targeted and blanket mailings for replacement questionnaires within a local census office.
Certain multi-units were excluded.
Identification number See census identification number.
Imputation When information is missing or inconsistent, the Census Bureau uses imputation to assign values.
Imputation relies on the tendency of households of the same size within a small geographic area to be similar in most characteristics.
For example, the value of "rented" is likely to be imputed for a housing unit not reporting on owner/renter status in a neighborhood with multi-units or apartments where other respondents reported "rented" on the census questionnaire.
There are two major types of imputation: 1) allocation, in which missing values for individual items are filled in on the basis of other reported information for the person or household (or from other persons or households with similar characteristics) and 2) substitution, in which all of the information for a person or household is created from other persons or households with similar characteristics.
Incorporated place A type of governmental unit incorporated under state law as a city, town (except the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin), borough (except in Alaska and New York), or village and having legally prescribed limits, powers, and functions.

Integrated Coverage Measurement ICM This operation was proposed for Census 2000 but will not be implemented.
The objective of such an operation is to measure how well the Census Bureau counted people and housing in a census.
A large-scale sample survey is conducted independently of regular census operations.
The sample consists of block clusters in urban and rural areas.
The results are matched to census results and estimates of the undercount are created.
It is a micro-level approach, that is, case-by-case matching.
There are three phases to such an operation.
In the housing unit phase, an inventory of housing within sample blocks is conducted separately from the census.
In the computer assisted person interview (CAPI) phase, an independent sample of nonrespondents is taken, and telephone and personal visit second interviews are conducted to create an independent roster.
In the person matching phase, persons enumerated in the census are matched to persons enumerated in the CAPI phase, followup interviews for discrepancies are conducted, unresolved cases are imputed as a last resort, and statistical procedures are used to produce estimates of the people missed or duplicated in the census.
The final phase of such an operation is to use the Dual System Estimation to compare the census counts to the ICM counts and create estimation factors to adjust the census results.
Also called the Quality Check Survey.

Nationally, or overall, one in six households will receive a long form.
This is a sample for content, that is, a sample determining which households receive the long form content.
Mail response rate The total number of checked-in questionnaires returned by mail divided by the number of questionnaires mailed by the U.S. Postal Service or delivered by census enumerators.
This check-in rate differs from a true mail response rate because it reflects forms that have been processed and not necessarily all of those that have been received.
Mail return rate The total number of households returning a questionnaire by mail divided by the number of occupied housing units that received a questionnaire by mail or by a census enumerator (the only ones that can return a questionnaire).

The TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database provides a resource for the production of maps, entity headers for tabulations, and automated assignment of addresses to a geographic location in a process known as "geocoding."
TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ was preceded by the GBF/DIME (Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding) files.
See automated master address file geocoding office operation, TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ improvement program, targeted map update, census map preview, Boundary and Annexation Survey, digital exchange file, and geocode.
TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ Improvement Program TIP This program provides all local governments and regional and metropolitan agencies the opportunity to assist the Census Bureau in locating and updating street features, street names, and address ranges identified as missing or incorrect in the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database.
This information is needed to link U.S. Postal Service addresses with the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database.
See automated master address file geocoding office operation, TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½, targeted map update, census map preview, Boundary and Annexation Survey, digital exchange file, and geocode.
TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½/Line File The computer-readable extract of the TIGERÃ¯Â¿Â½ database that the Census Bureau makes available to the public.
It contains data representing the roads, railroads, bodies of water, boundaries of legal and statistical entities, and other visible and nonvisible features, along with their attributes (names, address ranges, geographic codes, census feature class codes, and the like) Tool kit Special census methods and procedures available for improving cooperation or enumeration in hard-to-enumerate areas.
These are not normally scheduled operations but are available to the Census regional offices for use as needed.
Examples: targeting database, team and blitz enumeration, and urban update/leave.
Touchtone data entry TDE An automated data capture technology which allows a respondent, using the keypad of a touchtone telephone, to reply to computer generated prompts.
Town A type of minor civil division in the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin and a type of incorporated place in 30 states and the Virgin Islands of the United States.
See county subdivision, governmental unit, and incorporated place.
Tract Small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of counties delineated by local committees of census data users in accordance with Census Bureau guidelines for the purpose of collecting and presenting decennial census data.
These neighborhoods contain between 1,000 and 8,000 people, typically approximately 1,700 housing units and 4,000 people.
Tracts are designed to have homogeneous population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions at the time they are established.
Census tract boundaries normally follow visible features but may follow governmental unit boundaries and other nonvisible features.
There will be more than 60,000 census tracts in 2000.
See statistical entity and census statistical areas committee.
Tract number Used to uniquely identify a census tract within a county Traffic analysis zone TAZ An area defined by a metropolitan planning organization for tabulating transportation statistics from the census Transient location Includes living quarters with people who have no usual home elsewhere that were enumerated during transient, or T-Night, enumeration at YMCAs, YWCAs, hostels, commercial and government-run campgrounds, campgrounds at racetracks, fairs, carnivals, and marinas.
Census enumerators complete a (Simplified) Enumerator Questionnaire for the residents who do not have a home elsewhere.
These locations are classified as housing units.
Transient night or
T-Night,
T-Night enumeration T-NIGHT, TNE A method of enumeration in which Census Bureau staff enumerate people at transient locations, such as, campgrounds at racetracks, recreational vehicle campgrounds or parks, commercial or public campgrounds, fairs and carnivals, and marinas.
Enumerators conduct a personal interview using a (Simplified) Enumerator Questionnaire.
No vacant units are generated by this operation.
See transient location and (Simplified) Enumerator Questionnaire.
Transitional shelters Includes shelters providing a maximum stay for clients of up to 2 years and offering support services to promote self-sufficiency and to help clients obtain permanent housing.
These are service locations.
See emergency shelters; hotels, motels, or other facilities; regularly scheduled mobile food vans; service location; shelters for children who are runaways, neglected, or without housing; and soup kitchens.
Tribal designated statistical area TDSA An area identified outside Oklahoma by federal- and state- recognized tribes without a land base or associated land trust Tribal jurisdiction statistical area TJSA An area identified by Oklahoma tribal officials as containing the American Indian population over which they have jurisdiction Tribal Review Program A program in 1997 and 1998 to allow officials of all federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native entities to review and update the maps for Census 2000 for their jurisdictions.
Other programs involving map review for the American Indian/Alaska Native areas include Address Listing Map Review, Block Definition Project, Boundary and Annexation Survey, Census Map Preview, and Local Update of Census Addresses.
Turnover rate The total number of enumerators who quit during a field operation divided by the total number of enumerators hired for that operation Type of enumeration area TEA A classification identifying how the Census Bureau takes the decennial census of a geographic area.
Examples of possible TEAs include: * the area inside the "blue line."
For 2000, this is the mailout/mailback and urban update/leave operations.
* address listing areas * list/enumerate areas * remote areas of Alaska
See address listing, blue line, list/enumerate, mailout/mailback, rural update/enumerate, update/leave, and urban update/leave.
Undeliverable As addressed UAA A U.S. Postal Service notification that a mailing piece could not be delivered to the designated address.
Formerly called a postmaster return.
United States U.S.
The 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Unorganized territory UT The portion of a county that is not included in any legally established minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place in a state in which the Census Bureau recognizes MCDs for purposes of decennial census data presentation.
For purposes of data presentation, the Census Bureau may divide a large area of unorganized land into several UTs.
See county subdivision and statistical entity.
Update/enumerate U/E A method of enumeration in which enumerators update the mailing list obtained by address listing and other operations, update census maps, and simultaneously enumerate the area.
For enumeration, they canvass selected blocks and pick up completed, unaddressed questionnaires previously left by a mail carrier or complete a census questionnaire for each occupied and vacant housing unit.
For Census 2000, the Census Bureau will implement this methodology only in areas designated for rural update/enumerate.
See rural update/enumerate, type-of-enumeration area, and update/leave.
Update/leave U/L The objective is to update the address register while delivering questionnaires.
A method of data collection in which enumerators personally deliver a census questionnaire to a household and at the same time update the address list and census maps.
The household completes and returns the form by mail.
This method is primarily used for houses without city-style addresses.
See address listing, city-style address, list/enumerate, mailout/mailback, noncity-style address, type-of-enumeration area, and rural update/enumerate.
Urban All territory, population, and housing units in urbanized areas and in places of 2,500 or more persons outside urbanized areas.
The urban and rural classifications cut across other hierarchies; for example, there are generally both urban and rural territories within both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.
Urbanized area One or more places and the adjacent densely settled surrounding territory that together include at least 50,000 people.
Urban update/enumerate UU/E The objective is to update the address register while delivering questionnaires.
A method of enumeration within mailout/mailback areas in selected cities to enumerate blocks occupied almost entirely by boarded-up structures.
Enumerators complete a census questionnaire for each occupied and inhabitable housing unit, and update the address register and the census maps.
The Census Bureau does not plan to use this type of enumeration in Census 2000.
Urban update/leave UU/L Update/leave procedures are used in targeted urban areas where mail delivery may be a problem, such as, an apartment building where the mail carrier may leave the forms in a common area.
Enumerators deliver census questionnaires for residents to complete and mail back, update the address register, and update the census maps.
Urbanized area UA An area, consisting of one or more places and the adjacent urban fringe, containing at least 50,000 people and an overall population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile of land.
The Census Bureau uses published criteria to determine the qualification and boundaries of UAs.
See statistical entity.
U.S. Postal Service USPS The organization responsible for delivering the mail questionnaires in Census 2000 and the producer of the delivery sequence file Usual home elsewhere UHE A housing unit that is temporarily occupied by a person(s) who has a usual home elsewhere Usual residence The living quarters where a person spends more nights during a year than any other place Vacant housing unit A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in at the time of enumeration, unless the occupants are only temporarily absent.
Units temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration entirely by individuals who have a usual residence elsewhere are classified as vacant.
(Transient quarters, such as, hotels, are housing units only if occupied.
Thus, there are no vacant housing units at hotels and the like.)
New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.
Vacant units are excluded from the housing unit inventory if they are open to the elements.
Also excluded from the housing unit inventory are units with a posted condemnation sign or units that are used entirely for nonresidential purposes.
Vacant housing unit followup The verification of the occupancy status of all cases originally identified by either the U.S. Postal Service or an enumerator as addresses without occupants or addresses that are no longer housing units Village A type of incorporated place in 20 states and American Samoa.
The Census Bureau also treats all villages in New Jersey, South Dakota, and Wisconsin and some villages in Ohio as county subdivisions.
See governmental unit and incorporated place.
Visible feature A feature that can be seen on the ground, such as, a street or road, railroad track, power line, stream, shoreline, fence, ridge, or cliff.
A visible feature can be a manmade or natural feature.
See feature and visible feature.
Voice recognition entry VRE An automated data capture technology which allows a respondent, speaking over a telephone, to reply to computer generated prompts.
A component in the modular data-management network maintained by the Computer Assisted Survey Research Office.
Voting district/
legislative district VTD Any of a variety of types of areas, such as, election districts, precincts, wards, and legislative districts established by state and local governments for purposes of elections Walk-in questionnaire assistance center Places, such as, post offices, libraries, stores and malls, schools and community centers, and other places where people frequent where unaddressed questionnaires, called Be Counted forms, are offered in an attempt to ensure everyone has the opportunity to be counted.
The centers will be staffed by volunteers and Census Bureau employees.
Whole household usual home
elsewhere WHUHE See usual home elsewhere.
Wide area network WAN A group of computers linked within a network, such as, the Census Bureau's regional offices, to exchange and share information.
Whereas a "local area network" may link computers within a building or among several buildings, a WAN covers more area and distance.
See local area network.
Work breakdown structure WBS A way of organizing a project by a hierarchy of its components.
The master activity schedule is organized by a WBS with 13 components or major programs.
All Census 2000 program documentation and planning is keyed to this.
For example, the scope and content of the program master plans will be keyed to lines in the WBS and documents in the Census 2000 library referenced to the WBS.
ZIP + 4 A 4-digit code following a 5-digit ZIP code established by the U.S. Postal Service for the purpose of expediting mail delivery.
The 9-digit code generally identifies one side of a street segment of an entire cul-de-sac or similar dead-end street.
ZIP code ZIP ZIP codes are administrative units established by the U.S. Postal Service for the distribution of mail.
ZIP stands for zone improvement plan.
It is a 5-, 7-, 9-, or 11-digit code assigned by the U.S. Postal Service to a street or portion of a street, a collection of streets, a business, or other establishment or structure, or a group of post office boxes to expedite the delivery of mail.
The Census Bureau uses only 5-digit ZIP codes for the addresses and address ranges in most Census 2000 operations.
Zona urbana ZU In Puerto Rico, an area consisting of the municipio seat of government and the adjacent built-up area.
ZUs are delineated like census designated places, except that ZUs cannot cross municipio boundaries.
ZUs have never had to meet a minimum population threshold to qualify for tabulation of census data, a criterion that for Census 2000 applies for the first time to all census designated places.
See census designated place and comunidad.
