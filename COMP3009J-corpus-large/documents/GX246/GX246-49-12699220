Travel Security and its Impact on International Relations
In an effort to thwart terrorism and increase security, the United States government has implemented sweeping changes to security checkpoints in our nations airports.
The government is also asking for cooperation from its allies at airports worldwide.
For example, the United States government has asked that armed air marshals are present on transatlantic flights on a case-by-case basis as well as for new INS procedures that include fingerprinting those traveling to the United States on a visa.
However, there are hesitancies abroad surrounding the safety and necessity of these dramatic changes to air travel.
How will these changes affect our relationships with other nations? How real are the threats we see in the news? Are these threats exaggerated merely by the large amount of news coverage they receive? Join us as we discuss these and other related issues.
Date: Wednesday, February 11, 2004 Time: 12 Noon Location: The Boston Foundation, 75 Arlington Street, Boston Cost: Free for members; $20 for non-members Contact: WorldBoston, 617-542-8995 x112, wac@worldboston.org, www.worldboston.org
