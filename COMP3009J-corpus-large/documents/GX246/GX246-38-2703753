C. Reciprocity.
The commission shall conduct a review of the[DEL: :DEL] statutes of other jurisdictions pertaining to horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering to ascertain which jurisdictions have substantially the same standards as those of Virginia.
Upon submission of an application and payment of the prescribed fee by a holder of permit, license or other similar document from those jurisdictions whose standards for permits, licenses or similar documents are substantially the same, the commission may, in its discretion, grant reciprocity to the applicant provided that the applicant has not been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony.
D. Fingerprinting.
The applicant shall be fingerprinted upon making his initial application in the Commonwealth and at least once every five years thereafter.
The commission may waive this requirement in connection with an application for a permit by reciprocity with another jurisdiction provided that the applicant was fingerprinted and was subjected to a criminal history record information check in a jurisdiction whose laws governing fingerprinting and background investigations are substantially the same as required by Virginia and that he has not been convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony.
However, the commission, in its discretion, may require fingerprints from any applicant or holder of a permit at any time.
E. Consideration of application.
The commission, acting through its executive secretary or other designee, shall promptly consider any application for a permit and issue the permit based on the information contained in the application and all other information before it, including any investigation it deems appropriate.
If an application for a permit is approved, the commission shall issue the permit.
F. Denial of application.
If from the face of the application, an applicant appears ineligible because of the requirements specified in Ã¯Â¿Â½59.1-389 B of the Code of Virginia, his application shall be denied by the commission, acting through its executive secretary or other designee.
The commission may deny an application for a permit for the reason specified in Ã¯Â¿Â½59.1-389 C of the Code of Virginia.
Absent mitigating circumstances, the application for a permit shall be denied if the applicant has three or more misdemeanor convictions, regardless of offense, within five years preceding the application date.
If the applicant has multiple convictions of the same offense on the same day, it shall not constitute three or more misdemeanor convictions for purposes of this regulation.
The applicant may withdraw his application prior to denial.
G. Ineligible applicant.
If it appears that the applicant may be ineligible because he has committed a felony or misdemeanor that may be detrimental to horse racing in the Commonwealth, he shall be afforded the opportunity to withdraw his application or request a hearing before a steward regarding his application.
However, the commission, in its discretion, may issue a permit to an applicant providing the felony or misdemeanor is not one of those listed in Ã¯Â¿Â½59.1-389 C 6 of the Code of Virginia.
H. Felonies considered detrimental.
