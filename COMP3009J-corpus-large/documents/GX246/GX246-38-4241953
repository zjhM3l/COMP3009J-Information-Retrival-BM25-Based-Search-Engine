Citrus seems to have more than its share of devastating graft-transmissible pathogens, any of which, if given the opportunity, could seriously affect the profitability of citrus production in Florida.
Prevention of a pest introduction is always preferable to running eradication and control programs once the pathogen is present.
It is important to guard against the introduction of new pathogens, including graft-transmissible pathogens, into the Florida citrus industry.
The Citrus Budwood Protection Program also has a prime objective to limit the economic impact of graft-transmissible pathogens that are now endemic by preventing their unknowing widespread distribution through the nursery system.
The Citrus Budwood Protection Program safeguards our industry by making sure nurseries are producing trees from clean stock.The ability to test all commercial nursery-propagating sources for pathogens is important in keeping disease from being rapidly spread within the state.Graft-transmissible pathogens of citrus which do not have insect vectors can be readily controlled by the use of pathogen-free budwood.Pathogens having insect vectors cause substantially less damage when the citrus tree starts off pathogen-free.Monitoring for pathogens before they have a chance to enter our citrus nurseries reduces the risk to all of Florida's citrus industry.Ideally, source trees need to be grown in a screenhouse for protection from vectored diseases.
An important issue for the Citrus Budwood Protection Program is the need for delocalization of the germplasm presently available in the clean stock program.The occurrence of a quarantinable disease, such as citrus canker, in one of the foundations would create a shortage of clean budwood to satisfy the Florida citrus industry's need.The bureau is proactively looking to find an additional isolated site to diversify our budwood protection.
Budwood registration has the added benefit in allowing true-to-type budlines to be propagated.The selection of high quality cultivars for clonal propagation gives growers uniform plantings of high quality trees.The original mother stock selected for inclusion in the budwood program is horticulturally evaluated for superior performance.Horticultural evaluation is just as vital as pathogen testing of budwood sources.
The Bureau of Citrus Budwood Registration, together with the Citrus Germplasm Introduction Program, have been seeking new varieties to introduce into Florida.Meetings have been held with growers, nurserymen and researchers to seek industry suggestions of worthy cultivars to import into the state.New citrus selections will keep our industry competitive in the world market.Several new selections were made available to nurserymen this past year (reported on pages 17 and 46).
This has been a year of greenhouse construction and renovation.The screenhouse in Immokalee was doubled in size to a total of 12,672 sq. ft.A new 2,160 sq. ft. greenhouse was constructed in Winter Haven to house the bureau's pathogen collection.

Program activity
Nursery propagations have varied very little over the past four years.
There were 5.8 million propagations in 1999/2000 compared to 5.9 million in 1998/1999.This is enough trees to plant 46 thousand acres at the average of 125 trees per acre.
Since the budwood program began in 1953, enough registered trees have been budded to replant the entire commercial citrus acreage in the state.
Valencias continue to be the favorite variety in the nurseries as well as in the commercial groves.Sweet oranges are the principal citrus type grown in Florida.
Sweet oranges represent 85 percent of the citrus being produced, and 53 percent of the sweet oranges propagated were Valencias.Rohde Red accounted for 13 percent of the Valencia propagations.
Hamlins are the second most popular variety, making up 26 percent of the citrus trees produced, and are the leading early season orange.Midsweet is the most utilized midseason orange selection and the third most popular variety.Pineapple midseason orange is the fifth most popular variety.
Ruby Red grapefruit is the fourth most popular variety propagated.Marsh grapefruit is sixth in popularity.
Flame is the ninth most popular variety.Grapefruit propagations increased 176 percent.This is an increase from 3 percent last year to 8.6 percent of all propagations this year.
Murcott continues to be the leading mandarin variety propagated as it has for the past eight seasons.Minneola tangelo is the second most propagated mandarin type.Sunburst propagations have fallen off 36 percent.
Earlygold is one of several new varieties that were introduced this past year.Earlygold, an early-season orange, became the tenth most popular variety budded in its first year of propagation.Four other sweet orange varieties released at the same time (Vernia, Westin, Ruby Sweet, Itaborai) have also shown good response among growers.

Commercial Citrus Nurseries
There are a total of 108 commercial citrus nurseries in Florida with 20 of these being strictly own use.
Seventy-five of the commercial and own use nurseries were active in 1999/2000, thirty-three nurseries reported making no propagations.
The majority of the citrus nurseries are located in central Florida with Polk and Highlands counties number one and two respectively.
Polk county nurseries accounted for 2.2 million propagations, while Highlands county contributed 1.5 million.
The average number of trees propagated per commercial nursery was approximately eighty-six thousand trees.
Own use nurseries propagated ten thousand trees on average.
Field nurseries predominate among citrus nurseries growing more than 100,000 trees.
Greenhouse containerized nurseries make up the majority of nurseries below 100,000 trees.
Twenty-three percent of the citrus nurseries propagated more than 100,000 trees this year.
Thirty-three percent of commercial citrus nurseries propagated less than 10,000 trees.
Ten nurseries propagate fifty-nine percent of the total nursery trees for the citrus industry.
Twenty-five nurseries propagate 87 percent of the trees.
Fifty nurseries produce ninety-seven percent of all the trees.

Budwood cutting
All budwood cutting must be witnessed by a person authorized to fill out the Source Tree Bud Cutting Report.
A representative is formally trained and authorized to perform the budwood cutting duties for each nursery that has its own budwood sources.
Sixty-four participants have a total of 119 individuals trained and authorized to witness budwood cutting for their own nurseries.
Prior to authorizing nursery employees to handle the bud cutting paperwork, Division of Plant Industry inspectors had the responsibility.
Allowing nurserymen to witness cutting their own propagating stock has been beneficial in giving nurseries greater flexibility in cutting budwood and freeing up the division inspectors to perform other inspection duties.
The training and certification of authorized witnesses is important in obtaining accurate information on the Source Tree Bud Cutting Reports.
The information from these reports is utilized in compiling the data for this annual report.
Traditionally, most citrus budding has occurred in the spring and fall months.
The increase of greenhouse produced stock has contributed to year-round budding.
There is a definite nursery slowdown during the cooler winter months.
How data is reported
All propagation data reported in this fiscal year is taken from Source Tree Bud Cutting Reports and reported as amount of budwood cut.
The actual number of viable nursery trees grown may be less than the number reported.
The number of trees budded averaged 80 percent of the amount cut and other culling factors may also reduce the figures accordingly.
This average was 89 and 92 percent the previous two years.
Program reporting for nursery propagation became mandatory in 1997.
Prior years data would reflect percentages in line with industry activity; however, the data would not represent 100 percent of nursery propagations.
Increase block yields are reported on page 8 as averages for selected Valencia and Hamlin clones from 13 different nurseries.
The range of the number of eyes cut varied significantly from nursery to nursery with some increase blocks yielding substantially more.

Hughes Memorial Budwood
The Hughes Memorial Foundation is a non-profit corporation established in 1961 for the purpose of providing funds for educational purposes, including scholarships, research grants and the like.Income is derived from citrus nursery industry contributions based on nursery propagation of the Hughes Nucellar Valencia selections.
Scholarship awards are presented annually to students attending Florida Southern College and the University of Florida whose major studies are in the field of citrus.
The awards are intended primarily as incentives to give recognition and encouragement to students to continue in the field of citriculture.
Since 1965 there have been 103 scholarships awarded, with a total value of $124,650.
This past year 1.4 million Hughes Nucellar Valencia trees were propagated from four different Hughes clones.
1999 - 2000 Hughes Nucellar Selections accounted for 23 % of total nursery propagations and 52 % of Valencia propagations.

Viroid Testing
Viroid testing is done in greenhouses using citron indicator plants and in the laboratory by PCR (polymerase chain reaction).Greenhouse indexing may take up to nine months to complete.
The laboratory PCR testing gives quicker results and can detect viroid infections at very low levels.
PCR duplicates the genetic material, which greatly increases the capacity of identifying precise segments of DNA or RNA.In pathogen indexing, this enhances our ability to detect viroids by amplifying the viroid RNA.This process is much quicker than traditional biological indexing; however, it is quite technical and labor intensive.The use of PCR will not replace biological indexing but rather strengthen and enhance the program.

Biological Greenhouse Viroid Testing
The bureau completed a total of 874 biological greenhouse tests to detect viroids this fiscal year.
Viroid test determinations were made from 35 scion groves.
Five positive trees from four scion groves were found last year, up from one tree the previous year.
The percentage of scion grove trees found to be positive increased from 0.06% last year to 0.48% this fiscal year.
Including positives found in parent candidate and validated source trees, a total of 21 positive trees were detected this year.
Citrus Tristeza Virus Testing
The 1999/2000 fiscal year was the fourth year for reporting annual citrus tristeza virus test results from source trees.
This year there was a continuing rise of severe and mild strains in some of our participating scion groves.
There was an 8.9% severe tristeza infection rate in scion trees compared to 5.9% last year.
This reflects new MCA-13 positive infections; usually only trees that were not previously severe are tested.

Immokalee Foundation Grove Testing
The Immokalee Foundation Grove was planted in 1989 and inoculated with mild citrus tristeza virus isolates in 1992 and 1993.
Citrus tristeza virus testing has been ongoing since 1990, with all severe CTV detections being removed from the planting through 1998.
The brown citrus aphid was first detected in the grove July 26, 1996.
Since this detection, the rate of severe CTV infection in the Immokalee grove has increased steadily.
Because of the high tristeza infection rate found in this grove, a moratorium was placed on budwood cutting in December 1998.
At that time a decision was made to no longer remove trees testing severe CTV from the planting.
Our Immokalee Foundation Grove had a 60% severe infection rate, up from 37.8% last year.
The current year test results and historical data of severe tristeza in the Immokalee Foundation Grove are shown on the following charts.
The Bureau of Citrus Budwood Registration does citrus tristeza virus testing in the Immokalee Foundation Grove.

The Florida Citrus Arboretum
This year the Florida Citrus Arboretum celebrated its 25^th year anniversary.
The Arboretum contains commercial citrus as well as citrus relatives and hybrids, with 432 trees representing 256 different varieties.
Budwood and seed are distributed to nurserymen and hobbyists.
The Arboretum supplied over 40,000 budeyes to nurserymen this past year.
Enthusiasts are given the opportunity to taste and purchase small quantities of fruit.
The Florida Citrus Arboretum had over 569 visitors this year.
The guests represented 9 countries and 16 different states.
The bureau exported 3,115 budeyes out of state this fiscal year.
Because of heightened awareness of citrus canker, landscaping was done around portions of the perimeter of the Arboretum to act as a living hedge to direct visitors to a spray decontamination station prior to entering the Arboretum.

Scion Trees
The majority of the propagating material used in citrus nurseries originates from scion groves.
Scion trees supplied 3.7 million budeyes this year.
The average scion tree supplied 2,667 budeyes during the year.
The average amount cut per cutting was 1,501 eyes.
All active scion trees must be tested annually for citrus tristeza virus and be registered in the Citrus Budwood Protection Program.
One sweet orange tree supplied 18,620 budeyes during the year.
Frequently trees are cut more than one time during the year.
The most eyes cut from a sweet orange tree in a single cutting was 15,848.
The largest quantity cut from grapefruit and mandarin trees at one cutting was 18,000 and 9,800 budeyes respectively.
The tables below represent 1999/2000 budwood cutting from program scion trees over a twelve-month period.
Averages account for some trees having multiple cuttings while others were used only once.
