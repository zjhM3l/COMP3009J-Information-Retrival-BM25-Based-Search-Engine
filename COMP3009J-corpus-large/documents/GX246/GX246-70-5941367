Whether it is HO, O or standard gauge, Plasticville houses or homemade creations, the hobby has captivated imaginations across the Mid-Atlantic for decades.
Many have never really given up that love of designing layouts and watching their favorite rail line circle a simple oval or negotiate a more complex series of switches, twists and turns.
It is that love of trains that has brought a group of community volunteers and staff from the Brandenburg Hospital Center in Cumberland together to bring the joy of model railroading to consumers of the Developmental Disabilities Administration facility in Western Maryland.
It really is a win-win situation, said Cindy Garner, a 22-year employee of the Center and a member of the Community Model Railroad Club.
They have the trains and we have the space, she said of the agreement that has enabled Club members to construct a permanent five-train display in the Centers Day Room.
Construction of the layout began in August and the trains will be making their appointed runs on weekends between Thanksgiving and New Years, according to Joe Brumage, leader of the Club and manager of a Cumberland-area drug store.
The approximate 18' by 16' display has been constructed with the Brandenburg consumer in mind.
