Pennsylvania Game Commission Logo Pennsylvania Game Commission News Release 2001 Elmerton AvenueÂ· Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17110-9797 Home What's New Newsroom Hunting - Trapping Wildlife Education County Reports Merchandise Release #74-02 September 18, 2002 PCN TO REBROADCAST GAME COMMISSION PHEASANT FARM TOURS FALL PHEASANT STOCKING PLANS ANNOUNCED YOUTH PHEASANT HUNT OFFERS MENTOR COMPONENT HARRISBURG - Concerns earlier this year about avian influenza have prompted the Pennsylvania Game Commission to cancel this year's public tours of its four game farms, which are used to raise ring-necked pheasants for small game hunting seasons.
However, in order to continue to provide the public an opportunity to see these operations, Pennsylvania Cable Network (PCN) is planning to rebroadcast its three-part tour of the Game Commission's game farm operation at 1 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 21.
"Earlier this year, the state Department of Agriculture had issued a ban on public exhibitions of live birds as a step to prevent the spread of avian influenza," said Carl F. Riegner, chief of the agency's Propagation Division.
"While the Department has since lifted that ban, we believe it is necessary to cancel this year's tours to protect hunters' investment in this year's stock.
It is our hope that we can conduct these public tours next year."
The tours are designed to provide the public an opportunity to learn more about the Game Commission's game farms and the agency's pheasant propagation program, Riegner said.
He noted that when the agency does conduct tours of the game farms, steps to maintain biosecurity and minimize human contact with the birds are taken.
As part of the PCN Tour, the public will to see the pheasant raising operation from start to finish, including: breeder pens; hatcheries; brooder houses; and rearing and "grow-out" pens.
Please check local listings for the PCN channel in your area.
Each year, the Game Commission's goal is to raise 200,000 ring-necked pheasants at the Game Commission's four game farms to be released on state game lands and properties enrolled in the agency's public access programs.
The pheasant-stocking program provides a tangible product for the license buyer, adds diversity to the hunting experience at a time when wild pheasant populations are low and is a valued service for many sportsmen.
FALL PHEASANT STOCKING PLANS ANNOUNCED
The Pennsylvania Game Commission has slated nearly 193,000 ring-necked pheasants for release throughout the Commonwealth for the upcoming small game hunting seasons.
Birds will be released for the first-ever Youth Pheasant Hunt, which is scheduled for Oct. 12 and 14 (please see following article for details on the Youth Pheasant Hunt).
"Our pheasant breeding program faced two obstacles this year: the wet and cold spring weather killed some pheasant chicks during the brooding phase; and an additional problem with commercially-purchased feed caused mortalities," said Carl F. Riegner, chief of the agency's Propagation Division.
"Despite the setbacks, we were able to recover most of our losses by setting additional eggs, but, unfortunately, we still will fall short of releasing 200,000 birds during the small game hunting seasons."
Opening day of the general small game season is Nov. 2, and closes on Nov. 30.
Pheasants will be stocked for four consecutive weeks in each region starting the week of Oct. 28, prior to the opening day.
Preseason releases will consist of 30 percent of the fall allocation, the first two in-season releases will be 25 percent, and the third in-season release will consist of 20 percent of the fall allocation.
"The best opportunities to bag pheasants still exist on State Game Lands where habitat is managed for pheasants, and where most of the agency-raised birds are released," Riegner said.
"Although wild pheasant populations remain very low, excellent hunting opportunities can be enjoyed with the quality pheasants the Commission is releasing."
During the regular fall season, pheasants will be stocked on State Game Lands, certain properties enrolled in the agency's Cooperative Farm-Game and Safety Zone public access programs, and select state parks and federal lands.
Game Commission regional offices have a publication titled A Guide To Pheasant Releases And More, which identifies State Game Lands, and those state parks and federal lands with suitable habitat that receive pheasant stockings.
The publication also is posted on the Game Commission's website (www.pgc.state.pa.us), and can be viewed by clicking on "Hunting Information," then choosing "PGC's Pheasant Program."
A regional breakdown for the regular season stocking is as follows: Northwest Region, 13,860 males and 20,330 females; Southwest Region, 26,780 males and 14,240 females; Northcentral Region, 3,370 males and 12,650 females; Southcentral Region, 18,650 males and 5,530 females; Northeast Region, 9,160 males and 14,870 females; and Southeast Region 30,220 males and 2,890 females.
Regional allocations are based on the amount of suitable pheasant habitat open to public hunting and pheasant hunting pressure.
This year, the late season is scheduled for Dec. 16-24 and Dec. 26-Feb. 8.
"Pheasant releases for the late season will take place just before the holidays to maximize recreational value for young hunters afield over school holidays, and others who may be on vacation," Riegner said.
A regional breakdown for the late-season hen stocking of 6,600 pheasants is as follows: Northwest Region, 1,000; Southwest Region, 1,600; Northcentral Region, 1,400; Southcentral Region, 1,000; and Northeast Region, 1,600.
For details on the pheasant seasons, please see pages 13-16 of the 2002-2003 Pennsylvania Digest of Hunting

CLUBS STEP FORWARD TO OFFER MENTORED YOUTH PHEASANT HUNTS
More than a dozen sportsmen's clubs have stepped forward to sponsor a mentored hunt as part of the Pennsylvania Game Commission's first-ever youth pheasant season, which will be held concurrently with the annual junior squirrel hunt on Oct. 12 and 14.
As with the youth squirrel hunt, this new youth hunting opportunity is open to junior hunters ages 12 to 16 who have completed a Hunter-Trapper Education course.
There is no requirement to purchase a junior license.
"The future of hunting is directly related to the continuing participation of young Pennsylvanians in our hunting seasons," said Vern Ross, Game Commission executive director.
"While other states are seeing a decline in the number of young hunters, Pennsylvania is fortunate to see its junior license sales increase slightly over the past few years.
I believe that increase can be attributed to the abundance of game throughout our Commonwealth, our state's long and proud hunting heritage and the strength of programs to promote youth hunting.
"One of the keys to promoting youth hunting is the tremendous effort of our hunting clubs.
These groups are the grassroots organizations that sponsor Youth Field Day events and Hunter-Trapper Education courses throughout the year."
In April, the Board of Game Commissioners gave final approval to the new youth pheasant hunting season that aims to expand hunting opportunities for young Pennsylvanians.
Working with the Pennsylvania State Chapter of Pheasants Forever, the Game Commission's Youth Pheasant Hunt Committee prepared a "Mentored Youth Pheasant Hunt Planning Guide" to enable groups to develop and sponsor a mentored youth pheasant hunt program.
"Holding concurrent youth seasons for squirrel and ring-necked pheasants will offer variety to youths who participate in these small game-hunting opportunities," said Lori Richardson, Game Commission Outreach Coordinator and Youth Pheasant Hunt Committee chair.
"The state's long-standing daily bag limit of two pheasants will apply to junior hunters participating in this season.
Additionally, hens remain protected in the male-pheasant-only zones, and juniors may only harvest male pheasants in those designated counties."
The Game Commission will release 13,560 pheasants on land open to public hunting prior to the start of the two-day season.
Hunters, however, are not limited to hunting in only those areas where pheasants have been stocked.
The pheasant stocking locations and pheasant hunting area maps are outlined on pages 14-16 of the 2002-2003 Pennsylvania Digest of Hunting and Trapping Regulations, as well as on the agency's website (www.pgc.state.pa.us).

Other recent Game Commission initiatives to promote youth hunting opportunities include youth squirrel and waterfowl hunts initiated in 1996; special antlerless deer harvesting opportunities initiated in 1998, and expanded in 2000; and youth field days implemented in the early 1990s.
Also, as part of the license fee increase approved in 1998, the General Assembly created a junior combination license that packages regular license privileges with archery, flintlock and furtaking opportunities for $9, compared to the regular junior license price of $6.
