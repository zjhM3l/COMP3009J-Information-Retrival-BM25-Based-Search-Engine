Following is the text of the fact sheet: (begin text) U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BUREAU FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR) OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA) KOSOVO CRISIS Factsheet #46 May 7, 1999 Past fact sheets can be obtained from the USAID web site at: www.info.usaid.gov/humresponse/ofda/situation.html Regional: Refugees/Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Kosovo Albania Total Refugees 406,000 Entries in last 24 hrs 650 Departures in last 24 hrs None Macedonia Total Refugees 230,900 Entries in last 24 hrs None Departures in last 24 hrs 1,736 Montenegro Total Refugees 61,700 Entries in last 24 hrs None Departures in last 24 hrs None (All numbers are estimates from United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) Headquarters.
These numbers are constantly changing and being verified.)
--Food for Peace (FFP) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) met with PVO implementing partners yesterday to discuss the current status of food assistance programs in Albania and Macedonia, and to present plans to pre-position Title II and 416(b) commodities in the region.
FFP and USDA will maintain contingency stocks of approximately 14,000 metric tons (MT) of wheat flour, rice, vegetable oil and beans in the region, while moving another projected 14,000 MTs per month through World Food Program (WFP) and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) food assistance programs.
(14,000 MTs represents a one-month supply of 30-day rations for over 750,000 people).
Possible locations for U.S. Government contingency stocks include Skopje, Thessaloniki, Sofia, and Burgas.
Title II commodities for the contingency stocks have been identified and shipment will begin next week.
ALBANIA --UNHCR headquarters estimates that there are 406,000 refugees in Albania.
Approximately 650 refugees from Kosovo over the last 24 hours.
Of the total number of refugees in Albania, 102,727 are in the three northern border districts of Kukes, Has and Tropje.
--The Government of Albania's (GOA) Emergency Management Group estimates that 4,700 refugees were transferred from the Kukes area to other regions of Albania during the last 24 hours.
The cumulative number of refugees transferred out of Kukes since March 24 totals 314,000.
--Security at refugee camps in Kukes and Korce is still a priority.
Since the German government withdrew from the Korce camp, the NGOs who have taken over camp management have been unable to maintain a presence at night due to insecurity.
The Western European Union and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are reportedly developing a plan to deploy more camp police throughout Albanian refugee camps.
--The acceleration of the Camp Hope construction timeline is underway.
The contractor continues to mobilize additional labor and equipment to complete the camp by May 25.
Tents are being erected now and will have the ability to accommodate 2,500 refugees by May 12.
Essential camp infrastructure (potable water and latrines) will not be completed before May 12.
--WFP reports that it is providing food to 95,000 refugees who reside with host families.
Food is also provided to the host families themselves.
--Artillery fire from Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) forces was reported in the villages of Letaj and Pogaj in Has District on May 6.
--On May 11, the GOA will provide to UNHCR a list of available military structures that may be used to house refugees.
--WFP's sub-office in Korce reported the arrival of 5,000 refugees from Macedonia, 6 May.
WFP is assessing the possibility of new bakery arrangements in Korce in anticipation of the continued influx of refugees from Macedonia.
--WFP reports that it has provided over 200 MTs of wheat flour to the Red Cross Movement for its distributions to host families and refugees in host families.
The inadequacy of the current Red Cross commodity pipeline, together with the limited capacity of the Albanian Red Cross, continues to be of concern.
--The International Committee of the Red Cross/International Federation of the Red Cross (ICRC/IFRC) reports that over the past week the Red Cross Movement has distributed over 600 MT of food parcels and wheat flour throughout Albania.
However, the IFRC cautions that its supplies may prove inadequate for the growing number of refugees in host families and the host families themselves.
The most recent Red Cross figures indicate that there are currently 267,513 refugees being hosted in 42,074 families.
--WFP has assessed the small port of Shejin (north of Durres) and believes it can support shipments up to 1000 MTs. WFP will use this port to supply the bakery in Shkoder with flour.
Macedonia --UNHCR headquarters estimates that there are currently 230,900 refugees in Macedonia (UNHCR/Skopje reports 238,600).
This number is revised from yesterday's figure, despite the fact that there were no official refugee entries, because for the first time, UNHCR is including refugee estimates from the Government of Macedonia's (GOM) Ministry of Interior.
On May 5, 1,736 refugees departed Macedonia for third countries.
--UNHCR reports that scattered groups of some 770 refugees entered Macedonia through Straza on May 6.
The refugees avoided Macedonian border police as they were led by Albanian villagers, and were accommodated by residents of Lojane and Slupcane.
Refugees requiring medical attention were brought to a local hospital by UNHCR.
--According to a May 6 UNHCR press release, UNHCR has received renewed assurances from the GOM that it will allow refugees from Kosovo to cross the border into Macedonia.
During a meeting in Skopje Thursday, Macedonia's Interior Minister told the UNHCR representative that the border would remain open.
UNHCR said it welcomed the verbal assurances from the government and hoped that this would quickly translate into action on the ground.
--On May 6, 2,000 - 4,000 refugees were waiting at the border of Maceodnia on the Serbian side, and a train which arrived at the border was turned back.
The GOM reports that if refugees are not able to cross the border, the blockage is coming from the Serbian site.
UNHCR and the GOM report today that the border is open but that there are no refugees waiting to cross.
--UNHCR's latest report indicates that there are 103,200 refugees in camps in Macedonia, 112,613 refugees registered by the Macedonian Red Cross in host families (latest figure from UNHCR/Skopje -- as of 4 May), 107,432 registered by Macedonian authorities for refugee status and staying in host families or private accommodations (latest figure reported by UNHCR/Skopje -- as of 5 May), and 4,790 are gathered in border communities (Straza, Vaksince, Kumanovo, Lipkovo, and Slupcane).
--416 refugees are due to arrive at Fort Dix, New Jersey today.
The next scheduled arrivals are on the 10th, 12th, and 13th of May.

The police reportedly burned homes and killed dozens of ethnic Albanians in these raids.
Thousands of ethnic Albanians in Pristina protested Serb police actions, and were subsequently attacked by the police with tear gas, water cannons, and clubs.
--As a result of the fighting, thousands of Kosovar Albanians were displaced from their homes, many taking refuge with host families, while a smaller proportion (several thousand) took to the hills and forests.
