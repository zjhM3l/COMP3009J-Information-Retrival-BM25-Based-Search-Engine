Route 22 Gets $55 Million in Transportation Bill
WASHINGTON, May 22, 1998 -- The transportation authorization passed by Congress today includes funds for projects that are essential to the economic progress of Pennsylvania's 12^th District, U.S. Rep. John Murtha announced today.
Inserted into the legislation at Murtha's request were $50 million for unspecified work on Route 22 plus $4.9 million toward a four-lane Route 22 over Chickoree Mountain from the Cambria-Indiana border to Jackson Township.
"Route 22 needs to be upgraded through Cambria, Indiana and Westmoreland Counties because it's such a key corridor to Pittsburgh and essential for our continued job-development efforts," Murtha said.
"So we're taking several big steps in our ongoing efforts to rebuild our regional economic and job base."
Murtha noted that the final link of Route 22 from the Cambria-Indiana county line to the end of the current four-lane near Mundys Corner previously had not been included in the state Department of Transportation's plans, while all of the work had been under-funded.

Route 219 Gets $7.4 Million in Transportation Bill
WASHINGTON, May 22, 1998 -- The transportation authorization passed by Congress today includes $7.4 million for continuing the progress on Route 219 in Somerset County, U.S. Rep. John Murtha announced today.
In addition, the legislation provides a major increase in funding the Appalachian Regional Highway System, which includes this part of Route 219.
Murtha said he expects the $7.4 million to be enough to complete all the planning and environmental work on the section from Somerset to Meyersdale, where a bypass is currently under construction.
In addition, he noted, the legislation includes a major increase in funding for the Appalachian Regional Highway System, which as designated two decades ago includes Route 219 through Somerset County to Interstate 68.
Assuming the project advances through the studies in a timely manner, this part of Route 219 would be well positioned to compete for Appalachian money.
Murtha said, "The job-development potential in all of Somerset County will be advanced tremendously with this project, which will leave just one shorter link to finish from Meyersdale to Interstate 68.
Linking major highways to major highways is the name of the game, and this is another important step in the process of creating a link from Route 22 the whole way to I-68."

Fayette Projects Inserted in Transportation Bill
WASHINGTON, May 22, 1998 -- The transportation authorization passed by Congress today includes funds for projects that are essential to the economic progress of Fayette County and the Fay-West area, U.S. Rep. John Murtha announced today.
Inserted into the legislation at Murtha's request were: * $20 million toward the Mon-Fayette Expressway work between Uniontown and Brownsville.
* $6.9 million toward the upgrading and reconstruction of the Route 819-Route 119 Interchange in the Mount Pleasant Scottdale area.
"These projects are priorities for regional job development," Murtha said.
"So we're taking some big steps in our ongoing efforts to rebuild our regional economic and job base."
Murtha said Congressman Frank Mascara, a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, had taken the lead in seeking the $20 million toward the Mon-Fayette Expressway project.
"That's the key project for central Fayette County, and I was pleased to work with Congressman Mascara to support his push for this essential funding.
As a member of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Mascara took the lead on this project and did an outstanding job," Murtha said.
"Our success in attracting Sony and its 2,400 jobs has been a key factor in turning around the Fay-West economy, and that economic recovery has brought about additional job- and housing-development opportunities along Route 819," Murtha said of the interchange project.
"In order to capitalize on these opportunities and continue our rebuilding, we need to increase the capacity of this interchange."

Cambria Job-Development Roads Inserted in Transportation Bill
WASHINGTON, May 22, 1998 -- The transportation authorization passed by Congress today includes two key job-development projects for Cambria County, U.S. Rep. John Murtha announced today.
Inserted into the legislation at Murtha's request were:
* $3.1 million toward construction of the Hastings Industrial Park Access Road and improvements to the Number Nine Road in the vicinity of the industrial park. * $0.8 million toward the relocation of the Airport Road near the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport to make prime land available for job-development.
"These projects are priorities for regional job development," Murtha said.
"So we're taking several big steps in our ongoing efforts to rebuild our regional economic and job base."
Murtha said the competitiveness of companies in the Hastings Industrial Park will improve and the chances of attracting new companies with new jobs to the site will be enhanced a lot by the new industrial park access road along.
The project also will upgrade the Number Nine Road, the main connector from Northern Cambria Borough to Hastings, which will provide much better connections from Hastings and the new Industrial Park Access Road to Route 219 near Carrolltown.
He said the relocation of the Airport Road would make room for additional development adjacent to the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport.

Route 119 Project Inserted in Transportation Bill
WASHINGTON, May 22, 1998 -- The transportation authorization passed by Congress today includes $3.1 million to jump start construction of improvements to Route 119 between Indiana and Homer City.
"The top priorities for economic development in Indiana County are improving Route 22 toward Pittsburgh and improving Route 119 to provide better access to Route 22," Murtha said.
"This legislation includes $55 million for upgrading Route 22 in addition to the Route 119 funding.
"We're continuing the progress toward four-lane access the whole way from central Indiana County to Pittsburgh," Murtha said.
Record Employment Proves Process Works
JOHNSTOWN, November 10, 1997 -- The local area's record level of employment is "proof positive that our step-by-step approach to economic development is working," U.S. Rep. John Murtha told the local Economic Summit today.
"In August, there were 101,800 people with jobs in the Cambria-Somerset market area," Murtha said.
"That's an all-time record job level, that's nearly 20,000 more people working today compared with 1983, and that's remarkable when you think back on how devastated the area was from the loss of coal and steel jobs over the rears."
Murtha said there are many reasons for the progress, but he's been most impressed by how one thing builds upon another.
For instance:
* He obtained $6 million to leverage construction of a new interchange and access road for the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport.
As a result, JARI filled up the industrial park and started a new industrial park, which already has business, and the Galleria and surrounding shopping areas were developed.
The Galleria and adjacent commercial areas created thousands of additional jobs, and also make the area more attractive to companies considering moving here because shopping is a key component of quality of life.
* As part of Murtha's effort to decentralize the government and take advantage of improved modern communications techniques, he attracted the National Drug Intelligence Center, federal centers that became Concurrent Technologies Corporation and grants to help area businesses compete for government contracts.
As a result, several companies moved here to provide services to these installations; other businesses were created or moved here because of the technical expertise; and many existing businesses expanded with a new customer base.
* Murtha attracted major federal investments in the Allegheny-Portage Railroad National Historic Landmark, the Johnstown Flood National Memorial, the Johnstown Flood Museum, the Inclined Plane, the Ghost Town and Allegheny Highlands trails, and other tourism facilities.
Spending by the visitors, the facilities and their employees has major direct and spin-off impacts throughout the area economy.
As a result, we've also seen millions of dollars of investment and new jobs created in construction and lodging.
These investments and jobs include new motels at Ebensburg, Richland Township, downtown Johnstown and Somerset; major renovations of hotels in downtown Johnstown and Richland; and development of about 10 bed and breakfast facilities.
Some simpler examples of how one thing builds on another include:
* The new Joint Aviation Facility that Murtha attracted to the Johnstown area needed sewer service -- and so did the Frankstown Road section of Conemaugh Township.
Details were worked out to run the helicopter facility's sewage through the township and take care of both problems at once.Murtha attracted major federal investments in the Allegheny-Portage Railroad National Historic Landmark, the Johnstown Flood National Memorial, the Johnstown Flood Museum, the Inclined Plane, the Ghost Town and Allegheny Highlands trails, and other tourism facilities.

These investments and jobs include new motels at Ebensburg, Richland Township, downtown Johnstown and Somerset; major renovations of hotels in downtown Johnstown and Richland; and development of about 10 bed and breakfast facilities.
* NORCAM (Northern Cambria Economic Development Corp.) convinced Inland Steel Coal Co. to donate two buildings for economic development.
Federal and state grants provided sewer and water.
As a result, a new company called Aerofab, Inc., was created and attracted to the site.
Aerofab went to work with the JARI Defense Procurement Assistance Center and created 12 jobs with $807,000 in defense contracts.
Murtha used two aerial photographs of the Richland Township area to show the audience the tremendous development that's been generated by all of the activity that built from that first step -- the interchange-access road.
Murtha said the region is poised to continue its progress because many areas that previously were closed to development are being opened by new sewer and water infrastructure, by improvements at the Airport and on area highways.
Sewer and water project that Murtha helped to fund include the South Fork sewer project that will open the area along Route 219 from the Galleria and Airport north past South Fork, $28 million; Pegasus sewer project opening Conemaugh Township from the Airport down Frankstown Road, $2.6 million; West Branch Sewer project, opening Barnesboro-Spangler area, $17 million; Spangler water project, $4.1 million; Blacklick Valley water project opening the Vintondale area, $2.3 million; Onnalinda-Adams Township water project, $500,000; Loretto Prison project opening Loretto Borough, $1.7 million; Jenners sewage expansion, $2.5 million; Central City water project, $1 million.
Murtha also noted that the $78 million Route 219 Meyersdale Bypass is in construction; the $35 million Route 219 Ebensburg Bypass was opened six years ago; work on the needs assessment for Route 219 from Carrolltown to DuBois is about to resume; work on the needs assessment for Route 219 from Somerset into Maryland is about to resume; $64 million worth of improvements are completed on Route 22 west toward Pittsburgh; another $260 million worth of improvements have been put back into PennDOT's 12-year plan; key sections of Route 56 have been rebuilt or improved at a cost exceeding $40 million; and additional plans are being developed for Route 56 improvements toward Bedford and in Johnstown's West End.
He said he's proud of the role he's played in saving 2,000 steel jobs, promoting the defense contracting that created over 1,100 new jobs and sustained 4,000 more, advancing tourism that supports 6,500 jobs, and bringing in federal installations that directly employ more than 1,200 people, all in the Cambria-Somerset market area.
"We're working all the time on job development, and we're certainly aware of these direct impacts," he said.
"But I'm amazed when I look at the spin-offs and how one thing leads to another in building toward the future.
It's all added up to record employment for the area."

National Farmers Union Recognizes Murtha
September 10, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha was recognized this week by the National Farmers Union (NFU) as having an excellent voting record on Farmers Union issues during the 1996 session of Congress.
"In our rural communities in Indiana and Armstrong (localize by adjacent counties) Counties, I've seen how vital farming is as a centerpiece of the economy and a pillar of community character and family values," Murtha said.
"Our farmers work hard and they deserve the support of our government."
The Farmers Union evaluated members of Congress on 15 votes key to the organization's political positions.
The NFU recognized members who voted in favor of rural America on issues such as initiatives to improve the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act, health care, safe drinking water, pesticide regulation, food safety, welfare reform and education.
"We appreciate the support of congressional leaders who value rural America and the important part it plays in weaving the social and economic fabric of our country," NFU President Leland Swenson said.
Farmers Union members from throughout the country traveled to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the Clinton administration about on-going issues.
Bob Junk of Somerset presented the NFU's award to Murtha.
NFU is a general farm organization representing nearly 300,000 family farmers and ranchers nationwide.
NFU serves its membership by assisting with education, by providing stimulus and know-how for farmer-owned cooperatives, and by presenting the organization's policies to legislators.

Murtha Visits Businesses on Community Day
SCOTTDALE, August 22, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today held a community day here to meet with local residents and businesses, and hear first hand about their concerns and priorities.
"I work hard at staying in touch, and try to make it easy for people to reach me through a toll-free phone number, regular staff outreach and even e-mail and a web page," Murtha said.
"But I really enjoy coming out and spending a big part of the day visiting in a particular community to better understand the vision of the people in terms of where they see their community going and what their priorities are."
Murtha began the day by having breakfast with about 70 people -- a cross section of community leaders, elected officials, business owners and others.
Then he toured Kenco Fabricating Co., on Scottdale R.D. 1, which manufactures emergency vehicles, bomb-containment disposal vessels and other equipment.
Murtha had lunch with officials and employees of Duraloy Technologies, Inc., at 120 Bridge St., which makes high alloy castings and assemblies for heat- and corrosion-resistant applications.
"Our work in attracting jobs at Sony, American Video Glass, United Defense and Fay-Penn Fiber get periodic media attention, but retaining the jobs we already have is also enormously important," Murtha said.
"So I make a point of trying to visit with companies to see how business is going and see if we can help in any way."
After lunch, Murtha looked over one of the region's premier tourist sites, West Overton Museums, the birthplace of industrialist Henry Clay Frick and one of the nation's few in-tact villages that pre-date the Civil War.
"Tourism has been one of our success stories in terms of economic diversification, but it's also been a source of rebuilding community pride and improving quality of life," he said.
A 1993 study by Pennsylvania State University for the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission concluded that travel and tourism contributed over $123 million in total sales and 3,561 jobs in Westmoreland County, plus over $56 million in sales and 1,382 jobs in Fayette County.

Murtha Joins Indiana Officials In Groundbreaking
BLAIRSVILLE, August 21, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today joined with Indiana County elected and economic-development officials in breaking ground on the Corporate Campus, an industrial park expected to attract or create up to 250 jobs near here.
"Located at the intersection of Route 22 and Route 119, a short distance from both the Latrobe and Indiana airports, the Corporate Campus has strong potential for job development, and that's why we've been able to attract funds from several federal programs," said Murtha.
He noted that a $1.75 million sewerage project to be built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will provide essential sewerage to three parts of Burrell Township, including the Corporate Campus.
A $900,000 grant from the Economic Development Administration and Appalachian Regional Commission will help to build the internal infrastructure of the Corporate Campus.
The Commission also provided a second grant of $350,000 to cover part of the cost of building a structure to house a Small Business Incubator and an "Innovation Center" that will draw on the expertise of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Murtha said, noting that this facility will support 76 jobs.
Combined, the three federal grants total $3 million.
In addition, $336,700 is committed from the State Industrial Development Authority and $613,000 is committed in bank and utility loans to the county for the building.
"Economic development doesn't just happen.
It takes a lot of effort by a lot of people, who work step-by-step toward progress.
I'm proud to be able to help move these projects forward, but I certainly want to commend the County Commissioners, the state legislators, the County Planning Office, the Burrell Township officials, the Corps of Engineers and everybody else who's played a role in helping to bring job development to our community," Murtha said.

Murtha Dedicates Runway, Defense Aviation Facility
JOHNSTOWN, August 18, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today joined officials of the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport Authority, the U.S. Army Reserves and the Pennsylvania National Guard in dedicating several new facilities at the local airport.
"The planning for all this started about 10 years ago, and it's been like a marathon hurdle race -- clearing one hurdle after another after another," said Murtha.
"But when you look at how far we've come, when you realize that we're on the verge of having a totally rebuilt airport that should help attract business to the region, and when you realize we'll have about 200 direct full-time military jobs here at the airport, it's clear that we have a lot to celebrate today."
Murtha joined officials of the Airport Authority in cutting a ribbon to officially open the completely rebuilt and extended main runway, a $16.7 million project carried out in several phases dating back to 1990.
The runway was extended 1,500 feet and now is 7,000 feet long.
A half-hour later, he joined officials of the Army Reserves and the Pennsylvania National Guard in cutting a ribbon on their portion of the Joint Aviation Facility, which cost about $26 million when sewage extensions, engineering and design costs are added to the $20.4 million direct construction price carried out with an appropriation that passed Congress in 1991.
"We've come a long, long way -- and we're a long way from being done," said Murtha.
"In the next year or two we'll see an expansion and rehabilitation of the commercial terminal building, construction of a new air traffic control tower and construction of a major addition to the military facility that will double the number of personnel working here.
So we'll soon have an airport facility that's among the best in the world for a community the size of Greater Johnstown -- making this airport a real asset as we work to attract more jobs to the area."
Airport Manager Joseph McKelvey said the improvements on the commercial side of the airport were a key in attracting Capital Airlines, Inc., to develop plans to establish direct commercial flights service to the East.
Murtha said the commercial facility should have significant economic impact to the local economy over the long term, but the defense facility has significant impact right now.
"We've got about 115 full-time personnel assigned here now with the Army Reserves and the National Guard, and when the Marine Corps expansion is added, we'll have almost 230 full-timers here, along with several hundred Reserve and Guard personnel training here once a month.
That represents a significant direct economic benefit to the local economy," Murtha said.
He noted that arranging to bring the Pennsylvania National Guard's 258th Air Traffic Control Squadron to Johnstown was a benefit not only for the military but also for the commercial side of the airport.
Without it, the Johnstown airport would qualify only for weather observation personnel, not air traffic control service.
"So the military presence here has a direct and major impact in making the commercial operation here among the best in the national for a community of this size," Murtha said.
He expressed his appreciation to everyone involved in the projects on both the military and civilian sides of the airport.

Murtha Statement Highlights Route 22 Progress
Aug. 14, 1997 -- Congressman Murtha today issued the following statement on Route 22 in response to a media inquiry.
"Route 22 has long been a priority of mine because it's such an important corridor for business and job-retention, not only in Johnstown and Central Cambria but also in Indiana and northern Westmoreland Counties.
That's why I worked to obtain $30 million in special federal appropriations to advance the work on this corridor, and that $30 million has leveraged over $64 million worth of work when the state's funding is included.
"In addition to the $64 million of work done in the past few years, PennDOT has over $260 million programmed in the 12-year plan to continue the widening of Route 22 into a 4-lane highway connecting our region to the Pittsburgh area and other markets west of here.
PennDOT's philosophy is that, because everybody along the corridor benefits from improvements on the western end, near Pittsburgh, they're starting on that end and working toward the east.
"So they've completed $54 million worth of Work on Route 22 in Westmoreland County and have $165 million worth of work in the 12-year plan -- most of it in the first four years.
They've got $10 million of work under way right now in Indiana County, with nearly $100 million included in the plan -- most of it again in the first four years.
There's only four miles of Route 22 that they haven't been able to fit into the available funding -- and that's the last segment heading east from the Indiana County line to Mundy's Corner.
"I'd certainly like to get this section of Route 22 put back in the 12-year plan, too, and I'll continue to work with PennDOT and people in the Jackson Township area to try to work that out.
Meanwhile, I'll continue to encourage PennDOT to work toward some short-term safety improvements in that area.
But anyone who says that we haven't succeeded in convincing PennDOT that Route 22 is a priority just hasn't looked at the $328 million of improvements that have been completed or are now put back in the plan."

Murtha Tours Anchor Glass Plant
SOUTH CONNELLSVILLE, July 1, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today toured the Anchor Glass Container plant to personally thank the new owners and managers for their confidence in the area and to offer his continued assistance in helping the company sustain and hopefully restore jobs.
"This five-year Rolling Rock contract was seen as an absolute necessity for the survival of Anchor Glass here in South Connellsville," Murtha said.
"With that contract now in hand, I look forward to continuing to work with the owners, management, labor, and the community at large to do whatever we can to position this facility to be competitive in the long haul."
The Anchor plant was for sale and its former owner in bankruptcy when the Connellsville plant's contract with Beech-Nut came up for renewal and was lost to a competitor, resulting in nearly 200 workers being furloughed.
Since then, the company was bought by Consumers Packaging Inc. of Toronto, Canada, and the plant was successful in renewing its contract with Latrobe Brewing.
"Obviously, the jobs that remain here at Anchor are essential for our area's economic stability.
So I want to thank the new plant owners, as well as the workers and management for all their efforts win the renewal of the Rolling Rock Contract.
I'll continue to do everything I can to help them to further stabilize and hopefully restore jobs at this facility."

Ground Breaking for Kittanning Riverfront Park
KITTANNING, June 14, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today joined the Kittanning Riverfront Commission and community leaders in a ground breaking ceremony for the $4.35 million Kittanning Riverfront Park.
Murtha also joined the Riverfront Commission in announcing the development of the Downtown Kittanning Low Interest Loan Program, in which five local financial institutions have pledged a $1 million pool for low interest loans for downtown Kittanning revitalization.
"The riverfront will be a tremendous attraction to Central Armstrong County, so it will have significant direct economic impact," Murtha said.
"The park will also be a major focus of community activity that enhances the quality of life in our area, which not only benefits the people who live in the area, but also helps with our broader mission of attracting new jobs to the region."
The park is being built with a $4.35 million Special Purpose Grant that Murtha got through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The federal funds are leveraging additional major investment in the Kittanning business district and other community improvements, such as the $1.1 million Jacob Street Storm Sewer Diversion project.
The project includes construction of an amphitheater, gazebos, a boat launch area, restrooms, a pathway along the river, landscaping and a visitors center.
Project Manager Ronald Gdovic said, "The ripple effects of this project have already been felt.
Several properties that sat idle for years were purchased and new businesses were established along the riverfront.
I have fielded inquiries from businesses in Butler and Pittsburgh who are keeping a watchful eye on the developments in Kittanning and have expressed an interest in now vacant downtown storefronts."
Gdovic said the loan program would carry an interest rate two points below national prime for commercial businesses in the Borough, not just Market Street.
Participating lenders are S

Federal Funds Support Terminal Expansion 
JOHNSTOWN, April 25, 1997 -- A $1 million grant to the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport Authority for a major expansion and rehabilitation of the local airport terminal building was announced today by U.S. Rep. John Murtha.
"The Airport is obviously a major factor in our ability to attract and keep jobs in the area," Murtha said.
"This terminal building project builds on all the work we've been doing in the past few years to lengthen the runway and develop a major defense aviation facility, but will be the most obvious improvement to local air travelers."
The $1 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration will be combined with local passenger facility charges and state funds for a $1.8 million project, according to Joseph McKelvey, airport manager.
The project will double the size of the terminal building.
All passenger facilities, including the arrival and departure lounges, security screening area, and the baggage and ticket counter area, will be expanded and rehabilitated.
"The project will enhance the airport development and enable us to meet the passengers' needs and demands over the next 10 years," McKelvey said.

Agriculture Department 
Murtha Announce $5.3 Million Shannock Valley Sewerage Award
RURAL VALLEY, April 22, 1997 -- A $5.3 million award to the Shannock Valley General Services Authority for a major sewerage project was announced today by Jill Long Thompson, the Under Secretary for Rural Development in the U.S. Department of Agriculture; Cheryl L. Cook, State Director for Rural Development in Pennsylvania; and U.S. Rep. John Murtha.
The project entails construction of a waste-water collection and treatment system for Rural Valley Borough and the Villages of Yatesboro and Rose Valley in Cowanshannock Township to serve about 1,500 residents.
The system also will service the Shannock Valley Industrial Center, an industrial park where growth has been limited by the size of holding tanks used to temporarily store sewage.
Rural Utilities Service of the USDA is providing a $2,705,000 grant and $2,600,000 loan to combine with a $309,000 contribution from the local authority for a total project cost of $5,614,000.
Cook said, "Shannock Valley's award is part of an Earth Day announcement of over $68 million in water- and sewer-project awards throughout the nation being funded by the USDA, as announced by (Agriculture) Secretary Dan Glickman on Earth Day, April 22, 1997, in Washington, DC."
Thompson said, "This is precisely the type of cooperative approach to solving local problems that we need to do in other areas of the country.
Congressman Murtha has been integrally involved in this particular project and made a big difference."
Murtha, who was in Washington for budget meetings, in a statement noted that this project was too big to be funded out of Pennsylvania's regular allocation for sewer and water projects, adding, "I want to express my appreciation to the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, and Under Secretary Thompson because, when we explained the situation -- the state mandates, the need for jobs, and this beautiful, close-knit community of people with strong traditional values -- they were able to find some extra money in a national pool that will enable this project to finally move forward."
Authority Chairman Lee Calarie noted that efforts to build a sewer system in the area date back to 1962, but that the project never happened because of the high construction costs and low average incomes.
"It's appropriate that on Earth Day we stand here in the Shannock Valley Community Park, where families and children who gather and play have had to stay away from the creek because it's polluted with raw sewage," Calarie said.
"So on behalf of the community, I want to thank Congressman Murtha and the Department of Agriculture for making this project finally happen.
It's essential to the future of Shannock Valley."
Funding is being provided through Rural Utilities Service, which is one of three agencies in the USDA's Rural Development Mission Area.
This year, Pennsylvania's share of the annual allocation for the RUS's nationwide water and waste-disposal programs totals approximately $52 million.

Dunbar Sewer Project Funding Is Approved
DUNBAR, April 2, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced the approval of more than $6 million in grants and loans to finance the Dunbar Borough Sanitary Authority's plan to upgrade and expand its sewer system.
"Without this project, there can be no job development and no residential development in Dunbar," Murtha said.
"So this is a critical step in the economic rebuilding of Fayette County."
The project includes construction of a treatment plant and extending of collection lines to service Dunbar Borough and the nearby areas known as Pechins, Furnace Hill and Hardy Hill.
The federal funding, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development section, includes a grant of $2,204,000 and a low-interest loan of $3,885,000.
The loan has a 40-year repayment term at 4.5% interest.
"The survival of Dunbar and all of Fayette County hinges on our ability to attract new jobs and people to the area," Murtha said.
"The state insisted that Dunbar needs to clean up its sewage, which now runs down the stream and into the Youghiogheny River just above Connellsville, where the riverfront park, the trail and boating have become a real economic generator for the area."
Murtha added, "We worked hard to make sure Rural Development understood not only the importance of this project but also the need to make it as affordable as possible.
The percentage of this project that's a grant is unusually high, and that was key to holding tap-in fees to only $500 per residence, which compares with normal tap-in fees of at least $1,000 and up to $1,500," Murtha said.

Murtha Honored for Backing Industrial Energy Needs
WASHINGTON, February 24, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha will receive an award from the American Iron 
Tuesday during the Second Industrial Energy Efficiency Symposium and Expo.
The Symposium is being held at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City.
Murtha is being honored for his support of the Metals Initiative, a government-industry collaborative program designed to improve the competitiveness of the steel and other metal industries, such as aluminum.
"Through the Voluntary Restraint Agreements and similar measures that I fought for, we've brought America's steel industry from the brink of collapse into a modern, globally competitive position," said Murtha, who has served in a leadership role on the Congressional Steel Caucus.
"But we can't rest on our laurels -- we need to keep working to sustain the competitiveness of our steel industry and other metals industries because so many American jobs and the strength of the US economy hang in the balance."
The Metals Initiative has received $120 million in appropriations over the past decade to develop direct steelmaking, advanced process controls and now an optical sensor for measuring temperatures.
"The metals industry is extremely energy intensive, but the R
"So with a fairly small yearly investment of the government we've been able to get the various companies to work together in a collaborative effort that's really making a tremendous payback in the paychecks and corporate taxes of a stronger industry."
Murtha will receive the award from C.H. Barnette, Chairman of Bethlehem Steel Corp., who said Murtha's leadership on the House Appropriations Committee has been essential for this program's origination and continued success.

EPA Releases Grant for South Buffalo Water Project
WASHINGTON, February 3, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced the official release of a $3.5 million grant to help upgrade the water system in parts of South Buffalo and North Buffalo Townships.
"This water project is essential for us to proceed with the Slate Lick Industrial Park, so it's a key step in our continuing job-development efforts for Armstrong County," Murtha said.
The project also will provide water service for many South Buffalo Township residents who rely on wells and other sources of water, he said.
Testing of wells in the area has shown high levels of contamination from iron, magnesium and on-lot septic systems.
The Congressman noted that the County has an option to buy 800 acres for the industrial park, which will be situated just off the Slate Lick Exit of the Allegheny Valley Expressway (Route 28).
Most of the park will be in South Buffalo Township and about 20 acres in North Buffalo Township.
"Because of the great access to Pittsburgh, local officials have already had some inquiries from companies interested in that site," Murtha said.
"So this is indeed good news for our area."
Richard Palilla of the county Planning Office said the county plans to exercise the option to buy the land and to design the industrial park this year.
Murtha added, "We worked hard to continue our progress in reducing the deficit while at the same time recognizing the fact that, in rural areas like ours, communities need financial help to build the sewerage and water systems that are needed for job development.
I'm very pleased that I could convince Congress how important water is to the future of Armstrong County."

Legislators Look at Job Progress, Eye More
BLAIRSVILLE, January 30, 1997 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha joined the state legislative team from Indiana County today in touring three growing industries and met with the Chamber of Commerce as they explored ways to continue the progress.
Murtha headed a team of State Sen. Patrick Stapleton, state Rep. Sara Steelman and state Rep. Tim Pesci in touring Gorell Enterprises, Inc., in Indiana, and Clark Metal Products, Inc. and Dlubak Corp., both of Blairsville.
"Between them, these companies have created over 275 jobs over the past several years," said Murtha.
"We're visiting these companies today and meeting with the Chamber as part of our effort to stay in touch with the business community.
The goal is to understand their concerns and make sure we continue to work together as the area's business and political leaders to keep business and jobs growing in Indiana County."
Gorell Enterprises, created two years ago, purchased the former Season-All plant in Indiana with assistance from several state and federal programs.
The company has grown to over 185 employees in that time, with sales of over $12 million in 1996, according to company President Wayne Gorell.
Gorell said the company projects continued growth in the coming year.
Clark Metal Products has been in business for 43 years, but adopted a growth strategy about eight years ago when Jack and Dave Clark took over the business from their father.
In the past eight years, the company has grown from about 50 employees to 105 workers.
The company manufactures metal enclosures for medical and electronics equipment, including computers.
Dlubak Organic Coatings was developed by Frank Dlubak about two years ago to manufacture ballistics glass and hurricane and earthquake glass.
The company grew to 40 workers, and now Dlubak has combined the Blairsville company with a high-tech glass-bending company in Armstrong County under the name Dlubak Corp. at Blairsville, where total employment is about 120 people.
Mr. Dlubak said he projects continued grow that will enable the company to hire 20 or 30 people in the coming year.
"We're seeing growth at these businesses, development of industrial parks in Indiana and Blairsville, a new prison on the horizon, so the economy here is clearly turning the corner and heading back up," said Murtha.
"But we're not resting on our laurels and that's why we're out here gathering ideas and suggestions from these companies and the county's business leaders."
Murtha noted that, last year, Congress passed a legislative package to help small businesses grow.
That package included an increase in the amount that can be deducted for new equipment, incentives to provide individual retirement accounts for employees who otherwise would accrue no pension benefits, and tax credits for hiring people who are on welfare or other similar programs.

Murtha: National Guard Move Key to Economic Future
JOHNSTOWN, December 23, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha hailed today's announcement about the move of 114th Air Traffic Control Flight as a key to regional growth in the Cambria-Somerset area.
"We worked hard over the past nine months to bring the 114th to Johnstown from State College, and the effort has paid off," Murtha said.
"I want to thank Governor Ridge, General Mac Vay, the National Guard, the local Airport Authority and the County Commissioners for working with us to facilitate this move."
Murtha said the announcement by State Adjutant General James W. Mac Vay noted that the 114th will bring 14 direct, full-time jobs to the Johnstown airport.
However, he emphasized that the total number of direct jobs at the new aviation armory is expected to reach 100 and the real economic impact of the 114th will be felt through the regional economy.
"Transportation is a key issue in economic development, and the capabilities of the local airport can be critical to an attempt to bring a business with private-sector jobs to town," he said.
"Without the 114th Air Traffic Control Flight, it would have been very difficult for the community to maintain full tower service at the Johnstown Airport.
But with the Air unit in place and a new flight tower, Johnstown will have one of the premier airports for a smaller city in this part of the country, and that could be a real asset for future job-development efforts across our area."
Murtha began working to bring the 114th to Johnstown early last year after the Federal Aviation Administration told the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport Authority that the FAA would no long pay part of the cost of tower service.
Under the FAA plan, the Johnstown Airport would have had only a weather-observation post, no personnel to assist with aircraft landing or taking off.
In October, he succeeded in having language put in the Defense Appropriation Bill to make sure funding is available to construct a new flight-control tower for the Guard.
"The Air National Guard has determined that Johnstown affords them an excellent location for training, and we certainly knew from the outset that the 114th would be a tremendous benefit for our area," Murtha said.
"This is clearly another win-win situation for everybody involved."

Murtha Statement on Indiana Prison
December 13, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha issued the following statement today after receiving word that contract negotiations for the site of a new prison near Indiana have been concluded.
"Concluding the property sales agreement is certainly a landmark event in the development of this project.
So I want to commend all the people who've worked on this project from Governor Ridge on down to the local Chamber of Commerce and everyone in between.
Opportunities to bring 200 or more jobs to our area don't come too often, so we've all worked as a team.
We'll continue to work closely to address any ongoing concerns about security or other issues, and I'll of course continue to coordinate the extension of the sewerage and water lines to the site through the federal funds we've obtained through the Corps of Engineers."

Murtha Announces Blacklick Valley Water Project
VINTONDALE, November 26, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced that the Blacklick Valley Water Project has been selected for funding under an Army Corps of Engineers pilot project for environmental infrastructure.
"This project is essential to open up the Blacklick Valley for job development, so it's been recommended by area planning and economic-development officials, and I asked the Corps to make it a priority," Murtha said.
The $2.3 million project planned by the Blacklick Valley Municipal Authority will use $1.4 million from the Army Corps of Engineers.
Another $450,000 has been committed from Community Development Block Grant funding, and an application is pending for $431,500 in PennVest funding.
Blacklick Valley Municipal Authority Chairman Michael Pisarcik expressed the authority's appreciation to the Congressman, noting that the project fits in with recent trends toward regionalizing systems, enables the community to comply with pressing state regulations, and is vital to the health and safety of the residents of Belsano, Ragleyville and Vintondale.
In Cambria County, the project will serve Vintondale Borough with 275 customers, and the Blacklick Township villages of Twin Rocks with 228 customers and Belsano with 101 potential customers.
In the neighboring portion of Indiana County, the project also will serve the Ragleyville and Rexis communities.
In Twin Rocks, the existing water system will enhance fire protection, eliminate lead-jointed lines and provide a vital link through the village to allow service to Vintondale.
A proposed transmission main and distribtuion system improvements to the Vintondale system will eliminate the Bracken Reservoir surface source avoid the cost of complying with environmental regulations requiring filtration of surface water.
The authority explored but could not find a suitable ground water source.
In addition, the borough distribution system must be replaced to provide adequate fire protection and reduce water loss.
Service to Belsano will eliminate private wells, which show evidence of fecal coliform contamination and sometimes run dry.
"Water and sewerage are necessary before we can attract new jobs or allow existing companies to expand very much, so this project is an essential step in our ongoing economic rebuilding effort," Murtha said.

Murtha: Commends Teamwork on Job Development
JOHNSTOWN, November 1, 1996 -- The Cambria-Somerset area has more jobs than it's had at any time since 1979, Congressman John Murtha said in congratulating area economic-development and business leaders for working as a team with the elected leaders and government agencies.
"In a community that's lost many basic industry jobs because of international competition, I think we can pat each other on the back here," Murtha said.
"That's because we've replaced those lost coal and steel jobs and, when you compare where we are today versus 1983, we have a net increase of 13,400 jobs in Cambria and Somerset Counties."
The bottom line, he said, is that our economy is dramatically more diverse than ever before.
"Our work's far from over and I certainly won't rest on my laurels.
But clearly we've made enormous strides in saving as many basic industry jobs as possible, attracting new high-tech manufacturing for the defense sector, attracting and expanding key government facilities such as the Drug Center and the prison in Loretto, expanding our colleges, and including tourism as a major component of the jobs base," he said.
"One key to our growth is that I asked you, the leadership of the community, to develop a vision for where we can grow and expand," he added.
"And even when I've been able to attract a government facility to our area, the commitment and hard work by many of you behind the scenes has been essential to keeping things on track.
So I want to take this opportunity to thank you."
The broader jobs base in the region also has enabled the area to benefit from the national economic expansion, stimulated by the low interest rates that have resulted from the 60 percent reduction in the annual deficit brought about by the 1993 economic package.
"I think we'll see continued progress on reducing the deficit.
That, combined with the small-business relief package we passed a couple months ago will help to sustain our economic growth over the coming year," he said.
Murtha said one of the most significant new laws aimed at job creation came out of the White House Conference on Small Business last year, commending the President for recognizing the need to help small businesses grow.
That measure increases the annual deduction businesses can take for new equipment from $17,500 up to $25,000 over the next seven years.
The measure means small businesses will get a quick write-off when they buy new equipment.
The deduction begins increasing next year, when the annual write-off climbs to $18,000.
"The measure that I've personally pushed for several years is the health-insurance deduction for people who are self-employed," Murtha said.
"I've always felt it's unfair that big companies can write off their health-care costs and the little guy can't, and this new law will change that."
Under this legislation, self-employed people will be able to write off an increasing share of their health-care costs each year through 2006.
The current deduction of 30% will rise to 40% in 1997 and then rise 5% a year, eventually reaching 80%.
Murtha said he has also been an advocate of pension reform for small business.
The Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees, or SIMPLE, simplifies the paperwork required for small companies to set up employee individual retirement accounts.
Two other measures that will encourage job growth are the Work Opportunities Tax Credit and S-Corporation Reform.
The tax credit will enable employers to deduct 35% of the first $6,000 in wages paid to people who are on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (formerly Aid to Families With Dependent Children), 18- to 24-year-olds in families receiving food stamps, former felons, vocational-rehabilitation referrals, high-risk youths, summer youth jobs and veterans on food stamps.
S-Corporation reform is aimed at making it easier for small companies to raise capital investment for start-up or expansion.
These companies will be taxed at the same rate as individuals; will be allowed to have up to 75 shareholders instead of being limited to 35 shareholders, and relaxation of certain ownership limits placed on trusts, banks, tax-exempt organizations and retirement plans.
Murtha reminded Chamber members they can find information about business- and economic-development on his World Wide Web site at: http://www.house.gov/murtha/business.htm __________________________________________________________________

Short Line Railroad Central to Job Development
UNIONTOWN, October 31, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today issued the following statement at the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony for the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad:
"We all knew when we starting to work on saving these rail lines three years ago that the project was essential to saving a lot of jobs in Fayette and Westmoreland County, including a lot of jobs in wood and lumber.
And we all had hopes that the rail service would help us attract new jobs to our area.
But I don't think any of us thought we'd have 560 new jobs on the way before we even cut the ribbon to officially open this short line railroad.
"I feel like we just swept the World Series of economic development with our broad-based approach to attracting jobs.
Attracting Sony was the first big victory.
Putting together the complex financial package and business plan for this rail line was a tough but key victory, because it gave our team the momentum to attract American Video Glass to the site across the street from Sony.
And the Economic Development Through Sustainable Forestry initiative we began here in Fayette County three years ago, combined with the rail access, were the keys to our victory in attracting Fay-Penn Fiber to the Fairchance Industrial Park.
"I've played a lead role in every single one of these victories, but none of it would have happened if we didn't have great teamwork from the federal, state and local levels, so I commend everyone who's been involved."
Murtha asked CSX to sell the lines to the community in a Sept. 1993 meeting in Washington.
He worked closely with CSX and PennDOT to arrange for the sale of the line from Connellsville south to Fay-Penn Economic Development for $5.3 million in exchange for sale of the line from Connellsville north to the Sony plant for $1.
He also was instrumental in obtaining $900,000 in federal funds for the project.
Both lines are run by the newly formed Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad.
Meanwhile, American Video Glass is building a plant and hiring 450 people, and Fay-Penn Fiber has announced plans to build a fiber board plant and employ about 110 people.

Murtha Announces Sewer and Jobs Initiatives
BLAIRSVILLE, October 18, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced a $1.75 million sewerage project to connect the Corporate Campus near here plus an additional $400,000 loan to the Indiana County Commissioners to stimulate jobs growth at another county industrial park.
"The Corporate Campus is ideally situated to attract new industries and provide room for area businesses to grow and create new jobs," Murtha said.
"With the great location at the intersection of Route 22 and Route 119, plus a short distance from both the Latrobe and Indiana airports, the county estimates that this site will create 250 new jobs over the next few years, with long-term potential to contain 700 jobs.
With such clear job-development potential, it's easy to see why we all agreed that Corporate Campus was a top priority for the limited Corps of Engineers pilot project funding."
Murtha said the $1.75 million sewerage project would be constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The project will extend sewerage to three parts of Burrell Township, including to the Corporate Campus.
The funding is part of a pilot program on rural infrastructure development created by Murtha to serve parts of Western and Central Pennsylvania.
Because of the special funding and direct involvement of the Army Corps, monthly costs for residential customers will be held to $40.
"We've been working on this initiative for some time, and we've got everybody ready to move quickly," Murtha said.
"By this time next year, we could be opening the site and be welcoming our first new jobs to Burrell Township."
In March, Murtha announced the approval of a $900,000 grant from the Economic Development Administration and Appalachian Regional Commission to build the internal infrastructure of the Corporate Campus.
Two weeks ago, ARC came through with a second grant of $350,000 to cover part of the cost of building a structure to house a Small Business Incubator and an "Innovation Center" that will draw on the expertise of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
This facility will support 76 jobs.
Combined, the three federal grants total $3 million.
In addition, $336,700 is committed from the State Industrial Development Authority and $613,000 is committed in bank and utility loans to the county for the building.
Today Murtha also announced another award for county job-development efforts: $400,000 from the Rural Economic and Community Development program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
These funds will become a loan to the county to help finance a second building already under construction at the Indiana County Commerce Park in Indiana.
A lease already has been executed for the building by Biocontrol Technology, Inc.
The USDA funds are awarded as a grant to the Allegheny Electric Cooperative, Inc., a parent organization of the area Rural Electric Association.
The Cooperative will lend the proceeds to Indiana County, which in turn is making the money available to the Indiana County Development Corp. to finance a second building at Commerce Park.
"Economic development doesn't just happen.
It takes a lot of effort by a lot of people, who work step-by-step toward progress.
I'm proud to be able to help move these projects forward, but I certainly want to commend the County Commissioners, the Planning Office, the state legislators, the Burrell Township officials, the Corps of Engineers and everybody else who's played a role in helping to bring job development to our community," Murtha said.

Murtha Announces Job-Infrastructure Grant
KITTANNING, October 16, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced the approval of a $225,000 grant to the Armstrong County Industrial Development Authority to provide an access road and water and sewer infrastructure for expanding the West Hills Industrial Park in East Franklin Township.
"This project is needed for the industrial park to expand, which is a key to attracting and growing new jobs in the area," Murtha said.
"Job development doesn't just happen.
It comes about when a lot of people work together in a step-by-step plan."
The grant will be part of a $2 million project that combines state and local funding to extend water and sewer lines for more than a mile, plus provide over a mile of access road and storm drainage.
This infrastructure will serve an additional 175 acres, more than doubling the size of the current industrial park, which currently has 11 tenants and 303 jobs.
"With the deficit reduced by 60 percent in the past few years, federal funding is extremely tight and competitive," Murtha said.
"So landing this grant was no easy task, and once again illustrates how important it is for all of our leaders from the local level up through Congress to work together for our common good."

Murtha: Sewer Project at Sony Key to 2,000 Jobs
NEW STANTON, October 13, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced that federal funding has been obtained to extend sewage utilities to a new Westmoreland County industrial park with potential to attract 2,000 jobs to our area.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers budget for fiscal 1997 includes $600,000 inserted by a Murtha amendment in an environmental-infrastructure pilot program for parts of Pennsylvania.
Under the program, the Corps of Engineers will expand the sewage system to the new industrial park.
"This industrial park has generated a lot of interest because it's adjacent to the Sony plant, making it attractive to potential Sony suppliers, and because it's adjacent to the new short line railroad with access to both the Conrail and CSX main lines," Murtha said.
The industrial park is being developed on 159 acres conveyed to the county by Sony a few years ago.
Murtha said the strong interest in the site has made it an urgent priority, and Westmoreland officials hope to have the project done within 12 months.
The project involves extension of sewage lines and construction of a pump station.
Reflecting on the snowy day when he and then-Gov. Casey went to New Jersey to convince Sony to come to Western Pennsylvania, Murtha said, "We've come a long way already with 1,200 people working at Sony and another 450 soon to be working at the new American Video Glass Co. plant that's under construction.
And by preserving the railroad connection and developing this new industrial park, we can potentially more than double the jobs in this area."
Murtha also was instrumental in obtaining federal and state funding for county economic-development organizations to obtain rail lines running south through Connellsville and north to the Sony plant.
The rail lines are being operated as the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad and will service the new industrial park.
"We're seizing the opportunity to attract more jobs to the area around the Sony Technology Center, which will be another great boost for Westmoreland and Fayette Counties," Murtha said.
The previously opened Westmoreland Technology Park has one tenant in operation and two more coming on board.
The Sony tract soon will be a second industrial park in this part of East Huntingdon Township.

Murtha: ARC Grant Another Step to Jobs Progress
BLAIRSVILLE, October 3, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today hailed the Appalachian Regional Commission approval of a $350,000 grant to Indiana County as "a key step in our ongoing job-development effort."
The ARC, an independent federal commission, awarded the funding to help build a facility that will house both a Small Business Incubator and an "Innovation Center" that will draw on the expertise at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
"This is just one piece of the overall funding to develop the Corporate Campus, but it's obviously a very important piece because it will create economic activity almost immediately," said Murtha.
"We recently announced a $900,000 federal grant to develop infrastructure within the Corporate Campus industrial park, and we hope within a matter of weeks to have the final piece of essential funding locked into place to extend sewage lines to the park.
"The great location at the intersection of Routes 22 and 119 make this an attractive site for job development, so it's been a very high priority for us and we're pleased by today's anouncement," Murtha added.
The Incubator and Innovation Center are expected to create at least 76 jobs.
In addition to the ARC money, $336,700 is committed from the State Industrial Development Authority and $613,300 is committed in bank and utility loans to the county for the $1.3 million building.

Murtha Thanks Sony, Pleased by Ongoing Progress
East Huntingdon, August 19, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today said he is excited about the continuing success and progress of Sony Technology Center-Pittsburgh, the pace of construction at the American Video Glass Company manufacturing site, the job development prospects for a new industrial park near the Sony plant, and the local short-line railroad.
After touring Sony's new 35-inch Trinitron TV production line, Murtha said he was pleased to hear that the introduction of the new 35-inch TVs went better than expected for Sony.
And he thaked Sony for making available 159 acres of nearby land for development as an industrial park.
"I'm continually impressed by what a good community citizen Sony is, and makng that land available for economic development was another example of the positive impact Sony's having," he said.
The previously opened Westmoreland Technology Park has one tenant in operation, a second company with a building under construction and a third company that just signed a letter of intent to move in.
The land conveyed by Sony to the county will be developed into a second industrial park, Murtha said, nothing that he is working closely with county officials to get utilities into the site.
"There's a strong interest in the site because the short-line railroad provides connections to both Conrail and CSX," said Murtha, who's been involved in every step locally going back to the initial effort to attract Sony to the area.
Murtha recalls traveling to New Jersey with then-Gov. Casey on a snowy day to finalize the deal, and now Sony has 1,200 workers here.
He later worked with Sony to get the nitrous-oxide air-emissions credits required by the Environmental Protection Agency to build the American Video Glass plant, where about 450 people will be employed sooon.
Then he worked with federal and state transportation officials to identify funding for county economic-development organizations to obtain rail lines running south through Connellsville and north to the Sony plant.

Small Business Measures To Fuel Jobs Growth
Mount Pleasant, August 15, 1996 -- Several laws passed by Congress in recent weeks will help small business, U.S. Rep. Murtha told the Mount Pleasant Chamber of Commerce today.
"As a former small businessman, I know first hand how challenging it is to meet the payroll and overhead month in and month out," said Murtha.
"And I also know that all of our jobs growth has come from small business.
That's why I'm pleased that America's small businesses are finally getting the attention they deserve."
Murtha noted that the latest unemployment rates have dropped a lot in our area, falling to 5.5% from 6.2% in Westmoreland County, and to 7.0% from 8.5% in Fayette County.
He attributed the progress not only to small-business growth, but also to the low interest rates and significant progress in reducing the deficit.
"We've cut the deficit 60% since Clinton became President, and I hope we can keep Washington focused on continuing our progress toward a balanced budget," he said.
Murtha said passage of an increase in the minimum wage provided the impetus to bring these issues up for passage, noting that he was in the forefront in saying thatwe needed to increase the minimum wage and at the same time provide extra help to small businesses.
He said one of the most significant new laws aimed at job creation came out of the White House Conference on Small Business last year, commending the president for recognizing the need to help small business.
That measure increases the annual deduction that businesses can take for new equipment from the current level of $17,500 up to $25,000 over seven years.
The measure means small businesses get a quicker write-off when they buy new equipment.
"The measure I've personally pushed for is the health-insurance deduction for people who are self-employed," Murtha said.
"I've always felt that it's unfair that big companies can write off health-care costs while the little guy can't, and this law changes that."
Self employed people will be able to write off an increasing share of their health-care costs each year through 2006.
The current deduction of 30% rises to 40% in 1997 and then 5% a year, eventually reaching 80%.
Murtha also supported pension reform, the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees, and the Work Opportunities Tax Credit, which allows companies to write off part of the wages of people who are hired off of Welfare, people in families recieving food stamps, and former felons, vocational-rehabilitation referals and high-risk youths.

Southern Alleghenies Awarded Grant
JOHNSTOWN, July 1, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced the awarding of a $400,000 grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission to Southern Alleghenies Planning and Development Commission for a program aimed a job retention and wage growth.
"We're working all the time to attract new jobs to the area, but the bottom line is that it's just as important to try to keep the jobs we already have and to help existing companies to grow and expand," said Murtha.
The grant provides half of the funding needed to continue the Enterprise Development Program for 1996-97, Murtha said.
The program offers and array of services, including export development, a manufacturers' marketing network, on-the-job training and strategic planning assistance.
Southern Alleghenies services a six-county area that includes Cambria and Somerset.
The $400,000 ARC grant will be combined with $147,000 from other federal sources, $213,000 from the state and $40,000 in local funds for a total $800,000 initiative.

Murtha Pleased by Ozone Agreement
WASHINGTON, May 21, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today expressed his appreciation to officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for working with the state to reach a compromise agreement on development of a clean air plan for Western Pennsylvania.
"We all share the long-term objective of reducing the health and financial costs that come from poor air quality," said Murtha.
"We all agree that allowing stakeholder input will produce a plan that's more likely to succeed.
So I'm pleased that we'll now have the time necessary to develop a plan that has the best chance of meeting everyone's long-term objective.
And I'm also encouraged because I believe this process holds greater potential for developing a plan that's more fair to the average car owner."
Murtha last week initiated a letter for the region's congresmen urging the President to support a compromise.

Murtha: Business Park Key to Ongoing Efforts
MANOR TOWNSHIP, May 17, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today issued the following statement at the groundbreaking for the Manor Township Business Park located off Route 66 between Kittanning and Ford City.
"Economic development and job creation doesn't just happen.
Economic development is a process, it's something we work at constantly, it's something we work at step-by-step.
And certainly, breaking ground on this new Business Park is a major step.
"I want to commend the County Commissioners, the County Planning and Economic Development Department, the other state and local officials and everyone else who has worked to bring about this day.
Before we can have economic development, we must have several things in place -- the sewage, the water, the road network, and land available for quick development.
With this park, we'll have all these things situated conveniently between the two large communities of Ford City and Kittanning.
"Meanwhile, we're making progress on developing the Riverfront and Business District in Kittanning to capitalize on the growing tourism industry.
We see opportunities developing through the Electro-Optics Center.
We've made repairs to the locks and dams that support many jobs here.
We helped to develop high-tech links from rural patients to medical experts, built a satellite downlink facility to give farmers access to experts anywhere, and attracted special funding for the South Buffalo water project.
We've been working hard to sustain and diversify the Armstrong County economy.
With so much happening and now this new Business Park and a strong marketing campaign to attract business, I've been sensing a growing optimism in Armstrong County, a growing pride and confidence that by working together, we can overcome our economic difficulties.
"I'm pleased that we were able to work out the details to use the federal funds for the National Guard Armory here as a way of jump-starting the Business Park development, and I look forward to coming back in just a few months to break ground on that Armory."

Murtha Letter on Ozone Sent by W. Pa.
Delegation
WASHINGTON, May 15, 1996 -- A bipartisan group of six Western Pennsylvania Congressmen today sent a letter to President Clinton expressing concern about the serious adverse economic impact that would result from environmental sanctions for air quality.
The letter was addressed to President Clinton and signed by Congressmen John Murtha, Ron Klink, Michael F. Doyle, Frank Mascara, William J. Coyne and Phil English.
"We're constantly working to create, attract and retain jobs in Western Pennsylvania, and that's often very challenging," said Murtha, who drafted the letter as dean of the delegation.
"These sanctions would be a major setback to our efforts at economic expansion and diversification."
The letter emphasized the work that is already under way in Pennsylvania to address the ozone problem of the Pittsburgh region and urges the administration to support a compromise that avoids sanctions and allows for stakeholder input but sets milestones for progress.
"Pennsylvania's ozone pollution problem is complicated by the fact that about one-third of our pollution comes from other states which are not under the same Clean Air Act requirements," the letter states.
"We believe there must be a level playing field in pollution-control efforts.
Sanctioning Western Pennsylvania would only add to the competitive disadvantage of the area."
The text of the letter follows.
We are writing to you regarding an ozone air pollution problem in the Pittsburgh region of Pennsylvania and the possible imposition of sanctions on August 15, 1996, by the Environmental Protection Agency.
On May 1, the EPA turned down a request by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to reclassify the Pittsburgh Region as meeting the ozone pollution standard.
As a result, we understand that a seven-county region in southwestern Pennsylvania is subject to sanctions.
Such action would have a very serious adverse impact in an area that is already struggling economically.
Pennsylvania recognizes that we do have an ozone problem.
The Commonwealth has worked hard to reduce emissions and is committed to continuing its efforts.
The state has undertaken an innovative stakeholders process to develop a list of control measures that the public, the business community, and local officials can support and they need time to complete this critical process.
The state has already adopted aggressive standards for new sources of pollution and required new permits for existing sources when other states in the region have not yet implemented similar programs.
Finally, the state is on track to adopt an effective decentralized auto emission inspection program which will be coming on-line this fall.
Pennsylvania's ozone pollution problem is complicated by the fact that about one-third of our pollution comes from other states which are not under the same Clean Air Act requirements.
We believe there must be a level playing field in pollution control efforts.
Sanctioning western Pennsylvania would only add to the competitive disadvantage of the area.
It is our understanding the Pennsylvania state officials have been working with EPA regional officials to develop a plan that would allow the state officials additional time to submit their implementation plan while requiring them to meet milestones along the way.
We would strongly urge the Administration to agree to such a compromise which would avoid sanctions and allow Pennsylvania to complete its stakeholder process so that we can meet the goals of the Clean Air Act in a way that is acceptable to our citizens.

Murtha Endorses Retirement Savings 
April 12, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today gave his strong endorsement to President Clinton's proposed Retirement Savings and Security Act.
"This plan will help current and future retirees by guarding against the raiding of pension funds," Murtha said.
"The plan will help today's working families who are worried about whether they'll have an adequate retirement, especially if they've changed jobs two or three times.
And this plan will help small businesses provide retirement-savings plans with little paperwork."
Clinton announced the plan today in Washington, and Murtha was quick to recognize it as a landmark proposal.
"With corporate downsizings and plant closings, and with many younger workers being more educated and aggressive about making career moves, the typical worker today will hold more than two jobs throughout his or her lifetime," Murtha said.
"That means fewer people will have full, traditional pensions.
So it's absolutely essential that we give today's workers every opportunity to save for their retirement."
The Retirement Savings and Security Act has five parts: * 1.
A new Small Business 401(k) Plan, called the NEST, aims to expand pension coverage to 10 million workers who currently have no pension plans.
The proposal would allow workers to contribute up to $5,000 a year, tax-free; encourage employers to contribute 3% of salary or 1% plus a match of up to 5% of salary; cut through the red tape with a simple, one-page form for employers; and be 100% portable so workers can take their pension savings with them any time they change jobs.
* 2.
Expanded Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) would allow for withdrawals for education and training, first-home purchases, major medical expenses and long-term unemployment.
Income limits for tax-free eligibility would be doubled.
Currently, couples earning over $35,000 a year get limited deductions and those earning over $50,000 get no tax deduction; both numbers would be doubled under this plan, and the $2,000 maximum annual contribution would be indexed for inflation.
The goal is to encourage 20 million more families to use IRAs, in part by reducing the worry that savings are not available for health problems, job loss or certain other major expenses.
* 3.
Increased pension portability rules would help over 5 million workers a year who change jobs.
The proposal eliminates the 1-year wait to start adding to a pension plan at a new job; makes it easier for employers with 401(k) plans to accept rollovers from other 401(k) plans; and helps workers get the benefits they've earned by using the Pension Benefits Guarantee Corp. as a clearinghouse for "terminated" pension plans -- plans that have money even though the companies that created the plans are out of business.
* 4.
Prevents pension raiding by requiring Labor Department monitoring of attempts to buy a company primarily to take its pension plan funds.
These steps go beyond reforms enacted in the last two years.
* 5.
Enhances pension security by requiring prompt reports of misuse of pension funds, with fines up to $100,000, and tightens rules for companies "borrowing" from 401(k) plans.
"Social Security was set up to be a supplement to pensions and retirement savings -- not a full retirement plan," Murtha said.
"Today, 51 million working Americans have no employer-provided retirement plan.
And while three-fourths of the people working for large employers have pensions, less than one-fourth of the workers at small business have retirement plans.
With America's job growth coming in small companies, it's essential that we take steps to cover more people and offer better protection of those plans."

Murtha Announces Economic-Development Grant
WASHINGTON, March 6, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha announced approval today of a $900,000 grant for infrastructure development at the Corporate Campus industrial park near Blairsville.
"This is great news for our area because this park is such a vital part of our economic- and job-development effort," Murtha said.
"The grant will go for water and sewer lines, interior roads and improvements on the connecting roads into the facility, so this is a comprehensive development project."
Murtha praised the effort of the Indiana County Commissioners and the Indiana County Development Corporation in preparing a solid application, adding, "We've all recognized that the location of this park makes it a key in our economic-development plans."
He continued, "When I talk with employers about our region, access is among the first things they ask about.
With a location adjacent to two major highways and within 13 miles of two airports, we have a facility that will be very attractive to manufacturers looking at our area."
Projections are that 250 jobs could be created at the park over the next few years, with long-term potential for the facility to contain 700 jobs.
The site is near the intersection of Route 22 and Route 119 just east of Blairsville.
"This is the kind of step-by-step infrastructure development that's essential to the rebuilding of our local economy.
This is part of the foundation for our future growth, and it's part of our effort to develop an effective, comprehensive plan for job development, which remains our top goal for the region."

Murtha Lauds Global Competitiveness Efforts
LATROBE, February 7, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha hailed the Center for Global Competitiveness as the kind of program that generates economic growth and repays the initial government investment many times over.
"As a nation, we must continue to invest in the kinds of programs that generate small businesses and help small businesses succeed and grow," Murtha said, stressing that all of America's jobs growth in recent years has come from small businesses willing to take risks to grow.
The federally funded Center for Global Competitiveness is run by Saint Francis College in Loretto and Saint Vincent College here in Latrobe.
"When you think about the fact that we've already generated almost $900,000 for our area's economy from the Center's effort, and we're really just starting to crack the door to foreign markets, you can see the great potential that lies ahead," Murtha said.
"As these companies get firmly established with their unique products in distant markets, exports can be a steady part of their business and become a stabilizing factor in our economic and jobs base."
Murtha heard from the leaders of three businesses from a broad region that worked through the center to pursue exports.
He was told about:
* The success of Advanced Microsystems, Inc., of Uniontown in exporting its electronic distance-measuring devices to Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan.
The firm employs seven people.
* The success of Fibertek, Inc., of Scottdale in developing products from co-mingled, recycled plastics and seeking sales in Canada, as well as across the United States.
The firm employs 17 people.
* And the success of Hyde Park Foundry 
The firm employs 110 people.
"The thing that impresses me is that these companies are in very different businesses, spread out in a 100-mile radius, and yet they share the same aggressive, dynamic approach to growth that's coached by the Center for Global Competitiveness," Murtha said.
He noted that very little Washington attention used to go to small business, but as more former small businessmen such as himself got elected to Congress -- and as big companies and the federal government began a period of major downsizing -- others in Washington have joined the bandwagon to support small business.
"I know how tough it can be to meet payroll and cover all the expenses because I've been there," said Murtha.
"I think that's why I've worked so hard over the years to make help available to small businesses, so they can grow and create the jobs that our area and our nation needs.
These types of programs are an excellent investment for America."
The Congressman praised the effort of the Center at Saint Vincent, noting that the Center's assistance resulted in $891,125 in new export and domestic sales and $60,609 in financing secured.

Murtha Reviews Forestry Jobs Effort
UNIONTOWN, January 18, 1996 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha said today he is pleased to see the Pennsylvania Sustainable Forestry Development initiative moving forward in Southwestern Pennsylvania.
"Jobs are the bottom line here, and this program is set up to generate jobs in our rural communities," said Murtha, who worked to create the program under the U.S. Forestry Service after meeting directly with companies in the forestry and wood-products industry two years ago here.
The program was designed in cooperation with the PA Department of Commerce's Hardwood Development Council, the PA Bureau of Forestry, and the state's Hardwood Utilization Groups (HUGs), including the Southwestern Pennsylvania HUG that serves Fayette, Westmoreland, Indiana, Armstrong and other southwestern counties.
The effort was expanded to a state-wide initiative that gained bi-partisan support from Congressmen Bud Shuster and Bill Clinger, and received special federal funding under the Forestry Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The program has several components, but the ones that are most important to small companies in wood-based industries are: * * John E. Pletcher, recently hired as the Sustainable Forestry Development Coordinator, is visiting businesses to provide technical assistance for companies or entrepreneurs that are considering expanding or creating forest-based businesses.
* * The "WoodNet" is being developed to include information on timber-related companies in Pennsylvania.
WoodNet is a computer database that will match products and capabilities of individual companies with the needs of companies that buy wood or wood products.
WoodNet works in conjunction with M-Net for all manufacturers.
Both of these efforts should help us create jobs in rural areas," said Murtha.
"These companies tend to be very small and spread out across the mountains where they're hardly noticed.
So they've often had a difficult time getting technical support, and their products and capabilities can be forgotten when companies look for new suppliers of wood or wood products."
He added, "There's always a tendency to want to attract a new business to a community, and we work on that constantly.
But in rural areas, I feel we'll create more jobs faster if we build on our strengths and help our existing businesses to grow.
That's exactly what we're trying to do here."

Murtha Sees Continuing Economic Progress
JOHNSTOWN, Jan. 11, 1996 -- As Washington moves toward a balanced budget and government funds become increasingly limited, U.S. Rep. John Murtha told the Greater Johnstown Committee today that he expects community growth and economic diversification to continue because of the area's excellent foresight, planning and cooperation.
"One key to our progress is that we created a vision of the future that looked at infrastructure, work skills and targeted growth industries," Murtha said.
"We recognized that people with a strong work ethic and family values are our strongest regional asset, and we recognized that economic progress doesn't happen over night.
We've been working hard to develop our area's economy step by step."
Murtha noted that the Cambria-Somerset economy has produced 12,000 jobs in the past 12 years, and attributed much of the progress to the areas that were targeted for growth, he said, specifically:
* About 5,000 people work for companies in Cambria and Somerset Counties that do at least some of their work for the government, thanks largely to the Government Procurement Assistance Center and Showcase for Commerce that Murtha has worked with so closely.
Many of these are high-tech manufacturing jobs.
* Nearly 1,000 people work at new federal installations -- the National Drug Intelligence Center, the centers of excellence run by Concurrent Technologies Corporation and the federal Prison at Loretto.
Another 100 or more jobs will be created when the Army Reserve Aviation Facility begins operations at the Johnstown Airport late this year, he said, noting that our federal base is in areas that are being emphasized even in the downsizing of government -- prisons, drug counterdiction, research and reliance on the Guard and Reserve more than active-duty military.
* Tourism now generates 6,500 jobs in Cambria and Somerset Counties, and is one of our strongest growth areas because Murtha helped to focus attention on our region's rich ethnic and industrial heritage, plus our beautiful streams and mountains.
In the nine counties served by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission, travel and tourism is the No. 1 industry, generating $1.3 billion worth of economic activity accounting for one of every 13 jobs.
"At the same time, we've succeeded in saving a substantial portion of our basic industry as major steelmakers pulled out," he continued.
"We created the Cambria County Area Community College to fill a critical need to provide workers with the skills needed for the next-generation of jobs.
And we're making substantial progress in improving the infrastructure."
"With our vision, our dedication, and our solid work force, I believe we'll continue to see jobs growth in this region," he said.

Murtha: Prison To Boost Indiana Economy
January 3, 1996 -- A site near Indiana has been chosen for a new state prison, U.S. Rep. John Murtha announced today.
"This facility will provide a major boost to the struggling Indiana area economy," Murtha said.
"We work every day to attract jobs to our area, and opportunities to bring 350 jobs in one fell swoop are few and far between."
Murtha noted that he's been working for several years with community elected and economic leaders to identify sites that meet the criteria for a prison, and he expressed his appreciation to Gov. Tom Ridge and the Governor's staff for considering sites identified by the local team the Congressman helped to assemble.
"I want to also commend the local leaders and state legislators for working so well together," Murtha continued.
"Cooperation was a key to bringing these 350 jobs to our area."
Murtha said the facility will take three years to design and build; it will initially house 500 young offenders and will be located in White Township north of Indiana.

Conference Stresses Tourism's Job Impact
WASHINGTON, November 1, 1995 -- Representatives to the White House Conference on travel and Tourism stressed that tourism is an industry when they provided feedback to U.S. Rep. John Murtha before leaving Washington.
Susan Torrance, director of the Armstrong County Tourism Bureau, the official delegate from the 12th Congressional District, said after the Conference, "This was an excellent opportunity.
It drove home the concept that tourism is an industry, which should be planned for and should be encouraged.
We have a lot of potential in our area, and we need to build on that and tap into the resources that are here."
Brent Glass, executive director of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, outlined the national goals promoted in the White House Conference, including:
* To demonstrate the economic power of the travel and tourism industry, in part by developing a uniform system of collecting, reporting and measuring the economic impact.
* To ensure the American travel experience is second to none by preserving our natural, historic and cultural resources, and enhancing the visitor experience.
* To create a public-private partnership to guide national policy on tourism development.
Murtha, a member of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, said our area is ahead of many parts of the nation in its development and promotion of tourism.
"We recognized a decade ago that tourism could generate jobs and economic impact, and we're seeing that proven in the studies of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission showing that tourism is now the region's No. 1 industry.
My vision for our region is to continue our economic revitalization in part by taking advantage of our rich heritage and our beautiful mountains, streams and rivers.
Tourism can help the worldsee us for what we are: hard-working, industrious people who developed one of the most beautiful areas of the world."

Congressmen Announce $67,000 'WoodNet' Grant
August 29, 1995 -- Congressmen John Murtha (PA-12), Bill Clinger (PA-5) and Bud Shuster (PA-9) today announced a $67,000 Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) grant that will provide funding for WoodNet, an economic-development tool expected to create jobs in Pennsylvania's hardwoods industry.
"Pennsylvania has more hardwoods in its forests than any other state, and that can mean good jobs for our rural communities," Murtha said.
"In speaking with people in the industry, the U.S. Forest Service and the state Commerce Department, it became readily apparent that we could make better use of our hardwoods and create jobs in the process."
WoodNet is a computerized network developed by Susquehanna Economic Development Authority-Council of Governments (SEDA-COG) to link the state's hardwood suppliers with manufacturers nationwide and around the globe.
Murtha, Clinger and Shuster announced WoodNet as part of a multi-faceted forestry pilot project during a joint press conference in April.
The ARC grant to SEDA-COG will expand WoodNet, a matchmaker network that serves as a central database containing information about Pennsylvania hardwoods companies.
It will help to efficiently identify those suppliers that have the capability to fill orders of various cut specifications and quantities.
The ARC grant will be matched with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forestry Service, state and local funds.
Altogether, the forest-products matchmaker network is a $169,000 project that is estimated to generate over $500,000 of economic impact after its first year of operation.
The network serves 40 Western Pennsylvania counties, including those in Southwestern Pennsylvania Hardwoods Utilization Council (including Fayette, Westmoreland, Indiana, and Armstrong) and those in Southern Alleghenies Hardwoods Utilization Group (including Cambria and Somerset).

Murtha: Project Is Cornerstone in Revitalization
KITTANNING, August 24, 1995 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today hailed the community's vision for a new Downtown and Riverfront as "a cornerstone for the economic revitalization of Kittanning and the whole region as we move into the 21st Century."
"Economic development doesn't just happen -- it happens when a community pulls together and unites behind a plan, behind a common vision for who we are and where we want to go," said Murtha.
"The vision for a new downtown Kittanning linked to the Riverfront is just a start, and I'm delighted that so many community leaders have come out today to help us take our vision from concept to reality."
Murtha made his comments at a briefing on the project, which was initiated with a federal grant.
The briefing involved state and regional organizations and the architect that has initiated planning.
"Although we're still planning, I see the community beginning to recognize the potential this project has, not only for Kittanning but for all of Armstrong County," said Murtha.
"This will be a complete makeover that will draw tourists, revitalize downtown businesses, make the county seat more attractive and thereby enhance our efforts to attract new industry with new jobs."
He stressed that the impact will reach far beyond Kittanning, announcing that the Steel Industry Heritage Corporation has been authorized to consider sites in Armstrong County for inclusion in a multi-county heritage-tourism effort.
Liz White, President of the Armstrong County Chamber of Commerce, said, "This project is unparalleled.
It's an exciting opportunity for our area and a prime example of good government when we see our federal legislator working hand-in-hand with our state legislators and our local community leaders.
With the impact this project will have, this effort can be a model for communities across the state."
The project will develop a strategy to revitalize the downtown business district and link businesses with the Riverfront Park as an overall economic-development effort.

Murtha Helps Somerset Businesses
SOMERSET, August 9, 1995 -- Rep. John Murtha praised two area businesses today for preserving and creating jobs in our area -- Jay Automotive Specialties, Inc., of Berlin, which was named a "Prime Contractor of the Year" by the U.S. Small Business Administration, and Bender Shoe Co., whose plant was deemed to be in the flood plain.
"As a former owner of a small business, I know how challenging it is to run a small business today," Murtha said.
"And when a business fails, it puts people out of work.
That's why we work so hard to help the small businesses in our area."
The broad spectrum of issues confronting business is illustrated by these two companies, he said.
Jay Automotive in less than 20 years has grown to employ over 70 people operating car-parts stores on 24 military bases Many of those jobs were threatened when the Defense Department proposed to close on-base facilities and give base personnel credit cards to buy auto parts at off-base commercial suppliers.
Murtha asked the General Accounting Office to compare costs and, as he suspected, the GAO found that Jay's costs were lower.
"Jay and their employees work hard to provide Defense installations with needed auto parts quickly and efficiently while saving taxpayer dollars -- and that's the reason they've been chosen as Region 3 winner of the Small Business Administration's Prime Contractor of the Year Award for 1994," he said.
"Here's a case where we were able to save the government money and save the jobs in our area, so it's a win-win situation."
Bender faced an uncommon problem.
Its parent company, B.B. Walker Co. of North Carolina, invested in the Somerset plant that was not considered to be in the 100-year flood plain.
Then the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency amended the flood plain and determined that the plant was within the flood-prone area, which resulted in a large increase in flood-insurance costs.
The increased costs forced B.B. Walker to consider moving and the flood-plain designation would have ruled out any possible future expansion.
Bender contacted the Congressman, who asked the Army Corps of Engineers to re-examine the site.
The re-examination found that, although one end of the building was in the flood plain, the main floor of the plant was 1 1/2 feet above the flood plain.
"Bender's been able to add about 25 new jobs since moving to this location.
But if the flood issue hadn't been resolved, we could have lost both the new jobs and the old jobs, impacting over 200 workers," Murtha said.

Sony Partners' American Video Glass Is Key Step
NEW STANTON, June 7, 1995 -- Rep. Murtha offered the following statement today about plans to develop the American Video glass facility here:
Today's announcement that the new parnership, American Video Glass Company, will bring an additional $300 million investment and 500 jobs initially to New Stanton marks a major step forward in our area's continuing economic rebuilding.
The commitment of Sony, Corning and Asahi to our area is a recognition of the quality of our workforce, the way our area pulls together for the common good, and a recognition of the groundwork we've laid for the area's growth.
That's why I'm so pleased today to welcome the companies and wish them the best of luck in their new partnership.
I well remember the snowy day when then-Governor Bob Casey and I traveled to New Jersey in hopes of convincing Sony to take over the abandoned former Volkswagen plant.
When we attracted Sony to Pennsylvania, we got much more than just a new tenant in a vacant plant.
We got a forward-looking, 21st Century company that brings not just jobs, but high-tech opportunities, innovative management and creative vision that provides a keystone to our economic efforts.
I've continued to work closely with Sony on several issues, most recently to save the rail connection to their facility and, with the EPA, to resolve the air-quality issue that was the last key in clearing the way for today's announcement.
I will continue to work just as diligently with Sony's new partner, Corning Asahi, to see that their new venture here is as successful as Sony's.
With Sony and now the new American Video Glass Company, we're looking forward to a bright, high-tech future for the people of our area.

Initiative Focuses on Rural Job Development across Pennsylvania
WASHINGTON, April 4, 1995 -- Three Members of Congress from large, rural districts today announced a new pilot project that seeks to create jobs across rural Pennsylvania through sustainable use of forest resources.
U.S. Reps. John Murtha, Bud Shuster and Bill Clinger announced the new partnership initiative between the U.S. Forest Service, Pennsylvania Hardwoods Development Council, Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry and several regional and local organizations representing people in wood-based industry.
The announcement was made via satellite to downlink facilities across Western and West-Central Pennsylvania.
"Pennsylvania has more hardwoods standing in its forests than any state in America," said Murtha, who initiated the effort after meeting with forest-industry leaders 15 months ago in Fayette County.
"It's time we recognize the economic potential of forests and focus our efforts on using this resource to create new job opportunities for Pennsylvanians."
Shuster added, "The economies in most rural areas have historically lagged behind most urban economies, so we feel this is the kind of clearly focused economic-development activity that will be repaid many times as we expand job opportunities in rural Pennsylvania."
The initiative will use $191,000 from the U.S. Forest Service and $321,700 from state and local agencies and groups.
The pilot program will have a five-pronged approach to rural job development:
* Sustainable Development Coordinator.
A coordinator will work directly with the forest-based industry, entrepreneurs, bankers and others to create sustainable economic expansion.
The coordinator will design and implement forest-based sustainable-development strategies, provide "hands-on" technical assistance to businesses and entrepreneurs who expand or start wood-based businesses, and identify and implement appropriate technologies to foster expansion.
* Forest Products Matchmaker Network.
"WoodNet" computerized matchmaker network developed by Susquehanna Economic Development Authority-Council of Governments (SEDA-COG) will be implemented first in western Pennsylvania and then the rest of the state.
WoodNet will efficiently identify which of Pennsylvania's 2,300 wood-products companies could fill a specific order.
Now, there is no easy way to identify companies that could supply a specific kind of wood cut to needed dimensions.
"WoodNet" is projected to generate over $500,000 of economic impact in its first year alone.
* Value-Added Products from Wood Residues.
The project will encourage development of products from wood waste.
The first step is to conduct a market analysis of the amounts of sawdust and other wood residues available in specific areas.
The analysis will be offered to companies that could use the residues to make products, such as medium-density fiberboard (MDF) or bio-mass energy.
Much of this waste is landfilled at significant cost to the industry, but one MDF plant alone could eliminate those industry costs while creating up to 150 jobs.
* Tourism Development.
The project will encourage use of wood in developing and maintaining historic and recreational facilities.
Areas with major hardwoods forests have beautiful landscapes of mountains, streams, vistas and historic resources that attract tourists.
Bridges and other structures made of wood will blend in better with natural environments and be more historically correct.
Two timber bridges will be built on the PW
* Public Needs and Interests Assessment.
For economic activity to be sustained, institutional and community support are key.
An assessment of public needs and interests will determine local understanding of forest resources and involve local people in crafting and implementing the economic strategy for community wood-based development.
"Our wood-based industries already are the fourth-largest industrial employer in Pennsylvania, and the potential exists for substantial expansion," said Clinger.

Murtha Hails Health Insurance Tax Deduction
WASHINGTON, March 30, 1995 - U.S. Rep. John Murtha praised the final passage of legislation in the House of Representatives which restores the tax deduction for health insurance for individuals who are self-employed and makes this deduction permanent.
"This bill finally makes this deduction permanent, and it's a step toward fairness for the self-employed," said Murtha.
"Big corporations get a tax deduction for their contributions to employee health plans, and it's only fair that small business owners, farmers, and other self-employed people should be able to deduct their health insurance costs too."
Legislation restoring a 25% deduction passed the House of Representatives a month ago, and the House today passed a compromise version of the bill already approved by the Senate which makes the 25% deduction retroactive for 1994 and increases the deduction to 30% for 1995 and every year after.
With the passage of this version by the House, the bill now goes to the President to be signed into law.

Worker Training Center for the Environmental Industry
INDIANA, January 16, 1995 -- U.S. Rep. John Murtha today announced creation of the National Environmental Education and Training Center, Inc., (NEETC), a not-for-profit initiative that should reduce risks to workers involved in environmental remediation.
"Environmental remediation will soon be a $50 billion a year industry in America," Murtha said.
"We're spending over $12 billion a year on environmental clean-up in the Defense Department alone.
And quite frankly, I'm concerned that we need to do more to make sure the health of workers on these jobs is adequately protected."
Seed money to create NEETC was provided by a $3.5 million Defense Department grant.
NEETC will develop education, training and research initiatives through academia, labor unions and the construction industry.
Indiana University of Pennsylvania will spearhead the academic portion of the effort through its College of Safety and Health Sciences, one of the few programs of its kind in the nation.
Other institutional partners in the program are the Center to Protect Workers' Rights, the Laborers' Health and Safety Fund of North America, the Laborers International Union of North America, the National Constructors Association, and the National Erectors Association.
There soon will be a million workers in the environmental remediation industry, but very few can identify hazardous material, let alone assess what on-site workers should do to protect their health.
