Foreword
Extensive research efforts have provided considerable insight into the design, operation and performance of natural and constructed wetlands treatment systems.
Wastewater treatment is a problem that has plagued man ever since he discovered that discharging his wastes into surface waters can lead to many additional environmental problems.
The Clean Water Act (P.L.92-500 passed in 1972 and its more recent amendments) led to the construction of many new wastewater treatment facilities across the country to help control water pollution.
In the future add-on processes will be needed to upgrade many of these treatment facilities.
In addition, more attention will need to be given to controlling the many small volume, point sources as well as the numerous non-point sources of water pollution if the water quality objectives of the Clean Water Act are ever to be fully realized.
grass Intensive studies carried out for over 5 years at Santee, CA, evaluated the performance of constructed wetlands experimental units planted with reeds, cattails, and bulrush.
Today, a wide range of treatment technologies are available for use in our efforts to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nations waters.
During the past 20 years, considerable interest has been expressed in the potential use of a variety of natural biological systems to help purify water in a controlled manner.
These natural biological treatment systems include various forms of ponds, land treatment and wetlands systems.
As a result of both extensive research efforts and practical application of these technologies, considerable insight has been gained into their design, performance, operation and maintenance.
Much of this experience has been summarized in project summaries, research reports, technical papers and design guidance.
Some of the earliest investigations to explore the capabilities of various wetland and other aquatic plant systems to help treat wastewater were undertaken in various European countries by Seidel, Kickuth, de Jong and others.
Related studies were eventually undertaken by Spangler, Sloey, Small, Gersberg, Goldman, Dinges, Wolverton, Reddy, Richardson and others in numerous locations across the U.S.
Kadlec, Odum and Ewel, Valiela, Teal, and others have undertaken long-term assessments of the capabilities of several types of natural wetlands to handle wastewater additions.
Funding provided by the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of the Interior, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Department of Agriculture and others has played an important role in stimulating the development of the available information and guidance on constructed wetland treatment systems in the U.S.
Generally EPA discourages the use of natural wetlands for wastewater treatment, unless carefully designed and managed to protect their multi-functional values.
However, certain wetlands may benefit from the timed release of treated wastewater effluents, such as drier and degraded wetlands.
Even though it is recognized that wetlands provide water quality improvement functions, these benefits should not be traded at the expense of other wetland functions (i.e., habitat value).
When natural wetlands are used for these purposes there is a need for monitoring to assure the maintenance of the wetland system.
pipe Long-term observations and studies of northern wetlands receiving wastewater effluents have followed the impact of changes in nutrient loadings and hydrology on vegetation and wildlife use at projects such as the Drummond Bog in Northern Wisconsin.
While it appears that many wetlands have some capacity for improving water quality of wastewater, runoff, or industrial discharges, some wetlands are clearly not appropriate for continuous day-in/day-out use as a part of a wastewater disposal or treatment system.
The potential for altering the biotic communities of natural wetlands when including them in wastewater management is of great concern to EPA and groups interested in preserving existing wetlands.
Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment involve the use of engineered systems that are designed and constructed to utilize natural processes.
These systems are designed to mimic natural wetland systems, utilizing wetland plants, soils and their associated microorganisms to remove contaminants from wastewater effluents.
As with other natural biological treatment technologies, wetlands treatment systems are capable of achieving additional benefits.
The renovation and reuse of wastewater with constructed wetland systems also provides an opportunity to successfully create or restore valuable wetland habitat for wildlife use and environmental enhancement.
The operational experience and research results reported in the available literature suggest that the growing interest in the use of constructed wetlands as a part of water treatment offers considerable opportunity for realizing sizable future savings in wastewater treatment costs for small communities and for upgrading even large treatment facilities.
At the same time, as is demonstrated by the 17 wetland treatment system case studies located in 10 states that are presented in this document, these systems can provide valuable wetland habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife, as well as areas for public education and recreation.
Clearly such systems create an opportunity to contribute to the Nations efforts to restore, maintain and create valuable wetland habitat.
