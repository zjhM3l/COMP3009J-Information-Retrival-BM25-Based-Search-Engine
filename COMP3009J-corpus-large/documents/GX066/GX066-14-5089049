CDC and others helped end latest outbreak __________________________________________________________________
Washington -- The World Health Organization February 28 publicly thanked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a host of other international medical organizations for their help in bringing an end to the latest outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Uganda.
According to a WHO press release, more than 20 international NGOs and government agencies from WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network worked together to combat the outbreak.
In particular, WHO cited the CDC, Epicentre, Health Canada, Italian Cooperation, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), the Red Cross, and UNICEF, together with institutions in Belgium, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, for working closely with the doctors, nurses, and staff at Gulu Hospital and Lacor Hospital, and with Ugandan government officials.
"The successful operation in Uganda," the release said, "emphasized what can be achieved when we identify epidemic threats rapidly and act together swiftly.
"Today we recognize the efforts of the people of Uganda, and the contributions and achievements of our partners," David Heymann, executive director of WHO's effort to fight communicable diseases, explained in the release.
"Epidemic-prone diseases are harmful to communities and ignore national borders," he warned.
"We need to recognize them as threats to global health security and coordinate effective international solutions."
The Uganda Ebola outbreak, which was first reported in October 2000, is now officially over, the release said, adding that the last person to be infected by the virus recovered 42 days ago -- twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola.
The international response in support of the government of Uganda helped to break the cycle of transmission of the virus, which killed 224 people in Uganda, including health workers.
Among them was Dr. Matthew Lukwiya, the Ugandan who first identified the outbreak.
In this regard, WHO is working to mobilize the international community to strengthen epidemic alert and response and raise awareness of the global threat of infectious diseases.
Global health security will be a top agenda item at this year's World Health Assembly.
Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) is one of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing death in 50-90 percent of all clinically ill cases.
The virus was first identified in a western equatorial province of Sudan and in a nearby region of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1976 after significant epidemics in Yambuku, northern Zaire, and Nzara, southern Sudan.
Including the most recent outbreak, about 1500 cases with more than 1000 deaths have been documented since the virus was discovered.
