Return to Publication List _________________________________________________________________ CITRUS DECEMBER FORECAST MATURITY TEST RESULTS AND FRUIT SIZE December 12, 1996 Florida Agricultural Statistics Service | 1222 Woodward Street | Orlando, Florida 32803 | 407 / 648-6013 _________________________________________________________________ FORECAST DATES 1996-97 SEASON January 9, 1997 February 12, 1997 March 11, 1997 April 11, 1997 May 12, 1997 June 12, 1997 July 11, 1997 ORANGES UNCHANGED AT 220.00 MILLION BOXES The 1996-97 Florida all orange forecast (excluding Temples), released today by the USDA Agricultural Statistics Board, remains at 220.00 million boxes.
If realized, this will be 8 percent more than the 203.2 million boxes harvested in 1995-96 and the largest crop on record.
The previous record of 206.7 million boxes was harvested in 1979-80.
In the past 10 non-freeze seasons the December all orange forecast has deviated from recorded final production by an average of 4.5 percent.
Five years were above and five years below the average.
Objective counts and measurements taken in sample groves during October and November have been used to monitor fruit sizing and droppage since the initial October forecast.
These data are used to update projections to harvest for the current season.
Observations to date continue to support earlier projections of average fruit size and below average droppage.
EARLY AND MIDSEASONS REMAIN AT 130.0 MILLION BOXES
Early and midseason oranges are forecast at 130.0 million boxes, unchanged from the initial forecast.
This includes a projection of 6.5 million boxes of Navels, also unchanged from October.
This forecast is a record for early and midseason varieties, 7 percent more than the previous record of 121.2 million boxes utilized last season.
The Navel crop is also projected to be a record, 25 percent greater than last season's 5.2 million boxes.
Fruit growth has continued favorable following a normal seasonal pattern.
Fruit size remains near average and droppage is below.
Size and drop field observation made through November support the October forecast.
Harvest of early and midseason varieties is progressing at a normal pace with nearly 18 million boxes (including Navels) utilized through December 1.
The previous two seasons were more advanced in harvest to date because of advanced maturity in those seasons.

VALENCIAS
HELD AT 90.0 MILLION BOXES The late type (Valencia) orange forecast is a record 90.0 million boxes, the same as October.
This forecast is almost 10 percent more than the 82.0 million boxes utilized last season and 1.2 million boxes above the previous record utilization in 1979-80.
As with early-midseason oranges, the two latest monthly surveys indicate fruit size and loss from droppage support closely those projections made for the October forecast.
Fruit size is projected to round to the average of the past 11 non-freeze seasons.
Loss from droppage is still expected to be below average.
There were no new indications to support a change in the forecast.
FCOJ REMAINS AT 1.53 GALLONS PER BOX
The all orange FCOJ yield projection remains at 1.53 gallon per box of 42.0 degrees Brix concen trate.
The Florida Citrus Processors Association final reported yield for last season was 1.522516 gallons per box.
The January 1997 crop forecast will include a separate projection of yield for early and midseason varieties and for late type oranges.
The percent Brix and the pounds solids per box for all types of oranges tested are higher for this December 1 than at the same time last year.

SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT UNCHANGED AT 58.0 MILLION BOXES
The all seedless grapefruit forecast is maintained at 58.0 million boxes.
The varietal divisions of 26.5 million boxes of white and 31.5 million boxes of colored are continued.
If attained, the total seedless will be 13 percent above the 51.3 million boxes recorded last season and seven percent above the recorded high 54.4 million boxes attained in the 1994-95 season.
The colored forecast exceeds the record 1994-95 crop of 28.7 million boxes by 10 percent and last season's by 12 percent.
The white variety exceeds last season by 14 percent but will not be a record.
Nine seasons in the past 20 years have been larger, with the record of 31.1 million boxes in 1979-80.
Last season the fresh pack of white was 5.9 million boxes (25 percent) of the total 23.2 million boxes and colored was 17.0 million boxes (60 percent) of the total 28.1 million.
The November survey of fruit size indicated that it would require 13 more fruit of both white and colored to fill a standard (85 pound equivalent) box than at the same time last season when fruit size was at a record high level.
However, as of the November survey the loss from droppage had been less for both varieties than any of the previous eight seasons for the same period.
Utilization is lagging behind last season, reflecting the later maturity and smaller average fruit sizes.
These forecasts are based on objective fruit count and measurement surveys in relationship to the harvest patterns and utilization of the past two seasons.
All citrus forecasts project certified utilization including a preseason allocation of less than two percent for unrecorded usage.
Certifications include only fruit actually shipped in fresh pack or recorded at a processing plant.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT 1.0 MILLION BOXES
The seedy (Duncan) grapefruit forecast is continued at 1.0 million boxes.
Last season 1.05 million boxes were recorded.
Average fruit size and loss from droppage are following the projected values made in October.
All seedy grapefruit is certified in processed form and final recorded utilization is dependent on accurate load ticket identification.
ALL TANGERINES REMAIN 6.0 MILLION BOXES
The all tangerine forecast is continued at 6.0 million boxes.
The early portion, comprised of Robinson, Fallglo, Sunburst and Dancy varieties is decreased from 4.4 million boxes to 4.2 million boxes.
Fallglo and Robinson variet ies are complete, with estimated utilization slightly under the allocated amounts.
The Sunburst fruit size projection was reduced, as growth did not attain the expected value.
The Honey tangerine portion of the crop is increased from 1.6 to 1.8 million boxes.
Fruit sizes continue to be smaller than last season but fruit loss through November was much less than any similar period on record.
This is very unusual and may reflect the later maturity of the crop.
TEMPLES REMAIN AT 2.5 MILLION BOXES
The 2.5 million box Temple forecast is continued.
The average fruit size in November was the smallest in over 20 years, reflecting the heavy fruit set.
However, accumulated percent loss from fruit droppage is less than any November in the 35 year series.
TANGELOS HELD AT 3.8 MILLION BOXES
The 3.8 million box tangelo forecast is continued.
The average fruit size is smaller than last season, as would be indicated by the heavy fruit set.
However, loss from fruit droppage, while close to last season is less than any November in the past 10 seasons.
Last season 58 percent of the record small 2.45 million box crop went into processing.
If this percent were the same this season, 2.2 million boxes would be used in processed form.
K-EARLY CITRUS 150,000 BOXES
The K-Early Citrus estimate is reduced from 200,000 boxes to 150,000 boxes.
Harvest is almost complete with 139,000 boxes certified.

FRUIT SIZE COMPARISONS BY TYPES TO PREVIOUS SEASONS
Size frequency distributions are from the November size survey conducted in sample groves during the period of November 4-27, 1996.
The distributions are by percent from fruit within the size range of each 4/5 bushel container.
These percents relate only to fruit from spring bloom and exclude summer bloom fruit in all seasons.
