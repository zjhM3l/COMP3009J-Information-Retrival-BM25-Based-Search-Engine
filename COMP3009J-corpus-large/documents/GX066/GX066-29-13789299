This is a record high forecast for Florida oranges.
The two divisions of the forecast are: early and midseason at 146.0 million boxes (including 7.5 million boxes of Navels) and late type ( Valencia) at 108.0 million boxes.
The forecast is based entirely on tree counts, fruit counts, and measurements made by the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
The forecasts project the amounts of fruit utilized in certified fresh and processing form, including about half of one percent for non-recorded fruit.
Historically, all oranges have been utilized.
The all orange forecast is 12 percent more than the 226.2 million boxes recorded last season, which was a record high crop.
During the past 10 seasons the October forecast has deviated from final recorded utilization by an average of 3.8 percent.
During this period, three of the seasons averaged 6.8 percent above and the remaining seven averaged 2.6 percent below the final estimates of utilization.
In the majority of the citrus producing area, there was heavy bloom in the "normal" March-April period.
Only in the lower western locations, affected by the one night in January below freezing, was the bloom mostly lighter and later.
Sufficient to abundant moisture occurred in most areas through mid- August.
Since then, the majority of the citrus producing areas have been drier than in most years.

The data collection and sampling procedures used in all forecasts are identical with past seasons.
These are described on page six of this report.
Bearing trees include 1994 plantings (three years old at bloom time) as recorded in the 1996 Commercial Citrus Inventory, updated by two seasons of estimated attrition.
The number of bearing trees used in this forecast is 79.5 million trees, up 1.3 percent from last season.
The average fruit per tree for all oranges is up significantly from each of the past four seasons.
In recent seasons, only in 1990 and 1992 was the average greater.
The youngest bearing age group, consisting of three through five year old trees, comprises 17 percent of the trees, as compared with 26 percent last season.
However, this age group only contributed about six percent to the total fruit population (bearing trees times average fruit per tree) compared with nine percent last season.
As fewer trees are being planted each year, the youngest age group is having less influence in total production.
All fruit having a diameter of at least 11/16 inch at count time was included in the forecast.
On the average, only 12 fruit per tree included in the counts (slightly over one percent) appeared to be of non- regular bloom (mid-April and later) and only two fruit per tree were not included in the expansions.
This summer the count survey was conducted from July 25 through September 19, 1997.
Details of the orange varietal division forecasts are explained on page two of this report.
ALL ORANGE YIELD 1.55 GALLONS The all orange FCOJ yield projection is 1.55 gallons per box of 42 degrees Brix concentrate.
This is slightly less than last season's final 1.57 gallons as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association.
A projection of early-midseason and late (Valencia) categories will be make in the January report.
All projections of yield assume processing relationships of the past several seasons.
Results of orange and grapefruit maturity testing with comparisons are found on pages three and four.
_________________________________________________________________
EARLY AND MIDSEASON 146.0 MILLION BOXES The early and midseason orange forecast is at a record high 146.0 million boxes.
This forecast is almost nine percent greater than last season.
That 134.2 million box crop was the largest utilization of record.
Excluding Navels, there is a total of 37.3 million trees used in this forecast, which is only 0.2 million trees more than last season.
The limb count sample weighted average fruit per tree (using a 25 cell age/area matrix) was almost 15 percent more than a year ago.
This is significantly more than the preceding three years but seven percent less than in 1992 and 11 percent less than in 1990.
The early portion (mostly Hamlin) constitutes 83 percent of the early- mid fruit population.
Although there are still 42 percent of the bearing trees under nine years old, they only contribute 22 percent to the fruit population.
Average fruit size in September (measured in spherical cubic inches) is only one percent less than last year but is slightly more than the past seven year average.
Loss of fruit droppage from trees (which is the only measure of loss used in forecast expansions) during the August- September period is a rounded percent more than last season's same period.
In the past seven seasons, droppage from August to harvest date has averaged 10 percent, ranging from 7.4 to 16.1 percent.
The most influential factor in droppage loss is fluctuating weather patterns.
NAVEL ORANGES
.5 MILLION BOXES Navel oranges are forecast at 7.5 million boxes (included in the total early-mid orange forecast).
This Navel crop is projected to be a record, at 1.1 million boxes more than the 6.4 million boxes last season, which was the previous record of certified production.
Bearing trees are only increased 24,000 trees more than last season, as seasonal plantings have declined.
However, fruit per tree increased by 15 percent.
This is the largest fruit set since 1992.
Even with the heavy fruit set, the September sizes are larger than average and last season, which may reflect advanced maturity.
Fruit loss from droppage is projected to harvest to be over three percent more than last season.
Droppage, through November, on this crop varies widely with an average of 17 percent and a range of 11 to 27 percent.
Because of significant differences in fruit set, size, drop, and harvest patterns of this variety from other oranges, the Navel orange forecast is computed separately from the other oranges and is used as an add-on indicator in the early-mid and all orange forecasts.
VALENCIAS
.0 MILLION BOXES The late type (Valencia) orange forecast of 108.0 million boxes is 17 percent more than last season's 92.0 million boxes.
The 1996-97 crop was the previous record high certification.
There are 39 million trees used in the forecast expansions, up 0.8 million from last season.
Fruit per tree is up 16 percent, resulting in an increased fruit population of almost 19 percent.
Trees under nine years old constitute 50 percent of the total and contributed 31 percent to the fruit population.
There is an estimated average of two percent "non-regular" bloom as compared with less than one percent last season.
The average fruit size in September is actually slightly larger than the seven year mean and last season at the same time.
The average loss from droppage through March for the past seven seasons (excluding the 30 percent factor in 1990) has been 15 percent, ranging from 11 to 19 percent.
Projected loss is at the average level.
TEMPLES
2.3 MILLION BOXES The 2.3 million box Temple forecast is down 0.1 million boxes from final certifications last season.
Both bearing trees and average fruit per tree are down from last year.
The resultant fruit population is down almost 22 percent.
However, projected fruit size to harvest would require 26 fewer fruit to make a standard box.
While more than last season, the amounts of "non-regular" and late bloom are close to average.
Also, about 25 fruit per tree were too small to be included in the forecast.
Last season 77 percent of the recorded crop went in processed form as compared with 68 percent in 1995-96.
TANGELOS
3.3 MILLION BOXES The 3.3 million box tangelo forecast is 16.5 percent less than last season.
The 3.95 million box crop recorded in 1996-97 was the largest crop since the 1987-88 season.
Forecast trees are down by 36,000 trees and average fruit per tree is down by 195 fruit from last season.
However, projection of fruit size indicates that it will require 35 fewer fruit to make a standard box.
The forecast indicates a larger crop than seven of the nine seasons since the record 4.2 million boxes in 1987-88.
Last season 74 percent of the crop went into processing, well above the 58 percent in 1995-96.

These are the second maturity tests of the 1997- 98 season for all but the late oranges.
Samples from the route surveys which cover all five major citrus producing areas were tested.
Sample size has re mained constant for several seasons but one midseason grove has been pushed since the previous survey, reducing the number of samples to 54.
The grapefruit sample size began with 100, which included 50 samples each for the white and colored types.
Five of the colored seedless groves were harvested at the time of this survey.
These samples were picked September 29 and 30 and tested October 1-2 in the Orlando test lab of the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
Only regular bloom fruit was picked for testing.
September rainfall has been variable with heavy rains along the West Coast but sparse in many other areas.
Growers have used irrigation extensively to maintain surface moisture levels.
Temperatures have been within the normal range for this time of the year.
Acid levels for all types of fruit tested are much lower than last year at the same time.
The lower acid and just about normal Brix for the first of October resulted in a higher than average ratio for all types.
Except for early oranges, pounds of unfinished juice are also higher than last year at the same time.

SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT 53.5 MILLION BOXES
The total seedless grapefruit forecast of 53.5 million boxes is 2.6 percent less than the record high final certification of 54.9 million boxes last season.
If realized, it will be 4.3 percent more than recorded in 1995-96, but 1.7 percent less than the previous high of 54.4 million boxes in 1994-95.
The varietal division is 23.0 million boxes of white and 30.5 million boxes of colored.
Both of the divisions are forecast below the certifications of last season.
The two major factors in the reductions are fewer bearing trees used in the forecast and lower average fruit per tree than last season.
From reports and observations, an increased attrition factor was applied to the 1996 Commercial Citrus Inventory bearing trees (through 1994 plantings) to account for recent tree removal and total abandonment.
White trees used for forecast expansions are down 5.2 percent and colored are down 5.3 percent from those used last season.
The white average fruit per tree was down 12.5 percent and the colored was down 11 percent.
Some normal cycling effect occurs on grapefruit after a heavy fruit set season such as last year.
However, a portion of the reduced average fruit per tree may be an effect of samples taken in some minimal care and semi-abandoned groves.
September fruit volumes used to project average fruit per box at harvest are 12 percent larger for white and 11 percent larger for colored.
Loss from fruit droppage is projected to be close to the average of recent seasons.
These forecasts are based on objective fruit count and measurement surveys in relationship to the harvest patterns and utilization of the past six seasons.
All citrus forecasts project certified utilization including a preseason allocation of less than two percent for unrecorded usage.
Certifica- tions include only fruit actually shipped in fresh pack or recorded at a processing plant.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT 500,000 BOXES The seedy (Duncan) grapefruit forecast at 500,000 boxes indicates the smallest amount of this variety ever recorded.
Last season, only 900,000 boxes were certified.
Forecast bearing trees are down almost 11 percent and the average fruit per tree is down more than 40 percent.
Fruit sizes are well above average with September fruit measurements nine percent larger than last season.
In recent seasons, the objective expansions have indicated about three times as much fruit as finally certified.
Analysis, however, has provided reasonable forecast accuracy.
All seedy grapefruit is certified in processed form and recorded utilization is dependent on load tickets.
ALL TANGERINES 5.5 MILLION BOXES The all tangerines forecast of 5.5 million boxes is down almost 13 percent from the 6.3 million boxes recorded last season.
The record high certified amount was 6.7 million boxes in 1979-80, with the Dancy and Robinson varieties totaling 3.9 million boxes and Honeys at 2.8 million boxes.
Two divisions comprise the forecast: Early--at 3.7 million boxes and Honey--at 1.8 million boxes.
Early category allocations, in million boxes, are: Robinson=0.250, Fallglo=0.650, Sunburst=2.600, and Dancy=0.200.
Sunburst is the major tangerine variety and comprises 70 percent of the Early total.
Bearing trees increased four percent from last season.
However average fruit per tree decreased by 29 percent.
It is projected that fruit sizes will be 19 percent larger than last season, with loss from fruit droppage more than the record low last season.
The most recently introduced tangerine, Fallglo, has 11 percent more bearing trees and a 21 percent increase in the average fruit per tree than last season.
Loss from fruit drop is projected to be about eight percent above last year and it will take about five more fruit to make a carton.
The Robinson variety trees decreased 10 percent but fruit per tree increased 22 percent from last season.
The last five seasons' objective count expansions have overstated this crop consistently, which was not the situation in the past.
Fruit size and loss factors are projected close to last season.
Dancy forecast trees are down 14 percent but the average fruit per tree more than doubled.
From the September average fruit size it appears that the majority of the fruit set will not make fresh size 210 at harvest.
The Honey tangerine forecast at 1.8 million boxes is the same as the final certification of last season.
There are 131,000 more bearing trees but fruit set is down by an average of 53 fruit per tree.
Projected fruit per box at harvest is 11 percent larger.
Projected loss from droppage was computed at closer to historic mean for this fruit type, than the abnormally low factor of last season.
K-EARLY AT 130,000 BOXES The K-Early Citrus Fruit forecast indicates a 13 percent decrease from the 150,000 boxes recorded last season.
Both tree numbers and fruit per tree are down this season.
LIMES 600,000 BUSHELS
The 1997-98 lime crop, first forecast in April 1997, is continued at 600,000 bushels (375,000 boxes).
This is 17 percent more than last season's 512,000 bushels (320,000 boxes).
Production is increasing as trees planted since 1992 are beginning to bear fruit.
5 _________________________________________________________________
FORECAST PROCEDURES FOR THE 1997-98 SEASON
All citrus forecasts except limes and K-Early Citrus Fruit are based on actual fruit counts and measurements.
These objective count methods utilize: (1) the bearing age tree population provided from the latest aerial photography with field verifications; (2) the average fruit per tree obtained from the fruit count survey using randomly selected trees and limbs; and (3) the fruit measurement and fruit drop count surveys to determine fruit sizes and loss from fruit droppage.
The 1996 Commercial Citrus Inventory is the base used to determine forecast tree numbers for the 1997-98 season.
All trees planted in 1994 and earlier are included.
An attrition factor by age and area was applied to these base numbers to account for tree losses since the inventory period.
The same unbiased fruit count procedures were used as in all of the past 40 seasons.
These include drawing the sample with known probabilities from the Commercial Citrus Inventory based on analyses of the variability in fruit per tree.
Using random path procedures, count limbs on sample trees are preselected to improve accuracy.
Fruit on these limbs are counted in the late July to mid September period.
Fruit size surveys were conducted in August and September.
The fruit loss surveys (drop count) were begun in August.
These surveys, along with historical records, were used to project the fruit size at harvest and the fruit population that is expected to remain on trees at harvest.
The chart below describes the relationship of the September 1997 early and midseason orange (excluding Navels) fruit size measurements with those taken in September 1996.
The diameter measurements shown are the minimum values of each eighth inch range, except for the smallest values.
FRUIT SIZE: Early and midseason oranges (excluding Navels) size frequency by diameter from September measurements.

Size frequency distributions developed from the September size survey are shown in the following table.
