The two million box increase is completely in the late type (Valencia) portion and represents a one percent increase in total oranges.
If realized, this would be the second largest utilization on record.
In the past 10 non-freeze seasons, the April forecast has differed from the final recorded utilization by an average of 1.3 percent.
EARLY AND MIDSEASONS FINAL AT 134.0 MILLION BOXES
The total early and midseason estimate of utilization for the 1999-00 season is held at 134.0 million boxes.
This estimate is 20 percent greater than last season's use but four percent less than the record crop in 1997-98.
The route (Row Count) survey, conducted on March 29-30, 2000, indicated that 98 percent of the rows were clean harvested.
The continued decreasing weekly utilization also shows that harvest of this season's crop is almost finished.
The Navel portion, within the total early and midseason oranges, is maintained at 5.4 million boxes.
Last season only 5.0 million boxes were recorded but 6.3 and 6.4 million boxes were estimated for the preceding two seasons.

VALENCIAS UP 2.0 MILLION BOXES
The late type (Valencia) forecast is raised to 94.0 million boxes.
This 2.0 million box increase is primarily the result of the abnormally small loss from fruit droppage.
The March survey indicated that this loss was the second lowest in over 30 non-freeze seasons and only slightly above the lowest that occurred in the 1995- 96 season.
Average fruit size, as represented by volume, is larger than last season and slightly larger than the mean of the past nine seasons.
Weight per fruit, from the maturity tests, is also well above average.
FCOJ 1.54 GALLONS PER BOX The estimated yield for all oranges going into FCOJ is unchanged from last month at 1.54 gallons per box of 42.0 degrees Brix concentrate.
In report No. 24 by the Florida Citrus Processors Association, the early and mid portion of the crop was final at 1.475739 gallons per box.
The projected yield for late season oranges remains the same as last month at 1.64 gallons.
Report No. 26 from the Association shows 87.8 million boxes have been utilized for all oranges, yielding 1.482293 gallons per box.
Report No. 2 for Valencias show they are yielding an average of 1.589840 gallons per box.
2000-01 LIMES 400,000 BUSHELS
The 2000-01 lime crop is forecast at 400,000 bushels (250,000 88lb. boxes).
The just completed 1999- 2000 season total estimate of utilization is 960,000 bushels (600,000 boxes).
See page 4 for more details.

SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT HELD AT 45.5 MILLION BOXES
The total seedless grapefruit forecast is held at 45.5 million boxes.
White seedless is continued at 18.5 million boxes and the colored varieties remain at 27.0 million.
These are the same as forecasts made in November 1999 following a special survey to determine loss from Hurricane Irene.
The March surveys to measure fruit sizing and droppage confirm the level of the forecasts.
Both types continue to show sizes smaller than last season and the nine season average.
Average droppage adjusted for storm loss is slightly below average for whites and slightly above for colored varieties.
The route survey (Row Count) conducted on March 29 and 30 indicates the heavy harvest in March.
Maturity of fruit is lagging as it has all season.
The survey shows 60 percent of the white seedless rows harvested as compared to over 75 percent last season and 75 percent of the colored rows which is about the same as last season.
Spot picking for sizes and early bloom fruit has been more prevalent this season.
It is also reported that processed fruit loads are requiring more pieces of fruit to make an 85 pound box than in other seasons.
Picking of white and colored seedless for processing is increasing as plants have now finished early-midseason oranges.
Report number 26 from the Citrus Administrative Committee, with utilization through April 2, shows fresh shipments behind the last two seasons with weekly movement beginning to decline.
Weekly processing movement is increasing as more fruit is going directly to the processors.
Demand is strong for juice fruit this season and complete utilization of grapefruit is expected.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT REMAIN 500,000 BOXES
The seedy (Duncan) grapefruit forecast remains at 500,000 boxes.
The April Row Count survey indicates almost 60 percent of the rows harvested.
Most of this variety is located in the interior and West Coast areas of the State and all of it goes into processing channels.
Weekly utilization has increased and harvest will progress rapidly.
Total utilization through April 2 is estimated at 372,000 boxes.
Only 550,000 boxes were recorded last season.
Final recording of the crop has been less than 1.0 million boxes for the past three seasons.
ALL TANGERINES 6.8 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of all tangerines is continued at 6.8 million boxes with 4.4 million boxes apportioned to the early tangerines ( Robinson, Fallglo, Dancy and Sunburst varieties) and 2.4 million boxes of Honey tangerines.
Harvest is over for the early varieties except Sunburst which continues to be used for processing.
Weekly certifications of Honey tangerines have been steady with the majority of the fruit certified for fresh use.
Approximately two-thirds of the rows along the routes used for Row Count were harvested following the survey March 29-30.
These results in conjunction with utilization of 1.7 million boxes through March 30 support the current forecast.
If realized, this crop would be 26 percent larger than last season and surpassed only by the record 2.8 million boxes recorded in 1979-80.
TEMPLES REMAIN 2.1 MILLION BOXES
The Temple forecast of 2.1 million boxes is carried forward and remains unchanged from the initial forecast in October 1999.
A crop this size would be the third smallest since the record high of 6.0 million boxes in 1979-80 but almost 17 percent larger than the previous season's 1.8 million boxes and 50 percent greater than the freeze affected season of 1989-90.
With estimated certifications over 1.7 million boxes and over 80 percent of the rows harvested, the Row Count survey confirms the current forecast.
TANGELOS CUT TO 2.2 MILLION BOXES
Although the April Row Count survey indicated a small number of rows remaining for harvest, it appears that harvest of this variety is complete.
The reduction of 300,000 boxes aligns the forecast with current utilization with an allocation for non-certified fruit.
This crop, almost 14 percent smaller than last season and 23 percent smaller than 1997-98, is less than one-third the size of the record 6.4 million boxes recorded in 1979-80.
K-EARLY CITRUS 110,000 BOXES
The K-Early harvest is complete at 110,000 boxes, about 25 percent below the average of the past ten seasons but higher than the smallest crops which occurred the past two seasons when production fell below 100,000 boxes.
Most of this crop was processed.
The production high of 600,000 boxes was recorded for three consecutive seasons beginning in 1978-79.

2000-01 LIMES FORECAST AT 400,000 BUSHELS
Florida's 2000-01 lime crop, which began harvest April 1, is forecast at 400,000 bushels (250,000 88-pound boxes).
If attained, this will be almost 60 percent less than last season's utilization of 960,000 bushels (600,000 boxes).
Hurricane Andrew reduced the size of the 1992-93 season crop and production reached a low of only 320,000 bushels in the following season.
Trees planted after the storm have been producing good crops of limes and production has rebounded with successive increases.
The primary reason for the reduction in this season's forecast of utilization is the destruction of about half of the trees in Dade County.
By April, the Division of Plant Industry, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, reported that 1,144 acres of trees were destroyed because of the presence of or exposure to Xanthomonas (citrus canker).
An additional 327 acres had been identified as positive for Xanthomonas and are slated for destruction.
The total of 1,471 acres is about half of the estimated 2,900 total acres in Dade County.
A complete census of lime trees has not been conducted since 1996 when the State total acreage was 3,168 acres.
Trees and acres in counties other than Dade are not expected to produce commercial quantities of fruit.
Remaining trees in Dade County experienced a good bloom and volume harvest is expected by June.
The realization of this forecast of 400,000 bushels is dependant on not losing any more trees to canker.
Subsequent surveys for the disease are being planned and may affect the total crop output.
