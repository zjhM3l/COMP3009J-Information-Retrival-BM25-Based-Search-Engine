CITRUS OCTOBER FORECAST MATURITY TEST RESULTS AND FRUIT SIZE October 11, 1996 Florida Agricultural Statistics Service | 1222 Woodward Street | Orlando, Florida 32803 | 407 / 648-6013 _________________________________________________________________ FORECAST DATES 1996-97 SEASON November 12, 1996 December 12, 1996 ORANGES 220.0 MILLION BOXES The 1996-97 Florida total orange forecast (excluding Temples), released today by the USDA Agricultural Statistics Board, is 220.0 million boxes.
This is a record high forecast for Florida oranges.
Comprising this forecast are 130.0 million boxes of early and midseason oranges (including a record high 6.5 million boxes of Navels) and 90.0 million boxes of late type (Valencia) oranges.
The forecast is based entirely on tree counts, fruit counts, and measurements made by the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
The forecasts project the amounts of fruit utilized in certified fresh and processing form, including less than half of one percent for non-recorded fruit.
Historically, all oranges have been utilized.
The all orange forecast is 8.3 percent above last season's 203.2 million boxes.
The forecast is 6.4 percent more than the 206.7 million box record utilization in the 1979-80 season, which occurred prior to the major freezes of the 1980's.
During the past 10 non-freeze seasons, the October all orange forecasts have deviated from final recorded utilization by an average of 4.6 percent.
During this period, four of the seasons averaged 7.8 percent more and the remaining six, 2.6 percent lower than the final estimate of utilization.
The major bloom occurred during the "normal" March-April period and appeared to be mostly uniform and profuse.
Moisture levels were very good through June and, like the last two seasons, there were very few later bloom fruit recorded during the count survey.
July and August were considerably drier than the last two seasons.

The data collection and sampling techniques used in all forecasts are identical with past seasons.
These are described on page six of this report.
Bearing trees include 1993 plantings (three years old at bloom time) and are those shown in the Commercial Citrus Tree Inventory preliminary report released September 13, 1996, updated by one season of estimated attrition.
The number of bearing trees for the 1996-97 season orange forecast is 78.5 million trees, up 4.2 percent from the 75.3 million trees producing last season's crop.
Although the average fruit per tree for all oranges is up from both the past two seasons it is below the levels of 1992-93 and 1993-94.
Fruit sizes at harvest are projected to be smaller than last season in all varietal divisions.
The youngest bearing age group, consisting of three through five year old trees, comprises 26 percent of the total, compared with 30 percent last season.
However, this age group only accounted for nine percent of the fruit population (bearing trees times average fruit per tree) compared with 12 percent last season.
On average, only three fruit per tree included in the counts appeared to be of non-regular (mid-April and later) bloom, and less than one fruit per tree was not included in the forecast.
This year, the count period extended from July 29 through September 20, 1996, and all of the fruit of at least 11/16 inch in diameter at count time was included in the expansions.
Details of the varietal division forecasts are explained on page two of this report.
FCOJ 1.53 GALLONS PER BOX The 1996-97 projection of all orange FCOJ yield is 1.53 gallons per box of concentrate at 42.0 degrees Brix.
This is slightly higher than last season's final of 1.522516 gallons as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association.
A projection by early- midseason and Valencia categories will be made in the January report.
Projections assume similar relationships of past seasons, including the processing changes of 1992-93.
Results of orange and grapefruit maturity testing with comparisons are found on pages three and four.
_________________________________________________________________
EARLY AND MIDSEASON 130.0 MILLION BOXES The total early and midseason orange forecast is at a record high level of 130.0 million boxes.
This forecast is seven percent greater than last season, which was the largest utilization of record.
Excluding Navels, there is a total of 37.1 million trees used in this forecast, a three percent increase from the trees producing the 1995-96 crop.
The weighted average fruit per tree is six percent more than last season, but well below the levels of 1992-93 and 1993-94.
The early portion (mostly Hamlin) constitutes 82 percent of the early-midseason fruit population.
Bearing trees less than six years old constitute 24 percent of the total, but contribute less than eight percent to the fruit population.
Average fruit size in September was at the mean level for all of the 35 years of historic data and is projected to mean value at harvest.
This is about 11 percent less in volume than last season.
Loss by fruit droppage from trees (which is the only measure of loss recorded) is at the level of last season, but less than the historic series average.
In the past 14 non- freeze seasons, droppage from August to harvest date has averaged 10 percent, ranging from 7.6 to 16.1 percent.
NAVEL ORANGES
.5 MILLION BOXES Navel oranges at 6.5 million boxes are included in the early and midseason orange forecast.
The Navel crop is projected to be a record, 25 percent greater than last season's 5.2 million boxes and 12 percent above the 5.8 million boxes certified in 1994-95, the largest crop of record.
Bearing trees, at 3.16 million, are only up 197,000 trees.
However, fruit per tree is 21 percent greater than last season.
Fruit size is projected to be at the historic mean at harvest, requiring an average of about two more fruit to fill a 4/5- bushel carton than last season.
Fruit loss from droppage is projected to be slightly more than last season, but below the historic average through November.
Because of significant differences in fruit set, size, drop, and harvest patterns of this variety from other oranges, the Navel orange forecast is computed separately from the other oranges and is used as an add-on indicator in the early-mid and all orange forecasts.
VALENCIAS
.0 MILLION BOXES The late type (Valencia) orange forecast of 90.0 million boxes, is projected to exceed the 88.8 million box record high utilization in 1979-80.
The forecast is almost 10 percent more than the 82.0 million boxes utilized last season.
There are 38.2 million bearing trees used for this season's forecast, up five percent from last season.
Fruit per tree is almost 11 percent more than the lowest average on record shown last season.
However, the mean fruit set is still below the averge set of the past five seasons.
The advent of many new bearing trees has been a major factor in keeping Valencia fruit per tree lower than historic averages.
The youngest age group comprises almost 27 percent of the bearing trees but contributes only 11 percent to the fruit population.
Once again less than one percent of the counted fruit came from later than normal bloom.
The average fruit size is projected to round to the 11 non- freeze season mean, but slightly smaller than last season.
Loss from fruit droppage has a history of more variability than early-midseason, even in non-freeze seasons, because of longer duration to
harvest from August
.
This season, loss is projected over three prercent more than last season but about one percent less than average.
There has been an almost eight percent range of percent loss to harvest during the past five seasons, which is much narrower than a longer time series.
TEMPLES
.5 MILLION BOXES The 2.5 million box Temple forecast is 16 percent more than recorded last season but at the level of the 1990-91, 1992-93, and 1994-95 seasons.
Bearing tree numbers are down slightly, however, fruit set is up 45 percent.
While fruit size is projected to be 17 percent smaller than in 1995-96, the crop has far less "non-regular" and late bloom than usual.
Less than two percent of the fruit fell into those categories as compared with seven percent last season.
An average of only four counted fruit per tree was too small to be included in the forecast.
Last season 67 percent of the Temple crop was used for processing.
TANGELOS
.8 MILLION BOXES The 3.8 million box tangelo forecast indicates a larger crop than any season since 1988-89.
This forecast is 55 percent more than the 2.45 million boxes recorded last season, which was the smallest crop in the past 25 seasons.
There are only 32,000 more bearing trees than those that produced last season's crop.
Fruit set is almost twice as much as last season.
Projected fruit size at harvest is close to the historic mean but much smaller than the very large sizes of the past two seasons.
Projected loss from droppage is about two percent more than last season.
In 1995-96, processed fruit totaled 1.4 million boxes representing 58 percent of the crop.

MATURITY
These are the first maturity tests of the 1996- 97 season.
These tests are sub-samples from the route surveys which cover all 5 major citrus producing areas.
There are 120 early orange samples, 55 midseason samples, and 150 Valencia samples.
The grapefruit sample size continues at an even 100, including 50 samples each for the white and colored types.
Samples were picked September 30 and October 1 and tested October 2 and 3 in the Orlando test lab of the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
Only regular bloom fruit was picked for testing.
The bloom again this season was just about normal.
The bloom lasted from mid-March to the second week of April when the bloom period was virtually completed.
The weather was about normal this summer with lots of general rain, a few dry periods, and again many hard rains and thunderstorms.
The East Coast used irrigation during late August and September while some of the southern counties were wet.
Pounds solids per box and percent solids for all fruit types tested are ahead of last year at this time.
However, pounds of unfinished juice per box for the three major round orange types is lagging behind last year.
The current lagging maturity is shown in higher percent acid for all types tested.

SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT 58.0 MILLION BOXES The all seedless grapefruit forecast of 58.0 million boxes is a record high projection, seven percent above the record of 54.4 million boxes in 1994-95.
The varietal division is 26.5 million boxes of white and 31.5 million boxes of colored.
If the colored forecast is attained, it will exceed the record 1994-95 crop of 28.7 million boxes by 10 percent and last season's by 12 percent.
The white variety will exceed last season by 14 percent but will not be a record.
Nine seasons in the past 20 years have been larger, with the record of 31.1 million boxes in 1979-80.
These forecasts are based on objective fruit count and measurement surveys in relationship to the harvest patterns and utilization of the past two seasons.
All citrus forecasts project certified utilization including a preseason allocation of less than two percent for unrecorded usage.
Certifications include only fruit actually shipped in fresh pack or recorded at a processing plant.
A proration of the forecasts (in millions of boxes) by production areas, based on fruit populations follows:
Production Area 1995-96 1996-97 White Colored White Colored Indian River (MD II) 13.8 18.9 17.0 22.7 Southern 4.3 6.2 4.8 5.4 Other 5.1 3.0 4.7 3.4
The possible differences between growing areas, concerning average fruit size, loss from droppage and harvest patterns, can alter the prorated estimates.
White seedless bearing trees increased less than three percent and average fruit per tree is up 27 percent from the very low average last season.
The projected fruit size at harvest is identical to a 25-season mean.
This is over 17 percent less than last season's record large average size.
Loss from droppage is expected to be about one percent more than last season.
Almost three quarters of the 23.2 million box crop went to processing last season.
The combination of a five percent increase in colored seedless bearing trees and a 20 percent increase in fruit set above the record low of last season is the reason for the record high forecast.
The projection of about four percent greater loss from droppage to harvest and over 11 percent smaller average fruit size from the record high of 1995-96 reduces the effect of the increase in fruit population.
Last season 60 percent (17 million boxes) of the 28.1 million boxes were shipped fresh.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT The seedy (Duncan) grapefruit forecast is 1.0 million boxes.
Last season and in the 1993-94 season 1.05 million boxes were recorded.
Bearing trees number 6,000 fewer than last season.
The limb count survey indicates an average of 108 more pieces of fruit per tree.
However, loss from droppage is projected to be 5 percent greater and fruit size 16 percent less than last season.
All seedy grapefruit is certified in processed form and recorded utilization is dependent on load tickets.
ALL TANGERINES 6.0 MILLION BOXES
The all tangerine forecast of 6.0 million boxes is up 33 percent from the 4.5 million boxes certified in 1995-96.
Two categories comprise the forecast: early tangerines at 4.4 million boxes and Honey tangerines at 1.6 million boxes.
Early category allocations are: Robinson--0.4 million boxes, Fallglo--0.7 million boxes, Sunburst--3.2 million boxes, and Dancy--0.1 million boxes.
The largest all tangerine crop of 6.7 million boxes was recorded in 1979-80 with Dancys at 3.9 million boxes and Honeys at 2.8 million boxes.
Sunburst has quickly become the major tangerine variety and equals over 2.5 times the other early varieties.
Bearing trees increased 16 percent from last season and fruit per tree is up 48 percent.
Projected loss from drop to harvest is slightly less than last season.
However, it is projected that it will take about 14 more fruit to make a 95 pound equivalent box.
The newest tangerine, Fallglo, is forecast to be 84 percent higher than last season.
Bearing tree numbers swelled 73 percent and fruit per tree increased 47 percent.
Fruit size is projected to average about 3 percent smaller.
Because of early harvest, loss from droppage is minimal on this crop.
The Robinson variety is estimated to be 60 percent more than last season.
Although there are only a few more bearing trees, fruit set is up almost 80 percent over the low average last season.
It is projected that it will take about 17 percent more fruit to make a 95 pound equivalent box.
There was no change in Dancy bearing trees and fruit set is down more than 14 percent.
This forecast is down 38 percent from last season when only 0.16 million boxes were recorded.
The Honey tangerine forecast at 1.6 million boxes equals last season's certifications.
There are 186,000 more bearing trees.
Fruit set is down an average of 87 fruit per tree.
Loss is projected to be less than the 50 percent that has occurred from August to harvest in some seasons.
Sizes are slightly smaller than last season.
K-EARLYS 200,000 BOXES
The K-Early Citrus Fruit forecast reflects a 25 percent increase from the 160,000 boxes recorded last season.
This would be an increase for the second season and nearly equals the level attained in the 1993-94 season.
LIMES 600,000 BUSHELS The 1996-97 lime crop, first forecast in April 1996, is continued at 600,000 bushels (375,000 boxes).
This is 25 percent more than last season's total production of 480,000 bushels (300,000 boxes).
Production has increased yearly since the low of 200,000 boxes in the 1993-94 season following the hurricane in August 1992.
_________________________________________________________________
FORECAST PROCEDURES FOR THE 1996-97 SEASON
All citrus forecasts except limes and K-Early Citrus Fruit are based on actual fruit counts and measurements.
These objective count methods utilize: (1) the bearing age tree population provided from the latest aerial photography with field verifications; (2) the average fruit per tree obtained from the fruit count survey using randomly selected trees and limbs; and (3) the fruit measurement and fruit drop count surveys to determine fruit sizes and loss from fruit droppage.
The 1996 Commercial Citrus Inventory is the base used to determine forecast tree numbers for the 1996-97 season.
All trees planted in 1993 and earlier are included.
An attrition factor by age and area was applied to these base numbers to account for tree losses since the inventory period.
The same unbiased fruit count procedures were used as in all of the past 39 seasons.
These include drawing the sample with known probabilities from the Commercial Citrus Inventory based on analyses of the variability in fruit per tree.
Using random path procedures, count limbs on sample trees are preselected to improve accuracy.
Fruit on these limbs are counted in the late July to mid September period.
Fruit size surveys were conducted in August and September.
The fruit loss surveys (drop count) were begun in August.
These surveys, along with historical records, were used to project the fruit size at harvest and the fruit population that is expected to remain on trees at harvest.
The chart below describes the relationship of the September 1996 early and midseason orange (excluding Navels) fruit size measurements with those taken in September 1995.
The diameter measurements shown are the minimum values of each eighth inch range, except for the smallest values.
FRUIT SIZE: Early and midseason oranges (excluding Navels) size frequency by diameter from September measurements.
chart: early-midseason orange size frequency
Size frequency distributions developed from the September size survey are shown in the following table.
