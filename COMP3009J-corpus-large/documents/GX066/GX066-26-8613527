The route survey conducted May 1-2 confirms this change.
This forecast includes a final estimate for the early and midseason oranges (including Navels) of 128.0 million boxes and a revised estimate for the late season Valencia oranges of 98.0 million boxes.
Despite the reduction of nearly one percent, this orange crop will be the fourth largest on record if attained, falling seven percent below the 1997-98 record of 244.0 million boxes, three percent below the 233.0 million boxes in 1999-00, and just 200,000 boxes below the 1996-97 recorded crop.
In the past 10 seasons, the May forecast has been above the final utilization three times and below seven times.
EARLY-MIDSEASON ORANGES FINAL AT 128.0 MILLION BOXES
Harvest of these varieties (including Navel oranges) is complete.
Certifications combined with an allowance for non-certified gift fruit and other use total 128.0 million boxes.
Although two percent below the initial forecast released in October, this crop equals last season's and ties for fourth largest on record.
The Navel portion of the crop at 5.5 million boxes surpasses the output of the previous three seasons and is the fourth largest crop.
VALENCIAS DOWN TO 98.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of Valencia oranges is reduced 2.0 million boxes from the initial forecast maintained since October
.
Results of the monthly route survey indicate over 61 percent of the crop harvested and support this reduction.
If realized, this crop will be nearly three percent more than last season's utilization but 1.0 million boxes less than in 1999-00 and 6.0 million boxes below the record 104.0 million boxes of 1997-98.
Warmer weather earlier than usual coupled with a lack of moisture has had an adverse effect on fruit size and has accelerated droppage.
Objective count measurements taken in late April show fruit size increased only slightly from the previous month and remains below the mean of the past 11 seasons.
Although the droppage rate increased more steeply in the past month, and is higher than in the previous two seasons, it remains below the 10-season mean.
FCOJ CONTINUED AT 1.58 GALLONS
The projected all orange FCOJ yield is unchanged from last month at 1.58 gallons per box of 42.0 degrees Brix concentrate.
As of April 27, 2002, the average yield for all oranges going into concentrate was 1.563584 gallons per box as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association (FCPA).
This report also states that 177.5 million boxes of oranges have been processed so far this season, of which 112.2 million boxes have been used for concentrate.
The projected season average yield for the late type (Valencia) oranges is unchanged from last month at 1.68 gallons per box.
The latest report from the FCPA shows the Valencia season average yield at 1.651627 gallons.
The early and midseason orange yield was final at 1.527736 gallons per box as reported by the FCPA on report number 26.
Results of the latest maturity testing of fruit remaining to be harvested appear on page three of this report.

GRAPEFRUIT HELD AT 47.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of all varieties of grapefruit for recorded utilization stays at 47.0 million boxes (including a preseason allocation of 1.5 million boxes of gift fruit and other use).
The forecast continues to be divided into 19.0 million boxes of total white grapefruit and 28.0 million boxes of colored grapefruit.
If the forecast amount is harvested, it will be two percent more than recorded last season, 12 percent below the 53.4 million boxes in 1999-00, and at the level of the 1998-99 crop.
The largest recorded crop of all varieties of grapefruit was 55.8 million boxes in 1996-97 which excluded 6.0 million boxes of estimated economic abandonment.
The route survey ( Row Count ) conducted on May 1-2, 2002, shows the percent of survey rows harvested ahead of last season but close to the percent of May 1, 1999.
This season more than 90 percent of the white and more than 80 percent of the colored rows have been clean harvested.
The percent harvest of white is very close to the past 10 seasons' average.
However, the percent harvest of colored is four percentage points less than the 10-season average for the same time period.
Analysis of the data, based on the 10-season regression, indicates that there is sufficient availability to attain the forecast levels.
Estimated certification through May 5, 2002, based on Report #30 of the Citrus Administrative Committee, shows that both varieties have more utilization than last season at the same date.
Processed use is ahead of last season and fresh movement is very close.
ALL TANGERINES TOTAL 6.6 MILLION BOXES
The combination of early tangerines and the later maturing Honey tangerine variety is unchanged at 6.6 million boxes.
This forecast is 18 percent more than was recorded last season and only 6 percent less than the record crop of 1999-00.
Both of the categories had minor adjustments made within the total.
EARLY TANGERINE CATEGORY FINAL AT 4.35 MILLION BOXES
The 2001-02 early tangerine crop, consisting of Robinson, Fallglo, Sunburst, and Dancy, is estimated at 4.35 million boxes, up 22 percent from last season's 3.55 million box crop, the same amount as in 1999-00, and slightly below the recent record of 4.5 million boxes in 1996-97.
The Sunburst variety constituted 81 percent of the total and Fallglo accounted for 17 percent.
Robinson and Dancy usage has declined rapidly over the years.
HONEY TANGERINES AT 2.25 MILLION BOXES
The later maturing Honey tangerine forecast is adjusted downward to 2.25 million boxes.
Harvest has declined to a few thousand boxes per week.
This amount is 10 percent more than recorded last season but 15 percent below the record large crop of 2.650 million boxes in 1999-00.
It is possible that a limited volume of late bloom fruit may be harvested during the next few weeks.
TEMPLES ADJUSTED TO 1.55 MILLION BOXES
The Temple estimate of utilization, including 0.1 million boxes of unrecorded gift fruit and other use, is increased by 0.05 million boxes to 1.55 million boxes.
Recent weekly certifications of processed later bloom fruit necessitated the increase.
This crop is 24 percent above last season's 1.25 million boxes but 21 percent less than utilized in 1999-00.
Nearly seventy-five percent of the crop has been used in processed form.
TANGELOS FINAL AT 2.15 MILLION BOXES
The tangelo final estimate for the 2001-02 season is 2.15 million boxes, including 0.2 million boxes of pre- allocated other uses.
This amount is only 50,000 boxes more than the 2.1 million boxes last season, which was the smallest crop since 1968-69.
The record large crop was 6.4 million boxes in 1979-80.
The latest Row Count shows that close to 15 percent of the rows remain unharvested.
K-EARLY CITRUS FRUIT AT 30,000 BOXES
The 2001-02 K-Early Citrus Fruit final estimate of utilization is 30,000 boxes.
This is the smallest crop of record.
