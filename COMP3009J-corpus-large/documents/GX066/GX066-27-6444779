This is three percent larger than the 223.3 million boxes recorded as final production last season and five percent below the record high production of 244.0 million boxes utilized in the 1997-98 season.
The two forecast categories are early and midseason at 131.0 million boxes (including 5.6 million boxes of Navels) and late type (Valencia) at 100.0 million boxes.
All forecasts are based entirely on tree counts, fruit counts, and fruit measurements made by the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
The analysis of these factors project the quantity of fruit to be utilized during the current season, including about one percent for non-certified use.
Historically, no measurable loss of oranges due to economic reasons has occurred.
The October all orange forecasts during the past 10 seasons have differed from the final recorded utilization by an average of 3.6 percent.
Seasonal differences range from 9.4 percent below in 1999-00 to 7.5 percent above in 2000-01.
Three of the 10 seasons have been above the final and seven have been below.
Temperatures during December 2000 and January 2001were much cooler than in recent years.
Below freezing temperatures occurred in most producing areas in the period between December 31 and January 6.
Temperatures were sufficiently low to cause ice in fruit in exposed locations.
Statewide, loss of bearing surface was minimal.
The remainder of the winter and spring was exceptionally dry in all producing areas.
Irrigation continued in most areas enabling a relatively heavy spring bloom in most groves.
Rains started in late June, varying in amounts and locations and all were beneficial.
"Non-regular" bloom fruit in the forecast averages less than two percent of the fruit counted.
July and later blooms (not in the forecast) varied, but the average was only about three fruit per sample tree.
Bearing trees include 1998 plantings (three years old at bloom time) as shown in the 2000 Commercial Citrus Inventory, updated by two seasons of attrition.
This season, 77.4 million trees, down almost three percent from the trees used last season, are used to expand the objective count data.
The increased attrition rates used reflect the loss of bearing trees, mostly because of the effects of tristeza and other diseases.
The average fruit per tree (excluding Navels) is up two percent from last year's fruit count period.
Combined with bearing trees, this indicates that the fruit population of both seasons are nearly the same.
Fruit sizes are larger than last season, which accounts for the increase in the forecast.
Partially because of the lack of rain last season, the youngest bearing age group now contributes only 2.7 percent of the total fruit population, while the age group of 1988-1992 plant dates contributes the most at 33.6 percent.
The forecast procedures used in all forecasts are identical with past seasons.
These are described on page six of this report.

FCOJ YIELD 1.55 GALLONS PER BOX
The all orange FCOJ yield projection is 1.55 gallons per box of 42 degrees Brix concentrate.
This is slightly lower than last season's 1.58 gallons per box final yield as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association.
Final yield for the 1999-00 season was 1.55 gallons and 1.63 in 1998-99.
A separate projection for fruit going into the early-midseason category and for Valencias will be made in the January release.
All projections of yield assume the processing relationships of the past several seasons.
Results of the latest maturity testing with comparisons are found on pages three and four.
__________________________________________________________________
EARLY AND MIDSEASON 131.0 MILLION BOXES
The early and midseason orange forecast (including Navels) is 131.0 million boxes.
The forecast is two percent more than last season's utilization of 128.0 million boxes but six percent less than the record use of 140.0 million boxes in 1997-98.
Excluding Navels, 34.3 million trees are used to compute this forecast, down four percent from the trees used in last season's computation.
The average fruit per tree (weighted by the 25 cell age/area matrix) is two percent more than last season.
Only one percent of the fruit used in the forecast is of a "non-regular" configuration.
The Western area has the largest average fruit per tree.
The combination of the Western and Central areas contributes 62 percent to the fruit population.
The early portion (mostly Hamlins) is 81 percent of the early-mid total fruit population.
Average fruit size in September (measured in spherical cubic inches) was nine percent larger than a year ago but four percent below the 10 season mean.
Growth rates between August and September have been average.
It is projected that it will take 19 less fruit to make a 90 pound equivalent box at harvest.
Loss from fruit droppage prior to harvest is projected to be less than the 10 season average.
Droppage from the tree is the only loss factor measured and is relative to the other seasons for analysis.
The loss factor indicator can vary because of subsequent weather conditions.
NAVEL ORANGES 5.6 MILLION BOXES
Significant differences in fruit set, size, drop and harvest patterns of this variety necessitate a separate expansion to be used as an add-on in the early-midseason and all orange forecast.
The Navel orange forecast is 5.6 million boxes.
The projection is 10 percent more than was realized last season (including slightly less than 1.0 million boxes of unrecorded gift fruit and other use).
The record high crop was 6.4 million boxes in 1996-97, followed by 6.3 million boxes in 1997-98.
Bearing tree numbers are down 11 percent but the average fruit per tree is up 20 percent.
Fruit sizes in September were larger than last year but slightly below normal.
Loss from droppage is projected to be almost two percent more than last season.
This variety usually has less later bloom fruit than other oranges and only an average of two fruit per tree are in this category.
VALENCIAS 100.0 MILLION BOXES
The 100.0 million box late type orange (Valencia) forecast is five percent larger than last season but four percent less than the record high crop of 104.0 million boxes recorded in the 1997-98 season.
The forecast indicates the second largest crop of record.
Over one and one-half million 1998 (three year old) plantings were added to the Valencia tree population for a total of 40.6 million trees used in this season's objective count expansions.
However, the attrition factor applied to last season indicated that there are one-half million fewer bearing trees than last season.
Tristeza and other factors have contributed to considerable tree removal and non-productivity.
Average fruit per tree is two percent higher than last season.
Although down from last season's 38 percent, the Southern Area continues to lead with 32 percent of the Valencia fruit population.
The 9 through 13 year old age trees have the largest fruit population on a statewide basis.
The September fruit size average for all regular bloom fruit (measured in cubic inches) was eight percent larger than last year.
The average was at the 10 year mean.
The growth rate between August and September was also near the mean.
It is projected that it will take eight fewer pieces to equal the 90 pound equivalent box standard.
Loss from fruit droppage projected to the harvest date is slightly below the 10 season mean.
This relative seasonal loss factor has varied, during the period between about 11 percent to almost 20 percent.
There have been four seasons above 15 percent and six seasons below.
The loss factor in recent season has been relatively in most recent season, mainly because extensive irrigation has kept trees out of stress.
TEMPLES 1.4 MILLION BOXES
The Temple forecast of 1.4 million boxes is nearly 12 percent larger than the 1.250 million boxes of certified utilization from last season.
This forecast, if realized, would be the second smallest Temple crop since the series began in the 1953-54 season.
Bearing trees are down nearly 18.5 percent.
The average fruit per tree is up a little over 8 percent.
This season's crop has very little off or "late" bloom fruit which is unusual for Temples.
Fruit sizes are below arverage and expected to be so at harvest.
Although loss from droppage is below the level of recent seasons, it is projected to be above average at harvest.
TANGELOS 2.3 MILLION BOXES
The 2.3 million box forecast is 9.5 percent or 200,000 boxes more than the 2.1 million boxes recorded last season.
This forecast indicates the third smallest tangelo crop since the 1968-69 season.
Bearing trees declined almost 16 percent, however average fruit per tree increased this season by 13 percent over last year.
Fruit sizes, larger than in recent seasons, are projected to be above the 10 year average at harvest.
Fruit loss from droppage is projected to be the third lowest in the past 10 seasons.
There is very little late bloom in this year's tangelo crop.
K-EARLY CITRUS 50,000 BOXES
The K-Early Citrus Fruit forecast of 50,000 boxes is 10,000 more than was recorded last season.
Bearing trees have been reduced almost 8 percent due to normal attrition and the Citrus Tristeza Virus.
Tree numbers continue to decline as new plantings are rare.
Very little, if any, fresh fruit was utilized in the past few years making this crop very dependent on the acceptance by the processing industry.

MATURITY
These are the results of the second maturity tests of the 2001-02 season for all but the late oranges, which were tested for the first time.
The samples tested are from groves fronting routes which cover all five major citrus producing areas.
Sample sizes have remained constant for the past several seasons.
The grapefruit sample size was 100 at the start of this season, which included 50 samples each for the white and colored types.
One colored and one white grapefruit sample had been picked at the time of this survey.
None of the 325 orange samples were harvested.
These samples were collected October 1-2, and tested October 3-5 in the Orlando test laboratory of the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
Only regular bloom fruit was tested.
Slightly more off bloom fruit than usual is present this season and this fruit could affect maturity levels if harvested.
Rainfall during the summer months was generally at or above normal for the entire summer.
The coastal and southern citrus producing counties recorded rainfall well above average all summer long.
September was a very wet month due to rains associated with Tropical Storm Danielle.
Ditches, canals, ponds, lakes, and water reservoirs were refilled this summer following two very dry years.
Maturity levels are ahead of the past three seasons for October 1.
Pounds solids for early oranges are the highest since the 1991-92 season when the solids were 4.82 pounds.
The pounds solids for midseason oranges are the highest since the 1996-97 season and Valencia's pounds solids are as high as in the 1997-98 season.
Fresh fruit packing houses have been packing and shipping Hamlin and Ambersweet oranges, white and colored grapefruit, and Fallglo and Robinson tangerines.
Virtually all of this fruit has come from the southern and interior parts of the citrus belt.

ALL GRAPEFRUIT 48.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of grapefruit for certified utilization (including an allocation of 1.5 million boxes of gift fruit and local sales) is 48.0 million boxes.
If realized, this will be two million boxes or four percent more than the previous season's 46.0 million boxes.
However, this will be ten percent less than the 53.4 million boxes harvested in the 1999-00 season.
The forecast consists of 20.0 million boxes of white grapefruit and 28.0 million of colored varieties.

In 1999, the Citrus Crop Estimates Advisory Committee requested that, in any season in which economic abandonment of a crop is anticipated, an estimate of the total available crop also be reported.
No economic abandonment of the white varieties is anticipated this season.
However, expansions indicate the availability of an additional 3.0 million boxes of colored varieties if the entire crop is utilized.
This projection is based on assumptions of economic conditions at the present time which could change as the season progresses.
Using the 2000 Commercial Citrus Inventory with assumed attrition rates and a special grapefruit tree survey in St Lucie and Indian River counties, white grapefruit bearing trees are estimated at 3.882 million.
This is nine percent less than last season's estimated trees and reflects high rates of loss to disease, the dry weather conditions of last season, and a high abandonment rate.
Fruit set (average fruit per tree) is almost nine percent greater than last season.
Droppage rates are anticipated to be slightly higher than last season, and near normal.
Fruit sizes are slightly larger at this time than the three previous seasons and are expected to be near the ten year average by harvest.
There is very little true "late" bloom fruit this season.
Colored grapefruit bearing trees are estimated at 6.921 million, six percent less than last season.
Fruit per tree is ten percent higher than last season and the highest since the 1992-93 season.
Although droppage is low at this time, the average at harvest is expected to be ten percent, higher than last season but lower then the previous three.
Average fruit sizes are larger than the last three seasons and are expected to be the largest at harvest since the 1997-98 season.
Approximately two percent of the fruit this season is from a later bloom, but only a small amount is in the true "late" bloom category.

ALL TANGERINES 7.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast for all varieties of tangerines is 7.0 million boxes which equals the record production of 1999-00 and is 25 percent greater than last season's 5.6 million boxes, the second largest crop on record.
Components of this forecast are the early tangerines at 4.8 million boxes and the later maturing Honey variety at 2.2 million boxes.
Contributing to the Early tangerines are the predominate Sunburst variety representing nearly 80 percent of the crop, followed by Fallglo with over 15 percent, with the Robinson and Dancy varieties comprising the remainder.
Sunburst bearing trees are down five percent but the average fruit per tree has increased over 50 percent and the crop could set a production record.
Fruit size measurements taken during objective surveys have been average and it is projected that it will take only two more fruit than last season to fill a 4/5 bushel carton.
Although droppage is ahead of last season's near record low level, it is still below the average of the previous 10 seasons.
Fallglo bearing trees declined over three percent this season but fruit per tree increased nearly 20 percent resulting in a fruit population 15 percent higher.
Fruit size is below the series average and expected to attain a measurement similar to last season.
While current droppage is slightly ahead of last season, it is below average.
Honey tangerines, forecast at 2.2 million boxes, are up seven percent from last season's production and surpassed only by the record 2.8 million boxes of 1979-80 and 2.65 million boxes harvested in 1999-00.
Bearing trees increased by less than one percent but average fruit per tree is down over 13 percent from 2000-01.
Fruit size is close to the maximum of the previous 10 year series and it is projected that it will take about a dozen fewer fruit to fill a 4/5 bushel carton.
Droppage is below the series average and the portion remaining for harvest is expected to be slightly better than last season.
LIMES 320,000 BUSHELS
The 2001-02 lime crop, first forecast in April 2001, is continued at 320,000 bushels (200,000 boxes).
This is less than the 400,000 bushels (250,000 boxes) utilized last season.
Only about one-third of the lime trees in Dade County remain since those exposed to Xanthomonas (citrus canker) have been destroyed.
Continuing surveys for the disease may result in loss of more trees and may affect the total crop utilization.
5 __________________________________________________________________
FORECAST PROCEDURES FOR THE 2001-02 SEASON
All citrus forecasts except seedy grapefruit, Robinson and Dancy tangerines, limes, and K-Early Citrus Fruit are based on actual fruit counts and measurements.
These objective count methods utilize: (1) the bearing age tree population provided from the latest aerial photography with field verifications, (2) the average fruit per tree obtained from the fruit count survey using randomly selected trees and limbs, and (3) the fruit measurement and fruit drop count surveys to determine fruit sizes and loss from fruit droppage.
The latest Commercial Citrus Inventory is the base used to determine forecast tree numbers for this season.
All trees planted in 1998 and earlier are included.
An attrition factor by age and area was applied to these base numbers to account for tree losses since the inventory period.
The same unbiased fruit count procedures were used as in all of the past 44 seasons.
These include drawing the sample with known probabilities from the Commercial Citrus Inventory based on analyses of the variability in fruit per tree.
Using random path procedures, count limbs on sample trees are preselected to improve accuracy.
Fruit on these limbs are counted in the mid-July to mid-September period.
Fruit size surveys were conducted in August and September.
The fruit loss surveys (drop count) were begun in August.
These surveys, along with historical records, were used to project the fruit size at harvest and the fruit population that is expected to remain on trees at harvest.
The chart below describes the relationship of the September 2001 early and midseason orange (excluding Navels) fruit size measurements with those taken in September 2000.
The diameter measurements shown are the minimum values of each eighth inch range, except for the smallest values.

Size frequency distributions developed from the September size survey are shown in the following table.
The distributions are by percent of fruit falling within the size range of each 4/5-bushel container.
These frequency distributions relate to fruit from regular bloom and exclude summer bloom in all years.
