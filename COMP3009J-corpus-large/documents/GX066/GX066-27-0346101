This forecast is 13.6 percent larger than the 185.7 million boxes recorded last season but 13.5 percent less than the record high utilization of 244.0 million boxes in 1997-98.
The two forecast divisions are: early-midseason oranges at 124.0 million boxes (including 5.4 million boxes of Navels) and late type (Valencia) at 87.0 million boxes.
All forecasts are based entirely on tree counts, fruit counts, and measurements made by the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service and project the amounts of fruit utilized in certified fresh and processing form, including about one percent for non-recorded fruit.
Historically, all oranges have been utilized.
The October all orange forecasts during the past 10 non-freeze seasons have differed from the final recorded utilization by an average of 3.1 percent, ranging from 8.8 percent in 1990-91 to 0.3 percent in 1992-93.
Last season's difference was 2.3 percent above the recorded utilization.
Four of the 10 October forecasts have indicated more than was finally recorded and six have indicated less.

, especially in portions of the East Coast and Lower Interior, with lesser amounts elsewhere.
The later regular bloom fruit is not as prevalent in oranges as some other varieties and varies by grove from non-existent to the predominant amount.
Most areas received abundant beneficial summer rains from several storms without detrimental wind effect.
A re-survey was conducted in late September in the East Coast area of a number of Limb Count sample groves, indicating only minor fruit losses in some samples.
The data collection and sampling procedures used in all forecasts are identical with past seasons.
These are described on page six of this report.
Bearing trees include 1996 plantings (three years at bloom time) as recorded in the 1998 Commercial Citrus Inventory, updated by two seasons of attrition.
For expansion in this forecast, 78.4 million trees are used, down 1.6 percent from last season.
This summer's objective fruit count survey (Limb Count) indicated the average fruit per tree for all oranges to be 11.9 percent more than last season.
As tree plantings decrease, the youngest age group of 3 - 5 year old trees is now contributing less than two percent to the total fruit population (trees X fruit per tree).
The major factor in the fruit population is the 1986 through 1990 plant dates, with 36 percent.
The oldest age group (pre 1976) only contributed 26 percent.
All fruit having a diameter of 11/16 inch at count time is included in the forecast.
Less than four percent "non-regular" (mid-April and later) is included in the forecast, as compared with one percent or less most seasons.
Although more than normal, this fruit is expected to be harvested.
An average of one fruit per tree (June and later bloom) is not in the forecast.

FCOJ YIELD 1.60 GALLONS PER BOX The all orange FCOJ yield projection is 1.60 gallons per box of 42 degrees Brix concentrate.
This is only slightly less than last season's record 1.63 gallons per box as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association.
The 1996-97 yield was 1.57 gallons and the 1997-98 season yield was 1.58 gallons per box.
A projection of the early and late (Valencia) categories will be made in the January release.
All projections of yield assume processing relationships of the past several seasons.
Results of orange and grapefruit maturity testing with comparisons are found on pages three and four of this report.
_________________________________________________________________
EARLY AND MIDSEASON 124.0 MILLION BOXES
The early-midseason orange forecast (including Navels) is 124.0 million boxes.
The forecast is 10.7 percent more than the 112.0 million boxes recorded last season but 11.4 percent smaller than the record large crop of 140.0 million boxes in 1997-98.
Excluding Navels, 36.1 million trees are used in this forecast.
The sample average fruit count per tree, weighted by a 25 cell age/area matrix, is almost 12 percent more than last season and larger than five of the past nine seasons.
Less than three percent "non-regular" bloom fruit is included in the forecast.
The early portion (mostly Hamlin) contributes 82 percent to the early-mid fruit population.
Thirty-seven percent of the total early-mid population is in the 1986-90 plant dates.
However, the largest average fruit per tree continues in the 15 year old and older age groups.
Average fruit size in September (measured in cubic inches) is about seven percent more than last season.
The growth rate between August and September has been slightly above the average.
It is projected that it will take close to six fewer fruit than last season to make a 90 pound equivalent box at harvest.
Fruit loss from droppage until harvest is projected to be 10 percent which would be at the mean of the past nine seasons.
Droppage from the tree is the only factor used for loss and is relative for use in analysis.
Loss factors can vary with subsequent weather conditions and harvest patters.
NAVEL ORANGES 5.4 MILLION BOXES
The Navel orange forecast of 5.4 million boxes is eight percent more than certified last season (including less than 0.8 million boxes of gift fruit shipments and other non-certified use).
The record large crop was 6.4 million boxes in 1996-97 followed by 6.3 million boxes in 1997-98.
Tree numbers are down 51,000 from last season.
Attrition in this variety is outweighing new plantings.
Average fruit per tree is up over 19 percent from last season, however it is still about 20 fruit below the past nine season average.
The projected fruit per box at harvest indicates that it will take about two fruit less to fill a 4/5 bushel equivalent carton.
Loss from droppage, mostly from fruit splitting is projected at a 15 percent level, which is about average.
Less than two percent "non-regular" bloom fruit is in the forecast.
Because of significant differences in fruit set, size, drop, and harvest patterns of this variety from other oranges, a separate expansion is used as an add-on indicator in the early-mid and all orange forecasts.
VALENCIAS 87.0 MILLION BOXES
The 87.0 million boxes late type (Valencia) forecast is 18 percent more than last season's 73.7 million boxes.
It is 16 percent below the record large crop of 104.0 million boxes recorded in 1997-98 and five percent less than the 92.0 million boxes in 1996-97.
Trees used in the forecast total 39.3 million as compared with 39.5 million last season.
The average fruit per tree is up over 11 percent from the low fruit set last season.
Statewide, less than five percent of the fruit is of a "non-regular" bloom characteristic.
Although this is more than the seasonal average, it is only a minor consideration in the total forecast.
The majority of this later bloom fruit is in the East Coast and Lower Interior areas.
The September fruit size (in cubic inches) of all the "regular" fruit is larger than last season and projected to harvest, will require eight fewer fruit to make a 90 pound equivalent box.
Loss from fruit droppage to harvest is projected below the above average 20 percent level of last season.
With the amount of time from this forecast to Valencia harvest, the loss factor is the most difficult to project accurately.
TEMPLES 2.1 MILLION BOXES
The Temple forecast of 2.1 million boxes is almost 17 percent more than the 1.8 million boxes recorded last season.
Bearing trees continue a downward trend, estimated to be almost six percent less than last season.
The average fruit per tree increased 31 percent, making a fruit population increase of almost 24 percent.
An estimated 10 percent "non-regular" bloom fruit is included in the forecast as compared with less than three percent last season.
Average fruit per box at harvest is projected to be the same as last season, which reflects a relatively small average fruit size.
Fruit loss from droppage is projected to be more than last season but well below the nine season average.
TANGELOS 2.6 MILLION BOXES
The 2.6 million boxes tangelo forecast is only 0.05 million boxes more than recorded last season.
Tangelo bearing trees are down almost three percent from last year and a portion of the 1.4 million trees are used as pollinators for other hybrids.
The average fruit per tree is also less than last season.
However, the September fruit size is over 15 percent larger, projecting that it will take about 15 fewer fruit to fill a 4/5 bushel carton at harvest.
Fruit loss from droppage is projected to be less than seven of the past nine seasons.
K-EARLY CITRUS 70,000 BOXES
The K-Early Citrus Fruit forecast at 70,000 boxes is 10,000 boxes less than recorded last season but above the record low use in 1997-98.
K-Early trees continue to be removed.
The other factors for this crop are constructed from tangelo data, which has similar characteristics.

MATURITY
These are the second maturity tests of the 1999-00 season for all but the late oranges which are tested for the first time.
All of the samples tested are from the route surveys, which cover all five major citrus producing areas.
The sample size has remained constant for the past several seasons.
The grapefruit sample size began with 100 which included 50 samples each for the white and colored types.
One white grapefruit sample and two of the colored samples were picked by the time of this survey.
These samples were picked September 27 and 28 and tested September 29 - October 1 in the Orlando test lab of the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
Regular bloom fruit, which included fruit from the bloom period of January through May, was picked for testing.
Rains and thunderstorms during September were generally above normal with some standing water in low land groves.
Hurricane Floyd and Tropical Storm Harvey brought additional moisture to Florida's citrus belt during the month.
This month's wet conditions caused some of the early types of fruit to make rapid growth.
Maturity levels are lagging behind last year for all fruit types tested except colored grapefruit which are only slightly ahead.
The higher acid levels of all oranges combined with the lower Brix have produced lower ratios and have contributed to a slower start for the fresh fruit packing houses.
The current pounds solids for all oranges is the lowest for October 1 in recent history.

SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT 49.5 MILLION BOXES
The all seedless grapefruit forecast is 49.5 million boxes, six percent more than last season's utilization of 46.5 million boxes.
No economic abandonment is expected this season because of low juice inventories and increased demand.
The varietal division is 20.5 million boxes of white seedless and 29.0 million boxes of colored varieties.
Last season only 17.8 million boxes of white seedless was utilized and 28.7 of colored.

White bearing trees are down from last season over four percent to 4.2 million and colored are down three percent to 7.6 million.
Tree numbers are estimated using the special grapefruit tree inventory conducted last spring.
White average fruit per tree is up 26 percent causing the fruit population (trees X fruit per tree) to increase 21 percent from last season.
Colored fruit per tree is up seven percent with the fruit population up four percent.
The evaluation of "non-regular" bloom (later than mid-April) made on the objective fruit count survey limbs indicates that over 12 percent of all fruit counted were in this category.
This compares with less than two percent last season, which is about average.
However, this later bloom is not uniformly distributed by area or age.
Some trees have more than 75 percent and some have none.
This will undoubtedly cause harvest problems in many groves.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT 0.5 MILLION BOXES
The seedy (Duncan) grapefruit forecast is 500,000 boxes.
Recorded utilization last season was 550,000 boxes with 650,000 boxes recorded in 1997-98.
Bearing trees are now less than 200,000.
The fruit per tree is up from the very low average last season by 27 percent.
However, almost 12 percent of the fruit counted was of a "non-regular" size and shape.
All of this variety goes into processed product and the recording is dependent on load tickets at the plants.
ALL TANGERINES 6.4 MILLION BOXES
The forecast for all varieties of tangerines is 6.4 million boxes, 29 percent more than the 4.950 million boxes utilized last season.
However, it is only 0.1 million boxes larger than the 1996-97 season crop.
Two divisions comprise the total forecast: Early at 4.2 million boxes and Honey at 2.2 million boxes.
The Early category is allocated, in million boxes: Robinson, 0.200; Fallglo, 0.800; Sunburst, 3.100; and Dancy at 0.100.
Sunburst is the predominate variety in the Early division, comprising 74 percent of the total.
The attrition rate caused a slight decrease in the tree numbers but the average fruit per tree increased dramatically, over 64 percent from last season, which was the lowest in the past six seasons.
Also, the September average fruit size is larger than last season but fruit loss from droppage at harvest is projected to be two percent more.
Fruit population of Fallglo, the most recent commercial variety, is 72 percent more than last season.
The fruit size is projected to be larger at harvest than last season.
No "non-regular" bloom was recorded and loss from droppage is expected to be less.
Harvest is already underway and should be complete by December.
Robinson trees continue to decline, however, the average fruit per tree is up 69 percent from last season.
Although the average fruit size in September is larger than last season, fruit loss from droppage is greater.
This variety is now less than five percent of the Early total.
Dancy, once the major commercial tangerine, now contributes less than three percent to the Early total.
Trees continue to be removed.
Although the average fruit per tree is up 60 percent from last season's small fruit set, the "non-regular" bloom category accounts for 46 percent of the total.
Based on current fruit size, it would take 238 fruit to fill a 4/5 bushel carton equivalent at harvest.
Honey tangerines, the later maturing variety, at 2.2 million boxes is up almost 16 percent from last season and could be the largest crop since the 1979-80 season.
Bearing trees are up slightly and the average fruit per tree is almost 11 percent more than last season, causing an increase of over 14 percent in fruit population.
Only five percent is considered "non-regular" bloom.
Fruit size is projected to be smaller than in 1998-99.
Fruit loss from droppage, a major factor in final utilization, has ranged from 21 to 62 percent in the past 17 non-freeze seasons, and is projected below average this season.
LIMES 960,000 BUSHELS
The 1999-00 lime crop, first forecast in April 1999, is continued at 960,000 bushels (600,000 boxes).
This is 20 percent more than last season's total production of 800,000 bushels (500,000) boxes).
Production has increased yearly since the low of 200,000 boxes in the 1993-94 season following the August 1992 hurricane.
5 _________________________________________________________________
FORECAST PROCEDURES FOR THE 1999-00 SEASON
All citrus forecasts except limes and K-Early Citrus Fruit are based on actual fruit counts and measurements.
These objective count methods utilize: (1) the bearing age tree population provided from the latest aerial photography with field verifications; (2) the average fruit per tree obtained from the fruit count survey using randomly selected trees and limbs; and (3) the fruit measurement and fruit drop count surveys to determine fruit sizes and loss from fruit droppage.
The latest Commercial Citrus Inventory is the base used to determine forecast tree numbers for the 1999-00 season.
All trees planted in 1996 and earlier are included.
An attrition factor by age and area was applied to these base numbers to account for tree losses since the inventory period.
The same unbiased fruit count procedures were used as in all of the past 42 seasons.
These include drawing the sample with known probabilities from the Commercial Citrus Inventory based on analyses of the variability in fruit per tree.
Using random path procedures, count limbs on sample trees are preselected to improve accuracy.
Fruit on these limbs are counted in the mid July to mid September period.
Fruit size surveys were conducted in August and September.
The fruit loss surveys (drop count) were begun in August.
These surveys, along with historical records, were used to project the fruit size at harvest and the fruit population that is expected to remain on trees at harvest.
The chart below describes the relationship of the September 1999 early and midseason orange (excluding Navels) fruit size measurements with those taken in September 1998.
The diameter measurements shown are the minimum values of each eighth inch range, except for the smallest values.

Size frequency distributions developed from the September size survey are shown in the following table.
The distributions are by percent of fruit falling within the size range of each 4/5-bushel container.
These frequency distributions relate to fruit from regular bloom and exclude summer bloom in all years.
