In this introduction to the study of popular culture in education, Nadine Dolby offers an insightful review of the literature informing this work.
Her essay begins to address why educators and educational researchers should pay particular attention to popular culture.
Discussing the relevant literature and introducing readers to historical debates in the field, Dolby distinguishes between various understandings of popular culture and approaches to studying its relationship to education.
Ultimately, Dolby argues, the importance of popular culture and its connection to education lies in the role it plays as a site for engaging in the process of democratic practice.
She encourages educators to engage young people in a deep exploration of ihe multiple dimensions of popular culture and the public sphere, and highlights examples of this kind of engagement.

AR3109 -- Ognibene, Elaine R. THE MISSIONARY POSITION: BARBARA KINGSOLVER'S THE POISONWOOD BIBLE (College Literature, Summer 2003, pp. 19-28) -- Visit the IRC for full text
This essay reveals how Barbara Kingsolver illustrates the hypocrisy of religious rhetoric and practice that sacrifices the many for the good of the few in power, drawing a clear parallel between a missionary's attitude and colonial imperialism.
In The Poisonwood Bible, Nathan Price does not represent the missionary profession: he "is a symbolic figure . . . suggesting many things about the way U.S. and Europe have approached Africa with a history of cultural arrogance and misunderstanding at every turn."
Nonetheless, Kingsolver shows how, contrary to popular opinion, religion and politics compose a combined force used historically not only to "convert the savages" but to convert the masses to believe that what is done in the name of democratic, Christian principles is done for the greater good.
The essay examines the effects of Nathan's missionary position on his wife, his four daughters, and the Congolese.
Although Kingsolver uses different narrative voices to construct her political allegory, each voice exposes the missionary tactics of the man called "Our Father" as monolithic, abusive, domineering and destructive.
This essay offers one "particular" angled version of a multidimensional novel: it illustrates how in "(un)doing the missionary position," Kingsolver connects consequences with actions and challenges readers to do likewise.

THE OURANG-OUTANG SITUATION (College Literature, Summer 2003, pp. 88-98) -- Visit the IRC for full text
The crime at the heart of Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" is the slave insurrection, but the real mystery of this story concerns why this reading is not more obvious.
A discussion of the classroom challenges of this interpretation reveals some shortcomings of "structuralist" pedagogies while highlighting the advantages of Sartre's "situational" approach to historical context.

Chaney attempts to investigate the possible answers to the question on where does technology lead to in Ishmael Reed's novel "Flight to Canada."
He further explores Reed's fascination with African-American culture as a viral form of information that eventually causes an imperialist crisis of communication control (cybernetics) and his analogy between two kinds of hybrids in the novel, the man-machine cyborg and the animal-man hybridizing of slaves.
AR3113 -- Murphy, Bruce F. THE COURAGE OF ROBINSON JEFFERS (Poetry, August 2003, pp. 279-784) -- Visit the IRC for full text
Murphy comments on the works of poet Robinson Jeffers.
Jeffers was a poet who believed wholeheartedly that the sole business of poetry was to express the astonishing beauty of things however was more or less expelled from the canon of American literature for his political views.
Jeffers isolationist politics and criticisms of Roosevelt, as shown in his 1938 "The Selected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers" edited by Tim Hunt, were unacceptable to an America that had won the war against Germany and Japan thus caused the loss of his reputation.

Gambino features Walt Whitman, a liberator of people and culture using a liberated poetic form.
Whitman's faith in democracy was rooted in a belief in the best of the human souls of ordinary citizens, often dismissed as his "mysticism."
But his response on the question of the existence of the soul did not depend on abstractions but on the perceived experience of personal and historical growth.

AR3116 -- Fisher, Benjamin F. SIMMS'S BOSKY GOTHIC, THE "REGION OF DOUBT AND SHADOW" (Studies in the Novel, Summer 2003, pp. 157-68) -- Visit the IRC for full text
Fisher examines Gothicism in William Gilmore Simms' fictions, from "Martin Faber," published in 1832, to "Woodcraft," published in 1852.
He further notes that Simms' use of lore that imparts qualities of Gothic villainy with biblical legendry also constitutes a creativity often found among American writers' presentations; Simms' Gothicism, then, is neither an excrescence nor an isolated phenomenon in the American literary canon.

AR3100 -- Komins, Benton Jay; Nicholls, David G. CULTIVATING CRITICAL SELF-REFLECTION IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT: THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AMERICAN STUDIES CURRICULUM IN TURKEY (College Literature, Summer 2003, pp. 68-77) -- Visit the IRC for full text
Many literature professors in the U.S. strive to foster skills of critical self-reflection: we ask students to be responsible to textual evidence, historical context, and the implications of the interpreter's acts.
Recent teaching also stresses the transnational contexts for literary expression and interpretation.
But what happens when these pedagogical practices are transported to classrooms abroad? This essay addresses this broad question through the problem of developing an American Studies curriculum in Turkey.
The authors outline the conceptual genealogy of departments of "American Culture and Literature" in Turkey and then relate it to narratives of emergence for American Studies in the U.S. and other countries.
The authors then discuss the evolution of the curriculum they revised.
They conclude by assessing the outcome, especially noting the difficulty of cultivating critical self-reflection in a social and institutional setting that has few of the safeguards for freedom of expression found in the U.S.
AR3101 -- Bauer, Margaret D. FORGET THE LEGEND AND READ THE WORK: TEACHING TWO STORIES BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY (College Literature, Summer 2003, pp. 124-130) -- Visit the IRC for full text
This essay discusses the writer's strategies and experiences teaching two stories by Ernest Hemingway: "Indian Camp" and "Hills Like White Elephants."
Bauer uses these stories as an opportunity to show students that they should not make assumptions about a writer's work based on some vague impression they have of the author's character.
An image of Hemingway as some macho hunter, drinker, womanizer, and misogynist, for example, could blind the reader to any positive reading of his female characters.
Bauer's reading of "Indian Camp" takes on criticism that condemns Hemingway for his focus on male characters and use of women as mere props in the story; Bauer defends the author's right to tell whoever's story he chooses and points out that Hemingway may be focusing on the men in this story, but he is not valorizing them or approving of their treatment of the Indian woman in labor.
And Bauer employs "Hills Like White Elephants" to show that, not only is this more the woman's story, but also that she is much more positively characterized than her lover.
AR3102 -- Entzminger, Betina.
PLAYING IN THE DARK WITH WELTY: THE SYMBOLIC ROLE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN DELTA WEDDING (College Literature, Summer 2003, pp. 52-60) -- Visit the IRC for full text
Using theories of Toni Morrison and Ralph Ellison, this essay explores the symbolic role that African American characters play for white characters in Eudora Welty's early novel, Delta Wedding.
Entzminger's main intent is not to explicate Welty's political message about southern racism but to uncover the black character's positions in the white characters' perceptions of their own identities.
According to Ellison, "for the Southern artist, the Negro becomes a symbol of his personal rebellion, his guilt and his repression of it" (Ellison 1953, 42).
By revisiting in Delta Wedding Welty's often explored theme of the individual versus the community, the reader will see that moments of conflict between what the individual wants and what the community expects are often accompanied by enigmatic black character, a character that embodies the white protagonist's, and perhaps indirectly the author's, personal feelings of rebellion.
AR3103 -- Hampton, Gregory Jerome, Brooks, Wanda M. OCTAVIA BUTLER AND VIRGINIA HAMILTON: BLACK WOMEN WRITERS AND SCIENCE FICTION (English Journal, July 2003, pp. 70-74) -- Visit the IRC for full text
African American literature has sought to express the humanity of black people through narratives of struggle, adaptation, and survival.
Hampton and Brooks examine the writings of African American science fiction writers particularly Octavia Butler and Virginia Hamilton.
These two authors are unique among the small but growing number of African American writers of science fiction because their books examine the connections between the stories of a culture and the genre of science fiction.

QUALITY OF LIFE? THE EMERGENT CRITIQUE OF AMERICA'S WORK-CENTERED CULTURE (Vital Speeches of the Day, July 1, 2003, pp. 555-559) -- Visit the IRC for full text
The new time-aware literature on quality of American life comprises a mere handful of texts, but they are having a profound impact on our self-understanding.
A distinguishing feature of this new literature is that it approaches the ingredients of quality of life empirically, sifting through statistical evidence to establish what is happening to our collective lives.
Additionally, most of these works try to make sense of hard findings by proposing theoretical explanations for observable trends.
This combination signifies a departure from the subjective style of anti-modernist polemics that American intellectuals have produced since at least as long ago as Thoreau's Walden.
In the cases of Hochschild, Schor and Putnam, this theorizing has unmistakably influenced the way we think about and now talk about American society, having given currency to the terms "second shift", "time poverty" and "social capital" respectively.
Finally, although the methods of this new literature are essentially empirical, their overall contribution has been to make quality of life - from the point of view of the individual, including both subjective and objective factors such as personal satisfaction and health - a litmus of the condition of social institutions and the basis for a powerful critique.

In March 2000 over three hundred scholars interested in the study of American Multiethnic literatures gathered in New Orleans for a MELUS conference entitled "Multi-Ethnic Literature and the Idea of Social Justice."
The driving force of the conference was the recognition that while issues of social justice are among the most important concerns of minority writers, the works of these writers have largely been ignored by the "law and literature" movement in the legal academy.
The call of the conference was explicit: to engage in the active de-canonization of the field of law and literature, and to show through example how the inclusion of literature emerging from a wide variety of ethnic experiences in America Would challenge the settled assumptions of the field.

WHICH AMERICA IS OURS? MARTI'S "TRUTH" AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF "AMERICAN LITERATURE" (Modern Fiction Studies, Spring 2003, pp. 19-55) -- Visit the IRC for full text
The author refutes the opinion of many critics of affirmative action and curricular reform, who say minorities have made overwhelming gains in higher education and completely taken over English departments.
The reconfigured canon, as demonstrated by the new "American literature" anthologies, surely demonstrates for these critics that inequality and discrimination are things of the past and that we should get back to just reading texts as texts rather than continuing to politicize education.
He believes such criticisms rely on a false and inaccurate assessment of the current state of US universities.

DIS(RE)MEMBERED BODIES: CORMAC MCCARTHY'S BORDER FICTION (Modern Fiction Studies, Spring 2003, pp. 155-181) -- Visit the IRC for full text
Cormac McCarthy's fifth novel, Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West (1985), marked a shift from the Southern settings of his earlier novels to the Southwest settings of his subsequent novels.
In contrast to the mostly Appalachian settings of The Orchard Keeper (1965), Outer Dark (1968), Child of God (1973), and Suttree (1979), Blood Meridian begins in the Tennessee hills but almost immediately has its protagonist, "the kid," light out for the territory, specifically Texas, in 1848.
This change of settings from Tennessee to Texas has raised the question of whether McCarthy should still be classified as a Southern writer in the regionalist tradition of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, or whether he has instead become a Western writer a la Louis L'Amour and Tony Hillerman (Phillips 434-35).

In a variety of discursive and material forms, artists, activists and cultural critics are in the process of documenting a shift in late-twentieth-century notions of what constitutes a nation, a people, and even subjectivity itself.
This shift has important implications for the categories and frameworks through which literary scholars are approaching the study of modern fiction.
In contrast to former paradigms by which national identity and sovereignty have been understood in the United States, emerging forms of study variously organized around notions of the "new" or "post-nationalist" offer strikingly different conceptions.
Eschewing notions such as consensus, uniqueness, or even subversion in the construction of the national subject that have often guided American literary historiography, the essays collected in this special issue of MFS participate in the production of this alternative by articulating the idea of the transnational imaginary as a guiding concept.

POSTMODERN BEARS IN THE TEXTS OF GERALD VIZENOR (MELUS, Fall 2002, pp. 93-112) -- Visit the IRC for full text
Most of the commentary on Gerald Vizenor's fiction focuses upon trickster and the post-modern implications of Vizenor's texts; however, bears and their meaning within the Chippewa oral tradition and religion appear often and directly in Vizenor's work.
Discussing the famous Lakota leader Luther Standing Bear's comments on bears, Vizenor notes that "the bear is an archshadow in the silence of tribal stories, the memories and sense that are unsaid in the name."
If, as Vizenor often asserts, trickster is a figure in a language game, then bear is a shadow in remembered tribal stories and rituals of the Grand Medicine Society or midewiwin, and this shadow looms heavily over Vizenor's texts.
Barry discusses the work of Gerald Vizenor.

He states that Poe's point in charging Hawthorne with unoriginality at the outset of his critique is to prepare Poe to give salutary advice at the end about how Hawthorne can "mend his pen."

KATE CHOPIN AND ANNA JULIA COOPER: CRITIQUING KENTUCKY AND THE SOUTH (Southern Literary Journal, Fall 2002, pp. 123-137) -- Visit the IRC for full text
Kate Chopin has been difficult for scholars to fix as a southern writer, beyond an earlier view of her as an exceptional local colorist whose work-especially her second novel The Awakening-looked forward to the modernist literature produced by many southern writers in the twentieth century.
Having stopped writing as the twentieth century was dawning, she could not qualify as a Southern Renascence writer, at least according to the paradigm directing Southern literary studies that held sway into the 1980s.

In recent years critics have begun to mention the influence of Toni Morrison on their reading of Kate Chopin's The Awakening.
Elizabeth Ammons refers to Morrison's essay "Unspeakable Things Unspoken" as she moves from her initial thesis that Edna's freedom was purchased at the price of black women to the position that the novel, "so deliberately repressive of race on its surface" (76), is structured in a way that contradicts this seeming racism.
Michele A. Birnbaum opens her essay " `Alien Hands': Kate Chopin and the Colonization of Race" with an epigraph from Morrison, as does Heather Kirk Thomas in "`The House of Sylvie' in Kate Chopin's 'Athnaise."'
Catherine Lundie uses Ammons' work with Morrison to inform her own study, "Doubly Dispossessed: Kate Chopin's Women of Color."

Nineteenth-century histories of American literature in particular were instrumental in constructing an anti-British national narrative by concentrating their historiographical definitions of America's cultural identity on a rhetorical separation of America's literary culture from that of Great Britain.
In the course of the twentieth century, however, this myopically Anglo-centric perspective is gradually replaced by far more diversified negotiations of America's interliterary and intercultural relations.

Although it seems incredible today that nineteenth-century "Manifest Destiny" could be distinguished from other European imperial projects in the Western Hemisphere--virtually all of which were being contested in various ways by native people and colonial emigres--the US transnational imaginary was rationalized by such philosophical rhetorics as American transcendentalism.
However critical Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Walt Whitman, and other transcendentalists may have been of specific US imperial projects, like the Mexican-American War and slavery, transcendentalism relied on a rhetoric of transcendental expansion, internalization (and thus appropriation), and psychic progress and development well suited to the politics of Jacksonian America.

HOCCLEVE, THE VIRGIN, AND THE POLITICS OF COMPLAINT (PMLA.
Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, October 2002, pp. 1172-1187.)
-- Visit the IRC for full text
What is the relation between Marian lament and the distinctively modern, autobiographical complaints of Thomas Hoccleve? What, moreover, is the relation between Hoccleve's performances of private misery and his ability to offer advice and counsel to princes? This article argues that Hoccleve's "Complaint of the Virgin" can teach us to recognize the complex interweaving of gender, genre, ideality, and excess that informs Hocclevean complaints more generally.
"The Complaint of the Virgin" explores a woman's exemplary transition from subversive investment in private connection and private suffering to self-abnegation and participation in public power.
In doing so, the poem provides a model for Hoccleve's own movements between marginalized inferiority and public rhetoric--and for his meditation between Lancastrian subjects and their sovereign.
The Virgin offers a lesson in the pleasures and power of complaint, the disciplining of interiority, and the production of social relations through spectacle and sacrifice..

Yet to read the ending simply as a harmonious "balancing of the book"--with Jane and St. John heeding separate, but equal, divine callings--is to overlook the difficulties Victorian women of faith faced in trying to reconcile their spiritual integrity with cultural norms of domesticity and femininity..

WRITING LIVES, WRITING LIES: THE PURSUIT OF APOCRYPHAL BIOGRAPHIES (Mosaic, September 2002, pp. 73-88) -- Visit the IRC for full text
Steven Millhauser's "Edwin Mullhouse: The Life and Death of an American Writer, 1943-1954 by Jeffrey Cartwright" and Augusto Monterroso's "Lo demas es silencio: La vida y la obra de Eduardo Torres" underscore in a Borgesian fashion the fictionality and incompleteness of biographical discourse.
In their works, parodic and apocryphal writings revise the relationship between the biographer and the biographee and pose the question of whether it is really possible to write about someone's life..

POSTMODERN JEWISH IDENTITY IN PHILIP ROTH'S THE COUNTERLIFE (Modern Fiction Studies, West Lafayette; Summer 2002; Vol. 48, Iss. 2; pg. 422.)
--Visit the IRC for full text
Royal argues that the significance of Philip Roth's novel "The Counterlife" lies not solely in its thematic investigations into Jewish ethnicity or its postmodern and metafictional structure, but in the combination of the two: its use of narrative labyrinths in articulating the construction of a postmodern Jewish-American identity..
