Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration Implementation Final Environmental Impact Statement November 1996 Contents _______________________________________________________________________ Purpose and Need: The Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries are severely degraded as a result of two hydroelectric dams (projects) and their reservoirs built in the early 1900s.
Congress has mandated the full restoration of this ecosystem and its native anadromous fisheries through the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (Public Law 102-495).
The Department of the Interior has found there is a need to return this river and the ecosystem to its natural, self-regulating state, and proposes to implement the Congressional mandate by removing both dams in a safe, environmentally sound and cost effective manner and implementing fisheries and ecosystem restoration planning.
Only dam removal would fully restore the ecosystem or its native anadromous fisheries.
Proposed Action: The U.S. Department of the Interior proposes to fully restore the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries through the removal of Elwha Dam and Glines Canyon Dam and implementing fish restoration and revegetation.
Dam removal would occur over a 2-year period.
Elwha Dam would be removed by blasting, and Glines Canyon Dam by a combination of blasting and diamond wire saw cutting.
Lake Aldwell would be drained by a diversion channel, and Lake Mills by notching down Glines Canyon Dam.
Stored sediment would be eroded naturally by the Elwha River.
The proposed action is located in Clallam County, on the Olympic Peninsula, in Washington State.
Lead/Cooperating agencies: The National Park Service is the lead agency.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe are cooperating agencies/governments on this EIS.
Type of statement: This is a final environmental impact statement (EIS).
Because public and agency comments did not substantially modify any of the alternatives or the environmental analysis in the draft EIS, the full text of the draft has not been reprinted.
Rather, the attached material includes a summary of responses to comments, factual corrections and text changes in the form of errata sheets, and copies of letters received from agencies and organizations.
Substantive comments from all written and oral comments on the draft EIS were summarized and responded to in the attached Responses to Comment section.
The complete final EIS includes the draft EIS and the material attached to this abstract.
This final EIS is tiered, or procedurally connected, to Interior's June 1995 final Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration EIS, which determined dam removal was required to fully restore the Elwha River ecosystem and anadromous fisheries.
Abstract: In addition to the proposed action, two other alternatives are examined.
They are: removing fine-grained sediment prior to dam removal by using suction dredges, and sending the slurry to the Strait of Juan de Fuca in a pipeline, and No Action (i.e., dams are retained as is, without fish passage measures).
The Proposed Action is also the Department of the Interior's "preferred alternative."
Short-term adverse impacts from removing both dams would result from the release of sediment now trapped in the reservoirs.
The finer grained particles would temporarily but significantly impact fish or other aquatic organisms.
Impacts on water quality, river morphology, flooding, native anadromous and resident (i.e., trout and char) fisheries, living marine resources, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, vegetation, cultural resources, land use, recreation, aesthetic resources, and socioeconomics are also examined in this environmental impact statement.
Both of the other alternatives would also have significant impacts on resources examined in this document.
Public Involvement: Oral comments were taken on the draft EIS in Washington State in three public workshops on May 21-22, 1996.
Written comments were taken for a 60-day period which ended June 27, 1996.
Substantive comments were responded to in a question/answer format, and by making appropriate text changes to the draft.
Those text changes are attached as errata sheets, and should be used in conjunction with Interior's April 1996 draft Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration Implementation EIS.
To obtain a draft or the location of the nearest agency or library which has a copy of the draft, contact Olympic National Park at (360) 452-4501 x264.
Copies will be sent to those who request them until the current supply is exhausted.
All who received a draft EIS in the initial April 1996 mailing will also receive the attached material.
Guide to Using This Document
The attached document includes the following: * A series of "errata sheets" or changes to the text of Interior's draft Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration Implementation environmental impact statement (Implementation EIS)
* Responses to Comments received on the Implementation EIS, indexed by subject and by author
* A new and revised Consultation and Coordination chapter
* A new appendix (appendix 7), the US Fish and Wildlife Service's Biological Opinion, and
* Copies of substantive comment letters received on the draft Implementation EIS from all agencies and organizations
The combination of these materials and Interior's draft Implementation EIS serves as an "abbreviated" final EIS.
The reasoning behind an abbreviated EIS, and the contents of errata sheets and the Responses to Comments section is explained in further detail below.
The regulations which determine how the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) will be carried out include an option for responding to public comments on a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) when few changes result from those comments.
The relevant section of these regulations (CFR 1503.4) states that if changes in response to public comments are minor and confined to factual corrections or explanations of why comments do not warrant further agency response, they may be written on errata sheets and attached to the draft EIS, instead of rewriting, printing and mailing the entire revised draft.
The National Park Service (NPS) has opted to follow this "abbreviated" EIS procedure for the Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration Implementation EIS (Implementation EIS).
NPS received 374 letters on the draft Implementation EIS.
The number of separate comments in these letters and those taken at three workshops May 21-22, 1996 totaled nearly 500.
Many of these comments were very similar or identical to those received on Interior's programmatic EIS on how best to restore the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries.
This document, Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration EIS, was finalized in June 1995 (copies are available from Olympic National Park).
Although NPS received a large number of comments, few resulted in even minor factual corrections to the draft Implementation EIS.
When they did, or when the EIS team elaborated and explained material which may have been unclear in the draft, text changes in the form of errata sheets were made.
These sheets must be used in conjunction with the draft EIS.
Copies of the Implementation EIS are available by calling Olympic National Park at (360) 452-4501 x264 or by going to regional libraries that are listed in the Consultation and Coordination section of this document.
In addition to the text changes, specialists from the EIS team responded directly to each substantive comment received.
The NEPA regulations described above also allow agencies to summarize public comments and respond to those summaries when appropriate.
In an effort to reduce paperwork, streamline the planning process and reduce printing costs, all substantive comments have been summarized and combined where there is overlap in this final Implementation EIS.
The responses to these combined and summarized comments are contained in the attached Responses to Comments section.
This section includes indices to help each commentor locate the response to his or her particular comment.
Finally, NPS has included copies of substantive comment letters received from all agencies and organizations (e.g., special interest groups, businesses, and academic institutions).
Corrections and Revisions to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement
The errata sheets are organized with the same headings as the draft EIS.
If there are no changes to a section, the headings are not repeated.
Corrections to the text are noted by page number, paragraph, and sentence.
A partial paragraph at the top of a page is counted as paragraph 1.
Sentences within a partial paragraph are numbered from the first complete sentence at the top of the page.
Material that has been deleted is shown by a [DEL: strikeout :DEL] and added text is underlined.
The phrase "change to read" means that text has been added or deleted.
The word "replace" indicates new phrasing for a sentence or paragraph.
"Add the following text" is used where text has been added to clarify a passage.
Typographical, spelling, and punctuation errors are not changed unless it is necessary to make the passage more understandable.

Therefore this EIS assumes that no costs associated with construction would be incurred.
The Department of the Interior does not consider No Action to be a viable option.
It is analyzed in the EIS for comparison purposed and because it is required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

Sand and gravel which formed the riverbed before the dams were built has eroded out to sea, [DEL: resulting in a lowered or degraded river channel :DEL] leaving an armor layer of cobbles and boulders along the bed of the river channel below the dams.
[DEL: This section of river channel is also "armored" with larger rocks (cobbles and boulders) and so moves at high river flows.
:DEL] The loss of riverbed material has severely degraded anadromous fish habitat, allowed vegetation to become firmly established on gravel islands and floodplains, and has reduced natural river [DEL: meandering :DEL]

Other mitigating measures are not required by a specific law but are recommended to [DEL: protect :DEL] maintain protection for downstream residents and structures.
Page 10, paragraph 4, sentence 1 change to read:
The dam removal process would also greatly increase turbidity (from a maximum of about 800 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs) now to as much as 25,000 NTUs) for short periods of time (a few days), suspended sediment and possibly dissolved manganese and iron stored in reservoir sediments for the [DEL: one to :DEL] two-year period during dam removal.
Groundwater

Riverbed aggradation would increase river stage in some places, and wells might be overtopped and contaminated.
Mitigation measures for Port Angeles, Dry Creek Water association, [DEL: and the Lower Elwha Tribal Fish Hatchery :DEL] are mandatory and would effectively eliminate impacts of dam removal to these users.
Even though not mandated by the Elwha Act, groundwater impacts to the Lower Elwha Tribal Fish Hatchery would also be mitigated, as a functional hatchery during removal is required to restore anadromous fisheries.

Spotted owl surveys to date have not found nests near either dam, with the closest being nearly one mile from Glines Canyon Dam.
As a result, adverse effects on northern spotted owls are not expected, although standard noise reduction techniques during dam removal may be employed to ensure murrelets and owls access to the river corridor and forest surrounding the dam sites.

Cultural resources in or near the floodplain may experience increased flooding or erosion from aggradation and increased surface water elevation during and following dam removal
Construction activities, road grading, trenching to bury the slurry pipeline and offsite disposal of dam rubble could damage known or unknown cultural resources
Draining the reservoirs and removing the dams may uncover cultural resources now inaccessible to members of the Low Elwha Klallam Tribe Construction-related impacts and mitigation of these impacts to the hydroelectric projects; to cultural resources now inundated or buried by projects, including the tribes cleansing site, prophecy hole, and creation site; to cultural resources potentially affected by waste disposal or road grading

If removed improperly, the dams may present a safety risk to workers, visitors, residents and others using the river corridor.
A failure of the fill under Elwha Dam due to hydrostatic pressure of the reservoir is of particular concern
Some hazardous wastes exist at the damsites, and may pose risk to health and safety of workers and the general public Risk and impacts posed to downstream residents by dam failure during shallow, deep and megathrust earthquakes
Risk of failure during probable maximum flood or maximum credible earthquake given safety and strengthening measures already taken
Impacts on and measures to protect workers, visitors, and others using the river corridor from sudden increases in water levels as dams are removed
Impacts on and measures to protect workers and the general public from exposure to hazardous wastes found in dam-related structures as they are removed Transportation Removing dam rubble, and transporting personnel, equipment and supplies in and out of the damsites would increase traffic volume and congestion at intersections Impacts on local road conditions from heavy equipment during dam removal
Impacts on level of service at key intersections and road corridors from increased traffic volumes during dam removal Indian Trust Resources The dams adversely affect the federal governments responsibility to protect tribal resources Impacts of dam removal and fisheries restoration and restoration of shellfish as a tribal resource by estuary expansion and return of sandy nearshore substrate
Impacts of restoring wildlife habitat for game
Elimination of dams as a potential safety hazard Recreation In the long term, water-related uses of the Elwha River valley would change from reservoir and river, to those associated with the river
Fishing would be restricted in short term, but would increase in the long term as salmon and steelhead return
Recreationists using the Elwha Sub-district of the park would need to find alternative locations during dam construction, because the sites would be closed to visitors Impacts on recreation facilities, including the reservoirs
Impacts on recreational fishing, including flat water, residential trout and sport fishing for salmon and steelhead
Impacts on other recreational activities, including white-water boating; recreational fishing; camping; hiking; recreational facilities and wildlife observation Land Use The hydroelectric facilities conflict with numerous agency plans, and do not conform with neighboring land use
Olympic National Park would acquire and manage lands now occupied by Lake Mills and Glines Canyon Dam facilities
Future land managers of the Lake Aldwell lands may use or develop the lands.
This use or development would affect vegetation, wildlife, air quality, cultural resources, recreation, traffic flow, aesthetics, water quality and/or fisheries
Rubble and other waste from dam removal would restrict future use of land Impacts to Olympic National Park from management of acquired Glines Canyon lands
Impacts from future management of Lake Aldwell lands on land ownership, use and resources if Olympic National Park, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington State or the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe acquires
Impacts from waste disposal Aesthetic Resources The appearance of uncovered reservoir land in the short-term is of concern
Long-term management of the restored landscape is important to visitors, recreationists, land managers, etc.
Impacts on project area landscape from removal of dams and related structures and restoration of the river corridor
Impacts on management of aesthetic resources after dams and reservoirs are removed
Planning Goals and Objectives
Page 40, paragraph 2, after sentence 2 add the following:

Note: The preceding cost estimates are refined from those contained in the restoration project programmatic FEIS.
These costs will be further refined when final project designs are developed.
Generally, these further refinements can be expected to reduce costs as design constraints become more certain and contingencies are reduced accordingly.
In addition, application of value engineering procedures have the potential to further reduce costs at the final design stage.
A less probable likelihood is that costs could increase due to some as yet unforeseen cost element.

Summary of Alternatives
NO ACTION RIVER EROSION
(Proposed Action) DREDGE AND SLURRY Dams Operation of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dam would continue.
Removal of features of both Elwha and Glines Canyon dams necessary to fully restore the ecosystem and fisheries of the Elwha River would occur over a 24-month period.
Same as Proposed Action
Sediment Management and Monitoring Sediment would continue to accumulate behind the dams.
Natural river processes would be allowed to erode the reservoir areas; Dam removal would be phased to reduce sediment levels during some periods to help protect fish; River sediment processes would be monitored to help control dam demolition rates.
Downstream suspended sediment concentrations would be reduced by dredging lakebed sediments and transporting through a slurry pipeline to the Strait of Juan De Fuca.
Dam removal phasing and monitoring would be the same as for the proposed action.
Flood Control No new flood control measures The Lower Elwha Federal Flood Control Levee would be raised and strengthened to maintain existing levels of flood protection.
Other flood control mitigation is recommended although not required by law.
Same as proposed action
Fisheries Fisheries partially maintained by hatcheries Hatchery support, outplanting, harvest management, and optimal timing of dam removal would be used to help protect anadromous fish populations during the dam removal process and accelerate full restoration.
Same as proposed action.
Revegetation No revegetation Reservoirs would be revegetated to restore pre-dam conditions and processes.
Same as proposed action
Water Quality Protection Filtration through aquifer and chlorination for municipal [DEL: and/or industrial supplies :DEL] supply Infiltration gallery and pre-treatment for industrial supplies; new Ranney well for municipal supply (including Dry Creek Water Association).
Other treatments (filtration, new wells, mounded septic system, raised wellheads, contingency funds etc.) recommended for EPHA, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe and individual well users.
Water quality facilities would generally be the same as the proposed action except that Fe/Mn treatment and filtration would not be required and the industrial pre-treatment would not be used intensively.
Disposition of Lands All project lands would remain in existing ownership (James River Corporation).
Lands acquired at the Glines Canyon Damsite would become part of Olympic National Park.
Aldwell lands would be managed by the park, Washington state or held in trust for Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe.
Same as proposed action
Interpretation No changes in interpretation.
Interpretation would include leaving parts of the Glines Canyon project in place, wayside exhibits explaining key historic events in the construction of the dams, physical and biological features, and documentation of dam removal and ecosystem restoration.
Same as proposed action
Cultural Resources No cultural resource mitigation occurs.
Cultural resource mitigating measures (avoidance, survey, documentation, monitoring) would occur in compliance with the Section 106 requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Same as proposed action except with additional measures to mitigate impacts of dredging and construction of the slurry pipeline.
Costs [DEL: $1.0 to 1.5 :DEL] $2.1 million per year to operate; [DEL: $8.7 :DEL]
[DEL: $127.4 :DEL] $130.1 million total cost over an 18-year period plus increased power cost for Daishowa.
Permitting It is unknown how FERC licensing would be resolved.
Litigation would probably resume.
Numerous federal, state, and local permits and review processes would be required.
Several permits required for compliance with Clean Water Act sections.
Same as proposed action except with additional reviews for construction and operation of the slurry pipeline.
Alternatives Considered but Rejected
Dam Removal
Page 78, after paragraph 4 add the following:
Phased Removal of Both Dams
During the comment phase on the draft Implementation EIS, Interior received several comments and a proposal to phase the removal of the two dams over a 13-year period.
The phased approach of removing Elwha Dam, allowing the river to "clean up" for a period of time, and then removing Glines Canyon Dam later, was evaluated early in the planning process by the EIS interagency team.
It was rejected as a reasonable alternative because of its unacceptable impacts on existing anadromous fish stocks, increased costs, and its delay in restoring the Elwha River ecosystem.
* Phased removal would lengthen the period of time fish would be adversely and significantly affected by increased sediment loads.
Sediment releases resulting from the removal of Elwha Dam would have a significant impact on aquatic life in the lower river for a period of 12 to 18 months.
By removing Glines Canyon Dam 6 to 7 years later, fish would be subjected to another 12 to 18 months of high sediment loads.
This phasing of dam removal would seriously threaten the long-term health of fish stocks remaining in the lower river, particularly chinook and chum salmon.
* Delaying the removal of Glines Canyon Dam for such a long period of time would in itself adversely affect Elwha anadromous fish stocks.
Habitat quality would remain poor below the dam, as sediment transport would remain blocked and water temperatures abnormally high in low flow months.
Higher quality upstream habitat would remain inaccessible.
Again, because many Elwha stocks are rapidly declining, this kind of delay in restoring the Elwha ecosystem would have significant adverse effects on anadromous fisheries.
* Separate dam removal contracts would cost more to prepare, administer and implement, and the inflation inherent in delaying dam removal would increase overall project costs.
* Phasing of dam removal would delay the release of sediments and nutrients from Lake Mills and the upper reaches of the Elwha River.
This would extend the period of time it would take to reestablish the natural hydrological, biological, and physical processes that are critical in restoring the Elwha River ecosystem and its anadromous fisheries.

Impact Summary Chart
IMPACT TOPIC NO ACTION RIVER EROSION
(Proposed Action) DREDGE AND SLURRY SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT Reservoir areas Reservoirs continue to trap sediments, (now 13.8 million cubic yards in Lake Mills and 3.9 million cubic yards in Lake Aldwell).
[DEL: 1.2-2.6 :DEL] 1.2-2.7 million cubic yards of coarse, and [DEL: 4.8-5.6 :DEL]
[DEL: 1.2-2.6 :DEL] 1.2-2.7 million cubic yards of coarse, and 1.2-1.4 million cubic yards of fine sediment would erode from reservoirs; remainder slurried to strait.
Downstream channel Reduced amounts of coarse-grained sediments (sand-size and larger) downstream of reservoirs, less meandering of river, armoring of river channel.
Fine-grained sediment and sand would move rapidly downstream, approaching background levels in 2 to 6 years; coarse sediments deposit and aggrade riverbed; more meandering and streambank erosion would be a beneficial impact Same as proposed action except less fine sediment eroding downstream (25% of total).
Delta, beaches and Ediz Hook Continued beach erosion, recession of delta and erosion of western edge of Ediz Hook and Angeles Point.
Re-establish sediment supply, rebuilding of beaches and delta within 3 years; begin to reverse erosion of Ediz Hook within 5-10 years.
Same as proposed action.
FLOODING Increases in water surface elevation, aggradation Degradation of riverbed has lowered flood stage in some places a beneficial impact to property owners and adverse impact to the rivers ecosystem; houses (except behind federal levee) and private wells along river flood at less than 100 year frequency flood event, a potential minor to major adverse impact.
Riverbed aggradation would cause increases in river stage of up to 4 feet; mandatory mitigation on federal levee and for municipal and industrial water wells would provide current level of flood protection; without recommended mitigation other areas may experience major impacts due to more frequent flooding (not significantly different than existing conditions);[DEL: short-term flooding impacts less than long-term impacts :DEL] .
Same as proposed action-dredging of fine sediments would have no additional impacts on flooding.

PH during dam removal 6.7 to 10.0 now; negligible impact.
5 to 9 minor change.
6 to 9.5 minor change.
Temperature (Celcius) during dam removal Reservoirs have resulted in increased peak temperatures to 19^o C. Major adverse impact to water quality/aquatic life 15^o C to 19^o C minor to major beneficial impact.
15^o C to 19^o C minor to major ^beneficial impact.
Dissolved oxygen during dam removal 95 to 110%; negligible or minor impact.

95 to 105% - minor change.
Long-term (from 1 year after dam removal) critical water quality indicators Total suspended solids in river Dams have reduced TSS concentration to less than 1,500 ppm; moderate beneficial impacts to water quality Average 69 parts per million within 2 years after dam removal moderate adverse impact.
Same as proposed action.
Turbidity Dams have reduced peak turbidity to 800 NTUs; moderate beneficial impact to water quality.
1 to 1000 NTUs within 2 years following dam removal moderate adverse impact 1 to 1000 NTUs within 1 year following dam removal moderate adverse impact.

NATIVE RESIDENT AND ANADROMOUS FISHERIES Long-term restoration No chance of restoring native anadromous fish in the Elwha River; genetic integrity of the existing native stocks deteriorates due to continued use of hatchery stocks; existing stocks in the lower river unsupported by artificial propagation would likely decline to extinction.
All Elwha River anadromous fish stock except sockeye salmon fully restored within 20 years.
Hatchery support, outplanting, harvest management, and optimal timing of dam removal could halve restoration time.
The long-term beneficial impacts would be the same as the proposed action except full restoration of native fish stock would occur in slightly less time.
Species-specific restoration potential No restoration.
The Elwha River could eventually produce an estimated 31,000 returning chinook salmon, 35,000 coho salmon, 274,000 pink salmon, 36,000 chum salmon, 10,000 steelhead, and 6,500 sockeye salmon per year.
Same as proposed action.
Short-term impacts Existing conditions, i.e. poor quality habitat, hatchery propagation and crowded spawning conditions would not change.
The release of fine sediment during and following dam removal would cause mortalities, physiological stress, or displacement of fish in the river for up to four years, and cause returning adults to avoid migrating up the river.
Hatchery support, outplanting, harvest management, and optimal timing of dam removal would help protect fish during this period.
The short-term adverse impacts of fine sediment on trout and salmon and their habitat would be reduced by removing as much as 75% of the fine sediments with a dredge and slurry pipeline in combination with other measures.
Direct fish losses and the risk of straying adults would be reduced.
Chinook salmon Same as above.
Direct fish loss caused by extreme sediment.
Hatchery support and outplanting would replace fish lost to high sediment levels and begin to reestablish stock in the middle and upper Elwha River.
Same as proposed action except the direct fish loss caused by high sediment levels would be less.

Riparian communities 5.3 linear miles inundated.
5.3 miles returned Same as proposed action.
Wetlands [DEL: 43 :DEL] 48 acres of vegetated wetlands, resulting from or enlarged by the higher water table would remain and 122 acres of unvegetated, riverine wetlands would remain lost; these losses have likely reduced biodiversity in the area.
Portion of 43 acres may be lost; 48 acres of vegetated and 122 acres of unvegetated wetlands would be restored Same as proposed action.
WILDLIFE Terrestrial habitat including elk and other mammals, trumpeter swans and other birds 715 acres of natural wildlife habitat would remain lost.
Without anadromous fish runs, critical to the wildlife community, natural biodiversity of the area would remain compromised.
Restoration of habitat and fish runs would be a major beneficial impact to most species including elk.
Species dependent on the reservoirs, including trumpeter swans, would lose habitat, but regional impacts would be minor.
Same as proposed action except for minor wildlife disturbances along the lower river while constructing the slurry pipeline.
SPECIES OF SPECIAL CONCERN Federally listed species: bald eagle, northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, Steller sea lion, and peregrine falcon Natural populations of salmon would remain unavailable to foraging bald eagles.
Up to 514 acres of potential habitat for spotted owls and murrelets would remain unavailable.
Sea lions and falcons would sustain continued minor impacts.
[DEL: Bald eagles, spotted :DEL] [DEL: owls, and :DEL]
Sea lions and falcons would experience minor beneficial and no impacts, respectively.
All impacts would be the same as the proposed action except: spotted owls and murrelets may be impacted from the noise of dredging activities.
[DEL: Impacts to foraging bald eagles would be slightly less, because turbidity and impact on fish as prey would be less.
:DEL] Candidates for federal listing including [DEL: Pacific fisher, harlequin duck, northern red-legged frog, and :DEL]
Over 5 linear miles of riparian and riverine habitat would remain unavailable for Pacific fishers and harlequin ducks.
Harlequin ducks and bull trout would sustain short-term, minor impacts.
All species would sustain major beneficial impacts in the long term.
Impacts to harlequin ducks and bull trout would be slightly less due to less turbidity in the river.
Species or stocks considered for federal listing: coho, chum and chinook salmon, steelhead, and se-run cutthroat trout Habitat for these species would remain unavailable, possibly contributing to the listing of these stocks under the Endangered Species Act.
All species would be adversely impacted in the short term, but over the long-term, restoration would offset some cumulative impacts occurring elsewhere in the region.
Same as proposed action.
Candidates for state listing including pileated woodpecker, Van Dykes salamander, and Vauxs swift Forest and riparian habitat for these species would remain inundated.
All species would sustain major beneficial impacts in the long term.
Same as proposed action.
LIVING MARINE RESOURCES Nearshore marine communities Existing marine communities would remain, the delta and estuary would be undersized, and clam populations would be lower than under pre-dam conditions.
Moderate adverse impacts would occur to local marine communities from silt and clay transported by the river.
A major change would occur, from transport of sand and gravel, in the substrate and biological community at the river mouth and to the east.
However, future conditions would approximate pre-dam conditions.
Same as proposed action.
AIR QUALITY Air quality Air quality is presently high quality and would stay this way.
The projects do not affect air quality.
Elwha Dam demolition would result in 105.3 tons of particulates and Glines Canyon Dam demolition, 25.2 tons over the [DEL: 18-month to :DEL] 2-year dam removal period.
Impact to local area would be minor, except from use of one-half mile of unpaved haul road, which would have moderate adverse impacts to residents without mitigation.
Sprinkling with water (required) would reduce impact to minor.
Same as the proposed action except trenching for pipeline may add minor amounts of PM[10] and TSP (particulates).
NOISE Continuous noise Noise from project negligible impact on residents or wildlife.
Residents of approximately 20 homes closest to (within 0.6 mile) the Elwha Dam would experience short-term minor increases in noise levels to as high as a typical office environment (about 58 decibels) under poor atmospheric conditions.
Residents further away would be unaware of day-to-day construction noise.
Noise levels for this alternative would be quantitatively indistinguishable from the proposed action.
The trenching operations required for pipeline laying and the pumping stations required to pump the slurried fines would result in minor noise that could have minor, short-term impacts on residents in the immediate vicinity.
Acute noise No blasting or other sudden loud noise exists in the vicinity.
Residents beyond 1.2 miles of blasting sites would not be expected to hear blasting noise.
The 20 residents within 0.6 miles of the Elwha Dam would periodically experience noise similar to moderate thunder.

Methodologies for Analyzing Impacts
Page 191, after paragraph 4 add the following:
coastal zone were evaluated by comparison to regional coastal processes.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers computer program HEC-6 was used to model riverbed aggradation during and following dam removal (BOR 1996c).
This moveable boundary model computes changes to and adjusts the cross section geometry and channel slope during the simulation.
For each time step, this model computes hydraulics, sediment transport, and corresponding changes to the riverbed elevations and bed material size distributions.
The model can compute vertical aggradation or degradation but cannot predict lateral changes.
The model computes vertical riverbed aggradation if the rate of upstream sediment supply is greater than the computed sediment transport capacity.
Sediment transport capacity, for a given flow and sediment size, is primarily related to river slope and velocity.
Both slope and velocities tend to increase with riverbed aggradation.
The Elwha River would respond to riverbed aggradation by evolving a steeper slope, not a flatter slope.
Therefore, the rate of aggradation should decrease with time as the channel geometry evolves to a point of stability with its increased sediment load.
Roughness coefficients (an indicator of the resistance to flow created by the channel bed and banks) in the model were greater for the floodplains than the main channel but were assumed to be constant with time.
These roughness coefficients were conservatively calibrated to low-flow conditions.

The US Army Corps of Engineers, which spends approximately $100,000 annually (January 1995 figures) to control further erosion of Ediz Hook, estimates that sediment supplied from the river before the dams were built was [DEL: between :DEL] 50,000 [DEL: and 80,000 :DEL]

and the coarser materials would tend to aggrade the riverbed.
Fine materials would be suspended and carried out almost immediately and most of the coarse grained materials would erode out more slowly in the months and years following dam removal.
In the channel, sand-sized material would be flushed quickly from the system, in months to a few years.
Gravel would take longer, appearing in measurable quantity throughout the lower river within two to six years.
Cobbles and larger sized material would take considerably longer to move through the system, possibly on the order of years to decades under average hydrologic conditions.

Following dam removal, it is possible that the river may migrate closer to the wells and remove some of the material that had previously filtered out these fine grained sediments.

a large portion of the particulate matter.
High turbidity in the river is therefore not usually reflected in water collected from the Ranney well.
However, if the river rises quickly following a prolonged drought, soil around the base of the Ranney collector caisson dries and cracks, allowing surface water to bypass the filtration provided by the riverbed.
During these "short-out" periods, turbidity in the Port Angeles municipal supply can be quite high.
The 1994 measured mean turbidity of 0.08 NTU (nephelometric turbidity units a measure of how [DEL: intensely :DEL] much light is scattered by particles in the water) normally does not exceed drinking water standards of 1.0 NTU.

thresholds would be exceeded were determined (see discussion below).
Richer modeling was used to estimate maximum sustained yield production and escapement for each species (FERC 1993).
These production numbers have been extensively reviewed and represent the best estimate of potential fish production.
The model incorporated data from field studies that determined the quality of fish habitat in the Elwha River conducted by a consultant for the project owner during the FERC relicensing process.
These habitat data were combined with average fish densities, such as smolts per square meter, and freshwater survival rates observed in other comparable Washington streams (e.g., S.F. Skykomish River for coho salmon, Dungeness River for Pink Salmon) to gauge carrying capacity for affected species.
Using the escapement needed to reach carrying capacity, average marine survival, and average freshwater survival, the total expected production of adult fish, by species, was calculated.

[DEL: northeast and sometimes northwest (Schwartz 1994).
:DEL] The US Fish and Wildlife Service in its Biological Opinion determined the marbled murrelet is likely to be adversely affected by the proposed project because of higher turbidity levels in nearshore marine waters during dam removal.
The impacts to foraging murrelets are not expected to be severe since the general direction of the tidal currents is away from the shoreline to the northeast and northwest, there are strong tidal currents, turbid Elwha River water would be diluted when it flows into the strait, and there is better foraging habitat west of the river mouth.
Page 279, paragraph 2, after last sentence add the following:
increases in turbidity.
Increased turbidity in marine waters, even with conservation measures, has the potential to adversely affect marbled murrelets in the short term.
Suspension of reservoir drawdown periods, November 15 to December 15, and May 1 to June 30, will be required as a mandatory condition of the Biological Opinion.

[DEL: Construction activity could adversely affect murrelets as they fly between the coast and their nest sites.
Although murrelets primarily follow the river on these daily forays, it is expected that localized activity at either damsite would simply be avoided and would not interrupt movement patterns.

The surveys indicated low numbers of birds traveling through the project area but no evidence of nesting in the vicinity of either dam, Lake Mills, Lake Aldwell, or associated access roads.
[DEL: Murrelet surveys are planned for 1996 to comply with US Fish and Wildlife Service survey protocol which requires two consecutive years of survey to assess murrelet presence at a particular location.
:DEL] Since the completion of these surveys have now verified that marbled murrelet nesting does not occur within the vicinity of the two dams, restrictions on dam removal activities to protect nesting murrelets pursuant to the Endangered Species Act would not be required.
