The resolution put in place a seven-month process at the end of which the Security Council will consider what action to take against states continuing to violate sanctions against UNITA.
It asks the secretary-general to set up a panel of five monitors to collect relevant information, investigate leads, and verify information provided by all sources on sanctions busting.
Between April and November interested states, including those mentioned in a 60-page report prepared by U.N. investigators and spearheaded by Angolan Sanctions Committee Chairman Ambassador Robert Fowler of Canada, can present information to the Sanctions Committee and demonstrate their adherence to the sanctions regime.
The report, which was given to the council in March, exposed the efforts of UNITA rebels to buy weapons to continue their war against the Angolan government.
The U.N. investigators told the council of secret deals with weapons brokers, of passport-sized packets of diamonds paying for children's schooling, of diamond smuggling and the work of UNITA operatives in some of the major capitals of the world.
They said that there was evidence that the former Zaire, Burkina Faso, Congo/Brazzaville, Rwanda, and Togo were sanctions busters.
The report detailed the involvement of countries in the region, the source of UNITA's arms and training and fuel supplies, how UNITA exchanged diamonds for commodities or cash, and how UNITA holds its assets.
It chronicled how inadequate arms export control regimes, largely in Eastern Europe, coupled with freewheeling air services, allowed UNITA to take delivery of weapons.
The document, entitled "Report of the Panel of Experts on Violations of Security Council Sanctions Against UNITA," outlined how UNITA is represented abroad, who represents the rebel group, and how they travel.
It also gives recommendations on how each of the sanctions violations can be stopped.
The resolution "does not name names or take action against alleged sanctions- busters," Sanctions Committee Chairman Fowler told the council April 18.
"The purpose of the resolution is, instead, to provide all states with an opportunity to answer the allegations of the expert panel, to end sanctions violations where they have occurred, and to bring their actions into conformity with the clearly articulated will of the international community."
"This resolution stipulates that the council will not continue to stand by while its decisions are flouted," Fowler said.
U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said that the vote "underscores the strong council view that UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi is in defiance of the will of the people he claims to represent.
The primary cause of the present crisis is Savimbi's unwillingness to comply with his obligations under the Lusaka Protocol."
"Mr. Savimbi should read the writing on the wall here in this meeting today," Holbrooke said.
"The noose -- as one of the previous speakers said -- is closing.
He should take action on his own to stop the pain and suffering he is causing to the people of Angola.
If he does not he will lose anyway, but at much greater cost to the people of Angola and to himself."
"Keeping sanctions pressure on UNITA will continue to erode Mr. Savimbi's military options.
Of course, this will not happen overnight," Holbrooke said.
Nevertheless, he pointed out that Fowler's investigation already has had an effect on Savimbi's ability to sell diamonds.
U.S. officials have said that the report clearly demonstrates a need for continued strengthening of sanctions, particularly in the areas of diamond sales, arms purchases, and foreign travel.
The resolution highlights the sanctions on UNITA regarding weapons, petroleum, diamonds, financial assets, and travel of UNITA officials; reminds states of their obligations; and calls upon states to undertake the necessary measures to ensure that the sanctions are observed.
Addressing the concern that illicit trade in diamonds is the principal source of funding for UNITA, the resolution encourages nations hosting diamond markets to impose significant penalties for dealing in UNITA diamonds.
It welcomed the steps taken by Belgium to ensure that UNITA diamonds are not traded in its diamond market.
