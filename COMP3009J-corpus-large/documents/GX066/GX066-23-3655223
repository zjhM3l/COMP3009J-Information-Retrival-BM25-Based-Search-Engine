It is comprised of 131.0 million boxes of early and midseason varieties and 100.0 million Valencias.
If realized, this crop will be three percent more than harvested in the previous season and only two million boxes less than the 1999-00 season.
In the previous ten seasons, the January forecast of all oranges has differed from final recorded utilization by an average of 2.6 percent.
Six seasons ended above the forecasted amount and four below ranging from 4.1 percent above to 6.0 percent below.
Until the last of December, weather had been mostly dry and warm.
Cooler weather and limited rainfall finally arrived in late December.
This is beneficial for continued harvest of the early and midseason crop and for tree protection should colder weather arrive later in the winter.

EARLY-MIDSEASONS UNCHANGED AT 131.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of early -midseason-Navel oranges is continued at 131.0 million boxes.
The Navel portion is continued at 5.6 million boxes.
The route survey conducted the last of December indicates about two-thirds of the rows harvested.
Estimated utilization of Navels is ahead of last season when a total of 5.1 million boxes were certified.
The early and midseason orange fruit sizes measured in December continue small and are the third smallest in the ten season average.
Droppage is now only slightly over the ten season average.
Although final month expansions show slightly less than the forecast would indicate, the first route survey (Row Count) of the season shows slightly more.
Almost 43 percent of the rows were harvested, the most in four seasons.
With weekly harvest amounts over 8 million boxes, January will be the peak month for early-mids.
VALENCIAS REMAIN 100.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of Valencias remains at 100.0 million boxes.
If realized, this will be larger than the previous three seasons and only four percent less than the record 104.0 million boxes in 1997-98.
Surveys conducted in December indicate fruit sizes, which had been projected slightly above the ten season average, now are projected to be slightly below.
Droppage however, is now projected to be below average.
These off-setting indications continue the expansions at near the same level as last month and October.
FCOJ NOW 1.58 GALLONS
The FCOJ yield for all oranges is increased from 1.55 gallons per box to 1.58 gallons of 42.0 degrees Brix concentrate.
The early and midseasons portion is projected at 1.52 gallons and the late (Valencia) portion at 1.68 gallons per box.
This is the first month the types have been projected.
If realized, the all orange yield will be the same as last season and above the 1999-00 season.
It is not a record however, which is 1.63 gallons in the 1998-99 season.
The early and midseason portion projection at 1.52 gallons is slightly less than last season's 1.54 but the Valencia portion is slightly higher at 1.68 projected versus last season's 1.65 final yield.
All projections of yield assume that processing relationships remain consistent with prior seasons.

GRAPEFRUIT CONTINUED AT 47.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of all varieties of grapefruit for recorded utilization is maintained at 47.0 million boxes (including a preseason allocation of 1.5 million boxes of gift fruit and other uses).
The forecast is divided into 19.0 million boxes of total white grapefruit and 28.0 million boxes of all varieties of colored grapefruit.
If the total forecast is realized, it will be two percent more than recorded last season, 12 percent below the 53.4 million box crop in 1999-00, and at the level of the 1998-99 season's crop.
In 1999 the Citrus Crop Estimates Advisory Committee requested that, in any season when economic abandonment is anticipated, an estimate of total available crop also be reported.
In October this season the survey data indicated that there would be a potential of 3.0 million boxes of the colored varieties that might not be harvested for economic reasons.
This amount was reduced to 1.0 million boxes last month and now appears to be even less than that.
The December surveys of fruit size and loss from droppage show that the projections for the white grapefruit are basically maintaining their path, with a moderate increase in the droppage rate and slight decrease in the growth rate.
These factors did not constitute sufficient change to affect the 19.0 million box forecast.
However, the colored varieties now compute to between 28 and 29 million boxes.
Loss from droppage continues the projected path to an historic average.
The major factor is the average fruit size.
The mean size through late December was smaller than any to the same period in the past 10 seasons, except 1992 and less than 25 seasons of the total 33 season series.
There is expectation that the growth rate of the remaining crops will not improve this season.
Estimated utilization through December 30, 2001, is 2.0 million boxes of white grapefruit as compared with 1.9 million boxes last season and 2.2 million boxes in 1999-00.
The colored grapefruit, using the same relationship, is 6.3 million boxes this season and 6.4 million boxes last season.
However, 7.2 million boxes had been used in the 1999-00 season.

ALL
TANGERINES
.4 MILLION BOXES The forecast of all tangerine varieties remains at 6.4 million boxes.
The current forecast is 14 percent above last season and is the second largest total crop of recorded tangerines.
The Early tangerines category forecast is 4.3 million boxes and is comprised of (in order of crop size) Sunburst, Fallglo, Robinson, and Dancy varieties.
Honey, the later maturing variety, is forecast at 2.1 million boxes.
Sunburst, the major variety of the early tangerines contributes over 80 percent to the early total.
Harvest is near complete.
This forecast is more than the final utilization of last season.
Harvest of Fallglo (the only other variety of volume in the early category) is complete.
Based on fresh certifications and allocations of processed, gift fruit and other use, utilization computes to about 30,000 boxes more than was recorded last season.
Robinson and Dancy contribute less than five percent of the early crop.
Honeytangerines, at 2.1 million boxes are forecast only 50,000 boxes more than recorded last season.
The average fruit size is at the record high for the series.
The loss from droppage is projected to be average at the 40 percent level from August to harvest.
Fruit droppage is the major factor in forecasting this crop.
Loss in the 10 season series, as of late January, ranges from 21 percent to 55 percent.
TEMPLES
STAY AT 1.4 MILLION BOXES The Temple forecast is continued at 1.4 million boxes.
Last season only 1.25 million boxes were recorded, that was the smallest crop of record since the series began in 1953-54.
If the forecast amount is harvested it will tie the second smallest crop since the 1989-90 freeze season.
The average fruit size through late December was the smallest in the 10 season series and only two Decembers in the 33-year series were smaller.
The loss from droppage to that point of time was slightly below the mean.
TANGELOS
HELD AT 2.3 MILLION BOXES The tangelo forecast at 2.3 million boxes is continued.
A route survey the end of December confirmed this level for potential utilization.
Almost 900,000 boxes are estimated to have been used by January 1, 2002.
K-EARLY CITRUS FRUIT
AT 30,000 BOXES The final estimate for K-Early Citrus Fruit is 30,000 boxes.
This is the smallest crop of record.

FRUIT SIZE COMPARISONS BY TYPES TO PREVIOUS SEASONS
Size frequency distributions are from the December size survey conducted in sample groves during the period of December 3 through 21, 2001.
The distributions are by percent from fruit within the size range of each 4/5 bushel container.
These percents relate only to fruit from spring bloom and exclude summer bloom fruit in all seasons.
