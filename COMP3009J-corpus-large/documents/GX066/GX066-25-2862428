If realized, this will be the third largest crop on record and 18 percent higher than last season.
The early- midseason and Valencia crop forecasts are unchanged.
In the past 10 non-freeze seasons, the February forecast has differed from final utilization by an average of 2.3 percent, with seven seasons above and three seasons below the recorded utilization.
The Row Count survey conducted January 25-26, 2000 recorded the lowest percent of rows harvested in the current ten year series, another indication that maturity is lagging this season.
Rainfall totals have been below average this winter and irrigation is being used to maintain good tree and fruit condition.
Recent cold fronts caused temperatures to drop into the 20s for short durations and any damage was insignificant.

EARLY-MIDSEASONS 127.0 MILLION BOXES The forecast of the early and midseason orange varieties is unchanged at 127.0 million boxes.
Objective surveys show fruit size has continued slightly above average and loss from droppage remained well below the average of the past nine seasons.
The Row Count survey, which has shown the percentage of harvested rows to be lower than in the nine previous seasons, now indicates harvested rows near 60 percent.
The rate of harvest has increased as estimated weekly utilization averaged over eight million boxes in recent weeks.
The Navel portion of the early-midseason crop is continued at 5.6 million boxes.
Estimated certifications through January 30 total over 4.0 million boxes.
The Row Count survey shows a sufficient number of rows remaining for harvest to support the current forecast.
VALENCIAS
.0 MILLION BOXES The forecast of Valencia oranges remains at 92.0 million boxes.
This forecast, 12 percent below the record of 104.0 million boxes in 1997-98, would equal the second largest crop recorded in 1996-97, and would be 25 percent above last season's final utilization.
Field measurements indicate that the fruit is above average in size and growth continues at a rate slightly above average.
Fruit loss from droppage remains well below average and is lower than any of the previous nine seasons.
FCOJ YIELD PROJECTIONS DOWN The all orange FCOJ yield projection is lowered to 1.54 from 1.57 gallons per box of 42.0 degree Brix concentrate, below the level of the past three seasons.
Also, projections for the components were decreased with the early and midseason portion at 1.48, down from 1.50, and the late (Valencia) portion at 1.64, down from 1.68 gallons per box last month.
Last season, the Florida Citrus Processors Association reported the record high yields of 1.58414 for early-midseason fruit, 1.74806 for the late maturing fruit, and 1.63381 for all oranges.
_________________________________________________________________
SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT CONTINUED
The total seedless grapefruit forecast is maintained at 45.5 million boxes.
This forecast was established in November 1999, reflecting estimated losses from Hurricane Irene.
The forecast is 1.0 million boxes less than recorded last season and the smallest indication since 41.2 million boxes utilized in the 1991-92 season.
Both varietal forecasts are maintained.
White seedless is 18.5 million boxes and the colored varieties total 27.0 million boxes.
Last season the final recorded utilization for whites was 17.8 million boxes and colored at 28.7 million boxes.
The January survey on fruit size indicated an average for both white and colored slightly below the past nine season mean.
The adjusted fruit loss survey showed white droppage at the nine season mean and colored slightly above.
The above average amount of "non-regular" blooms this season may be affecting both the average size and drop at this point in the season.
The route survey (Row Count) conducted on January 25-26, 2000, indicated a larger crop than the objective count surveys.
However, with only 21 percent of the rows harvested, it is not considered to be a reliable indicator.
The evaluation of the objective count surveys and the low harvest level did not indicate a change at this time.
Estimated utilization through January 30, 2000, was 4.1 million boxes of white seedless, the same as the past two seasons.
The colored varieties at 10.7 million boxes are lagging well behind the past two seasons.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT
The seedy (Duncan) grapefruit forecast is con- tinued at 500,000 boxes.
As of late January, fruit size was slightly above the nine season mean and loss from droppage several percent below.
However, this variety is only recorded as processed use and is dependent on load tickets at the plant.
Only 41,000 boxes were estimated to have been processed as of January 30, as compared with 107,000 boxes last season to that date.
Only 550,000 boxes were finally recorded last season.
Final recording of this crop has been less than 1.0 million boxes for the past three seasons.
ALL TANGERINES CONTINUED AT 6.6 MILLION BOXES
The total tangerine forecast is held at 6.6 million boxes.
There is no change in either the early portion at 4.2 million boxes or the late portion ( Honey) at 2.4 million boxes.
The early tangerines, Robinson and Fallglo, are complete.
Harvest of Sunburst and Dancy is rapidly declining.
The cooler weather has aided in holding quality.
The Honey tangerine harvest is underway with over 300,000 boxes estimated use through January 30, 2000.
This crop has more "off bloom" than normal, so that more spot picking has occurred.
The loss from droppage has been at the lowest level of the series.
However, fruit size is well below the mean.
The route survey (Row Count) indicated about 16 percent harvest of the regular bloom.
TEMPLES STAY AT 2.1 MILLION BOXES
The Temple forecast is maintained at 2.1 million boxes.
Less than 300,000 boxes had been recorded through January 30.
The crop has lagged in maturity and as usual has more later blooms than most citrus.
Fruit sizes average near the smallest in the series.
However, the droppage has been minimal, near the lowest of the series.
TANGELOS REDUCED 200,000 BOXES
The tangelo forecast is reduced to 2.6 million boxes based on the Row Count Survey the end of January.
Of the estimated use of about 1.5 million boxes approximately 65 percent of the rows had been harvested.
Estimated use as of February 1 was 16 percent below last season, when only 2.550 million boxes were recorded.
K-EARLY CITRUS INCREASED
The K-Early Citrus Fruit is now 100,000 boxes.
Processed use has continued to trickle in at a few thousand boxes in recent weeks.
The final estimate is less than recorded previous to 1997-98 but more than the past two seasons.

FRUIT SIZE COMPARISONS BY TYPES TO PREVIOUS SEASONS
Size frequency distributions from the January size survey are shown in the table below.
The distributions are by percent of fruit falling within the size range of each 4/5-bushel container.
Fruit sizes were measured on trees in sample groves during the period January 3 through 24, 2000.
Comparable sizes for 1998 and 1999 are also shown.
These measurements are of fruit from spring bloom and exclude summer bloom in all seasons.
