This forecast is 22 percent less than the record certified production of 244.0 million boxes last season.
The two forecast divisions are: early and midseason at 112.0 million boxes (including 4.5 million boxes of Navels) and late type (Valencia) at 78.0 million boxes.
The forecast is based entirely on tree counts, fruit counts, and measurements made by the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
The forecasts project the amounts of fruit utilized in certified fresh and processing form, including about one percent for non-recorded fruit.
Historically, all oranges have been utilized.
The all orange forecast is less than any season since 1993-94, when 174.4 million boxes were recorded.
During the past 10 non-freeze seasons, the October all orange forecast has deviated from final recorded utilization by an average of 3.5 percent.
Seven of the seasons have understated the forecast by an average of 2.6 percent and three overstated by an average of 5.5 percent.
Since January 1998, Florida citrus growing areas experienced some extreme weather conditions.
There were no damaging freezes.
However, the excessive rains of February through April had a negative effect during the bloom period.
Then the very dry, hot weather of May through July contributed to increased fruit shedding and lagging maturity.
Hurricane Georges in late September caused no damage to Florida citrus fruit or trees.

The data collection and sampling procedures used in all forecasts are identical with past seasons.
These are described on page six of this report.
Bearing trees include 1995 plantings (three years old at bloom time), as recorded in the 1998 Commercial Citrus Inventory, updated by one season of attrition.
There are 79.6 million trees used for expansion in this forecast, up 1.3 percent from last season's census revised tree numbers.
The Limb Count survey indicated the average fruit per tree for all oranges to be almost 24 percent less than last season.
The youngest bearing age group, consisting of three through five year old trees, comprises 11 percent of the trees, compared to 17 percent last season.
However, this age group only contributed three percent to the total fruit population (bearing trees times average fruit per tree) compared to six percent last season.
As fewer trees are being planted each year, the youngest age group is having less influence in total production.
All fruit having a diameter of at least 11/16 inch at count time was included in the forecast.
On the average, only three fruit per tree included in the counts (less than one percent) appeared to be of non-regular bloom (mid-April and later) and less than one fruit per tree was not included in the expansions.
This summer, the Limb Count survey was conducted from July 21 through September 18, 1998.
Details of the orange varietal division forecasts are explained on page two of this report.
FCOJ YIELD 1.57 GALLONS PER BOX
The all orange FCOJ yield projection is 1.57 gallons per box of 42 degrees Brix concentrate.
This is close to the record high yield recorded in 1992-93 at 1.57893.
Last season's yield as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association, was 1.57731, also slightly above this season's projection.
A projection of the early and late (Valencia) categories will be made in the January report.
All projections of yield assume processing relationships of the past several seasons.
Results of orange and grapefruit maturity testing with comparisons are found on pages three and four of this report.
_________________________________________________________________
EARLY AND MIDSEASON 112.0 MILLION BOXES
The early and midseason orange forecast (including Navels) is 112.0 million boxes.
This forecast is 20 percent less than last season's record large crop of 140.0 million boxes and over 16 percent below the previous record of 134.2 million boxes in 1996-97.
Excluding Navels, 37.1 million bearing trees were used in this forecast.
The sample average fruit count per tree (weighted by a 25 cell age/area matrix) was 21 percent less than last season.
However, it is only nine, three, and seven percent less than the preceding three seasons, respectively.
The early portion (mostly Hamlin) contributes 81 percent to the early-mid fruit population.
Although 35 percent of the bearing trees are less than nine years old, they are only contributing 18 percent to the fruit population.
Fruit set of the older trees is still the major forecast ingredient.
Average fruit size in September (measured in cubic inches) is about 10 percent less than last season.
However, the growth rate between August and September has been slightly above the average.
It is projected that it will take close to 10 more fruit than last season to make a 90 pound equivalent box at harvest.
Fruit loss from droppage until harvest is projected to be close to 10 percent which would be at the mean of the past eight seasons.
Droppage from the tree is the only factor used for loss and is relative for use in analysis.
Loss factors can vary with subsequent weather conditions and harvest patterns.
NAVEL ORANGES
.5 MILLION BOXES Navel oranges are forecast at 4.5 million boxes (included in the early-mid orange forecast).
This forecast is 29 percent less than the 6.3 million boxes utilized last season and 30 percent below the record high of 6.4 million boxes in 1996-97.
Trees show less than a one percent decrease from last season, at 3.0 million.
The fruit per tree is off 33 percent.
This crop experienced considerable bloom blight in March.
Even with lighter fruit set, the September average fruit size is significantly smaller than last season.
It is projected that it will take at least two more fruit to fill a 4/5 bushel carton at harvest.
Loss from droppage, mostly from fruit splitting, is above the mean level and it is expected that over 18 percent of fruit will be lost by harvest.
Because of significant differences in fruit set, size, drop, and harvest patterns of this variety from other oranges, a separate expansion is used as an add-on indicator in the early-mid and all orange forecasts.
VALENCIAS
.0 MILLION BOXES The 78.0 million box late type (Valencia) forecast is 25 percent less than the record large 104.0 million boxes recorded last season.
The indication is also below the preceding three seasons, but 16 percent above the 67.1 million boxes utilized in 1993-94.
There are 39.5 million bearing trees used in the forecast expansion, up two percent from last season.
The average fruit per tree is down 25 percent.
Weather conditions at bloom time and the incidence of bloom blight in many groves are considered factors in this low fruit set level.
There is negligible late or non-regular bloom in the forecast, only an average of two fruit per tree are in those categories.
Less than an average of one fruit per tree was too small to be included in the counts.
The mean fruit size in September was small and the volume (in cubic inches) was nine percent less than in September 1997.
However, the growth rate between August and September was slightly above average.
It is projected that it will take three more fruit to make a 90 pound equivalent box than last season.
Fruit loss from droppage is projected to be 17 percent, two percent more than the past seven season mean.
Fruit splitting has already been observed in some areas.
TEMPLES
2.0 MILLION BOXES The 2.0 million box Temple forecast is 11 percent less than the 2.25 million boxes recorded last season.
With the exception of three major freeze seasons (1957-58, 1962-63, and 1989-90), this is the smallest indicated crop since 1954-55, the first season Temples were separated from round oranges.
Removal of some older trees combined with 26 percent less fruit per tree has substantially reduced the fruit population.
Fruit sizes and droppage projections are slightly positive but did not offset the reduction in the population.
The amounts of non-regular and late bloom fruit included in the forecast are less than three percent of the total fruit counted, however, about eight percent was too small to be included in the forecast.
Last season 75 percent of the crop went into processed form.
TANGELOS
.5 MILLION BOXES The 2.5 million box tangelo forecast is 12 percent less than the 2.85 million box crop utilized last season.
It is at the level of 1995-96 but 37 percent below the 3.95 million box crop of 1996-97 which was the largest recorded crop since the 1987-88 season.
Bearing trees are down three percent from last season and the average fruit per tree is 11 percent less.
Fruit sizes have shown normal growth between August and September but the average is still below last season.
Fruit loss from droppage is above average for this time of year.
Last season, 68 percent of the recorded utilization was processed.

MATURITY
These are the second maturity tests of the 1998-99 season for all but the late oranges which are being tested for the first time.
Samples from the route surveys, which cover all five major citrus producing areas, were tested.
Sample size has remained constant for several seasons.
The grapefruit sample size began with 100, which included 50 samples each for the white and colored types.
Only one white grapefruit sample was picked at the time of this survey.
These samples were picked September 28 and 29 and tested September 30-October 2 in the Orlando test lab of the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
Only regular bloom fruit was picked for testing.
Rainfall during September was generally above average.
Hurricane Georges brought additional moisture to Florida's citrus belt near the end of the month.
The heavy rains during the month caused some of the early types of fruit to make rapid growth, resulting in varying amounts of fruit splitting in some groves.
All maturity levels are lagging behind last year at this same time.
The higher acid levels combined with the lower Brix have produced lower ratios and have contributed to a slower start for the fresh fruit packing houses.
The current pounds solids per box for fruit tested are lower than the past five seasons for early and late oranges and lower than the past four seasons for midseason oranges.

SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT 49.5 MILLION BOXES
The total seedless grapefruit forecast of final recorded utilization for the 1998-99 season of 49.5 million boxes is only one percent more than the 48.9 million boxes certified last season.
The varietal division is 18.0 for white seedless, as compared with 18.3 last season, and 31.5 for colored, as compared with 30.6 last season.
If realized, the white forecast will be the lowest certifications of any season since 1969-70.
The colored forecast is a record high indicator of utilization, exceeding the certification of 1996-97 by only 0.1 million boxes.
White bearing trees are down five percent using the new census and attrition.
The average fruit per tree is down 13 percent.
Projected fruit per box indicates six more fruit than last season and fruit droppage is estimated at 10 percent.
This forecast assumes a larger percentage of the total expansion will be utilized this season relative to last season, when an estimated 5.0 million boxes were economically abandoned.
The colored bearing trees are down almost three percent but average fruit per tree is up almost seven percent from last season.
Fruit sizes are projected at last season's level with droppage the same as white.
Colored harvest is expected to be closer to the expanded values than in the past three seasons affected by economic abandonment.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT
The seedy (Duncan) grapefruit forecast is 500,000 boxes.
This would be a record low utilization.
Last season, 650,000 boxes were certified.
Bearing trees are down 16 percent but average fruit per tree is up four percent.
Projected drop is the same as last season but fruit is the smallest of any recent season and will require about 20 percent more to make an 85 pound box.
ALL TANGERINES 4.2 MILLION BOXES
The all tangerines forecast of 4.2 million boxes is 19 percent less than the 5.2 million boxes recorded last season and 33 percent less than the 6.3 million boxes utilized in 1996-97.
Last season, the early varieties (Robinson, Fallglo, Sunburst, and Dancy) totaled 3.2 million boxes and Honeys totaled 2.0 million boxes.
Two divisions comprise this forecast: Early at 2.6 million boxes and Honey at 1.6 million boxes.
Early category allocations, in million boxes, are: Robinson, 0.250; Fallglo, 0.500; Sunburst, 1.800; and Dancy, 0.050.
Sunburst is the major variety and comprises 69 percent of the Early total.
The fruit population (bearing trees X average fruit per tree) is 20 percent less than last season.
At harvest, it is projected that it will take four more fruit to fill a carton than last season and loss from droppage will be about four percent more.
The newest commercial variety, Fallglo, also has a fruit population less than last season.
The combination of slightly more bearing trees (1.7 percent) is offset by 20 percent less average fruit per tree.
As with Sunburst, projected fruit size is less and droppage more.
The Robinson variety bearing trees and average fruit per tree are both less than last season.
However, it is projected that sizes will be larger and fruit droppage much less than last season.
The Dancy variety, which was the primary commercial tangerine years ago, is now the minor contributor.
There has been continued tree removal of the older more productive trees, which contributes to a reduced fruit population of less than a third of last season.
Even so, many of the Dancys are not projected to make fresh size 210 or larger at harvest.
Honey tangerines, the late maturing variety, at 1.6 million boxes are down 20 percent from last season and at the level of the 1995-96 season.
Both bearing trees and average fruit per tree are increased from last season, making the fruit population up 19 percent.
However, the major factors influencing the level of this crop are fruit loss from droppage and fruit size at harvest.
The results of the September surveys indicated that almost 21 percent of the fruit counted in August had already fallen from the established count limbs.
Although fruit sizes had good growth between August and September, the projection is that it will take 15 more fruit to make a 4/5 bushel carton at harvest.
K-EARLY CITRUS AT 60,000 BOXES
The K-Early Citrus Fruit forecast at 60,000 boxes is 20,000 boxes more than the record low use of 40,000 boxes last season but is the second lowest on record.
In 1996-97, 150,000 boxes were recorded.
LIMES 920,000 BUSHELS
The 1998-99 lime crop, first forecast in April 1998, is continued at 920,000 bushels (575,000 boxes).
This is 31 percent more than last season's 704,000 bushels (440,000 boxes).
Production is increasing as trees planted since 1992 are beginning to bear fruit.
5 _________________________________________________________________
FORECAST PROCEDURES FOR THE 1998-99 SEASON
All citrus forecasts except limes and K-Early Citrus Fruit are based on actual fruit counts and measurements.
These objective count methods utilize: (1) the bearing age tree population provided from the latest aerial photography with field verifications; (2) the average fruit per tree obtained from the fruit count survey using randomly selected trees and limbs; and (3) the fruit measurement and fruit drop count surveys to determine fruit sizes and loss from fruit droppage.
The 1998 Commercial Citrus Inventory is the base used to determine forecast tree numbers for the 1998-99 season.
All trees planted in 1995 and earlier are included.
An attrition factor by age and area was applied to these base numbers to account for tree losses since the inventory period.
The same unbiased fruit count procedures were used as in all of the past 41 seasons.
These include drawing the sample with known probabilities from the Commercial Citrus Inventory based on analyses of the variability in fruit per tree.
Using random path procedures, count limbs on sample trees are preselected to improve accuracy.
Fruit on these limbs are counted in the late July to mid September period.
Fruit size surveys were conducted in August and September.
The fruit loss surveys (drop count) were begun in August.
These surveys, along with historical records, were used to project the fruit size at harvest and the fruit population that is expected to remain on trees at harvest.
The chart below describes the relationship of the September 1998 early and midseason orange (excluding Navels) fruit size measurements with those taken in September 1997.
The diameter measurements shown are the minimum values of each eighth inch range, except for the smallest values.
FRUIT SIZE: Early and midseason oranges (excluding Navels) size frequency by diameter from September measurements.
chart: early-midseason orange size frequency
Size frequency distributions developed from the September size survey are shown in the following table.
The distributions are by percent of fruit falling within the size range of each 4/5-bushel container.
These frequency distributions relate to fruit from regular bloom and exclude summer bloom in all years.
