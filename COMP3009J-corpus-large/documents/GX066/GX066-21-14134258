Comprising this forecast are the early and midseason oranges with a final harvest of 140.0 million boxes and the Valencia oranges with an estimate of utilization continued at 108.0 million boxes.
While this forecast has been trimmed 6.0 million boxes during the season, it continues at a record level, surpassing the previous season's record crop of 226.2 million boxes by nearly 10 percent and the 1995-96 crop by 22 percent.
EARLY AND MIDSEASONS FINAL AT 140.0 MILLION BOXES The estimate of early and midseason orange utilization (including Navels) is final at 140.0 million boxes.
Although four percent lower than the initial forecast in October, this crop attained a record level for the fourth consecutive season.
At 6.3 million boxes, the Navel portion of the crop is second only to last season's record 6.4 million boxes and exceeds the 1995-96 crop by 20 percent.

VALENCIAS REMAIN 108.0 MILLION BOXES
The Late type (Valencia) orange
is maintained at 108.0 million boxes.
This forecast has been in effect since the initial level was established last October.
The amount is 17 percent above last season's record high crop of 92.0 million boxes.
It is over 37 percent larger than the 1995-96 crop of 82.1 million boxes.
The route survey (Row Count) conducted on June 3-4, 1998 expanded to the forecast, with about 11 percent of the rows still unharvested.
The percent harvest is more than last season but less than the preceding 2 seasons.
The recorded boxes were over 17 million more than harvested to the same date last season.
It is expected that weekly harvest will decline rapidly as many processing plants will try to close as soon as possible, with a few continuing to run until late June.
A survey of all processors was conducted to report the usage of late type oranges to May 31, 1998 and the anticipated remaining volume.
The results combined with fresh use computed to the forecast amount.
Fresh use and unrecorded gift fruit and other use comprises slightly over 3 percent of the crop.
FCOJ REMAINS AT 1.58 GALLONS PER BOX The projected all orange FCOJ yield is held at 1.58 gallons of 42.0 degrees Brix concentrate.
As of May 30, the average yield for all oranges going into concentrate was 1.573482 gallons per box as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association.
The report also states that 225.8 million boxes have been processed of which 157.4 million boxes have been used in frozen concentrated orange juice.
This utilization for all orange FCOJ is second only to the record year 1979-80.
The projected season average yield for the late type (Valencia)
oranges has been raised to 1.72 gallons per box.
The latest report from the Citrus Processors shows the Valencia season average yield to date is 1.713215 gallons per box from 57.7 million boxes.
The previous record for Valencia oranges going into concentrate was set in the 1991-92 season with a yield of 1.69608 gallons per box.
The early and midseason portion of this season's crop was final at 1.492548 gallons per box.

SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT ADJUSTED TO 48.85 MILLION BOXES The all seedless grapefruit forecast is adjusted 450,000 boxes upward to 48.85 million boxes.
This consists of 18.25 million boxes of white seedless, down from 18.4 million boxes last month and 23.0 million boxes in October, and 30.6 million boxes of colored varieties, up from 30.0 million boxes last month and 30.5 million in October.
These forecasts are a projection of final seasonal utilization of each crop, based on utilization to date relationships to past seasons.
With the hot weather, many available crops of white seedless are rapidly becoming useless for processing.
Weekly utilization of both white and colored varieties has declined rapidly for both fresh and processed usage.
Estimated utilization of white seedless grapefruit to June 1 is almost 18 million boxes.
Fresh utilization is the lowest since the 1989- 90 freeze affected season.
Economic conditions in the primary markets and poor quality have led to this reduced amount.
Processing utilization is also very low reflecting the lack of demand by processors caused by large inventories of FCGJ.
Utilization of colored varieties for fresh shipments is the lowest in several seasons but processing utilization is the highest on record.
This reflects the strong demand for colored juice especially for not from concentrate (NFC) usage.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT INCREASED
The forecast of seedy grapefruit is adjusted from 600,000 boxes last month to 650,000 boxes.
Estimated utilization to June 1 is 615,000 boxes with weekly amounts declining rapidly.
All seedy grapefruit is processed and this is the lowest utilization of this crop in history.
ALL TANGERINES NOW 5.2 MILLION BOXES EARLYS FINAL AT 3.2 MILLION HONEYS FINAL AT 2.0 MILLION
The all tangerine forecast is adjusted to 5.2 million boxes from 5.25 last month.
The early portion ( Robinson, Fallglo, Sunburst, and Dancy) is final at 3.2 million boxes.
This is almost 30 percent less than was utilized last season.
The Honey tangerine portion is adjusted downward to 2.0 million boxes from 2.05 million last month.
This is 11 percent more than the 1.8 million boxes used last season.
Small amounts of late bloom fruit are available but harvest of most regular bloom crops is complete.
TEMPLES FINAL AT 2.25 MILLION BOXES
Temple utilization is final at 2.25 million boxes.
This is six percent less than last season when 2.4 million boxes were harvested.
Utilization during the past seven seasons has averaged 2.39 million boxes, ranging from 2.15 to 2.55 million boxes.
TANGELOS FINAL AT 2.85 MILLION BOXES
Tangelo final utilization is 2.85 million boxes.
The route survey indicates some fruit still remaining, mostly as pollinators in tangerine blocks that will not be used.
Last season's recorded crop of 3.95 million boxes was the largest since 1987-88.
K-EARLY CITRUS FINAL AT 40,000 BOXES
Original survey indications in October were for 130,000 boxes but only 40,000 boxes have been certified.
There has been very limited demand for this fruit and virtually none was used for processing.
