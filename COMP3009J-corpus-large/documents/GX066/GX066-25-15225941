The early and midseason portion of the total is estimated to be final at 128.0 million boxes.
The late type (Valencia) forecast is continued at 100.0 million boxes.
If the total is attained, this will be the third largest crop produced in Florida but only two percent more than the 223.3 million boxes utilized last season.
In the previous 10 seasons, the April forecast has differed from the final recorded utilization by an average of 1.1 million boxes, with three seasons above the actual production and seven below.

TOTAL EARLY AND MIDSEASON ORANGES FINAL AT 128.0 MILLION BOXES
The 2001-02 final estimate of all varieties of early and midseason oranges rounds to 128.0 million boxes.
The Navel orange variety, included in the total, was adjusted to 5.5 million boxes from the 5.6 million boxes forecast since October.
The route survey (Row Count) conducted on March 27-28, 2002, indicates that only a few rows remain for harvest, which will not be sufficient to affect the total.
VALENCIAS
STAY AT 100.0 MILLION BOXES The late type (Valencia) orange forecast is continued at 100.0 million boxes.
The March survey of fruit size shows a larger average than last month and slightly more than had been projected to that survey date.
The average is now still below the mean of the past 11 seasons and only slightly larger than last season.
The March survey of loss from fruit droppage indicates an average of two percent below the 11-season mean.
The combination of these factors sustained the forecast level.
The Row Count conducted the end of March shows a greater percentage of harvested rows than the preceding two seasons to the same date.
This season is about three percent more than the 10-season mean.
At the relative small percent harvest at this time each season, the survey is not considered a forecast indicator.
Estimated utilization to April 1, 2002, is considerably above the last two seasons.
Maturity of many of the crops is allowing earlier volume harvest and it is expected that these harvest patterns will continue.
FCOJ CONTINUED AT 1.58 GALLONS
The projected yield for all oranges going into FCOJ is unchanged from last month at 1.58 gallons per box of 42.0 degrees Brix.
The early and midseason portion is final at 1.527736 gallons per box as reported by the Florida Citrus Processors Association report # 26.
The Valencia orange yield is unchanged from last month at 1.68 gallons per box.
The Maturity Test Results on page 3 of this report show the pounds solids per box for Valencias at 7.15 which is the second highest April 1 pounds solids in the past 10 years.
LIME UTILIZATION
The just completed 2001-02 lime season estimate of total utilization is 240,000 bushels (150,000 88 lb. boxes).
There is no forecast of utilization for the 2002-03 season.
See page 4 for details.

GRAPEFRUIT STAYS AT 47.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of all varieties of grapefruit for recorded utilization stays at 47.0 million boxes (including a preseason allocation of 1.5 million boxes of gift fruit and other use).
The forecast continues to be divided into 19.0 million boxes of total white grapefruit and 28.0 million boxes of colored grapefruit.
If the forecast amount is harvested, it will be two percent more than recorded last season, 12 percent below the 53.4 million boxes in 1999-00, and at the level of the 1998-99 crop.
The largest recorded crop of all varieties of grapefruit was 55.8 million boxes in 1996-97 which excluded 6.0 million boxes of estimated economic abandonment.
The March survey is the season's final objective count measurement of average fruit size and loss from droppage for the remaining seedless grapefruit crops.
Current fruit size continues to be the smallest in the nine year series and the average did not increase from last month.
Loss from droppage increased to above last season's, for this time period, but is still below the nine-season mean.
The combination of these factors continues to indicate the forecast level for recorded utilization.
The route survey (Row Count) conducted on March 27-28, 2002, shows more than 60 percent of the rows of both categories have been harvested.
At this harvest level, the survey becomes a forecast indicator.
The white percent is 10 percent above last season but seven percent below the 10-season average.
The colored percent is three percent more than last season but, also, seven percent below the average.
Analysis indicates that the remaining rows will provide sufficient fruit to achieve the forecast.
Estimated utilization through March 31, 2002, for white is at the 12.9 million box level, 1.0 million boxes more than last season, but behind the 14.0 million boxes of two seasons ago.
Colored at 20.5 million boxes is almost identical with the certified use to the same date last season, but 2.0 million boxes less than recorded in 1999-00.

ALL TANGERINES NOW 6.6 MILLION BOXES
The forecast of all varieties of tangerines is raised 0.2 million boxes, to 6.6 million boxes, with the increase entirely in the later maturing, Honey, portion of the crop.
The forecast is 18 percent higher than last season's 5.6 million boxes.
If realized, it will be six percent less than the record high crop of 7.0 million boxes used in 1999-00.
The Early tangerine category is estimated to be 4.3 million boxes.
This category consists of Robinson, Fallglo, Sunburst and Dancy varieties.
Harvest of these varieties is almost over, with only a few boxes of Sunburst and Dancy still being certified.
The fresh certifications are designated by variety and the million box equivalents are as follows: Sunburst - 2.000, Fallglo - 0.512, Robinson - 0.062, and Dancy - 0.003.
Processed Early tangerines at 1.5 million boxes are not certified by variety.
Honey tangerines, the only later maturing variety, is increased to 2.3 million boxes.
The latest Row Count survey shows 88 percent of all the "regular bloom" rows harvested.
However, based on the estimated certifications through March 31, 2002, including the preseason allocation of 0.1 million boxes of unrecorded gift fruit and other use, the March forecast of 2.1 million boxes is close to being attained.
Weekly estimated utilizations have held relatively constant for the past month at the 0.150 level, but should decline rapidly.
Utilization through March 31, 2002, is more advanced than the last two seasons to the same date.
If the forecast is attained, it will be 12 percent above the 2.050 million boxes recorded last season but 13 percent less than the record large crop of 2.650 million boxes in 1999-00.
TEMPLES REMAIN AT 1.5 MILLION BOXES
The Temple forecast is held at 1.5 million boxes.
The Row Count survey percent harvested and the movement to that date are the supporting indicators for the forecast level.
Harvested rows total more than last season and the estimated utilization through March 31, 2002, is 0.150 boxes more than last season.
Only 1.250 million boxes were recorded last season, the least amount in the historic series.
In the past 10 seasons, an average of almost 70 percent of Temples have been used in processed form.
TANGELOS ADJUSTED TO 2.15 MILLION BOXES
The tangelo forecast is reduced 0.05 million boxes to 2.15 million boxes.
The downward adjustment is based on the estimated utilization of 2.130 million boxes to April 1, 2002, including 0.2 million boxes of allocated gift fruit and other use.
Only a few thousand boxes were certified in the past month.
The Row Count survey still shows more than 20 percent of the potentially harvestable rows unpicked.
The past five-season average shows that 69 percent of those crops were used in processed form.

2001-02 LIME UTILIZATION
Utilization of Florida's 2001-02 lime crop, which finished harvest March 31, is estimated at 240,000 bushels (150,000 88-lb. boxes).
At the request of the Lime Administrative Committee, inspection and certification of limes ended February 19, 2002.
At that time, 195,600 bushels had been reported certified for the season which began April 1, 2001.
Very limited amounts were shipped for the remainder of the season.
The introduction of citrus canker into the lime producing area resulted in the destruction of many lime trees.
Bearing acreage is estimated at 800 acres with most of this in Miami-Dade County.
The Lime Administrative Committee has voted to temporarily suspend the inspection and certification of limes.
Consequently, there is no forecast of utilization for the 2002-03 lime season.
