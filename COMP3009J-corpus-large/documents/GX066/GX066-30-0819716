The reduction is entirely in the early and midseason portion of the crop.
The early-mid final estimate is 140.0 million boxes.
The late type (Valencia) forecast remains at 108.0 million boxes.
The all orange forecast is two percent below the 254.0 million box forecast made in October 1997.
If realized, this crop will surpass last season's record high utilization of 226.2 million boxes by nearly 10 percent and the 1995-96 crop by 22 percent.
EARLY AND MIDSEASONS FINAL AT 140.0 MILLION BOXES The estimate of the 1997-98 early and midseason orange crop (including Navels and a pre-season allocation for gift and unrecorded uses) is 140.0 million boxes, four percent less than projected in October.
This is 3.0 million boxes less than last month's forecast of 143.0 million boxes.
Navels constitute 6.3 million boxes of the estimate, down 16 percent from the 7.5 million boxes projected in October.
This crop is a record high, exceeding last season's record by four percent.
The Navel portion is the second largest on record, within two percent of last season's record 6.4 million boxes.

VALENCIAS
STAY AT 108.0 MILLION BOXES The late type (Valencia) orange forecast is continued at a record 108.0 million boxes.
This harvest, if realized, is 17 percent above last season's record of 92.0 million boxes and over 31 percent greater than the 1995-96 crop.
The March final size and drop survey indicated that the average fruit size was slightly less than projected in October.
The accumulated loss from droppage was virtually unchanged from the October projection.
The row count survey of April 1 indicated almost 27 percent harvested.
Although this survey indication (rows harvested vs. utilization to date) is not considered a prime indicator until near 50 percent harvest, the computation supports the forecast.
FCOJ REMAINS AT 1.56 GALLONS PER BOX The estimated final yield for all fruit going into FCOJ is unchanged from last month at 1.56 gallons per box of 42.0 degrees Brix concentrate.
In report No. 22 by the Florida Citrus Processors, the early and midseason portion of the crop was final at 1.492548 gallons per box.
The yield for late season oranges has increased and is now projected at 1.67 gallons per box.
Some young tree Valencia oranges may have been included in the early portion of the FCOJ, possibly depressing that yield slightly.
Valencias did not follow the historic pattern of a early season dip in the yield.
Instead, weekly reports show the yield continuing to rise possibly reflecting the inclusion of more than normal very old, high yielding, midseason seedling oranges going into the late juice reports.
Report No. 26 from the Processors shows 116.3 million boxes used for all oranges, yielding 1.514888 gallons per box.
Through report No. 4, the processors have used a record 16.7 million boxes of Valencias, yielding an average of 1.648279 gallons per box.
1998-99 LIMES 920,000 BUSHELS The 1998-99 lime crop is forecast at 920,000 bushels (575,000 88-lb. boxes).
The just completed 1997-98 season total estimate of utilization is 704,000 bushels (440,000 boxes).

SEEDLESS GRAPEFRUIT CONTINUES AT 49.5 MILLION BOXES
The all seedless grapefruit forecast remains at 49.5 million boxes.
White seedless is forecast at 21.0 million boxes and the colored varieties remain at 28.5 million boxes.
Both fresh and processed utilization of the white variety is lagging behind last season to the same date.
Weather and weak market conditions for export have contributed to reduced movement in the fresh area.
High winds have also accelerated droppage in some of the older interior area white groves.
Final recorded utilization of this variety will be dependent on the amount processors are willing to accept into inventory.
Last season proces sors took 17.8 million boxes on a total white utilization of 23.5 million boxes, or over 75 percent of the crop.
The white forecast is now over 10 percent less than last season's crop.
If realized, it will be the smallest crop recorded since the 1991-92 season and the third smallest in a twenty year series.
Colored seedless varieties are forecast at 28.5 million boxes, unchanged from last month.
This forecast is nine percent less than the record crop utilized last season, but at the level of utilization in the 1994-95 and 1995-96 seasons.
Estimated utilization of colored as of April 1, 1998, is about 1.3 million boxes ahead of last season to the same date.
These forecasts are based on objective fruit count and measurement surveys in relation to the harvest patterns and utilization of the past six seasons.
All citrus forecasts project certified utilization and include a preseason allocation of less than two percent for unrecorded usage.
Certifica tions include only fruit actually shipped in fresh pack or recorded at a processing plant.

SEEDY GRAPEFRUIT FORECAST HELD
The seedy (Duncan) grapefruit forecast is continued at 500,000 boxes.
As of April 1, 1998, almost 500,000 boxes are estimated to have been utilized.
Loss from droppage accelerated last month, possibly the result of wind and rain.
All seedy grapefruit is certified in processed form and the total amount depends on load ticket classification.
EARLY TANGERINES FINAL AT 3.2 MILLION BOXES HONEY TANGERINES INCREASED
The early portion of the tangerine forecast ( Robinson, Fallglo, Sunburst, and Dancy) is final at 3.2 million boxes.
This is almost 30 percent less than was utilized last season.
The Honey tangerine (late portion) is in creased to 1.9 million boxes.
Estimated utilization is over 200,000 boxes ahead of last season, when 1.8 million boxes were recorded, reflecting slightly advanced maturity.
The row count survey on March 30-31 showed over 20 percent of the rows remain to be harvested.
TEMPLES HELD AT 2.3 MILLION BOXES
The Temple forecast is continued at 2.3 million boxes which is 100,000 boxes less than utilized last season.
Although harvest of this crop started earlier than last season, estimated certifica tions as of April 1, 1998, are less than last season's level to the same date.
The row count survey supports this forecast.
TANGELOS FINAL
The estimate of tangelo utilization is final at 2.85 million boxes.
Weekly utilizations have de clined steadily.
The route survey indicated some rows still remaining, mostly in small blocks or as pollinators.
Last season's recorded crop of 3.95 million boxes was the largest since 1987-88.
K-EARLY'S FINAL AT 40,000 BOXES
Original survey indications were for 130,000 boxes but only 40,000 boxes have been certified.
There has been very limited demand for this fruit and virtually none for processing.

1998-99 LIMES FORECAST AT 920,000 BUSHELS
Florida's 1998-99 lime crop, which began harvest April 1, is forecast at 920,000 55-pound bushels (575,000 88-pound boxes).
This is 31 percent more than the 704,000 bushels (440,000 boxes) produced in the just completed 1997-98 season.
Production has increased each season since the low of 320,000 bushels produced in the season following hurricane Andrew.
Trees planted in Dade County since the storm are producing good quantities of fruit.
Bearing acreage statewide is estimated to be 2,700 acres, the same as last season but up from 1,900 acres following the storm in 1992.
All of the newly planted acreage is in Dade County with other counties losing some acreage to cold weather in January 1997.
