This forecast is comprised of 127.0 million boxes of early and midseason oranges (including Navels) and 102.0 million boxes of late type (Valencia) oranges.
If realized, this crop will be two percent below the 233.0 million boxes harvested last season.
Indications from the objective surveys support the current forecast.
In the past 10 seasons, the January forecast has deviated from the final utilization by an average of 2.9 percent.
Six seasons were above the final utilization and four were below.
This January forecast does not reflect any effects of the freezing temperatures that occurred in parts of Florida's citrus belt the last week of December and the first week of January.
All surveys used for this forecast were completed before the freezing temperatures arrived.
Florida Agricultural Statistics Service will conduct a freeze damage survey on January 18 to observe effects of freezing temperatures.
Information from this special survey will be reported in the Crop 
The next scheduled citrus production forecast on February 8 will reflect any effects of the freezing temperatures on production.
The freeze damage survey will observe Valencia oranges only as the early and midseason crop is mature and will be more than 50 percent harvested by January 18.

EARLY-MIDSEASONS 127.0 MILLION BOXES
The early and midseason forecast remains unchanged at 127 million boxes.
If realized, this will be the fourth largest early-mid crop and five percent less than last year's 134 million box crop.
The Navel forecast is final and remains unchanged at 5.5 million boxes.
The route survey conducted on December 26-27 showed Navels were nearly 69 percent harvested.
Objective count surveys completed in late December indicate early and midseason oranges had record low droppage rates and the smallest sizes in the past ten years.
The route survey indicated about 38 percent of the early and midseason oranges had been harvested by the end of December.
Survey indications support the current production forecast.
VALENCIAS 102.0 MILLION BOXES
The Valencia forecast remains unchanged at 102.0 million boxes.
Fruit sizes continue below average, as projected, while fruit loss from droppage is currently at the lowest level in recent history.
If realized, this crop will be the second largest on record, two million boxes less than the record 1997- 98 crop of 104.0 million boxes.
FCOJ 1.55 GALLONS PER BOX
The yield for all oranges going into FCOJ is projected at 1.55 gallons per box of 42.0 degrees Brix concentrate.
The early and midseason portion is projected to yield 1.51 gallons per box and the late season Valencia oranges are at 1.62 gallons.
These yields per box are considerably behind the all time records set during the 1998-99 season when the all orange yield was at 1.63381, the early-midseasons yielded 1.584139 gallons and the Valencias yielded 1.714806 gallons.
The Brix, pounds of unfinished juice, and pounds solids per box are all considerably ahead of last year's off-bloom fruit.
This year's fruit are mostly smaller than average size, which generally produces more juice per 90 pound box..
These projections of yield are based on the assumption that harvest patterns and utilization by the processors will be similar to past several seasons.
The results of the January 1 maturity test are on page 3.

TOTAL GRAPEFRUIT STAYS AT 50.0 MILLION BOXES
The forecast for all Florida grapefruit is continued at 50.0 million boxes.
The divisions of all white seedless, at 20.0 million boxes and the colored varieties, at 30.0 million boxes are maintained.
The total forecast is 10.4 percent below the record large crop of 55.8 million boxes estimated in the 1996-97 season and six percent less than the recorded use of 53.4 million boxes last season.
The December survey shows fruit sizes continue to increase.
However, the white seedless is still close to the mean of last season in December but below the last 10 season average.
The colored varieties average is below last season when the average was on the small side and continues to be well below the 10 season mean.
This relationship was basically as had been projected for earlier forecasts.
The December survey that measures loss from fruit droppage since August for both the white and colored continues to indicate the least amount of loss in the 10 season average through the same period.
Loss for both varieties has been less than half that recorded last season.
The cool, dry weather since November, which undoubtedly has limited the growth factor in the past months, has also prevented any excessive loss from droppage.
Estimated utilization to January 1 of white grapefruit was 1.8 million boxes, as compared with 2.2 million boxes last year.
The colored varieties totaled 6.2 million boxes to the same date, as compared with 7.2 million boxes last year.
All citrus forecasts project the final certifications of commercial fresh and processed use, including about three percent for unrecorded other uses.

ALL TANGERINES NOW AT 6.2 MILLION BOXES
The forecast for all varieties of tangerines is lowered 0.1 million boxes to 6.2 million boxes.
The Early varieties, consisting of Fallglo, Robinson, Sunburst and Dancy, are continued at 3.7 million boxes.
Honey, the late maturing variety is now 2.5 million boxes.
The Fallglo and Robinson varieties have been harvested and Sunburst is well underway.
Harvest of the relatively small quantity of Dancy has just begun.
As of January 1, estimated certifications of all the Early varieties is 2.9 million boxes, as compared with 3.4 million boxes last season to the same date.
Last season's total recorded use was 4.35 million boxes.
The late tangerine variety, Honey is lowered 0.1 million boxes to 2.5 million boxes.
The December surveys of fruit sizes and loss from droppage indicate the downward revision.
The fruit sizes as of mid-December were above the 10 season average and well above last December.
However, the loss from droppage was 28 percent from the known population of the count branches in August.
This is projected for a seasonal loss close to the 10 season mean and substantially more than the minimum seasonal loss of only 22 percent last season.
TEMPLES REMAIN AT 1.8 MILLION BOXES
The Temple forecast is maintained at 1.8 million boxes.
The December surveys of fruit sizes and loss from droppage continued to indicate the projections made earlier.
The average fruit size is below last season and close to the minimum size in the 10 season series.
Loss from droppage continues to be above last season and the mean of the series.
The small fruit sizes and high droppage are part of the reasons that the forecast is almost eight percent below the recorded use for last season.
Bearing trees are down as well as the average fruit per tree.
In the 1979-80 season 6.0 million boxes of Temples were recorded.
TANGELOS HELD AT 2.1 MILLION BOXES
The forecast for all varieties of tangelos at 2.1 million boxes is continued.
Utilization of the crop as of January 1, 2001 is 0.9 million boxes the same as last season.
If realized, this will be the least amount of tangelos recorded since the 1968-69 season.
A route survey (Row Count) was conducted on December 26-27 and indicated that usable remaining rows were available to attain the forecast.
Last season 2.2 million boxes were recorded.
Bearing trees used this season are down from last year and the average fruit per tree is almost the same.
K-EARLY CITRUS FRUIT AT 60,000 BOXES
The forecast of K-Early Citrus Fruit is held at 60,000 boxes.
As of January 1, 2001 the estimated certifications are 28,000 boxes.
Last season, when 110,000 boxes were recorded, 77,000 boxes had been certified to the same date.
Use of the remaining portion of the crop will be dependent on processing use.

FRUIT SIZE COMPARISONS BY TYPES TO PREVIOUS SEASONS
Size frequency distributions are from the December size survey conducted in sample groves during the period of December 1 through 22, 2000.
The distributions are by percent from fruit within the size range of each 4/5 bushel container.
These percents relate only to fruit from spring bloom and exclude summer bloom fruit in all seasons.
