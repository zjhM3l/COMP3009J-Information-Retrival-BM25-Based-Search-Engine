2002 Press Kit Listing Released January 2002 Thousands of Reenactors Scheduled To Re-Create Battle of Perryville FRANKFORT, Ky.
-- Each year, a confederation of Civil War re-enactors called the North-South Alliance chooses a single site to meet for its annual battle reenactment.
For 2002, Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site in central Kentucky will host this prestigious event.
Perryville is no stranger to reenactments.
In fact, this scenic park that commemorates Kentucky's most important Civil War battle hosts battle re-creation around the anniversary of the actual clash in 1862.
But everything about the 2002 event, scheduled for Oct. 4-6, will be far bigger.
Typically, up to about, 1000 participants show up for the annual Perryville battle reenactment.
But the North-South Alliance event is expected to attract up to 7000.
The number of spectators usually ranges up to 7,000.
For 2002, attendance is expected to around 20,000.
According to Kurt Holman, park manager, the sheer numbers of re-enactors will help provide the most authentic atmosphere possible for the clash of Federal and Confederate forces.
Adding to the feeling of witnessing history is the fact that the park encompasses much of the land fought over in the bloody battle of Oct. 8, 1862.
In addition to the battle re-creation itself, which will be staged both Saturday and Sunday, the event will include Civil War encampments, military drills, living history programs, and a period church service.
Admission will be $10 for adults for one day, $15 for a two-day pass.
Daily admission for children is $5 for children age 5 and above.
Shuttle service will be provided to the park.
A web site has been established for the event.
It is http://www.perryville2002.com.
