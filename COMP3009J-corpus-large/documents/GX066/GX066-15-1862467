Illicit diamond trade fuels Sierra Leone conflict, report says __________________________________________________________________

United Nations -- Acting on a report from a special panel of experts investigating the use of Sierra Leone diamonds to finance the war operation of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, the United States and Great Britain are working on a resolution that would impose mandatory worldwide sanctions on Liberia until it ceases its illicit diamonds-for-arms trafficking.
U.S. and British diplomats discussed the initiative January 25 during a Security Council meeting, which was reviewing a U.N. expert panel's report on Sierra Leone diamonds.
Acting U.S. Representative to the U.N. James Cunningham said that "controlling the flow of conflict diamonds and illicit arms is essential to end the fighting and destabilization in Sierra Leone and its neighbors.
We are intent on ending the illicit trade in arms for diamonds that has caused so much devastation and human suffering in Sierra Leone and throughout West Africa."
Cunningham said that the United States will work with council members, the U.N., countries in the region, and a delegation of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ministers who will be visiting the U.N. in the next few days to deal firmly with illegal trade and sanctions violations, and to act on the panel's recommendations.
In a written report to the council, the experts said they found "unequivocal and overwhelming evidence that Liberia has been actively supporting the RUF at all levels in providing training, weapons, and related material, logistical support, a staging ground for attacks, and a safe haven for retreat and recuperation and for public relations activities."
Liberian President Charles Taylor, they concluded, "is actively involved in fueling the violence in Sierra Leone."
The report, released in late December, was requested by the Security Council in July and prepared by a panel of five experts appointed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
The chairman of the panel was Martin Chungong Ayafor of Cameroon, and it included Ian Smillie, a diamond expert from Canada; Johan Peleman, an expert on arms and transportation from Belgium; Harjit Singh Sandhu, an Interpol expert from India; and Atabou Bodian, an International Civil Aviation Organization expert from Senegal.
Diamonds have been central to the RUF's ability to buy weapons and sustain its war against the government of Sierra Leone, the panel said in its 64-page report, which outlined the illegal diamond trade as it relates to Sierra Leone, weapons transfers, and personalities involved.
The panel found that the bulk of RUF diamonds are smuggled out of Sierra Leone through Liberia by RUF commanders and their trusted couriers.
Liberian registered aircraft are being used for arms deliveries as well, the report said.
The experts said that throughout their work, they were struck "by the widespread breaking of Security Council sanctions on both weapons and diamonds" and by the fact that the actions were done with impunity.
They recommended about 25 steps that can be taken by the Security Council, individual governments, and international organizations that would considerably tighten controls on diamonds and arms transfers in the region.
They also suggested that a complete embargo be imposed on diamonds from Liberia until Liberia demonstrates convincingly that it is no longer involved in the trafficking.
Liberia's Foreign Minister Monie Captan told the council that his country is "the target of grossly unsubstantiated allegations of diamond smuggling and gun running with the RUF."
Captan said that his government would work with the United Nations to help end the suffering of the people in Sierra Leone, and has undertaken several steps, including grounding all Liberian registered aircraft, to contribute to peace in the region.
He asked for U.N. help in securing Liberia's borders to stop the smuggling.
Cunningham said that the United States will study carefully Liberia's announcements.
"But we are concerned that these last-minute announcements in the face of imminent council action, after months of discussion, are a calculated ruse designed to divide the Security Council rather than to signal any genuine change of policy," he said.
"It is instructive that it took the possibility of sanctions to move the government of Liberia to even hortatory actions.
The steps announced thus far are unconvincing and not sufficient," Cunningham said.
British Ambassador Stewart Eldon said that the British-U.S. draft resolution being negotiated would be carried out under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, thus making it mandatory for all U.N. members.
He said the measures have been crafted to have minimal consequences for ordinary Liberians.
They include a ban on Liberian rough diamonds, a ban on flights by Liberian registered aircraft, a new arms embargo, a selective travel ban on senior Liberian officials, and a ban on the import of Liberian timber.
"We hope those present in the chamber will recognize the reasons why it is imperative that the Security Council should impose these measures as swiftly as possible," Eldon said.
"The draft resolution makes clear that the sanctions will be lifted as soon as the council sees an end to Liberian financial and military support for the RUF in Sierra Leone and for armed rebel movements in other neighboring countries."
Eldon said that Taylor must recognize "that he can no longer hide behind statements of innocence.
The quicker he realizes this and shows a commitment to the well-being of the Liberian people and regional peace, the sooner Liberia can be brought back into the international fold."
In presenting the expert panel's report to the council, Bangladesh Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, chairman of the Sierra Leone Sanctions Committee, spoke of the tragedy faced by the people of Sierra Leone and the need for the council to act on the panel's findings.
In Sierra Leone, Chowdhury said, "thousands of civilians, many of them child victims of unspeakable brutality, face an uncertain future.
Tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans have lost their lives, half a million have become refugees, and three or four times that number have been displaced.
"As we meet today, much of Sierra Leone remains in rebel hands and people there live without access to basic amenities of life, to medical assistance, to education, or to the means to a secure livelihood.
The panel and the Sanctions Committee ... remain cognizant of this vital dimension of the problem and believe that the formal presentation of the report today would spur adequate action by the Security Council in helping end the suffering of the people of Sierra Leone and this decade-long tragedy," Chowdhury said.
Sierra Leonean Ambassador Ibrahim M'Baba Kamara said that his government had studied the report carefully and found it credible.
"We maintain the view that the report constitutes a landmark discovery of the major impediments to the restoration of peace and stability in Sierra Leone," Kamara said.
"Its recommendations are far-reaching but viable."
