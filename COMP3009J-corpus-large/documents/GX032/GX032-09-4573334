Colored pen-and-ink ms., 32 x 42 cm.
Scale ca. 1:3,405,860.
In the 1680's, following La Salle's epic voyage down the Mississippi River to its mouth, France laid claim to an immense territory it named "La Louisiane".
Previous to that voyage, the area along the Gulf Coast had been considered exclusively Spanish territory under the control of New Spain.
By the early eighteenth century, France had established settlements along the Gulf Coast at Mobile, Biloxi, and New Orleans to strengthen its original claims.
This elegant and well-executed French map records the increasing French presence in that region.
It recognizes French and Spanish territory along the Gulf of Mexico from Matagorda Bay to the west coast of Florida.
A careful reading of the map allows us to speculate over the mapmaker's interpretation of political jurisdictions and boundaries, e. g., a French province of "La Floride" and a separate Spanish province of "Florida" appear.
The map includes coastline, coastal features, numerous interior streams, pictorial representation of vegetation, European and Native American settlements, and Native American nations.
Map also includes a keyed legend with the note, "Cartes Particulliers cy jouintes avoir", suggesting that individual plans for various settlements and regions on this map were made also.
Cartographer has included an elegant cartouche and a brilliant wind rose as well.
The French remained in the region until the conclusion of the French and Indian War (1756-1763), when they ceded certain territories to the Spanish and the English.
Alexandre De Batz served as an architect with French colonial authorities in Louisiana from ca. 1730 to 1760 and is responsible for at least two more plans in this survey.
His activities included work throughout the Mississippi River Valley.
He was also known for his architectural renderings of individual structures in New Orleans including the Ursuline Convent.

This Spanish map depicts a portion of the route and territory covered by the expedition undertaken by Fray Francisco Atanasio DomÃ­nguez and Fray Silvestre VÃ©lez de Escalante in 1776 through present day Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona.
Map includes missions, streams, bodies of water, Native American settlements and nations, pictorial representation of vegetation and mountain ranges.
Some names of natural features have been changed, e.g., the Sierra de Timpanogos is now known as the Uinta Mountains of Utah.
In addition, there existed some confusion as to which of the 2 lakes depicted "Lago de Timpanogos" or "Lago Salado de Tecuayo" is the current Great Salt Lake.
Map covers only the Colorado, Utah, and Arizona portion of the expedition.
Cartographer's name should not be confused with that of one of the leaders of the expedition.
A primary purpose of the expedition was to establish a road from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Monterey, California.
Expeditions such as that undertaken by DomÃ­nguez and Escalante were necessary for the protection of the northern flank of the Spanish empire in the Americas.

The initial Spanish claim to the entirety of North America, which was based on the 1493 papal bull and the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas with Portugal, came under continuous attack from various European powers, including France and England, from the second half of the sixteenth century forward.
In the sixteenth century, Spain considered Florida as a geographic entity which extended north to the Chesapeake Bay (BahÃ­a de Santa MarÃ­a) and west beyond the Mississippi River which is reflected in Arredondo's map.
His map acknowledges locations of French, English, and Spanish possessions in the region as well as those which the Spanish considered illegal possessions, most particularly that in the area of Georgia.
A colored line in the map indicates the route of Hernando de Soto's sixteenth century entrada into the Southeastern part of the United States which extends beyond the Mississippi River.
