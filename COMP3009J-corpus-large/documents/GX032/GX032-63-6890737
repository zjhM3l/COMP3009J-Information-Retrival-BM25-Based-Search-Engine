Country of Service: Armenia
Volunteer: Rich Bartell Years of Service: 1996-1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Hrazdan which is about 50 km northeast of Armenias capital, Yerevan.
While I am not sure what is being celebrated, my favorite holiday in Armenia is Vartevor.
A literal translation of Vartevor is "Rose Day".
Like Easter, the exact date of Vartevor varies from year to year, but it is always on a Sunday in the month of July.
I am told that the holiday stems from an old pagan celebration of some sort, as does the American Halloween.
And like Halloween, Vartevor is a holiday enjoyed most by children.
And, of course, by us more child-like adults.
The celebration of Vartevor involves water, and people dousing one another with it.
As I strolled through the streets of Yerevan on Vartevor, I saw hundreds of people, primarily but not exclusively children, throwing water at one another.
It came by the cup full and the bucket full.
It came out of squirt guns and in balloons.
It was administered by frontal assaults and from upper story windows.
It was directed at pedestrians, private automobiles, and public buses.
But it was always delivered with a smile.
As a foreigner (which even the smallest of children can somehow immediately discern) and as an adult unknown to the assailants, I initially proved immune to the direct assaults.
At one point a group of boys approached me tentatively, their buckets overflowing and poised for attack.
I asked them to wait and removed my camera from its protective plastic bag to take their photograph.
They were happy to comply and posed for me, grinning and with buckets ready.
After I stowed the camera I expected to be doused, but to my disappointment the children moved on without attacking.
When I reached Republic Square in the center of Yerevan, my immunity at last came to an end.
Apparently anyone willing to come that close to the large fountains with their endless supply of liquid ammunition was fair game, foreigner or not.
After the initial daring attack, the simple fact that I was already wet seemed to remove any inhibitions the children had, and for the rest of the afternoon we exchanged dousings over and over again.
It was not only fun, but proved a welcome relief from the sweltering heat of summer in Yerevan.
And I will never forget the smiles.

Country of Service: Lithuania
Volunteer: Lisa Burrowes Years of Service: 1994 - 1996 Place and Location: I was a Volunteer in Marijampole which is south west of the capital (Vilnius)--it's about a 1.5 hour drive by car and three hours by bus or train.
Lithuanians love to celebrate! And there are many days of celebration; but I think that quite possibly their favorite holiday is celebrated on June 24th every year.
It is the longest day of the year...and in Lithuania, it never really gets completely dark on this day (the sun is always low on the horizon).
The holiday is called Jonines (YO nin ness), or "John's Day".
Most people go to the forest and drink and sing and dance all night long.
There is one tradition where all the young maidens send wreaths down a creek in a race.
Whoevers wreath gets stuck on twigs or sinks or comes in last is said to be a senmerge (SAN mare gay) or spinster! Usually, there is traditional folk dancing and singing accompanying this holiday.
This holiday is different than any I've celebrated in the United States because Lithuanians love folk tradition, including the young children and teenagers.
They love to dress in their national costumes.
They are a proud people and they never forget their ancestry.
=========
Volunteer: Brian Chabowski Years of Service: 1995-1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Ukmerge which is 70 km northwest of Vilnius (the capital) and 70 km northeast of Kaunas (the second city) on the main routes north (to Tallinn and St. Petersburg, respectively).
When people attempt to make sense out of the chaos of post-Soviet societies, it is sometimes interesting and bizarre what may be found in these cultures; some holidays may have significant meaning from an era long past, while others may seem insignificant or downright repetitive in meaning.
No matter where these may be placed on the spectrum of international holidays, when individuals come in contact with new celebrations, it is natural to associate them with the ideas that they already accept as common knowledge; this was no different with one set of experiences in Lithuania.
I first introduced my students to the concept of Halloween during my first year of service; and, upon initially describing the trick-or-treating rituals, they immediately blurted out that it was most similar to their festival called Uzgavenes.
Some described the holiday as falling on the first day of spring and featured people dressing in costumes, while others said that people could be found running through the streets with bowls of cold potato pancakes, giving them to anyone who wanted to taste their quality.
To say the least, I was anxiously awaiting the coming of what would prove to be an authentic Lithuanian experience.
When Uzgavenes arrived on the calendar, I noticed it was the day before Ash Wednesday (or, Shrove Tuesday), the last day before Lent.
This time of fasting on the Catholic calendar is originally supposed to have simulated the 40 days and nights that Jesus spent wandering in the desert.
As Catholicism grew and became a staple set of ideals for a wide variety of cultures, the time before the fasting developed into a period of final celebration; some societies set aside one day, others used many days just before the start of Lent.
The main example in the New World would be Mardi Gras; be it in Louisiana or Brazil, it is a period of jubilation and has become known worldwide for its extravagance.
For what could be called the Lithuanian version of Mardi Gras, it is true that cold pancakes everywhere abound, served up by hordes of singing children.
It is even more true that some people are clever enough to include small pieces of meat in the pancakes, acting as a pun against the anti-meat doctrine to be observed during Lent and bellowing defiantly like a stand worker selling programs at a baseball game: "Hurry, hurry, hurry!!! Get your meat while it lasts!!! There's still time!!!" This boisterous behavior that children find so easy to exert is on display in this grand celebration of culture and religion.

Country of Service: Poland
Volunteer: Deirdre Cotter Years of Service: 1996-1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in south Poland in a small town by the name of Nowa Deba.
When translated into English, that means New Forest.
The closest city that people know about is Krakow.
I am three and a half hours east of this famous city.
Most of the celebrations that are celebrated here are Catholic ones.
There are other religions as well, but Poland is primarily a Catholic country.
Many Catholic holidays are deeply-rooted in Polish history.
I think that Christmas is the biggest here in Poland.
In Poland, decorations are up by December 1 and are removed by January 6.
I have spent time with my Polish friends, and I have seen the way that they celebrate this holiday.
Because of the snow and all of the lights, it is a beautiful time regardless of whether you celebrate the holiday.
In almost every city, big or small, there are little stands set up that sell Christmas decorations, food, and the Christmas carp.
Christmas dinner is the most important meal of the holiday season.
Many families have a live carp swimming in their bathtub until Christmas Eve comes.
Usually they buy it a couple of days beforehand, kill it on December 24th, and prepare it for the evening dinner.
Families get together and eat so much that people usually have to go on a diet before they are seen in public.
Before dinner people break a piece of bread with each other and wish each other well for the next year.
People either go to church on Christmas Eve or during the day.
After lunch on Christmas Day people visit each other and sometimes exchange gifts.
=========
Volunteer: Ingrid Johnson Years of Service: 1996-1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Koszalin which is located near the Baltic sea in northwestern Poland.
It is about 600 km from Warsaw (or seven hours on a fast train), and about three hours from a very large city, Gdansk.
Probably the most memorable new holiday for me was November 1, All Saints Day.
On this day everybody goes to the cemetery to clean up the graves and re-decorate them.
Then at night the entire graveyard is filled with lights from all the candles.
It is a very special and memorable holiday.
I have never seen such care and love put into a cemetery by an entire community.
Christmas was also interesting in Poland.
First the entire family gathers on December 24 for Wigilia - or Christmas Eve dinner.
Each family sets an extra place in case someone stops by.
There are also many traditional foods served on Christmas.
First you start with mushroom soup (Poles always eat soup) and herring.
Then you eat some type of cabbage salad and noodles with poppy seeds.
The main course is carp and potatoes.
On Christmas Eve people cannot eat meat or drink alcohol.
The next day, December 25, you eat meat all day and drink Vodka.
=========
Volunteer: Cindy Bestland Years of Service: Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Brodnica, a small city of 30,000 people in the north of Poland.
Situated on the Drweca River, Brodnica is a quiet place with a lot of history.
Brodnica is 186 km from Warsaw, and 168 km from Gdansk on the Baltic Sea.
Imienniny (Name Day Celebrations) will forever remind me of my time in Poland.
Every person has a name day- perhaps it is something like Saints Days in Catholic countries.
The calendar is printed with all of the Polish names next to their appropriate celebration days.
When it is Przemystau (a Polish name), then all of the Przemystaus, have a party.
Family and close friends come to their home bearing flowers, a small gift, or chocolate.
There will most certainly be a huge table-full of food and various cakes.
Everyone eats and talks and wishes the person Sto Lat (100 years) with the traditional song.
I have been invited to many Name Day celebrations and I always have a lot of fun.
Here in Poland, I am told, children usually celebrate birthdays and Name Days while adults only celebrate Name Days.
When I asked why, I was told that as you age, you dont want to be reminded that you are getting older, but everyone loves to have Name Day parties.

Country of Service: Romania
Volunteer: Michelle Profant Years of service: 1996 - 1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Tirgu Mures which is in Transylvania, one of the many regions of Romania.
The city is located almost in the center of the country, just two hours by car below Cluj, and north of the capital city Bucharest.
Birthdays in Romania are a little bit different than that of the United States.
Most people in the country celebrate Name Day.
There are hundreds of days throughout the year, and certain days are designated as a Name Day.
Many people celebrate their name day with other friends and colleagues much more so than their own birthday.
People give small gifts for people's name days.
In the United States, if you are older, friends will take you out for your birthday, and sometimes throw you a party.
Your friends will wrap gifts and give them to you, making you feel really special.
In Romania, it's all up to you.
The birthday person is in charge of organizing their own birthday party.
If you choose to go out to dinner with friends for your birthday, you pay for EVERYONE.
Don't expect the many gifts in return.
Most of the time, the birthday person will get some flowers from the person they invite!
=========
Volunteer: Tiffany Logan Years of Service: 1996 - 1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Vaslui, which is a small city and the capital of the county of Vaslui.
It has about 75,000 people and is situated on the eastern border of the country in the region of Moldova near the border with the Republic of Moldova, one hour south of Iasi by train.
In Romania, especially in the region I live in, they always seem to be celebrating one thing or another.
Each person has a birthday and a Name Day which is celebrated like a birthday.
The name day is on the day the saint with your name has his or her special day.
There is even the miscellaneous Name Day for anyone with a name that never belonged to a saint.
Basically, celebrations here consist of huge quantities of food.
You are served a four to seven course meal with at least an hour interval between each course.
You start with soups and appetizers and then you have sarmale (cabbage or grape leaves stuffed with meat and rice) and mamaliga (corn meal mush), then some sort of meat with potatoes and a salad thrown in somewhere along the way.
You almost always get a desert and all the wine you can drink to boot.
For birthdays and name days the responsibilities of the person celebrating are also a little different.
You must give candy and/or cakes to all your friends and co-workers all day.
If you don't it is considered bad manners.
You are also responsible for serving the big meal and the more extravagant the better.
I always find it strange that on their birthdays Romanians have to spend the whole day catering to others.
My friends tell me that it is an honor and a pleasure to make other people happy on their birthday and they are sad if their birthday is in summer or if it falls on a Saturday or Sunday because they don't have the opportunity to give candies to their friends.
=========
Volunteer: Jackie Smith Years of Service: 1996 - 1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer at the University Lucian Blaga of Sibiu.
Sibiu is almost the center of Romania.
It is one of the principal cities in Transylvania.
In Romania they have two days, March 1 and March 8, honoring women.
The first, Martisor Day, is a day for giving flowers and inexpensive tokens or pins to most of one's female acquaintances.
On the 8th, Women's Day, the men give all sorts of nice gifts for the special women in their life.
=========
Volunteer: Linda Tuller Years of Service: 1996 -1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Fundatia Oamenilor de Afaceri which is 225 km southwest of capital Bucharest, on the Black Sea.
Romanians here celebrate Martisor (pronounced "martzi-shore") in March.
This holiday comes from an ancient Dacian tradition, resembling a combination of our Valentine's Day and Mother's Day observations, as well as a recognition of the coming of spring.
On March 1, all males honor the females in their lives, sisters, friends, colleagues, teachers, and others by giving them a traditional trinket that is available for sale at all the street stands.
The trinket takes many forms: a sea lion, a pearl, a cat or whatever but each has a red or white string attached.
White symbolizes purity and red stands for blood, as a life-giving symbol.
Last March I was teaching a class of high school students on that day and every young man brought me a trinket.
I wore different ones on my clothes the following week, as the recognition of females continues until March 8.
This is a special day of recognition for mothers and wives.
Flowers are presented and they are taken to dinner, much like our traditional Mother's Day.
The tradition I have described is practiced in the Dobrogea area of Romania.
I understand that in the Moldova area, which is in the northwest part of the country, women recognize men with small gifts during this time.
=========
Volunteer: Molly Bogdan Years of Service: 1995 - 1997 Place and Location: I was a Volunteer in Sibiu which is 240 km north of Bucharest in the Transylvanian Alps.
Martisor (mart-see-shore) is a holiday a little like Valentines Day.
It is celebrated on the first Tuesday of March.
It is a holiday where women are honored with gifts, small trinkets that are made especially for the day.
Men are only allowed to give them to women.
A typical Martisor gift would be a flower made of plastic or string that would then be pinned on the jacket or blouse of a woman, not necessarily the women you are romantically involved with.
Any or all women receive gifts.
Women walk around on the day with anywhere from five to 10 of these little gifts pinned to them.
Another custom in Romania is that when your birthday comes, you must invite people over to your house and offer them drinks and cake.
The birthday person is the one giving the gifts.

Country of Service: Slovakia
Volunteer: Helene Dudley Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Presov which is about 50 miles from Poland, 50 miles from Ukraine and 80 miles from Hungary, in eastern Slovakia.
On the Day of the Dead (All Saints Day) and to some extent on Halloween and November 2 (All Souls Day) as well, everyone goes to the cemetery to place huge bouquets of flowers and candles on the graves of loved ones.
As I was walking towards the cemetery at dusk, from the size of the crowds, you would think the World Series was being played around the corner.
This is highly unusual for my part of Slovakia where the streets are generally quiet and people tend to stay home.
This is not a 'happening' place.
Well, on November 1, it WAS a 'happening' place.
The cemetery is one of those "New Orleans' style cemeteries that looks like a little city for the dead with its elaborate and varied tombstones.
The cemetery is on a slight hillside, so from the top, we had an awesome view of thousands of candles twinkling, bringing new life to this little village of the dead.
For those whose loved ones are buried elsewhere, there are common areas where candles are lit, so I left candles for my parents as well and really felt like I was at home here in Slovakia.
=========
Volunteer: Stacey Waterman-Hoey Years of Service: 1996-1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in the city of Nitra, which is 80 km from capital city of Bratislava, third largest city in country.
In Slovakia, many celebrations are similar to American celebrations but slightly different.
The have Easter but they call it "Great Night".
It is celebrated by families getting together and eating a lot of food.
They don't hide Easter eggs but they do eat a lot of candy.
May 1st is celebrated with May Poles and folk dancing.
Young girls hate this holiday because the boys fill buckets of water and try to pour it on the girls.
They also chase them around with big sticks trying to beat them (gently) and spray them with perfume.
They say that it is to make the girls clean, strong and healthy so they can have many children.
Many young girls stay in their bedrooms all day.
I think I would too!! Many people want to stop this tradition but the boys think it is very funny so they continue to do it, even though girls don't like it.
My favorite holiday is All Saints Day, November 1st.
They don't celebrate Halloween but they have a similar holiday in the spring.
On All Saint's Day, they decorate the cemeteries with beautiful flower arrangements and candles.
Everyone in town walks to the cemetery to see the flowers and light more candles.
The candles burn for two days and nights.
You can walk through the cemetery at night and it is full of beautiful candles.
It is really amazing to see.
It is also a little creepy but there are many other people there with you.
It's a good time to remember your old family members who have died and think about your life.
It's not really a happy holiday but it is very different from anything in America, and it is very beautiful.
=========
Volunteer: Carla Cesare Years of Service: 1995 -1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Bratislava, the capital city.
In Slovakia every day has a different "name."
Today for example, is Felix, tomorrow is Elvira.
Many of these are based on saints' days.
On name day everyone with that name receives gifts.
Name days are more important than birthdays.
At my first site (I extended) it was a very formal procedure, with some rather different customs.
First the person who is having the name day must supply the food and drinks.
Second, everyone has to act as if it is a big surprise even if everyone has a calendar with the names on it (and all Slovak calendars have the names on them).
A few days before, the secretary would collect money and run out to buy the office gift.
Chocolates, and scented soaps are a favorite, and of course flowers.
At my office the "name" person would try to sneak in a large box of kolac cakes and sweets.
This box would be "hidden."
In other words we would all try to ignore it until about 3 p.m.
At the appointed hour (supposedly unknown to the name person) all the others would line up with a very serious look on their face and one by one, like a receiving line, would wish the person well.
This too had a structure, "all the best, much love, happiness, friends, success".
Usually there would be one odd person who would try to get very flowery and poetic.
Following which everyone else oohs and aahs at how creative they were.
Then we all sit down, break out the kolac and have a drink.
I would normally bake chocolate chip cookies or brownies which they don't have here, but my colleagues loved them.
The most popular drink is a mixture of red wine and Pepsi.
Throughout the day other friends and colleagues would drop by with their best wishes and the obligatory single flower.
In Slovakia happy occasions mean you give an odd number of flowers and on sad an even number and you count by the stem not blossom.
Because I do not have a Name Day they tried to adopt the name Carolina for me, but no one ever remembered.
So they made a big deal out of my birthday.
We followed the exact same procedure except when it came to the drinks we had to sing Happy Birthday in English.
No matter how many times I tried I could not teach them the line, Happy Birthday dear......", and the room would fall silent except for my voice.
Now I live in the capital city in a large office so we do it differently.
We celebrate Name Days and birthdays every three months collectively, say a toast, have champagne and cake, and everyone gets a gift - plants seem to be a favorite.
It might also be of interest that under communism Slovaks could only be given names from a list of 1,000.
It was not possible to make up a name or use something different.
Hence, I know countless Marias, Peters, Jans, and Andreas.
I hope this helps your effort and if you like I can look up your name day for you.
=========
Volunteer: Jodie Hendrick Years of Service: 1997-1999 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Dubnica nad Vahom which is about half an hour away from Trencen.
I celebrated a Name Day.
Name days are not celebrated in the states and it was very interesting for me.
On the Slovak calendar every day has a specific name.
The day is celebrated much like a birthday.
The whole family gets together to celebrate the person's Name Day.
It is as much a celebration for the person who has the Name Day as it is for the family.
=========
Volunteer: Michelle Machalka Years of Service: 1997-1999 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Vranov nad Toplou which is in eastern Slovakia almost equidistant from three borders (Hungary is about 50km south, Poland is about 50km north, and Ukraine is about 50km east).
Vranov nad Toplou is about 450km east of the capital city, Bratislava.
The holiday that stood out most in my mind was on November 1st.
That is All Saints day in many European countries, and I believe Latin American countries also have a similar holiday called "the day of the dead".
The closest thing we have is Halloween which represents more of the scarier side of death than honoring the dead, and also Memorial day, but we don't celebrate it so much in America.
On this day, people made beautiful flower arrangements and went to cemeteries to pay respect to the dead.
The graves here are different from ones in the United States.
They are more elaborate with a large stone, often marble, cover over the length of the grave.
The marble is often decorated with crosses and ornaments engraved or attached.
At the end of the grave is a tombstone with information of the deceased and that too is decorated.
On All Saints Day, each grave was covered with flowers and decorations and candles.
I went at night with a friend to see the cemetery.
The candles were still lit despite the strong November wind.
There were about 10 candles on each grave.
It was very peaceful.
Throughout the day, families visited one another and paid respect to different friends and family that had died.
=========
Volunteer: Karilyn Dolezal Years of Service: 1996-1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Zilina.
In Slovakia they celebrate New Year's, Slovak Republic Day, Three Kings' Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Labor Day, End of WWII, St. Cyril and St. Methodius Day, Slovak National Uprising Day, Slovak Constitution Day, Assumption Day, All Saint's Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and St. Stephen's Day.
Christmas is a special time of year in both Slovakia and the United States.
Things are a bit different here than what I am used to.
The Christmas holiday officially begins on December 24th and continues to December 26th.
During these three days, absolutely everything is closed.
Only international trains and buses run on these days.
Families wait until December 24th to put up and light their trees.
This is the responsibility of the father in the family.
He sets everything up in a closed room and later calls the rest of the family to come in.
All the meals on December 24th are without meat.
The main dish is carp (People go to town to get their swimming carp from a big tank of water) along with potatoes, carp soup and of course lots and lots of sweets.
The following day, Christmas Day, the traditional Kapustnica soup is served.
This soup is similar to a cabbage soup with homemade Klobasa.
My neighbor told me that she only makes this soup once a year and only for Christmas.
These three days are solely meant to be spent with the immediate family.
It is very rare for members to receive a lot of presents...just one from each member of the family.
=========
Volunteer: Lily Loh Years of Service: 1997 -1999 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Martin which is located in the northern and central part of Slovakia.
The closest city is called Vrutky, about 10 minutes by bus.
Zilina is about 1/2 hour by car and Banska Bystrica is about 1 hour by train from Martin.
One unique celebration in Slovakia is in the spring, when the snow just started to melt and the weather turned warmer.
The young maidens are beaten with the trigs of the trees by the men in the house.
This is suppose to bring strength for the girls from the branches of the trees.
The men then poured water over the girls, to strengthen and to purify them.

Country of Service: Ukraine
Volunteer: Lora Lindsey Barabash Years of Service: 1996 -1998 Place and Location: I am a Volunteer in Sevastopol which is on the Black Sea.
Russian Navy Day is the third Saturday in July.
It is celebrated by a tremendous demonstration of power by the Russian Navy.
They reenact various wars that they have won, parade all types of ships in the bay, ignite missiles, have MiG fly-bys, and blow up a medium-size boat with a torpedo.
It is similar to the 4th of July in the USA in that there is great patriotism (to Russia) and different in that it is a huge waste of money -they use the real stuff from their stockpiles!
