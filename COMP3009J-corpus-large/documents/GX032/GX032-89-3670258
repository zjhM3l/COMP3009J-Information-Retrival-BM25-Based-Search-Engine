What began on December 1, 1941, as a civilian effort to augment Americas
defenses has become a multifunctional volunteer organization that serves
America today with the same spirit of dedication and commitment.
Since 1948,
The program, led by volunteers, is cost effective, placing the limited funds CAP receives for this effort where it will accomplish the greatest good Ã¯Â¿Â½ in the local communities.
Civil Air Patrol's Cadet Programs provides young men and women, ages 12-20, with a safe and motivating environment in which to grow and explore opportunities in the military and aviation industries.
Internal Aerospace Education The internal program is concerned with two factors: (1) the Aerospace Education portion of CAP Cadet Programs, and (2) Aerospace Education activities for the senior members of Civil Air Patrol.
Within Cadet Programs, Aerospace Education is accomplished through self-study
and instructional sessions using the textbook, Aerospace: The Flight of Discovery and through
aerospace current events reports and activities during unit meetings.
Cadets must pass comprehensive aerospace education exams as they advance through each award: Mitchell, Earhart, Eaker, and Spaatz.
For the senior membership, a voluntary self-study program is available to those individuals
who want to increase their understanding of aerospace-related activities.
This voluntary program
is the Aerospace Education Program for Senior Members (AEPSM).
The AEPSM is based on
study of the textbook, Aerospace: The Challenge, and use of the accompanying study guide.
When a senior member completes his or her study of these materials, a comprehensive
examination is administered.
Successful completion of the AEPSM earns the Brigadier General
Charles E. "Chuck" Yeager Aerospace Education Achievement Award.
Senior members with an Aerospace Education avocation can fulfill their staff and specialty
service within CAP by becoming Aerospace Education specialists.
The Aerospace Education
specialists support Cadet Programs, Senior Programs, and external programs through various
instructional means.

External Aerospace Education
CAP's Aerospace Education membership is an exclusive category for education professionals.
A professional Aerospace Education staff develops textbooks, lesson plans, and school
curriculum in support of its Aerospace Education members.
In addition, CAP hosts a number of
workshops throughout the country, as well as the National Congress on Aviation and Space
Education.
CAP is extremely proud to help our nation's schools.
Each year, thousands of free educational
products are distributed to teachers across the nation.
These products also are used to
support other educational activities such as teacher workshops, educational conventions,
conferences, air shows, and aviation days.
Teachers may order additional classroom support materials through a 48-page catalog.
Educational products can be ordered with a special discount for teachers and shipped for
delivery within 48 hours.
In addition, many of CAP's educational resources can be accessed on line at
www.capnhq.gov.
Developing and enhancing the educational skills of teachers is an ongoing and significant
portion of Civil Air Patrol's Aerospace Education program.
Each year, CAP promotes basic and
advanced graduate-level Aerospace Education workshops for hundreds of teachers.
Instructional
modules prepare teachers to use aerospace themes and techniques to teach science,
mathematics, geography, history, social science, art, literature and music.
Civil Air Patrol sponsors
field trips to historic aviation sites, aerospace research laboratories, and air and space
facilities to augment these workshops.
To complement the workshops, orientation flights are
often arranged with the U.S. Air Force.
These flights expose teachers to the challenges of
aerospace missions and help promote an understanding of the career opportunities available in
today's Air Force so they may better inform their students.
Each year, CAP hosts the National Congress on Aviation and Space Education.
The Congress
is the premier Aerospace Education event in the nation and is one of CAP's major
contributions to aviation and space progress in America.
Teachers receive information and
practical training on how to more effectively motivate their students and prepare them for an
increasingly complex world.
One of the main purposes of the Congress is to generate an appreciation and understanding
of how aviation research and space exploration have contributed to technological development
in our society.
Space is a frontier that mankind has barely pierced, and CAP believes the
continuation of America's supremacy in this arena will require the support of a well-informed
and educated citizenry.
Presented annually since 1968, this educational symposium brings together educators from
around the nation to enjoy a diversity of gifted speakers and motivational teachers.
Aerospace-oriented
hands-on/minds-on classroom activities for all grade levels are offered in a variety of
break-out sessions.
Educators enhance their careers and benefit their students by exploring the
latest tools, topics, and techniques in the field of Aerospace Education.

Emergency Services
Since 1941, Civil Air Patrol has strived to save lives and alleviate human suffering through a myriad of emergency services missions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Search and Rescue, Disaster Relief and Humanitarian Services.
CAP also carries out Counterdrug Operations and Drug Demand Reduction
programs under the auspices of its Emergency Services mission.
(return to top) Search and Rescue
Perhaps best known for its search and rescue effort, CAP flies more than 85 percent of all inland search and rescue missions in the continental United States as tasked by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center, based at Langley AFB, Va.
Civil Air Patrol volunteers are on call 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, to provide search and
rescue services to the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center, the U.S. Coast Guard, rescue
coordination centers in Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and state and local agencies.
Missions are initiated to locate missing aircraft, aid aircraft crash victims, search for missing persons, rescue people in distress, locate the source of emergency locator transmitter signals, transport blood or organs, and transport search and rescue dog teams.
Each year, CAP is credited with
saving about 100 lives.
(return to top)
Disaster Relief
Civil Air Patrol plays a vitally important role in disaster relief operations, providing air and ground transportation and an extensive communications network in times of disasters.
CAP
often works alongside other agencies in the disaster-relief business to improve responsiveness
and to minimize human suffering.
Following disasters, volunteers provide damage-assessment services for state officials, U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, National Guard, and state and county emergency management
agencies.
CAP volunteers support flood-relief operations, monitoring water levels, stream flows and flooding projections.
Ground operations include sandbagging, dike patrol, managing emergency
shelters, and staffing disaster-relief hotlines.
CAP aircrews also provide real-time, slow-scan television images of flood-ravaged areas.
The images can be transmitted directly from an aircraft to an emergency operations center, which greatly augments a center's ability to coordinate with other relief agencies.
Aircrews also
transport medical supplies to county health departments and fly medical doctors over flooded
areas so that they can assess potential health problems.
Through memorandums of understanding, CAP supports many humanitarian relief and
emergency management agencies.
These include the National Weather Service, American Red
Cross, Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Forest Service, Federal Emergency Management
Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Salvation Army.
These
agreements outline services each agency may provide to the other in times of disaster or other
humanitarian crises.
CAP is also part of the FAA's SARDA (state and regional disaster airlift)
program.
SARDA organizes private industry, government, and the general aviation community to
provide emergency evacuation of communities.

Counterdrug Operations
Civil Air Patrol provides its immense infrastructure to support the federal and state war on drugs.
CAP provides transportation, communications, reconnaissance, and eradication support
for the Department of Defense, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Customs Service, U.S.
Forest Service, and state and local law enforcement agencies.
CAP has been tasked to
provide rapid-response reconnaissance for the Southwest border.
CAP supports these efforts with more than 5,000 volunteers, who go through a security check and training by either the U.S. Customs Service and/or the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Each year, CAP interdiction
efforts assist in confiscating or eradicating billions of dollars worth of illegal drugs.
Because
highly trained volunteers provide CAP services, the agency's costs are minimal and the return
to the taxpayer is immense.

Drug Demand Reduction
In addition to its drug interdiction efforts, Civil Air Patrol is involved in an education program to encourage America's youth to remain drug free.
The program, led by volunteers, is cost effective, placing the limited funds CAP receives for this effort where it will accomplish the greatest good Ã¯Â¿Â½ in the local communities.
CAP's Drug Demand Reduction program provides alternatives to drug use through senior leadership, mentoring, training, alternative activities, and programs to prepare youth for success in life.
CAP's Drug Demand Reduction program is funded by and is in direct support of the U.S. Air Force Drug Demand Reduction initiatives.

Cadet Programs
Civil Air Patrol's Cadet Programs provides young men and women, ages 12-20, with a safe and motivating environment in which to grow and explore opportunities in the military and aviation industries.
Civil Air Patrol cadets participate in a tiered program of progression.
The
program consists of 16 achievements including the Gen Billy Mitchell, Amelia Earhart, Gen Ira
C. Eaker, and Gen Carl A. Spaatz awards.

The Military Experience
CAP's Cadet Programs has a strong impact on the youth of America, especially those with
an interest in the military and, in particular, the U.S. Air Force.
The Cadet Programs provides
the training necessary to excel in the military and the opportunity to apply it to real-life situations.
The U.S. Air Force recognizes the high standards CAP cadets must meet.
For that reason,
cadets who earn the Gen Billy Mitchell Award in the Cadet Programs are eligible to enlist in the
Air Force, Air Force Reserve or the Air National Guard in the advanced pay grade of E-3
(airman first class) instead of airman basic.
Cadets reaching this level are also entitled to
training credit when applying for entry into the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps.
Civil Air Patrol cadets who earn the Gen Carl A. Spaatz Award often receive preference
when applying for Air Force commissioning or entry into the Air Force Academy.
Each year,
approximately 10 percent of the student population at the U.S. Air Force Academy are former
CAP cadets.
These cadets experience a slightly higher graduation rate overall than other
academy cadets.
Other CAP cadets interested in a military career elect to attend the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point or the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis.
(return to top)
Special Activities
Each year, almost 8,000 cadets attend wing and regional special activities and almost 1,500
cadets attend activities at the national level.
Additional opportunities for cadets to learn to fly
are continuously pursued by CAP's National Headquarters Cadet Programs staff.
Civil Air Patrol provides more than 20,000 orientation flights to cadets during the year.
Through a series of structured flight sessions, cadets are exposed to flight and the general
aviation environment.
Cadets are offered the opportunity to fly solo in gliders and powered
aircraft.
The highlight of CAP's national activities is the International Air Cadet Exchange (IACE).
Each year, more than 100 CAP cadets visit one of 18 participating countries in Europe, Australia,
and the Pacific Rim.
At the same time, foreign cadets and escorts visit CAP wings and
squadrons throughout the United States.
The 2Ã¯Â¿Â½-week visit provides many opportunities for
participants to learn and experience the host country's customs.
Through IACE, cadets develop
an understanding of other cultures and help promote international goodwill.

Academics and Scholarships
CAP affords cadet members many opportunities to explore exciting career possibilities in the
field of aviation through special programs and academic scholarships.
CAP provides scholarships
to cadets to further their studies in areas such as engineering, science, aircraft mechanics,
and aerospace medicine, among others.
Scholarships leading to solo and private pilot flight
training are also available.
