This animal is better known as a javelina.
They are not wild pigs; they do not have large tusks and they are much smaller.
Javelinas are very social, traveling in groups of up to eighteen.
Each herd has its own scent, which comes from musk glands.
The members also keep track of each other with grunts and snorts.
You may smell or hear the javelina before you see them.
