SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Regulatory Information
We did not publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this regulation.
Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing an NPRM.
Publishing an NPRM was impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
There was insufficient time remaining to publish an NPRM after we were notified of the required closure, and further delaying the event to follow normal rulemaking procedures before incorporating this important safety measure would have a significant negative affect on the outcome of this annual, highly-attended event.
For the same reasons, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.
Background and Purpose
The East Las Olas Boulevard Drawbridge, mile 1064.0, across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, has a vertical clearance of 31 feet above mean high water and a horizontal clearance of 91 feet between fenders.
The existing operating regulations in 33 CFR 117.5 require the bridge to open promptly and fully for the passage of vessels when a request to open is given.
The East Sunrise Boulevard Drawbridge, mile 1062.6, across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, has a vertical clearance of 25 feet at mean high water and a horizontal clearance of 90 feet between fenders.
The existing operating regulations in 33 CFR 117.261(gg) require the bridge to open on signal; except that from November 15 to May 15, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., the draw need open only on the hour, quarter-hour, half-hour and three-quarter hour.
The City of Fort Lauderdale Police Department recently requested that the Coast Guard temporarily change the operating regulations for both drawbridges during parts of the 2001 Air and Sea Show to allow the considerable amounts of vehicular and pedestrian traffic be moved away from the beach as safely and quickly as possible.
These temporary changes to the drawbridges operating regulations will allow the draws of the East Sunrise Boulevard and East Las Olas Boulevard drawbridges in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to remain closed from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. to 10:45 p.m. on May 5, 2001, and from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on May 6, 2001.
Except that, the East Sunrise Boulevard drawbridge may open at 4:45 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. each day, and the East Las Olas Boulevard drawbridge may open at 4:30 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. each day on May 5 and 6, 2001.
Regulatory Evaluation
This proposal is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order.
The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under that order.
It is not ``significant'' under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT)(44 FR 11040:February 26, 1979).
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
The changes to the bridge's operating schedules will only be in effect for five total hours over a two-day period.
Further, the temporary schedules still allow for some scheduled openings, albeit at reduced intervals.
Small Entities
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities.
``Small entities'' include small business, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as the regulations will only be in effect for five total hours over a two day period and the event will be highly publicized.
Assistance for Small Entities
Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-221), we offer to assist small entities in understanding the rule so that they could better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking process.
Small entities may contact the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT for assistance in understanding and participating in this rulemaking.
We also have a point of contact for commenting on actions by employees of the Coast Guard.
Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards.
The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business.
If you wish to comment on actions by
[[Page 23162]]
employees of the Coast Guard, call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247).
Collection of Information
This rule calls for no new collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).
Federalism
We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13132 and have determined that this rule does not have implications for federalism under that order.
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) governs the issuance of Federal regulations that require unfunded mandates.
An unfunded mandate is a regulation that requires a State, local, or tribal government or the private sector to incur direct costs without the Federal Government's having first provided the funds to pay those unfunded mandate costs.
This rule will not impose an unfunded mandate.
Taking of Private Property
This rule will not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.
Civil Justice Reform
This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.
Protection of Children
We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks.
This rule is not an economically significant rule and does not concern an environmental risk to health or safety that may disproportionately affect children.
Environment
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this action and has determined under figure 2-1, paragraph 32(e) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1C, that this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
Indian Tribal Governments
This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.
