STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DON YOUNG
HEARING OF THE COMMITTEE ON RESOURCES
ON THE
UNITED STATES-PUERTO RICO POLITICAL STATUS ACT, H.R.856
MARCH 19, 1997
WASHINGTON, D.C.
It is a pleasure to welcome the witnesses here today as the Committee on Resources considers H.R.856, the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act.
Today we begin an important part of the congressional consideration of legislation to resolve Puerto Rico's political status by hearing from some of our colleagues in the House, the Governor of Puerto Rico, leaders of the three political parties of Puerto Rico, and the Clinton Administration.
Last month, the top leaders of the Puerto Rico Legislature presented copies of House Concurrent Resoultion 2, asking the Congress to authorize a political status referendum in Puerto Rico to be held before the end of 1998.
This legislation responds to the legislature's request by providing the necessary framework leading to full self-government for Puerto Rico.
I thank the witnesses from Puerto Rico for traveling to Washington to personally present their views on the legislation to the Committee.
Your views today, and others later in Puerto Rico, are a crucial part of the development of final legislation to resolve Puerto Rico's political status.
Next month the Committee will go to San Juan and Mayaguez to hear from other leaders of the people of Puerto Rico.
As we will start today's hearing with a Members panel, whose comments I know will be very helpful to the Committee, I want to mention that the Committee has received a statement regarding this legislation and Puerto Rico's political status from a former Member of this Committee, Robert J. "Bob" Lagomarsino.
Mr. Lagomarsino served on this Committee as Ranking Republican on territorial issues for a decade, dealt with insular issues for almost 20 years, and was intimately involved with Puerto Rico's political status.
In reviewing Mr. Lagomarsino's statement, one should remember that he introduced legislation in 1988 authorizing a referendum on Puerto Rico political status, and was heavily criticized by some for raising what many considered to be a very difficult issue that should be left alone.
The only hearing on Lagomarsino's Puerto Rico political status referendum legislation in the 100th Congress, was a forum in the Capitol sponsored by Senator Strom Thurmond and former Senator Spark Matsunaga.
However, Bob Lagomarsino's foresight and leadership regarding Puerto Rico's political status was affirmed the next year in 1989, when President Bush asked the Congress, in his first State-of-the-Union address, to authorize a referendum on Puerto Rico's political status.
In addition, a number of the same voices who criticized Lagomarsino's 1988 call for a referendum on Puerto Rico's political status, began in early 1989 to urge the Congress to pass a bill for a federally authorized status referendum.
However, no Puerto Rico status legislation was enacted into law during President Bush's term in office.
That was in spite of tremendous efforts by individuals like Bob Lagomarsino, who of course was in the Minority at the time, and many others on both sides of the aisle and the Capitol.
The 1989 to 1991 legislative initiatives of the House and Senate to resolve Puerto Rico's political status were unsuccessful, primarily because they did too little or required too much.
In contrast, I believe the three stage process in the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, provides a manageable and practical approach to resolving Puerto Rico's political status.
Budgetary, legal, political concerns are dealt with as necessary in the appropriate stages of the process and are consistent with past precedents of the United States in dealing with the evolution of territories to permanent forms of full self-government.
Perhaps most importantly, the legislation incorporates the principles of self-determination for the United States and Puerto Rico, as both the Congress and the people of Puerto Rico must approve of each stage in order for the political status process to advance.
In 1998 we will observe the 100th anniversary of United States administration of Puerto Rico.
During this century, the residents of Puerto Rico and the United States have enjoyed the benefits of U.S. sovereignty and nationality in Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory, including increasing levels of self-government and statutory U.S. citizenship since 1917.
However, the time has come to complete the self-determination process so that a recognized form of full self-government can be established for the islands.
The degree of local constitutional self-government established under federal law in 1952 has allowed the federal-territorial relationship to evolve, but it can't be sustained forever in the absence of an informed act of self-determination in which the options for full self-government are defined accurately.
Currently Puerto Rico remains in political, but not permanent, union with the U.S. and is governed under the territorial clause authority of Congress defined in article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution.
Surely after 100 years of U.S. sovereignty Congress also has the responsibility under the territorial clause to define the terms under which it would be willing to bring the 3.8 million U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico into the more perfect state of union enjoyed by the citizens of territories which have achieved statehood.
Similarly, Congress has a responsibility to define the basis upon which it would approve termination of Puerto Rico's territorial status in favor of separate nationhood as an independent country or a separate sovereign in free association with the United States.
Only when these options for full self-government -- as Congress is willing to consider them -- have been accurately defined can the people make an informed choice
The current process and status definitions embodied in the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, is a result of the record established during the last Congress through hearings in Washington, D.C. on October 17, 1995, and in San Juan, Puerto Rico on March 23, 1996, as well as the deliberative process of subcommittee and committee actions during the balance of 1996.
These cumulative efforts resulted in the legislation being placed on the Union Calendar at the end of the 104th Congress and the introduction of an updated United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, H.R. 4281, which served as the basis for and with text identical to that of the current H.R. 856.
The year of 1997 is the time to act, to empower the people of Puerto Rico in 1998 to choose their final political status destiny.
No more excuses and delays to the resolution of Puerto Rico's political status.
Puerto Rico has demonstrated the ability to function democratically under local constitutional self-government for 45 years.
Even more significantly, the people of Puerto Rico have overwhelmingly and loyally supported this Nation in every armed conflict with enormous personal sacrifice for nearly a century.
They have earned the right many times over to seek separate nationality and citizenship or full and guaranteed U.S. citizenship as a permanent part of the United States.
Now, we have a moral obligation to deliver, finally, to the Americans of Puerto Rico, the blessings of liberty and democracy which General Miles proclaimed to have brought upon arrival of the United States in Puerto Rico in 1898.
This can be accomplished through a federally authorized status referendum in 1998, as provided in the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, H.R. 856.
