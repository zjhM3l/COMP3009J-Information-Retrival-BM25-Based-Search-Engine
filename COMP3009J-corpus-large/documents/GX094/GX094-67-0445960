Porker Award February 18, 2000 MONEY DOWN BIG DIG RAT HOLE WINS PORKER WASHINGTON For choosing the most expensive option for getting cars across Boston Harbor, the Congress of the early 1980s has won Rep. Tom Petri's latest Porker Award.
"Back in the early 1980s I protested when the late House Speaker, Thomas P. ("Tip") O'Neill, used his political muscle to get a gold plated highway and tunnel project approved for his Boston, Massachusetts district.
I charged that the project, informally known as the "Big Dig," would be fabulously expensive, and would suck away tremendous amounts of money needed for highway projects located in every one of the 50 states," Petri said.
"Now underway," Petri continued, " Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project is, as the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority notes, the largest, most complex and technologically challenging highway project ever attempted in American history."
The project has gone through a series of scandals and budget adjustments, Petri explained.
Earlier this month, the Chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority revealed that the latest cost overruns have raised the price of the Big Dig by $1.4 billion, boosting it to a current estimated cost of $12.2 billion.
In real dollar terms, this makes the Big Dig more costly than the building of the Panama Canal and the Alaska Pipeline.
"Happily, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is helping to pay the cost of the Big Dig, but I have to believe that if Congress had looked at the real cost of the project, Boston would have been told instead to restore its current bridges over the Boston Harbor at less than 1/10th of the cost," Petri said
