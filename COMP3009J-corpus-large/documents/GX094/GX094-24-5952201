Unit 7: Contemporary America and the Future
Abstract
In this unit students learn about dramatic changes that occurred during recent decades and their impact on the future direction of our country.
First, students examine the turbulent events of 1968 and assess their impact on President Nixon's attempts to reestablish law and order and to end the war in Vietnam.
Using primary and secondary sources, students investigate the evidence uncovered during the Watergate investigation, as well as the consequences of President Nixon's actions and President Ford's subsequent pardon.
Using a constitutional framework, students compare the Watergate crisis to the Iran-Contra affair of the Reagan administration and the Lewinsky scandal of the Clinton administration.
Economic issues of the 1970's such as stagflation are explored through personal interviews and reading newspaper articles, unemployment statistics, and economic appraisals during the Ford and Carter administrations.
Students then compare "Reaganomics," evaluate the impact of different economic policies, and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of each.
Major foreign policy initiatives of recent presidents are also examined throughout the unit.
Students focus special attention on the United States' role in the Middle East, including attempts to stabilize the region, the Iranian hostage crisis, and the Persian Gulf War.
They analyze the United States' goals and objectives in the region through newspaper and magazine accounts and propose a course for the future.
Students also analyze causes for the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and its implications for the future.
The unit concludes with a look at today and the direction for our nation in the future.
Persisting controversial social issues such as abortion, affirmative action, and gay rights are explored through court cases.
The unit concludes with students selecting a technological advancement of today and hypothesizing how it will affect the future.
