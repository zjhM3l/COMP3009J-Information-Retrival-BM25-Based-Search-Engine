FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION FUND: NATIONAL WORKPLACE RESOURCE CENTER ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MODEL POLICY ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE WORKPLACE I. PURPOSE: [Employer X] is committed to promoting the health and safety of our employees.
Domestic Violence is a leading cause of injury to women in this country.
The purpose of this policy is to heighten awareness of domestic violence and to provide guidance for employees and management to address the occurrence of domestic violence and its effects in the workplace.
II.
DEFINITIONS: 1.
Domestic Violence: A pattern of coercive behavior that is used by one person to gain power and control over another which may include physical violence, threat of violence, sexual, emotional and psychological intimidation, verbal abuse, stalking, and economic control.
Domestic violence occurs between people of all racial, economic, educational, religious backgrounds, in heterosexual and same sex relationships, living together or separately, married or unmarried, in short term or long-term relationships.
Domestic violence is a major cause of injury to women, although men also may be victims of such violence.
2.
Batterer, Perpetrator, or Abuser: The individual who commits an act of domestic violence as defined above.
3.
Batterers' Intervention Programs: Programs batterers attend that are designed to eliminate violence in intimate relationships, stop other forms of abusive behavior and increase victim safety.
Inappropriate batterers' intervention programs include, but are not limited to couples, marriage, or family counseling and anger management courses.
These have proven to be ineffective in stopping domestic violence.
4.
Survivor or Victim: The individual who is the subject of an act of domestic violence.
5.
Protection From Abuse Order: Protection From Abuse (PFA) Orders are civil orders issued by the Family Court of Delaware.
A Protection From Abuse action allows a victim of domestic violence to obtain a court order against an abusive partner.
This remedy does not require police intervention but rather is an action between the parties involved in the relationship.
Persons who file for a PFA order must either be married, formerly married, living together at the time of the abusive incident or have a child in common.
It can also be granted on behalf of minor children and disabled adults.
Currently, same-sex partners and dating couples are not protected by any civil process under Delaware law.
The Protection From Abuse order provides protection to the petitioner, who files the PFA, from the respondent, who is named in the PFA.
The judge may order any or all of the following to be included within the Protection From Abuse order: a.
Prohibit contact of the respondent with the petitioner or those named in the petition b. Temporarily assign use of property including house, vehicles, and checkbooks c. Grant temporary custody of children d. Relinquishment of firearms e. Counseling or treatment The PFA is granted for a specified time up to one year.
It can be extended for an additional six months.
III.
POLICY: A. Early Intervention and Education Prevention Strategies 1.
It is the policy of [Employer X] to use early prevention strategies in order to avoid or minimize the occurrence and effects of domestic violence in the workplace.
[Employer X] will provide available support and assistance to employees who are survivors of domestic violence.
(Small employers without employee assistance plans and security departments may want to replace the 2nd sentence of this section with the following sentence.
[Employer X] will provide survivors of domestic violence a copy of the "Resources/ Referral List" prepared by the Corporate Citizen Initiative (CCI).
) This support may include confidential means for coming forward for help, resource and referral information, additional security at the workplace, work schedule adjustments or leave necessary to obtain medical, counseling, or legal assistance, and workplace relocation.
Written resource and referral information should be available in all the languages spoken by employees.
Other appropriate assistance will be provided based on individual need.
In all responses to domestic violence, [Employer X] will respect the confidentiality and autonomy of the adult survivor to direct her or his life, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
2.
[Employer X] will attempt to maintain, publish, and post in locations of high visibility, such as bulletin boards and break rooms, health/first aid offices, company phone directories, and on-line information data bases, a list of resources for survivors and perpetrators of domestic violence.

B. Leave Options for Employees who are Experiencing Threats of Violence 1.
At times an employee may need to be absent from work due to family violence, and the length of time should be determined by the individual's situation.
This time period shall be determined through collaboration with the employee, supervisor/manager, Human Resources representative, [and union representative, where the employee is represented].
2.
Employees, supervisors, and managers are encouraged to first explore whether paid options can be arranged which will help the employee cope with a family violence situation without having to take a formal unpaid leave of absence.
Depending on the circumstances, this may include: Â· Arranging flexible work hours so that the employee can handle legal matters, court appearances, housing and childcare.
Â· Consider [sick, annual, or shared leave, compensatory time, or leave without pay], especially if requests are for relatively short periods.
Employer's subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) should determine if the employee qualifies for job protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Employees treated by a health care professional for a physical or mental condition may qualify for FMLA leave.
C. Procedures for Employees with Performance Issues Related to Domestic Violence 1.
While the employer retains the right to discipline employees for cause, [Employer X] recognizes that victims of domestic violence may have performance or conduct problems such as but not limited to, chronic absenteeism or inability to concentrate as a result of the violence.
When an employee subject to discipline confides that the job performance or conduct problem is caused by domestic violence, a referral for appropriate assistance should be offered to the employee.
2.
The manager in collaboration with the employee, [Employee Assistance counselor, Human Resource representative, and union representative, where employee is represented] should allow a reasonable amount of time for the employee to obtain assistance regarding the domestic violence.
Managers should be mindful that the effects of domestic violence can be severe and may take extended periods of time to address fully.
D. Disciplinary Procedures for Employees who Commit Acts or Threats of Domestic Violence 1.

Â· There is help available.
Â· You do not deserve to be treated this way.

5.
Supervisors will make efforts to provide a nonjudgmental and supportive environment for the employee that is not dependent on the employee's decisions regarding the relationship.
