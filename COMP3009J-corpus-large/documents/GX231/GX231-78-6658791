Chestnut Blight Disease in our Forests.
The chestnut blight fungus came into this country in the late 1800's on Japanese chestnuts, and reduced our native chestnuts to understory shrubs that sprout, become infected, die, and sprout again.
I am working on a biological control for this disease, and breeding chestnuts for resistance.
Chestnuts in the 21st Century.
Chestnut breeding has been done at The Experiment Station since the 1930's, and the program is now focusing on producing timber and orchard trees with resistance to chestnut blight disease and chestnut gall wasp.

History and Current Work at the Experiment Station.
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is the Nation's first state agricultural experiment station.
The Station's first laboratory was established in Judd Hall at Wesleyan University in 1875.
Two years later, the Station moved to Yale University.
In 1882, the Station moved to six acres of land purchased from Eli Whitney, Jr. in northern New Haven.
The Station is governed by an eight member Board of Control.
The Board owns in trust a 75 acre research farm in Hamden and a 50 acre research farm and woodland in Windsor.
Past and current Station accomplishments will be highlighted.
Eastern Equine Encephalitis and Mosquitoes.
Eastern Equine Encephalitis is a rare but often fatal disease of humans, horses, and some exotic birds.
It is caused by a virus that occurs naturally in song birds and is transmitted among birds by bird-feeding mosquitoes associated with large swamps.
Species of mosquitoes that feed on birds and mammals are thought to transmit the virus from birds to humans and horses.
Although no human cases have been documented in Connecticut, this virus was prevalent in Connecticut mosquitoes in southeastern Connecticut in 1996.
The virus was less prevalent in 1997.
The history, ecology, and current research will be reviewed.
Lyme Disease and Human Babesiosis.
These two tick associated diseases are increasingly becoming prevalent in Connecticut.
Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete, and babesiosis is caused by a protozoan parasite infecting red blood cells.
The black legged tick (sometimes called the deer tick) carries and transmits both pathogens.
So long as deer and ticks remain abundant, humans will continue to be exposed to these disease-causing microbes following tick bites.
The history of the disease, disease symptoms, ecology of the pathogens, and their tick vectors will be reviewed.
West Nile Fever and Mosquitoes.
An unprecedented outbreak of encephalitis cause by West Nile virus occurred in New York City in late summer and early fall of 1999.
Fifty-nine humans became ill and seven died.
The virus was isolated from mosquitoes and birds in Connecticut.
This virus, which occurs naturally in Africa, Europe, and Asia, had never before been known in North America.
The natural history of the virus and current research will be reviewed.

Sanitation Practices to Reduce Diseases in Orchards.
The major amount of the inoculum for reintroducing disease into an orchard in the spring often resides in the orchard over the winter in fallen leaves or mummified fruit.
Sanitizing the orchard by removing these sources of overwintering inoculum can go a long way toward reducing disease levels in the orchard and reducing the need for fungicides to control disease.
The principles are illustrated with a discussion of apple scab.

This discussion will highlight several diseases of historical importance and will also cover how to recognize and manage the types of plant diseases that are commonly encountered.
Poisonous Plants.
Poisonous plants have always been part of daily life.
