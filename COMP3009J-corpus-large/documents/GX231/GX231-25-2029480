GROSS, Administrative Patent Judge.
DECISION ON APPEAL This is a decision on appeal from the examiner's final rejection of claims 1 through 7, which are all of the claims pending in this application.
Appellant's invention relates to a character input apparatus which includes a display for displaying characters and corresponding character type identifiers simultaneously.
We observe that on August 2, 2000 (paper no. 24), appellant filed a waiver of the oral hearing set for September 12, 2000.

Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521
Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed invention, and it reads as follows:
1.
A character data input apparatus comprising: for storing together codes of characters identifiers for distinguishing characters each of said identifiers corresponding to characters of the same kind;
a memory and character kind of different kinds, a plurality of said
a display for displaying together said characters and their corresponding character kind identifiers; means for inputting a hand written character: a controller responsive to said input means for outputting a character and its corresponding character kind identifier from said memory; a first area in said display for displaying one said character; and a second area in said display for displaying said character kind identifier individually associated with said one character wherein said one character may be distinguished from a character of similar appearance, but of a different kind.
The prior art of record relied upon by the examiner in rejecting the appealed claims is: Appellant's admitted prior art discussed on pages 1-2 of the specification and illustrated in Figure 21 (APA) Claims 1 through 7 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 102(a) as being anticipated by APA. 2
Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521
Reference is made to the Examiner's Answer (Paper No. 21, mailed November 15, 1995) for the examiner's complete reasoning in support of the rejection, and to appellant's Brief (Paper No. 20, filed August 16, 1995) for appellant's arguments thereagainst.
OPINION As a preliminary matter, we note that appellant indicates on page 3 of the Brief that the claims do not stand or fall together.
Appellant argues each of claims 1, 4, and 6
separately, but not the remaining dependent claims.
Therefore, we will treat the claims according to the following three groups: (1) claims 1 through 3 and 7/(1-3), (2) claims 4, 5, and 7/(4, 5), and (3) claims 6 and 7/6.
We have carefully considered the claims, the applied prior art, and the respective positions articulated by appellant and the examiner.
As a consequence of our review,
we will affirm the rejection of claims 4, 5, and 7/(4, 5) and reverse the rejection of claims 1 through 3, 6, and 7/(1-3, 6).

Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521
Claim 1 recites that plural characters and their corresponding character kind identifiers are to be displayed together.
Appellant contends (Brief, page 4) that in APA as
shown in Figure 21 "clearly characters and their corresponding identifiers are not displayed together, nor are plural identifiers displayed."
The examiner responds (Answer, page
5) that recognized characters and character kind information for the recognized characters are displayed together since the information is displayed on the same tablet display and displayed at the same time.
The conventional display system illustrated in claim [sic, Figure] 21 displays a plurality of characters and their character kind identifiers since when the user wants to view the kind information for any of the displayed characters, he simply moves the cursor to that displayed character and that character and corresponding kind information are displayed together.
We agree with the examiner that plural characters are displayed and that for any character displayed the character kind identifier can be displayed together therewith.
However,
only one identifier can be displayed at any given time.
Therefore, plural characters and the corresponding plural identifiers are not displayed together, as required by claim 1.
"It is axiomatic that anticipation of a claim under Â§ 102 4
Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521
can be found only if the prior art reference discloses every element of the claim."
In re King, 801 F.2d 1324, 1326, 231 USPQ 136, 138 (Fed.
Cir. 1986).
See also Lindemann Maschinenfabrik GMBH v. American
Hoist 
Cir. 1984).
Since APA fails to meet every limitation of
claim 1, APA does not anticipate claim 1 nor its dependents, claims 2, 3, and 7/(1-3).
Regarding claim 4, appellant's sole argument is that "identification of handwritten characters is displayed in the second areas associated with the first areas in which the characters are entered, simultaneously with data entry, without having to initiate a separate procedure, as is the case in connection with the apparatus of Fig. 21."
we first note that we find no limitation of display simultaneous with data entry recited in the claim.
Nonetheless, as the examiner explains (Answer, page 6), as each handwritten character is input and the recognized character is output in a square B, the cursor is located at the same square B.
As admitted by appellant (Specification, However,
page 2, lines 16-20), portion D displays the character kind 5
Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521
for the character located in the square B where the character cursor is positioned.
Since the cursor is located at the
square of the character being input, the character type identifier for the character being input will be displayed in portion D.
Thus, the identification of a character being
entered is displayed in the second area simultaneously with data entry.
Accordingly, we will affirm the rejection of
claim 4 and the claims grouped therewith, claims 5 and 7/(4, 5).
Claim 6 requires that each character has a first and second area and that the two areas are contiguous to each other.
The examiner asserts that "contiguous" is defined as
"nearby or adjacent" and that areas B and D in APA Figure 21 "can be reasonably characterized as nearby or adjacent."
disagree.
We
First, in Figure 21 there is not a separate second All of
area for displaying the identifier for each character.
the characters share a single area of identifiers.
APA fails to meet the first portion of the claim.
Therefore, Further,
even taking the examiner's definition of "contiguous," we do not find areas B and D in Figure 21 to be contiguous.
Area D
is adjacent to the last four characters, but not to each 6
Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521
character.
Accordingly, we cannot sustain the anticipation
rejection of claim 6.
CONCLUSION The decision of the examiner rejecting claims 1 through 7 under 35 U.S.C. Â§ 102 is affirmed as to claims 4, 5, and 7/(4, 5) and reversed as to claims 1 through 3, 6, and 7/(1-3, 6).
No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR Â§ 1.136(a).
