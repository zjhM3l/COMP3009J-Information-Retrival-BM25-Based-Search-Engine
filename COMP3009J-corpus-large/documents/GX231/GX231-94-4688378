Description and Care of Flag 1.01 The Maryland flag was adopted as the State flag by an act of the General Assembly in 1904 (State Government Article, Ã¯Â¿Â½13-201).
1.02
The Maryland flag is divided into four quarters.
The first and fourth quarters consist of six vertical bars alternately yellow (representing gold) and black with a diagonal band on which the colors are reversed.
The yellow and black quarters represent the family arms of the first proprietor of Maryland, George Calvert, first Lord Baltimore.
The second and third quarters consist of a quartered field of red and white (representing silver) bearing a Greek cross with arms terminating in trefoils.
The colors in the second and third quarters alternate, with red on the white ground and white on the red.
The red and white quarters display the arms of Lord Baltimore's maternal family, the Crosslands.
1.03 The diagonal band in each Calvert quadrant of the Maryland flag should be centered at the corners.
1.04 The red and yellow colors in the Maryland flag should conform to the following Pantone Marking System colors: * red on coated stock-PMS 201 * red on uncoated stock-PMS 193 * yellow on coated stock-PMS 124 * yellow on uncoated stock-PMS 124
1.05 The Maryland flag should be folded and stored in a way to preserve it from damage.
1.06
When the condition of the Maryland flag is such that it is no longer fit for display, it should be disposed of in the same manner as the U.S. flag, preferably by burning, and with the same dignity as is accorded the Disposal of the U.S. flag.
1.07
The Maryland flag in its present form was not flown until after the Civil War.
When a Maryland banner is desired for pageants, reenactments, commemorations, and other historical occasions, it may consist of the yellow and black Calvert colors displayed as in the first quarter of the Maryland flag.
Two pennants, one black and the other yellow, flown on separate staffs may also be appropriately used for historical commemorations and events.

Use During Period of Mourning 5.01 The Maryland flag should be flown at half-staff whenever the U.S. flag is so flown.
Half-staff means lowering the flag to one-half the distance between the top and the bottom of the staff.

Before being lowered for the day, the Maryland flag should again be raised to the peak 5.02 When the U.S. flag and the Maryland flag are flown together at half staff, whether from adjacent staffs or from a single staff with two halyards, the U.S. flag is raised first and lowered last.
When flown from a single staff with one halyard, the Maryland flag is secured to the halyard immediately below the U.S. flag and accompanies it as the U.S. flag is raised to the peak and lowered to half staff.
(Figs. a and b) [Figure 6] 5.03
By order of the Governor or his authorized representative, the Maryland flag shall be flown at half- staff upon the death of present or former government officials or state and national leaders, and on other occasions as the Governor or his authorized representative directs.

The Maryland flag may be used to cover the coffin of a state police officer killed in the line of duty, or any other state official or public servant whose career was substantially devoted to public service in the state.
When the Maryland flag is used to cover a casket, it should be placed so that the first quarter is at the head and over the left shoulder.
The Maryland flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground.

Use of the U.S. Ensign and Maryland Flag on Recreational Boats Note: This section does not cover the use of yacht club burgees, owner's private signals, U.S. Power Squadron flags, U.S.C.G.
Auxiliary flags, foreign flags, or social and courtesy flags.
Rules for these are well established and may be found in existing literature.
The U.S. Ensign with a canton of 50 stars (as the U.S. flag is called while in nautical use) and the U.S. Yacht Ensign, with a canton of 13 stars, are interchangeable on all types of recreational vessels while in national waters.
Because the preferred location for the U.S. Power Squadron flag is also the starboard spreader, it may be flown beneath the Maryland flag.
6.01
The U.S. Ensign and the Maryland flag are normally flown from sunrise to sunset.
However, at most yacht clubs "colors are made" at 0800.
This timing is proper when in the company of other boats simultaneously making colors.
The U.S. Ensign is flown first and lowered last.
6.02 If the Maryland flag is flown on sailing vessels: * Sloops, cutters, and schooners + While underway - sailing vessels with one mast should fly the U.S. Ensign at the stern staff, or two-thirds of the way up the leech of the mainsail (or at the top of the leech, if gaff-rigged).
The Maryland flag should fly at the starboard spreader, or on the forward mast of a schooner.
+ While at anchor - The U.S. Ensign should fly from the stern staff and the Maryland flag from the starboard spreader
Yawls and ketches * While underway - The U.S. Ensign should fly at the stern staff or at a position two-thirds up the leech of the mizzen sail (or at the peak of the leech of the mizzen sail, if gaff-rigged).
The Maryland flag should fly at the starboard spreader ("at the starboard spreader" means the spreader on the most forward mast if more than one and from the most outboard hoist of that spreader).
* While at anchor - The U.S. Ensign should fly from the stern staff and the Maryland flag from the starboard spreader.
6.03 If the Maryland flag is flown on motorboats: * While underway and at anchor - The U.S. Ensign should fly from the stern staff and the Maryland flag may be flown from the forestaff in lieu of a yacht club burgee.
