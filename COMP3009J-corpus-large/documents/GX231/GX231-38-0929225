NORTHWESTERN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS PUBLIC INPUT REPORT August 17, 2000 Prepared by U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution 110 South Church Avenue, Suite 3350 Tucson, AZ 85701 Acknowledgements Conducting a meaningful public input and visioning process within the short timeframe established by the President has been a tremendously challenging task one that has required enormous collective effort and commitment on the part of many individuals, the sponsoring state and federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, and members of the public.
Yet, the end result has been a powerful demonstration of the public's intense interest and passionate concern for the future of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
Clearly, a great deal of wisdom permeates the combined assemblage of the public's expressed opinions and submitted comments.
The U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution would like to acknowledge and thank all the members of the public who chose to participate in this public input process, including those who have expressed their skepticism about the process.
Public officials need to hear from every perspective in order to determine how best to address the needs and concerns of all citizens while working together to chart a prudent course for our shared future.
The responsibility now lies with the Secretaries to incorporate the public's collective wisdom into their recommendation to the President.
The U.S. Institute would especially like to thank the staffs of the sponsoring agencies the State of Hawaii's Department of Lands and Natural Resources, the Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council, and the Departments of the Interior and Commerce who, through this public input process, have demonstrated their shared commitment to work together to ensure the long-term protection of the remarkable qualities and resources of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
In addition, the U.S. Institute would like to acknowledge with great appreciation, the skillful efforts of our private sector facilitation partners on this project, based in Hawaii and in Washington, DC, as well as the immense efforts expended by the U.S. Institute's support staff to complete this report within such a short timeframe.

See www.ecr.gov/nwhi Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Executive Summary Introduction On May 26, 2000 the President announced his intention to provide "strong and lasting protection for the coral reef ecosystem of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands."
He directed the Secretaries of the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, working cooperatively with the State of Hawaii and consulting with the Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council, to develop recommendations within 90 days for a new, coordinated management regime to increase protection of the ecosystem and provide for sustainable use.
The Departments were also directed to conduct "visioning" sessions, which would provide opportunities for public hearing and comment to help shape the final recommendations.
Due to the interagency and intergovernmental aspect of the President's directive, the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, as a neutral and independent entity, was asked by the sponsoring agencies to impartially facilitate and document the public visioning sessions, to receive submitted public comments, and to issue an independent report of the public input process and results.
To this end, the U.S. Institute facilitated seven public visioning sessions one in Washington, DC on July 21st and six in Hawaii between July 24th and August 1st on five of the eight main Hawaiian Islands.
In addition, during the 21-day public comment period, which began on July 12th and concluded on August 2nd, the US Institute received over 1000 written comments.
This is a summary of the comments received during the visioning sessions and the public comment period.
Public Visioning Sessions A total of 432 people attended the seven public visioning sessions.
Forty-five attended the Washington, DC meeting and 387 attended the six meetings in Hawaii.
The meeting on Oahu drew the most participants, with 134 people attending.
The public vision sessions accomplished three main objectives.
They communicated the intent of the President's directive regarding the coral reef ecosystems of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands; they provided excellent opportunities for public participation, dialog, discussion, and interaction; and they produced a substantial amount of information for the Secretaries of Interior and Commerce to use in making their recommendation to the President.
The visioning session process utilizing a facilitated small group discussion format was generally, but not entirely, well-received.
The public appeared to genuinely appreciate the opportunity to meet on this rarely discussed subject and they welcomed the large amount of information made available by the four sponsoring agencies.
People seemed to also appreciate the concerted effort made by the four agencies at finding common purpose despite their obvious differences in mission and jurisdiction.
1 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Nonetheless, some participants would have preferred a more traditional public hearing format where the attendees are provided the opportunity to present formal testimony to a panel of agency officials.
Others voiced complaints that certain governmental and non-governmental organizations may have been working behind the scenes to orchestrate and script the comments of their constituents or friends.
In several instances, especially at the first meeting on Oahu and at the Kauai meeting, agency staff representatives and interns attending the meetings appeared not to have understood their principal role as listeners and occasionally jumped into the small group discussions that were primarily intended as a chance for the public to air their views.
None of these problems proved significantly detrimental to the process, however.
The hundreds of people who attended the visioning sessions were keenly interested in the topic, strong in their points of view, and civil when confronted with others who disagreed.
Public Comment Process The request for public comments was announced in the Federal Register on July 12, 2000, as well as shortly thereafter through notices in newspapers published on each of the main Hawaiian Islands.
Many organizations quickly disseminated the announcement of the request for comments through electronic and personal communication networks.
The U.S. Institute also established a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands web site to facilitate the submission of public comments.
Approximately 1090 separate comments were received during the 21-day public comment period.
The large number of comments submitted in such a short time clearly indicates a significant public interest in the future of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, especially among Hawaii residents.
Although individuals from throughout the United States submitted comments, including several from other countries, over 70% of the comments came from people who identified themselves as residents of Hawaii.
It's quite possible that the percentage of comments submitted by Hawaii residents was actually more than 85% of the total, however, since many of the people who submitted comments via email did not provide their address, although they used Hawaii-based Internet providers.
Private individuals submitted over 95% of the comments received.
Official organizational comments were submitted by approximately 24 non-governmental organizations.
Three government agencies submitted comments.
More than 60% of the public comments were submitted to the U.S. Institute by fax; approximately 25% by email; approximately 7% by mail; about 4% were submitted via the web site; and just less than 2%of the written comments were submitted at the various public meetings using the comment forms provided.
Many people chose to submit their comments through multiple means to ensure they were received, requiring a painstaking process to identify duplicate submissions.
Another significant challenge was in deciphering handwritten comments and signatures.
A highly conscientious effort was made to accurately document and report all the comments that were received.
Absolute accuracy, however, was simply not possible in the time available.
All the submitted written comments have been converted into an electronic format to facilitate dissemination of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report quickly to the public via the Internet.
2 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report The submitted comments included viewpoints expressed in short one-sentence statements, as well as in more extensive documents containing very detailed comments and recommendations.
A number of submitted comments were deeply personal and several were notably eloquent in describing their vision for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
Many people explicitly expressed their appreciation for being given the opportunity to provide their comments for consideration by the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce in making their recommendation to the President.
Similar, and in many cases identical, comments were received from different individuals, reflecting the efforts of several organizations to orchestrate comments from their constituencies by providing sample letters, suggested statements, or key points to make.
Virtually identical "cut and pasted" comments were common, as were pre-printed comment forms that individuals signed and submitted by fax.
More than one-third of all the comments received specifically referenced support for a single extensive detailed document, Malama I Ka Moana O Ka Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Caring for the Ocean of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands).
All the organizations and individuals who submitted comments are listed alphabetically in Appendix E of this report.
By clicking on a name, in the electronic version of this report, a hyperlink takes the reader to the full text of the individual or organization's submitted comment, which are catalogued alphabetically in Appendix F of the report.
Individuals submitting identical comments or referencing support for a specific document are listed together alphabetically under that comment or document to minimize repetitious printing of identical statements.
The few comments that were received after the close of the August 2nd comment period are included in Appendix G of the hardcopy versions of the Public Input Report provided to the sponsoring agencies.
These late comments are not included in the Internet version of the report, however, because production deadlines had already passed by the time these comments were received.
Major Themes A number of consistent themes emerged from the discussions during the different public visioning sessions and from the submitted comments.
A. High Value Islands and Coral Reef Ecosystems Regardless of point of view or background, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) and their coral reef ecosystems are universally held in high regard by the people of Hawaii, by Federal and State agencies, by those who use or transit Hawaiian waters, and by the public at large.
However, they are prized for different and sometimes conflicting reasons.
1.
Biological Values.
The NWHI are recognized as unique, pristine, and biologically diverse.
The islands represent intact and high functioning ecosystems that are home to an array of different terrestrial and aquatic animals and plants.
The corals themselves are unique and remain largely undisturbed.
Many of the animals and plants that inhabit the area are rare, threatened, or endangered.
There also are interrelationships between the 3 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report NWHI and the main Hawaiian Islands.
Many believe the NWHI are both a nursery for many different kinds of juvenile animals as well as a larval recruitment area for the main Hawaiian Islands.
Because humans have had a comparatively small presence, the waters remain rich in sea life and bird life.
2.
Cultural Values.
The people of Hawaii, particularly Native Hawaiians, feel a powerful kinship with the NWHI, which were the mythological, and possibly the physical, stepping stones of Hawaiian settlement.
The NWHI were, and still are, used by Native Hawaiians.
Native Hawaiians feel a powerful spiritual relationship with these islands.
Many strongly believe they have special needs and rights that include customary and subsistence gathering of animals and plants, access to ancestral sites of worship, and the opportunity to pass on their culture to the next generation by educating their children about traditional beliefs, skills, and practices.
More recently, the NWHI are also home to important historic battle and staging sites from World War II.
The memory of that war and America's role in it remains fresh for many people, including those who were born years later.
3.
Wilderness Values.
The lack of human inhabitants and remoteness of the NWHI provide some people with a highly valued sense of awe and satisfaction in knowing that wild places still exist where primordial natural processes and forces continue unimpaired by human influences.
Such wilderness areas, whether experienced directly or through the imagination, serve as a spiritual touchstone for some by enabling them to feel reconnected with their innate sense of the divine source of creation.
4.
Commercial and Economic Values.
Some of the waters of the NWHI are regularly fished by a limited number of permit holders who live primarily on Oahu and Kauai, as well as the other main islands.
Bottom fishing and lobster fishing are permitted uses in some areas and at certain times of the year.
Both fisheries are strictly regulated.
Both fishermen and seafood consumers, in Hawaii and elsewhere, depend on the NWHI islands for their livelihood.
In the past, some mining activities took place on some of the islands.
5.
Scientific Values.
Because the coral reef ecosystems of the NWHI are remote, undisturbed, and relatively pristine, they are an important location for scientific study and source of knowledge about natural systems and certain rare organisms.
Scientists from several different disciplines and institutions in Hawaii and elsewhere regularly conduct research and monitoring activities there.
In the eyes of some, the NWHI serve as an important and unique control site for monitoring and assessing both natural and humaninduced environmental changes into the future.
6.
Educational Values.
The NWHI have high educational value.
Because they represent some of world's last remaining intact coral reef ecosystems, they are excellent outdoor classrooms for people interested in learning about islands, ecology, and biogeography.
Some educational tours take place now and the islands are perceived to be an excellent "hands on" educational resource for the future.
4 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report 7.
Recreational Values.
Closely related to educational values are recreational uses.
The islands are visited by sport fishers, by divers, and by tourists.
Because the islands are remote and pristine, people are attracted to them and want to see the natural and cultural resources first hand.
Recreation and tourism also has commercial values that may also be linked to conservation if the revenues generated are used to underwrite preservation and management efforts.
B. Fears, Threats, Problems, and Perils With a few important exceptions, the public worries about the current and future health of the NWHI coral reef ecosystems.
They perceive a variety of actual and potential problems though some of these perceptions conflict with each other.
The threats fall into a number of interrelated and sometimes overlapping categories.
1.
At-Risk Species.
A number of animals and plants the Hawaiian monk seal, the green sea turtle, the golden albatross, and the Laysan duck, to name just a few are rare, threatened, or listed as endangered.
While the threats to these species come from a variety of sources, these animals and plants are at the center of various current and future legal battles and may inevitably be the political focal point for decision makers.
2.
Human Intrusions and Abuses.
Most of the threats that appear uppermost on the minds of the public derive from human activity.
Perceived current threats include marine debris (much of which washes in from other parts of the Pacific and may derive from foreign fleets); over harvesting of certain fish species by both domestic and foreign fishers; the tropical aquarium fish trade; the live reef fish trade for Asian restaurants and markets; shipwrecks, groundings, and poor anchoring which can cause direct damage to coral reefs; eco-tourism which encourages potentially harmful interactions with wildlife; tourism-related infrastructure development; pollutants and contaminants, both from increased air and vessel traffic as well as from deteriorating WWII structures; military testing; storage or use of hazardous materials; construction and dredging; and the mining of corals, sands, or undersea minerals.
3.
Future Intrusions and Abuses.
On the horizon, and in addition to a continuation or extension of the above, many worry about unbridled bio-prospecting by pharmaceutical companies and corporate researchers; the potential impacts from large-scale cruise boats; poaching and the pressures that will be created to fish the NWHI as other once productive areas decline; the use of sophisticated new technologies such as re-breathing devices and robotic submersibles that increase the time people can spend underwater; the potential storage of atmospheric CO2 underwater; deep sea dumping; the use of marine testing devices which have unknown sonic effects; and even potential wars that could be fought over or within the NWHI. 4.
Atmospheric and Oceanic Changes.
Large scale and difficult-to-substantiate changes in the ocean and air are also feared.
Global warming, sea level rise, changes in the ozone layer, island subsidence, and large and destructive storms are all threats that may be 5 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report difficult to prevent but that, nonetheless, potentially endanger the NWHI coral reef ecosystems.
5.
Invasive Species.
The NWHI has a history of intentional and accidental species introductions, including rats and rabbits.
Increased human activity (the emptying of ship ballast chambers, for example) may bring new and potentially disruptive pests to the NWHI. 6.
Research as a Threat and a Benefit.
While science, research, and monitoring are usually thought of as positive activities that produce socially useful information, invasive or extractive scientific activities are sometimes perceived to be potential threats to specific species or to the coral reefs themselves.
Conversely, many believe the lack of reliable data, especially baseline data, constitutes a threat since no one can clearly define what is being lost or gained through different management regimes.
7.
Process Failures.
The 90-day period to develop a coordinated management regime puts extraordinary pressures on all concerned.
Many believe that this short timeframe creates a significant obstacle to involving the public in an informed and deliberative consultation process.
There is a fear that under such conditions, decisions of the magnitude being contemplated by the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce will likely result in a flawed recommendation.
C. Planning, Coordination, Enforcement, and Funding Many believe that the roles and relationships among the four sponsoring entities the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Hawaii Department of Lands and Natural Resources, and the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council along with other agencies such as the US Coast Guard, the armed services, and other congressional and executive bodies, needs much more attention.
Above and beyond the physical threats mentioned above, the lack of dollars for enforcement, lack of management coordination by trust agencies and policy makers, and the persistent inability to achieve interagency cooperation are all viewed as serious threats to the NWHI.
While a few people argue that government action is not needed, most perceive the conflicting or confused jurisdictions of the state and federal agencies to be a threat in itself.
Many believe the fact that there are no clearly defined jurisdictional boundaries means that there are also no clear buffers between incompatible uses and activities.
The confusion of agencies and jurisdictions fosters an ineffective and expensive quilt work or rules, regulations, and loopholes.
Some perceive the current policymaking and management of NWHI fisheries to be ineffectual, out-ofcontrol, or captured by commercial fishing interests.
Conversely, some fishing interests consider the need for any additional regulation to be scientifically unsubstantiated, burdensome, and expensive.
Adding further jurisdictional complexity are the traditional and customary rights of Native Hawaiians and the potential status and authority of a more sovereign Hawaiian nation.
The public believes that these, and other related jurisdictional questions, need serious attention and resolution.
6 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Finding Common Ground: Ideas to Consider A. Potential Traction Points Identified by the Public Not unexpectedly, the meetings held in Washington, DC and on Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, Kauai, and Molokai, as well as the voluminous public comments that were submitted, brought out a variety of different viewpoints.
While opinions expressed and comments submitted are not always neatly consistent, at least five distinct clusters of interests and related visions for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands emerged during the public input process.
One focuses primarily on environmental preservation and protection.
A second focuses on the continuation of commercial fishing on a sustainable basis.
A third focuses on the long-term survival of the Native Hawaiian culture.
A fourth centers on promoting opportunities for research and education.
The fifth centers on the idea of promoting the NWHI as a global model for enlightened management of a healthy and sustainable coral reef ecosystem.
Without attempting to minimize the important and sometimes significant differences of opinion that were voiced during the public input process, it is useful to note where the potential common ground may lie between all these perspectives.
This question, in fact, was posed directly to those attending some of the meetings in Hawaii.
The facilitators explicitly asked participants at the Maui, Kona, Hilo, Kauai, and Molokai meetings the following question: "Knowing that some of you favor increased protection while others favor cultural, economic, scientific uses, or mixed uses, where do you believe the common ground exists among you?" Here is where some participants believe that common ground could be forged: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ People from all perspectives share a strong sense of kinship and affinity toward the NWHI.
Everyone wants to maintain a healthy, diverse, and vibrant coral reef ecosystem.
Everyone recognizes the need for on-going protection and wise management of the resources.
Everyone recognizes the public's dependence on sustainable fisheries.
Everyone wants to ensure the legacy of these coral reefs to future generations and in perpetuity.
Everyone agrees that more funding, improved interagency cooperation, and better enforcement of existing regulations is needed.
Everyone recognizes that we must learn from, and not repeat, the mistakes of poor past management practices in the main Hawaiian Islands.
Everyone believes that new partnerships will be one of the keys to future success.
7 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ No one believes that access and use of the NWHI resources should be unfettered.
Everyone believes that all activities and uses must be limited and carefully regulated.
Everyone believes that the health of coral reefs across the whole Hawaiian chain, including the main Hawaiian Islands, should be protected and that the entire archipelago should be looked at systemically.
Most people would probably agree that there should be some provision for limited access by Native Hawaiians for cultural and subsistence purposes.
Most people would probably agree that there must be carefully constructed limits for bottom and lobster fishing.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ B. Possibilities for More Cooperative Governance.
In addition to the traditional approach of designating a specific agency to take the lead, many meeting participants and commenters recognized in the President's initiative opportunities for creating new forms and/or forums of cooperative management and governance in the NWHI.
The following are some of possibilities and observations mentioned for consideration by the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Multiple jurisdictions will likely continue in some manner in the NWHI.
Comprehensive and integrated ecosystem management of the entire area will most likely require an overall governance framework of shared authority.
Successful implementation of such a coordinated management regime will only be possible through improved cooperation and increased collaboration among the agencies sharing legal jurisdiction over different but intimately related aspects of the area.
The four sponsoring agencies, plus others, and their staff must make a concerted effort and commitment to enhance their communication, to foster more effective working relationships, and to develop their ability to resolve differences more productively.
Unproductive interagency conflict will likely continue until and unless jurisdictional boundaries and authorities of the agencies involved are more clearly defined and legally resolved.
Given the challenges posed by the area's remoteness, management actions will always be costly.
Limited management resources must be shared and coordinated effectively to maximize their collective benefit.
Additional research is needed to assess the current conditions of the NWHI coral reef ecosystem, to understand its complex interactions, and to evaluate the effectiveness of management actions.
Distrust and disagreements regarding the conclusions of research studies conducted by different agencies, require jointly developed scientific protocols and implementation of an interagency research agenda.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 8 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Ã¯Â¿Â½ A system to facilitate the sharing and exchange of information needs to be developed.
Jointly allocated funding for research will enhance the incentives for interagency collaboration.
Marine debris is a significant threat that is universally acknowledged by the agencies and the public.
The existing partnership effort to address marine debris is an excellent example of interagency cooperation to accomplish shared goals.
Limited funding, however, has also limited its success.
Enhancing this collaborative effort through additional jointly allocated funding can help promote the kind of interagency working relationships needed to effectively partner in addressing other shared issues.
The acknowledged local, national, and international value of the NWHI requires a diversely composed interagency organizing and decision-making entity.
A commission or authority of national prominence with significant participation by the State of Hawaii, the Hawaiian community, and non-governmental organizations, may help further the kinds of protections for the NWHI that most of the public seems to seek.

Participants in the discussions primarily consisted of representatives of the non-governmental organizations in attendance.
10 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Qualities to be Protected: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Many participants focused on a desire to preserve the animals, communities, habitats, and biodiversity of the NWHI coral reef ecosystem.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Many participants emphasized taking advantage of the opportunity before it is lost to protect and learn from a large, relatively pristine, and intact coral reef ecosystem.
Some emphasized the area's importance as a spawning ground for commercial fish species.
Current and Future Threats: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Many participants identified over-fishing and the impacts of different types of fishing as both a current and potential future threat.
Some disagreed with this assessment, however.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Many identified inadequate planning, poor management, inadequate funding, poor implementation and accountability, and lack of enforcement as current and future threats.
Others considered excessive federal regulations without scientific justification to also be a threat.
There appeared to be broad agreement that marine debris is a significant threat to the NWHI coral reef ecosystem.
Some considered the cumulative effects from multiple stressors to be a current and future threat.
Some considered a single species approach to management as a threat to the coral reef ecosystem.
Some considered increased recreational use to be a future threat to the area.
Some felt that global warming and sea level rise pose an important future threat to the NWHI coral reef ecosystem.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Appropriate and Inappropriate Activities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some felt that fisheries and recreational activities that are sustainable and do not degrade the ecosystem are appropriate in the NWHI.
At the same time, many agreed that whether an activity is or is not appropriate would be highly dependent on where that activity took place, and the level of the activity.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some considered the most appropriate use of the NWHI to be for research and monitoring and as a protected storage bank of biodiversity.
Some felt that any form of commercial development of the area would be inappropriate.
There appeared to be strong agreement that activities that degrade the environment are inappropriate in the NWHI. 11 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Potential Management Tools, Actions, and Approaches: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A number of participants suggested the use of a zoning system where different activities or levels of activities would or would not be allowed.
Some suggested that a significant portion of the area should be zoned as a no-take ecological reserve.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some emphasized using a precautionary ecosystem approach to management of the area.
Some suggested also utilizing available international mechanisms for marine protection.
Some participants suggested that the adequacy of existing regulations and management in protecting the area and its resources was not clear.
Others felt that the Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Council's Coral Reef Ecosystem Fisheries Management Plan would provide adequate protection.
Some urged the consideration of additional management regimes, such as designation as a National Monument or as a National Marine Sanctuary, depending on how the jurisdictional issues between the various agencies are resolved.
Others emphasized reinforcing the authority of the existing Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and clarifying its jurisdiction over fisheries within its boundaries.
Mandatory vessel monitoring was suggested as a useful management tool.
Some emphasized the need for a cooperative management approach across state, federal, and international bodies that would involve multilateral agreements, while avoiding undermining of existing agency authorities and jurisdictions.
Some suggested the establishment of a permanent advisory body to provide broad-based public input for management of the area.
One person suggested that this body should be more than advisory and instead have decision-making authority.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Visions For the Future: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some emphasized the opportunity to create an international model of how to properly manage a marine protected area.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some had a vision of a fully restored marine wilderness in and around NWHI for our future children's children.
Some saw multiple and sustainable uses of the NWHI.
Some envisioned adequate funding for a coral reef research center at Midway.

Some showed up wishing to present formal testimony but were agreeable to submitting it once they understood the format.
As in the Washington, DC meeting, representatives from the sponsoring agencies were asked to observe and listen to the public's discussion.
At this and some subsequent meetings, one 13 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report or two staff members who came late or were new to the process may not have understood these directions and thus participated, but in no way dominated the conversations.
Qualities to be Protected: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Participants expressed a nearly universal appreciation for the remote, undisturbed, and pristine nature of the NWHI's coral reef ecosystems.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Nearly everyone perceives the area to be biologically, culturally, economically, and archeologically unique.
Many people commented on its unique biological and ecological values as a home for many endemic species, a habitat for some threatened and endangered species, and a nursery and recruitment source for animals and plants found across the entire archipelago.
Many participants commented on the cultural and historic connections of Native Hawaiians to certain islands, sites, traditional activities, and species that have been traditionally gathered.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Current and Future Threats: Ã¯Â¿Â½ While different people fear different kinds of threats, nearly everyone identified excessive human intrusions from fishermen, transiting ships, tourists, scientists, and the military as a problem.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Participants universally regard marine pollution (nets, line, floats) as a danger to birds, turtles, fish, and coral heads.
Farther out on the time horizon, people fear the advent of specific new threats like bioprospecting, piracy and poaching and the increased pressures on the area's fishery resources that would likely result from declining fisheries and food stocks elsewhere.
Many regard the current lack of sufficient and coordinated regulation by government, along with the failure to adequately fund current enforcement efforts, as the most important threats.
Some believe that climate change, sea level rise, and global warming threaten the existence of the coral reef ecosystems in the NWHI.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Appropriate and Inappropriate Activities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some people argued that no commercial or recreational fishing, tourism or eco-tourism, or scientific research should be done.
The coral reef ecosystems should simply be left alone.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some people argued that excessive limits on fishing were not necessary because the area is already well managed.
14 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some argued that the area should be used exclusively by Native Hawaiians.
Some argued that all military and space-related activities should be stopped.
Generally speaking, many participants believe that the NWHI coral reef ecosystems can accommodate a variety of cultural and economic uses, provided that such activities are carefully limited, very well regulated, and clearly enforced.
Potential Government Actions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Most individuals expressed a desire to create clear limits on human uses, including fishing, tourism, and research.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some argued that specific no-take and no-use areas should be established and that vessel monitoring systems should be utilized to enforce these designations.
Some argued specifically that the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council Coral Reef Ecosystem Fisheries Management plan should be used as a guide.
Others argued specifically against Western Pacific Regional Fishery Council's plan and that a "use-oriented" agency should not be placed in charge of Coral Reef Ecosystem Protection.
Many people believe that a multi-agency and multi-organization council should establish long-term goals, controls, and oversight.
Several people argued that federal agencies should not be placed in charge of the NWHI and that responsibility should be returned to the Hawaiian people.
Some people suggested that the NWHI coral reef ecosystems should be designated as a World Heritage Site.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Visions for the Future: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A healthy, diverse, and sustained ecosystem.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Sustainable utilization of the resources.
A preserved area.
Management decisions informed by good science.
The NWHI as a control or comparison group through which we can monitor the health of the mid-Pacific and compare it to impacted reefs on the main Hawaiian Islands.
More time, more discussion, and a much stronger community input process.
15 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Maui Public Visioning Session Location: Baldwin High School Wallace, Hawaii Tuesday, July 25, 2000, 7-9:30 pm 65 Atlantis Submarine, Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Maui, Coral Reef Network, Friends of Kealia, Hawaii Audubon Society, Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, Hawaii Wildlife Fund, Hui Alanui O Makena, Hui O Pohaku, Kealailani, Maui Ocean Center, Na Kupuna O Maui, Na Moku, Pacific Whale Foundation, University of Hawaii Department of Urban Planning Department of Land and Natural Resources, DAR, Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service, National Park Service, RSIS, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Council State of Hawaii, United States Date 
In addition to the organizing questions posed at the Oahu meeting, participants were asked to identify where they believe common ground may exist between otherwise contrary positions.
Qualities to be Protected: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Participants have a high regard for the quality of the reef habitats and treasure its biodiversity.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Everyone sees the NWHI as unique habitats for flora and fauna no longer found, or found in greatly diminished proportions, on the main islands.
Many perceive the area as pristine, wild, and comparatively unaffected by human impacts and even by global warming.
The area is viewed as a nursery for marine organisms that then help populate the main Hawaiian Islands.
16 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Current and Future Threats: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Environmentalists expressed short- and long-term fears about over-fishing, bad fishing practices, and derelict fishing gear.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Fishermen fear the rise of eco-tourism, which they believe will do more damage to coral reef ecosystems than fishing.
Hawaiians fear that their cultural rights to the NWHI will be diminished at the very moment that they are seeking political sovereignty.
Some Mauians expressed specific fears about coral harvesting, vessel groundings, and the leaching of contaminants and pollutants from old military structures.
Conversely, other Mauians are concerned about over-reaching regulations that will unnecessarily inhibit cultural or economic activities in the NWHI.
Appropriate and Inappropriate Activities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cultural uses, particularly if they are exercised in pre-contact ways, are viewed as appropriate.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ There is near-universal objection to mining activities, nuclear or hazardous dumping or storage, and any kind of development that would lead to the building of new structures (hotels, golf courses, etc.).
Fish collecting for the aquarium business and the Asia live fish trade are viewed by many as inappropriate.
Many different and contrasting uses such as fishing and scientific and educational activities--are viewed as appropriate and acceptable, by many, provided those activities are controlled and limited.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Potential Government Actions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Many Mauians see lack of funding for management and preservation as the key problem.
They want substantial financial investment in management and enforcement.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Many would like to see automated Vessel Monitoring System on all vessels transiting the area.
Some people attending the meeting believe that there should be more local control over the management of the NWHI coral reef ecosystems.
People wanted more time to come up with a plan.
Visions for the Future: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cleaned up, monitored, and left alone.
17 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A clear, well-informed management plan.

18 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Kona Public Visioning Session Location: Kealakehe High School Kona, Hawaii Thursday, July 27, 2000, 7-9:30 pm 58 Captain Zodiac Raft Expeditions, Dive Makai Charters, Hawaii Prep Academy Science Department, Hawaiian Law Foundation, Hualalai Water Sports, Keep Kealakekua Wild, Kohanaiki Ohana, Kona Marine Sports Activities, Inc., Lost Fish Coalition, Malama Kai Foundation, Queen Liliuokalani Children's Center, Reef, Reef Watchers Sea Grant, Saint Peter Fishing, Sierra Club, University of Hawaii Sea Grant Extension Services DAR/Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its Maui National Wetlands Research Center, Western Regional Fisheries Management Council State of Hawaii (including Governor's Office), United States Date 
The meeting was low-key and thoughtful.
As occurred at the Maui meeting, Kona participants were asked at the end of the discussion groups to identify where they believe common ground may exist between otherwise contrary positions.
Qualities to be Protected: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Kona participants also appreciate the undisturbed, isolated, and healthy habitats that exist in the NWHI.
They perceive it to be one of Hawaii's last "wild" places and as the larval rearing and recruitment area for the other Hawaiian Islands.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Part of the uniqueness of the coral reef ecosystems derives from the array of plants and animals that live there: the monk seal, green sea turtle, spinner dolphin, albatross.
Because it is comparatively untouched, the area is highly valued for its scientific, economic, and educational opportunities.
Current and Future Threats: Ã¯Â¿Â½ In addition to concerns about refuse and debris, Kona participants feared that conflicting jurisdictions between agencies will ultimately open the door to degradation from oil spills and overuse or over-harvesting of resources.
19 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some expressed fears that new technologies such as Acoustic Thermometry Ocean Climate, fuel-efficient cruise ships, robot harvesting, and re-breathers will lead to exploitation or ecosystem damage.
Many people fear future damage from changing sea and weather patterns such as sea level rise, new storm tracks, subsidence, and bad weather.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Appropriate and Inappropriate Activities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Generally, Kona participants believe that uses that either are non-extractive, low-impact, sustainable, and that do not degrade the resources, should be permitted.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Most participants seem to believe that properly conducted educational activities are valuable.
Some believe that existing permits for uses in the NWHI must be grandfathered.
While most agreed that cultural traditions should be honored, there also should be no cultural taking until those uses are better defined and well-considered by Hawaiian people.
Potential Government Actions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Most people want additional funding and better agency coordination, but would like to see them supplemented by well-run volunteer conservation programs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some view military uses as appropriate, others as inappropriate.
Some see any management by Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council as inappropriate.
Others believe the opposite.
Some believe that all extractive activities fishing, mining, bio-prospecting, and cultural and scientific takes should be banned.
Others believe that management and enforcement must be based on clear limits.
Visions for the Future: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A place left for future generations.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A working ecosystem that has limited entry by humans.
A world model.
20 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Hilo Public Visioning Session Location: Hilo High School Hilo, Hawaii Friday, July 28, 2000, 7-9:30 pm 48 Big Island Fisherman Association, Conservation Council for Hawaii, Hawaii Wildlife Fund, Hilo Trollers, Malama O Puna, Pacific Futures, Sierra Club, Suisan Company, University of Hawaii at Hilo Marine Science Department, West Pacific Coalition Aquatic Wildlife Commission, DAR/Department of Land and Natural Resources, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Council State of Hawaii, United States Date 
A number of people at the meeting had been involved in scientific activities in the NWHI.
Qualities to be Protected: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Participants in Hilo also prize the pristine and relatively undisturbed coral reef ecosystems of the NWHI.
They note that these systems are slow-growing, fragile, and culturally and environmentally important.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some value the area as a protected and sustainable fishery for current and future generations.
Many value the area for its cultural, scientific, and educational qualities.
Current and Future Threats: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Marine debris, over-fishing, chemical spills, and pollution or destruction from human interactions are all perceived as immediate threats.
21 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Ã¯Â¿Â½ Potential future threats include unmanaged tourism, mining, and bio-prospecting, the introduction of alien species, poaching, groundings, and military activities related to Acoustic Thermometry Ocean Climate, "Star Wars," and training.
People fear resource mismanagement, inappropriate controls on uses, the perpetuation of current fishing practices, and the misuse of the area by foreign countries who are beyond the jurisdiction of U.S. agencies.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Appropriate and Inappropriate Activities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ While some believe no fishing should be allowed, many believe sustainable fisheries are appropriate.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Many people believe modest forms of tourism are appropriate but, universally, Hilo participants fear the advent of large-scale tourism.
No one spoke in favor of nuclear testing, Acoustic Thermometry Ocean Climate, dumping, mining, or resort development.
Based on what happened in Thailand with the filming of The Beach, one participant suggested that Hollywood moviemaking is an inappropriate use of the NWHI coral reef ecosystems.
Potential Government Actions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Government coordination is viewed as essential.
Hilo participants want to see agencies like U.S. Fish 
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some believe a clear protected status needs to be established around the chain.
Some argued it should be a 50-mile radius.
Others advised that it should be set by fathoms.
Several participants suggested that a commission be established that would include both the trust management agencies and non-governmental organizations with environmental, cultural, scientific, and economic interests.
Several people suggested that Native Hawaiians must play a role in on-going management.
A few people said it should be done primarily by the U.S. Fish 
Others suggested it should be Native Hawaiians working with the State of Hawaii.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Visions for the Future: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Clean water, clean air, abundant species, and a high-functioning ecosystem.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Management regimes that are carried out by Hawaiians.
The opposite of New York City.
22 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Kauai Public Visioning Session Location: Kauai Community College Lihue, Hawaii Monday, July 31, 2000, 7-9:30 pm 52 Anahola Homesteader Council, Aloha Aina Party, Hawaii Audubon Society, Hawaii Hoolau Hou, Hawaii Wildlife Tours, Kilauea NH Association, Oceanic Sanctity, Padi Divemaster, Sierra Club, Saint Peter Fishing, Teok Investigations DAR, Department of Land and Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council State of Hawaii, United States Date 
Some people representing conservation interests and some representing commercial fishing interests appeared to be reading prepared scripts and had seemingly been coached to make certain statements or take particular positions.
Nonetheless, these people were a small minority and in no way diminished the discussions which were thoughtful, civil, and engaging of the issues.
Qualities to be Protected: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Kauaians value the NWHI because it is undisturbed and an important reproductive habitat for fish, turtles, lobsters, seals, and birds.
They view it as the source of some of their own island's ocean richness.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ The NWHI offer important economic opportunities for the people of Kauai.
There are sacred sites and places of historic and cultural importance there.
People treasure the biodiversity and sheer beauty of the place.
Current and Future Threats: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some fear the loss of native rights while others, in contrast, fear that the inappropriate exercise of native rights will degrade the reef ecosystems.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Over-fishing, shipwrecks, pollution from the main islands, oil spills, anchor damage, and marine debris were all identified as current and future threats.
23 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some participants were particularly concerned about the impact of scientific researchers, whose activities are not well regulated and whose research may be extractive or intrusive.
Tourism, eco-tourism, and the commercialization of Midway were all identified as threats.
Most participants noted the lack of coordination, enforcement, and appropriate regulation.
Appropriate and Inappropriate Activities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ While some Kauai participants take more extreme positions, most seem to believe that activities that do not diminish the sustainability of resources are probably appropriate.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Most believe that very carefully limited fishing, tourism, science, and education, are appropriate.
One person argued that Hawaiians should be allowed to take a limited number of turtles for purposes of practicing traditional culture.
Others argued against this.
With the exception of coral or mineral mining, nearly all participants seemed to agree that some forms of education and research would be acceptable and appropriate.
Potential Government Actions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Most people want to see improved interagency coordination and much stronger community involvement in the planning process.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A few people argued that the NWHI coral reef ecosystems ought to be closed off entirely, including to researchers and scientists.
Some argued in favor of a boundary designation to 200 fathoms as an MPA and that 75% of the area be declared a no-take zone.
They also argued against Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council's involvement.
Conversely, others argued in favor of Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council's emerging Fisheries Management Plan and believed that any further attempts to close off new areas to fishing would be disastrous for both fishermen and seafood consumers.
Most people would like to see stepped-up efforts at marine debris removal and better monitoring of vessels using or transiting the NWHI waters.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Visions for the Future: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A protected area with maximum ecological integrity.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A working ecosystem that can accommodate multiple kinds of users.
A new National Park.
24 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ A National Marine Sanctuary managed by NOAA.

25 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Molokai Public Visioning Session Location: Mitchell Paole Community Center Kaunuakakai, Molokai Tuesday, August 1, 2000, 7-9:30 pm 30 Bingo Too Fishing, Molokai Charters, The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii DAR/Department of Land and Natural Resources, Department of Education, Department of Interior, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fishery Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, State of Hawaii, United States Date 
As in previous meetings, the group was enthusiastic in giving their input and appreciative of the displays set up by the four sponsoring agencies.
One participant asked the facilitator to convey to the Secretaries of Interior and Commerce that Molokai people will view it as an act of bad faith if the Island of Molokai is not consulted a second time before decisions are made or plans developed.
Qualities to be Protected: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Molokai participants treasure the apparent diversity of wildlife in the NWHI.
They prize the clean seawater and the nursery benefits of having protected reefs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Most like the idea that there are places tourists don't go.
Most see it is an area that is, or should be, under Hawaiian stewardship.
Current and Future and Future Threats: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Poaching, debris, over-fishing, and the aquarium trade are all seen as threats.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Molokai people believe that the most serious threat is the lack of a good plan and the failure of government to manage the area properly.
Similarly, they resent the narrow window of time in which the President's initiative is being undertaken.
26 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Appropriate and Inappropriate Activities: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Molokai participants were interested in seeing more research and study on the NWHI coral reef ecosystems.
They like the idea of Native Hawaiian cultural uses, including subsistence fishing and gathering.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Some argue that inappropriate uses include tourism, commercial fishing, mining, and unregulated recreational fishing.
Potential Government Actions: Ã¯Â¿Â½ The first and foremost responsibility of government should be to set clear boundaries.
Molokai people currently perceive a competition of jurisdictions and a general lack of good planning.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Government should expand protections for the area.
A few people argued that systemic changes are needed to control political action committees (PACs), which are the source of inappropriate political pressures to unnecessarily open or close areas in the NWHI.
Visions for the Future: Ã¯Â¿Â½ A protected resource.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Consideration for the coral reefs of Molokai and the other main islands.
Make Native Hawaiians an integral part of management.
Make government do a good job.
27 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Summary of Public Comments This section of the draft Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report summarizes the more than 1000 comments that were received during the 21-day public comment period.
Because it was apparent that many groups helped orchestrate the submission of comments by their constituencies through the use of web sites that allowed commenters to send off detailed faxes or emails with a few clicks of their mouse, or through mass faxing of pre-printed statements, while other individuals sent in long and obviously very personal handwritten letters, no attempt was made to statistically analyze the percentage of comments for or against various issues related to the management of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
Instead, this summary lists essentially every unique comment received regarding the following clusters of issues that emerged from all the comments received: Qualities to be Protected Current and Future Threats Appropriate Activities Inappropriate Activities Current Management Management Tools, Actions, and Approaches Proposed Management Structures Agency Jurisdiction Local versus Federal Control Native Hawaiian Access and Uses Boundary Suggestions for the NWHI Reported Qualifications and Experience of Commenters Qualities to be Protected in the NWHI Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ We are a unique island State.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ NMFS and WPRFMC are all about extraction of marine resources for profit, not environmental protection.
They have demonstrated they have little understanding of the concept of protecting a marine ecosystem in its entirety.
They insist harvesting various aspects of the ecosystem will have little or no consequences, without understanding the interrelationships of all the species therein.
They have been proven wrong over and over, yet they refuse to see the light.
WPRFMC's creation of Coral Reef Ecosystem Fisheries Management Plan has been disingenuous, dangerous, and inappropriate.
They don't have staff expertise or Council experience to create management plan of this magnitude and complexity.
They have rejected input from and participation by recreational fishermen, ocean recreation business and eco-tourism experts, scientists, environmentalists, and indigenous people.
True ecosystem management is not possible if large numbers of coral reef species, especially top predators, are exempted.
Their no-take areas and boundaries in draft CREFMP have no rationale.

There is no crisis; don't manufacture one to justify draconian (and likely ineffective) measures.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Seems that current highly restrictive commercial fishing could be maintained without degrading the ecosystem.
We already have lots of regulations and federal agency actions protecting these reefs.
Efforts to mitigate fisheries impacts on monk seals have been inconsistent.
In early, 1990s, reports indicated seals were interacting with rapidly expanding long-line fishery for pelagic species off NWHI.
Monk seals were found with long-line hooks embedded in their mouths and injuries suggesting they had been clubbed.
NMFS, upon recommendation of WPRFMC prohibited long-line fishing within 50 nm of NWHI.
This measure appears to have eliminated most interactions with pelagic long-line fishery.
Monk seals may be affected by depletion of prey species by commercial fishing, particularly lobster fishing and its associated by-catch.
Information suggests that monk seal decline at FFS has been due to prey limitations.
MMC began recommending in 1994, that NMFS and WPRFMC close lobster fishery around FFS pending better information on monk seal diet.
This recommendation has been consistently rejected by NMFS and WPRFMC, citing uncertainty about importance of lobster in monk seal diets and incomplete research.
Recent research over last two years indicates that lobster, in fact, are significant part of monk seal diets.
Yet, NMFS and WPRFMC continue to reject the MMC's recommendations and instead have adopted management measures that have increased lobster fishing at atolls supporting monk seal breeding colonies.
NMFS has closed lobster fishery for 2000, only because lobster stocks in NWHI are now considered overfished and seriously depleted.
While current fishery management system sometimes exercises a prudent, precautionary management approach, it cannot be relied upon to do so consistently.
It cannot assure that commercial fishing will be carried out in a safe, sustainable manner or that fishing will not adversely effect monk seals or other significant resources.
The WPFMC should continue to take the lead in reef management.
Currently, the NW Hawaiian Islands are very well managed a model for the rest of the world.
Endorse continued closure of lobster fisheries until further studies, preferably an EIS, can be completed to assess the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of the species, and until effect of stocks on well being and survivability of monk seal can be determined.
Continue 8 bottomfish permits, 2 of which are set aside for Native Hawaiian communities.
NMFS and WPRFMC should work together to determine who constitutes a "Native Hawaiian" and thereby remove obstacle to issuance of these permits.

Precious corals are protected by CREFMP.
Endangered monk seals and sea turtles are focus of federal recovery programs.

Current controls are adequate.
Consider the current controls on gear, seasonal closure and area closure to several agencies now monitor fishing around the reefs reefs are healthy and thriving.
More monitoring is needed.
Federal money is needed to beef up enforcement.
The Fishery Management Plan structure is not suited for affording the protection of the reef resources.
The WPRFMC's Coral Reef Ecosystem FMP Plan Team should be used to evaluate the current status of the reefs and the need for additional protection.
WPRFMC's CREFMP is fatally flawed and inadequate to protect the NWHI: would only regulate fisheries and not integrate management of other activities; has NMFS managing fisheries based on economic criteria rather than protection of the ecosystem; does not take ecosystem approach because bottomfish, lobster and precious corals are managed by other FMPs.
Problems with CREFMP: new species added to bottomfish FMP; exempted species already listed in other FMPs; exempts top predators; no rationale for "no-take" zones and boundaries; no take zones by fathoms cannot be enforced by USCG; FMP doesn't require VMS; Midway's no take zone is severely damaged by military use, dredging, chemical storage; no protection deeper than 10fm around Kure and Darwin Point; doesn't include Pearl 
Lobster fishery is decimated under jurisdiction of DOC. Coral reef ecosystem of NWHI is in excellent condition.

Clear majority of permit holder believe this is a viable fishery and have invested in the future by being active on Council, welcoming observers, using VMS, and self-regulated quotas on certain banks.
Fishery was not closed due to over-fishing.
Current management under WPRFMC's management plan provides for protecting those parts of the reefs that need it.
Current permitted rates of fish and lobster harvesting are far below maximum sustainable yields.
WPRFMC rules and guidelines are already preserving the NWHI marine resources.
Do we really need a new management plan? WPRFMC has already drafted CREFMP; why have Coral Reef Task Force develop recommendations? Fishing activities are already tightly controlled through permit and gear restrictions, seasonal closures, targeted area closures to protect particularly sensitive wildlife and habitats.
All human-related activities in NWHI must be scrutinized equally and evaluated for potential threats.
If properly managed, many activities conducted in NWHI can continue without harming the ecosystem.
Concerns about artificially promoting short-tail albatross colony on Midway, visits to Midway by ocean liners, and long-term agreement with Midway Phoenix Corp. on managing tourism on Midway.
Provide additional support to existing authorities to enhance understanding and ability to manage the area.
Existing agencies must be forthright in sharing of knowledge and working together to resolve concerns.
Current fishing activities are severely restricted by 4 existing FMPs.
CREFMP will additionally restrict any future efforts to exploit coral reef resources.
CREFMP was based on two assessment studies that suggested need for precautionary measure.
WPRFMC, upon recommendation of Coral Reef Task Force and CEQ, held joint meeting of 9 advisory groups that had worked on CREFMP to iron out differences.

DOC and DOI should include WPRMFC in any discussion of additional protection measures.
The membership of the WPRFMC should be broadened so that they are not dominated by commercial fishing interests.
Department of the Interior, US Fish and Wildlife Service, with State Department of Lands and Natural Resources/DAR, and the US Coast Guard Enforcement Division.
A combination of Federal, State and local environmental, resource and economic agencies and groups.
Shared management and permitting authority between USFWS and State Department of Lands and Natural Resources/DAR, with NMFS and WPRFMC in minimized advisory capacity, and with broad participation from Hawaiian community.

Joint management committee of seven including: Kanaka Maoli Hawaii (Cultural); Kanaka Maoli Hawaii (Subsistence); Environmental NGO; Wildlife/Marine NGO; USFWS; HI DLNR; USCG Enforcement Division.
Council set up to oversee area, to include Maoli practitioners, non-exploitive practitioners, enforcement agencies, and USFWS.
Include Native Hawaiian, recreational fishermen, and scientific community representation on WPRFMC.
Independent reviewing group representing all interests, including federal agencies, to review data from the region, assess its accuracy, and recommend alternative conclusions, review monitoring and enforcement policies, programs, and activities, review all plans and policies and make recommendations.
Hawaii council of Native Hawaiians to promote conservation programs Office of Hawaii Affairs, Royal Order of Kamehameha, Aha Hui Kaahumanu Society, Hawaiian Civic Clubs should be involved in process through MOU. Office of Hawaii Affairs should be consulted in working cooperatively towards a solution.
Any bio-prospecting contracts should be negotiated with Kanaka Maoli to ensure data and research benefits to native people of Hawaii.
World Heritage site governed by board of relevant persuasions - scientists, native HI, conservationists, fishers.
Management decisions made by people of Hawaii.
Establish joint Federal/State Coral Reef Emergency Response Team.
Let fish biologists who are neutral, without conflict of interest set limits.
Show leadership by not furthering political interests.
Agency policies should be clear and parallel to provide resource protection.
Need simple clear cut guidelines.
DOI and DOC should not only work together, but also with the public and conservationists and most importantly, those who know the NWHI, fishermen in developing comprehensive management plan.
Any new plan should take into account and build upon efforts of WPRFMC.

Agency Jurisdiction of the NWHI Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ USFWS designated lead with MOU with HI. Generally, WPRFMC manages fisheries well.
Opposes WPRFMC having control over decisions regarding management of NWHI.
Prefer management decisions made by DOI, as opposed to DOC. DOI not Commerce Identify "core area" of NWHI consisting of HINWR, with appropriate management designation, such as a National Marine Sanctuary, National Monument, or other designation for core area outside HINWR management area.
Suggests NWHI chain should be designated a Marine and Terrestrial Wildlife Reserve under the USFWS, NPS and State of HI; opposes WPRFMC having control; all plans for managing NWHI should be placed under USDOI; form governing council of rep's from State of HI, federal agencies, marine scientists, native Hawaiians, environmentalists and all user groups.
USFWS should have primary jurisdiction with adequate funding from Congress because area must be protected in perpetuity for future generations.
Thoroughly oppose WPRFMC having control over decisions.
Fisheries Management Council should not create or manage the plan (just a "fishing industry lobbyist").
Considers president's decree as bad precedent.
Thinks decree removes NWHI from jurisdiction of WPFMC.
Kure to Nihoa should be designated a Marine 
Minimize participation by all agencies of DOC. NMFS and WPRFMC are all about extraction of marine resources for profit, not environmental protection.
They have demonstrated they have little understanding of the concept of protecting a marine ecosystem in its entirety.
They insist harvesting various aspects of the ecosystem will have little or no consequences, without understanding the inter-relationships of all the species therein.
They have been proven wrong over and over, yet they refuse to see the light.
They Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ 55 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report are advisory body only, with no real public accountability or trustee authority over US coral reef resources.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ USFWS should be the lead agency.
Congress gave jurisdiction to WPRFMC and they have done a good job.
Continue management through DOC and the Council.
Take advise from Native Hawaiian organizations.
WPFMC is already carefully managing the islands.
DOI/USFWS have primary jurisdiction with adequate Congressional funding.
USFWS and HI as final authorities.
DOC should not be given control over jurisdiction and management of NWHI, whose interests are corporate economic interests, not protection of the natural resources and cultural rights, both ecological and cultural.
Opposes control by WPRFMC; "fox in the chicken coop."
Decisions should be made by DOI, not DOC.
Extend NWS Wildlife Refuges out to 50nm or establish new National Monument to be managed by USFWS.
All human activities subject to approval of USFWS in consultation of other involved agencies.
USFW, DLNR, NOAA, Navy, and US Fisheries.
Also need to include NPS.
Support management by WPRFMC and NMFS.
FWS should maintain decision-making authority over all resources including fisheries within HI and Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuges.
State of HI should maintain authority within State waters outside Refuges.
DOC should maintain authority over the EEZ seaward of the Refuges (as could be modified by advice from the Committee.)
The WPFMC should maintain jurisdiction, but the MPA it developed is overly protective and without scientific basis.
Balance of authorities, including current or expanded Midway and HINWR, CREFMP by WPRFMC, Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance, and other authorities available to the President.

USFWS should manage area rather than partner with DOC. DOC not adequate resource managers.
DOI should have jurisdiction along with proposed Committee.
Difficult to balance natural management approaches in overlapping state, national international jurisdictions and arbitrary boundaries.
Opposes jurisdiction other than WPFMC DOI/USFWS with adequate funding.
Management authority should be retained by WPRFMC in consultation with HI, NMFS, and other federal agencies and Coral Reef Task Force as appropriate.
WPRFMC should not be in "consulting" role to Coral Reef Task Force; rather, HI and WPRFMC should take lead and consult with Task Force.
Authority of WPRFMC for coral reef resources in federal waters of EEZ should remain as proscribed by Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
WPRFMC looks forward to working with other agencies and organizations, with different authorities and jurisdictions, to achieve coordinated and comprehensive management and protection of NWHI coral reef ecosystem.
Status quo is best.
No new federal initiatives are needed.
Federal government needs to clarify boundary of Hawaiian Islands NWR.
Uncertainty and disagreement has resulted in inter-agency conflict about jurisdictional boundaries.
Boundary question could be resolved by Presidential Executive Order, federal regulation, or by statute.
Boundary clarification would improve ability of agencies to work together.

Joint state and fed control Local researchers should have the say - don't need coalitions or decisions made in DC or Portland.
Specific decisions by people of HI. Keep foreign countries (ie. US feds) out of the islands Allowed non-commercial uses should be determined by people of HI. Local interests should be taken into account.
Thinks USFWS and federal government should have returned submerged land in NWHI to HI. Meeting is a "shibai" suggesting that DLNR has jurisdictional power to manage NWHI resources.
HI can only go along with what federal government dictates.
People of HI don't have control of fishing in HI.
No more federal ownership or control -- "it has become a cancer in our lives".
People of HI determine appropriate noncommercial uses.
More federal actions will be redundant and wasteful.
The Clinton Administration is confused.
State and federal management framework with goals for compatible uses.
WPMRFC should be involved with DOI and DOC Primary authority over NWHI should be retained by HI, WPRFMC, HI residents and other HI-based stakeholders, because they are most familiar with the region and therefore better equipped to address conservation and management issues than policy makers in DC.

Native Hawaiians did not historically use this area so they should not have cultural or religious claims.
No evidence exists for Hawaiian habitation of any island north of Nihoa and Necker; creates dilemma on how far Hawaiian rights should extend.
"To enhance the revitalization of Native Hawaiian Culture and to correspond with the vision of the State and Federal government's view of native culture, management of the NWHI must allow for the inclusion of the native voice in the decision-making process.

State owes trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians to protect their traditional and customary fishing and gathering rights in NWHI based on ceded lands and waters to US following overthrow of Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893, which were later transferred to state of HI under terms of Admissions Act.
Federal government should be aware of trust obligations owed Native Hawaiians before formulating and implementing plans for NWHI.

64 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Public Input Report Appendices 65 Appendix A Presidential Directive for Secretaries of Interior and Commerce for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Appendix A Presidential Directive May 26, 2000 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE SUBJECT: Protection of U.S. Coral Reefs in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands The world's coral reefs -- our tropical rain forests of the water are in serious decline.
These important and sensitive areas of biodiversity warrant special protection.
While the United States has only 3 percent of the world's coral reefs, nearly 70 percent of U.S. coral reefs are in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.
Many of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands' coral, fish, and invertebrate species are unique, and the area is home to endangered Hawaiian monk seals and threatened turtles.
In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt set aside certain islands and reefs in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands for the protection of sea birds.
Today, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages this area as the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge.
In June 1998, I signed an Executive Order for Coral Reef protection (E.O. 13089), which established the Coral Reef Task Force and directed all Federal agencies with coral reef-related responsibilities to develop a strategy for coral reef protection.
States and territories with coral reefs were invited to be full partners with the Federal Government in preparing an action plan to better protect and A-1 Appendix A Presidential Directive preserve the Nation's coral reef ecosystems.
In March of this year, the Task Force issued the National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs.
The Plan lays out a science-based road map to healthy coral reefs for future generations, based on two fundamental strategies: promoting understanding of coral reef ecosystems by, for example, conducting comprehensive mapping, assessment, and monitoring of coral reefs; and reducing the adverse impacts of human activities by, for example, creating an expanded and strengthened network of Federal, State, and territorial coral reef Marine Protected Areas, reducing the adverse impact of extractive uses, and reducing habitat destruction.
It is time now to take the Coral Reef Task Force's recommendations and implement them to ensure the comprehensive protection of the coral reef ecosystem of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands through a coordinated effort among the Departments of the Interior and Commerce and the State of Hawaii.
Accordingly, I have determined that it is in the best interest of our Nation, and of future generations, to provide strong and lasting protection for the coral reef ecosystem of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, and I am directing you to initiate an administrative process to that end.
Specifically, I direct you, working cooperatively with the State of Hawaii and consulting with the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council, to develop recommendations within 90 days for a new, coordinated management regime to increase protection of the ecosystem and provide for sustainable use.
Further, I direct that your recommendations address A-2 Appendix A Presidential Directive whether appropriate stewardship for the submerged lands and waters of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands warrants exercise of my authority to extend permanent protection to objects of historic or scientific interest or to protect the natural and cultural resources of this important area.
The recommendations should also: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Review the status and adequacy of all ongoing efforts to protect the coral reef ecosystem, including proposed no-take ecological reserves and the ongoing work of the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council; Ã¯Â¿Â½ To the extent permitted by law, ensure that any actions that the Departments of the Interior and Commerce authorize, fund, or carry out will not degrade the conditions of the coral reef ecosystems; Ã¯Â¿Â½ Identify any further measures necessary to protect cultural and historic resources and artifacts; Ã¯Â¿Â½ Identify any further measures necessary for the protection of the ecosystem's threatened and endangered species, including the endangered monk seal, sea turtles, and short-tailed albatross; Ã¯Â¿Â½ Establish a framework for scientific research and exploration; Ã¯Â¿Â½ Establish a framework for facilitating recreation and tourism in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands consistent with the protection and sustainable management of the ecosystem; Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide for culturally significant uses of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands' marine resources by Native Hawaiians; and A-3 Appendix A Presidential Directive Ã¯Â¿Â½ Address the development of a cooperative framework, in consultation with the State of Hawaii and the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council, to ensure that the goals set forth above will be implemented in a cooperative manner, consistent with existing authorities.
I also direct that during the 90-day period, the Departments shall conduct "visioning" sessions, which would provide opportunities for public hearing and comment to help shape the final recommendations.
With this new effort, we are taking strides to fulfill the goal of the Coral Reef Task Force to protect our precious coral reefs for the benefit of future generations.

OK, with those preliminaries, let me quote a few pieces of the memo that is driving tonight's meeting: "The world's coral reefs -- our tropical rain forests of the water are in serious decline.
These important and sensitive areas of biodiversity warrant special protection.
While the United States has only 3 percent of the world's coral reefs, nearly 70 percent of US coral reefs are in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.
"In June 1998, I signed an Executive Order for Coral Reef protection (E.O. 13089), which established the Coral Reef Task Force and directed all Federal agencies with coral reef-related responsibilities to develop a strategy for coral reef protection."

Based on this, the purposes of this meeting is to: Ã¯Â¿Â½ To learn more about the coral reef ecosystems of the NW Islands.
B-1 Appendix B Facilitator's Introduction to the Public Visioning Sessions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ To gather ideas about the qualities, threats, and uses associated with those reefs.
To provide the secretaries of Interior and Commerce with your comments on the various visions of those reef systems.
This particular meeting is sponsored by the 4 agencies designated by the President.
They are: the Department of Commerce, the Department of Interior, the State of Hawaii (DL
You will also see and hear the name of the USIECR referred to tonight.
USIECR is a nonpartisan problem-solving agency that has been selected as a neutral entity to conduct the meetings and document public input process.
Tonight's facilitation team is working under their auspices and it will be our responsibility to produce a Report of the results of this public input process which will be made available publicly and which will accompany the agencies' recommendation to the President.
Introduce facilitation team: Kem Lowry, Miki Lee, Donna Shanefelter, and others.
This Visioning Session won't be conducted using the format of a traditional Public Hearing in which audience members are typically provided three minutes at the microphone to present their testimony to a panel of agency officials.
Rather, the sponsoring agencies are seeking to use these Visioning Sessions to promote public dialogue about the future of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and to really work towards a unified vision.
Our agenda tonight is as follows: (see wallchart) For those unable to stay to participate in the small group discussions, Public Comment forms are available that can be completed and turned in here, submitted via a web site, mailed, or faxed to the address listed on the form.
Your comments will be used to inform the Departments of the Interior and Commerce as they develop their recommendation to the President.
Please note that the deadline for submission is August 2nd.
Let me also introduce some of the agency representatives who are here tonight.
These are people who I encourage you to talk to later on: Ã¯Â¿Â½ DOC: Rusty Brainard from the National Marine Fisheries Service Ã¯Â¿Â½ DOI: Rob Shallenberger, Barbara Maxfield, and Dave Johnson from the US Fish and Wildlife service Ã¯Â¿Â½ State of Hawaii: Bill Devick Ã¯Â¿Â½ Western Pacific Fishery Management Council: Kitty Simonds and Sylvia Spaulding I also want to say a few words about the work of these four agencies because they each play an important role in the NWHI.
Despite the fact that they have different and overlapping missions that might seem at odds, they have agreed to work together to both conduct these meetings and to try to evolve the kind of coordination and balancing that is needed.
Each of them is involved in one or more ongoing, regional efforts to manage the coral reef resources of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
B-2 Appendix B Facilitator's Introduction to the Public Visioning Sessions The Department of the Interior, through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, has been managing the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in the NW Islands since it was established in 1909.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has also managed Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge since 1988 and is responsible for the protection of migratory seabirds and the recovery of numerous threatened or endangered species.
The Department of Commerce has a number of responsibilities for the coral reef ecosystem of the Northwestern Islands including management of commercial fisheries through the National Marine Fisheries Service and through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA.
They have responsibility for protection and recovery of the endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal and other marine mammals, sea turtles and other species.
In the State of Hawaii's waters in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, the Department of Land and Natural Resources is responsible for the management and conservation of marine resources and is in the process of designating the region as a Fisheries Management Area.
The State also manages Kure Atoll as a Wildlife Sanctuary.
The Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, which operates under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, oversees fisheries policies in the federal waters of the Exclusive Economic Zone around American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, and other U.S. islands in the Pacific.
Reminder: the agency representatives are here to listen.
We have asked them to withhold pushing any particular point of view and to use this opportunity to hear your ideas.

2.
Civility.
We know that differences of opinion are inevitable, especially when we talk about sensitive environmental and cultural issues.
The one thing we ask tonight is civility which comes down to: Listen hard Say your say and don't monopolize the conversation.
Stay patient because we are in a large group.
B-3 Appendix C Script of Slide Show Used at the Public Visioning Sessions Appendix C- Script of the Slide Show at the Public Visioning Sessions Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Slide Show 1) Map of region The NWHIs are made up of over 1,000 miles of territory--stretching from Nihoa to Kure Atoll; the area includes 10 emergent islands atolls and shoals with extensive reef systems.
It is home to numerous protected species, which will be detailed later in this presentation.
The next few slides provide will provide you with an overview of the region's geography: 2) Nihoa aerial Nihoa lies 130 miles northwest of Niihau, and stands 910 feet tall and is the largest volcanic island in the northern chain.
This island is made up of 171 acres of emergent land and 142,000 acres of coral reef habitat.
It is home to 2 endangered land birds and numerous plants.
3) Necker aerial Necker island is shaped like a fish hook and includes 46 acres of emergent land and more than 380,000 acres of coral reef habitat.
4) French Frigate Shoals aerial French Frigate Shoals is a crescent-shaped atoll made up of 67 acres of emergent land and 230,000 acres of coral reef habitat.
It is the main nesting and breeding area for green sea turtle and is an important breeding area for monk seals.
5) Gardner Pinnacles aerial Gardner Pinnacles is made of up two pinnacles with a mere 5 acres of land, not much above water; however, it is host to 600,000 acres of coral reef habitat, making it the largest submerged habitat area in the chain.
Gardner Pinnacle is also an important nesting site for 12 species of seabirds.
6) Maro Reef aerial Maro Reef is a largely submerged atoll totaling less than an acre of land.
It hosts 475,000 acres of coral reef habitat and is an important fisheries area.
7) Laysan Island aerial Laysan Island is the largest of the islands with 1,015 acres of land and a hyper-saline lake--one of only 5 natural lakes in Hawai`i.
The island is made up of 145,000 acres of coral reef habitat and is an important monk seal breeding ground.
It is also home to 2 species of endangered birds-the Laysan duck and finch).
8) Lisianski Island aerial Lisianski Island is made of up 400 acres of emergent land, and lies at the northern end of a large reef bank spanning 65 miles.
The atoll features 310,00 acres of coral reef habitat and is a critically important breeding area for monk seals.
C-1 Appendix C- Script of the Slide Show at the Public Visioning Sessions 9) Pearl and Hermes Atoll aerial Pearl and Hermes Atoll is a large atoll with 80 acres of land with several small islets mostly washed over in winter storms.
The atoll features 200,000 acres of coral reef habitat, offering incredible patch reefs and other coral reef formations in the lagoon.
10) Midway Atoll aerial Midway atoll is made up of three small islands, totaling 1,549 acres and 5 miles across.
The atoll features 55,000 acres of reef habitat, and is home to over 2 million nesting Laysan and black-footed Albatross each winter.
The area is designated and managed as the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.
11) Kure Atoll aerial Kure Atoll is the northern most atoll in the world.
The atoll has 212 acres of land and 80,000 acres of coral reef habitat, and is an important breeding area for monk seals and seabirds.
The area is managed as a State Wildlife Sanctuary.
So what makes these Islands so special? 12) Coral reef pie chart slide The Hawaiian archipelago has over 80% of all coral reefs under U.S. jurisdiction.
And nearly 70% of these coral reefs are found in the NWHIs.
13) Coral reef slide The NWHIs include a much greater diversity of reef habitats than the main Hawaiian Islands.
Over 7,000 marine species have been recorded in Hawaii, and as many as half of the species in some of these groups exist only in the NWHIs.
The reefs serve as a source to help restock several species found in the main Hawaiian Islands.
14) Kure Atoll coral reef slide Kure Atoll provides scientists opportunities to study the "Darwin Point"--where the rate of coral growth barely equals the rate of island submergence.
The Hawaiian archipelago provides scientists a unique opportunity to study the evolution of islands--from their volcanic origins, to the point where they become atolls and eventually drown.
15) Morwong fish slide (unique coral reef organisms) There are also many species seen in the NWHIs that are rarely seen in the main Hawaiian Islands, but are common in other parts of the Pacific.
This morwong reef fish is an example; It is found throughout the Pacific, but rarely seen around the main islands.
16) Uninhabited atoll slide Most of the islands and atolls of the NWHIs have been protected for nearly 100 years.
Their relatively intact marine and terrestrial communities offer us the opportunity to see what the main Hawaiian Islands ecosystems may have been like before the arrival of the first Polynesians.
C-2 Appendix C- Script of the Slide Show at the Public Visioning Sessions 17) Seabird photo These small islands provide most of the nesting habitat for more than 14 million Pacific seabirds.
Almost all of the world's Laysan and black-footed Albatross return to these islands to reproduce.
In addition, 17 other species of seabirds also nest in the islands, and many rely on the coral reefs for food.
18) Land bird photo Only four species of land birds are still found in the NWHIs, and all are endangered.
Several other species have been lost within the past few centuries.
This is a photo of a Laysan duck the three other species that are left include: the Laysan finch, Nihoa finch, and the Nihoa millerbird.
19) Mo Mo Pr o Green sea turtle photo re than 90% of the Hawaiian population of green sea turtles nests at French Frigate Shoals. st of the turtles migrate to the main Hawaiian Islands to feed and then return to breed.
tecting their breeding habitat is vital to maintaining the population.
20) Monk seal photo The highly endangered Hawaiian monk seal breed and feed in the NWHIs.
The current population is estimated at no more than 1,400 animals.
The Hawaiian monk seal is one of the animals found only in Hawaii and the importance of protecting their habitat is crucial.
21) Hawaiian spinner dolphin photo Many of the atolls in the NWHIs provide protection for Hawaiian spinner dolphins to safely rest during daylight hours.
Several other species of mammal also transit through the area.
In addition to the environmental significance, the area also has cultural significance: 22) Nihoa cultural slide Nihoa Island was once inhabited by as many as 175 people.
Artifacts, including house terraces, ceremonial structures, burial caves, bluff shelters and agricultural terraces show a close relationship w/the main Hawaiian islands 23) Necker cultural slide The Hawaiian name for Necker island is Moku Manamana.
This island was a major ceremonial site and heiau.
24) Cultural fishing slide Logs from the earliest Westerners to visit Hawaii describe Native Hawaiian canoes heading to the northwestern islands for turtles and seabirds.
The islands have been fishing grounds for the people of Hawaii for centuries.
Artifacts found on Nihoa include many Hawaiian fishing artifacts.
C-3 Appendix C- Script of the Slide Show at the Public Visioning Sessions 25) Laysan guano mining slide The North Pacific Phosphate and Fertilizer Co. leased several islands for guano extraction.
Development of land-based facilities was most significant on Laysan Island, where a small community existed in the 1890's.
Harvesting also occurred on Lisianski Island.
26) Laysan Albatross slide This is a photo of hundreds of the Laysan Albatross, which are named after the island, but their numbers have greatly decreased due to the habitat destruction that occurred from the release of rabbits on the island during the guano mining operations.
27) WWII shot During WWII, the Navy built a base at Midway Atoll.
The battle of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific and is an important historic reminder of service men during that battle.
Midway and French Frigate Shoals were significantly altered during the war for the construction of Naval facilities.
28) Post War fisheries slide Local commercial fishing began as early as 1917 in the NWHI, but was suspended during the War.
Local fishermen used the Navy-built airstrip at Tern Island (on French Frigate Shoal) to fly products to Honolulu.Lobster, akule, reef fish, bottomfish and turtles were caught until the Honolulu market declined in the late 1950s.
29) Post War fisheries slide Foreign fleets harvested tuna, billfish, precious coral and groundfish using longliners, pole-andline vessels, draggers and trawlers.
Foreign fleets were excluded from 200 miles around the area when the Fishery Conservation and Management Act was signed into law in 1976.
Economic activities and opportunities also lie in the area: 30) Lobster Fishery slide The majority of lobsters caught commercially in Hawaii are caught in the NWHIs.
The fishery is limited to around 10 vessels, and is restricted by area closures, an 8-month seasonal closure, harvest guidelines by bank, and gear restrictions.
The fishery is closed for this year.
31) Bottomfish Fishery slide The NWHIs provide about half the bottomfish landed commercially in Hawaii.
The fish found here are larger than those found around the main Hawaiian islands, and are important to local restaurants specializing in fresh fish.
This is a "limited entry" fishery, with only 17 vessels allowed to fish.
32) Eco-tourism slide Midway Atoll is the only remote island National Wildlife Refuge open to public visitation.
Tourists are invited to visit Midway to learn about and enjoy its unique wildlife and historic resources.
The number of visitors allowed is limited to reduce impacts to the wildlife.
C-4 Appendix C- Script of the Slide Show at the Public Visioning Sessions 33) Education slide A small number of photographers and film crews are permitted to the various islands to document the unique wildlife and provide information on the islands to the larger public.
The University of Hawaii at Hilo also offers classes at Midway Atoll.
Potential threats to the area include... 34) Storms/waves Storms and changing oceanographic conditions are a primary threat to these islands.
Major winter storms, hurricanes, and tidal waves lash these islands, on occasion leaving all land awash and significantly reducing coral cover.
35) Marine debris nets slide Ocean currents have deposited thousands of pounds of discarded nets onto the reefs.
Nets and lines entangle and drown all types of marine life, they also scour the coral and smother it, eventually killing it.
36) Marine debris plastics slide Other types of marine debris include plastics and other types of vessel operations gear that washes onto the reefs and ashore on the islands.
Floating plastic is eaten by adult seabirds and fed to their young, often killing the chicks.
37) Shipwreck slide The assortment of vessels that transit the area raises the potential for accidental groundings on the reefs.
Oil spills, debris from the ship on the reefs, and the effects of the ship hitting the reef and crushing the coral are all possible impacts.
There have been two shipwrecks in the past 20 months in this area.
38) Anchor damage Dropping of anchors or traps can also damage the coral reef.
The level of this damage is currently unknown given the limited research and commercial fishing activity occurring there.
39) Ulua fishing slide Over-fishing has had documented effects on coral reef ecosystems.
Effects can include not only impacts from the gear but also reduced species distribution, abundance and size of individuals.
40) Monk seal slide (Human disturbance) Human interaction can disturb the marine animals.
While well-intentioned, some research has had negative impacts on the monk seals.
Unrestricted ecotourism activities could also pose a threat to these sensitive animals.
41) Eroding seawall slide Deteriorating military infrastructure poses additional problems for the marine life.
Disintegrating sea walls, such as this one at Tern Island, can entrap monk seals and sea turtles.
C-5 Appendix C- Script of the Slide Show at the Public Visioning Sessions There are several types of partnership programs that exist to manage the area: 42) Monk seal and seal turtle slide Partnerships first begin with the inter-relationships among the organisms themselves.
43) Marine debris cooperative program slide A 14-member multi-agency marine debris clean up effort has been working for several years to document and eliminate the marine debris build up in the NWHIs.
Since the mid-1990s, over 100,000 pounds of net and line have been removed from these islands as part of this effort.
Most of these agencies are also working together to sponsor an International Conference on Derelict Fishing Gear, which will be held in Honolulu, August 6-11.
44) Early research slide One of the most extensive efforts to document the resources of the NWHIs was done over a 5year period of time between the late 1970s and early 1980s and was a cooperative effort between the State of Hawaii, the University, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Over a 100 research projects were undertaken during this time frame.
45) Current research slide The three trust resource management agencies, the State, FWS and NMFS cooperate on several research projects each summer in the NWHIs.
Field camps are set up on most of the islands each summer to study the monk seals.
46) USCG C-130 (or vessel) slide Numerous cooperative enforcement efforts are ongoing throughout the region.
The US Coast Guard provides a much need presence for all agencies in the area and takes on the bulk of the enforcement effort.
47) Turtle crawling up the beach slide Although much has been done to protect the vast coral reef resources of the region, much more can be accomplished through a unified effort to provide strong and lasting protection for the NWHIs.
We hope this presentation has given you background on the area.
Mahalo for taking time this evening to share your comments and suggestions with us.
