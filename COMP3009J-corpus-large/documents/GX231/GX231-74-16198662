There was something about Celeste's story in Youth Today that compelled me to write to her about her work with kids at risk...I had written to the others in the article as well.
However, Celeste responded and I haven't asked her why yet.
But that's how this mural keeps going.
My husband and I drove to Riverside from San Diego while we were in California for the holidays and Celeste showed up but none of the kids or outreach workers did...one of those things that just happens.
We liked Celeste.
She was warm and smiling and we could feel her sincerity in wanting the kids to show up to do this mural.
But filled with Christmas cheer and having done murals for about 10 days straight we almost welcomed the little window of freedom.
I kept in touch with Celeste...or she with me, and today, close to 6 weeks later, I drove with my new helper, Victoria in her shiney white jeep off to Riverside.
Celeste arrived before anyone else carrying about 8 boxes of pizza and other goodies, her think body weighted down with bags of ice to boot! Still, her warmth and inner kindness was evident as she quietly arranged everything in anticipation of the kids who would arrive soon.
Since we had arrived a few minutes earlier at the Park Recreation Center we had already started to unbundle our paints and canvas and tarps and brushes, and other instruments of the mural miles...I had only primed the canvas at 0600 and had to dry it in my daughter's living room with a fan, before I folded it loosely so it wouldn't stick together in transit...lucky for us, it was completely dry.
Several young men began drifting in.
The older teens were dressed like normal teenagers with those pants big and baggy, baseball jackets, fubu shirts, ball caps and giant tennis shoes, hand dug into their pockets.
A bit shy, but courteous.
The first arrivals were Latinos...all with the shaved short haircuts and gorgeous with big black eyes and long curly lashes...the kind that women only dream of.
Soon to follow were a couple of young African-American guys...corn row haircuts, snug caps, but otherwise looking as cool as their Latino counterparts.
Shortly thereafter a young and attractive tall woman arrived.
She wore no makeup but was pretty with a wonderful shock of curly hair pulled tight into a cascading pony tail.
The outreach workers were there also interested, curious..who knows, but also very courteous and ready to help in any way.
While they munched on the pizza, I sort of went over my usual experiences and background information about the murals...and I could see that they were listening but were well prepared for yet another one of those do-gooder-speakers.
However, when I told them about some of my adventures and how as a young minority high school kid, and how I left my hometown to escape the small little bigoted world only to find danger and injury out there...they seemed to take notice.
They became even more attentive when I told them about being attacked and how even though I rose to diplomatic levels, I had discovered that life is the same more or less, everywhere.
They seemed to look at me a bit different...maybe one of the things I shared about my own past affected them...maybe it was being in a room with people that cared...maybe it was Celeste's determination that they would see and feel the benefit from this experience.
This we will never know.
When we first began, everyone seemed to be brain dead.
They didn't know it...buy many of the murals start that way.
It was Franchune who decided she wanted to put hearts on the mural...symbolizing love...how neat that was! And once the paint goes on, the others follow, as did this group as well.
Soon came the Aztec calendar, Riverside symbols, and messages, oranges and orange blossoms, and a brown and a black hand grasping eachother.
What I didn't know that some of these young people were from opposing street gangs.
No one else from the outside would have known that either..because there they were, together on the floor painting together...forgetting about turf, about ethnicity, about neighborhoods.
To me, the mural magic was working again and all I can tell you is that Mysa (pronounced Messiah), Jesus, Antonio, Mondo, Franchune, Fabian, Fernando, Louis and Keirie, all had something special to contribute to that mural.
I like to call it peace and tolerance and understanding.
And even more beautiful is that several of them said they wish they had more time...and in the end, Antonio asked that we leave it behind so that care could be given to finishing it properly.
That was moving in and of itself....showing that as Fouad and I have believed all along, all young people only want to be seen and heard and understood...if only given the chance.
And so tonite, Celeste, we thank you...for making love ...wonderful the second time around....! At my daughter's home in Vista...and she never knew I had a wet canvas in her living room! back to TOP
Amber's Mural __________________________________________________________________
by Joanne Tawfilis, April 6, 2001
I saw her on her bicycle near the gallery, this slender young girl with her brown hair flying in the breeze.
I could see her in my rear view mirror and saw that she was watching me as a swung the car into a parking space by the front door.
As soon as I unlocked the door and turned to pull up the Venetian blinds, I could see that she was headed in my direction.
I stood at the door and opened it as she approached.
It seemed she had known me all her life as she breathlessly entered the gallery.
Her first words burst forth like the March winds with "Thank God, I finally got in here...I've been dying to get in here and see the art and what is going on here!" She neglected to tell me her name and walked about in circular motion...in awe of the art on the walls and the murals that still hung from Fouad's latest photo session.
Her eyes and mouth were wide open as she continued what almost seemed like a dance.
I was taking pleasure in her joy but finally asked her name.
"My name is Amber Lee Davis," she said.
"Why aren't you in school, Amber?" I asked.
Amber revealed to me that she was a "home schooled" child and chattered on about how she had been delivered at birth at home, with her Dad as the midwife and that he lived in Nashville and her Mom lived here and home schooled her.
She was all of nine years old and looked like she could eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches all day long.
Her energy was mighty as she grabbed paper and markers and made herself comfortable with drawing.
I immediately took a liking to her and we chatted a bit about our unique gallery and how we would soon be turning it over to children to operate-a crazy idea to some, but one that we were modeling from one already in operation.
She proceeded to draw and paint and seemed to work quickly sketching three or four pages of drawings with markers and then watercolors.
After awhile and after looking once more at the mural on the wall decided it was something she wanted to do.
She got up, touched the mural, gingerly tracing the designs with her fingertips and decided she would work on one that was unfinished on the floor.
She politely asked permission and started gathering needed brushes and water and a palette.
She carefully selected her colors and started working on the mural.
She became totally focused on the mural and her painting and seemed to be enjoying herself immensely.
After a short while, her father appeared at the door and stayed to chat for quite awhile about the gallery, the children's art, and the fact that Amber was alone a lot and was looking for something to do like this in the area.
He stated he lived in Nashville and commuted back and forth to be with his family.
Then he left, leaving Amber and me in the gallery to putts along at what we were doing.
It was a nice time and as evening darkness began to come, I told Amber we would have to finish up.
She cleaned up her surroundings and seemed pretty satisfied at her work on the mural.
While she was washing up, I looked at her drawings...they were really neat.
Obviously, she had done a painting of me while we were talking, and I was really quite taken and flattered that she had been so thoughtful and chose me to draw.
Before we parted, she expressed her enthusiasm and excitement about joining our gallery and meeting the kids that would run it and hearing all about World Environment Day Plans.
We agreed to meet the next day at 2:00 pm.
The next day, I was detained by other appointments and couldn't get to the gallery.
However, Amber did leave a message at my office and said she was coming to the gallery that afternoon.
The next morning, the business owner next door to the gallery informed me that Amber had left a message that she was never coming back to Kinder Artistas Gallery.
I immediately felt a sickening lump in my throat and a pit in my tummy for having disappointed Amber.
However, what I was told is that Amber had to leave during the night with her Father to go to Nashville because someone had turned her family in for being alone all the time.
Apparently her mother worked all day and Amber was left to her own devices during the day.
I was heartsick because I knew that Amber really did have a sensing that she could belong to the gallery, that here was a safe haven for her, that here she would meet children she could associate and be with.
And so, even though the tears in my heart and in my eyes cannot make up for Amber's loneliness and need, I have her portrait of me, and her wonderful touches on the mural, that to me will always be Amber's mural.
I can't help but think about how many little Amber's there are out there...and how many murals it would take to give them something that makes them feel as good as she made me feel when she was with me there.

Woodstock Home School __________________________________________________________________
by Joanne Tawfilis, June 20, 2000
Woodstock Home School Network - On the path of The Visual Mile
Katarina Rickens.
Neat name and a neat lady who was passed a flyer during the Bard College Children Human Rights Exhibition in March.
I drove four hours up there through the entire state of Connecticut to the Catskill Mountains to meet her and the children who participate in another kind of school-a school run by parents, caring parents and people who really love children.
It was evident.
Katarina lives on a farm that looks like a storybook.
Children were everywhere laughing, smiling, climbing on walls and sitting under trees.
I noticed a neat sandbox filled with toy dump trucks-another sign of children who are allowed to play, not just sit in front of a television.
Katarina is a pretty woman from Sweden, obviously married to a partner who must love children as much as she.
It was evident.
A lifestyle like that takes a team or maybe, as Hillary Clinton says, "It Takes a Village".
The farm was abuzz with dogs meandering around, a horse and I could see other animals and ponds that looked like a mini-lake, outbuildings with pretty wooded shingles, and those wonderful children and their sounds and movement.
I thought of the children in Bosnia, alone and solemn, missing their parents and friends.
Somehow they haunt me and I carry their image with me always.
But today, Katarina and Joseph, the two beautiful children with dreadlocks, Connor 1 and Connor 2, the Elizabeth Taylor girl child with violet eyes, and the brother and sister with bright red hair and chestnut eyes, stroked my heart and took me away from all that sorrow into an enchanted land of warmth and friendliness, comradery, and caring.
Amazingly enough, we drove to a park! The park reminded me of being in a bowl, decorated by broccoli trees-thick broccoli trees.
This was the Catskill Mountains.
More children, more laughter, and the totality of nature, hugging, surrounding, protecting me from all the stress of the other world I had driven away from.
I met Katherine and Pati and another wonderful woman named Julie Brinkmann.
Again...more kids, more laughter and a lot of love shimmering around them like halos.
All beautiful braided women with laughter in their eyes and children clinging to them.
The children were laughing, playing, swimming, and having a ball.
And then they were eating together...good stuff, like fruit and flatbread and hummus, and juice, and chicken and cheese.
No McDonald's.
No Burger King.
Later on, they gathered in a circle and we sat on the grass and on blankets, not thinking about the geese droppings all over the place...just being together to hear how this mural project came about.
I looked around at all the faces-fresh and clear, innocent, and full of vitality and wonder about everything that was going on around them and inside of them.
They spoke about a tree project they were concerned about.
They looked at pictures of some of the other murals, and they shared their wonder with each other, again, as if they were a family.
I loved talking with them.
I loved being among these children and their teachers who were teaching them about the real meaning of life.
The moment had arrived.
It was time for the children to unveil their mural-the one done in a rainstorm on Katarina's kitchen floor and through chicken pox and other traumas.
They scrambled to their feet and in an organized chaotic manner; they began to unroll the "Four Seasons" of the Catskills and their logo of the Woodstock Home School Network.
It was delightful and there in this wonderful broccoli tree surrounded park, I looked around at the 180 degree view of the mountains and their beauty, of the incredible clear summer sky and knew that someone above ordered a day like this and a place like this to be the stage and the gallery hall for this unveiling.
Like the other murals, it was stupendous.
I knew that it was the right thing to do, to drive all this way to meet the children whose work would jump off that canvas for all the world to see.
To know that somewhere in the middle of a lovely wooded spot of America, the kids and their teachers from a Home School were putting another meaning into "Home Sweet Home".
I thank them all for a memorable day.

Without Reservation __________________________________________________________________
by Joanne Tawfilis, October 2000
Without Reservation: The Other Side - Upon visiting the Abenaki Cultural Center
We had driven almost 60 miles into the Vermont hills looking for the small town where we had read about the Abenaki's.
Our hopes were to get the tribal children together and create another Native People's mural during my short visit to the area.
We finally saw the small sign outside the equally small buildings that was the tribal business and cultural office, parked the car and headed inside.
April St. Francis had a voice that could be heard a mile away.
She spoke with determination and anger intertwined like the ropes that could hold the sail lines of a ship in a storm and keep it from blowing itself over.
She kept an even temper but wanted to scream to the top of her lungs about the pain, the horror and the disrespect she had witnessed with her own eyes.
Instead, she wailed and paced in a manner that demanded one's attention and pulled at the heartstrings of anyone who could understand the white man's wanton disregard for America's first people.
As the daughter of a tribal chief, she, now acting chief, felt the heaviness of the responsibility that beckoned her to the role of leader, spokesperson, and champion for the rights of her tribe.
For the sake of each and every one of them, it was she who had to face off with those, who "without reservation" took the liberty of bulldozing through her ancestor's sacred burial grounds.
She had warned them before, years before, but to her dismay they forged ahead with their wantonness, leaving behind a trail of tears and controlled anger smothered in her chest.
The fight with the bureaucracies went nowhere.
Nothing changed.
Nothing new.
For hundreds of years, the same battle had been fought and lost for those who called themselves "Native Americans".
But what was she to do? It was not within her power to stop the reckless disregard for her ancestors-for their gravesites, for their descendents who could now only watch in disbelief and with broken hearts.
I am but a mere witness to what was happening after the fact.
As I walked into this room of tribute to the elders and looked upon the handfuls of bone and residue she valiantly tried to salvage from their destruction, I could feel the spirits and their souls gathered in silent harmony and songs of sorrow filling the entire hall where they lay.
My tears could not be suppressed and I let them swell into my throat as they burst through the walls of my heart.
For there before me, above April's hurt and angry wailing, I felt them too-these souls ripped from the earth-their fitful sleep caused by another kind of massacre, interrupted as violently as their deaths.
And so, "Without Reservation-the Other Side", I could only hold my breath and swallow my tears so as not to join her lonely and vigilant wail.
The mural would have to wait.
There was no way any living spirit could think of anything else for the moment or for the immediate future.
For how could anyone paint about peace and love and hope, when crying souls surrounded anyone with a heart? Yes, this mural would have to wait and when the children do create one, it is my hope it is a tribute to their elders and to those spirits who truly lived "without reservation".
