19 I. DESCR IPTION OF C REDIT IDENTITY THEFT
A .
Definition Credit identity theft occurs when someone (the "per petr ator ") wil lfull y acq uire s a co nsum er's personal identification information, s uch as the consumer's name, addre ss, Social Security number, date of bi rth, d river 's lice nse n umb er, m othe r's maiden name, or som e combination of these item s.
A consumer's Social Security number, along with t he consumer's name, are the keys to tapping into the consumer's credit identity.
The perpetrator also may acquire the consumer's credit or account information.
The perp etrator may use this informatio n unlawfu lly to obtain money, credit, goods, services, other t hings of value, and even medical information, in the

victim's name and without the victim's consent.
The perpetrato r also may use th is information to gain access to the victim's bank accounts.
The means by which the perpetrator o btains this information are discussed at B. below .
A consumer may not know that he or s he has been a victim of credit identity theft for some time after the fact.
The consumer often learns that he or she has been victimized after being refused an extension of credit.
Sometimes, the consumer learns that he or she has been victimized when a creditor or debt collec tor calls dema nding paym ent for deb ts incu rred by the perp etra tor.
T ypica lly, th e vic tim's credit standing is seriously damaged by the perpetrator, a nd the victim's credit report becomes filled with negative credit information as a result.
Consumers wh o are victims of credit identity theft have found it difficult to remove erro neous negative credit information from their credit reports and to reestablish their credit standing.
In t he past, some law e nforcement officials a nd credit reporting agencies did not c onsider the consumer to be the "victim" of cred it identity theft because the consumer's liability for credit card losses generally is limited by federal law to $50 for each card (see page 8).
They viewed the cre ditor or financial institution as the victim, although the consumer always has been the one who faces the emotional trauma a nd the often tedious task of removing erroneous i nformation fr om his or her credit repor t and re-estab lishing his or her credit standing.
The California Legislature enacted a la w, effective January 1, 1998, that created t he crime of "identity theft."3 As knowledge of this provision has spread, it has become more clear to all that the consumer is the victim of credit identity theft.
B .
How Credit Identity Theft Occurs Credit identity theft can occur in daily consumer transaction s in a variety of w ays.
For examp le:
approved credit offers and convenience checks from a consumer's mail box and use the information contained in them to ob tain credit in the consumer's name.
"Dumpster diving" Â­ If a business discards papers containing its customers' personal identification information (such as loan applications) without shred ding them, a "dumpster diver" may retrieve this information from the business' dumpster (trash c ontainer).
The thief th en may sell the in formation o r use it to obtain credit in the consumer's name.
Legislation effective in January 2001 may make it more difficu lt for dumpste r divers to obta in personal identification information.
After that date, businesses must destroy or arrange f or the destruction of custome r records tha t contain personal information when the records are no longer to be retained.4 A thief also may steal personal identification information at a consume r's home.
If a consumer discards documents containing personal identification information (such as preapproved credit offers) without destroying them, a thief may steal the information from the consumer's garbage can.
"Insider access" Â­ An employee of a business may wrongfully retrieve personal identification information that the business has collected for legitimate reasons, such as the consumer's Socia l Security num ber.
The e mployee the n may sell the informa tion to a crime ring or use it to obtain credit in the c onsumer's name.
"Imposter access" Â­ A thief ma y fraudulently obtain a consumer's credit report by posing as someone who has a legitimate nee d and righ t to the information in it, such as a landlord or employer.
Purse or wallet loss or snatching Â­ A thief may stea l, or t he co nsum er ma y lose , the con sume r's purse or wallet.
The thief then may use the consumer's stolen personal identification info rmat ion t o ob tain cred it in th e con sume r's name.
Mail theft Â­ If a consumer leaves his or her credit card payment e nvelope in the mail box for the postal carrier to pick up, a t hief may steal the envelope.
The thief then may use the information from the credit card statement and the consumer's check to obtain c redit in t he consumer's name.
A thief also may steal pre-2-
Computerized information services Â­ Businesses called "information brokers" sort, package and
sell persona l identification information in electronic form.
Some businesses may not safeguard this information adequately, or may sell it to purchasers that t he business has not appropriately screened.
T he purchaser or thief then may use the informatio n to obtain c redit in the names of the c onsumers to whom the information relates.
C .
Example of Credit I dentity Theft: One Victim's Experience A Consum er Repor ts article describes a typical case of credit identity theft as reported by the victim:6 An employee of a medical office where the victim received services obtained the victim's n ame and Social Security number from the victim 's medical file.
W ith this information , the thief alleg edly was able to obtain lines of credit in the victim's name worth $10 ,000, rent a n apartmen t, obtain utility service, and earn income in the victi m's na me.
P rior t o thi s, the victi m's credit report was "spotless."
The victim first learned that she was the victim of credit identity theft when she began receiving teleph one calls from lenders and collection agencies demanding payment of numerous past-due credit accounts that she had not opened.
A s reported by the victim, her bank refused to refinance her home mor tgage bec ause she w as a bad cre dit risk, and the Internal Revenue Service claimed that she owed taxes on income that the thief appare ntly had earned.
It took the victim t wo years to have the negative credit information caused by the thief's activities rem oved from h er credit report.
The victim reported that during th is time , the thief con tinu ed to use t he vi ctim 's name, and creditors c ontinued to press her for payment.
II.
HOW TO PROTECT A GAINST CREDIT IDENTITY THEFT It is impossible fo r a consum er to preven t all distribution of his or her pers onal identification and credit information, or to exercise meaningful control over all of the possible uses of that info rmation.
Nonetheless, a consumer can take steps to reduce the risk of theft a nd misuse of his or her personal identification and credit information.
For e xample:
Internet Â­ Personal identification information that is available on the Internet can be intercepted or accesse d by a thief and misused to obtain credit in the victim's name.
Having obtained the c onsumer's personal identification information, the perpetrator then may app ly for a new drive r's lic ense in th e con sume r's name, order new credit cards in the c onsumer's name to be sent to the perpetrator's address, obtain a copy of the consumer's credit report, and otherwise assume the con sumer's c redit ide ntity.
Neglect by some retailers and creditors may contribute to a perpetrator' s successful use of the victim's credit identity.
For example, some retailers may not carefully check photographs and signatures on identification given by perpetrators in check and credit card transactions.
When perpetrators apply for new cred it, some cred itors may not ch eck to see if the date of b irth or mothe r's maiden nam e is correct, or if the driver's license is valid.
Sometimes, a creditor may ignore a recent change of address, which can be an indication of identity theft (because a perpetrator often diverts the victim's mail to a n address used by the perp etrator).
Legislation effective January 1, 2002, addresses some aspects of this problem.
If the address a consumer gives when requesting or being offered cred it do es no t matc h the add ress in th e con sume r's credit report, the retailer or other creditor must take steps to verify the consumer's address an d confirm that the cred it transaction is not the resu lt of identity theft.
If a credit report clearly shows that information has been b locked as th e result of ide ntity theft (see page 7), the user of the credit report must take steps to verify the consumer's identity a nd confirm that the transaction is not t he result of identity theft before it extends credit or lends money.

Always t ake credit card, d eb it card and ATM receipts with you.
Never th row them in a public trash container.
Tear them up or shred t hem at home when you no longer need them.
Do not leave bill payment envelopes at your mailbox fo r the postal ca rrier to pick u p. Install a lock on your mailbox if you live in an area where mail theft has occurred.
Tear up o r shred unu sed pre-app roved cred it card solicitations and convenience checks.
Carefully review your credit card statements and utility bills (including cellular telephone bills) for unauthorized use as soon as you receive them.
If you suspect unauthorized use, contact the provider's customer service and fraud depart ments im mediate ly.
If a business re quests your S ocial Secu rity number, ask to use an alternate number.
Some businesses have systems that do not use Socia l Security num bers to iden tify their customers.
If the business doe s not have such a n alternate system, ask to use an alternate identifier that you will remember (for example, a combination of the letters of your last name a nd numbers).
You can lawfully refuse to give a private business your Social Security number, but the business then can refuse to provide you service.
New legislation addresses several problem uses of So cial Security n umbers by p rivate businesse s, such as p rinting Soc ial Security numbers on cards needed to access the business' pro ducts or ser vices, intentio nally making S ocial Secu rity numbers a vailable to the genera l public, and other uses.
A busi ness that uses your Social Security number in a prohibited manner after July 1, 2002 must notify you that you may stop it from using your Social Security number in t hat manner by sending it a written request.
The business must comply within 30 days, and cannot c harge you a fee to i mplement your request or d eny you service s because of it.

State and local agenc ies are not subject to this new l aw.
Order your credit report each year from each of the three major credit reporting agencies (see the List of Resou rces, page 14).
Chec k each cre dit report carefully for accuracy a nd for indications of fraud, such as credit accounts that you did not open; a pplications f or credit t hat you did not authorize; credit inquiries that you did not initiate;7 charges that you did not incur; and defaults and deli nquencies that you did not cause.
Check t he i dentifying information in your credit repor t to be sure it is ac curate (esp ecially your name, a ddress, an d Social S ecurity number).
Never give out your credit card, bank account or Social Security number over the telephone unless you placed the call and you have a trusted business relationship with the business or organization.

If a government a gency asks for your Social Security number, a Privacy Act notice should ac company th e request.
10 This notice will explain w hether your S ocial Secu rity number is required or merely requested; the use that will b e made of yo ur Social S ecurity number; and what will happen if you refuse to provide it.
If you do not receive your credit card statement on time (or if you do not receive a new o r renewed credit card when you expect it), your mail may have b een stolen.
It also is possible that an identity thief has filed a c hange of
address request in your name with the creditor or the post office.
Identity thieves do this to divert their victims' mail to the thief's address.
~ Call the creditor to see if a change of address request has been filed in your name, or if additional or replacement credit cards have be en requ ested o n your ac count.
If either has happened, i nform the creditor that you did not make the request and instruct the creditor not to honor it.
Call the post office to see if a change of address request has b een filed in your name.
If this has happened, immediately notify the Postal Inspector (see List of Resources, page 15, under "U.S .
Post Office").

You can request that your credit information not be used for these purposes.12 Doing this will limit the numb er of pre-app roved cred it offers that you receive.

If you shop on the Internet, use a cred it card rather than a debit card, a nd shop o nly with reputable companies that you know.
One Internet expert recommends t hat you use a single, distinct, credit card with a low limit when you shop online.
Make sure that you are using a secure browser that co mplies with industry security standards, such as Secure Sockets Laye r (SSL), before you provide any sensitive personal information.
These standards help e nsure the security o f your transaction by encrypting or scrambling the purchase information (including your credit card number) that you send over the Internet.
Look for symbols of a n unbroken lock or key at the bottom of your brow ser window, a Web address that includes an "s" (for example, "https://), or the words "Secure Sockets La yer (SSL)" in the browser's and merchant's privacy statements.
Alternatively, you can place your order by telephone or ma il. Never send payment information by e-mail.

Consider not listing your residence telephone number in the telephone book, or consider listing your name and residence telephone number without a n address.
If you decide to list your name a nd telephone number, c onsider not l isting your professional qualification or affiliation (for example, "Dr.," "Atty.," or "Ph.D .").
Make a list o f, or photoc opy, all of your c redit and debit cards.
For each card, include the account number, expiration date, credit limit a nd the telephone numbers of customer service and fraud departments.
Keep this list in a safe place (not your wallet or purse) so that you can contact each issuer quickly if your cards are lost or stolen.
Make a similar list for your bank accounts.
Check your Social Security Earnings and Benefits statement each year to make sure that someone else is not usin g your Soc ial Security number fo r employmen t.

Each case of credit identity theft involves unique facts and circumstances, and other than repor ting the crime to the police , one victim w ill not necessarily take the same step s as other victims.
If your credit ide ntity has been stolen, you sh ould review all of the following tips a nd choose those that are appropriate to your situation.
A .
Law Enforcement Report the crime to the po lice immediately.
California Penal Code s ection 530.5 classifies identity theft as a crime Â­ either a misdemean or or a felony.
14 You can initiate a law enforcement investigation by contacting the local law e nforcement agency having jurisdiction over your a ddress.
The a gency must take a police re port, give you a copy of it, a nd begin an i nvestigation.15 If the crime was committed in a different jurisdiction, the a gency may refer the matter to a law e nforcement agency where the crime was committed for investigation.
Some law enforcement agencies charge for copies of the police report.
The laws on identity theft neither permit nor prohibit this practice.
Beginning January 1, 2002, a D epartment of Motor Vehicles investigator with peace officer status can take an investigative re port which you can use to block reporting of inform ation in your credit report (see page 7).
16 Give the police or DMV investigator as much information and doc umentation as you can.
Creditors, banks, credit reporting agencies and insurance companies may require you to provide a police report to verify that you are a victim of the crime of iden tity theft.
Shield the keypad when punching in your PIN at an ATM or when placing a ca lling card call.
This helps protect against "shoulder surfers" learning your code.
Install a lock on your mailbox at home, or use a post office b ox.
This w ill reduce the risk of mail theft.
When you order new checks, pick them up at the bank instead of having them mailed to your home.
When you fill out a loan or credit application, be sure that the business either shreds these applications or stores them in lock ed files.
These applications often contain a ll of the information that a dumpster diver or an unscrupulous em ployee needs to assume your credit id entity.
If you have a good reason to believe that you are the target of a n identity thief, consider placing a security alert or s ecurity freeze on your cred it report (see page 7).
You also can reque st that a victim's statement b e placed in your credit file (see page 7).

WHAT T O DO IF YO U ARE A VICTIM OF CREDIT IDENTITY THEFT Anyone can beco me a victim of c redit identity theft.
You must act quickly upon discovering that you are the victim of credit identity theft.

If necessary, show this Legal Guide and the text of sections 530.5-530.8 to law enforcement officials when you request a police report and an investigation.
B .
Credit Reporting Agencies Call the frau d units of the three major c redit reporting agencies (see the List of Resources, page 14).
Inform each credit reporting agency of the theft of your credit cards, account numbers or identifying information.
Â· You can request that a victim's statement be added to your credit r eport Â­ for example: " My identification has been u sed to app ly for credit fraudulently.
Call me at ________ to verify a ny application for credit."
The credit reporting agency will re quire you to ve rify your identity (for example, by submitting your ph one bill).
Beginning July 1, 2002, you can call or write the credit repor ting agenc ies to reque st that a "security alert" be placed in your credit reports.
The security a lert notifies recipients of your credit report that your identity may have been used fraud ulently to obta in goods o r services in your name.
T he security ale rt will remain in effect for at least 90 days, and you may request that it be renewed.17 Beginning January 1, 2003, you can request a free cop y of your credit report at the time that the 90-day alert period expires.18 Beginning January 1, 2003, you can place a "security freeze" on your credit reports by sending written requests by certified mail to each of the credit re porting ag encies.
A security freeze prev ents the cred it reporting ag encies, in most instances, from releasing you r credit report or information in it without your prior express authorizatio n.
The cre dit reporting agency will provide you a unique personal identifier that you can use to temporarily lift the security freeze.
Otherwise, the freeze remains effective until you request that it be removed.
Credit reporting agencies c annot cha rge a fee for th ese services if you are a victim of identity theft an d submit a -7-
valid police report or DM V investigative report.
19 C .
Credit Rep orts Request a copy of your credit report from each credit reporting agency.
The credit reporting agency must give you a free copy of your credit report if you have been denied cre dit. 20 If you certify to the cr edit reporting agency in writing that you believe that your file contains inaccurate information due to fraud, t he credit reporti ng agency must give you a free copy of your credit rep ort. 21 In other circumstances, each credit reporti ng agency can c harge you $8.00 for your credit rep ort. 22 Check each credit report carefully when you receive it.
Look for accounts that you have not applied f or or opened; c harges that you have not incurred; inquiries that you have not initiated; and defaults and delinque ncies that you have not caus ed. Check your identifying information carefully Â­ especially your name, add ress and S ocial Secu rity number.
The report will list all variations of your Social Security number and other identifying information re ported t o the credit reporting agency by creditors and other users of your credit reports.
Send each credit reporting agency a written request to re move all info rmation that a ppears in your credit report as a result of the theft of your person al identi fication and cre dit infor mation .
It may take some time to have all of this erroneous information removed fro m each of yo ur credit reports.
Ask each credit reporting agency to send you a copy of your corrected credit report.
When you receive your corrected credit reports, check to see that all of the erroneous information has been removed from each re port, and that each repo rt contains a s ecurity alert or a v ictim's statement, if you reques ted one.
It's a goo d idea to sen d a letter to each credit reporting agency e very two-three months explaining that you are the victim of credit id entity theft and asking that you be provided a free copy of your credit report.
This will enable you to c heck your credit reports for new erroneous information, a nd for previously-deleted erroneous i nformation that may have reappeared.
Â· Credit reporting agencies must block reporting of any information that a victim of identity theft
Â·
Â·
alleges appears in his or her credit report as a result of the crime of identity theft.
The victim must su bmit to th e credit reportin g agen cy a copy o f a valid police report or D MV investigative report filed under Penal Code section 530.6 (see pa ges 6, 19).
23 Â· Credit reporting agencies must delete from your credit repor t those inqu iries based o n credit requests that the agency verifies were initiated a s a result of ide ntity theft.
24 D .
Credit Card Issuers Call each of your credit card issu ers to report that you are the victim of credit identity theft.
Ask each credit card issuer to cancel your card a nd provide a replacement card with a new account number.
Ask that a password be required before a ny inquiries or changes ca n be made on the a ccount.
Immediately f ollow up each telephone call with a letter that confirms the conversation and the action the credit card issuer has agreed to take.
Send the letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, and keep a copy.
Ask each credit card issuer about t he status of your account.
Ask if the card issuer has received a change of address request, or a request for a dditional or replacement credit cards.
If you have not filed a change of address request or requested additional credit cards, instruct the card issuer not to honor these requests.
Â· Credit card issuers who receive a notice of change of the cardholder's billing address, and within 10 days also receive a request for additional credit cards, must verify the change of address before activating additional cards or issuing additional cards to the n ew address.
Also, card issuers must verify addresses on accepted credit card s olicitations or applications that differ from the address in the solicitation or application.25 A consumer's liability for unauthorized use of a credit card cannot be more than $50.26 The consumer must notify the credit card issuer promptly upon learning o f the unauthorized use .
Most creditors will waive (forgive) the $50 if the consu mer not ifies the credito r within two days after learning of the unauthorized use.
Also call (and then write) each c re dit card issuer or creditor that has opened a new account that you did not auth orize or app ly for.
These a ccounts probably will be listed in your credit reports, along with the cred itor's or issuer's add ress, and of ten, its customer service number.
Explain that you are the victim of credit identity theft and that you did not open the a ccount, an d ask each issuer and c reditor to close the account imme diately.
Some credit card issuers and creditors ma y ask you to sign an affidavit or to submit a copy of the police rep ort on the theft of your personal identification information.
Some issuers and creditors may accept the Federal Trade Commission's ID Theft Affidavit (see page 12).
Ask each issue r and credito r to inform ea ch credit reporting agency that the account was opened fraudulen tly and has be en closed a t your reques t. E .
Financial Institutions If your bank account inform ation or checks have been stolen, or if a fraudulent bank account has been opened using your identification information, i mme diately notify the bank and the check verification companies listed in the List of Res ources on page 16.
Do this both by telephon e and in writing.
Â· Â· Close your c hecking and savings accounts and open new acco unts with new acco unt numbers.
Report lost or stolen ATM a nd debit cards immed iately by calling the financial institution.
Then send a follow -up letter by certified mail.
It's important to act immediately because a thief with your car d and PIN can drain yo ur accoun t, and because your lia bility for loss depends on how quickly you re port that your card has been lost or stolen (described in note 2 7, page 17).

Driver's License/California ID Card The Ca lifornia driver's lice nse and C alifornia identification card are primary identification documents in Ca lifornia.
Therefore, they often are targets for identity thieves.
If you have lost your driver's license or California identification card, or if you suspect that someo ne may b e using your driv er's licens e or ID card number, immediately call your local Department of Motor Vehicles office for an a ppointment (listed under "State Government" in the white pages of t he telephone directory) or call the DMV's toll free fraud hotline num ber, (866) 6 58-5758 .
It is possible to obtain a new driver's license or ID card number under limited circumstan ces (describ ed in endn ote 28, page 17).

Social Security number If you can prove that you are being disadvan taged bec ause som eone use d your So cial Security number, it is possible, in e xtreme cases, to obtain a new Social Sec urity number.
29 In order to obtai n a new So cial Security number, your situatio n must fit the Social Security Administration's criteria for issuing a second Social Security number.
See endnote 30 (page 18) for a general overview of these criteria.30 If you suspect that someone else is using your Social Security number for employment purposes, request a copy of your Social Security Earnings a nd Benefits statement.
(The Social Security Adminis tration now mails these s tatements a nnually to a ll eligible workers who are 25 and older.)
If the statement c onfirms this use of you r Social Se curity number, contact the Social Security Administration immediately.
(To order your statement, or to contact the Social Security Administration, see the List of Resources, pag e 15.)
A merchant may refuse to take your check on the advice of a check verification company (because the thief has written bad checks in your name).
The merchant w ill refer you to on e of the che ck verifi cation companies in the List of Resources on page 16.
Call the check verific ation comp any and ex plain the situation.
You can ask the che ck verification company to notify retailers using its database not t o accept checks from your o ld account.
Some banks w ill take the initiative to notify the c heck verification company it does busine ss with that your checks have been stolen or that a fraudulent bank account has been opened in your name.
Â· If you cannot open a checking account because of the t hief's activities, call Chex-Systems (see the List of Resources, pag e 16).
Be prepared for banks and credit grantors to ask you to fill out fraud affidavits to be notarized or signed un der penalty o f perjury.

For e xample: Â· The victim m ay notify a credito r that he or sh e is the victim of credit identity theft, and may provide the creditor appropriate documentation, but the cred itor continu es to report d ebts incurred by the thief to the credit reporting agencies; or The victim may provide a credit reporting agency appropriate documentation and request the credit re porting agency to remove i nforma tion from the victim's credit report that appears due to the th eft of the victim's pe rsonal iden tifi cation and credit inform ation, but the credit reporting agency does not remove the erroneous information from the victim's credit report.
If you suspect that an identity thief has stolen your mail or ha s filed a chan ge of addr ess reques t in your name, notify the Postal Inspector (see the List of Resources, pag e 15, under "U .S. Post Office").
J. Passport
If you have a passport, notify the passport office that the identity thief may apply for a new passp ort (see the List of Resources, page 15, under "U.S. Post Office").
K .
Erroneous Civil or Criminal J udgment The action s of an iden tity thief sometime s result in civil or criminal judgments being entered against the victim.
If you are a victim of identity t heft, and have had an erroneous civil or criminal judgment entered a gainst you, you should consult an attorney about vaca ting the judg ment.
A victim of identity theft whose identity was used by the th ief to commit a nother crim e can seek to have his or h er record cle ared und er certain circumstan ces.
If an iden tity thief has willfu lly obtained another pers on's personal identification information without that person's authorization, has used t hat information to c ommit a crime in a ddition to the crime of identity theft, and is convicted of that additional crime, the court records must reflect that the person whose ide ntity was falsely us ed to comm it the crime did not commit the crime.31 Effective Ja nuary 1, 200 1, a victim of ide ntity theft can petition a court for a determination of factual innocence (1) where the perpetrator of t he identity theft was arrested f or or convicted of a crime under the victim's identity or (2) where the victim's identity mistakenly has been associated with a record of criminal co nviction.
(Th is court proc edure is described at endno te 32, page 18.)
32 Once you have obtained such a court order, you can a pply to register with the California Attorn ey General's ID Theft Database (see page 12), if you wish.
L .
Uncoo perative Credito r or Cre dit Reporting Agency Occasionally, a victim of credit identity theft may encounter a creditor or credit reporting agency that unreas onably doe s not coop erate with the victim as the victim se eks to restore his or her cre dit -10-
Â·
Hopefully, the requirement that local law enforcem ent agenc ies must take police repo rts will make it easier for victims of identity theft to use police reports as one means of convincing an uncooperative creditor or credit reporting agency t hat the victim's i dentity has been stolen, and that the victim is not resp onsible for th e charges or credit information at issue.
Also, as described under the preceding heading, a victim whose identity has been used or associated with a crime can seek a j udicial determination of factual innocence of the crime, which may help whe n dealing with an unc ooperative credito r or cred it report ing age ncy. 33 The credit reporting laws also may offer some help to a victim faced with a n uncooperative credit or or credit rep orting agen cy: Â· A creditor who prov ides informa tion to a cred it reporting agency regarding its transactions a nd experiences with c onsumers is called a "furnisher" of information.
If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the c onsumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information that the furnisher has provided to a credit reporti ng agency, the furnisher must include a notice that the information is disputed if it provides the informa tion to a credit re porting agenc y.34 A furnisher is prohibited from providing information to a credit reporting agency on a specific transaction if the furnisher knows, or should kn ow, that the information is incomplete or inaccurate.35 If the furnisher determines that reported information is incomplete or inaccurate,
Â·
it must promptly notify the credit reporting agency of its d etermination, a nd must provide the agency c orrections to make the information complete and accurate.
Thereafter, the furnisher cannot provide the credit reporting agency a ny of t he i nformati on that remains i ncomplete or inaccurate.36 To invoke these protections, the victim should send the furnisher a letter that clearly explains and documents why t he reported information is incomplete or inaccurate.
The letter should be sent to the address specified by the furnisher for this purpose.
If you are a victim o f credit identity th eft, and if you believe that a creditor or a credit reporting agency unreasona bly or carelessly continues to report erroneous information that is the result of the theft of your personal identification and credit information, consider seeking assistan ce from an attorney.
M .
Demands to Pay Debts Caused b y the Credit Identity Thief Since the victim of credit identity theft did not incur the de bts caused by the thief, the v ictim ordinarily will have a complete defense to the collector's demand for payment of those debts.
The victim ordina rily should no t pay any debt w hich is the result of t he theft.
If a debt collector demands that the victim p ay such a de bt, the victim sh ould explain why he or she does not owe the debt.
The victim should dispute the d ebt in a follow -up letter to the debt collector, which also should include the victim's e xplanation why h e or s he does not owe the debt and a copy of the victim's police or D MV report or ID Theft Affidavit (see p age 12).
37 The victim should send the letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, and keep a copy of the letter and enclosures.
In an effort to convince the debt collector that the victim did not incur the debt, the victim may decide to provide personal identification information to the collector.
For example, the debt collector may requ est th e vic tim's S ocia l Sec urity num ber, drive r's license number and addresses for the last several years.
Disclosing some or all of this information entails a loss of privacy, which the victim must balance against the possible benefit of c onvincing the debt collector that the victim did not incur the debt.
The victim should keep t he originals of a ny documents provide d to the debt collector.
-11-
The victim may find it helpful to c onsult an attorney if the vic tim receives d emands to pay debts caused by the identity thief.
The victim should consult an attorney if the victim receives notice o f a legal action based on d ebts incurred by the thief.
(See the List of Resource s, page 14.)
As a practical matter, the victim s hould contact the original creditor to e xplain why he or she does not owe t he debt, and as k the creditor to i nform the debt c ollector that the victim is not responsible for the debt.
The victim should send the creditor a follow-up letter, including the victim's police or DMV report or ID Theft Aff idavit, by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The victim s hould keep a copy of the letter and enclosures.
See Legal G uide DC -4, "Check list for Identity Theft Victims Who are Contacted by a Debt Collector," for steps a victim should take when the victim learns of the theft of his or her identity a nd when the victim is first contacted by a deb t collector.
(See the List of Resource s, page 13.)
Two new laws may help protect victims of identity theft from being pursued b y debt collectors and creditors for claims incurred by the identity thief.
Beginning January 1, 2002: Â· A creditor cannot sell a consumer's debt to an outside de bt collector if (1) that particula r debt is blocked in the c onsumer's credit report (see page 7), or (2) t he c onsumer has provided the creditor sufficient written information to s how that the consumer is not obligated on the claim because the consu mer is the victim o f identity theft.
38 A victim of id entity theft can file a lawsuit against a pe rson who purports to h ave a claim for money (o r an interest in p roperty) in connection with a transaction procured by identity theft.
If the claimant has already filed suit against t he victim, the victim can file a cross-comp laint against th e claimant.
T he victim must prove th at he or she is the victim of ide ntity theft as to the p articular claim .
If the victim proves this, the court can a ward the victim a broad range of relief as appropriate to the case, including a declaration, injunction, dismissal of the claimant's claim, damages, and costs and attorneys fees.39 In order to recover damages or attorneys fees,
Â·
the victim must have sent the claimant, at least 30 days before the victim files his or her action, a written notice explaining that the victim is a victim of identity th eft.
This no tice should include a c opy of the victim's police report or DMV investigative report.
If the victim files a cross complaint, this notice can be part of the cross comp laint.
40 This new law also provides for award of a substantial civil penalty against the claimant in limited circumstances.41 N .

Attorney General's ID Theft D atabase
Beginning January 1, 2002, many kinds of lenders, creditors, financial institutions and utilities must provide you (or a law enforcement officer specified by you) copies of application forms and application information containing identifying information submitted in your name by the identity thief.
In some instances, you may be able to obtain a record of transactions or charges a ssociated w ith the loan o r account.
Your request must be accompanied by a polic e report issued under P enal Code section 530.6 and proper identifying inform ation.
Credit card issuers, most financial institutions and finance lenders must provide you copies without charge.42 2.
Federal Trade Commission ID Theft Affidavit and Database The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has created an ID Theft Affidavit that victims can use to notify some companies where new accounts were op ened in the victim's name.
Using this form allows the victim to complete a single, standard f orm to submit to the companies that have agreed to accept it.
These companies will use the in formation th at the victim sub mits to i nvestigate and decide the victim's claim.
The Affidavit form a nd instructions for c ompleting and using it are available at ww w.consumer.go v/ idtheft/ affidavit, or through the FTC's Web site, www.ftc.gov.

The California Attorney General's office has created an Identity Theft D atabase to h elp victims of identity theft who have been wrongfully accused of, or associated with, crimes.43 Beginning September 1, 2001, if you have been charged with a crime committed by another pe rson using your stolen ide ntity, or if your identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, you can apply to register your name with this database.
In order to apply to the database, you must first obtain a c ourt order verifying that you are the victim of identity theft (see page 10).
Once you r information has been c onfirmed, it is entered into the databa se and can be used to show oth ers that you w ere not actu ally responsible for the crime.
In addition, your information is s ubmitted to the Automated Criminal History System, identifying you as a victim of identity theft, and directing law enforcem ent and crim inal justice ag encies to contact the Attorney General's office for further information concerning your registration.
