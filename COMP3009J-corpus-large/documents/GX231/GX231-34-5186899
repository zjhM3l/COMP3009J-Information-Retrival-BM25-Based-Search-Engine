(3)
The part of the Intracoastal Waterway described here is the toll-free "canal" which affords continuous protected passage behind the Atlantic Coast and the Florida Keys for more than 1,243 statute miles between Norfolk, VA, and Key West, FL Route 1, the basic route, follows Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal to Albemarle Sound; Route 2, the alternate route, is through Great Dismal Swamp Canal to the sound.
Also described in this chapter is the Okeechobee Waterway, which junctions with the Intracoastal Waterway in St. Lucie Inlet.
The Intracoastal Waterway is used by commercial light-draft vessels and tows unable to navigate long stretches in the open ocean, and by pleasure craft.
Small-boat and recreation facilities are found along the waterway.
Supervision of the waterway's construction, maintenance, and operation is divided among five U.S. Army Engineer Districts (Norfolk, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, and Jacksonville) whose district-office addresses are listed in the appendix.

through Hawk Channel to Key West.
The channel has a controlling depth of about 5 feet and is exposed to winds from the northwest.
(See Local Notice to Mariners and latest editions of charts for controlling depths of the Intracoastal Waterway.)
The alternate route of the Intracoastal Waterway through the Great Dismal Swamp Canal and the Okeechobee Waterway is described later in this chapter.

Mileage The Intracoastal Waterway (I.W.) mileage is zeroed in 36Â°50.9'N., 76Â°17.9'W., off the foot of West Main Street, Norfolk, VA, and progresses southward to I.W. Mile 1243.8 at Key West, FL, in 24Â°33.7'N., 81Â°48.5'W.
Distances along the Intracoastal Waterway are in statute miles to facilitate reference to the small-craft charts; all other distances are nautical miles.
Mileage conversion tables are on page TÂ­29.
Channels The Federal project for the Intracoastal Waterway via Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal provides for a least depth of 12 feet from Norfolk, VA, (I.W. Mile 0.0) to Fort Pierce, FL, (I.W. Mile 965.6), thence 10 feet to Miami, FL, (I.W. Mile 1089.0), and thence 7 feet to Key West, FL, (I.W. Mile 1243.8).
The Miami to Key West section of the waterway has been completed only as far as Cross Bank (I.W. Mile 1152.5); the remainder has been deferred for restudy.
Although no work has been performed on this section of the waterway, a channel, marked in accordance with I.W. markings, leads from Cross Bank to Big Pine Key along the northwesterly side of the Florida Keys.
At Big Pine Key, the waterway bifurcates going north through Florida Bay or south
Bridges The minimum overhead clearance of fixed bridges over the Intracoastal Waterway is 56 feet at the Julia Tuttle Causeway at Miami, Mile 1087.1.
General drawbridge regulations and opening signals for bridges over the Intracoastal Waterway are given in 117.1 through 117.49, chapter 2.
Special drawbridge regulations for certain bridges that supplement the general regulations are referenced with the area description of the waterway.
As a public service and to assist in the management and safety of the Intracoastal Waterway, VHF-FM channels 13 and 16 are monitored at some of the bridges.
Overhead cables The minimum clearance of overhead cables crossing the Intracoastal Waterway is 68 feet in Snows Cut, Mile 295.8.
An overhead cable car at Mile 356.4 has a least clearance of 67 feet under the low point of travel of the cabin.
Caution When running with a fair tide or in windy weather, exercise caution when approaching and passing bridges and sharp turns.
Many of the overhead cables over the waterway carry high voltage, and a margin of safety should be allowed when weather is unfavorable.
Locks Great Bridge Lock (mile 11.5) is the only lock on the Intracoastal Waterway between Norfolk and Key West via Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal.
It is 600 feet long (530 usable), 75 feet wide (72 feet usable), 16 feet over the sills, and has a lift of 2.7 feet.
(See 207.160, chapter 2, for regulations governing use, administra tion, and navigation of locks and floodgates.)

Cable ferries Cable ferries are guided by cables fastened to shore and sometimes propelled by a cable rig attached to the shore.
Generally, the cables are suspended during crossings and dropped to the bottom when the ferries dock.
Where specific operating procedures are known they are mentioned in the text.
Since operating proce dures vary, mariners are advised to exercise extreme caution and seek local knowledge.
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PASS A MOVING CABLE FERRY.
Aids to navigation Intracoastal Waterway aids have characteristic yel low markings which distinguish them from aids to nav igation marking other waters.
(See U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists or Chart 1 (Nautical Chart Symbols and Ab breviations) for illustrations of special markings.)
Lights and daybeacons should not be passed close aboard because those marking dredged channels are usually placed back from the bottom edge of the chan nel and others may have rip-rap mounds around them to protect the structures.
Charts Navigation of the Intracoastal Waterway can be made easier by use of the special small-craft series which the National Ocean Service publishes.
Tides Under ordinary conditions the in the waterway is from nontidal many sections, the tide depends on tion of the wind.
Severe hurricanes ter surface 10 feet or more above localities.
severe weather does strike, shelter is usually close by, either up a protected river or at a nearby port.
However, navigation becomes more critical in many restricted reaches along this route, so that weather, as well as tides and currents, is important.
The waterway is cov ered by a network of National Weather Service VHF-FM radio stations that provide continuously updated forecasts and warnings.
Also Coastal Warning Display sig nals are located at various places along the Intracoastal Waterway and connecting channels.
The Marine Weather Services Charts published by the National Weather Service show the locations of both the radio stations and warning displays, while display locations are also listed on the NOS charts.

Small-craft facilities There are many small-craft facilities along the Intracoastal Waterway.
For isolated places and small cities, this chapter describes the more important of these facilities; for large recreational areas, where indi vidual facilities are too numerous to mention, the information given is more general.
Additional information may be obtained from the series of small-craft charts published for the many places, and from various local small-craft guides.
COLREGS Demarcation Lines The lines established for Chesapeake Bay and the rivers, sounds, and inlets of the coasts of Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida are described in 80.510 through 80.735 and 80.740, chap ter 2.

Cross currents Where two streams cross, the current will have a greater velocity in the deeper channel.
This is noticeable along the Intracoastal Waterway where it follows a dredged canal cutting across a winding stream.
Cross currents will also be noticed where either an inlet from the ocean or a drainage canal enters the waterway.
Weather The Intracoastal Waterway affords protection from the winds and waves of the offshore Atlantic.
Land cre ates friction that reduces windspeeds by as much as 30 percent of those over the open sea.
Wave heights are re duced by shallow depths and limited fetch.

Winds blow most frequently from the southwest, except in the fall when northeasterlies prevail.
Gales are rare and winds of 17 knots or more occur only 2 to 3 percent of the time from October through April.
Visi bilities are worst from September through January, when they drop below 0.5 mile (0.9 km) on an average of 3 to 5 mornings per month; by noon this type of fog has generally lifted.
Precipitation averages nearly 47 inches (1,193.8 mm) each year and is most frequent during the sum mer, particularly as brief heavy showers or thunderstorms.
July is the wettest month averaging about 6.5 inches (165.1 mm) of rainfall while October is the dri est month averaging about 2.5 inches (63.5 mm).
About 3 to 4 inches (76.2 to 101.6 mm) of snow falls each winter.
Snow has fallen in each month, November through April.
The greatest 24-hour snowfall occurred on February 26, 1963 when 6.2 inches (157.5 mm) ac cumulated.
Complete supply and repair facilities, restaurants, and hotel and motel accommodations are available at Elizabeth City.

From the vicinity of the light at the entrance to North River, Route 1 continues across Albemarle Sound for 12.7 miles to the light at the entrance to Alli gator River, where alternate Route 2, via the Great Dis mal Swamp Canal rejoins the basic route.
The passage across the sound to Alligator River is marked by lights.
In heavy weather the passage is uncomfortable and even dangerous for open boats.
The rise and fall of the water level in Albemarle Sound depends on the wind.
Alligator River extends in a southerly direction for about 20 miles, then turns west and narrows.
The channel of the Intracoastal Waterway has been dredged the entire length of the wider part of the river and for about 4 miles through its western reach to the land cut connecting with Pungo River.
The channel is well marked by lights and daybeacons.

Weather, Daytona Beach and vicinity The nearness to the ocean results in a climate tem pered by winds off the water.
Summer temperatures, which reach 90Â°F (32.2Â°C) or more on an average of 55 days each year, are often cooled below 90Â°F (32.2Â°C) by an early afternoon sea breeze.
The average high tem perature for Daytona Beach is 80Â°F (26.7Â°C) and the av erage low temperature is 61Â°F (161.1Â°C).
By a fraction of a degree, July is the warmest month with an average high of 90Â°F (32.2Â°C) and an average low of 72Â°F (22.2Â°C).
January is the coolest month with an average high of 69Â°F (20.6Â°C) and an average low of 47Â°F (8.3Â°C).
Temperatures of 100Â°F (37.8Â°C) have been recorded in each month, May through August.
The ex treme maximum temperature for Daytona Beach is 102Â°F (38.9Â°C) recorded in July 1981.
Freezing tem peratures are uncommon with an average of only two days each year recording an extreme minimum below
(280)
32Â°F (0Â°C) and only 11 days recording an extreme min imum below 45Â°F (7.2Â°C).
The coolest temperature on record at Daytona Beach is 15Â°F (-9.4Â°C) recorded in January 1985.
Frequent afternoon showers and thunderstorms (13-18 days per month) also help cool things off in ad dition to accounting for about 60 percent of the annual precipitation from June through mid-October.
Average annual rainfall at Daytona Beach is 49 inches (1,244.6 mm).
August is the wettest month averaging nearly 6.5 inches (165.1 mm) and December is the driest month averaging about 2.5 inches (63.5 mm).
Snowfall is rare and an accumulation has never occurred however, trace amounts have been recorded in each month, De cember through February.
Heavy fog is most likely dur ing winter and early spring.
These radiation fogs usually form at night and dissipate after sunrise.
On rare occasions, a sea fog moves in and persists for 2 or 3 days.
While tropical cyclones are a threat mainly from June through October, hurricane force winds can be expected once in 30 years on the average.
At this lati tude and location, hurricanes usually either pass well offshore or have weakened from an overland trip from the southwest or west.
Of the 59 tropical cyclones that threatened Daytona Beach during the period 1842-1995, 47 occurred during the months August, September, and October.
By a narrow margin, the greatest occurrence is in September.
The predominate direction from which the storm arrives is from the South or Southwest.
Since 1950, 22 storms have come within 50 nm (92.6 km) of Daytona Beach.
Hurricane Donna is likely the most memorable storm to effect the Daytona Beach area in recent memory.
On September 11, 1969, Donna crossed the central Keys moving to the northwest and abruptly turned northward crossing the southwest Florida coast near Naples.
From there, Donna continued north-northeastward, up the spine of the peninsula, moving back out over open water north of Daytona Beach.
The maximum wind at landfall was estimated near 135 miles per hour with gusts to 150 miles per hour and winds were still 90 miles per hour by the time the storm reached the Daytona Beach area.
(See page T-9 for Daytona Beach climatological ta ble.)

There are 350 open and covered berths which can accommodate vessels up to 90 feet in length.
Depths of 7 feet are reported alongside, and gasoline, diesel fuel, water, ice, electricity, and marine supplies are available.
State Route A1A bridge across the waterway at Port Orange Mile 835.5, is a fixed bridge with a clearance of 65 feet.
A boatyard and a marina are on the east side of the waterway, north of the bridge.
The boatyard 0.3 mile north of the bridge and the marina adjacent to the bridge have berths with electricity, gasoline, diesel fuel, water, ice and marine supplies.
Mobile hoists to 30 tons that can handle craft to 50 feet are available at the boatyard; hull repairs can be made.
Machine and car penter shops are on the premises.
Reported depths of 8 feet and 3 feet are alongside the boatyard and marina, respectively.
The waterway continues down the Halifax River to Mile 840.0 where it enters Ponce de Leon Cut.
Strong cross currents may be felt at times in this cut, due to the currents from Spruce Creek veering from one side to the other.
Inlet Harbor, 0.5 mile southeast of the waterway at Mile 839.6, is a small fishing port.
In 2002, the reported controlling depth from the waterway to the har bor was 6 feet; thence in 1983, 5 feet or more to the community of Ponce Inlet.
The channel is along the north shore and is not marked.
The wharf at Inlet Har bor has depths of about 8 feet alongside.
Berthage with electricity, gasoline, diesel fuel, water, ice, marine supplies and wet and dry storage are available.
Engine repairs can be made.
At the community of Ponce Inlet, about 1 mile below Inlet Harbor inside the north side of Ponce de Leon Inlet, there are several small-craft facilities where berthage with electricity, gasoline, diesel fuel, water, ice, launching ramps, and a 70-ton lift are available.
Hull, engine and electronic repairs can be made.
Ponce de Leon Inlet is described in chapter 10.
The waterway leaves Ponce de Leon Cut and enters Indian River North at Mile 843.5, about a mile southward of Ponce de Leon Inlet, and follows the river southward for about 15.5 miles through the marshes to Mosquito Lagoon.
In some places the river is narrow and crooked, requiring careful steering and close at tention to the channel daybeacons.
At Mile 845.0, there is a bascule span (SR44) with a clearance of 24 feet at the center.
At New Smyrna Beach, Mile 846.1, are several small-craft facilities and the Municipal Yacht Basin.

southerly flow) current from Sheephead Cut makes a cross current in a westerly direction north of the bridge.
Boats with tows proceeding southward during a flood current are advised to allow for the cross current.
An overhead power cable close northward of the bridge has a clearance of 85 feet.
The Intracoastal Waterway through Mosquito Lagoon and Indian River is through open water making the route rough at times, particularly during strong winds.
At Mile 868.5, the waterway enters Haulover Ca nal, a cut through the 0.4 mile-wide strip of land sepa rating Mosquito Lagoon from the Indian River.
Jetties, which have brush-covered sand deposits piled along their outer sides, extend almost 0.4 mile from shore at each end of the cut, giving the canal a total length of about 1.2 miles.
Wind tides are quite pronounced at times produc ing strong currents in the canal.
Southerly winds will build up the water level on the Indian River side of the canal and at the same time lower the water level on the Mosquito Lagoon side.
Northerly winds will cause the reverse effect.
At such times the normal water level var ies as much as 2 feet, with currents through the channel up to 1.5 knots setting in the direction of the wind.
At Mile 869.2, a highway bridge crosses near the center of Haulover Canal; the bridge has a bascule span with a clearance of 27 feet at the center.
Overhead power cables northeastward of the bridge have clear ances of 85 feet.
If a vessel must stop before passing through the bridge and a strong current is running, care should be taken to prevent setting against the rocky sides of the canal.

At Mile 869.8, the waterway enters Indian River, which extends southward for about 119 miles from Haulover Canal to St. Lucie Inlet.
In general, it is a broad lagoon quite shallow in places.
The spoil banks alongside the channel have built up in recent years and now appear as small islets on which are mangrove and other trees.
The river is nontidal except in the vicinity of Fort Pierce and for a short distance above the St. Lucie Inlet where the depth may vary as much as 2 feet under the influence of strong northerly and southerly winds.
Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge is on Merritt Island on the east side of the northern part of Indian River.

St. Lucie Inlet and River, Port Salerno, Port Sewall, and Stuart are described in chapter 10.
Extreme caution is advised when crossing St. Lucie River.
Cross currents will give a vessel an east or west set, depending on the direction and velocity of the current in the river.
Vessels should be able to stay in the channel by using the ranges on each side of the inter section.
To make a turn from the Intracoastal Waterway into St. Lucie River or vice versa, allowance must be made for the cross currents to prevent swinging too wide or too short.

Okeechobee Waterway From its junction with the Intracoastal Waterway in St. Lucie Inlet, Okeechobee Waterway follows St. Lucie River westward to South Fork, through South Fork and St. Lucie Canal, and enters Okeechobee Lake at Port Mayaca.
It crosses the southern part of the lake and exits at Moore Haven into Caloosahatchee Canal and thence into Caloosahatchee River, San Carlos Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico.
From San Carlos Bay, the Gulf section of the Intracoastal Waterway follows an inside route along the west coast of Florida to Anclote River, thence outside to Carrabelle Ship Channel in St. George Sound, and thence inside again through the re mainder of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas to Brownsville.
The Gulf section is described in United States Coast Pilot 5, Atlantic CoastÂ­Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands.
Mileage in the Okeechobee Waterway is measured westward from Mile 0.0 at the Intracoastal Waterway junction in St. Lucie Inlet.
The total length of the Okeechobee Waterway is about 155 miles from the At lantic Waterway to the Gulf of Mexico.
Mileage signs (statute miles) have been erected at the five locks.
Distances along the Okeechobee Waterway are in statute miles to facilitate reference to the small-craft charts; all other distances are in nautical miles.
Mileage conversion tables are on page T-23.
Channel The Federal project for the Okeechobee Waterway provides for a channel with a depth of 8 feet from the Intracoastal Waterway near Stuart via Okeechobee Lake Route 1 to Fort Myers; thence 10 feet to Punta Rassa; thence 12 feet to the Gulf of Mexico; a channel 6 feet deep in Taylor Creek from the town of Okeechobee to the lake, and a depth of 6 feet for Route 2 along the south shore of Lake Okeechobee from Port Mayaca
Sounding datums Depths charted in St. Lucie River from the Intracoastal Waterway to St. Lucie Lock are referred to mean low water.
From St. Lucie Lock through St. Lucie Canal and Lake Okeechobee to Moore Haven Lock, depths are referred to a low water elevation which is 12.56 feet above mean sea level.
From Moore Haven Lock through Caloosahatchee Canal to Ortona Lock, depths are referred to a low water elevation which is 10.06 feet above mean sea level.
In the Caloosahatchee River, the chart datum is mean lower low water.
Actual available depths are shown on gages displayed at each lock.
Hurricane gates are in the levee at Clewiston In dustrial Canal, Miami Drainage Canal, Hillsboro Ca nal-North New River Drainage Canal, and West Palm Beach Drainage Canal.
The hurricane gate at Clewiston is equipped with a lock that allows passage of small craft into Clewiston Industrial Canal.
Pumping sta tions are at the hurricane gates at Miami Drainage Ca nal, Hillsboro Canal-North New River Drainage Canal, and West Palm Beach Drainage Canal.
The gates are opened or closed only for pumping, and are not opened for boats.
Depths of 10 feet may be taken over the sills.
All gates have a width of 50 feet.
These canals are not navigable and have filled with hyacinths and other ob structions.
Tides The mean range of tide is 0.9 feet at the mouth of St. Lucie River.
The diurnal range of tide is 1.2 feet at Fort Myers and 2.4 feet at Punta Rassa.
At the eastern end of the waterway, tidal influence is perceptible to St. Lucie Lock (Mile 15.1) and at the western end, at low-water stage, is perceptible at Ortona Lock (Mile 93.5).
Cross currents at the junction of St. Lucie River with the Intracoastal Waterway make the short turn at that point hazardous.
Weather, Okeechobee Waterway and vicinity This route across the peninsula encounters a vari ety of climatic conditions.
In general, temperatures over the inland portions are slightly cooler in winter, particularly the lows, and warmer in summer.
The west coast also exhibits some of these continental tenden cies, due mainly to the prevalence of easterly winds.
For example, temperatures climb to 90Â°F (32.2Â°C) or above, on 106 days annually at Fort Myers, compared to 131 days at La Belle and 92 days near Stuart.
Freezing temperatures are infrequent on the coast and occur on an average of 1 to 2 days inland.

temperatures are tempered by the sea breeze along the east coast and by frequent afternoon showers and thun derstorms everywhere.
Thunderstorms develop on about 80 to 100 days annually, and are most likely from June through September.
They are generated by heat ing, fronts and tropical cyclones.
Thunderstorms can bring heavy rain, strong gusty winds and hail.
In severe cases tornadoes or waterspouts may develop.
While dangerous, these are usually smaller and less damaging than the tornadoes of the mid-West.
