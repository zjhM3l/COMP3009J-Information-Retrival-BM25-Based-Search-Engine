Characteristics Show the names of WATERFALLS if they are known.
Delineation The limit of a WATERFALL is the extent of the vertical or nearly vertical descent and the SHORELINES.
Depiction Conditions If a WATERFALL is named, Or If a WATERFALL is on a perennial STREAM/RIVER, has a vertical drop $ 10 feet, and extends from SHORELINE to SHORELINE, Then show.

Source Interpretation Guidelines All If a WATERFALL is within an area of closely spaced WATERFALLS, first show the upstream WATERFALL, then show as many others as can be depicted in the correct position.
The symbols must not overlap.
Graphic Names that contain the word "Falls" may indicate the feature RAPIDS.
Careful identification of the symbol is required to accurately determine whether the feature should be depicted as a RAPIDS or WATERFALL.
If WATERFALL is on a single-line STREAM/RIVER on the previously published map, depict the WATERFALL at the intersection of the tick and the STREAM/RIVER.
If a WATERFALL is shown by a tick on a double-line STREAM/RIVER on the previously published map, depict the WATERFALL by connecting the intersection of the tick and the SHORELINES.

Standards for USGS and USDA Forest Service Single Edition Quadrangle Maps Part 2: Hydrography WELL WELL - A pit or hole dug or bored into the earth for the extraction of oil, water, other fluids, or gases.
Characteristics Show the following WELLS based on the product involved: Heat Water Produces internal heat from the earth.
Produces water from the earth.
Show the following water WELLS based on the characteristic of the water: Alkaline Water shows evidence of alkali salts.
Hot Water temperature is higher than that of the human body (98.6 degrees F).
Sulphur Unspecified Water shows evidence of sulphur.
Does not have to be known or specified for the feature to be shown.
Show the following water WELLS with unspecified water characteristics based on their flow status: Flowing Water flows to the surface naturally.

Source Interpretation Guidelines All See appendix 2-A for the location of arid regions.
If a WELL is within an area of closely spaced WELLS, first show the named WELLS, then those that are on the perimeter of the area, then those that are the most prominent, then finally show a representative pattern of the WELLS internal to the area.
Show as many as can be depicted in the correct position.
The symbols must not overlap.
Irrigation wells are often enclosed in a structure and are usually found in wide areas along or at the end of field roads.
They may be evidenced by a wide wet collection area leading into a linear channel.
If a WELL produces a product other than heat or water, depict it in the Built-up theme.
Do not show dry water wells.
If a WELL is associated with a WINDMILL (Built-up theme), show the WINDMILL but do not show the WELL.

Show the following WRECKS based on the portion that is exposed at mean lower low water: Hull and/or Superstructure Mast and/or Funnel Show the names of WRECKS if they are known.
Delineation The limit of a WRECK is the extent of the hull or other remaining portion of the disabled vessel.
Depiction Conditions If a WRECK is exposed at mean lower low water and is on an existing National Ocean Service chart, Then show.
Source Interpretation Guidelines All If the abovewater portion of a WRECK is the mast and/or funnel, show the WRECK and a HAZARD ZONE.
