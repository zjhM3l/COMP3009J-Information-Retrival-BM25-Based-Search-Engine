The "Candy Desk" in the Senate Chamber: In 1968 California Senator George Murphy moved to a desk on the aisle of the last row on the Republican side of the Senate chamber, next to the door that leads to the elevators.
Senator Murphy had a sweet tooth and always kept candies in his desk drawer.
Given the senatorial traffic that regularly passed his new location, he invited other senators to help themselves.
The desk became known as "the candy desk" and each senator who subsequently occupied it carried on the tradition of keeping it well stocked with assorted mints, hard candies and chocolates.
Some senators specified specific brands of sweets that they preferred, and a few left money to defray the cost of their candy consumption.
Over time, the National Confectioners Association and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association began to provide a free assortment of products from most of the leading candy makers.
The staff of the senator who occupies the desk makes sure that the desk drawer is filled each week that the Senate is in session.
The desk is usually assigned to a junior member of the Senate.
Previous occupants of the Candy Desk include Senators John McCain, Slade Gorton, Robert Bennett.
Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania currently occupies that seat.
