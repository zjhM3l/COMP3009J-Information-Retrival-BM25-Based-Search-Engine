THE MINERAL INDUSTRY OF ICELAND By Harold R. Newman Owing to abundant hydroelectric and geothermal energy and the lack of domestic resources, the mineral industry of Iceland largely comprised metal production from imported materials.
Iceland has few proven mineral resources, although deposits of diatomite were being developed.
All production of industrial minerals, with the exception of diatomite, was used by local industries (table 1).
Because of geographic proximity to the European Union and existing trade agreements, most of Iceland's trade was with Europe.
The majority of the shares in the major mineral enterprises were held by the Government.
The remaining enterprises were either foreign-owned and locally operated or, for smaller businesses, locally owned and operated (table 2).
For a more extensive coverage of the mineral industry of Iceland, see the 1998 Minerals Yearbook, volume III, Mineral Industries of Europe and Central Eurasia.
