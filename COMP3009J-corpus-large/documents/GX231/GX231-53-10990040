OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY
Objectives
In accordance with Title 24 of the Alaska Statutes and a special request by the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee, we conducted a review of oil industry resident hire issues administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
The Legislative Budget and Audit Committee expressed concern for local hire, procurement and contracting within the oil industry in the State and requested that we review the oil industry's record on these subjects.
Specifically, we reviewed information on the oil industry for the past five years on local hire.
We also reviewed information provided to us by selected oil companies related to their local procurement and contracting policies.
Scope and Methodology
The primary focus of our review was the historical trends and recent events on local hire in the oil industry over the period 1991 through 1995.
We limited our review of procurement and contracting activities to discussions with oil industry management and certain documents furnished by them.
A complete review was not practicable due to the proprietary nature of private companies' policies and accounting records.
During the course of our examination, we interviewed various state employees including staff within the Governor's Office, DOL and DNR.
We also had discussions with representatives of various companies within the oil industry; and interviewed members of the Joint State-Industry Working Group on Local Hire in Alaska's Oil Fields.
In addition, we reviewed and evaluated the following:
1.
Applicable sections of state statutes and regulations; 2.
Reports from DOL's Occupational Data Base; 3.
Selected DOL Alaska Economic Trends articles; 4.
DOL Nonresidents Working in Alaska reports; 5.
Minutes of the Joint State-Industry Working Group on Local Hire in Alaska's Oil Fields; 6.
Publications from various oil industry companies; 7.
Selected Petroleum News articles; 8.
Applicable opinions of the Attorney General; 9.
Chapter 139, SLA 1996 (HB 548, Northstar Unit Oil 
Other documents and interviews as deemed pertinent.

ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION
Title 23 of the Alaska Statutes provide, in part, "The Department of Labor shall foster and promote the welfare of the wage earners of the state, improve their working conditions and advance their opportunities for profitable employment."
This statute also provides, "The department shall aid and assist resident workers to obtain, safeguard, and protect their rightful preference to be employed in industries in the state."
The Department of Labor's (DOL) efforts to comply with the mandate in Title 23 include the coordination of three organizational units: the Commissioner's Office, the Employment Security Division and the Research and Analysis section.
The Commissioner of DOL is a member of the Joint State-Industry Working Group on Local Hire in Alaska's Oil Fields and is responsible for overall management of the department's programs.
The Employment Security Division promotes employment, economic stability, and growth; operating a no-fee labor exchange that meets the needs of employers, job seekers, and veterans.
The division operates the Employment Services program that includes; job placement, job matching and referral, vocational counseling, and job search assistance.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The oil industry in Alaska, due to its dynamic nature and significant economic impacts, has been the source of much discussion.
The industry has been involved in an unprecedented amount of legislation, lawsuits, and continued business negotiations with the State.
Part of the reason for this intense interest is the magnitude of both the industry's workforce and related payroll.
The Department of Labor's (DOL) 1995 Nonresidents Working in Alaska report describes the importance of oil industry jobs:
These are among the highest paying, year-round jobs in Alaska and are considered a high priority for placement of Alaskan workers.
Faced with expected declines in total workers and continued shift of work to contractors with relatively high [numbers of] nonresident workers, improvements in resident hire performance will require coordination with training agencies and a strong commitment to resident hire.
Over the decade covering 1985 through 1995, DOL reports that total oil industry workers have fluctuated between a low of 11,466 and a high of 14,701, with payrolls ranging from $528,151,000 to $762,481,095.
Resident hire issues in the oil patch have a long and colorful history
In recognition of the significant economic impact of the oil industry, the Legislature in the early 70s, passed an Act entitled "Local Hire Under State Leases."
The key provision of the Alaska Hire act was that:
all oil and gas leases, easements or right of way permits for oil or gas pipeline purposes, utilization agreements, or any renegotiation of any of the preceding to which the state is a party contained provisions requiring the preference of qualified Alaskan residents . . .
The Alaska Hire provision was not seriously enforced until 1975, when DOL began issuing residency cards and giving preference to resident cardholders for deployment on oil pipeline jobs.
In 1976 a former commissioner of DOL issued a cease and desist order to all unions supplying pipeline workers and enjoining them to "respond to all open job calls by dispatching all qualified Alaskan residents before any non-residents are dispatched."
A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Alaska Hire was filed.
Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned most of the Alaska Hire provisions in 1978.
As an apparent result of the Alaska Hire provisions being overturned, interest in the issue, from state government's perspective, waned.
Though resident hire language had been incorporated into most oil and gas lease agreements beginning in 1972, no local hire monitoring or feedback to companies took place.
In 1984, a former director of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Oil and Gas Division waived the lease provision that required companies to file annual resident hire program reports (see Recommendation No. 1).
As a result, from 1984 through 1996, oil companies neither reported nor, to our knowledge, maintained local hire information.
Nonresidents Working in Alaska report based on data captured in Occupational Data Base (ODB)
One remnant of the local hire legislation, AS 36.10.130, requires DOL to
report annually to the governor on the status of employment in the state, the effect on nonresident employment on the employment of residents in the state and the methods to increase resident hire.
Though DOL has continued to produce an annual report, the scope and detail do not completely address the effects of nonresident employment or methods to increase resident hire (see Recommendation No. 2).
DOL's analysis of information produced by its ODB comprises the bulk of this report.
The ODB contains a combination of information from DOL's computerized Unemployment Insurance electronic wage file which is matched with the Department of Revenue's (DOR) computerized Permanent Fund Dividend file.
Employees shown on the wage file that have either received the previous year's dividend or applied for the current year dividend are considered residents.
Information in the ODB has been segregated by company, industry, and occupation to provide various detailed reports in the annual residential hire report.
The ODB has also been used to produce ad hoc requests for various parties.
__________________________________________________________________
Paragraph 41 of the Revised Northstar Unit Oil Leases EMPLOYMENT OF ALASKAN RESIDENTS.
Lessee shall comply with all valid federal, State and local laws in hiring Alaska residents and contractors and shall not discriminate against Alaska residents or contractors.
Within the constraints of law, lessee shall employ Alaska residents and contractors to the extent they are available and qualified.
Subject to the foregoing: Lessee voluntarily agrees to adopt a program to hire residents of Alaska.
Lessee shall advertise for available positions locally and use Alaska job service organizations to notify the Alaskan public.
For work in connection with this lease, lessee shall use best efforts to contract with Alaska firms and fabricate modules in Alaska, whenever feasible.
Lessee shall encourage its contractors to employ and train, when necessary, residents of Alaska.
In determining feasibility, lessee shall consider commercial, health, safety, and environmental conditions and requirements to ensure maintenance of lessee's operational standards.
Lessee shall submit annually to the director, division of oil and gas, for transmission to the Department of Labor, a report that details the specific measures lessee and its contractors and subcontractors have taken or are planning to take to recruit qualified Alaska residents for available jobs, describes on-the-job training opportunities, and describes lessee's efforts to hire Alaska firms for work in connection to this lease.
Lessee shall furnish the Department of Labor a quarterly report regarding the employment of Alaska residents on the leased area in compliance with regulations by the Commissioner of Labor.
The report must also include statistical data concerning the number of resident personnel hired within the past year for this lease.

Northstar oil lease revisions refocus State attention on local hire issues
In 1996, the oil lease agreement for the Northstar field was renegotiated to change the State's percentage of the profit from that field.
As a part of the renegotiation, the legislature included findings and intent related to resident hire and specified reporting requirements.
See text box at right.
The Legislature described the importance of these issues in specific intent language:
. . . the mutual commitments made by the parties to the lessee in these amendments to secure state residents and businesses the advantages and benefits of both expanded resident hire opportunities and additional work by in-state businesses are in the best interest of the people of the state and are considerations of paramount importance to the legislature in its decision to conditionally approve the amendments of the Northstar Unit leases.
Since the Northstar lease revision, resident hire issues have reached new levels of significance for State agencies and oil companies.
DOL has been recruited to provide supplemental resident hire information.
Oil companies, which typically form alliances with contractors on large projects, have reviewed, and, in some cases, revised policies that impact resident hire for alliance members.
Governor and Industry form Working Group to address specific local hire issues
The inclusion by DNR of local hire provisions in the Northstar lease resurrected an issue dormant since 1984, when local hire reporting requirements were waived.
One vital piece of the resident hire puzzle is the definition of "resident."
DOL had long used a match between the DOL electronic wage file and the PFD electronic file to distinguish residents from non-residents.
Oil industry officials found fault with this methodology, claiming that, for a number of reasons, it materially understated the number of Alaska residents on their payrolls.
Northstar legislation also refocused attention on resident hire reporting required by lessees and resulted in discussions about which information should be reported.
To address these and other issues, the governor and the oil industry appointed a Joint State-Industry Working Group on Local Hire in Alaska's Oil Fields (working group).
The working group consists of State agency officials appointed by the governor and oil industry representatives appointed by the industry.
The working group was charged with developing a methodology for oil companies and their contractors to voluntarily report local hire information and to set benchmarks from which to measure progress in residential hire.
As a result of the working group's efforts, a new definition of resident, which incorporates elements more acceptable to oil industry officials, has been adopted.
The working group has also decided to set 1996 as a benchmark to measure resident hire statistics.

AUDITOR'S COMMENTS
As discussed in the Background Information section, the oil industry can be segmented into four categories as shown in the chart below.
These categories, referred to as standard industry codes (SICs), are defined by the U.S. Department of Labor and used for nationwide reporting purposes as well as for various reports within the state.
SIC Category Description 1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Oil Operating Companies (Oil Operating Companies) Establishments primarily engaged in operating oil and gas field properties.
Such activities include exploration for crude petroleum and natural gas; drilling, completing, and equipping wells; operation of separators, emulsion breakers, desilting equipment; and all other activities in the preparation of oil and gas up to the point of shipment from the producing property.
This industry also includes the production of oil through the mining and extraction of oil from oil shale and oil sands.
1381 Drilling Oil and Gas Wells (Oil Drilling Companies) Establishments primarily engaged in drilling wells for oil or gas field operations or others on a contract fee, or similar basis.
This industry includes contractors that specialize in "spudding in," "drilling in," redrilling and redirectional drilling.
1382 Oil and Gas Field Exploration Services (Oil Exploration Companies) Establishments primarily engaged in performing geophysical, geological, and other exploration services for oil and gas on a contract, fee, or similar basis.
1389 Oil Field Services, Not Elsewhere Classified (Oil Field Service Companies) Establishments primarily engaged in performing oil and gas field services, not elsewhere classified, for others on a contract, fee, or similar basis, such as excavating slush pits and cellars; grading and building of foundations at well locations; well surveying; running, cutting and pulling casings, tubes, and rods; cementing wells, shooting wells; perforating well casing; acidizing and treating wells; and cleaning out, bailing, and swabbing wells.
As is evident from the chart above, each of the four segments of the oil industry are characterized by unique types of work requiring a wide variety of skilled employees.
The differences between these segments affect the number of employees per segment and the percentage of those employees that are nonresidents.
As shown in the following graph, the segmented composition of Alaska's oil industry workforce has varied over the years, with the most significant shift in recent years being from the oil operating companies to the oil field service companies.
In 1991, oil operating company employees comprised 31% of the oil industry workforce.
By 1995, this percentage had dropped to 25%.
During the same timeframe, oil field service company employees increased from 55% of the workforce to 66%.
[4560rp01.gif]
The percentage of nonresidents employed in the oil industry also varies significantly by segment.
As shown in the graph below, from 1991 through 1995, only one of the four segments, oil exploration, shows a steady reduction in the percentage of nonresident employees.
Two of the segments, oil field service companies, and oil operating companies, show steady increases in their nonresident employment rates.
Over the five years ending in 1995, these two segments have increased their nonresident workforce by 5% and 6%, respectively.
As discussed previously, these two segments are the largest in the industry so nonresident hire rate increases in these segments significantly impact the oil industry workforce as a whole.
[4560rp02.gif]
Nonresident employment grows while total employment declines
The oil industry as a whole reflects some of the same characteristics as its two largest components, oil operating companies and oil field service companies.
In 1992, the number of employees in the industry dropped by about 15.5% from the previous year.
Since that time, the annual total workforce has either grown only slightly or declined.
The nonresident portion of employees remaining in the industry has grown steadily since 1992 (see graph below).
[4560rp03.gif]
As discussed in the Background Information section, the working group has selected 1996 as the benchmark year from which to measure resident hire progress.
However, the relatively slow growth rate of the oil industry may hinder the ability of companies within the industry to change their nonresident employee rates.
In a letter to Governor Knowles discussing local hire issues, one company summarizes this situation as it relates to the current year: ". . .
1997 is projected to be a flat construction year.
Therefore, it is highly probable that Alaska hire percentages will go down, even if we had all the processes in place today."
Oil industry workers become residents at lower rates than total workforce
About 14% of the total nonresident workforce in 1994 became residents in 1995.
The number of nonresidents becoming residents each year in the oil industry, however, has traditionally been much lower.
For example, only 8.2% of the industry workers shown as nonresidents in 1994 became residents in 1995.
The change from 1993 to 1994 was also less than 10%.
Occupational information by company not comparable between companies
The Department of Labor's (DOL) electronic wage file provides additional information on the occupational composition of companies.
Each company determines occupational classification for each employee's wages reported for Unemployment Insurance.
Guidelines for the classifications are offered by the U.S. Department of Labor as Standard Occupational Codes.
DOL reviews the classifications for reasonableness in the aggregate, but specific occupations within companies are not necessarily reviewed.
The occupational composition of companies is affected by both their oil industry segment and by the companies' particular line of work.
The differences between companies at the occupational level are so significant that comparisons of companies by occupation would be unreliable.
Though such information would provide invaluable analysis in this report, due to differences in the way companies determine the occupations of their employees, we did not perform this analysis.
__________________________________________________________________
REPORT CONCLUSIONS
As discussed in the Background Information section, state agency attention to local hire issues within the oil industry has been inconsistent.
One possible result of this inconsistency is the oil industry's increasing rate of nonresident hire through at least 1995.
However, the Northstar lease amendment discussions renewed State interest in local hire issues and has resulted in recent oil industry efforts to increase resident hire.
Lack of state enforcement of local hire requirements correlates with increase in nonresident hire
As discussed in the Background Information section, actions by the Departments of Natural Resources and Labor (DNR and DOL) over the last decade, reduced the State's emphasis on the oil industry's local hire efforts.
DNR's waiver of resident reporting requirements combined with DOL's limited reporting in the annual Nonresidents Working in Alaska suggest that local hire issues have, until recently, taken a less significant role.
(See Recommendation Nos. 1 and 2).
Actions by these departments may have contributed to a reduction in the oil industry's local hire efforts.
One oil company official characterized the issue of resident hire as "not a high profile item" in recent years before 1996.
During this time, the oil companies we contacted neither maintained nor reported nonresident hire statistics for themselves or for their contractors, though some lease agreements contained continuing requirements to "hire and employ local and Alaska residents."
During the time that State and oil industry interest in the local hire issue was low, the percentage of nonresidents employed in the oil industry increased significantly.
According to DOL's 1995 Nonresidents Working in Alaska, the number of nonresidents employed between 1993 and 1995 increased by 25%.
Another way to analyze the number of nonresidents employed in the industry is to measure the annual change in nonresident employment.
To do this, we calculated percent change from year to year by analyzing only the increase or decrease of resident or nonresident employees from the previous year's workforce.
For example, in 1994, there were 3,522 nonresident workers.
In 1995, there were 4,063 nonresident workers.
The difference between these, 541, is an increase of 15.36%.
[4560rp04.gif]
In certain years since 1992, the percentage of nonresidents increased while the percentage of residents decreased.
As shown in the graph above, each year since 1992, the percentage of nonresidents employed in the oil industry has increased, while the percentage of residents has decreased or grown at a lower rate.
Complete resident hire information is not yet available for 1996, but early indications are that the trend of increasing nonresident hire continued through 1996.
Northstar reporting for contractors/subcontractors more stringent than for subsequent leases
As discussed in the Background Information section, various requirements for lessees to report on resident hire activity have been incorporated into lease agreements since 1972.
Some of these agreements have included provisions for the lessee to report not only measures they have taken to improve resident hire rates, but also the related activities of their contractors and subcontractors.
The reporting requirements for certain leases, however, were waived in 1984, and, until recently, the State had received no reports from either lessees or their subcontractors.
Though lease language contained in the Northstar amendment seemed to be precedent setting, lease agreements drafted by DNR since that time have not included provisions for reporting the activities of contractors or subcontractors.
The amended Northstar lease agreement requires the lessee to:
. . . submit annually to the director, division of oil and gas, for transmission to the Department of Labor, a report that details the specific measures lessee and its contractors and subcontractors have taken or are planning to take to recruit qualified Alaska residents for available jobs, describes on-the-job training opportunities, and describes lessee's efforts to hire Alaska firms for work in connection with this lease.
Lease agreements subsequent to the Northstar amendment, however, ". . . encourage lessee to hire and employ local and Alaska residents and companies, to the extent they are available and qualified, for work performed on the leased area" and, for reporting, will require the lessee only to "submit, with the plans of operations, a proposal detailing the means by which the lessee will comply with this measure."
Oil companies typically form alliances of core contractors and subcontractors for large projects.
By requiring lessees to report on the resident hire activities for their contractors and subcontractors the state implies to the lessee that the lessee will be held accountable for the results of their contractor's hiring practices.
Conversely, by not requiring this level of accountability, the state fails to benefit from the relationship between the lessee and its contractors and subcontractors.
Local hire efforts emerge from obscurity
As noted in the Background Information section, discussions related to amendments to the Northstar lease once again brought local hire issues to the attention of both State and industry officials.
Both the State and the industry demonstrated this renewed interest in resident hire through formation of groups to address the various problems associated with resident hire and reporting.
The most far reaching group to date has been the Joint State-Industry Working Group on Local Hire in Alaska's Oil Fields (working group).
The working group has developed methodologies to count the percentage of nonresidents working in the industry and establishing a benchmark from which to measure improvement.
The working group has also endorsed the formation of a formal Oil Industry Business Learning Consortium at the July 9, 1997 meeting.
An ad-hoc industry-State committee formulated and recommended this action to the working group.
The consortium would include oil developers, contractors, suppliers to the industry, post-secondary educators, State agencies and labor representatives.
The purpose of the consortium is to create recruitment and job training mechanisms to meet industry and state workforce development needs.
The Northstar lease amendment, which passed the legislature in July 1996, replaced the "Employment of Alaskan Residents" lease provisions for all five previous Northstar leases, which DNR had waived in 1984.
The amendment requires quarterly and annual reports.
The quarterly reports address the employment of residents working on the leased areas.
The annual reports require that the lessee report on the measures the lessee and its contractors and subcontractors have taken to recruit qualified Alaskans, including descriptions of on-the-job training opportunities and lessee's efforts to hire Alaskan contractors.
Northstar amendment inspires industry to take measures to increase local hire
The Northstar amendment has renewed interest in local hire, contracting and procurement efforts for the oil industry.
In August 1996, British Petroleum (BP) established the position of "Manager, Local Hire."
BP created this position to coordinate the companies' efforts to maximize Alaska hire and training opportunities.
In addition to naming a local hire manager, oil companies and members of project alliances have recently taken other measures to "grow the Alaskan workforce."
Various educational programs, including on-the-job training, are measures the industry has used to increase the number of available employees with the required skills.
In November 1996, some of the contractors in the Northstar alliance formed a relationship with the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) for advanced technical training for current and former employees.
UAA provided instructors and facilities for the course.
Curricula were developed with the involvement of lead superintendents in companies with specific knowledge of skills needed on North Slope projects.
The most recent program graduated 37 people with technical certificates.
Contractors have also made additional education efforts through arrangements with the Martin Luther King Career Center for employees to receive welding training.
Another major resident recruitment effort involved employees from the Ketchikan Pulp Mill.
In an effort to recruit laid off pulp mill workers, several alliance contractors visited Ketchikan at the beginning of 1997.
When certain gaps in the training backgrounds of some of these individuals were identified, the contractors began to work with the University of Alaska Southeast-Ketchikan to develop curricula
...to increase the work assimilation of these individuals that want to enhance their trade skills; with the prospects for candidacy for employment in the oil and gas industry.
Because many of the industry efforts aimed at increasing local hire are recent, their effects are not yet assessable.
Nonetheless, in our view, these efforts demonstrate an increased interest in reducing the nonresident hire rates that have become so common to the oil industry.
Salaries vary by oil industry segment
As discussed in Auditor's Comments, the DOL Unemployment Insurance (UI) electronic wage file categorizes the oil industry into four segments based on federal reporting standards.
Segments included in the oil industry category are operating, drilling, exploration and field service.
In a comparison of the oil industry segments by salary level, we found that wages paid to employees of oil operating companies are higher than those paid to employees of oil field service companies.
However, the oil operating segment employed only 25% of the oil industry workers in 1995, while the oil field service segment employed 66%.
As noted in the 1995 Nonresidents Working in Alaska report, there has been a shift in the oil industry workforce from oil companies to oil field service companies.
As shown in the chart on the following page, average wages paid in 1995 for each occupational series in the oil operating segment are higher than for the oil field service segment.
[4560rp05.gif]
Composition, size, type of work affect oil industry companies' resident hire rates
Additional analysis of resident hire statistics shows that nonresident employment percentages of individual companies in the oil industry vary significantly.
The percentage of nonresidents by company ranges from 2.86% to 90.91% for 1995.
Company size, line of work, occupations, work schedules and work locations have all been reported to impact the number of residents employed.
Larger companies may be able to provide additional resources to improve resident employment percentages.
One major employer, for example, requires their Alaska resident employees to maintain a residence in Alaska to be eligible for the cost of living allowance (COLA).
In addition, they require every Alaska resident employee to sign an annual certification affirming their residency.
This company has, over the last few years, had one of the lower nonresident percentages in their segment and in the industry.
Most companies do not have COLAs, and as a possible consequence, have higher nonresident percentages.
In 1997, another major oil industry employer adopted the requirement that employees maintain an Alaskan residence to be eligible for the resident COLA.
Other efforts that may increase the Alaska resident workforce include a one time moving allowance for employees to relocate their residences to Alaska and an annual travel allowance for employees and their dependents.
As with the COLA, larger companies with comparatively more financial flexibility are more likely to offer these benefits than their smaller counterparts.
The relative size of a company is only one area in which oil industry companies are not comparable.
The line of work for the companies and the occupations of their employees also impact the employment of residents.
Companies in the oil field service segment vary from general contractors to highly specialized firms.
Smaller companies sometimes specialize in one line of work in the oil industry.
Highly specialized companies typically require employees with advanced training and skills and are more likely to employ nonresidents.
Examples of occupations with high nonresident employment rates include engineering and precision production occupations, which are prominent within oil field service companies.
Both occupations have a nonresident employment percentage in excess of 40%.
These two occupations are the only two that exceed 40% for the oil industry by segment in 1995.
Work schedules and locations may also impact the number of residents employed.
Work schedules vary depending on the company and work location.
Work schedules range from one week on and one week off to four weeks on and three weeks off for employees working on the North Slope.
Employees with longer breaks between work periods have a greater potential to maintain a residence outside of Alaska due to their rotation.
Employees working shorter schedules are less likely to travel as far from the North Slope due to the shorter time periods between work and time off.
__________________________________________________________________
Chapter 139, SLA 96 In 1996, the legislature defined the phrases "Alaska contractors" and "Alaska firms" to mean a firm or contractor that (1) has held an Alaska business license for one year before performing any work in connection with the Northstar leases; (2) has maintained for one year a place of business within the state that deals in the supplies, services, or construction of the nature required for the project before performing any work in connection with the Northstar leases; and (3) is (A) a sole proprietorship and the proprietor is an Alaska resident; (B) a partnership and more than 50 percent of the partners are Alaska residents; (C) a corporation that has been incorporated in the state or is authorized to do business in the state; or (D) is a joint venture composed entirely of ventures that qualify under this paragraph.
(h) For purposes of the Employment Paragraphs, the legislature intends that the lessee's reporting obligations comply with the reporting requirements of 8 AAC 30.062 and shall include information regarding the number of nonresidents hired within the past year, and the number of Alaska contractors and non-Alaska contractors hired within the past year.
__________________________________________________________________
Majority of oil industry companies are "Alaska Businesses" as defined by Northstar
In a survey of each of the companies listed in DOL's 1995 Occupational Data Base (ODB), we found that 81% of the oil industry companies were Alaskan corporations, sole proprietorships or partnerships.
We noted some differences between the four segments of the oil industry.
All oil operating corporations were incorporated in Alaska.
All but one oil exploration and one oil drilling company were incorporated in Alaska.
The majority of oil field service corporations were incorporated in Alaska, but this category also included a sole proprietorship, with the owner qualifying as an Alaska resident and a partnership with the partners qualifying as Alaska corporations.
All of the qualified Alaskan corporations, sole proprietorships or partnerships identified hold current Alaska business licenses.
We found that 19% of the oil industry companies could not be identified as Alaskan corporations, sole proprietorships or partnerships.
All but five companies hold current business licenses.
According to Oil Companies, centralized procurement on major projects helps ensure use of Alaska vendors
Major oil companies developing new oil fields form alliances with contractors to complete large projects.
As the lead alliance member, the oil company contracts with different companies for engineering, fabrication, construction and maintenance.
Oil companies have centralized procurement for major oil development projects.
They procure the majority of the materials and supplies for their contractors and the contractors assemble the materials and supplies.
Some of the larger contractors provide their purchasing personnel to the major oil companies to assist in the procurement process.
According to an industry source, centralized procurement has increased purchases from Alaskan vendors.
Vendors have historically been unable to provide certain items.
A spokesperson for one of the oil companies summarizes the situation:
Our experience has been that Alaska suppliers can compete most effectively on items for which there are uses in industries outside of the oil industry.
They are less successful providing items that are unique to the oil industry such as chemicals, special turbines and major compressor parts.
Procurement policies vary from company to company, but according to several of the larger companies they have initiated policies that may favor Alaska vendors.
These policies range from simply providing an opportunity for Alaska vendors to bid for certain contracts to developing and using an Alaska supplier network.
__________________________________________________________________
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation No. 1
The commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) should ensure that lease provisions related to reporting on resident hire are enforced in old leases and included in new leases and permits.
Beginning in 1972, oil and gas leases have contained various provisions encouraging the lessee to hire Alaska residents and to report the results of their local hire efforts.
In 1984, the former director of the Oil and Gas Division of DNR waived the reporting requirement for some of the leases in effect at that time (see Appendix A).
Apparently these requirements were waived because the director had become convinced that lessee's reports of residential hire were duplicative of reports required under Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws.
Though some of the lease provisions included requirements for reporting on the residential hire practices of contractors and subcontractors and other information that was not duplicated in the UI reports, it appears that enforcement of all reporting requirements related to residential hire practices and statistics was suspended.
The local hire provision contained within the most recent lease agreement provided by DOG reads as follows:
The lessee is encouraged to hire and employ local and Alaska residents and companies, to the extent they are available and qualified, for work performed on the leased area.
Lessees shall submit, with the plans of operations, a proposal detailing the means by which the lessee will comply with this measure.
The lessee is encouraged, in formulating this proposal, to coordinate with employment services offered by the State of Alaska and local communities and to recruit employees from local communities.
Unlike some of the earlier lease agreements, the current lease agreement neither requires nor encourages the lessee to maintain and report their own or any contractors' resident hire statistics on a regular basis.
The current lease agreement also differs from older leases by not requiring the lessee to report on measures they or their contractors have taken to improve residential hire statistics.
The oil industry is a relatively large employer in the state, accounting for more than 26% of Alaska's 100 largest private employer payrolls.
The oil industry is also one with a relatively high rate of nonresidential hire, which has recently been increasing on an industry wide basis.
One way to ensure that companies in the oil industry are aware of their non-residential hire rates and are taking action to improve those rates is to require resident hire reporting.
The reporting requirement is most easily incorporated into lease provisions as parties either negotiate new lease agreements or revise existing leases.
These requirements should also become a part of any State permits issued for work on leased lands.
DNR's leasing and permitting processes may also allow the State to encourage local hire in other natural resources industries.
To the extent legally possible, the State should consider incorporating local hire language into all leases and permits.
AS 23.05.010 requires the Department of Labor (DOL) to "foster and promote the welfare of the wage earners of the state, improve their working conditions and advance their opportunities for profitable employment."
To assist DOL in meeting their statutory requirement to advance opportunities for profitable employment, the director of DNR's Oil and Gas Division should resume enforcement of resident hire reporting requirements in existing leases.
Additionally, future lease agreements and permits should contain requirements for each of the lessees to regularly report on residential hiring policies and statistics for not only their own company but also for their contractors and subcontractors.
Recommendation No. 2
The commissioner of the Department of Labor should improve measures to ensure that the Nonresidents Working in Alaska report provides the information required by Alaska Statute.
Alaska Statute (AS) 36.10.130 requires the commissioner of DOL to "report annually to the governor on the status of employment in the state, the effect of nonresident employment on the employment of residents in the state, and methods to increase resident hire."
DOL's R
This report has provided overall industry information on nonresidents working in Alaska and general analysis of various industries.
However, the report has only provided limited analysis on the effect of nonresident employment on the employment of residents and on proposed methods to increase resident hire.
In 1994, the Executive Branch submitted a $50,000 budget decrement to the Legislature for the R
This reduction was specifically aimed at the residential hire report program, reportedly in response to Supreme Court rulings declaring most of the state's resident hire requirements unconstitutional.
DOL staff comment that the rulings seemed to diminish the importance of resident hire statistics and the resident hire issue "dropped off the screen."
Though DOL continued to produce a resident hire report, the report was no longer specifically funded and was reduced in scope.
Recent changes in the Northstar oil lease suggest that resident hire issues are once again receiving public attention.
Large oil companies and oil field service companies represented in a working group established to improve Alaska hire in the oil industry have expressed an interest in working with the various state employment service agencies to increase local hire.
The Nonresidents Working in Alaska report and other Occupational Data Base data could provide valuable information to assist the commissioner in achieving DOL's statutory mandate (see Recommendation No. 3.)
DOL's commissioner should ensure that the division has adequate funding to produce the report required by AS 36.10.130.
Additionally, DOL should revise the content of the report to include an analysis of the effect of nonresident employment on the employment of residents in the State, and methods to increase resident hire as required by the authorizing statute.
Recommendation No. 3
The DOL should use the statistical information from its Occupational Data Base (ODB) to analyze, monitor and provide feedback to major employers within the state and to assist with employment assistance and training efforts.
AS 23.05.010 requires the Department of Labor to "... foster and promote the welfare of the wage earners of the state, improve their working conditions and advance their opportunities for profitable employment."
In our view, this requirement would best be met through a comprehensive effort involving analysis of available employment information, contact with major employers throughout the State, and coordination with placement services provided by the Employment Services section.
The oil industry employs a high number of nonresidents and accounts for some of the highest wages paid in the state.
Unquestionably, increasing resident hire rates in this industry would help to advance Alaskan residents' opportunities for more profitable employment.
However, DOL's training and job growth efforts have not included communications with oil industry employers.
DOL's ODB contains comprehensive resident hire information by occupation and by company.
As noted in Recommendation No. 1, oil and gas leases contain various local hire reporting requirements.
Information provided by lessees used in conjunction with information from the ODB would form a valuable base from which DOL could monitor and assist companies in their progress toward resident hire goals.
DOL should analyze, monitor and provide feedback to major employers within the State who have high nonresident employee statistics.
Monitoring may include comparing individual companies' nonresident hire rates with previous years rates and industry averages to identify those companies that employ a high percentage of nonresidents.
These companies should then be contacted to discuss reasons and possible remedies for high nonresident hire rates.
The results of the resident hire analysis and feedback from private industry combined with information submitted as required by oil and gas leases could provide employment and training agencies with vital information for better directing job search and training efforts.
The Division of Employment Security and the Alaska Human Resource Investment Council (AHRIC) are examples of recipients that could utilize this information when working with private industry employers to assist in improving resident hire.

APPENDIX A
NOTICE
RESIDENT-HIRE REPORTING REQUIREMENT WAIVED
In response to continuing concerns over the hiring of local residents, the state included for Oil and Gas Lease Sales 34, 360 39 and 40 and Geothermal Lease Sale I a measure which encouraged the lessee to hire Alaska residents and required submission of an annual program detailing the steps the lessee plans to take to hire residents, as well as the results of the Alaska hire program.
Since the beginning of the reporting program, the division has transmitted the completed Resident Hire forms to the Department of Labor for use in designing educational programs to better prepare state residents for future oil and gas-related job opportunities.
Recently, the Commissioner of Labor informed the division that the Department of Labor no longer has a use for the data from the reports.
In addition, numerous lessees have informed the division that preparing these reports has become burdensome.
As a result of these comments on the effectiveness of the program and Its costs to lessees, the division has reevaluated the need for continuing the reporting requirements.
The Office of the Attorney General has advised the division that if the intent of the provision is not being met, it is permissible to waive it.
Consequently, the requirement that lessees file the annual resident hire program report required by the leases issued in Oil and Gas Lease Sales 34, 360 39, and 40 and Geothermal Lease Sale 1 is suspended immediately.
The State of Alaska still encourages the hiring of Alaska residents, particularly those who reside in the areas of lease operations.
Your cooperation in ensuring that Alaska residents and Alaska companies are hired, to the extent they are available and qualified, for work performed on leases issued by the State of Alaska is appreciated.
If you have any questions regarding the resident hire reporting requirement please contact me or Jim Eason at (907) 265-4241.

Randy S. Welker Legislative Auditor Division of Legislative Audit Alaska State Legislature P.O. Box 113300 Juneau, AK 99811-3300 Re: Preliminary Audit Report: DOL/DNR; Oil Company Hiring, Procurement, and Contracting Issues (8/31/97)
Dear Mr. Welker:
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the preliminary findings of your audit of resident hire programs in Alaska.
First, let me assure you that the Department of Labor's commitment to providing employment opportunities to Alaska residents in fulfillment of our statutory mission is unwavering.
Through a variety of programs and with ongoing efforts by this department and others - we have enforced what remains of Alaska's resident hire laws after court actions, collected and published data showing the number of non-residents working in Alaska, worked closely with employers to encourage them to hire Alaskans, worked with training providers to design training programs to better meet the needs of employers, and directed state-funded training program dollars to training for occupations that have a high percentage of nonresidents.
I would add that most of these activities are conducted without the benefit of specific funding for resident hire efforts.
It is true that the focus of our resident hire work has shifted over time in response to changing economic conditions, legislative mandates, and - most significantly - the availability (or lack thereof) of funds.
Although I cannot speak to the policies of prior administrations, I can state emphatically that our current focus is to do everything we can to maximize the hiring of resident workers, especially in high-paying, year-round jobs.
Although there are many factors that affect the number of non-residents working in Alaska, the most current data for 1996 shows that, in total, the percentage and number of nonresidents in the state has declined since 1994.
8000 more Alaskans (and 2300 fewer non-residents) were employed at some point in 1996 than were in 1994.
On the whole, I feel we are moving in the right direction, albeit not as fast as we'd like, particularly with regard to the oil and gas industry.
Before addressing your specific recommendations pertaining to the Department of Labor, I would have to take issue with two of the report's conclusions:
"Lack of state enforcement of local hire requirements correlates with increase in nonresident hire."
This finding suggests the existence of legally enforceable local hire requirements on the oil industry; with the exception of the toothless reporting requirements of pre-Northstar leases, there are no such laws.
Furthermore, I don't consider the annual highlight on oil industry resident hire performance in the Nonresidents Working in Alaska publication, backed up by the individual reports on the local hire performance of all firms operating in Alaska "limited", though I will allow that the attention paid to these reports by the public and the legislature during the period of fast economic growth as we emerged from the 1986-1988 recession, particularly after the oil spill in 1989, was relatively scant and did, in all likelihood, lower the profile of the resident hire issue.
"Local hire efforts emerge from obscurity . . . discussions related to the Northstar lease-once again brought local hire issues to the attention of both State and industry officials.''
The resident hire initiatives of this administration, including those related to oil and gas, pre-dated the Northstar deliberations.
The first press release issued by my office in January of 1995 was one regarding the issuance of the Nonresidents Working in Alaska 1993.
At that time, this Department of Labor determined to take the local hire issue off the back burner, with an initial emphasis on the two industries which paid the most wages to non-residents (at markedly different wage rates) - seafood processing and oil and gas.
We made a conscious decision to begin our seafood employment initiative first, since any other industry questioned about its local hire always points to seafood and asks why nothing is done about that industry, and in fact little had been done in recent years to encourage resident hire in the industry which employed the largest number of non-resident workers.
Our discussions with the oil industry on the resident hire performance of major contractors in that industry were well underway by December of 1995, prior to the legislative deliberations on Northstar.
Those deliberations have, however, greatly improved the lease provisions on resident hire reporting for those leases, and the language requiring an annual report by DOL on all companies working on the North Slope for purposes of comparison with Northstar contractors should be particularly useful in promoting resident hire.
I agree that the Northstar amendment has had a salutary effect on industry awareness of the importance of resident hire, and I am cautiously optimistic that current efforts will result in marked improvement once the Northstar and other projects get going.
With regard to the "Recommendations" in your audit, I submit the following:
Recommendation No. 2
The Commissioner of the Department of Labor should improve measures to ensure that the Resident Hire Report provides the information required by Alaska Statute.
Although there is always more analysis and information that can be prepared, I feel the information contained in our annual report does fulfill our statutory obligation, and does so within our limited means.
The report presents a broad overview of the industries that hire large numbers and percentages of nonresident workers, the earnings of those nonresidents, and examines the number of unemployed Alaskans that are available for work in the state.
Although it is difficult to say in any single instance that an equally or better qualified Alaskan worker was unemployed and available to fill a job that was arbitrarily or intentionally filled by an employer with a non-resident worker, in aggregate the data provided supports the contention that large numbers of unemployed Alaska residents are being overlooked by some employers.
Our most recent report, Nonresidents Working in Alaska - 1995, has a discussion on pages 2 and 3 describing our view of the problem and some of the methods we have used to increase the hiring of Alaska residents, including training, hiring a seafood processing coordinator to facilitate the hiring of residents in the seafood processing industry, working with the oil industry as part of a task force designed to increase resident hire in that high-paying industry, working with Native organizations, and working with specific employers.
We also enforce resident hire laws relating to public-funded construction projects, the elimination of general funds specific to this purpose in 1989 notwithstanding.
In addition to the data presented in the annual resident hire report, we are constantly monitoring certain industries and individual firms on a quarterly basis in order to identify problems or improvements, and use that data in order to monitor and verify resident hire information provided by oil industry employers associated with the Northstar oil lease.
Is there room for improvement? Of course.
Next year, as a result of discussions within the administration and also with your audit team, our annual report will likely provide additional detailed information on occupations filled by nonresidents and resident workers displaced by nonresidents.
If you have specific additional suggestions for improvements to our annual report or data items you feel would assist the Alaska Legislature in a better understanding of the issue of resident hire in Alaska, we would welcome your ideas.
Recommendation No. 3
The DOL should use the statistical information from their Occupational Data Base (ODB) to analyze, monitor and provide feedback to major employers within the state and to assist with employment assistance and training efforts.
I view information as a powerful tool in increasing resident hire in Alaska.
Because we can shine a spotlight on individual firms, we can use the power of public opinion to assist us in encouraging employers to do what they should be doing in the first place.
This is one of our most powerful methods for increasing resident hire in Alaska, and we pursue it aggressively within time and budget constraints.
In addition to the annual resident hire report, we also publish an annual listing of the resident hire performance of all of Alaska's employers with twenty or more workers.
As mentioned above, we also prepare special lists of employers in the oil and seafood processing industries to assist us in our industry-specific resident hire efforts.
We do not currently contact individual employers across all industries based upon their resident hire performance, although most of the employers with the largest number of nonresidents are in the industries that we currently target.
During the coming year, I expect that we will make an extra effort to increase the number of firms that we work with in order to continue to increase the number of residents hired by Alaska's largest firms.
I appreciate the thoroughness of your audit and the courtesy which your audit team extended to my staff at all times.
Sincerely,
Tom Cashen Commissioner cc: John Shively, Commissioner, DNR Ed Flanagan, Deputy Commissioner, DOL Arbe Williams, Director, ASD, DOL Chris Miller, Chief, R

Randy S. Welker, Legislative Auditor Legislative Budget and Audit Committee Division of Legislative Audit P.O. Box 113300 Juneau, AK 99811-3300
Dear Mr. Welker:
Thank you for sending us a copy of your preliminary audit report for your management audit concerning Alaska hire reporting requirements.
While I can appreciate your desire for an accurate accounting of local hire in Alaska, I do not believe that recommendation No. 1, presented in the report, will do much to help reach your goal.
Placing local hire "reporting requirements" in the lease form serves little purpose.
The lease confers some exclusive rights to the lessee with respect to operations on the lease, but does not authorize the lessee to.
do any work on the lease without required local, state, and federal permits and approvals.
If no work is done during the lease term (often 7 years) then the lease reverts to the state.
Historically, only about 10% of the tracts leased are actually drilled.
Thus, for the majority of leases, no work is performed and local hire is not an issue.
For those leases that are drilled, when requests for permits and approvals are submitted before actually drilling, it may be useful to collect data since this is when work actually begins.
In fact, it is at that point that the division's permit and compliance reviews any such request for conformity with the relevant lease and its stipulations, including local hire provisions (if any).
The current lease form requires a lessee to detail the means by which the lessee will encourage the employment of Alaska residents and companies.
In formulating the proposal, the lease encourages the lessee to coordinate with the state's and local communities' employment services.
Moreover, the proposal must describe the lessee's plans for partnering with local communities to recruit and hire Alaskans and Alaska contractors.
(I note that your letter does not accurately quote the current lease's local hire provision.)
As I am sure you are aware, any requirement to hire Alaskans or Alaska contractors would likely be declared unconstitutional by the courts.
Your letter recommends that the division of oil and gas should " resume enforcement" of local hire reporting requirements in leases issued before 1984 and should incorporate reporting requirements in existing leases issued after 1984.
1 question whether implementing such recommendations will cause the industry to be any more "aware of their non-residential hire rates" or "take... action to improve those rates."
A legislative oversight hearing would seem to be a more effective means to accomplish your stated goals.
Regardless of the wisdom of the basis for your recommendations, implementing them would be a more effective means to accomplish your stated goals.
Regardless of the wisdom of the basis for your recommendations, implementing them would be problematic.
First, to my knowledge there is no consistent definition of what an "Alaska resident" is.
Different laws have different definitions which can begin with as little as 30 days residency.
Absent some standard, a lessee would be at a loss on how to report.
A lessee would need access to voting records, DMV records, PFD records, and the like.
I do not believe that all of those records are public.
Even with such access, it would not easy for the division or a lessee to know what standards to use for resident hire and on what basis to decide a lessee has (or has not) fulfilled its "requirements."
If a lessee has not met its "requirement" (assuming that could be determined) what action is to be taken? There is nothing in current law that prescribes any action.
Second, although the division could put a reporting requirement in future leases, it cannot put one in existing leases, which lacks one.
The division cannot unilaterally amend its contract with a lessee.
Third, even if all past and future leases contained the same reporting requirements, "enforcement" would be difficult, if not impossible, and burdensome to both the companies who would have to try to figure out who a real Alaskan is and Alaskans who would have to see if they kept documents such as old permanent fund stubs and used fishing licenses.
I am not aware of any statutory mandate that requires reporting requirements.
Thus I find enforcement to be something the division cannot, by law, do.
Unless and until some standards and consequences are established, I see little point in gathering deficient information.
The Legislature could pass a reporting requirement law setting forth the standards and the consequences of the failure to comply with them, if it thinks your recommendations have merit.
And once those standards and consequences are established, I believe it is the Department of Labor, not the Division of Oil and Gas, that should perform any statistical evaluation and take the lead in any enforcement activity.
You might be interested to know that we are working on this issue as part of the activities of the Governor's Gas Commercialization Team.
Thank you for giving an opportunity to share our thoughts with you.
Sincerely,
John T. Shively Commissioner cc: Tom Cashen, Commissioner, Department of Labor Ken Boyd, Director, DNR/Division of Oil and Gas Carol Carroll, Director, DNR/Support Services __________________________________________________________________
LEGISLATIVE AUDITOR'S ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
November 14, 1997
Members of the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee:
We have reviewed the audit responses from the Departments of Labor (DOL) and Natural Resources (DNR).
As a result of those responses, we wish to clarify our positions on several items.
In our Report Conclusions, we discuss a correlation between lack of state enforcement of local hire requirements and an increase in nonresident hire.
We neither said, nor meant to imply, as suggested by DOL's response, that legally enforceable local hire requirements exist.
In recognition that local hire requirements have not survived legal challenges, our Background Information section contains a lengthy discussion of Alaska Hire provisions that have been overturned by the courts.
While we recognize that there are no legally enforceable requirements for local hire, we disagree with DNR's position that no improvement in this area can be effected without statutory authority.
In our Report Conclusions section, we note that the Northstar amendment, which includes only language encouraging local hire and requiring certain local hire reports, has inspired the oil industry to increase local hire.
DOL, in their response, appears to concur with this conclusion: ". . .the Northstar amendment has had a salutary effect on industry awareness of the importance of resident hire. . ."
In our view, the industry's increased awareness of local hire issues is a step in the right direction.
We believe that this heightened industry awareness combined with consistent state agency attention can positively impact local hire statistics without actual local hire statutory mandates.
We do not disagree with DNR's observation that local hire reporting requirements in leases may have limited value if not also included at the permitting phase.
Accordingly, our recommendation to DNR reads: The Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources should ensure that lease provisions related to reporting on resident hire are enforced in old leases and included in new leases and permits.
This recommendation was not intended to imply that DNR should attempt to insert local hire provisions into leases that lack such a provision, but that leases and permits negotiated in the future should contain such a provision.
As discussed further in the recommendation, we view the incorporation of these provisions into new leases and permits as an effective method to ensure industry awareness and convey to the industry the importance of local hire issues.
In a discussion of requirements contained in the current lease form, DNR parenthetically notes that the current lease provision is not accurately quoted in our report.
As mentioned in our Findings and Recommendations section, we requested from the Division of Oil and Gas (DOG) a copy of the most recent lease agreement.
The lease agreement provided by DOG, a portion of which is attached, is quoted verbatim in our report.
DNR additionally comments that there is no consistent definition of what an Alaskan resident is.
As discussed in the Background Information section of our report, a definition of resident that is mutually acceptable to both the state and the oil industry has been negotiated through the efforts of the Governor's Joint State-Industry Working Group on Local Hire.
This definition will be used for future measurements of local hire on Northstar projects.
DNR suggests that monitoring of compliance with local hire lease provisions should be the responsibility of the Department of Labor.
We believe, as stated in the Findings and Recommendations section of the report, that DNR should be responsible for the enforcement of resident reporting requirements contained in leases.
As the agency that drafts, negotiates and maintains leases, DNR appears to us to be the state agency best suited for this responsibility.
Pat Davidson, CPA Acting Legislative Auditor
Attachment
