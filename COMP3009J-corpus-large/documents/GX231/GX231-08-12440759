Appendices Appendices 219 Appendices 220 Appendix A APPENDIX A Detailed Description of the Action Alternatives This appendix describes the action alternatives in detail.
Each alternative is described in terms of the goals, objectives, actions, guidelines, and mitigation measures.
The terms, "goals", "objectives", and "guidelines" have the specific meanings, as defined in the BLM Planning Handbook: goal: a broad statement of a desired outcome.
Goals are usually not quantifiable and may not have established time frames for achievement.
objective: a description of a desired condition for a resource.
Objectives can be quantified and measured and, where possible, have established time frames for achievement.
guidelines: actions or management practices that may be used to achieve desired outcomes, sometimes expressed as best management practices.
(BLM Handbook H-1601-1, Appendix A; available online: http://www.blm.gov/nhp/efoia/ wo/handbook/h1601-1.pdf ).
The goals are the same for each alternative: they are the three purposes of the action defined in Chapter 1 of this EIS.
The objectives are the heart of the alternatives and vary considerably among the alternatives.
Each alternatives set of objectives represents a different way of achieving the same set of goals.
The "actions" are the specific management actions that would be taken to achieve a specific objectives.
The guidelines are intended to be advisory rather than absolute in nature.
For some actions, specific "mitigations measures" are presented to make the effect of the action less harsh or severe.

APPENDIX B Forest Modeling And The Landscape Management System (LMS) Introduction In order to evaluate the consequences of silvicultural actions, we projected the forest landscape forward in time.
We had to strike a balance between the precision of the modeling and the scope of the analysis, because of the large size of the landscape, the variety of conditions existing upon that landscape, and the variety of treatments analyzed.
For each step in the modeling, we invoked simplifying assumptions to prevent the analysis from expanding beyond a manageable size.
The major steps in the modeling include: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· establishing the starting condition; developing the treatment pathways; projecting the landscape forward in time using a stand growth model; summarizing the results across the landscape; and evaluating the results against criteria.
Establishment of the Starting Condition Available Data The Eugene District maintains a Geographic Information System (GIS) which, along with the Forest Operations Inventory (FOI), identifies the location and attributes such as age and stand type for each stand in the planning area.
The District also maintains the MICRO*STORMS data base, which records the treatment history for all managed stands.
These three geographically-based systems are connected through a unique number Â­ the FOI polygon number Â­ which identifies each forest stand.
This FOI polygon number and the attributes ascribed to it form the basis of all summary numbers, such as acres of an age-class, acres which have been planted, etc.
The starting acres and later stratifications of these acres are all calculated from summaries or intersections of these polygons with various GIS themes, such as stream or road locations.
In addition to these main data systems which are used to develop the landscape application of the silvicultural treatments, various other data exist to assist in the analysis.
We used stand exam data, post-pre-commercial thinning exams, stocking exams, and timber sale cruise data to calibrate the analysis at various points.
Stratification
Once the FOI polygons and their acres were compiled by stand birthdate and treatment history (see Graph 45), we stratified the landscape into a series of 15 "type stands": a generalized stand condition for a given age class and its typical management history.
These type stands are surrogates for a group of age classes or birthdates.
Reduction of the multitude of stand ages into a smaller set of type stands keeps the application of the treatments to a manageable size.
The type stands selected for this analysis are 261
Appendix B shown in Table 9.
We selected the type stands specifically to narrow the groups for which stands are in a state of rapid structural change.
In managed Douglas-fir stands from about 20-60 years of age, tree diameters and heights change dramatically, and stands typically undergo extensive density-dependent mortality ("selfthinning").

Appendix B Finally, we split all type stands into 2 subgroups: uplands and riparian areas (
Riparian areas were identified based on the Eugene District Hydrological GIS theme.
Splitting FOI polygons into upland and riparian stands allowed the modeling of different treatment prescriptions in upland and riparian areas.
Starting inventories
We developed starting stand inventories for type stands 80 years old using the FVS stand modeler and the typical stand treatment histories.
We averaged stand age within the range of the stand type (see Table 9) and assumed the treatment history to be that which was predominant at the time, from the MICRO*STORMS database.
We assumed that stands were pre-commercially thinned, with the following exceptions.
The DF10 (i.e., 10-year old type stand) has not yet been pre-commercially thinned.
We split the DF15 into pre-commercially thinned and non-pre-commercially thinned stands to reflect that pre-commercial thinning is currently underway in this age class.
We split the DF40 into pre-commercially thinned and non-pre-commercially thinned stands because a substantial portion of stands in that age-class were not pre-commercial thinned because of inadequate funding.
We developed starting stand inventories for type stands 
The stands 80 years old in the planning area are generally high density, uniform in structure, and dominated by Douglas-fir.
Although hardwood stands are present in the planning area, they are generally confined to the immediate riparian areas of larger streams and comprise less than 4% of all typed stands.
Simplifying this forest landscape into a series of 15 type stands with a single starting inventory for each type stand permits the modeling of change to forests over time across a large landscape under multiple alternatives.
The starting stand inventories we used appear to slightly underestimate tree diameter and height.
BLM is currently conducting a series of stand examinations in and near the planning area, to evaluate the starting stand inventories.
Development of the Silvicultural Pathways For each alternative, we developed silvicultural pathways which applied the treatments to appropriate type stands.
These silvicultural pathways include both treatments within the 10-year plan period, and subsequent treatments which would occur until the stands are 
See Figure 1 for an example of a treatment pathway.
Treatments include thinning, underplanting, falling trees for course woody debris, and killing trees for snags.
Figure 63 263
Appendix B A number of simplifying assumptions were necessary to prevent an unmanageable proliferation of pathways.
First, we averaged thinning prescriptions that specified a range of tree densities (e.g., 50 - 70 TPA was modeled as 60 TPA).
Second, we applied treatments at no less than 5-year intervals, which coincides with the minimum time increment of the stand model.
Third, the analysis assumes that there would be no natural establishment of new trees.
Fourth, the analysis does not provide for natural disturbance events, such as fires or windstorms.
There are two important limitations of the modeling with regard to the silvicultural pathways.
First, the model applies thinning evenly at the indicated density, even though several alternatives in the analysis specify variable spacing.
There are no comparable stand models available which can model thinning in a spatially explicit manner.
Therefore the changes in point-to-point density in spatially variable treatments have to be inferred from the overall stand data.
Second, the model does not include hardwoods.
Bigleaf maple in particular is likely to be an important component of stands in the planning areas under many of the treatments.
However, the development of bigleaf maple within Douglas-fir stands in this planning area is likely to approximate the development of western hemlock, which can function as a surrogate for bigleaf maple development in the modeling results.
Projection of the Landscape This analysis uses the Landscape Management System (LMS) to project the initial starting conditions through the silvicultural pathways into the future.
LMS is being developed as part of the Landscape Management Project at the Silviculture Laboratory, College of Forest Resources, University of Washington.
The LMS model itself and additional information about LMS is available online at http://lms.cfr.washington.edu/ lms.html.
LMS is an assemblage of programs and interfaces, in which the user enters starting inventories, selects a growth model, enters the silvicultural pathways into a scenario, and establishes an analytical period.
LMS supports a number of variants of the U.S. Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) and the BLM Organon growth simulator.
For this analysis, we selected the Western Cascade variant of FVS.
The minimum time increment used for the modeling in this analysis is 5 years, with 20 total increments (including time 0).
As a result, the overall analysis period is 95 years, which is approximated to 100 years in the effects analysis.
The analysis defines the year 2002 as time 0: the beginning of the analysis period.
Although a longer analytical period might have revealed additional development of late-successional characteristics, especially among the youngest stands, it was too difficult to evaluate the reliability of the growth model or calibrate the results against empirical data beyond 100 years.
LMS, and the FVS model within it, are coupled to an output interface which prepares stand-level information such as relative density, basal area, quadratic mean diameter, and other commonly used stand-level statistics.
In addition, the user can access individual stand inventory projections.
These outputs can then be compared to empirical data to confirm the models projections and allow calibration through adjustments to the growth model.
In the FVS model, this is done through use of a keyfile which modifies the growth rates, mortality rates, etc.
The LMS program also interfaces to the embedded Stand Visualization System (SVS) program, which provides a visualization of the stand condition based on the stand inventory data.
For this analysis, we conducted a number of trial runs using the LMS program.
Comparing modeling results with local, empirical stand data indicated that the default levels of the FVS program were allowing growth rates that were too high at high stand densities.
In particular, stand relative densities were maintained at levels higher than 264
Appendix B generally observed in real stands: many trajectories reached relative densities of 90.
Therefore, the model was calibrated by reducing the maximum level the Stand Density Index by 10%.
This lowered the maximum allowable stand density and increased mortality levels as stands approached high densities.
The maximum allowable stand basal area was also reduced to 350 square feet/acre, which also slowed growth at very high stand densities.
These changes improved the performance of the model, causing the relative densities of the stands to limit out between 55 and 65, between the zone of imminent mortality and "normality" Â­ the maximum density usually seen in natural stands.
Also, the modeled stands were very similar to empirical data on similar-aged, singlecohort natural stands in volume, basal area, trees per acre, quadratic mean diameter, and relative density.
This favorable comparison suggests that the model is performing satisfactorily for the untreated stands, though perhaps still slightly overestimating growth rates in high density stands.
We made two changes to the default LMS output metrics, which improved our ability to evaluate the results against current research and the existing watershed analysis and LSR Assessment.
First, the default metric for height:diameter ratio measured the average height:diameter ratio of the biggest 100 trees.
Many of the proposed treatments would lower overstory density well below 100 TPA, which allowed small, underplanted trees to skew the overall stand height:diameter ratio.
Therefore, we changed this measurement to the average height:diameter ratio of all Douglas-fir trees 
Second, the default metric for canopy cover excluded canopy contribution of overlapping tree crowns, which grossly underestimated canopy cover percentages for moderate stand densities compared to local experience and the estimate in the LSR Assessment (p. 40).
We changed this measurement to count the contribution of overlapping crowns to canopy cover.
This method still appears to underestimate canopy cover at moderate stand densities, but is within approximately 10% of expected values.
This continuing slight underestimation of canopy cover may be resulting from the model slightly underestimating mean crown width, which we will calibrate if necessary based on the results of ongoing stand examinations.
Note that this method allows the canopy cover in high density stands to exceed 100% because of the contribution of overlapping crowns.
Summarizing the Results Across the Landscape The fundamental unit of the stand projection model in LMS is one acre.
The Toggle Program, an adjunct to LMS, was used to expand these one-acre projections to the landscape level.
The Toggle Program takes the outputs from LMS, adds up the available acreage for each pathway, and summarizes the conditions across the landscape.
Evaluation of Results The results tabulated for the projections across the landscape were compared against thresholds for various issues in the analysis, such as late-successional forest structural characteristics, marbled murrelet habitat, and northern spotted owl habitat.
The Toggle Program queries the output of LMS and determines which pathways and which acres meet the thresholds over time.
For this analysis, those stands 
Therefore, acres of stands currently

APPENDIX C Local Late-successional Forest Characteristics We evaluated regional averages for late-successional forest characteristics (Spies and Franklin 1988; Spies and Franklin 1991; LSR Assessment, p. 57) against local data.
A recent study of BLM timber cruise data for timber sales in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the Eugene and Salem Districts evaluated late-successional forest characteristics (Poage 2001).
That data set consists of 91 timber sales or sale units for which the electronic data on the sale were still available.
That data set comprises a precise and accurate sample of the population of trees in sale areas of approximately 20-100 acres.
We examined that data set to derive the evaluation criteria for late-successional forest structural characteristics.
We extracted the portion of the data set which describes sales in the Coast Range within the Eugene District.
This subset totals 1,295 acres of stand data, constituting 24 sales or sale units.
From this sub-set of the Poage data set, we calculated the mean values and standard deviations of the parameters selected: density of very large Douglas-fir (
For most of these characteristics, we selected a threshold from the mean value minus one standard deviation.
However, for the density of shade-tolerant conifers, the standard deviation exceeds the mean value, which appears to be a consistent pattern throughout the larger data set as well (Poage 2001, p. 35).
For shade-tolerant conifers, we selected the threshold from the 66th percentile of sample values.
In addition, if both the CV of diameter and the shade-tolerant levels were met, the diameter was relaxed to 32" dbh.
Both of these methods of selecting the thresholds were intended to establish a threshold that represented the structural conditions of most late-successional forests, but not necessarily absolute minimum conditions found in all late-successional forests.
In addition, we have compiled a larger data set of over 4,000 acres, limited to sales within or immediately near the planning area.
This data set from the timber sale summaries is not as detailed or precise: it does not provides descriptions of all trees by sizes, but just by density levels of species at the overall timber sale level, which typically contained 1-6 sale units.

Appendix C Examination of this data set, which is limited to the planning area or immediate surrounding lands, will allow us to evaluate the applicability of the late-successional forest structural characteristics used in this analysis and might lead to refinement of the threshold levels.
Although this more local data set is not yet fully compiled, preliminary examination suggests that it is substantially similar to the Poage data set and will not lead to any substantial modifications of the late-successional forest structural characteristic thresholds in this analysis.

APPENDIX D Sedimentation Analysis Methodology Introduction Sedimentation occurring from forest practices within the planning area includes chronic delivery from road surface erosion, episodic delivery from landslides as a result of culvert failures during storm events, and temporary pulses of sediment during fish passage improvement projects, in-stream restoration projects, and new road construction.
The intent of the quantification of sedimentation is to evaluate the relative contribution of sediment that could potentially occur from each activity under the different alternatives.
Road Surface Erosion
The analysis of road-related sedimentation here differs slightly from the analysis in the Siuslaw Watershed Analysis because of refinements made to the modeling assumptions, made in part in response to the findings of the 2002 road inventory.
We estimated fine sediment delivery to the stream system by field observations as part of the 2002 road inventory, in which we inventoried all BLM-controlled roads in the planning area.
For purposes of calculating sedimentation, only road segments capable of delivering sediment to stream systems were identified for this analysis.
Of the total 65.96 miles of road inventoried, 24.84 miles are capable of contributing sediment to streams.
Using the Washington Standard Methodology for Conducting Watershed Analysis (WFPB 1995), we examined road segments for road prism characteristics and drainage deliverability.
We applied factors for differing conditions of the road tread, cut and fill slopes, and traffic use.
This analysis assumes average conditions: prism widths of cut slope (15), tread (9) and fill slope (10).
Because factors used in the Washington methodology were based on a combination of studies performed in the Idaho Batholith area and elsewhere, we made one deviation to the traffic factor to more accurately reflect the lithology of the planning area.
Deviation: We calibrated the deviation in the traffic factor for this analysis from unpublished research performed in southwestern Washington (Mack Creek in the Chehalis Headwaters), which is expected to more accurately reflect sediment yields for roads built on the lithology found in southwestern Washington (Sullivan and Duncan, 1980) and the Oregon Coast Range.
We multiplied the base erosion rate derived for each road segment in the watershed by a factor based on the level of traffic projected for that road segment over the next 5 years.
These factors are provided in the standard methodology for no traffic, light, moderate and heavy traffic levels (WFPB 1995).
Using the standard methodology, we varied the traffic factors until the results matched the field data for the same set of road segments at Mack Creek.
The calibration resulted in traffic factors that are approximately 1/10th of the standard WFPB methodology traffic factors (K. Sullivan and J. Clark, 1996, personal communication).
The analysis of sedimentation in the Siuslaw Watershed Analysis did not make this deviation to the traffic factor (USDI BLM 1996a, pp. II-1 - II-8, III-8).
If the total roadrelated sedimentation calculated in the watershed analysis were assumed to be evenly distributed across the watershed, the planning area portion of the total in the watershed analysis would be 299 cubic yards/year, as compared to the 108 cubic yards/year in our analysis here.
This difference is primarily resultant from the deviation in the traffic factor, which is consistent with the field observations in the 2002 road inventory of the planning area.
Also, our analysis here assumed that hauling of timber would be done primarily in the summer, in part because thinning operations in most alternatives would be seasonally limited by temporary roads (see Chapter 4 - Introduction).
269
Appendix D Furthermore, the 2002 road inventory estimated that the relative contributions to roadrelated sediment delivery in the planning area are 50% from the tread, 31% from the cutslope, and 4% from the fill-slope.
The Siuslaw Watershed Analysis assumed deliveries of 40% from the tread, 40% from the cut-slope, and 20% from the fill-slope.
Finally, of the 24.84 miles of road segments that the 2002 road inventory determined are capable of delivering sediment, approximately 11 miles are paved, and are therefore producing negligible sediment deliveries from the tread.
The 2002 road inventory has a high confidence level, because specialists drove each road segment and identified road prism characteristics.
Basic erosion rates established by various researchers reflect the erodibility rates for roads built in different geologic materials (WFPB 1995).
The planning area is dominantly composed of sedimentary geology.
The rate represents erosion from the bare road prism surfaces.
Road surfacing material determines the erodibility of the surface tread during traffic, particularly during heavy haul, and is adjusted according to the type and depth of surfacing material.
Typically, roads in the planning area are maintained with a lift of approximately 6" of compacted, fractured gravel, mostly mixed volcanics from local quarries.

Appendix D General confidence in assessing the sediment yields of road segments is moderate, although the confidence of the quality of the data collected during the road inventory is high.
It is uncertain whether the planning area soils more accurately reflect the western Washington unpublished study or the Idaho Batholith studies from which the Washington Watershed Analysis methods were originally derived.
The accuracy of the model reflects the quality of input information.
We evaluated the rate of sediment delivery from roads using a model that simplifies a complex road system.
Given the limitations in this simple model and the limitations in averaging road prism characteristics, any estimation errors would likely be uniformly applied to all inventoried roads and any errors in scale would not drastically change any of the analytical conclusions.
Landslides from Culvert Failures During the 2002 road inventory, we identified 73 culverts that are currently at risk of failure because they are undersized, plugged, currently failing, or poorly engineered (See Table 11).
That inventory found that approximately 57 miles of road have a high potential for culvert failure with delivery to streams.
Of that total, approximately 26 miles are paved and 31 miles are gravel/dirt.
We used only stream-crossing culverts for this quantification.
Calculating the sediment deliver to streams if these culverts were to fail required many simplifying assumptions.
We included only the amount of fill calculated to exist around each culvert, and did not attempt to estimate mass wasting from debris flows or any other catastrophic road drainage problem.
We assumed that an average width of road prism was 40, because this was most typical length of Siuslaw River BLM culverts (BLM oral communications, 2002); that an 18" culvert has a 4 active channel width, a 24" culvert has a 6 active channel width, a 32" culvert has a 7 active channel width, a 56" culvert has a 12 active channel width, and a 72" culvert has a 20 active channel width.
We estimated that the depth of fill * the active channel width * 1.5 (to account for the slope above the culvert failure) * the average road prism width would give an approximate estimate of how much sediment would be delivered to streams if all high-risk culverts were to fail.
Although few studies have been conducted to measure suspended sediment and stream discharge during culvert removals, some monitoring reports do exist.
Monitoring results from Quartz Creek, Montana revealed that different equipment operators affect the amount of sediment generated, but that overall in-stream effects are of short duration and do not affect beneficial uses (Wegner 1999).
Monitoring results from the Lolo National Forest, Montana, indicate that between 1 to 2 cubic yards were introduced into the stream during and after culvert removal (Lolo, 2000).
BLM personal communications, 2002, indicate that little sedimentation has been observed in the past during BLM culvert removals and replacement.
The Eugene District uses best management practices such as dewatering, straw bales, and numerous bio-engineering techniques, which reduce sediment production substantially.
To quantify sedimentation from culvert removal, we assumed that 1 cubic yard could potentially be delivered to the stream channel during culvert removal and replacement.
We assumed that we would remove or replace culverts at an even pace over a ten-year period.
