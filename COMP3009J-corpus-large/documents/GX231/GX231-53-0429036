The EPA has maintained that the potential risk to threatened and endangered species prevents the use of these baits for ground squirrel control.
Ground squirrels, commonly called gophers, are now emerging from winter hibernation and their digging and foraging activities can cause damage to many crops including pastures, alfalfa and small grains as well as damage to irrigation ditch banks.
The Department, extension agents and pesticide dealers receive questions each year from farmers, ranchers and other landowners about ground squirrel control measures and the use of strychnine rodenticides.
The EPA canceled the use of strychnine baits in 1989 because of the risk to threatened and endangered species, such as the bald eagle.
Ground squirrels killed by strychnine bait may retain the substance in their stomachs, which in turn may kill bald eagles or other animals that feed on ground squirrels.
Instead of strychnine, producers can use currently registered ground squirrel baits that include zinc phosphide oat baits and Rozol ground squirrel bait.
Strychnine baits are registered solely for control of pocket gophers, not ground squirrels, according to Dan Sullivan of the Vertebrate Pest Management Program for the Montana Department of Agriculture.
Peck requests the cooperation of landowners experiencing ground squirrel problems to use EPA registered products for the control of ground squirrels.
