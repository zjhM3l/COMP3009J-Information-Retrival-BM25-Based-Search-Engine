For Immediate Release PLIGHT OF THE KURDISH PEOPLE May 27, 1999 Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for the plight of the Kurdish people living in Northern Iraq and Eastern Turkey.
They have been victims of some of the most egregious human rights abuses in recent years including brutal military attack, random murder, and forced exile from their homes.
While American efforts in Northern Iraq have greatly improved the plight of the Kurds, there is certainly much room for improvement both there and in Turkey.
As is often the case, neither side in the dispute holds a monopoly on human rights abuses.
The PKK's actions unquestionably demand a response from the Turkish government.
Rather than a measured and targeted response, however, Turkey has declared a state of emergency in a large portion of Eastern Turkey, directly affecting more than 4 million of its citizens.
Under the state of emergency, Turkey has severely rationed food, leading to great hardship amongst innocent civilians.
In addition, Turkey has forced hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes, leaving more than 2,600 towns and villages mere ghost towns.
These actions are all aimed at suppressing the PKK's terrorism.
Yet, the government has actively targeted not only known terrorists but those believed to agree with the PKK's goal of independence--although perhaps not their methods--as well.
Even those who support neither the PKK's goals nor their means suffer at the hands of the Turkish military and police forces.
Thus, Turkey's Kurdish population is under attack from both sides without any place to hide.
Turkey is both a democracy and an important ally of the United States.
In Kosovo and Bosnia, Turkey has stood firmly with other NATO members against human rights abuses.
In recent weeks, Turkey has opened its borders to tens of thousands of innocent Kosovars desperate to escape Slobodan Milosevic's murderous rampage.
Turkey, along with our other NATO allies, deserves a great deal of credit for its principled stand in the Balkans.
In fact, Turkey has allowed the United States to enforce the no-fly zone over Northern Iraq from our air force base on Turkish soil.
Yet, it would be inappropriate for us to overlook Turkey's human rights abuses against its own people simply because of its commendable actions elsewhere.
Mr. President, the intentional murder of innocent non-combatants is an anathema to the United States regardless of where it occurs or who the perpetrator is.
Thus, the PKK's efforts to intimidate others by random murder, certainly not indicative of all Kurds, deserves our condemnation as does Turkey's abuse of its own innocent citizens in the pursuit of terrorists.
Mr. President, we must never let our nation's commitment to the protection of human rights lapse.
As we sit here today, the human rights of an entire race of people in Turkey and Iraq are under assault.
I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning these abuses.

This was certainly not Iraq's first deplorable attack on the Kurds and, sadly, it was not destined to be the last.
Yet, this attack continues to represent a stark milestone in the long list of deplorable deeds Saddam Hussein has perpetrated against his own people.
In recent years, however, the United States has come to the aid of the Kurds of Northern Iraq.
At the conclusion of the Gulf War, the United States and our allies established `no-fly' zones over Northern and Southern Iraq.
These zones, plus the damage the Iraqi military sustained during Operation Desert Storm, have mercifully curtailed Saddam Hussein's ability to attack the Kurds in Northern Iraq.
Mr. President, the men and women of the United States Air Force who risk Iraqi anti-aircraft fire over Iraq each day in order to enforce these no-fly zones deserve our support and commendation.
Not only do their efforts protect nations throughout the region and around the world from Saddam Hussein's aggression, but their daily flights serve as sentries against human rights abuses.
Mr. President, the United States has taken other, more direct actions to help the Kurds of Northern Iraq.
Following the Gulf War, the United States Agency for International Development worked to provide important humanitarian assistance to Iraqi Kurds.
When Iraqi incursions into the region once again threatened the lives of thousands of innocent civilians, the United States worked to evacuate more than 6,500 people to the safety of Guam.
Many were later granted asylum in the United States.
Our relationship with the Kurdish people of Northern Iraq is not a one-way street.
More than 2,000 of the Kurds who the United States evacuated in 1996 were either employees of American relief agencies or family members of those employees.
Others have provided invaluable intelligence information to the United States.
As I mentioned earlier, many Kurds also live in Eastern Turkey.
A minority of Turkish Kurds have taken up arms against the democratically elected Turkish government in a bid for independence.
Unfortunately, both sides in this internal conflict are guilty of human rights abuses against innocent Kurdish civilians.
The Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has devolved into a terrorist organization targeting not only Turkish military and police forces but innocent Kurdish civilians as well.
As is often the case, neither side in the dispute holds a monopoly on human rights abuses.
The PKK's actions unquestionably demand a response from the Turkish government.
Rather than a measured and targeted response, however, Turkey has declared a state of emergency in a large portion of Eastern Turkey, directly affecting more than 4 million of its citizens.
