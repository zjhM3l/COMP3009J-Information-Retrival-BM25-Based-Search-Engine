The ISRA endorsement came today after an announcement yesterday by the Naperville Police Department that it was formally endorsing the proposal.
"The Illinois State Rifle Association has hit the target with its endorsement of universal crime gun tracing," Durbin said.
"I thank the association for finally joining me in the fight to catch gun traffickers and straw purchasers."
"Now I challenge the ISRA to take another step to join me in the fight to ban the resale of military surplus .50 caliber bullets.
"I sincerely hope the ISRA does not support the sale to civilians of bullets that are capable of piercing armor at a range of up to four miles.
These bullets aren't for sportsmen or for home protection; they are the choice of terrorists, gangs, drug cartels and doomsday cults."
Since the Durbin/ATF initiative began in 1998, the number of crime guns traced in Illinois has risen by almost 300 percent.
"These numbers are encouraging, but we need to work with law enforcement agencies until Illinois becomes the first state in the nation to voluntarily trace every crime gun," he said.
