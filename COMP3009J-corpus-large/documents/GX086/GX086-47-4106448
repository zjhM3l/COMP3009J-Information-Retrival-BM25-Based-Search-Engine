TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ FEEDING BEHAVIOR OF THE RED AND GRAY SUNFLOWER SEED WEEVILS (COLEOPTERA: CURCULIONIDAE) ON CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS L Author(s): RANA RICO L CHARLET LAURENCE D Interpretive Summary: Knowing the basic requirements of sunflower seed weevils for survival and reproduction is an important step in managing populations of these insect pests.
Adult red and gray sunflower seed weevils use the sunflower plant for food and reproduction.
The purposes of this study were to determine the feeding site(s) and types of sunflower tissue consumed by adults and to determine the influence of cultivated sunflower growth stages on development of the female reproductive system.
Both male and female gray seed weevils fed more on leaves of sunflower and on disk flowers than on seeds.
Mature eggs developed when females were given access to plants in the bud stage.
Females feeding only on blooming sunflower heads did not develop mature eggs even after 12 days of feeding.
Most red seed weevil females fed on the seeds of sunflower disk flowers, while males fed on the corolla tubes of the disk flowers.
Females exposed to prebloom sunflower did not produce mature eggs, but did so when access was prolonged until plants were blooming.
Females confined in blooming heads developed mature eggs after four days.
Pollen stimulated egg production only when mixed with other foods such as ground sunflower seed, sucrose, or water.
The observed preference of sunflower seed weevils for a particular plant tissue, organ, or structure, and growth stage for feeding and reproduction is useful to consider in developing efficient control strategies for these pests.
