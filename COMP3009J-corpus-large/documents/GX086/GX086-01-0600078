Charlie Basss Capitol Link Linking Granite Staters to the Nations Capitol Vol. 2 No. 8 -- Week of March 26, 2001 __________________________________________________________________
Special Ed is Guaranteed a Significant Increase Budget also Pays Down Debt and Provides Tax Relief
The full House this week passed a federal spending plan, which includes a new and innovative provision that would guarantee a significant increase in federal assistance to states for special education.
Unlike an amendment I opposed, which did nothing to ensure funding, this ground-breaking provision would guarantee a $1.25 billion increase in federal funding for special education, which would immediately free up local resources to provide a quality education to all students.
The $1.25 billion is just part of an historic ten-year increase in education funding provided for by this budget, more of which could also be used to fund special education.
In addition to increasing federal funding for education, the Fiscal Year 2002 House Budget Resolution (H.Con.Res.
83), which passed the House 222-205, would pay down all available debt, set aside the Social Security surplus for retirement security, and strengthen Medicare by providing a prescription drug benefit.
Marriage Penalty and Family Tax Relief Wins Bipartisan Support
In New Hampshire, 139,673 married couples pay an average of $1,400 more in taxes simply because they are married.
It is wrong for our government to punish married working couples for no other reason than the decision to be married.
The Marriage Penalty and Family Tax Relief Act (H.R. 6), which passed the House 282-144 this week, would provide marriage penalty relief by doubling the standard deduction, expanding the 15% bracket, providing relief from the alternative minimum tax, and expanding eligibility for the earned income tax credit.
In addition to providing marriage penalty relief, this bill, which I cosponsored, would double the child tax credit from $500 to $1000.
By putting this money back in the pockets of parents, this bill would help them make ends meet or save for their childrens future.
An estimated 249,775 New Hampshire children would benefit from the increased child tax credit.
Hearing Examines Issues Raised by Human Cloning
Human cloning is a matter of great public concern.
The Energy and Commerce Committees Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, on which I sit, held a hearing this week to confront the safety, ethical, and moral issues raised by the possibility of human cloning.
Two groups that have recently announced efforts to clone humans were among those to testify at the hearing.
According to the Food and Drug Administration, any human cloning experiments in the United States must meet safety standards to win its approval.
Nevertheless, several opponents to the procedure want a federal law to ban cloning humans.
I am opposed to cloning humans.
I support the current ban on federal funding for research on human cloning.
Meanwhile, there are renewed efforts in Congress this year to introduce legislation to ban cloning.
Similar efforts in the past have failed to produce a bill.
During the hearing, several experts suggested a moratorium on cloning that could be revised in a few years.
Meeting the Needs of U.S. Veterans
Our nations veterans have demonstrated their commitment to this nation by serving in the U.S. military.
The House passed legislation this week with my strong support to help ensure that veterans receive the services they need and deserve.
The Veterans Opportunities Act (H.R. 801) would improve and expand veterans benefits.
Specifically, the bill would improve education assistance programs; expand transition assistance and outreach programs to departing service members and dependents; increase burial benefits; and provide for family life insurance coverage.
The Veterans Hospitals Emergency Repair Act (H.R. 811) would authorize funding for major medical facility construction projects and patient care projects that improve, replace, renovate, or update deteriorating facilities.
Both bills passed the House 417-15.
Quick Takes
The campaign finance reform debate appears to be headed to the House.
The Senate on Monday is expected to pass the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, which would ban soft money, strengthen disclosure requirements, and reduce the influence of special interests.
It has yet to be determined whether the House will consider the Senate bill, which has been amended to raise hard money contribution limits, or the companion House bill, Shays-Meehan, which I cosponsored.
I am hopeful the House will pass legislation that reduces the influence of big money and special interests in campaigns and strengthens the voices of voters and candidates in their own races.
With two components of President Bushs tax relief package through the House, we will consider next week a third measure, the death tax.
The House Ways and Means Committee passed this week, 24-14, legislation to repeal the estate tax.
The Dunn-Tanner Death Tax Elimination Act (H.R.8) would phase down rates and repeal the federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer taxes within 10 years.
It has long been my position that the death tax is unfair.
Farmers and small business owners pay taxes throughout their lifetime.
It is wrong for the federal government to force them to pay up to 55% of their savings, their business, or their farm in taxes when they die.
