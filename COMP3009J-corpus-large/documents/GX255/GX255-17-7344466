SAMPLE AUDITOR'S REPORT (for reserve report)
To the Board of Directors (Name of Provider) We have audited the accompanying continuing care reserve report of "Provider" as of "Date".
The continuing care reserve report is the responsibility of "Provider's" management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the continuing care reserve report based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the continuing care reserve report is free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the continuing care reserve report.
An audit of a continuing care reserve report also includes assessing the conformity with the provisions of California Health and Safety Code section 1792 in so far as they relate to accounting and reporting matters.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such continuing care reserve report presents fairly, in all material respects, the continuing care reserve requirements of "Provider" at "Date", in conformity with the report preparation provisions of California Health and Safety Code section 1792.
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the board of directors and management of "Provider" and for filing with the California Department of Social Services and should not be used for any other purposes.
However, this report is a matter of public record and its distribution is not limited.

PART 5 LIQUID RESERVES I. GENERAL INFORMATION THE LIQUID RESERVE REQUIREMENT Each provider that has executed a continuing care contract or assumed obligations under a continuing care contract must maintain a liquid reserve.
To maintain a liquid reserve, a provider is required to hold a certain amount or value of "qualifying assets".
The provider is not required to restrict, place into escrow, or set aside the qualifying assets it designates as its liquid reserve.
The Department may under certain circumstances, however, require a provider to place the liquid reserve into an escrow.
REQUIRED AMOUNT The amount a provider must hold as a liquid reserve is the sum of two amounts.
The first is the amount that the provider must hold to cover its long-term debt service.
This amount is referred to as a "debt service reserve" in the continuing care contract statutes.
The second amount is the amount the provider must hold to cover 45 days net operating expenses.
The continuing care contract statutes refer to this amount as the "operating expense reserve".
The debt service reserve and operating expense reserve amounts are calculated using Forms 5-1 through 5-4.
ANNUAL REPORT All figures for the reserve calculations must be taken from the provider's annual audited financial statements for its most recently completed fiscal year.
Forms 5-1 through 5-5 must be filed by the provider as part of its annual report.
The debt service reserve and operating expense reserve amounts determined on Forms 5-3 and 5-4 are then transferred to Form 5-5.
Each provider must submit a Form 5-5 with its annual report to show the amount it must hold in liquid reserve for the next 12 months.
QUARTERLY REPORT Providers must also file a Form 5-Q within 45 days following the end of each quarter during the provider's fiscal year.
The first Form 5-Q is required 15 days after the provider's annual report.
Form 5-Q shows the total amount that a provider must hold as its liquid reserve and identifies the qualified assets designated by the provider to satisfy the liquid reserve requirement.
NOTE: The qualifying assets designated by the provider to be its liquid reserve may not be subject to any liens, charges, judgments, garnishments, or creditors' claims and may not be hypothecated, pledged as collateral, or otherwise encumbered in any manner.
The only exception to this rule is that a provider may allow the qualifying assets designated as its liquid reserve to be subject to a general security pledge of assets or similar collateralization agreement that is part of the provider's long-term capital debt covenants and is included in the provider's long-term debt indenture or similar instrument.
SPECIAL RULE FOR INACTIVE PROVIDERS Providers who have voluntarily and permanently discontinued entering into continuing care contracts may apply to the Department to reduce the amount they must hold in their liquid reserve.
If approved by the Department, the reduced liquid reserve amount shall be based upon the percentage of the provider's residents who have continuing care contracts.
9
NOTE: All figures entered on these forms must reconcile directly with the financial statements.
If supporting schedules are used, a two-way reconciliation must be submitted in which the forms reconcile to the schedules and the schedules reconcile to the financial statements.
If reconciliation schedules are not provided, the annual report will be considered incomplete and may result in late fees (see note on page 1).

Form 5-2 calculates a statutorily defined estimate of the annual debt service for new long-term debt (incurred during the fiscal year).
