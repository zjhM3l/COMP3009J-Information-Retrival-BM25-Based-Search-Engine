R105-1-3.
Scope.
A.
This rule applies to the procurement and appointment by the Attorney General of outside legal counsel, expert witnesses and providers of litigation support services.
B.
The rule takes into account the special nature of the purposes for which outside counsel, expert witnesses and providers of litigation support services will often be retained, i.e., litigation, enforcement proceedings or investigations.
Legal strategy often requires that a potential plaintiff or defendant not be given any notice of anticipated litigation, or that a party is considering calling expert witnesses; and enforcement proceedings and actions leading to enforcement proceedings are often delicate, with agencies and defendants concerned that in order to prevent undue harm to reputations, the public should not be made aware of any proceedings until preliminary actions have been completed.
To enable the Attorney General to have the flexibility needed to provide outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services in instances where obtaining those services through a publicized solicitation could interfere with legal strategies or could disclose information prematurely, the rule specifically authorizes the Attorney General to determine, pursuant to Utah Code Ann.
Sec. 63-56-24 (1986), that an emergency exists that would pose a threat to the public health, welfare or safety were the Attorney General publicly to disclose, through a request for proposals, information which would otherwise be necessary for a person to submit a proposal or were the Attorney General to delay procuring those services because of the time constraints imposed by the usual procurement procedures for those services.
The rule does provide that even in those "emergency" situations, however, the Attorney General will make the selection with as much competition as practicable under the circumstances.
C.
The rule also provides that the Attorney General will select outside counsel, expert witnesses and providers of litigation support services pursuant to competitive sealed proposals, rather than competitive sealed bids, whenever the Attorney General does not make those selections through the small purchase, sole source, or emergency provisions of this rule.
R105-1-4.
Determination of Small Purchase, Sole Source, Emergency, or Waiver of Request for Proposals.
A.
If the Attorney General determines it is necessary to retain outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation UAC (As of November 1, 2001) Printed: January 4, 2002 Page 33 support services, the Attorney General may first determine whether the retention of outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services can be made under provisions of this rule for: 1.
Small purchases pursuant to section R105-1-7.
2.
Sole source providers pursuant to section R105-1-10.
3.
Emergencies pursuant to section R105-1-9.
4.
Waiver for request for proposals pursuant to section R105-1-10.
B. After the determination under subsection R105-1-4A of this rule has been made, the Attorney General shall proceed to select outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services pursuant to the applicable provisions of this rule.
R105-1-5.
Use of Competitive Sealed Proposals in Lieu of Competitive Sealed Bids.
Projects for which outside counsel, expert witnesses, or providers of litigation support services are obtained are usually unique, and the person submitting the lowest proposed fee might not be the best person to provide the needed service for that particular project.
As a result, it is not practicable or advantageous to the State or its agencies for the Attorney General to obtain the services of outside counsel, expert witnesses, or providers of litigation support services through competitive sealed bids.
Thus, whenever the Attorney General selects outside counsel, expert witnesses, or providers of litigation support services under this rule, the Attorney General will request and receive competitive sealed proposals, rather than competitive sealed bids.
R105-1-6.
Selection of Outside Counsel, Expert Witnesses and Providers of Litigation Support Services Other than through Small Purchase, Sole Source, or Emergency, or Waiver of Request for Proposals Provisions.
A.
If the Attorney General determines the retention of outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services may not be made under sections R105-1-7, R105-1-8, R105-1-9, or Rule R105-1-10 of this rule, the Attorney General shall proceed under this section.
B.
The Attorney General shall prepare a request for proposals ("RFP"), to serve as outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services.
The RFP shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 1.
If the RFP is for outside counsel, the name of the agency, if any, for which outside counsel is sought.
2.
The nature of the project.
3.
The anticipated number of hours that will be required, the beginning date, and the date the project is expected to be completed.
If unknown or irrelevant, the RFP shall so state.
4.
The number of attorneys, law firms, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services that will be retained.
5.
Whether there is a preference or requirement as to how services are to be billed, e.g., payment will be made from a maximum amount against which fees can be billed on an hourly basis, or through a lump sum for the entire project, or through a contingent fee arrangement, or through a set hourly fee.
6.
Whether proposals will be accepted from law firms, associations of attorneys or law firms, or associations of expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services.
7.
The criteria under which the proposals will be evaluated.
The RFP will state the criteria in the order of importance in which the proposals will be evaluated, and the RFP will explicitly state that the criteria are listed in the order in which the proposals will be evaluated.
8.
Examples of criteria include, but are not limited to: a.
Experience of the applicant attorney, law firm, or expert witness or provider of litigation support services on the type of project for which the RFP is issued.
b.
If the RFP is for outside counsel, and the applicant is a law firm, each attorney in the firm that will be assigned to the project, and the experience on the type of project for which the RFP is issued of each attorney in the firm that will be assigned to the project.
c. Whether the applicant attorney, law firm, or expert witness or provider of litigation support services may associate himself or herself with other attorneys, law firms, expert witnesses, providers of litigation support services, or whether the Attorney General will require association.
If the Attorney General requires association, a specification of who the attorney, law firm, expert witness, or provider of litigation support services will be what experience each has in projects of the type for which the RFP was issued, what each will contribute to the project, and the percentage of the project that will be performed by each. d.
Any potential conflicts in providing the services on the project or projects for which the RFP is issued.
e.
The fee to be charged, and how it will be determined, e.g., hourly rate, hourly rate with minimum fee, hourly rate with maximum fee, lump sum payment.
If the attorney, law firm, expert witness, or provider of litigation support services intends to associate with other attorneys, law firms, expert witnesses, or provider of litigation support services, the proposal should state whether the fees and costs quoted include those of the associated attorney, law firm, expert witness or provider of litigation support services, and, regardless of whether the proposal does or does not include their fees and costs, what their fees and costs would be expected to be for the project.
9.

Exclusions and Limitations in Advertisement.
A.
It is a deceptive act or practice for a supplier in connection with a consumer transaction, in the sale or offering for sale of a consumer commodity to make any offer in written or printed advertising or promotional literature without stating clearly and conspicuously in close proximity to the words stating the offer of any material exclusions, reservations, limitations, modifications, or conditions.
The following are examples of the types of material exclusions, reservations, limitations, modifications, or conditions of offers which must be clearly stated: (1) An advertisement for any consumer commodity not disclosing the amount of any additional charge for any of the features displayed or listed in the advertisement would be deceptive.
(2) An advertisement for an article of clothing must state that there is an additional charge for sizes above or below a certain size if such is the case.
(3) An advertisement which offers floor covering with an additional charge for room sizes above or below a certain size must disclose the nature and amount of additional charge.
(4) An advertisement for a consumer commodity sold from more than one outlet under the direct control of the supplier causing the advertisement to be made must state: (a) Which outlets within the area served by the publication in which the advertisement appears either have or do not have certain features mentioned in the advertisement; (b) Which outlets within the area served by the publication in which the advertisement appears charge rates higher than the rate mentioned in advertisement.
For example: U67G@ Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½StÃ¯Â¿Â½TuhrÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ $Ã¯Â¿Â½hÃ¯Â¿Â½qhÃ¯Â¿Â½h Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½XrÃ¯Â¿Â½"qÃ¯Â¿Â½TrrÃ¯Â¿Â½TuÃ¯Â¿Â½PssvprÃ¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½hyyÃ¯Â¿Â½urÃ¯Â¿Â½yphvÃ¯Â¿Â½hrÃ¯Â¿Â½rÃ¯Â¿Â½ (c) An advertisement for a consumer commodity sold from outlets not under the direct control of the supplier causing the advertisement to be made does not violate Section 2a(4)(a) or 2a(4)(b) of this rule if it states that the consumer commodity is available only at participating independent dealers.
(5) An advertisement for any consumer commodity requiring installation must reflect the exact price of the commodity and if the price includes installation or if installation is additional.
(6) If the advertised price is available only during certain hours of the day or certain days of the week that fact must be stated along with the hours and days the price is available.
(7) If the advertisement involves or pictures more than one consumer commodity (for example: a sofa, cocktail table and two commodes) and the advertised price applies only if the complete set is purchased, that fact must be stated.
(8) If there is a minimum amount (or maximum amount) that must be purchased for the advertised price to apply, that fact must be stated.
(9) If an advertisement specifies a price for a consumer commodity which includes a trade-in, that fact must be stated.
For example: a 6 volt battery for $50.00 plus your old battery.
(10) If there are "additional" items that must be purchased for the advertised price to apply that fact must be so stated.
(11) These examples are intended to be illustrative only and do not limit the scope of any section of the Utah Consumer Sales Practices Act or of this or any other rule or regulation.
UAC (As of November 1, 2001) Printed: January 4, 2002 Page 47 B. Offers made orally, such as through radio or television advertising, must include a conspicuously clear and oral statement o f an y material exclu sio n s, reservations, modifications, or conditions.
C.
If an error is made in advertising, either by pricing, wording, picture, or description, it shall be the responsibility of the supplier to retract or correct the error.
A retraction is necessary when it cannot be shown that the error was due to the fault of the advertising medium.
If it can be documented that the responsibility rests with the advertising medium, a retraction by the supplier is not necessary but the supplier may post a correction in close proximity to the merchandise which was advertised incorrectly.
R152-11-3.
Bait Advertising/Unavailability of Goods.
A. Definitions: For the purposes of this rule, the following definitions shall apply: (1) "Raincheck" means a written document evidencing a consumer's entitlement to purchase advertised items at an advertised price within the time limits set forth in paragraph d. of this rule.
(2) "Salesperson" means the supplier or his agent or employee who interacts personally or directly with a consumer in negotiating or effecting a consumer transaction.
B.
It shall be a deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction for a supplier to offer to sell consumer commodities when the offer is not a bona fide effort to sell the advertised consumer commodities.
An offer is not bona fide if: (1) A supplier uses a statement or illustration in any advertisement which would create in the mind of a reasonable consumer a false impression of the grade, quality, quantity, make, value, model, year, size, color, usability, or origin of the consumer co mmodities offered or which otherwise misrepresents the consumer commodities in such a manner that, on subsequent disclosure or discovery of the true facts, the consumer is diverted from the advertised consumer commodities to other consumer commodities.
An offer is not bona fide, even though the true facts are made known to the consumer before he views the advertised consumer commodities, if the first contact or interview is secured by deception.
(2) A supplier discourages the purchase of the advertised consumer commodities in order to sell other consumer commodities.
This does not however, prohibit the good faith recommendation concerning a different consumer commodity as it relates to a consumer's particular or unique needs or problems concerning the consumer commodity.
The following are examples of acts or practices which raise a presumption that an offer to sell consumer commodities is not bona fide: (a) Refusal to show, demonstrate, or sell the consumer commodities advertised in accordance with the terms of the advertisement; (b) Disparagement by the supplier either by acts or words of the advertised consumer commodities or of the guarantee, credit terms, availability of service, repairs, or parts, or any other respects of the consumer commodities; (c) The failure of a supplier to have available at all outlets under its direct control, or listed in the advertisement, a sufficient quantity of the advertised consumer commodities at the advertised price to meet reasonably anticipated demands, unless the advertisement clearly and adequately disclosed that there is a limited quantity of advertised consumer commodities available and/or that the consumer commodities are available only at the designated outlets; (d) The failure to give rainchecks to consumers where the advertisement does not disclose that there is a limited quantity or availability of consumer commodities.
Suppliers who clearly and consistently post a raincheck policy for public review shall be exempt from this section; (e) The showing or demonstrating of defective, unusable, or impractical consumer commodities when such defective, unusable, or impractical nature is not fairly and adequately disclosed in the advertisement; (f) The use of a sales plan or method of compensation for salesperson designed to prevent or discourage them from selling the advertised consumer commodity.
This does not, however, prohibit the usual and reasonable use of commissions as a means of compensation; (g) The demonstration of an advertised consumer commodity in such a manner that makes the commodity appear inferior.
(3) A supplier, in the event of a sale to the consumer of the offered consumer commodities, attempts to persuade a consumer to repudiate the purchase of the offered commodities and purchase other consumer commodities in their stead, by any means, including but not limited to the following: (a) Accepting a consideration for the offered consumer commodities and then switching the consumer to other commodities; (b) Delivering offered consumer commodities which are unusable or impractical for the purposes represented or materially different from the offered consumer commodities.
The purchase on the part of some consumers of the offered consumer commodities is not in itself prima facie evidence that the offer is bona fide. (4) A supplier represents in any advertisement, which would create in the mind of the consumer, a false impression that the offer of goods has been occasioned by a financial or natural catastrophe when such is not true.
(5) A supplier misrepresents the former price, savings, quality or ownership of any goods sold.
R152-11-4.
Use of the Word "Free" etc.
A.
It shall be a deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction for a supplier to use the word "free" or other words of similar import or meaning, except when such representation is, in fact, the case and the cost of the "free" consumer commodity is not passed on to the consumer by raising the regular price of the consumer commodity that must be purchased in connection w

A finding by a licensed laboratory that a test sample taken from a horse contains a drug or its metabolites or analog, or any substance foreign to the natural horse shall be prima facie evidence that such has been administered to the horse either internally or externally in violation of these rules.
It is presumed that the sample of urine, saliva, blood or other acceptable specimen tested by the approved laboratory to which it is sent is taken from the horse in question; its integrity is preserved; that all procedures of same collection and preservation, transfer to the laboratory, and analyses of the sample are correct and accurate; and that the report received from the laboratory pertains to the sample taken from the horse in question and correctly reflects the condition of the horse during the race in which he was entered, with the burden on the trainer, assistant trainer or other responsible party to prove otherwise at any hearing in regard to the matter conducted by the stewards or the Commission.
7.
Intent Of Medication Rules.
It shall be the intent of these rules to protect the integrity of horse racing, to guard the UAC (As of November 1, 2001) Printed: January 4, 2002 Page 19 health of the horse, and to safeguard the interests of the public and the racing participants through the prohibition or control of all drugs, medication, and substances foreign to the natural horse.
8.

Samples shall be sent to racing laboratories approved and designated by the Commission, in such manner as the Commission or its designee may direct.
All required samples shall be in the custody of the official veterinarian, his/her assistants or other persons approved by the official veterinarian from the time they are taken until they are delivered for shipment to the testing laboratory.
No person shall tamper with, adulterate, add to, break the seal of, remove or otherwise attempt to so alter or violate any sample required to be taken by this Article, except for the addition of preservatives or substances necessarily added by the Commission-approved laboratory for preservation of the sample or in the process of analysis.
The Commission has the authority to direct the approved laboratory to retain and preserve samples for future analysis.
The fact that purse money has been distributed prior to the issuance of a laboratory report shall not be deemed a finding that no chemical substance has been administered in violation of these Rules to the horse earning such purse money.
12.
Laboratories Approved By The Commission.
Only laboratories approved by the Commission may be used in obtaining analysis reports on urine, or other specimens, taken from the winners or other designated horses of each race meeting.

Split Samples.
As determined by the official veterinarian, when sample quantity permits, each test sample shall be divided into two portions so that one portion shall be used for the initial testing for unknown substances.
If the Trainer or owner so requests in writing to the stewards within 48 hours of notice of positive lab report on the test sample of his horse, the second sample shall be sent for further testing to a drug testing laboratory designated and approved by the commission.
Nothing in this rule shall prevent the commission or executive director from ordering first use of both sample portions for testing purposes.
The results of said split sampling may not prevent the disqualification of the horse as per R65-78-4 and 65-7-8-6.
All costs for transportation and testing of the second sample portion shall be the responsibility of the requesting person.
The official veterinarian shall have overall supervision and responsibility for the freezing, storage and safeguarding of the second sample portion.

Facilitating The Taking Of Urine Samples.
When a horse has been in the test barn more than 1-1/2 hours, a diuretic may be administered by the Official Veterinarian for the purpose of facilitating the collection of a urine sample with permission of the stewards and the trainer or the trainer's authorized test barn representative.
The cost of administration of the diuretic is the responsibility of the trainer.
Prior to the administration of a diuretic, a blood sample may be taken from the horse.
15.
Postmortem Examination.
Every horse which dies or suffers a breakdown on the racetrack in training or in competition within any enclosure licensed by the Commission and is destroyed, may undergo, at a time and place acceptable to the official veterinarian, a postmortem examination to the extent reasonably necessary to determine the injury or sickness which resulted in euthanasia or natural death.

R105-1-3.
Scope.
A.
This rule applies to the procurement and appointment by the Attorney General of outside legal counsel, expert witnesses and providers of litigation support services.
B.
The rule takes into account the special nature of the purposes for which outside counsel, expert witnesses and providers of litigation support services will often be retained, i.e., litigation, enforcement proceedings or investigations.
Legal strategy often requires that a potential plaintiff or defendant not be given any notice of anticipated litigation, or that a party is considering calling expert witnesses; and enforcement proceedings and actions leading to enforcement proceedings are often delicate, with agencies and defendants concerned that in order to prevent undue harm to reputations, the public should not be made aware of any proceedings until preliminary actions have been completed.
To enable the Attorney General to have the flexibility needed to provide outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services in instances where obtaining those services through a publicized solicitation could interfere with legal strategies or could disclose information prematurely, the rule specifically authorizes the Attorney General to determine, pursuant to Utah Code Ann.
Sec. 63-56-24 (1986), that an emergency exists that would pose a threat to the public health, welfare or safety were the Attorney General publicly to disclose, through a request for proposals, information which would otherwise be necessary for a person to submit a proposal or were the Attorney General to delay procuring those services because of the time constraints imposed by the usual procurement procedures for those services.
The rule does provide that even in those "emergency" situations, however, the Attorney General will make the selection with as much competition as practicable under the circumstances.
C.
The rule also provides that the Attorney General will select outside counsel, expert witnesses and providers of litigation support services pursuant to competitive sealed proposals, rather than competitive sealed bids, whenever the Attorney General does not make those selections through the small purchase, sole source, or emergency provisions of this rule.
R105-1-4.
Determination of Small Purchase, Sole Source, Emergency, or Waiver of Request for Proposals.
A.
If the Attorney General determines it is necessary to retain outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation UAC (As of November 1, 2001) Printed: January 4, 2002 Page 33 support services, the Attorney General may first determine whether the retention of outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services can be made under provisions of this rule for: 1.
Small purchases pursuant to section R105-1-7.
2.
Sole source providers pursuant to section R105-1-10.
3.
Emergencies pursuant to section R105-1-9.
4.
Waiver for request for proposals pursuant to section R105-1-10.
B. After the determination under subsection R105-1-4A of this rule has been made, the Attorney General shall proceed to select outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services pursuant to the applicable provisions of this rule.
R105-1-5.
Use of Competitive Sealed Proposals in Lieu of Competitive Sealed Bids.
Projects for which outside counsel, expert witnesses, or providers of litigation support services are obtained are usually unique, and the person submitting the lowest proposed fee might not be the best person to provide the needed service for that particular project.
As a result, it is not practicable or advantageous to the State or its agencies for the Attorney General to obtain the services of outside counsel, expert witnesses, or providers of litigation support services through competitive sealed bids.
Thus, whenever the Attorney General selects outside counsel, expert witnesses, or providers of litigation support services under this rule, the Attorney General will request and receive competitive sealed proposals, rather than competitive sealed bids.
R105-1-6.
Selection of Outside Counsel, Expert Witnesses and Providers of Litigation Support Services Other than through Small Purchase, Sole Source, or Emergency, or Waiver of Request for Proposals Provisions.
A.
If the Attorney General determines the retention of outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services may not be made under sections R105-1-7, R105-1-8, R105-1-9, or Rule R105-1-10 of this rule, the Attorney General shall proceed under this section.
B.
The Attorney General shall prepare a request for proposals ("RFP"), to serve as outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services.
The RFP shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 1.
If the RFP is for outside counsel, the name of the agency, if any, for which outside counsel is sought.
2.
The nature of the project.
3.
The anticipated number of hours that will be required, the beginning date, and the date the project is expected to be completed.
If unknown or irrelevant, the RFP shall so state.
4.
The number of attorneys, law firms, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services that will be retained.
5.
Whether there is a preference or requirement as to how services are to be billed, e.g., payment will be made from a maximum amount against which fees can be billed on an hourly basis, or through a lump sum for the entire project, or through a contingent fee arrangement, or through a set hourly fee.
6.
Whether proposals will be accepted from law firms, associations of attorneys or law firms, or associations of expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services.
7.
The criteria under which the proposals will be evaluated.
The RFP will state the criteria in the order of importance in which the proposals will be evaluated, and the RFP will explicitly state that the criteria are listed in the order in which the proposals will be evaluated.
8.
Examples of criteria include, but are not limited to: a.
Experience of the applicant attorney, law firm, or expert witness or provider of litigation support services on the type of project for which the RFP is issued.
b.
If the RFP is for outside counsel, and the applicant is a law firm, each attorney in the firm that will be assigned to the project, and the experience on the type of project for which the RFP is issued of each attorney in the firm that will be assigned to the project.
c. Whether the applicant attorney, law firm, or expert witness or provider of litigation support services may associate himself or herself with other attorneys, law firms, expert witnesses, providers of litigation support services, or whether the Attorney General will require association.
If the Attorney General requires association, a specification of who the attorney, law firm, expert witness, or provider of litigation support services will be what experience each has in projects of the type for which the RFP was issued, what each will contribute to the project, and the percentage of the project that will be performed by each. d.
Any potential conflicts in providing the services on the project or projects for which the RFP is issued.
e.
The fee to be charged, and how it will be determined, e.g., hourly rate, hourly rate with minimum fee, hourly rate with maximum fee, lump sum payment.
If the attorney, law firm, expert witness, or provider of litigation support services intends to associate with other attorneys, law firms, expert witnesses, or provider of litigation support services, the proposal should state whether the fees and costs quoted include those of the associated attorney, law firm, expert witness or provider of litigation support services, and, regardless of whether the proposal does or does not include their fees and costs, what their fees and costs would be expected to be for the project.
9.
The date by which proposals must be received, and the date on which a decision can be expected to be announced.
10.
The attorney, law firm, expert witness or provider of litigation support services whose proposal is determined to be most advantageous to the State, as determined by the Attorney General, and who accepts appointment by the Attorney General for the project, will be required to enter into a written agreement with the Attorney General's office within a reasonable time after the attorney, law firm, expert witness or provider of litigation support services has been notified that the Attorney General desires to retain their his or her services and the attorney, law firm, expert witness or provider of litigation support services has accepted.
11.
The Attorney General reserves the right to reject latefiled or nonconforming proposals or any and all proposals.

13.

C.
The RFP shall be printed in the "Legal Notices" section of a newspaper of general circulation in the State at least two weeks before the proposals are due.
1.
In the alternative, the Attorney General may, in his or her discretion, have printed in the "Legal Notices" section of a newspaper of general circulation at least three weeks before proposals are due a summary of the RFP, containing sufficient information to convey the nature of the project to a reader, and stating that a copy of the RFP will be sent upon request made to the Attorney General's office, and shall list the Attorney General's office address and phone number.
2.
The times in subsection R105-1-6C of this rule may be shortened if the Attorney General determines in writing that the interests of the State will best be served by shortening the times.
D.
The Attorney General will maintain a record of all attorneys, law firms, expert witnesses and providers of litigation support services who wish to receive copies of RFPs for outside counsel, expert witnesses or providers of litigation support services.
To be placed on the list, the attorney, law firm, expert witness or provider of litigation support services shall submit to the Attorney General's office a written request, stating the name of the attorney, law firm, expert witness or provider of litigation support services and the area or areas in which the attorney or law firm would be qualified to serve as outside counsel, the expert witness would be qualified to serve as an expert witness, and provider of litigation support services would be qualified to provide those services.
The Attorney General shall place the names of the attorney, law firm, expert witness or provider of litigation support services on the appropriate list.

Exclusions and Limitations in Advertisement.
A.
It is a deceptive act or practice for a supplier in connection with a consumer transaction, in the sale or offering for sale of a consumer commodity to make any offer in written or printed advertising or promotional literature without stating clearly and conspicuously in close proximity to the words stating the offer of any material exclusions, reservations, limitations, modifications, or conditions.
The following are examples of the types of material exclusions, reservations, limitations, modifications, or conditions of offers which must be clearly stated: (1) An advertisement for any consumer commodity not disclosing the amount of any additional charge for any of the features displayed or listed in the advertisement would be deceptive.
(2) An advertisement for an article of clothing must state that there is an additional charge for sizes above or below a certain size if such is the case.
(3) An advertisement which offers floor covering with an additional charge for room sizes above or below a certain size must disclose the nature and amount of additional charge.
(4) An advertisement for a consumer commodity sold from more than one outlet under the direct control of the supplier causing the advertisement to be made must state: (a) Which outlets within the area served by the publication in which the advertisement appears either have or do not have certain features mentioned in the advertisement; (b) Which outlets within the area served by the publication in which the advertisement appears charge rates higher than the rate mentioned in advertisement.
For example: U67G@ Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½StÃ¯Â¿Â½TuhrÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ $Ã¯Â¿Â½hÃ¯Â¿Â½qhÃ¯Â¿Â½h Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½XrÃ¯Â¿Â½"qÃ¯Â¿Â½TrrÃ¯Â¿Â½TuÃ¯Â¿Â½PssvprÃ¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½hyyÃ¯Â¿Â½urÃ¯Â¿Â½yphvÃ¯Â¿Â½hrÃ¯Â¿Â½rÃ¯Â¿Â½ (c) An advertisement for a consumer commodity sold from outlets not under the direct control of the supplier causing the advertisement to be made does not violate Section 2a(4)(a) or 2a(4)(b) of this rule if it states that the consumer commodity is available only at participating independent dealers.
(5) An advertisement for any consumer commodity requiring installation must reflect the exact price of the commodity and if the price includes installation or if installation is additional.
(6) If the advertised price is available only during certain hours of the day or certain days of the week that fact must be stated along with the hours and days the price is available.
(7) If the advertisement involves or pictures more than one consumer commodity (for example: a sofa, cocktail table and two commodes) and the advertised price applies only if the complete set is purchased, that fact must be stated.
(8) If there is a minimum amount (or maximum amount) that must be purchased for the advertised price to apply, that fact must be stated.
(9) If an advertisement specifies a price for a consumer commodity which includes a trade-in, that fact must be stated.
For example: a 6 volt battery for $50.00 plus your old battery.
(10) If there are "additional" items that must be purchased for the advertised price to apply that fact must be so stated.
(11) These examples are intended to be illustrative only and do not limit the scope of any section of the Utah Consumer Sales Practices Act or of this or any other rule or regulation.
UAC (As of November 1, 2001) Printed: January 4, 2002 Page 47 B. Offers made orally, such as through radio or television advertising, must include a conspicuously clear and oral statement o f an y material exclu sio n s, reservations, modifications, or conditions.
C.
If an error is made in advertising, either by pricing, wording, picture, or description, it shall be the responsibility of the supplier to retract or correct the error.
A retraction is necessary when it cannot be shown that the error was due to the fault of the advertising medium.
If it can be documented that the responsibility rests with the advertising medium, a retraction by the supplier is not necessary but the supplier may post a correction in close proximity to the merchandise which was advertised incorrectly.
R152-11-3.
Bait Advertising/Unavailability of Goods.
A. Definitions: For the purposes of this rule, the following definitions shall apply: (1) "Raincheck" means a written document evidencing a consumer's entitlement to purchase advertised items at an advertised price within the time limits set forth in paragraph d. of this rule.
(2) "Salesperson" means the supplier or his agent or employee who interacts personally or directly with a consumer in negotiating or effecting a consumer transaction.
B.
It shall be a deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction for a supplier to offer to sell consumer commodities when the offer is not a bona fide effort to sell the advertised consumer commodities.
An offer is not bona fide if: (1) A supplier uses a statement or illustration in any advertisement which would create in the mind of a reasonable consumer a false impression of the grade, quality, quantity, make, value, model, year, size, color, usability, or origin of the consumer co mmodities offered or which otherwise misrepresents the consumer commodities in such a manner that, on subsequent disclosure or discovery of the true facts, the consumer is diverted from the advertised consumer commodities to other consumer commodities.
An offer is not bona fide, even though the true facts are made known to the consumer before he views the advertised consumer commodities, if the first contact or interview is secured by deception.
(2) A supplier discourages the purchase of the advertised consumer commodities in order to sell other consumer commodities.
This does not however, prohibit the good faith recommendation concerning a different consumer commodity as it relates to a consumer's particular or unique needs or problems concerning the consumer commodity.
The following are examples of acts or practices which raise a presumption that an offer to sell consumer commodities is not bona fide: (a) Refusal to show, demonstrate, or sell the consumer commodities advertised in accordance with the terms of the advertisement; (b) Disparagement by the supplier either by acts or words of the advertised consumer commodities or of the guarantee, credit terms, availability of service, repairs, or parts, or any other respects of the consumer commodities; (c) The failure of a supplier to have available at all outlets under its direct control, or listed in the advertisement, a sufficient quantity of the advertised consumer commodities at the advertised price to meet reasonably anticipated demands, unless the advertisement clearly and adequately disclosed that there is a limited quantity of advertised consumer commodities available and/or that the consumer commodities are available only at the designated outlets; (d) The failure to give rainchecks to consumers where the advertisement does not disclose that there is a limited quantity or availability of consumer commodities.
Suppliers who clearly and consistently post a raincheck policy for public review shall be exempt from this section; (e) The showing or demonstrating of defective, unusable, or impractical consumer commodities when such defective, unusable, or impractical nature is not fairly and adequately disclosed in the advertisement; (f) The use of a sales plan or method of compensation for salesperson designed to prevent or discourage them from selling the advertised consumer commodity.
This does not, however, prohibit the usual and reasonable use of commissions as a means of compensation; (g) The demonstration of an advertised consumer commodity in such a manner that makes the commodity appear inferior.
(3) A supplier, in the event of a sale to the consumer of the offered consumer commodities, attempts to persuade a consumer to repudiate the purchase of the offered commodities and purchase other consumer commodities in their stead, by any means, including but not limited to the following: (a) Accepting a consideration for the offered consumer commodities and then switching the consumer to other commodities; (b) Delivering offered consumer commodities which are unusable or impractical for the purposes represented or materially different from the offered consumer commodities.
The purchase on the part of some consumers of the offered consumer commodities is not in itself prima facie evidence that the offer is bona fide. (4) A supplier represents in any advertisement, which would create in the mind of the consumer, a false impression that the offer of goods has been occasioned by a financial or natural catastrophe when such is not true.
(5) A supplier misrepresents the former price, savings, quality or ownership of any goods sold.
R152-11-4.
Use of the Word "Free" etc.
A.
It shall be a deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction for a supplier to use the word "free" or other words of similar import or meaning, except when such representation is, in fact, the case and the cost of the "free" consumer commodity is not passed on to the consumer by raising the regular price of the consumer commodity that must be purchased in connection w
