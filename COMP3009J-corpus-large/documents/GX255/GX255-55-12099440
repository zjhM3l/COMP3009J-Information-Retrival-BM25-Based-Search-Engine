Inside the Star Â· Payload Operations Center authorized 13 hazardous commands, page 3 Â· Review safety tips before operating lawn equipment, page 6 Marshall Space Flight Center May 17, 2001 Center Director announces new Second Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle Program Office at Marshall by Marianne Higgins he Second Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle office at the Marshall Center -- the office that oversees the Space Launch Initiative -- will now report directly to Center Director Art Stephenson.
This program previously reported to the director of the Space Transportation Directorate.
The shift comes with the growth of the Space Launch Initiative (SLI), a oneyear-old NASA initiative designed to develop technologies and lead to creation of a second generation reusable launch vehicle.
"The Space Launch Initiative is NASA's No. 1 development program,"
T
Stephenson said.
"By realigning our office functions, we provide the Second Generation Program Office, and the managers and engineers supporting it, the single program focus needed to meet the goals we have set."
The goals of the Space Launch Initiative are to reduce the cost of launch to low earth orbit to $1,000 per pound of payload and improve safety to loss of crew to 1 in 10,000 flights.
Dennis E. Smith, former deputy director of Marshall's Space Transportation Directorate, will head the Second Generation Program Office.

Marshall only non-mission control facility
555 Marshall Stars
POC authorized to issue hazardous commands by Debra Valine ow that the first experiments onboard the International Space Station are operational, mechanisms must be in place for handling hazardous situations, should any arise.
Johnson Space Center in Houston controls more than 3,000 core hazardous commands, and now the Marshall Center has the authority to issue 13 of those commands that relate to Environmental Control and Life Support Systems.
Marshall is the only facility outside a Mission Control Center authorized for payload/ core hazardous commanding.
A hazardous command is one that relates to a fatal crew injury or illness, and/or the loss of a critical function onboard the Station.
Marshall's Payload Operations Center (POC) -- the science command post for the Space Station -- can authorize 13 vacuum vent core system commands needed to control payload rack environments.
"Hazardous commands would be used to take atmosphere out of an area, for instance, if an experiment needed to be vented, for example, a combustion experiment with noxious fumes that had to be let out," said Mike Savage, an electronics engineer in the Flight Projects Directorate who is Marshall's point of contact for command system software relating to payloads.
At the Payload Operations Center, only the payload rack officer and the command and payload multiplexer/demultiplexer officer are authorized to issue the commands.
Once the need for a command has been determined, there are procedures that must be followed before the command can be executed.
To gain certification, the Marshall Center had to meet stringent procedural and training requirements.
"After all the paperwork was in order, an inspection team came to certify us," Savage said.
Certification was granted following the April 9 inspection.

Standards Continued from page 1 Agency-wide, full-text, technical standards system that will provide NASA engineers and managers with access to full-text standards products -- standards, specifications, recommended practices, handbooks and guidelines -- that are used by NASA.
The Marshall Center served as the pilot program for this initiative, and achieved approximately 75 percent savings over the previous cost of purchasing engineering standards.
"We used to build standards around programs," Gill said.
"There were very few common technical standards products."
The Integrated Technical Standards Initiative is consolidating standards used by multiple Centers and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., into one set everyone can access and use.
"We are working to get away from government standards and come up with a set of NASA-preferred technical standards, based on products of non-government Standards Developing Organizations," Gill said.
"If we cannot find a comparable non-government standard, we will develop our own.
So far, we have developed or converted 70 standards in-house, and have either adopted or plan to adopt more than 1,000 non-NASA technical standards."
Gill's team found some standards being used were outdated, and the programs and Centers were each buying essentially the same engineering standards separately, which was not costeffective.
The Marshall Center alone was spending $400,000 a year on specifications and standards.
With some dedicated research and study, Gill's team found that across NASA, more than $3 million was being spent on technical standards products, including labor costs, because products were being separately purchased, often from the same supplier.
"We were able to negotiate a contract with improved service from another vendor for $100,000 for the pilot study," Gill said.
"This saved the Marshall Center alone about $300,000.
"We then looked at consolidating standards information for NASA-wide use," Gill said.
"Just last week, we signed a five-year contract with USA Information Systems in Virginia Beach, Va., for an average of $1.2 million a year to provide Agency-wide service.
This should save NASA approximately $2 million a year."
This service will enable engineers to access technical standards from one Web site.
Instead of the 45 engineering societies Marshall previously dealt with, there are now 108 societies available to anybody with a "nasa.gov" domain.
Under this program, engineers will have access to the most recently published standards.
If an older document is accessed, the database will point the user to the newest version.
It will tell the user if the change is editorial or technical, and allow program managers to decide whether to make the change or not.
"In the last six months, we have identified 40 lessons learned databases that contain aerospace engineering information that may apply to NASA activities," Gill said.
"We are in the process of linking the appropriate lessons learned back to NASA-adopted standards.
The lessons learned are incorporated so that engineers can use that information to make decisions.
"No one else has a system like ours," Gill said.
"We are collaborating with the National Security Agency and the Environmental protection agency, who are interested in modeling their standardization programs after the NASA program.
The NASA Technical Standard Program is sponsored by the NASA Chief Engineer and managed by Marshall as the Lead Center.

Chandra project scientist doubles as Scrabble expert by Debra Valine olks at the Marshall Center may know him as Dr. Martin Weisskopf, project scientist for the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
But he also has achieved a level of notoriety for his hobby: He's an expert-level tournament Scrabble player.
For Weisskopf, it's more than a board game.
"It's a little different than playing around the kitchen table at home," Weisskopf said.
"We have rankings just like chess players."
He ranks in the top 100-200 tournament players in the United States, making him what he calls a lowlevel expert.
"I like to think that's because I have other things to do," he said.
"We have people who range from those who play for fun to those who study words one or two hours a day," said Weisskopf, who can often be found with flashcards at meetings.
The rankings are similar to tennis seeds.
A person's seed -- or rating -- determines what division he or she will play in the tournament.
Tournaments are round robin or king of the hill, with the winner determined by won-loss record and point spread.
They are played with chess clocks, word judges and official dictionaries, and range from local to regional, national and world in nature.

Martin Weisskopf, right, and his wife, Mary Ellen, met through a Huntsville Scrabble Club.
"My strategy is word power," Weisskopf said.
"I have a reasonably good knowledge of words.
Twenty-thousand words in a language is considered fluent.
I have 80- to 90thousand words."
"Many countries use the same word list we do, and other countries use a different dictionary," Weisskopf said.
"It gets confusing when we play in the world tournament."
The world tournament is played every two years.
The five-day master 's tournament is in Cincinnati in August, and Weisskopf plans to be there.
More than 15,000 players are expected to attend the annual Scrabble championships later this year in Thailand.
"I started playing Scrabble at home as a child," Weisskopf said, "but I didn't get into tournaments until 1982 in Huntsville.
There was a tournament at the HuntsvilleMadison County Public Library.
I thought I was pretty good at the time, but I got my butt kicked."
In 1984, after playing in a couple more humbling tournaments, Weisskopf joined a Scrabble club.
"I met my wife Mary Ellen through the Scrabble club.
She beat me the first couple hundred times we played."
Mary Ellen teaches computer science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and also plays tournamentlevel Scrabble.
Weisskopf, who has won tournaments in Reno, Nev.; Jackson, Miss.; and Jonesboro, Ark., employs an open strategy when playing Scrabble.
Creating words in a parallel formation is considered a closed game.
An open game is more perpendicular with longer words and more opportunities to form other words.
"My strategy is word power," Weisskopf said.
"I have a reasonably good knowledge of words.
Twentythousand words in a language is considered fluent.
I have 80- to 90-thousand words."
Anyone looking for a tournament can usually find one, he said.
The National Scrabble Association has a Web site that lists locations.
Over Memorial Day weekend, there is a tournament in Elizabethtown, Ky.
The Weisskopfs will probably be there.

Review safety tips before operating lawn equipment from the Marshall Safety Office pring is here and for many of us that means yard work.
Through the years we have progressed from the manual push type -- to gas powered push mowers -- to riding mowers.
Also, hedge trimmer, weed trimmers and lawn edgers have become important tools for helping us keep a beautiful lawn.
No matter what type of tools or equipment you're using today, you need to take a few minutes to review safety practices.
Yes, they are just common sense, but people continue to injure themselves every year.
Did you know that hospital emergency rooms nationwide treat about 87,000 lawn mower injuries a year? More than 20,000 are under age 25, including 10,000 younger than 15.
Injuries include deep cuts, loss of fingers and toes, broken and dislocated bones, burns, eye injuries, and injuries from objects flying out from under the mower.
S
wear cloth shoes or sandals.
Â· Use protective eyewear and hearing protection.
Â· Don't allow children younger than 14 to use ride-on mowers.
Do not allow children younger than 12 to use walkbehind mowers.
Â· Clear the lawn of sticks, stones, toys and anything else that might be flung by the mower, trimmer or edger.
Â· While the lawn is being mowed, keep others away to ensure their safety.
A mower blade can pick up and throw objects with force sufficient to seriously injure or kill.
Â· Keep hands and feet away from the mower housing, and never unclog the mower when it's running.
Â· Don't mow, trim or edge "blind spots."
There may be hidden obstacles under bushes or hedges, or in trees.
Â· Be aware of the lawn's surface; watch out for "pot holes" or tree roots.
Â· Never leave equipment running, or tools laying where others might stumble over them.
In general Â· Before mowing, trimming or edging, read the owner's manual and pay particular attention to safety recommendations.
Â· Be sure all protective devices, such as guards or shields, are in place before operating.
Â· Start and refuel a mower outdoors, not in a garage or shed.
Mowers should be refueled with the motor turned off and cool.
Â· Store gasoline outside the house and away from any heat source.
Â· Wear sturdy shoes with rough soles.
Never go barefoot or
For gasoline mowers Â· Fill the tank before starting and don't refill it after the engine is hot.
Â· Never dangle gas cans from mower handles where a hot exhaust pipe could ignite escaping fumes and cause an explosion.
Â· Start the mower on level ground where you have firm footing.
Mow parallel to a slope.
Never pull the mower toward you -- always push it.
Â· Always turn off the mower and disconnect the spark plug wire before unclogging the machine or adjusting it.
Gasoline mowers can start even when they're turned off if the blade is rotated.
Wear sunscreen -- and use common sense
W
hether you are mowing your lawn, or just enjoying the day with family, don't forget the sunscreen.
A recent survey by the American Academy of Dermatology shows that some parents who applied sunblock to their children allowed those children to be out in the sun longer than they normally would have.
Health experts equate that behavior with a driver going faster just because a car has anti-lock brakes.
Remember that sunblock doesn't completely protect skin from the damaging effects of the sun, researchers say.
So take other precautions to prevent skin damage, such as limiting your time in the sun to no more than two to three hours during the peak hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Also, reapply sunblock on a regular basis when you're out in the sun.
-- Adapted from The New York Times
For riding mowers Â· Drive up and down slopes when operating riding mowers.
For electric mowers Â· Check cords and plugs.
Use a ground-fault interrupter to ensure your safety.
Â· If your electric mower isn't labeled "doubled insulated," never plug it into anything but a grounded (3-prong) outlet.
Hedge trimmers/weed trimmers/lawn edgers Â· Wear safety eye protection.
It's also a good idea to wear long pants when doing lawn work to protect from abrasions.
Â· Never use electric-hedge trimmers over your head.
If the trimmer becomes lodged on something, disconnect power source before attempting to dislodge it.
Â· Remember weed trimmers are intended for groundwork only, not for overhead work in trees or bushes.
Â· When using a weed trimmer, disconnect power before advancing the line if it is a manual-feed trimmer.
