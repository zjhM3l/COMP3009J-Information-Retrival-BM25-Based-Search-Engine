INTRODUCTION These clinical practice guidelines on the assessment and treatment of diabetes mellitus are intended to facilitate the management of persons with diabetes seen in specialty as well as primary care settings.
The guidelines are broad enough to encompass the critical decision points in patient management, such as glycemic control, evaluation of the eyes and feet, and early recognition and treatment of co-morbid conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal disease.
At the same time, they are designed to be flexible so that local policies or procedures, such as those regarding referrals to or consultation with diabetes teams, ophthalmology, optometry, podiatry, nephrology, and endocrinology (lipids), can be accommodated.
Medication usage guidelines have been adapted from the Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Health Group Medical Advisory Panel Guidelines for Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM), Hypertension and Cholesterol.
DEFINITIONS The Veterans Health Administration defines Clinical Practice Guidelines as1: Recommendations for the performance or exclusion of specific procedures or services derived through a rigorous methodological approach that includes the following: Â·
Determination of appropriate criteria, such as effectiveness, efficacy, population benefit, or patient satisfaction, and Literature review to determine the strength of the evidence (based in part on study design) in relation to these criteria.
Â·
Clinical a set of diagram diabetes
practice guidelines are frequently displayed in the form of an algorithm (an algorithm is rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps).
Typically, a clinical algorithm s a guideline into a step-by-step decision tree.
VHA's clinical practice guideline for mellitus is displayed in algorithmic format.
Clinical practice guidelines, which are being used increasingly in health care, are seen by many as a potential solution to inefficiency and inappropriate variation in care.
Guidelines should be evidence-based and based upon explicit criteria, to ensure consensus regarding their internal validity.2, 3 However, it is acknowledged that the use of guidelines must always be in the context of a provider's clinical judgment in the care of a particular person.
For that reason, the guidelines may be viewed as an educational tool analogous to textbooks and journals, but in an userfriendlier format.
Clinical Pathways are defined as: Â·
Clinical management tools that organize, sequence, and specify the timing for the major patient care activities and interventions of the entire interdisciplinary team for a particular diagnosis or procedure.
Clinical Pathways define key processes and events in the day-to-day management of care and often serve as a component of the patient record.
Variance from the pathway along with causes of variance should be documented.

OVERVIEW OF THE DIABETES GUIDELINES: The diabetes mellitus guidelines are organized into six major modules, with a linkage diabetes algorithm providing an overview of the relationship between the modules: Â·

Diabetes prevention strategies can be conceptually divided into three categories: Primary Prevention, Secondary Prevention, and Tertiary Prevention.
Primary prevention refers to the prevention of the onset of diabetes.
Although National Institutes of Health sponsored controlled, randomized, clinical trials of primary prevention of Type I and Type II diabetes in high-risk individuals are underway, it will be years before the results are available.
Secondary prevention in diabetes is the concept that improved glycemic control will result in a decrease in the development of microvascular complications.
Finally, tertiary prevention is the premise that screening for the presence of early microvascular disease (such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) will lead to the identification of individuals for whom therapeutic interventions can reduce their subsequent risk of blindness, renal failure and amputation.
Each module uses a risk stratification approach to identify persons with diabetes who have a greater probability of developing complications, and who therefore would benefit from more intensive intervention.
Finally, providers should recognize that the major cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with diabetes is cardiovascular disease -- myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.
It accounts for over 70% of hospitalizations and deaths.
Therefore an aggressive approach to evaluating and reducing cardiovascular risk factors -- including smoking cessation, management of hyperlipidemia, treatment of hypertension, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle -- should be a general goal for all providers.
While each module is designed for use by primary care providers in an the modules can also be used to coordinate and standardize care within as teaching tools for students and housestaff.
However, it should be reco algorithms, as is true for most, cannot be used as a linear guideline management of diabetes mellitus and are not intended to supersede the provider caring for an individual.

The majority of the literature support for these guidelines, referenced throughout the document, is based upon key clinical randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies published from 1992 through March, 1997 in the areas of diabetes, hypertension, lipid management, renal disease and foot and eye care.
Each of the references listed have undergone a thorough review and rating based on the scientific rigor of the article, clinical relevance of the material presented and the ability to generalize using this data.
Where existing literature is ambiguous or conflicting, or where scientific data are lacking on an issue, recommendations are based on the expert panels' opinion and clinical experience.
Annotations indicate whether each recommendation is based on scientific data or expert opinion.
A letter, (e.g., "A or B") within a box of the algorithm refers the reader to an annotation for that box.
The annotation typically follows the specific page of the algorithm in the sections labeled "Algorithms and Annotations" in each module.
Strength of recommendations grading as well as level of evidence grading is based on AHCPR guideline development efforts4.
For a description of each, refer to the following tables: Strength of Recommendation Level I Level IIa Level IIb Level III a

GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT Diabetes in the Veterans Health Administration Diabetes is now recognized to account for over 14% of health care expenditures in the United States, although only 3.1% of Americans have diagnosed diabetes.4 The burden of diabetes in the VHA, documented in a recent series of VHA reports (6, 7, 8) is among the highest of any national health care system: Â·
The prevalence of diabetes among all veterans receiving outpatient care is estimated to be about 15%, and 20% among veterans receiving care in general medicine, primary care, or women's health clinics.
The average demographic profile is that of a 64-year-old male with an income less than $7000.
12.0% of veterans were identified as having prescribed diabetes specific medications (insulin, oral agents, or monitoring supplies) as an outpatient in FY94.
This group of veterans accounted for 24% of all pharmacy costs; nearly 7 cents out of every outpatient pharmacy dollar was spent on glycemic control medications and supplies.
Given scientific advances since that time, the availability of new, and more expensive, antiglycemic agents; and a 40% increase in self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) expenditures, these data are considered to underestimate current expenditures.
28% of all veterans on dialysis in FY94 who received erythropoietin had an associated diagnosis of diabetes.
0.9% of veterans with diabetes sequentially examined in an Optometry Service multisite field study had severe visual loss 52% of all lower extremity amputations occurred in veterans with diabetes and revisions in the VHA in FY94
Â·
Â·
Â·
Â·
Â·
Â·
5.6% of admissions of veterans with diabetes were associated with the metabolic complications of the disease, and 3.5% were for pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Although veterans with diabetes have a disproportionate number of hospitalizations relative to veterans without diabetes, diagnosis, education, preventive screening, risk factor reduction, and pharmaceutical treatment of diabetes, including microvascular and macrovascular complications, occurs mostly in the outpatient primary care setting.
10
However, despite the costs and morbidity associated with diabetes, and the general consensus that preventive care can delay, if not prevent, a significant percentage of the instances of visual loss, chronic renal failure, foot ulcers and lower extremity amputations, as well as admissions for metabolic control, 1996 baseline performance data from the VHA External Peer Review Program (8) indicates the following rates of preventive screening or intervention: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·
50.8% of veterans had at least an annual glycosylated hemoglobin test 46.5 % of veterans had an annual eye exam for the detection of retinopathy 71.8 % of veterans had an annual visual inspection of the foot 44.9% of veterans had an annual examination of pedal pulses 33.5% of veterans had an annual sensory examination of the foot 27.5% of veterans received an influenza vaccine 24.9% of veterans received a pneumococcal vaccine
Diabetes should be considered a serious public health problem both in the United States and in the Veterans Health Administration; and its detection and treatment must be viewed as the responsibility of all health care providers.
Furthermore, although the primary care provider is responsible for overall coordination of care, each health care provider is urged to assume responsibility for preventive care for the entire person at time of each encounter.
For example, a podiatrist should be alert as to whether an eye exam has been performed within the past year; and an ophthalmologist should be concerned whether there is evidence of clinical nephropathy in a person with retinopathy.
Each should be aware of the symptoms of uncontrolled hyperglycemia and be able to make appropriate referrals back to the primary care provider or subspecialist team.
Expanded roles for nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants, dietitians and pharmacists should be considered.
These guidelines should be used as an impetus for administrators at each Veterans Integrated Services Network (VISN), facility, and care access site to develop innovative plans to break down the barriers preventing primary care providers, subspecialists and allied health professionals from working together, and from preventing patients from having prompt access to preventive care.
Guideline Development Process The goal in developing the guideline for diabetes mellitus was not to repeat the guideline development process, but rather, to incorporate the information from several existing, national consensus, evidence-based guidelines into a format which would maximally facilitate clinical decision-making.
The use of the algorithm format was chosen because of the evidence that such a format improves data collection, diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making and changes patterns of resource use.
However, few guidelines are published in such a format.
Furthermore, multiple guidelines covering the same topic, can be confusing and even conflicting.
To enhance continuity of care, the VHA Diabetes Guidelines were designed to encompass a broad spectrum of outpatient care of patients with diabetes.
This required incorporating multiple published guidelines into a single, unified document.
This guideline and the algorithms were the product among over 70 experts from all aspects of the developers/contributors include Veterans Health representatives from key federal health related agenci of seven months of consensus building health care continuum.
The list of Administration professionals, senior es including the Diabetes Division of the 11
National Institutes for Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Division of Diabetes Translation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Office of Managed Care, Health Care Financing Administration; and the Pharmacoeconomic Center of the Department of Defense, as well as private sector experts provided by the VHA External Peer Review Program contractor.
In addition, other participants hold or have recently held senior leadership positions in the American Diabetes Association, and the National Institutes of Health/Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Education Program.
The list of contributors includes nurses, dietitians, social workers and physicians representing Podiatry, Endocrinology, Ophthalmology, Optometry, Geriatrics, Internal Medicine, and Primary Care and expert consultants in the field of guideline and algorithm development.
Additionally, the guideline and algorithm draws heavily from existing American Diabetes Association, National Cholesterol Education Program, and National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for diabetes mellitus.
Recommendations for pharmacologic management of persons with diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia developed by VHA's Medical Advisory Panel (MAP) to the Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Health Group are also integrated.
Consumer input is also being solicited and will be included in future revision of the guidelines.
The results of these discussions, as well as insights from four focus groups with family members, will be instrumental in guiding future development of the algorithms.
The perspective of the customers (veterans and their family members) is valued as a tool to help sensitize the algorithm developers and users to the needs of the patients.
In summary, it is acknowledged that the science and conclusions of other guidelines, especially those of the American Diabetes Association, have largely been incorporated into VHA guidelines.
A summary of the VHA Diabetes Clinical Guidelines in relation to other existing national guidelines is provided in an attached table.
However, the VHA Diabetes Guidelines represent the first comprehensive guidelines for this disease by a federal agency or national health care system in which risk stratification is both explicit and evidence based.
The VHA clinical guidelines are appropriate as a foundation, along with the use of the Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Health Group/Medical Advisory Panel Guidelines and Headquarters External Peer Review Program Performance Measures, for a Diabetes Chronic Disease State Management Program.
Disease State Management can be defined as the continuous process of identifying and delivering, within selected patient populations, the most efficient combination of resources for the treatment of or prevention of disease.
The rationale assumes that there are systematic ways health care delivery can be provided to a population that will be more efficient than the status quo.
However, while the guidelines are appropriate for population based medicine, it is not their intent to prevent practitioners from using their best judgment in the care of an individual patient, but rather to establish verifiable treatment objectives for veterans with diabetes that will lead to a reduction in limb loss, visual loss, chronic renal insufficiency, and cardiovascular disease.

Biochemical Criteria for the Diagnosis of Diabetes The criteria are derived from the Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus published June 1997.
Oral glucose tolerance testing is not currently recommended for diagnosis in the general medical population.
Variations in the accuracy and precision of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing and capillary glucose monitoring measures (see Module G, Annotation F) preclude their use for diagnostic purposes.

*The FPG is the preferred test for diagnosis, but any one of the three listed is acceptable.
In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation, one of these three tests should be used on a different day to confirm diagnosis.
**Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours.
***Casual = any time of day without regard to time since last meal; symptoms are the classic ones of polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.
****OGTT should be performed using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.
The OGTT is not recommended for routine clinical use.

Clinical Classification of Type I or Type II Patients with Type I diabetes are insulin requiring, and therefore will develop ketoacidosis if not treated with insulin, or if insulin requirements increase during stress.
On the other hand, persons with Type II diabetes may need to be treated with insulin to improve glycemic control, but will usually not develop ketoacidosis if they do not receive insulin.
Persons with diabetes treated with medical nutritional therapy (MNT), physical activity, and/or oral hypoglycemic or antiglycemic agents are classified as having Type II diabetes.
In practice, the proper diagnosis is important for several reasons.
First, persons with Type II diabetes treated with insulin may be able to achieve comparable levels of glycemic control with hypoglycemic or antiglycemic agents, especially if they were placed on insulin because of an intercurrent illness, injury, or surgery and not subsequently reevaluated.
Secondly, persons with Type I diabetes are generally more prone to develop hypoglycemia or ketosis, especially during times of stress.
For coding purposes, patients with Type I diabetes are coded as 250.01 or 250.03 (uncontrolled), while patients with Type II diabetes are coded as 250.00.
or 250.02 (uncontrolled).
Often the classification of diabetes was made at the time of diagnosis and never reevaluated.
However, since persons with Type II diabetes can also present with a degree of ketosis, providers should be encouraged to review the classification of the diabetes in their patients.
In a primary care setting, determination of the patient's age at the diagnosis of diabetes, the body mass index, and urine ketones, is usually sufficient to classify the patient.
CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION Classification Age BMI Urine ketones Likely Type I 
B.
General Medical Evaluation In the veteran population, diabetes may not be a patient's only disease, nor is it necessarily the disorder which needs to be prioritized for immediate treatment.
It should also be noted that overt hyperglycemia is commonly precipitated by physical and psychological stress, and that secondary forms of diabetes, while rare, should be excluded.
Is Patient Medically and Psychologically Stable? Urgent or semi-urgent medical conditions must be treated before chronic disease management principles are applied.
"Stable" is the judgment of the individual provider.
It should be noted that patients with diabetes who have more immediate medical or psychiatric problems should still have an educational needs assessment done to determine whether they have sufficient skills to 23
C.
manage their glycemic control during a period of intercurrent illness, with a goal of avoiding symptomatic hypo- or hyperglycemia.
D. Provide Treatment and Stabilization Any numerical metabolic criteria for admission for persons with significant hypo- or hyperglycemia are arbitrary.
INTERQUAL criteria are widely used in the Veterans Health Administration.
However, it should be noted that the criteria are not risk stratified for co-morbid conditions, socioeconomic circumstances, or psychological status.
Furthermore, factors such as proximity to the provider or the availability of telephone monitoring are not included in the criteria.
Therefore, the decision for hospitalization versus outpatient treatment must be consistent with the provider's best judgment.

Factor Validation of HbA1c testing
Reference DCCT Research Group 1993 Ohkubo et al. (1994) DCCT Research Group 1995; 1996
The assessment of glycemic control in an individual requires an understanding of the methods used to assess long term blood sugar control (glycosylated hemoglobins); short term glycemic control (fructosamine); and single point measurement of blood sugar (venous samples and capillary glucose measurements).
The key points to remember are that you must determine the method and accuracy of the glycosylated hemoglobin test performed in the laboratory at your facility, how the results are reported, and what the high normal cutoff value is.
You should be able to obtain this information from the Chief of Laboratory Service or a diabetologist.
Since there is inherent error in the test, you should realize that the reported value has a range of error associated with it.
Ideally, your laboratory should participate in a standardization program for glycosylated hemoglobin testing that results in accuracy within 5% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), The National Institutes of Health, and the American Association of Clinical Chemists.
In addition, either a HbA1c test should be performed or the results of the glycosylated hemoglobin assay should be reported as HbA1c equivalents.
Finally, while venous blood sugars are accurate and standardized throughout the VHA, "capillary measurements" can vary widely.
Detailed explanations follow.
GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN 1.
The terms "glycated" and "glycosylated" hemoglobin are used interchangeably in the literature.
The terms are used to describe the reaction product between sugar and a protein.
Glycosylated hemoglobins (GHb) are most useful for monitoring diabetic patients.
There are four HbA1 components: HbA1a1, HbA1a2, HbA1b, HbA1c.
2.
3.
27
4.
The Scientific Research Group of the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and the ADA recommend HbA1c as the marker of choice for the assessment of risk for the development of microvascular complications, as well as for monitoring glycemic control.
Risk assessment of secondary complications stratified to level of glycemic control will be based on the HbA1c database of the DCCT, which was standardized for accuracy by a "gold standard" or peer consensus reference method.
Facilities that measure total GHb should be able to provide accurate HbA1c equivalency values.
However, there is no analytic system that measures HbA1 and can report HbA1c equivalency values.
Some methods are more susceptible to hemoglobinopathy (i.e., Hb S, C, D, G, F, and labile intermediate products) interference that can cause biases in the test results.
In order to obtain accurate HbA1c values it is important to assay specimens with known hemoglobinopathies on analytic systems that are insensitive to hemoglobin variants as interfering substances.
Presently, only one analyzer (HPLC method using borate-affinity column chromatography) can be used reliably for this purpose.
If a patient has a hemoglobinopathy, consult with the Laboratory Chief to determine whether or not the glycosylated hemoglobin test performed at your institution is valid for that particular patient.
HbA1c measurements may also be unreliable in the presence of the following conditions: hemolytic anemia, uremia, or pregnancy.
Serum fructosamine measurement may be considered as an alternative test in these circumstances.
5.
6.
7.
8.
SERUM FRUCTOSAMINE MEASUREMENT 1.
Fructosamine is a glycosylated protein that may be a potential marker for assessment for glycemic control for the 10-20 days prior to measurement.
Newer assays appear to be highly specific for fructosamine and free from interference by urates and triglycerides.
The assay has a limitation, i.e., that gross changes in protein concentration and half-life may have large effects on the proportion of protein that is glycosylated.
Thus, results obtained may be invalid in the presence of cirrhosis of the liver, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, or rapid changes in acute-phase reactants.
2.
GLUCOSE MEASUREMENTS Practical uses of glucose measurements: 1.
Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) or point of care glucose measurements should not be substituted for the laboratory glucose measurement for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
28
2.
HbA1c or its equivalent is the only validated indicator for assessment of risk for microvascular complications.
The most common user error associated with SMBG i Depending upon the meter used, this error can lead to between the actual and recorded blood glucose. maintenance procedures should be reviewed annually or s inadequate sample size.
a significant discrepancy A user's technique and as indicated.
3.
4.
The accuracy and precision of the glucose meter should be determined (see Blood Glucose Monitoring Devices Resource Guide, from the VA National Center for Laboratory Accuracy and Standardization, published February 1997).
Assuming that the mean SMBG or point of care or laboratory glucose measurements are accurate, multiple readings at various time points can be averaged to obtain approximate HbA1c levels by using the equation from the DCCT database:

Determine Recommended Glycemic Target Using Risk Stratification Criteria The upper limit of normal HbA1c is approximately 6% in the absence of diabetes.
For persons with diabetes mellitus, it is recommended that the current American Diabetes Association recommendation that the ideal HbA1c goal is 7%, with therapeutic action suggested at values 
Using this approach, target levels would range between 7% and 9%.
7.0% ( 1% above high normal range): Life expectancy of 15 years or more in the absence of diabetic complications, or 10 years or more in the presence of early to moderate microvascular disease.
8.0% ( 2% above high normal range): Life expectancy of 5-15 years in the absence of microvascular disease, or 5-10 years in the presence of microvascular disease.
9.0% ( 3% above high normal range): Life expectancy of less than 5 years, with or without microvascular disease.

RISK STRATIFICATION OF GLYCEMIC TARGET RANGES 1.
Estimate the life expectancy of the person you are treating.
Statistics for the life expectancy of a population can be derived from the observed mortality rates of that population.
An example commonly used in medicine would be the life expectancy of persons with a particular type and stage of cancer.
The population would have an average survival, with a wider range of survival into which almost all individuals would fall.
While it would be impossible to tell an individual person exactly how long he or she would live, it would be possible to provide that person with some estimate of his or her life expectancy.
Based upon life expectancy and mortality rates due to the disease, the provider and patient would discuss treatment options.
Prostate cancer would be a specific example of how this concept could be used.
Longitudinal studies of the life expectancy of persons with diabetes have been done and indicate that persons with diabetes have a shortened life span relative to persons without diabetes.
However, the format of the data from such studies is not easily utilized.
To provide the clinician with a means of estimating life expectancy for populations of men and women with Type II diabetes, tables (See Exhibits G1 and G2) have been generated based upon a computer model (courtesy Richard Eastman, MD, NIDDK; Eastman et al.
Diabetes Care, 1997), that incorporates data from the Framingham Study.
Except for end stage renal disease, the model assumes that microvascular complications do not affect survival, although they do predict progression to blindness, amputation, and dialysis.
Co-existing conditions (such as CHF, AIDS, COPD, cirrhosis, cancer, etc.) have a significant effect on survival, but are not explicitly noted in the tables.
However, for any given age at the time of diagnosis of diabetes, the years of life remaining after diagnosis are provided in the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles.
It can be assumed that populations of persons with diabetes and other health conditions would have a survival rate less than the mean life expectancy (use 25th percentile), and that persons without co-morbid conditions and with a favorable family history would have a survival rate greater than the mean life expectancy (use 75th or 95th percentile).
32
Furthermore, aggressive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors (see Lipid and Hypertension modules), including smoking cessation, may increase life expectancy.
In addition, adherence to general preventive practices (for example immunizations, screening for colon, prostate, and breast cancers) is also predicted to increase life expectancy in the American population.
Thus, for an individual with diabetes, an estimate of life expectancy for a given percentile can be obtained by determining the person's age at the time of diagnosis of diabetes and determining the average (mean) years of life remaining by subtracting the time (in years) that has elapsed from the time of diagnosis.
Providers must then use their best judgment to raise or lower it based upon coexisting medical conditions and family history.
While a person's age is clearly the predominant factor in estimating life expectancy, this approach ensures that the life expectancy estimate used in determining target glycemic ranges for an individual is also based upon the person's individual health state and the best judgment of the clinician.
2.
Determine the presence or absence of early to moderate retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy (see Renal and Eye Modules).
The presence of microvascular complications (e.g., retinopathy, microalbuminuria, neuropathy) increases the probability that end stage microvascular complications (e.g., visual loss, renal failure, and amputation) will occur as compared to the probability for an individual without microvascular complications but with a similar life expectancy.
3.
Consider genetic factors.
The risk stratification approach can be extended by the practitioner to include family history of microvascular complications.
Results from the DCCT and other studies indicate that a familial history of diabetic nephropathy or retinopathy does predispose a sibling or a child towards developing microvascular complications.
However, the evidence does not support different treatment goals for individuals of varying ethnicity's.
While the prevalence of diabetes and its complications is higher in ethnic populations, the increase in microvascular complications cannot be attributed to an increased sensitivity to the effects of hyperglycemia.
4.
Determine an initial target value of glycosylated hemoglobin based upon consideration of the patient's life expectancy, presence of microvascular complications, and genetic factors.
Based upon the DCCT results, using an HbA1c value obtained by HPLC with an intra-assay variation of 0.1% and a high normal value of 6.05%, the following target levels are recommended as starting points for negotiation with the patient.
33
7.0% (1% above high normal range): Life expectancy of 15 years or more in the absence of diabetic complications or 10 years or more in the presence of early to moderate microvascular disease.
8.0% (2% above high normal range): Life expectancy between 5 and 15 years in the absence of microvascular disease, or between 5 and 10 years in the presence of microvascular disease.
9.0% (3% above high normal range): Life expectancy of less than 5 years, with or without microvascular disease.
NOTE: Risk stratification should be based upon glycosylated hemoglobin results performed or reported as HbA1c values.
Depending upon the glycosylated hemoglobin assay used at your facility, the absolute value of the target range may differ from the DCCT recommendations, although the percent (%) above high normal value will not.
5.
Negotiate the target range with the patient, taking into account risks and benefits of the proposed therapeutic intervention (see Annotation H).
Providers must recognize that a target range of glycosylated hemoglobin, based upon life expectancy, microvascular complications, and familial history, is a starting point for negotiation with the patient.
It does not mean that a lower HbA1c level will not be beneficial, nor does it mean that the provider and patient should not negotiate a lower one.
Rather, it implies that there is a decreasing benefit from achieving improved glycemic control, which should be taken into account when evaluating the risks and benefits of pharmacologic therapy as well as patient preferences.
Also, it should be recognized that reduction in risk from decreasing HbA1c is a continuum, so a negotiated "target level" does not have to be exactly 7.0, 8.0, or 9.0.
A detailed explanation of the terms absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction follows.
RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE RISK REDUCTION Based on the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) and DCCT findings, the major determinants of the effectiveness of glycemic control in preventing the development or progression of clinically significant (e.g., visual loss, renal insufficiency, and amputation) complications are: (1) the patient's life expectancy and, (2) the presence of earlier microvascular disease, especially retinopathy, persistent microalbuminuria or macroproteinuria (See Eye Module) when other conditions have been excluded (see Renal Module) and peripheral neuropathy (see Routine Care Foot Module).
The Ohkubo Study was a controlled randomized trial that demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy in Japanese individuals with Type II diabetes who were 34
not overweight had similar results to the DCCT with respect to reduction in the onset and progression of retinopathy and microalbuminuria.
Analysis of the risk reduction in microvascular complications from the DCCT supports the conclusion that the relative risk reduction of intermediate microvascular complications of diabetes (i.e., development of background retinopathy and microalbuminuria) can be reduced by about 40% for each 1% decrease in HbA1c in persons with Type I diabetes.
Although controlled, randomized trials of glycemic control in Type II individuals who are overweight or from other ethnic groups are not available, longitudinal population studies (WESDR) demonstrate that the exponential rise in the risk of retinopathy in persons with Type II diabetes follows a similar gradient as for persons with Type I diabetes.
Consequently, the evidence is consistent with the conclusion that the development of microvascular disease is similarly related to glycemic control in persons with either Type I or Type II diabetes.
However, it should be noted that the conclusions of the DCCT and Ohkubo studies were based on intermediate microvascular complications.
Progression to proliferative retinopathy was uncommon, and no patients progressed to renal insufficiency.
Therefore, it should be recognized that maximal benefits of glycemic control in preventing the progression of microvascular disease to the endpoints of visual loss or chronic renal insufficiency accrue over a period of time longer than that of the study period of the aforementioned trials.
Thus, the probability that an individual with diabetes will develop these complications is based upon his or her life expectancy.
However, the mean age at onset of Type II diabetes (
Consequently, life expectancy from the time of diagnosis is lower in persons with Type II diabetes as a result of death from cardiovascular conditions as well as all other causes (co-morbidity).
There are no interventional trials that conclusively demonstrate that improved glycemic control will alter cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality.
The DCCT and the Ohkubo trials show a nonsignificant trend towards reduced cardiovascular events with intensive insulin therapy, while the VA Cooperative trial demonstrates a nonsignificant increase in cardiovascular events and an association between decreased HbA1c and new cardiovascular events.
Observational studies demonstrate an association between increased HbA1c and cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality risk that achieves statistical significance only for women.
For populations of persons with diabetes, it is possible to estimate the decrease in microvascular complications that would result from improved glycemic control.
Absolute risk reduction is defined as the decrease in visual loss (blindness), end stage renal disease, or amputation that occurs with a given decrease in percent HbA1c.
Since the previously noted clinical studies are limited in duration, computer models of Type I and Type II diabetes have been developed that can 35
provide estimates of the incidence of microvascular complications and life expectancy.
These models provide population estimates of risk, and can be useful in providing both providers and persons with diabetes with an estimate of risk over time as well as an estimate of benefit from improved glycemic control.
In conclusion, the absolute risk reduction in endstage microvascular disease over an individual's lifetime is the major determinant of the target range of glycemic control for an individual, and will influence the risk/benefit analysis of therapeutic options.
H. Discuss and Set An Appropriate Target with the Patient, Considering Medical and Psychosocial Issues It is evident that the risks of therapy are different for each individual, dependent upon his or her medical, social, and psychological status.
Thus, the risks of a proposed therapy must be balanced against the potential benefits.
Factors for the provider and person with diabetes to consider in jointly making this decision should include the following: Â· Â· Â·
Appropriate medical support and psychosocial environment History of severe, recurrent hypoglycemia The possible consequence of adverse effects associated with hypoglycemia (consider cardiovasular disease, anticoagulation, use of dangerous equipment, etc.)
Alcohol or substance abuse The presence of multiple end-stage microvascular complications, including macular edema, proliferative retinopathy and macroproteinuria, especially with elevated serum creatinine.
Pregnancy, or the intention to become pregnant Symptomatic cardiovascular disease Willingness and ability to self-monitor and to make appropriate lifestyle change Quality of life Specific risks of individual therapeutic options
Â· Â·
Â· Â· Â·
Â· Â·
I.
Is Glycemic Control, by Lab Value, Above the Target Range? Since there is no evidence to suggest that the frequency of obtaining glycosylated hemoglobin levels is correlated with improvement in that level in Type II diabetes, practitioners must use their own judgment in deciding upon frequency in an individual patient.
Factors to be considered include whether glycemic control is stable; whether the target goal has been achieved; and whether therapy has been changed.
An assessment of long term, short 36
term, and current glycemic control can be made by integrating information obtained from glycosylated hemoglobin levels, fructosamine values, and serum/capillary glucose measurements (see annotation F).
J. Does the Patient Have Side Effects from Treatment? Side effects can include hypoglycemia and specific complications from oral agents.
Patients with hypoglycemia should be evaluated for precipitating factors that may be easily correctable (missed meals, incorrect administration of insulin [dosage or timing], exercise, etc).
In many cases a simple adjustment can be made in nutrition, exercise, medication and/or patient self monitoring (see Nutrition, Physical Activity, Medication, and Home Monitoring subalgorithms).
In persons with near normal glycemic control (most specifically persons with Type I diabetes on intensive insulin treatment; or in persons with autonomic neuropathy), it may be necessary to relax the degree of glycemic control, at least temporarily.
Complex adjustments may best be accomplished through co-management with a Diabetes Team.
Do the Benefits of Achieving Target Glycemic Range Justify the Risk of Side Effects? With the exception of pregnancy, where glycemic control affects the health of the baby and the mother, the benefits and risks of therapy are related to reduction in absolute risk of end stage complications for the individual.
In that context, the occurrence of severe hypoglycemic reactions in a young person with Type I diabetes on an intensive insulin regimen has a different context than in an older individual with known coronary artery disease.
Decisions on risk/benefit are always individual.
It must also be recognized that steps can be taken to reduce the incidence of side effects of therapy (especially hypoglycemia; see Annotation J).
Are High Risk Characteristics Present? Patient is pregnant or is planning pregnancy; is on an intensive insulin regimen; has recurrent or severe hypoglycemia, has hypoglycemic unawareness; or has had recent hospitalizations for DKA or severe hyperglycemia.

B.
Institute/Adjust Insulin TreatmentTypes, frequency and dosages of insulin must be individualized.
Factors to be considered are: Type I or Type II diabetes; age; weight; comorbid conditions; presence of autonomic neuropathy; concomitant medications (specifically beta blockers); patient ability to perform self glucose monitoring and inject insulin accurately; risks and benefits of hypoglycemia, including psycho-social factors; and magnitude and pattern of hyperglycemia.
Type I Diabetes Insulin dosages vary widely among patients, even when other factors are similar.
For persons with new onset Type I diabetes, it is recommended that initial therapy be individualized in consultation with a Diabetes Team.
The dosages could then be increased by 2-6 units depending on body weight and glucose levels at the appropriate times.
Persons with Type I diabetes are, in general, more sensitive to changes in insulin dosage and far more susceptible to episodes of hypoglycemia than individuals with Type II diabetes.
In persons with Type I diabetes treated on intensive insulin regimens the risk of severe hypoglycemic reactions was increased by 300% in the context of a resource intensive controlled randomized trial (DCCT).
Such individuals should be managed in collaboration with a Diabetes Team.
For all patients, adjustments are best made in conjunction with SMBG (refer to Module GH) in the patient's normal environment.
Type II Diabetes Many patients with Type II diabetes can achieve target glycemic levels with bedtime insulin, a single injection of insulin, or split mixed insulin.
Some individuals with Type II diabetes, as well as individuals with Type I diabetes, will need intensive insulin treatment to achieve near normal glycemic target goals.
For these individuals regimens may include a short acting insulin before meals with Ultralente before breakfast and/or bedtime; intermediate and short acting insulin before breakfast, with short acting insulin 42
before dinner and an intermediate bedtime insulin.
For individuals with Type II diabetes, an American Diabetes Association publication notes that a safe way to begin insulin is to start with an arbitrary dose and increase it gradually until the desired level of control is achieved.
For lean persons (
Again, individual risks and benefits must be addressed.
In persons with Type II diabetes the VA Cooperative Study demonstrated that HbA1c results similar to the DCCT trial can be obtained in the veteran population, with no increase in weight and with minimal episodes of severe hypoglycemia.
However, this again was in the context of a resource intensive controlled trial with a subspecialty team, and it is recommended that such individuals also be comanaged in collaboration with a Diabetes Team.

Consider Insulin Therapy in Conjunction with an Oral Sulfonylurea2 In patients failing a maximal dose of sulfonylurea therapy, many patients can be convinced to start bedtime insulin daytime sulfonylurea (BIDS) because only one injection and one SMBG before breakfast are required.
If the target glycemic level is not achieved, then the use of multiple dosages of insulin should be considered.
For lean individuals, especially if elderly, 5-10 units of NPH insulin would be an appropriate range for starting bedtime insulin, while 10-15 units can be recommended for obese individuals.
Doses of insulin are best adjusted according to SMBG results obtained in the patient's usual environment.
Consider Metformin as Second Line Agent 1.
Recommendation Use as a second-line oral agent (in combination with an oral sulfonylurea at maximum dosage) in the event of oral sulfonylurea failure.
The effect of metformin on glycemic control should be additive, due to its different mechanism of action.
Efficacy in lowering HbA1c is comparable to oral sulfonylureas; the average maximum decrease in HbA1c is 2%.
Does not result in weight gain.
A reduction in plasma triglycerides may occur.
The patient should be advised of the transient, dose-related GI side effects (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, bloating, flatulence, anorexia).
Discontinue if testing of glycemic control fails to show improvement over 3 months.

Acarbose Has Limited Use 1.
Recommendation Due to its side-effect profile, multiple daily dosing regimen, and lower efficacy, this agent has limited indications.
Local medication use guidelines should be developed.
Suggestions for utilization: (a) Inadequately controlled patients (2% above HbA1c goal) who are unable to take sulfonylureas and/or metformin (allergies, adverse reactions, contraindications).
The effect of acarbose on glycemic control should be additive, due to its different mechanism of action; Patients inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea and metformin combination therapy, after discontinuation of metformin if the patient did not respond.
The addition of acarbose is used to avoid insulin therapy (although this may potentiate the hypoglycemic potential of these agents); Patients with elevated postprandial BS, or impaired glucose tolerance.
2.
(b)
(c) 3.
Its efficacy in lowering HbA1c is inferior to that of the oral sulfonylureas and metformin; the general maximum reduction in HbA1c is 0.5 - 1.0 %.

SMBG is widely used in persons with Type II diabetes not treated with insulin without substantial scientific evidence of efficacy.
Available data, based upon controlled studies, do not demonstrate that SMBG improves long term glycemic control in persons with Type II diabetes mellitus on oral medication.
In several studies urine testing was as effective as SMBG, although studies did not explicitly have patients trained to self-adjust medication.
Consequently, they do not exclude the possibility that selected patients, i.e., those who are highly motivated to alter their medication, diet and exercise regimen based upon SMBG results, could benefit from monitoring.
For all patients with diabetes, practitioners should ensure that patients demonstrate proficiency with the technique (See Module G, Annotation F) including transfer of blood from finger to strip and knowledge of quality control procedures if a meter is used.
If the provider does not have experience with SMBG, the patient should be referred to a diabetes educator.
In addition, providers should review SMBG results at regular visits or by telephone.
Urine testing should be considered as an alternative means of detecting hyperglycemia in patients who are not proficient with SMBG, or are not willing to make adjustments in medication or lifestyle based upon results.
Use of urine testing for this purpose presupposes that the renal threshold is normal.
58
Recommendations for SMBG* From VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management-Medical Advisory Panel, The Pharmacologic Management of Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus Patients on Oral Agents Â·
Patients on Insulin Alone
Â·
Â· a
For stable NIDDM: No more than 50 strips per 150 days.a This would allow for twice-weekly testing.
Increased numbers of strips may be needed for a limited time period for the following indications: 1) initiation of therapy and/or active adjustment of oral agents 2) prevention and detection of hypoglycemia when symptoms are suggestive, or if documented hypoglycemia unawareness 3) detection of hyperglycemia when symptoms or urine glycosuria are suggestive some patients do not require strips for adequate glucose control The frequency of monitoring should be individualized based on the frequency of insulin injections, hypoglycemic reactions, level of glycemic control, and patient/provider use of the data to adjust therapy A combination of pre and postprandial tests should be performed, up to 4 times per day
SMBG should be performed only if there is a specific justification for an individual patient, and a measurable health outcome is monitored on an ongoing basis.
2.
Patients who demonstrate consistent glucose results (stable patients) may require fewer or no strips.
When metabolic control worsens, testing requirements may increase.
Each provider must ascertain that the patient has proficiency in SMBG technique.
Initial and ongoing justification for SMBG use must be provided and should be linked to health outcomes.

Less than 2 times per week 2-3 times per week 3 or more times per week
Sedentary Moderately Active Highly Active
Physical Activity Recommendations (General) 3.
Physical activity of 10 minutes per session, several times a day can be recommended.
Physical activity may be incorporated in the patient's lifestyle or daily schedule.
It need not be regimented.
An attempt must be made to increase the patient's current level of physical activity.
Weight training can be recommended especially for patients who cannot or do not wish to walk/jog.
Weight training activities should allow all major groups of muscles to work.
Low weight/high repetitions should be stressed (reps: 20-30/set).
Activity (weight lifting) can be done several times a day, choosing a few exercises per session if patient cannot devote a lot of time at once.
Activities such as pushups, sit-ups, and handgrip exercises are also beneficial and should be recommended to the patient.

Cardiovascular Risk Evaluation The practitioner will evaluate the patient's cardiovascular history and physical exam, including: 1.
Evaluation should include a history directed towards risk or presence of peripheral vascular disease, including claudication, poor healing, amputation; cerebrovascular disease, including transient ischemic attacks and stroke; and coronary heart disease, including smoking, family history, hypertension, cholesterol (HDL to LDL ratio) and triglyceride, angina, MI, and arrhythmia.
63
C.
Identify and Manage if Cardiovascular Risks Present Depending upon results of the cardiovascular evaluation that is performed as part of a complete diabetes evaluation, the patient's age, and the proposed level of physical activity, it may be advisable to recommend diagnostic procedures for the presence of and/or severity of cardiovascular disease.
The necessity for, and extent of, such evaluation is at the discretion of the provider.
For further details one may want to refer to the Ischemic Heart Disease guideline.

Glycemic Control Target Value Achieved? It is evident that the risks of therapy are different for each individual, dependent upon his or her medical, social, and psychologic status.
Thus, the risks of a proposed therapy must be balanced against the potential benefits.
Factors for the provider and person with diabetes to consider in jointly making this decision should include the following: 1.
2.
Appropriate medical support and psychosocial environment.
History of severe, recurrent hypoglycemia.
64
3.
The possible consequence of adverse effects associated with hypoglycemia (consider CVD, anticoagulation, use of dangerous equipment, etc.)
Alcohol or substance abuse.
The presence of multiple end-stage microvascular complications, including macular edema, PDR, micro- and macroproteinuria.

MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS Routine Foot Care Annotations Module: FR A. Perform/Document Visual Inspection of the Feet -- Inspect for breaks in skin, erythema, trauma, pallor on elevation, dependent rubor, nail deformities, extensive callus and pitting edema.
Foot Risk Assessment Every diabetic individual needs a documented foot risk assessment within the past 12 months to determine their risk of lower extremity amputation.
Perform Foot Risk Assessment Include evaluation of skin for breakdown, assessment of protective sensation, lower extremity arterial disease, deformities, previous history of ulcers and amputations.
Assess the patient's footwear.
Limb-Threatening Condition? Signs and symptoms of systemic infection including gas gangrene, ascending cellulitis and lymphangitis or gangrene, no palpable pulses, signs of acute ischemia including rest pain, extreme pallor, or cold extremity.
Active Foot Ulcer or Infections? 1.
Active Foot Ulcer A cutaneous erosion with a loss of epithelium that extends to or through the dermis and can involve deeper tissue and is characterized by an inability to self-repair in a timely and orderly manner.
Active Infection Although infection is not always clinically apparent, common signs and symptoms include periulcer area warmth, erythema, purulent drainage, odor and involvement of bone.
Pain may or may not be present.
There may or may not be lymphangitis and lymphadenopathy, and the body temperature and white blood cell count may be elevated.

Yearly Foot Risk Assessment -- Every individual with diabetes must have had a documented foot risk assessment within the past 12 months to determine their risk of lower extremity amputation.
Visual Inspection and Peripheral Sensation Testing at Routine Primary Care Visits -- There is limited information, yet consensus exists in the diabetes professional community that visual inspection combined with peripheral sensation testing may reveal some occult lesions in diabetics.
This practice also demonstrates to the patient the importance of foot assessment.

Treatment Plan 1.
Refer to Foot Care Specialist for Intensive Follow-Up Plan A designated health care provider with training and interest in the management of traumatic, infectious, neoplastic, metabolic, acquired, and congenital disorders of the foot who utilizes medical, mechanical and/or surgical treatment modalities.
For prior above-ankle amputees refer to amputation algorithm.
Mechanical modalities may include footwear recommendations, and consideration of a footwear prescription will be based upon the individual structural and clinical findings.
Depth shoes should be prescribed for a patient with foot deformities and peripheral neuropathy as they can accept pressure-reducing insoles and accommodate foot deformities.
In-depth shoes usually have soft leather uppers paired with a crepe or Vibram outsole.
Custom-molded shoes are reserved for patients with foot deformities that cannot be accommodated in a depth shoe.
Persons with diabetes should avoid shoes with hard soles, since they do little to reduce plantar foot pressures.
Running shoes have been shown to reduce plantar pressures in individuals with diabetes; however, they may not accommodate foot deformities.

Implement Treatment per this Plan It is the responsibility of the foot care specialist to implement the patient care plan decided upon.
The foot care specialist may refer the patient to the primary care physician to implement and follow up on the specialist's plan.
Intensive Patient and Family Education Begin with an assessment of the patient's current self-care practices including asking "Do you do anything special to protect your feet?" Patient and family foot education should include the following components and considerations: a. b. Keep it simple and appropriate for patient's educational level.
Make it interactive, including demonstrations in washing, drying, and inspecting feet; nail cutting; and suitable footwear selection, including footwear for temperature extremes.
Provide opportunities for the patient to state the need for what are basics of daily skin and foot care and preventive measures.
Include practice time during the educational session to demonstrate and have the patient in return demonstrate safe toenail trimming.
Provide repetitive examples of and messages of how care of the feet can prevent complications.
Include recommendations that distinguish minor foot problems and more serious problems that require early or immediate professional treatment, together with a name and phone number for prompt assistance.
Make realistic recommendations (appropriate to the patient's physical and visual capabilities) while personalizing information and highlighting key points.
This may include referral to home health care.
Provide written guidelines in large print and/or graphics that the patient can hang in a bathroom as a reference, and reprints of lay articles.
Patients should be alerted that elevation in blood sugar may be a sign of an active 81

or impending infection.
Use of a night-light or turning on lights when getting up at night may prevent foot injuries.
Patients should be made aware of potential dangers in the home.
h.
For patients with high-risk feet, twice-daily inspection in good light is recommended, looking for any redness or drainage and running the hands over the foot to detect any swelling or increased local warmth.
Patients with neuropathic fingers may need to enlist help or use a mirror to inspect their feet.
Before donning footwear, inspect for torn linings, rough spots, and foreign materials, e.g., sand and stones.
Alternating between pairs of shoes during the day is recommended to alleviate repetitive local pressure.
A minimum of two serviceable pairs of shoes, insoles and orthoses are needed.
Educators can utilize numerous publications on patient foot care instruction that are free of charge and have no copyright restrictions.
Among them are: (1) Take Charge of Your Diabetes: Prevent Foot Problems, (2) Taking Care of Your Feet, (3) Tips on Good Foot Care from Feet Can Last a Lifetime.

Patients at high risk for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, rapid progression, or sight-threatening event should be seen on an urgent basis.
Patients who have new or worsening symptoms or are pregnant should be referred for re-evaluation even if they have had an eye examination within the past year.
Eye exam implies a comprehensive dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist and includes indirect and slit lamp ophthalmoscopy.
The primary care provider should confirm yearly that the patient is being followed with dilated eye examinations.
Non-dilated retinal examinations by providers other than eye care specialists are relatively insensitive in detecting retinopathy.
Frequency of causes of visual impairment in other than retinopathy older onset diabetic patients dictates a comprehensive eye exam.

Serum Creatinine Greater than 2.5 mg/dL Although the ADA recommends referral at 2 mg/dL, the consensus of our VA panel was that 2.5 mg/dL was more appropriate for our population.
Although the ADA recommends referral, when the GFR begins to decline substantially (
1.73m -2), difficulties in obtaining an accurate collection of a 24-hour urine precluded its recommendation as a routine test.

Any Nondiabetic Causes for Increased Protein? "Heavy exercise, urinary tract infection, acute febrile illnesses, and heart failure may transiently increase urinary albumin excretion; thus, screening should be postponed in these situations.
Similarly, drugs that may alter urinary protein excretion rate, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, should be avoided during screening."
(Bennett et al. 1995; ADA 1996).

Life Expectancy 
The NKF guidelines suggest stopping screening at age 70, but do not 116
give a justification for this cutoff point.
Consequently, an age cutoff point has been replaced with a life expectancy cutoff point instead.
The 1997 ADA recommendations acknowledge that the microalbuminuria is a less specific marker for development of overt diabetic nephropathy and ESRD in NIDDM, in part because of higher death rates from coronary artery disease.
They do not identify an age cutoff point for screening, however.
Mogensen (1987) showed that 20-25% of patients with Type II diabetes and microalbuminuria eventually go on to ESRD, compared with 80% of Type I patients, with the discrepancy primarily attributed to premature cardiovascular mortality.
Type II diabetic patients with microalbuminuria who progress to renal failure, progress more rapidly (i.e., years vs. decades) than those with Type I (Gall et al.1991; Ordonez

Systolic, mm Hg 
Diastolic, mm Hg 
TABLE OF EVIDENCE Variables Reference Strength of Recommendatio n I Level of Evidence C
Classification of BP in Adults
Rocella 1993
Not taking antihypertensive drugs and not acutely ill.
When systolic and diastolic pressure fall into different categories, the higher category should be selected to classify the individual's blood pressure status.
For instance, 160/92 mm Hg should be classified as stage 2, and 180/120 mm Hg should be classified as stage 4.
Isolated systolic hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and staged appropriately (e.g., 170/85 mm Hg is defined as stage 2 isolated systolic hypertension).
In addition to classifying stages of hypertension on the basis of average blood pressure levels, the clinician should specify presence or absence of target organ disease and additional risk factors.
For example, a patient with diabetes and a blood pressure of 142/94 mm Hg plus left ventricular hypertrophy should be classified as having "stage 1 hypertension with target organ disease (left ventricular hypertrophy) and with another major risk factor (diabetes)."
This specificity is important for risk classification and management.
Normal blood pressure with respect to cardiovascular risk is less than 120 mm Hg systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic.
However, unusually low readings should be evaluated for clinical significance.
The stages of hypertension are based on the average of two or more readings taken at each of two or more visits after an initial screening.

Consider Reduced Protein Diet From the ADA (1997): "In people with NIDDM and overt diabetic nephropathy, restriction of dietary protein has been shown to retard the progression to renal failure.
There is some evidence that this may also be true in NIDDM.
Therefore, a protein intake of approximately the adult recommended dietary allowance, 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day (less than 10% of calories), is recommended for individuals with evidence of macroalbuminuria.
In IDDM and NIDDM patients with microalbuminuria, there is inconclusive evidence that a low-protein diet slows the progression of nephropathy."
1.
Cardiovascular Risk Factor Reduction Persons with diabetes and with microalbuminuria are at high risk of developing macrovascular disease.
"At least three retrospective and three prospective studies have shown an increase in cardiovascular-related mortality in patients with Type II diabetes who have microalbuminuria.
In a prospective study performed by Mattock, after a mean follow-up of only 3.4 years, 28% of the group with microalbuminuria had died, and 80% of these deaths were due to cardiovascular conditions" (Murray 1996).
The ADA recommends aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia, smoking cessation, avoidance of a sedentary lifestyle, and blood pressure regulation (ADA 1994, 1995, 1997).
119
2.
Annual Serum Creatinine and Microalbuminuria The ADA (1994, 1995, 1997) and the NKF (Bennett et al. 1995) recommend this screening frequency.
L. Consider ACE Inhibitors and Monitor Urine Protein and Creatinine Evidence for ACE inhibitors being effective in Type II diabetes: At least one long-term (5 years) randomized, placebo-controlled trial in normotensive Type II diabetes patients showed a decrease in proteinuria (Ravid 1993).
However, while evidence for efficacy of ACE inhibitors in Type II diabetes in decreasing proteinuria is felt to be conclusive, their efficacy in chronic renal insufficiency remains to be determined.
1.
Frequency of Monitoring After Therapy The NKF: "After initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor, the efficacy of this intervention should be monitored by assessing the albumin creatinine ratio every 3 to 6 months.
Because the urine albumin excretion rate would be expected to increase by approximately 10% to 30% per year, stabilization of the albumin creatinine ratio or a reduction in this ratio by up to 50% should be expected."
It is also recommended to "check serum potassium and creatinine one week after initiation of therapy."

MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS Hypertension Management Annotations Module H Person with Diabetes Mellitus and High Blood Pressure Hypertension is defined by the 5th Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure and the following: CLASSIFICATION OF BLOOD PRESSURE FOR ADULTS AGED 18 YEARS AND OLDER* Systolic, mm/Hg Normal High Normal Hypertension++ Stage 1 (mild) Stage 2 (moderate) Stage 3 (severe) Stage 4 (very severe) +
A.
Diastolic, mm/Hg 
<
*Not taking anti-hypertensive drugs, not acutely ill.
When systolic and diastolic pressure fall into different categories, the higher category should be selected to classify the individual's blood pressure status.
For instance, 160/92 mm Hg should be classified as stage 2, and 180/120 mm Hg should be classified as stage 4.
Isolated systolic hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and staged appropriately (e.g., 170/85 mm Hg is defined as stage 2 isolated systolic hypertension).
In addition to classifying stages of hypertension on the basis of average blood pressure levels, the clinician should specify presence or absence of target-organ disease and additional risk factors.
For example, a patient with diabetes and a blood pressure of 142/94 mm Hg, plus left ventricular hypertrophy should be classified as having "stage 1 hypertension with target-organ disease (left ventricular hypertrophy) and with another major risk factor (diabetes)."
This specificity is important for risk classification and management.
+Optimal blood pressure with respect to cardiovascular risk is less than 120 mm Hg systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic.
However, unusually low readings should be evaluated for clinical significance.
++Based on the average of two or more readings taken at each of two or more visits after an initial screening.
TABLE OF EVIDENCE Strength of Recommendation I Level of Evidence C
Variables Reference Classification of BP in Rocella 1993 Adults
B.
Is Secondary Cause Suspected? The term "secondary hypertension" implies that a patient's blood pressure elevation is a result of an underlying discoverable disease process.
Secondary causes account for only a small percentage of all documented cases of hypertension, but their detection is important, as appropriate medical intervention may be curative and lead to reversal of hypertension.
129
Evaluate for features suggestive of rare secondary hypertension.
Suspect a diagnosis of secondary hypertension in patients with abrupt onset of symptomatic hypertension, sudden loss of blood pressure control after many years of stability on drug therapy, drug resistant hypertension, and in those individuals with no family history of hypertension.
Differential diagnosis of secondary hypertension includes: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·
Thyroid disease (hyper- or hypo-) Cushing's syndrome Pheochromocytoma Primary aldosteronism Renovascular disease Renal parenchymal disease Aortic coarctation Intracerebral pathology
C.
Order Additional Work-up Early discussion or consultation with an appropriate subspecialist may lead to the most accurate and cost-effective work-up.
Clinical Findings: Recommended Test/Referral: Features of reno-vascular hypertension: Initial onset age 50 years or older Diastolic blood pressure higher than 115 mm Hg Hemorrhages and exudates in the fundi Presence of abdominal bruit over renal arteries Diminishing blood pressure control Signs of arterial narrowing Women of child-bearing age Features of pheochromocytoma: There is a relative contraindication to IVPs in persons with diabetes, so they are not recommended.
There is no single test for reno-vascular hypertension.
Consult experts in your institution.
There are a variety of screening tests for reno-vascular hypertension, depending on equipment and expertise in institutions.
Paroxysms Headaches Palpitations Perspiration
24-hour urine for metanephrines.
Repeat with urinary catecholamines if metanephrines are normal or your suspicions are high.
Consider referral to expert.
Pallor
Extremely labile blood pressure Cushingoid features Low serum potassium in absence of diuretics on two occasions Isolated proteinuria on two occasions Elevated serum creatinine, abnormal urine sediment, hematuria on two occasions or structural renal abnormality 1
24-hour urine for free cortisol Consider primary aldosteronism and referral to Nephrology or Endocrinology 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine clearance Consider referral to Nephrology

Regular Physical Activity a.
Minimum Goal Â· Â· Â·
Â·
Regular physical activity Small increase over current level Progression to level that achieves cardiovascular fitness (e.g., 30 minutes of brisk walking most days of the week) Muscular strengthening and joint flexibility
b.
Recommendations (1) Essential components of a systematic, individualized exercise prescription include the appropriate mode, intensity, duration, frequency, and progression of physical activity.
Assess risk, preferably with exercise test to guide prescription.
Advise medically supervised programs for moderate to high-risk patients.
131
(2) (3)
(4)
Consider level of fitness, medications that may influence heart rate, risk of cardiovascular or orthopedic injury, individual preferences, and individual program objectives.
Encourage minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of moderate intensity activity, 3 to 4 times weekly (e.g., walking, jogging, cycling or other aerobic activity) supplemented by an increase in daily lifestyle activities (e.g., walking breaks at work, using stairs, gardening, household work).
Minimum benefit, 5 to 6 hours per week.
Light to moderate physical activity requires sustained, rhythmic muscular movements, is equivalent to sustained walking, performed at less than 60% of maximum heart rate for age.
Maximum heart rate equals roughly 220 beats per minute minus age.

National High Blood Pressure Education Program: a.
ACE inhibitors, alpha-receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, and diuretics in low doses are preferred because of fewer adverse effects on glucose homeostasis, lipid profiles, and renal function.
Beta-blockers can have adverse effects on peripheral blood flow, prolongation of hypoglycemia, and masking of hypoglycemic symptoms.
137
b.
c.
If proteinuria or renal disease is present (go to Module R), consider ACE inhibitor as first choice for hypertension.
If coronary artery disease is present, beta-blocker therapy should be considered.

Evaluate Fasting TC/TG/LDL-C/HDL These lipids must be measured in the fasting state because serum triglycerides (TG) are affected by meals and, if elevated above about 400 mg/dL, interfere with the calculation of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C).
Below this TG value, the calculation works reasonably well (Demacker et al. 1996; Nauck et al. 1996; Whiting et al. 1997).
If the TG level is 
If measurements of LDL-C and HDL-C are not available, serum total cholesterol can be measured in the fed or fasting state; however, the recommendation here is to measure LDL-C.
The reason for measuring serum lipids in Type II diabetes is because dyslipidemia is common (Laakso, 1996) and a raised level of serum cholesterol is as powerful a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with Type II diabetes as it is in non-diabetics (Pyorala, 
A major problem is that there are no data to show that reversal of dyslipidemia in Type II diabetes results in primary prevention of CHD (Laakso, 1996), and only post-hoc subgroup analysis from larger trials (4S, CARE) suggests that it leads to secondary prevention of a second CHD event (Kreisberg, 1996; Sacks et al. 1996).
There may be benefit of a global program that addresses serum cholesterol, smoking, and hypertension, with the use of aspirin, in men under age 60 years but these approaches may have less effect in Type II diabetes than non-diabetics (Krolewski et al. 1996).
It is known that lipid-lowering therapies are effective at lowering serum cholesterol in Type II diabetes (Behounek et al. 1994; Sweany et al. 1995).
On balance, it is reasonable to conclude that one can use about the same approach to dyslipidemia in Type II diabetes as in those without Type II diabetes until large-scale diabetes-specific data are available.
See Attachment 1, Drugs that alter plasma lipids from the VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management Medical Advisory Panel Guidelines at the end of this chapter.
Also, refer to Attachments 2 and 3, Drug Interactions and Costs for Hyperlipidemia Drug Therapy.
In persons without diabetes there is benefit of lowering serum cholesterol in both primary (Pedersen 1994) and secondary prevention of CHD (Sacks et al. 1996; Shepherd et al. 1995).
Note: This algorithm does not address the issue of a low HDL-C without a raised LDL-C because niacin, which is effective at raising the low HDL-C, should be avoided in Type II diabetes (see annotation D) and gemfibrozil, which can also 161
raise HDL-C, is currently under study in a VA Cooperative Study to see if CHD outcomes are actually affected.

Is LDL-C 
However, in persons without diabetes but with a recent (3 months to 20 months) history of myocardial infarction, the treatment benefit decreased to zero as the LDL-C level approached 125 mg/dL.
Based upon this result, the cutpoint for treatment for either primary or secondary prevention should be set at 125-130 mg/dL, unless a person has had coronary bypass surgery.
In this group of individuals (Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Trial Investigators), aggressive lowering of LDL-C levels to below 100 mg/dL reduced the progression of atherosclerosis in grafts.
However, the study was not designed to have adequate power to detect treatment-related differences in clinical events.
There was no significant difference in composite and points (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke), although there was a nonsignificant trend (p=0.03) towards fewer revascularization procedures.

Is TSH High? Values of serum TSH 
Primary hypothyroidism, which becomes symptomatic at raised serum TSH levels of about 10 mU/L and can affect serum lipids at less elevated values, affects only a small number of those with raised serum cholesterol but is quite treatable.
Screening for primary hypothyroidism in those without Type II diabetes is reasonably cost-effective (Danese et al. 1996) and this is probably true in Type II diabetes as well.

More importantly, changes in lifestyle, e.g., smoking cessation, can decrease the global risk of CHD even without a change in the serum cholesterol level (Avins 
This stratified approach targets the use of lipid-lowering drugs to those at higher risk (Ramsey et al. 1996), an approach which is particularly useful in view of the need for cost effectiveness and the uncertainty of translating efficacy ("it can work") to effectiveness ("it actually does work in practice") (Marchioli et al. 1996).

Provide Gemfibrozil The practitioner here has the choice of: (a) going on to the use of a "statin" drug and assessing the effect on the TG level before addressing the raised TG level directly OR (b) instituting therapy with gemfibrozil which will usually lower the raised TG. 165
Niacin, which is effective in lowering both a raised TG and a raised LDL-C, is avoided here because of its tendency to raise the serum glucose.
However, it could be tried with caution in selected cases.

Because the response of LDL-C to statin drugs is partly dose-dependent, reassessment of the serum LDL-C in one to three months will help guide therapy.
Further, most side effects of these drugs occur in the first few months.
The main side effect, which occurs in two to three percent, is hepatic dysfunction; hepatic enzyme measurements once or twice in the first three months of therapy and every three or four months thereafter in the first year of therapy will generally detect this.
If there is no hepatic dysfunction as a result of the drug, one can re-assay these enzymes once or twice a year.
The much rarer muscle dysfunction due to these drugs (
