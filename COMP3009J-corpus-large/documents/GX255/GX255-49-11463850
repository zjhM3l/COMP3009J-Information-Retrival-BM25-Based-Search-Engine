July -- the month of Independence
By Command Chief Betty L G Morgan
Aren't you happy that you are a citizen of the United States of America? Where else in the world can you do what you do with little or no strings attached...You are allowed to go places without an escort or punching in and out.
You can choose the school of education that you would like for your child(ren) to attend.
There are malls, restaurants, recreational areas, churches, theme parks, etc., for you to plan a vacation.
You have the right to vote on a specific issue.
It is a country that you can choose which way you would like to cast your vote for a particular candidate or referendum.
You are free to express your opinions through newspaper, television, or radio.
You have the right to make the decision of joining one of the branches of the military.
No one will put your young son of fourteen (14) on the front line to fight for his country.
If not the military, you have the right to choose the college or vocational track once you graduate from high school.
Being independent rather than dependent is always a better choice.
Just think, if you had to wait until someone made the decision of what you can or cannot do.
Imagine not being able to select your own bride or groom; imagine not being able to get medical attention when sickness occurs; imagine not being able to feed your family on a daily basis.
Living in the USA gives everyone an opportunity to advance themselves through education.
No one has to remain in any one status.
There are just too many avenues to take to be stuck in a tunnel where there is no sign of light.
As we continue to fight for our freedom and hopefully to bring our troops back home safely, keep these words in mind: "We love the United States of America.
We like the way we all live without fear.
We like to vote for our choice; speak our minds, raise our voices -- yes we like it here.
We like to climb to the top of the mountain so high, lift our heads to the sky and say how grateful we are, for the way that we're living, working and giving, helping the land we hold dear, yes, we like it here.
GOD BLESS AMERICA! __________________________________________________________________

News from the 530th Air Force Band
The Air National Guard Band of the South spent nine days this summer perfecting their performances and sharing the entertaining results with large and appreciative audiences in and around the Savannah, Georgia area.
The traditional guard musicians of the Air National Guard Band of the South, which is connected to the Georgia Air National Guard Headquarters at Dobbins ARB in Atlanta, Georgia came together at the end of June and began rehearsals for all of the band's various ensembles.
All of the thirty-four members of the band perform in the concert band.
This ensemble includes traditional military band music such as marches and patriotic music, but they are also quite capable of performing the challenging literature that has been written for concert band.
The band also contains within its ranks a superb eighteen-member jazz ensemble called Eagle's Flight, an innovative twelve-member rock/fusion band called Sound Barrier, a Dixieland ensemble, brass quintet, woodwind quintet, protocol ensemble, a flute ensemble, and even a solo bagpiper.
It goes without saying that for thirty-four musicians to create that much diversity in a variety of musical mediums, there must be many talented, flexible people in the Air National Guard Band of the South.
The first performance for the summer drill took place at St Peter's Episcopal Church in Savannah, Georgia as part of their summer concert series.
A crowd of over 300 (there were audience members sitting in the window sills) enjoyed an evening of fantastic jazz, traditional patriotic music, and bagpipe music highlighted by an emotional performance of Amazing Grace.
Band member SSgt Roberta Textor's parents attend this church and the audience was also able to take part in a brief ceremony in which SSgt Textor was awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal for her service to the band, the Air National Guard, and the United States Air Force.
The band next performed on Johnson Square in the historic center of Savannah, Georgia.
Eagle's Flight took charge for this concert and by the end of the afternoon TSgt Margaret Haack, leader of the group, had accumulated quite a large audience of not only people who had come out to hear the group, but also those who had just been walking by and decided to stop and hear more.
On July 3, 2003, the Air National Guard Band of the South performed for hundreds of people celebrating Independence Day on Tybee Island.
The three larger ensembles, the concert band, Eagle's Flight, and Sound Barrier, kept audiences entertained for over two hours until the fireworks began.
This performance was also the unveiling of Sound Barrier's performance of YMCA with SSgt Brent Whittaker wowing the crowd with his voice and his costume!
For the final performance for summer drill the band performed, despite threatening rain, on River Street in Savannah, Georgia.
Once again, hundreds of people were treated to the concert band's patriotic line-up and Sound Barrier's rocking performance of such classics as Rescue Me and the band's personal favorite, The Chicken.
TSgt Andrew Traugot, the band's leader, took the audience's festive spirit to heart and debuted the band's premiere performance of Love Shack.
This performance did not include costumes, but the audience loved it anyway!
Many thanks go to Colonel Wexler and the 165th for requesting and hosting the Air National Guard Band of the South for these performances.

National Guard, State, Local Agencies Join in Homeland Defense Drill
The Georgia National Guard in coordination with more than eight other federal and state emergency agencies and local first responders conducted a major statewide homeland defense exercise on Saturday, July 12, 2003 at the Port of Savannah.
The operation, which represented one of the largest combined homeland defense exercises conducted in the state, took place over several hours on Saturday morning and concluded early Saturday afternoon.
The purpose of the exercise was to refine, rehearse and validate homeland security plans for providing military support for civil authorities.
Brigadier General Scott Hammond represented Major General Wick Searcy as the Air Guard representative at the exercise while Maj. Manny Haldopolouos was at the Dobbins operations desk overseeing Air Guard participation.
The scenario was developed from simulated intelligence reports that indicated that Al Qaida operatives had placed a explosive device in a sea container that had been off loaded at the Port of Savannah.
Members of the the Georgia National Guard Civil Support Team where charged with locating and determining the nature of the device.
In coordination with Savannah police, fire and Chatham County bomb squad organizations, the device was located and destroyed without major incident.
The Port of Savannah was only one of more than ten other critical areas around the state where National Guard Quick Reaction Forces were deployed on Saturday.
More than 600 soldiers and airmen were involved in exercise.
Observing the exercise were legislative representatives from all the Georgia congressional offices.
"This was an example of excellent cooperation between all federal, state and local agencies, all who have a role in our homeland defense,"said Maj Gen David Poythress, Georgia's TAG.
" Such exercises help us to identify areas of responsibility and coordinate an effective response when called upon to do so."
