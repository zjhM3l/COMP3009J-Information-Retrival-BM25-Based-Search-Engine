T HE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF VIRGINIA This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Geological Survey and theVirginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.
In 1997, Virginia remained 22d in rank among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value,1 according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The estimated value for 1997 was $600 million, about a 9% increase from that of 1996.
This followed a 6.6% increase from 1995 to 1996 (based on final 1996 data).
The State accounted for 1.5% of the U.S. total nonfuel mineral production value.
Virginia mines produce industrial minerals and coal.
The last significant metal production took place in 1981 when the State's only consistently active metal mine, an underground zinc operation, closed down because of the recession and a depressed metal market.
While a diverse variety of minerals was produced in Virginia in 1997, crushed stone accounted for 65% of the State's nonfuel mineral value.
From 1990 through 1997, Virginia produced more than 430 million metric tons of crushed stone, or an average of almost 54 million metric tons per year.
In 1997, the value of crushed stone increased by about $41 million, the most of any nonfuel mineral in the State; construction sand and gravel also had a significant increase (table 1).
Crude gypsum and talc showed small decreases; gemstones, crude iron oxide pigments, and industrial sand and gravel remained unchanged.
In 1996, crushed stone accounted for the largest portion of the State's increase in mineral value; lime, construction sand and gravel, masonry cement, and kyanite also contributed to the rise in value.
Portland cement production and value dropped by about 11%.
Based on USGS estimates of quantities produced in the 50 States during 1997, Virginia remained the only State to mine kyanite; second of 2 States that produce vermiculite; third in feldspar; fourth in crude iron oxide pigments; and ninth in lime.
The State climbed in rank to seventh from eighth in the production of crushed stone.
Additionally, significant quantities of masonry cement and common clays were produced in the State.
While the only producing kyanite mine in the United States was in Virginia, mullite, a calcined kyanite, was synthetically produced in one other State.
About 90% of U.S. kyanite and mullite output is used in refractories for the smelting and processing of a variety of metals and in glass and high1 The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 1997 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are estimates as of January 1998.
For some commodities (for example, construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement), estimates are updated periodically.

The following narrative information was provided by the Virginia Division of Mineral Resources (VDMR).2 A division of Ralston Purina Co., Golden Cat, began producing cat box filler, during the summer, at its new manufacturing plant, located about 25 miles northeast of Richmond.
The plant uses fuller's earth from King and Queen County.
In mid-October, RGC (USA) Mineral Sands, Inc. officially opened its titanium mining and processing operations in the town of Stony Creek, Dinwiddie County, south of Richmond.
The company has invested almost $50 million in the operation; the processing and mining operations have created 70 jobs, and hauling and supply services and contract mining operations have created an additional 25 jobs.
Vulcan Materials Co., Winston Salem, NC, announced in the fall the reopening of its Low Moor Quarry in Alleghany County.
This quarry, located in Middle Ordovician limestones in the western part of the State, in the past produced roadstone, asphalt stone, and riprap.
The VDMR continued geologic mapping in several counties at a detailed (1:24,000) scale and continued to map, compile, and digitize 1:100,000-scale maps.
The agency also continued field studies and compilation of mineral resources on 1:24,000 scale maps; a coalbed methane resources study; oil and gas studies of Dickenson and Russell Counties; a paper updating byproduct resources in the State; articles on clay deposits in Augusta and Rockbridge Counties; and a history of brick production in the Albemarle County and City of Charlottesville area.
Published during the year were two statistics reports on coal, oil and gas, and industrial and metallic mineral resources produced in the State for 1995-96.
Additional work included a study on ancient warm springs deposits in Bath and Rockingham Counties; a report on the metallic mines, prospects, and occurrences in the gold-pyrite belt of Virginia; a geologic map of the Roanoke 30 x 60-minute quadrangle; a report on Virginia's coal ages; and a brochure on the "Geology of Virginia."
During the year, two brochures, "Virginia Diamonds" and "Gold in Virginia," were revised.
The Division continued to move forward with implementation of digital mapping technology, with the intent being to make data available to customers in computer-ready formats and to reduce map printing and storage costs by printing maps "on-demand."
Many topographic maps and several geologic maps are already available in digital form, and many other products were being prepared.
Complete State topographic coverage is available as Digital Raster Graphics, referred to as DRG's.
These color-compressed, georeferenced raster images of USGS topographic maps are at 2 Palmer Sweet, Head Geologist with the VDMR, authored the text of mineral industry information submitted by that agency.
VIRGINIA--1997 1 1:24,000, 1:100,000, and 1:250,000 scales.
For the coal-bearing portion of Virginia, all 1:24,000-scale topographic maps have been vectorized and are available on CD-ROM.
A program to vectorize topographic contours for the remaining quadrangles in the Commonwealth is in the planning stage.
Many published geologic maps are undergoing digitization, and some newer maps are being produced by digital processes, completely bypassing conventional printing.
For example, a new geologic overview map of the Southwest Virginia Coalfields will be available as a digital dataset or as a "map-on-demand."
The Division has worked closely with suppliers of plotter media to develop and test papers and inks that will stand up to the rigors of field use.
