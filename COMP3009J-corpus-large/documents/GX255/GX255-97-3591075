ALMIS will not replace aviation's present systems (AMMIS and ACMS), but will add functionality to them, and provide additional new functionality.
ALMIS consists of several projects, including the Electronic Aircraft Logbook, Decision Support System, ALMIS Unified Architecture, and Business Area Analysis.
ALMIS WILL PROVIDE MANAGERS AND TECHNICIANS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO STEER LOGISTICS DECISION MAKING.
CURRENTLY THE UNDERLYING MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FRAMEWORK FOR AVIATION LOGISTICS PROCESSES IS LIMITED TO ON LINE TRANSACTION PROCESSING (OLTP).
UNDER THIS FORMAT EACH AD-HOC REPORT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE EFFORT (THOUSANDS OF HOURS) TO CONSTRUCT.
THE CURRENT SYSTEM'S INFLEXIBILITY IS A CONSTRAINT TO TIMELY AND EFFICIENT LOGISTICS DECISIONS.
SEVERAL REDUNDANT PAPER-BASED BUSINESS PROCESSES WHICH SURROUND THE CURRENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAN BE ELIMINATED.
CURRENTLY, PERFORMING SENSITIVE ANALYSIS OF LOGISTICS ISSUES IS DIFFICULT.
GATHERING THE FACTS TO FORMULATE REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES IS TIME CONSUMING AND OFTEN NOT TO THE DEPTH REQUIRED TO MITIGATE THE RISK AND COST OF SUBOPTIMAL DECISIONS.

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (AMMIS) (FORMERLY IDENTIFIED AS IN DOT DATABASE)
DESCRIPTION: The Coast Guard maintains a Management Information Services Division at the Aircraft Repair
and Supply (ARSC) in Elizabeth City, NC.
This facility supports and maintains the Aviation Maintenance Management Information System (AMMIS), among other duties.
The AMMIS system is central to the logistical support of aviation assets.
AMMIS provides requisitioning, wholesale and retail inventory management, procurement, fiscal accounting, disbursing, warehousing, shipping, receiving, aircraft flight and operations tracking, pilot and aircrew training and qualification tracking, and flight pay reporting.
AMMIS is the primary inventory management tool used by ARSC and all Coast Guard Air Stations.
AMMIS data is also accessed by Districts, Areas and CGHQ.
AMMIS supports all of Coast Guard aviation.
Since Coast Guard Aviation operates on a centrally controlled inventory model, all logistical functions are directed by ARSC.
AMMIS allows air stations to readily requisition material to meet operational commitments.
ARSC is able to track the location of parts and to determine the appropriate quantity of material to retain in inventory and to procure.
Total Asset Visibility (TAV) is achieved through an integrated relational database which shows location of all Coast Guard owned aviation spare parts whether at ARSC or at the various air stations.
Real-time fiscal accounting is achieved through a relational database that requires single-point entry to create a financial transaction associated with each inventory transaction.
Industrial accounting for the ARSC workforce is tracked and used to compute actual aircraft depot-maintenance support costs through a work order system.
AMMIS also tracks aviation operational data including resource and employment hours for input to the Abstract of Operations.
Certifications of flight pay are calculated from this data.
The system also tracks training and qualification of aviation personnel.
This operational data, combined with logistical data, allows managers to analyze the impact of logistics on operations and the reverse.

DESCRIPTION: In the mid-1980's, the Coast Guard Intelligence Program entered into a joint venture with the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) to improve maritime data sharing.
That joint venture resulted in the establishment of the Joint Maritime Information Element (JMIE) program.
JMIE is a consortium of government agencies whose business/operations share a common theme - they are involved in maritime operations.
The consortium's business is overseen by the JMIE Steering Group (JSG) which is made up of the heads of the consortium's members.
As a first effort in improving the sharing of maritime data, the JSG directed that the JMIE Support System (JSS) be developed.
The JSS consists of a centralized database maintained on a high capacity SUN Sparc Server at the National Maritime Intelligence Center in Suitland, MD.
The database is accessed via WEB based technology supported by the DISA's Secret Wide-Area Network, SIPRNet.
Currently, there are over 50 locations worldwide accessing the database.
JSS users include Coast Guard Intelligence offices, other US Law Enforcement, Intelligence, and Military commands, as well as other US government agencies.
The original JSS design reached Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 1993 and was transitioned from its original IBM architecture to its current SUN architecture in 1999.
By Memorandum of Agreement, the Office of Naval Intelligence functions as the Technical Management Office (TMO), the Assistant Commandant for Operations (Office of Intelligence) serves as the JMIE Executive Agent is also responsible for JSS Operations

DESCRIPTION: The Commercial SATCOM initiative provides funding for Coast Guard mobile units use of Commercial Satellite communications.
It also supports maintenance, and upgrades to the commercial satellite terminals installed on Coast Guard mobile assets.
A major initiative to upgrade our existing Commercial SATCOM capabilities which commenced in FY99 is included in this project.
The project also funds a few shore based terminals in support of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).
SATCOM provides command, control and communication (C3) of Coast Guard cutters and contingency forces as well as interoperability with commercial vessels equipped with satellite communications in accordance with GMDSS amendments to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention.
SATCOM supports all Coast Guard missions.
Commercial SATCOM supports improved business practices by providing highly reliable, wide-area voice and data communications.
Future SATCOM initiatives are planned to provide a secure capability to this communication path and offset the rising cost of the current communications infrastructure, High Frequency (HF) Radio and International Maritime Satellite
(INMARSAT) user costs through capital investment in new state-of-the-art technology.
Expansion of the commercial SATCOM path to aircraft will improve existing air to ground communications and allow closure of the Air to Ground positions at Communications Stations.
SATCOM users can currently direct dial to any telephone on the public switched network using today's existing INMARSAT capabilities.
The upgrade initiative will replace High Frequency Data Link (HFDL) which provides the 110' cutter fleet with record message traffic and will facilitate closure of the HFDL positions at Communication Stations.
SATCOM will directly benefit the Law Enforcement, Search and Rescue, Intelligence, and Logistics programs by providing a rapid and reliable communications path at a reasonable cost.
Installation of satellite communications will afford the Coast Guard the first step towards possible retirement of significant HF based infrastructure and substantial resource savings in FTE and support costs.
Use of new technology will allow the Coast Guard to take advantage of the cost savings resulting from competition in the commercial SATCOM market.
Competition among the satellite service providers will drive the cost of service from the current $5.90/minute to $1.50/min or less.
This will allow the mobile platforms to utilize the commercial satellite communications path to its fullest potential at less cost per platform.
Data communications, to accommodate tactical C2 and support needs, is identified as a critical gap in the Coast Guard communications infrastructure as listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) Baseline Architecture (COMDTINST 3090.6).
This current gap will become a larger problem in future Coast Guard operations due to an increasing need for information exchange from or to mobile units, and the inability of HF to support large digital data transmission rates due to insufficient bandwidth.
Law Enforcement: The Law Enforcement program is currently the largest user of INMARSAT.
At least five of the critical gaps, related to Law Enforcement communications capabilities identified in COMDTINST 3090.6, paragraph 9.5.1.1., can be bridged by installation of commercial SATCOM equipment on cutters and aircraft.
These critical gaps include: - The lack of reliable connectivity between cutters, aircraft and operational shore facilities, especially at extended ranges.
- The lack of an effective interface for exchanging information between larger Coast Guard platforms that support the Enforcement of Laws and Treaties (ELT) mission and Shore facilities (Districts) and smaller platforms (WPBs).
- The limited ability to effectively exchange sensor, intelligence and other tactical information between aircraft, mobile units and shore facilities.
- The lack of high speed, reliable communications between mobile assets and operational support information to assist in or which is mission essential for the execution of the ELT/Maritime Law Enforcement (MLE) mission.
- The generally cumbersome interfaces available for using Coast Guard Command and Control/Communications systems.
Search and Rescue: COMDTINST 3090.6, paragraph 4.5.1.1, identifies critical gaps in communications capability related to Search and Rescue (SAR) which a commercial SATCOM capability would be logical and cost effective solution.
Specific communications requirements which could be addressed by commercial SATCOM, as listed in COMDTINST 3090.6 are: - OPCEN controllers shall have secure or non-secure voice communications with On Scene
Commanders.
- Conduct On Scene Commander (OSC) functions, including coordination of Surface Resource Unit (SRU) response, monitoring of SRU performance, adoption of SAR Action Plan to on scene conditions and incident development, and communicating with the SAR Mission Coordinator in real time.
- Communicate in real or near time, in all modes (Voice, data, video), with Coast Guard resources and all appropriate federal, state and local agencies and maritime public while CONTACT: LT Len Sheltry, 202-267-6837 OA: INITIATIVE ID: FY-2000: FY-2001: FY-2002: USCG USCGO030 $750 $750 $750 TITLE: SHIPBOARD COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM - 270 (SCCS-270) DESCRIPTION: C2CEN previously supported two separate C2 systems on the WMEC-270 Famous-class cutters: COMmand, Display 
Naval Tactical Command System - Afloat (NTCS-A): Provided the over-the-horizon tactical picture for CIC and joint operations.
The COMDAC system was based on late 1970's proprietary technology, obsolete hardware, and became more difficult and costly to support.
A feasibility study in 1993 identified that a completely new system could be designed, procured and installed on all 13 WMEC-270 class cutters to replace COMDAC by simply reprogramming existing annual COMDAC support money.
In addition, the new system would combine the local organic navigation system with the over-the-horizon tactical picture resulting in one powerful system that increases functionality and efficiency on the bridge and in CIC while reducing annual maintenance and support costs.
As part of a multiyear budgetary strategy, C2CEN proposed replacing COMDAC with modern tactical computers based on the Navy's JMCIS architecture.
On 24 March 1994, COMDT (G-CCS) approved the project and work began on replacing COMDAC and integrating the organic and over-the-horizon command and control systems.
In the Summer of 1996, the US Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) Navigation Sensor System Interface (NAVSSI) project team abandoned a costly navigation display system project and signed a memorandum of agreement with C2CEN to jointly develop the SCCS-270 navigation software and to expand its use for all USCG WMEC/WHEC class cutters and all NAVSSI designated platforms.
The first NAVSSI systems employing the SCCS-270 navigation software will undergo operational evaluation during summer 2000.
The US Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) New Fast Attack Submarine Program (NSSN) joined the development team in 1997.
The NSSN program office will use the SCCS-270 navigation software on the Virginia-class submarines scheduled for launch in 2004.

DESCRIPTION: The combat and tactical information system on WHEC-378 Hamilton-class cutters was an outdated collection of equipment which had problems associated with its age and limited automated functionality.
The hardware was antiquated, processing command and control activities required many crewmembers, and there was no automated information integration.
SCCS-378 upgraded the combat and tactical information equipment on all WHEC-378 cutters using state of the art COTS-based information technology and available DOD Defense Information Infrastructure - Common Operating Environment (DII-COE) provided software.
Additional Coast Guard unique software segments were developed to provide complete automated functionality.
With the completion of all installations, the program has entered the life cycle support stage and centers on fixing system trouble reports, implementing new enhancements via system improvement reports, and training crews on system operation, administration, and maintenance.

CMMTdb is an office and program management tool for legal program managers use in the management of their staff and office work.
It also serves as resource management tool for the Chief Counsel and senior managers in exercising oversight of the legal program.
The current LAWSdb was written in Application Development System (ADS) for the CTOS computer equipment.
With the transition to CGSWIII the LAWSdb is not compatible and is being replaced by CMMT which is an ORACLE based database accessed through the WEB.
The CMMTdb is one of the 18 "Mission Essential Applications".
If not funded, it would be necessary for attorneys to revert back to manual processes.
Turnaround times for legal materials would increase significantly.
A large number of additional support personnel would be required.
Attorneys and their supervisors would be less effective in managing individual and office workload.
There would be no electronic sources of workload data for measurement by the program manager.
Legal research would be more time consuming, possibly less thorough, and possibly inconsistent.

OA: INITIATIVE ID: FY-2000: FY-2001: FY-2002: USCG USCGO043 $450 $450 $450 TITLE: MERCHANT MARINER LICENSING AND DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM (MMLD) DESCRIPTION: The Merchant Mariner Licensing and Documentation (MMLD) system automates the various marine licensing and documentation processes including recordkeeping of merchant mariners of the United States.
The records include the documentation, license and employment information on each U.S. mariner and World War II Merchant Mariner Veteran's Status information (DD 214 program).
The manual system which has been in effect since 1937, was extremely labor intensive and provided very slow response to inquiries for information from these records.
An automated system for Coast Guard Headquarters, the Merchant Mariner's Documentation (MMDOC) system has been on line since 1991 and has improved our ability to respond to the public with information needed to assist mariners.
In 1996, MMDOC and MMLD were combined into one national database to be used by all Regional Examination Centers (RECs).
The database is updated daily with new/additional information on mariners to include name, address, and social security number; date/place and rating of a Merchant Mariner's Document (MMD) LICENSE; and the location of the record.
In 1999, MMLD was transported to Workstation III and upgraded to a web-enabled application.
It is presently located and maintained at the Operations Systems Center in Kearneysville, WV.
As part of the MMLD system, the Coast Guard developed a Mariner's Tracking system which will provide valuable information to the Maritime Administration and Department of Defense for the manning of merchant vessels in times of national emergency.
The information in MMLD is also used in Coast Guard investigations of marine casualties, violations, and negligence; in Department of Justice litigation; in Department of Defense manning of the Ready Reserve Fleet in time of national emergency; and to provide information to mariners and unions regarding retirement benefits.
An element of MMLD is the Mariner's Identification (MID) system which replaces the paper-based Merchant Mariner's Document (MMD) with a plastic credit card style ID with magnetic stripe to allow automating a 60 year old manual reporting system.
This is a micro computer based ID card production (with camera and card printer) with COTS equipment with an interface developed to tie the system to CGSW.
The system is used on the national and local level.

NPFC administers the
Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) that supports OPA activities, and the Coast Guard portion of the Superfund that supports the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).
These laws deal with liability, compensation, and other fiscal matters stemming from threatened or actual oil or hazardous substance releases.
To meet these ends, the NPFC executes programs that: * Provide funding to permit timely removal actions; initiate Natural Resource Damage assessments; and compensate claimants who demonstrate that certain damages were caused by oil pollution; * Recover pollution costs and damages incurred by the Fund from responsible parties; and * Certify the financial responsibility of vessel owners and operators.
NPFC receives intense scrutiny by Congress, GAO, OMB, DOT, Responsible Parties (RPs), their guarantors, the shipping and oil industries, other federal agencies, States, claimants, On-Scene Coordinators, and other internal and external customers.
NPFC's Expert Management Information System (NEMIS) is the overarching information system that supports the business lines of NPFC.
Currently under phased development, NEMIS provides the platform by which case team members can interactively participate during the prosecution of pollution cases.
It provides a system for the management of the vessel certification function and the adjudication of third party claims.
NEMIS provides the platform for NPFC's Intranet by which all NPFC employees have access to NPFC's Strategic Business Plan, internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Coast Guard and NPFC instructions, executive information, policy and legal guidance, and other shared data.
It permits the management staff to measure and analyze statistics for the purposes of internal and external reporting, IG audit preparation and workload reallocation and distribution.
NEMIS provides tools through which NPFC progress toward GPRA goals can be measured and evaluated; tools which are critical to accomplishing our Total Quality Initiatives, especially for providing superior customer service through continuous process improvement.
The scope of NEMIS is significant in that it supports NPFC's management of the $1B Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and every source of income and expense coming into and out of the Fund.
Since 1990, the NPFC has managed income into the Fund totaling $2B from five primary sources: the $.05 per barrel oil tax, fines and penalties, interest on Treasury investments, transfers from existing funds, and recoveries from responsible parties.
The NPFC also provided oversight over $1.0 billion in expenditures from the Fund from FY90 through FY99 to date including appropriations, claims payments, and Emergency Fund expenditures.
In addition, the NPFC has adjudicated and paid over 8,000 claims filed against the Fund, paid over 4,300 claims totaling $29.5M, and collected over $5M in fees for Certificates of Financial Responsibility.
NEMIS consists of the following business modules and system-wide capabilities: * Case Management Information System (CIMS);
* * * * * * * *
Financial Management (ORACLE Financials -- PA, AR, GL); Claims Processing System (CPS); Certification of Financial Responsibility (COFR); NPFC Intranet/Executive Information System (NEIS); Resource tracking and Management (Personnel/Billets, Physical Assets); Office Automation; Internet/Electronic Commerce; Decision Support.
Each of the NEMIS modules and system-wide capabilities is in a different phase of development.
NEMIS is being developed in coordination with G-CFP and G-S to ensure consistency with the Coast Guard's long-term financial and information system goals.
NEMIS integrates with ORACLE Financials, which has been adopted as the Coast Guard (G-CFP) standard for financial systems management.

DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Coast Guard has a statutory and international treaty responsibility to disseminate important safety information, concerning the state of U.S. waterways to the maritime public
(commercial, military, recreational).
To meet this responsibility, each of the nine nationwide Coast Guard districts issues a weekly printed publication titled Local Notice to Mariners (LNM).
The current process used to compile and disseminate LNMs is predominately manual.
Four separate non-compatible aids to navigation information [legacy] systems share a large percentage of data by manually keying data between systems.
The information is used to create the LNM which provides important safety information to a broad spectrum of mariners.
This information must be accurate.
However, because of the need to re-key information between systems, the information contains errors.
Additionally, costs for printing and mailing continue to rise.
At the same time, the demand for electronic access to LNM data continues to rise.
This project will lead to the automation of the collection of aids to navigation information and the dissemination of the LNM, as well as providing for internal and external on-line access to aids to navigation and navigation safety information.
This process represents a system of data input, data management, and data output of time-sensitive navigation information that can be supported by a computer database architecture.
The Coast Guard has contracted for the phased development of a system that will automate and integrate the capturing of the original input data, provide a means for better data management, and consider organizational restructuring and linkage to other related processes.

DESCRIPTION: The ship's Navigation training and Simulator is used to simulate different shipboard environments from a navigational standpoint.
The simulator produces a controlled environment for the development of ship-handling skills.
This environment would be difficult to re-create with any consistency in the real world.
Additionally, the environment allows for optimal training conditions for personnel using the system.
This increases the efficiency of training efforts.
The system's two primary customers are newly commissioned ensigns and prospective Commanding Officers assigned to afloat units.
These two groups of bridge personnel are critical to the safe manning and navigation of Coast Guard vessels.
This initiative also reduces the cost of training options in real environments in two ways.
First, it eliminates the cost of errors on operational assets and second, it significantly reduces the operating costs of using cutters for training.

MX-300R radios are no longer manufactured.
Replacement is being done on an as needed basis, increasing cost.
This strategy also fails to gain the full advantages available in improved performance and increased protected communications range provided by the new radios.
Further, poor voice quality of existing radios negatively impacts command and control.
With over 3,000 radios in inventory, the Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center (ELC) is not budgeted for a massive replacement of these radios.
As the failure rate increases with the radio's increased age and reduced maintenance supportability, a planned replacement has become more cost effective.
This project has identified a replacement radio and begun procurement of the Motorola Astro Saber 1R ruggedized).
Fielding plans to provide initial procurement replacement radios to those units with the most dire operational needs have been developed.
2,549 single key, and 122(plus 12 for XB) multi-key radios have been purchased to
date and most have been distributed to field units.
These multi-key units have been procured and distributed to Coast Guard Investigative Service units for multi-mission/interoperability capabilities.
Due to expanded missions which require secure voice communications, an additional 1200 single key units will be required to meet operational needs and provide an adequate XB pipeline.
In addition to the 1200 single key units required, deep assurance spares will be needed to replace lost/stolen radios.
The manufacturer plans to discontinued production of this unit in Q2FY01, a additional ten percent deep assurance spare quanity should be procured.
These replacement radios provide vital protected communications during law enforcement boardings and other sensitive operations.
The sensitive nature of communications between deployed boarding or Law Enforcement teams and small boats require this level of protection.
A lack of funding will preclude protected radio communications wherever and whenever needed.
This communications equipment directly supports all Coast Guard law enforcement operations using multiple, mobile teams.
Examples include drug interdiction sweeps of suspect vessels and alien migrant interdiction operations.
A planned, coordinated procurement will optimize capability and minimize costs.
The last order for Astro Saber 1R transceivers must be submitted prior to 30 September 2000.

LUFS is instrumental in automating the Coast Guard's procurement, accounting, and funds management process.
Without LUFS or similar tools, Coast Guard financial management would rely on manual or semi-automated processes of variable integrity.IBUDS/AFTS The Integrated Budget Development System (IBUDS) is a software program that supports the Coast Guard budget process for the Operating Expense appropriation by providing automated support for receiving and processing Resource Change Proposals (RCPs), generating and submitting Coast Guard budget from development of the Congressional Stage budget through the Operational Stage budget, distributes the Congressionally approved budget to the Administrative Target Units(ATUs) and generates spend plans.
The Automated Funds Transfer System (AFTS) is an automated tool used to process funds transfers within the Coast Guard, distributing initial Operating Expense funding to Coast Guard operating elements after the funding process is completed and managing funding transfers that occur during budget execution.
IBUDS was created to combine planning, programming, and budgeting functions into a single automated, streamlined system for managing Coast Guard OE Appropriated Funds of $2.7 billion annually.
IBUDS has automated, simplified, and standardized the entry of ATU budget item requests and decreases the time required for the funds transfer process.
The system eliminates the need for re-keying and reconciliation of funding documents between offices.
It also reduces the need for telecommunications by providing a capability for batch processing of updates to DAFIS.
AFTS was developed to replace the manual preparation and tracking of Financial Transfer Authorizations (FTAs) and Change in Financial Plans (CIFPs).
Additionally, AFTS is used to distribute funding information generated through IBUDS to Coast Guard field units.
IBUDS provides ATU and Headquarters financial managers with a system for administering their funds more effectively and efficiently.
It also provides a historical database for tracking budget information over several years.
IBUDS provides a means to track budget requests for the OE Appropriation within a central database and is accessible through the Coast Guard local area network.
The system will increase the efficiency and accuracy of the process further through improved source data entry (one-time entry which reduces errors), use of one standard form for all funds transfer types, automated distribution of funding documents, use of a standardized numbering system for all funding documents, and through a further enhanced capability for automated research and reconciliation of documents.
AFTS will be enhanced to include the
line
capability to manage other appropriations and will be integrated with the Large Unit Financial System (LUFS) and IBUDS.
IBUDS VER 2.0 presently runs on CGSWII.
When the Coast Guard switches to SWIII.
IBUDS is planned to be converted to VER 3.0.
Funds will be utilized for the conversion which was delivered in August 1997.
The additional recurring funding indicated above is to be used for a system maintenance contract and minor software upgrades.
AFTS utilizes a central Progress database developed by the Coast Guard.
The database is accessible to authorized users across the Coast Guard Headquarters local area network via the Coast Guard Standard Workstation.
AFTS has been converted to SWIII.
IBUDS and AFTS are strategically planned to link both with each other and with LUFS and DAFIS to support the entire Coast Guard financial management system.
In concert, these systems provide a more efficient and accurate means to strategically plan and program Coast Guard resources to meet mission requirements.
In FY98-00 the IBUDS/AFTS "applet" will be enhanced to include the other appropriations.

FIRM The Finance Center IRM System (FIRM) provides the Coast Guard with a consolidated accounting and paying office.
Savings accrue through the consolidation of one central billing office to accomplish accounting and payment transactions for the Coast Guard.
FINCEN systems such as the Payment History System (PHS), Production Control System (PCS), Change Image Processing System (CHIPS), Workflow Imaging Network System(WINS) and Consolidated Billing System (CBS) enable the Coast Guard to electronically process and track field financial transactions and vendor invoices.
CHIPS is a paperless process that electronically receives and processes incoming LUFS batches from the field for input into
DAFIS and routing into the Voucher Examination Module for matching with vendor invoices prior to payment.
The Imaging System will allow multiple users to interactively retrieve, control, and process financial and correlating source data and nearly eliminate the need to manually manipulate paper source documentation.
The Debt Management and Collection System (DMACS) is a commercial off the shelf system that will enable the Finance Center to better manage the Coast Guard's accounts receivable.
The Coast Guard's business processes have been improved through the development of a successful and growing electronic commerce program for electronic invoice billing.
The electronic credit card payment program has been successfully expanded to Federal Highways Administration, Federal Transit Authority and Defense Commissary Agency.
The FINCEN's Rapid Electronic Data Interchange Method System (FREDIM) is capable of handling Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) data and is being upgraded to handle additional vendor invoices.
By streamlining the payment process and eliminating manual intervention through implementation of the Imaging System, the Coast Guard will benefit by resource savings and lower interest penalties.
The system will improve interagency billings, EDI network connectivity and data storage/retrieval.
This will increase internal and external user efficiency while allowing the FINCEN to better serve its customers, achieve efficiencies and reduce overhead.
Coast Guard will realize a minimum annual reduction of $75K in small purchase interest penalties and a minimum of $50K increase annually in discounts and expected to realize a minimum FTE reduction of ten.
The Debt Management and Collection System (DMACS) Project will reengineer the Coast Guard debt management and collection business processes, including the correction of over 30 major accounts receivable deficiencies that currently exist in DAFIS.
It is expected to result in an estimated $1.2M in tangible savings.
Intangible savings to the Coast Guard will be more accurate records, faster and more frequent billing, more timely and accurate data, and numerous customer improvements such as customizable dunning and billing letters.
The primary place of operations is FINCEN.
Coast Guard managers at the Areas, Maintenance and Logistics Commands, Districts, and Headquarters have, or will have, access to the FINCEN's transactional data.
Coast Guard field units provide data to the FINCEN via the Large Unit Financial System (LUFS).
The FINCEN computer systems communicate within the FINCEN over a local area network.
External communications are via the ADTN2000, FAA managed network, X.25 link to the Department of Transportation mainframe in Plano, Texas.
Additionally, the FINCEN operates several local systems on the Unisys , HP and VAX suites of hardware.
FY98 will be the fourth year of the four-year IT project to replace its outdated proprietary systems with powerful, scaleable open system hardware and software.
Currently, the bulk of the hardware and software purchases are completed or are on order.
Migration is expected to be completed during FY98.
FIRM is strategically planned to link with the following IT initiatives: 1.
EC/EDI - a pilot test has been implemented at the FINCEN 2.
LUFS/LUFS NT - LUFS data is transmitted to the FINCEN and processed through the CHIPS system
3.

Apart from the position of the antennas, the system is virtually identical to the HU-25B AIREYE AN/APS-131.
The aircraft installation consists of seven main subassemblies: antennas, antenna switching unit, receiver/transmitter, synchronizer, amplifier, recorder/processor/viewer and control unit.
The antenna unit consists of two pods mounted either side of the aircraft to provide an unobstructed view, each containing a 16 ft (4.88m) horizontally polarized slotted wave-guide array.
In flight the arrays are yaw-stabilized to preserve the radar picture quality.
The remaining equipment is mounted on a pallet inside the aircraft for easy removal.
The synchronizer provides radar timing and control functions and, based on inputs from the aircraft inertial navigation system, creates latitude and longitude lines for display on the radar imagery.
The receiver/transmitter contains the magnetron and low-noise receiver.
The antenna switching unit directs the radiated power to the left or right antenna.
The recorder/processor/viewer contains the components necessary to create the film imagery.
Video data is impressed on the film by applying it to two CRTs as the film is pulled across the CRT faces.
Typically, each CRT generates an image of the earth's surface on one side of the aircraft.
The dry silver film is developed in near real time.
An area of up to 108 nautical miles (200km) on either side of the aircraft can be mapped when
both arrays are in use and one can be selected if mapping of only one side is required.
A range control determines the width of the target area to be mapped and presented on the photo-radar map.
This control has four settings corresponding to 13.5, 27, 54, and 108nm (25, 50, 100, and 200 km) wide scans by each antenna.
When used in conjunction with the antenna switch to select either left, right or both arrays, maps corresponding to four standard scales can be presented on the display at 1:250,000, 1:500,000, 1:1 million and 1:2 million.
Radar and aircraft operational data is annotated on the film.

OA: INITIATIVE ID: FY-2000: FY-2001: USCG USCGO125 $413 $413 TITLE: HU-25B AIREYE REMOTE SENSOR SYSTEM (HU-25B AIREYE)
DESCRIPTION: The HU-25B AIREYE will no longer supported after FY 01.
The Office of Aviation Forces (G-OCA) has determined that all support and upgrades will be directed toward the C-130 SLAR system, which has similar capabilities.
The HU-25B AIREYE incorporates multi-sensor surveillance systems which are specially designed for long range detection, surveillance, real-time processing, and recording of mission data.
These systems are the AN/APS-131 Side-Looking-Airborne-Radar (SLAR) and the RS-18C Infrared/Ultraviolet (IR/UV) line scanner system.
The SLAR system provides real-time surface and terrain mapping with an automatic data annotation system (ADAS) resulting in a geo-referenced map-like display recorded onto translucent dry silver film.
The system radiates a narrow beam RF pulse and receives, amplifies, and detects any target in the returning pulse.
The synchronizer generates the SLAR system's timing, latitude and longitude lines and range marks, ADAS data, and film speed signal.
The AN/APS-131 also incorporates a built-in-test which is generated from the synchronizer.
Operation of the RS-18C IR/UV line scanner consists of receiving, detecting, and converting infrared and ultraviolet energy into electrical energy.
This is accomplished by using a scanner that rotates at a speed of 5,000 rpm (revolutions per minute).
Its effective operating altitude ranges from 500 to 35,000 feet, with optimum coverage 1,090 and 5,000 feet.
The RS-18C interfaces with the digital interface unit (DIU) and sensor computer through the scan converter.
Data is displayed on the multi-purpose display after computer processing and recorded onto a super VHS recorder.
The RS-18C is controlled via the IR/UV control panel which provides the controls and indicators necessary to operate the IR/UV system and monitor the system's status during operation.
Because of the AIREYE system's age, obsolescence, and problems associated with its
supportability, the Coast Guard is in the process of an upgrade.
The original system was fielded in the early 1980's and many of the parts are no longer available.
Additionally, the dry silver film which the SLAR uses for its display and recording of sensor data is now longer being manufactured.

MCX-1000 radios are no longer manufactured and are reaching the end of their serviceable life.
Due to the diminishing supply of spare parts, these radios are becoming increasingly difficult and costly to support.
Federal mandates to transition from 25khz bandwidth to 12.5khz narrow bandwidth channels to optimize spectrum usage also drive the need to replace these radios.
These radios are the primary means of operational short range communications at all units from Small Boats through 378' WHEC cutters and shore units.
This procurement is closely linked with the ongoing MX-300R replacement project.
Poor voice quality of existing radios negatively impacts command and control.
The identified Astro Digital Spectra (MCX-1000 replacement) radio is interoperable with existing handheld and panel mount transceivers.
In addition, the Astro Spectra (MCX-1000 replacement) radio provides improvements in operational range with protected communications and enhanced voice clarity when utilized with the Astro Saber (MX-300R replacement) handheld radios.
This project has identified the Astro Saber 1R as a compatible replacement radio and procurement is ongoing.
Fielding plans have provided replacement radios to those units with critical operational mission requirements.
The Coast Guard Yard has developed installation plans.
These radios provide vital protected communications during law enforcement boardings and other operations.
These communications between deployed boarding or Law Enforcement teams and small boats require this protection.
A lack of funding will preclude protected radio communications wherever and whenever needed.
The scope of this project has been reduced to shipboard radios only.
It is anticipated that this will allow the Coast Guard to support these radios at shore units until they are replaced as part of the National Distress System Modernization.

DESCRIPTION: Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is a configuration of sensors, communication links, personnel, and decision support tools that allow the Coast Guard to monitor ports and disseminate information.
Through the PAWSS project, the Coast Guard has adopted a process to determine if a port should have a federal presence in a VTS to achieve a desired level of safety.
This is a process in which extensive user-Coast Guard consultation determines the appropriate safety measures to be implemented.
The first ports identified through this process for a new VTS installation are New Orleans, LA and Prince William Sound, AK. Additional ports may be identified through dialogue with local representatives for both new installations and retrofit in places that already have a Coast Guard VTS. PAWSS will modernize and expand VTS systems using state-of-the-market components, open architecture, and modular design techniques for ease of insertion of new technology and to accommodate planned future improvements such as the use of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS).
The system shall have a standard core set of functions basic to each port, with add-on modules to meet unique port requirements.
Schedule, cost effectiveness, and configuration management to maintain system cohesion and standards will be emphasized.
Existing VTS systems provide limited centralized control capability and can no longer effectively accommodate changing requirements without major modifications.
The increased size of vessels being managed, increased port congestions, and heightened public sensitivity to the threat of environmental pollution from hazardous materials necessitate an automated, centralized control system.
The Port Needs Study articulated the direct benefits of such a VTS in terms of avoided vessel casualties and consequences such as loss of human life, cargo loss, spill clean up costs, environmental impact and property damage.
VTS will facilitate commerce by providing the selected ports with a safe, technologically advanced, and efficient system for managing commercial vessel traffic.
It will promote environmental protection and safety at sea to reduce pollution, accidents and their associated cost.
PAWSS will lead the way toward the development of a national port and waterway system.
It will enhance and extend the Coast Guard's leadership in a National Waterways Management role.
FY99 and FY00 funds will be used for system installation and testing; site surveys, acquisition and construction; audits, assessments and reviews of the system; hardware and software.

The switched voice replacement initiative will establish a centrally funded and managed acquisition process for replacing the obsolete, uncapitalized base of Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs) Coast Guard-wide.
The SVRP initiative will replace obsolete, insupportable Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs).
PBX systems are essential components of the Coast Guard's telecommunications infrastructure and support ALL mission areas and business processes.
PBXs provide cost-effective voice communications capability to CG units and connections to the Public Switched Telephone Network, including FTS2000.
Strategic investments in the Coast Guard's telecommunications infrastructure for state-of-the-art digital voice/data switching equipment will result in a forward migration to new network technologies such as ISDN and ATM. SVRP will support improved business practices such as management of FTS calling costs.
Voice communication is essential to day-to-day Coast Guard operations, all mission areas and business processes.

At present, high endurance cutters (WHECs) and medium endurance cutters (WMECs) are not adequately equipped to detect, classify, sort or identify potential targets of interest (TOI) from stand-off ranges, especially in lowor no-light conditions.
The most critical mission level sensor gaps as presented in section 9.5.1.2 of the C4I Baseline Architecture, include the following: - The limited ability to detect suspect vessels offshore, particularly in high threat areas related to transit routes and approaches to ports.
- The general lack of stand-off surveillance capabilities from mobile assets, including the ability to sort and classify TOIs at extended ranges, and/or over the horizon.
- The lack of capability to detect small or low profile platforms such as small wooden or
fiberglass vessels particularly at night.
Absence of these capabilities forces our ships to spend a substantial part of each cutter day maneuvering to classify an/or identify each vessel encountered in order to determine the contact's status as a TOI.
The time and fuel wasted during such inefficient maneuvering could better be used in targeting priority TOIs to board at sea.
G-OCC has acknowledged the criticality of this capability shortfall by placing this issue in their Phase I, High Urgency timeline of C4I needed improvements.
The new Surface Search Radar will not provide the mission specific capabilities noted above.

OA: INITIATIVE ID: FY-2000: FY-2001: USCG USCGO167 $2,090 $1,200 TITLE: SUPPLY CENTER COMPUTER REPLACEMENT (SCCR)
DESCRIPTION: THE SCCR PROJECT WAS INITIATED TO ADDRESS THE INFORMATION RESOURCE MGMT NEEDS OF THE COAST GUARD SUPPLY CENTERS AT CURTIS BAY, MD AND BROOKLYN, NY BY REPLACING AGING COMPUTER HARDWARE (PRIME AND BRITTION LEE) AND OUTDATED MGMT INFORMATION SYSTEMS CONSTRUCTED LARGELY IN COBOL.
THE SCCR PROJECT WAS INITIALLY INCLUDED UNDER AN UMBRELLA PROJECT KNOWN AS SYSTEMS TO AUTOMATE AND INTEGRATE LOGISTICS, OR SAIL, AND WAS LATER TRANSITIONED TO G-AFL AS PART OF THE FLEET LOGISTICS SYSTEM (FLS) MAJOR ACQUISITION PROJECT.
IN FY98 THE SCCR PROJECT WAS REMOVED FROM THE FLS ACQUISITION FOR COMPLETION BY THE PROJECT SPONSOR, G-SLS.
DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS PROJECT, COAST GUARD STREAMLINING EFFORTS RESULTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE TWO SUPPLY CENTERS INTO A SINGLE ENGINEERING AND LOGISTICS CENTER (ELC) LOCATED AT THE COAST GUARD YARD IN BALTIMORE, MD. CONSEQUENTLY, THE SYSTEM RESULTING FROM THE SCCR PROJECT, WHEN LINKED WITH THE FLEET LOGISTICS SYSTEM (FLS), WILL SUPPORT THE INFORMATION PROCESSING NEEDS OF THIS ELC, WHICH INCLUDES SUPPLY, MAINTENANCE, AND CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT FOR COAST GUARD CUTTERS AND STANDARD BOATS.
THE SYSTEM RESULTING FROM THE SCCR PROJECT WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE COAST GUARD YARD, THE COAST GUARD'S ONLY SHIP CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR FACILITY, WHICH SERVES AS HOST COMMAND TO THE ELC.

OA: INITIATIVE ID: FY-2000: USCG USCGO168 $0 TITLE: Thirteenth District Microwave Modernization Project
FY-2001: $0
FY-2002: $800
DESCRIPTION: Upgrade the existing Coast Guard owned and operated microwave communications network in Oregon and Washington, consisting of 19 microwave paths with communication signals ranging from telephone, UHF and VHF-FM voice communications used for search and rescue, law enforcement, and vessel traffic service in Puget Sound.
CGDN and National Oceanographic Administration (NOAA) circuits also utilize this system.
The system is currently made up of analog microwave links in the 1.7 to 2 GHz band.
Per the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,and Department of Commerce Spectrum Reallocation Final Report of 1995, the CG must relinquish the 1.7 to 1.8 GHz band by January 2004.
CG will meet this mandate utilizing a hybrid solution of microwave and leased landlines, providing the most capability while remaining cost effective.
This three-year effort provides infrastructure upgrades, equipment purchase and installation, and costs for transitioning from the existing analog microwave to the hybrid microwave/leased landline solution.

OA: INITIATIVE ID: FY-2000: USCG USCGO174 $0 TITLE: Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS)
DESCRIPTION: DGPS has become a critical component of the nation's radionavigation system and greatly enhances the safety of navigation along the coasts, in harbors and rivers.
It has become the exclusive mechanism for setting the majority of the aids to navigation for which the CG is responsible.
It is critical that adequate operations and maintenance funding be provided to ensure continued operation of the DGPS System and the upgrade/refurbishment of the equipment used in this system at the end of its 8-10 year life-cycle.
A recently completed field support analysis indicates that current operating expense funding to MLCP, MLCA, ELC, and C2CEN are not adequate to maintain the system.
In addition, recapitalization funding for some of the equipment was never included in the AFC 42 base.
Without this funding it will not be possible to replace the equipment at the end of its life cycle.
FY02 RP 301 "DGPS Follow-On" would provide adequate maintenance and recapitalization funding.

OA: INITIATIVE ID: FY-2000: USCG USCGO178 $0 TITLE: Surface Search Radar Software Support
FY-2001: $0
FY-2002: $870
DESCRIPTION: The Raytheon SPS-73 Surface Search Radar (SSR) is replacing the SPS-64 SSR.
A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) revealed that the 64 radar had a Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of only 400 hours and was becoming unsupportable.
The SSR radar has an advertised MTBF of 4000 hours.
Unlike the SPS-64 radar, the SSR radar is computer based, with a proprietary operating system owned by Raytheon.
As with all computer-based products, software upgrades and revision will be required to correct bugs and problems found during operation and to enhance performance if required by mission requirements.
These updates will require either sole-source development through Raytheon or open competition, significantly increasing support costs that were not a part of the original hardware-only 64 radar design.
This project provides support funds to continue software upgrades and revisions for the SSR.
