Student Performance and Instructional Delivery B. Gifted and Talented Education C. Special Education D. Bilingual Education/English as a Second Language E. Title I/State Compensatory Education F. Career and Technology Education G. Library Services
B. GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION
Section 29.122 of the Texas Education Code (TEC) states that school districts "shall adopt a process for identifying and serving gifted and talented students in the district and shall establish a program for those students in each grade level."
Section 29.123 requires the State Board of Education (SBOE) to "develop and periodically update a state plan for the education of gifted and talented students" to be used for accountability purposes "to measure the performance of districts in providing services to students identified as gifted and talented."
The SBOE plan, adopted in 1996 and revised in 2000, provides direction for the refinement of existing services and the creation of additional curricular options for gifted and talented (G/T) students.
The Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students establishes three levels of performance measures-acceptable, recognized and exemplary-for five program areas: student assessment, program design, curriculum and instruction, professional development and family-community involvement.
"Acceptable" performance measures are those required by state law or rule.
The "recognized" and "exemplary" measures are provided as "viable targets that local district educators seeking excellence, both for their district and for its students, may strive to attain."
According to LISD G/T staff, the purpose of the district's G/T education program is to address the intellectual, social and emotional needs of G/T students through the collaboration and support of educators, parents and community members.
TEA's Division of Accountability Evaluations is responsible for conducting District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) visits, one purpose of which is to monitor compliance with state and federal requirements for special programs.
The indicators used by on-site monitoring teams are the acceptable performance measures for educating G/T students.
TEA conducted a DEC visit in LISD from November 27 through December 1, 2000.
Of 20 compliance indicators for gifted and talented programs, the DEC team selected 11 for on-site review.
The team found the district to be in compliance with state requirements in 10 of these areas; one indicator was determined to be non-applicable.
TSPR's review of the indicators not included in the DEC visit indicated that the district complies with all of them.
In 2000-01, LISD's share of total student enrollment served in its G/T program was second highest among the peers, slightly lower than the Region 1 average and about the same as the state average.
The percent of teaching staff allocated to G/T programs was highest among the peer districts and higher than both the Region 1 and state averages.
LISD's share of instructional expenditures allocated to G/T was lowest among the peers and lower than Region 1 and the state (Exhibit 2-27).

Between 1997-98 and 2000-01, LISD's budgeted operating expenditures for all programs and expenditures per student enrolled rose by 8.8 percent and 9.3 percent respectively.
During the same period, however, its expenditures for G/T programs fell by 77.7 percent, from $993,392 to $221,252, while enrollment in the program rose by 44.3 percent.
The result was a decrease in expenditures per student enrolled in gifted and talented programs of 84.6 percent, from $765 to $118.
These data are provided in Exhibit 2-28.

FINDING
LISD provides a variety of options for its gifted students.
LISD's first G/T program began in 1988.
According to a February 2001 district self-evaluation instrument for the G/T department, LISD provides stimulating, challenging curricula differentiated in depth, complexity and pacing in order for G/T students to reach their potential.
In addition, the gifted programs promote mastery of high-level concepts and skills in efforts to support sophisticated products and performances from LISD students.
During 2000-01, the program served students in grades K-5 in regular classrooms as well as special G/T classes.
Parents can transfer their children, on a space-available basis, between schools offering either of the two programs.
Credit by exam is also available to students in grades K-11.
Those students in grades 1-8 who earn credit for classes through this examination option may be advanced to the next grade if specific predetermined requirements are met.
High school G/T students exercising the credit by exam option must receive a score equal to or higher than a specific mark on the examination to receive credit for that course.
In grades 6-12, G/T students are served through Pre-Advanced Placement (Pre-AP) and Advanced Placement (AP) classes.
Students in grades 9-12 may enroll concurrently in courses at Texas A
This dual credit program allows high school G/T students to receive college credit for university courses if they earn a grade equal to or higher than a specific grade in the course.
Students may also apply for admittance to either of the district's magnet schools.
LISD offers the dual credit program, Pre-AP and AP classes to all students whether or not they are in the designated G/T program.
COMMENDATION
LISD offers its gifted students a variety of academic program options.
FINDING
LISD operates two magnet schools for the unique instructional needs of gifted high school students, the Vidal M. Trevino (VMT) School of Communications and the Health Science Magnet School.
Opened in 1993, the VMT Magnet School is located in a residential area in downtown Laredo, offering classes in 10 renovated houses.
The VMT program provides artistic training in communications, dance, music, theatre arts and visual arts, with an emphasis on creative development and college preparation.
Students apply for the program and are interviewed by members of the VMT fine arts faculty.
All courses offered use the AP curriculum and all academic faculty have received the training required to teach AP courses as well as 30 hours of state-required special training to teach gifted and talented students.
Students do not have to be identified as G/T to attend VMT Magnet School.
Most students attend VMT on a half-day basis, with a 90-minute period of fine arts and a 90-minute period for language arts, math or social studies; they attend their "parent" campuses for the other half-day.
Although VMT maintains all grades and attendance records, the students' parent schools remain their "schools of record," and all student records are returned to the parent schools at the end of each grading period.
While most VMT students are from LISD, the program accepts a maximum of 30 students from United ISD high schools each time a course is offered.
The district supplies transportation to and from students' parent schools.
At present, VMT has an enrollment of about 800 students.
VMT students and programs have received numerous state and national awards, including first place at the all-state orchestra and band competition for six consecutive years; national recognition in writing competitions; and National Hispanic Merit Scholarships.
Interviews with students and faculty found a high level of commitment to the program.
The Health and Science Magnet School, located on the Martin High School campus, opened in 1999-2000 and now has about 150 students.
Students interested in careers in health and science are offered advanced courses in mathematics, science and health.
The school has a number of fully equipped laboratories, including three computer labs, four science labs, one distance-learning lab and 94 computer workstations with Internet access.
COMMENDATION
LISD provides opportunities for its students to explore communications, fine arts, health and science through innovative programs and advanced curricular offerings.
FINDING
Some LISD staff members who deliver services to gifted students lack the required professional development training.
The Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students requires teachers who provide instruction as a part of a G/T program to have 30 clock hours of staff development training specifically related to the instruction of gifted students.
Administrators and counselors who make decisions about G/T instruction are required to have six hours of related staff development training.
According to the district, 482 of its teachers, counselors and administrators should have G/T training.
Of that number, 436 (90.5 percent) have completed the training (Exhibit 2-29) including 346 of 355 teachers and 90 of 127 administrators and counselors.

In addition to summarizing these requirements, the district's Gifted and Talented Program Handbook: Project Quest outlines the means by which staff can satisfy these requirements and the responsibilities for maintaining staff training records.
Many districts receive G/T training through regional education service centers, local colleges or universities and various conferences and workshops held across the state.
Secondary teachers of Pre-AP/GT and AP/GT classes may also attend an institute provided by the College Board's Advanced Placement Program in lieu of a portion of their required training.
The district's coordinator of Gifted and Talented is also trained to provide some staff development training in G/T education.
LISD contracts with the Region 1 Gifted and Talented Cooperative to provide some required training for district personnel that the G/T coordinator cannot provide.
During September 2001, LISD contracted with the cooperative to provide the 30-hour certification training for 29 teachers and the six-hour training for 14 administrators and counselors during the fall of 2001 and spring of 2002.
The G/T coordinator provided six-hour update training for 165 teachers who preregistered with the G/T office during the fall of 2001.
Each school maintains its own training records and forwards copies annually to the district's G/T coordinator.
Recommendation 15:
Ensure that all LISD Gifted and Talented professional staff members have the required training.
Due to staff turnover and new job assignments, TSPR estimates that 150 LISD teachers will require G/T update training, 50 teachers will require the 30-hour certification training and 20 administrators and counselors will require the administrator/counselor six-hour training each year.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE

July 2003 and Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
Using Region 1's 2001-02 fee of $200 per registrant for the 30-hour training and $100 fee for the six-hour administrator/counselor training, the cost to LISD is estimated at $12,000 ([50 x $200] + [20 x $100]
Based on a $55 daily rate for substitutes for 150 teachers, the cost for in-district training is estimated at $8,250 ($55 x 150).
The total cost for providing the required training related to G/T education is estimated at $20,250.
Recommendation 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 Ensure that all LISD Gifted and Talented professional staff members have the required training.

FINDING
LISD does not have a comprehensive assessment program for its magnet schools that provides feedback on student achievement and program effectiveness.
An effective assessment plan provides information on programs producing the desired learning outcomes.
Without compiling and analyzing student achievement data, the district cannot make informed decisions concerning modifications to existing curriculum and program offerings.
As noted above, students attending the district's two magnet programs, the VMT School of Communications and Fine Arts and the Science and Health Magnet, are considered to be "students of record" at their home or parent schools.
Grades, attendance records and other student information compiled at the magnet schools are forwarded to the parent schools at the end of each grading period.
Information such as SAT, ACT and AP examination results, numbers of graduates and postsecondary institutions attended are maintained by the parent school; neither magnet location makes any attempt to record and compile such data.
Both magnet schools have written goals and objectives, but no procedures for evaluating the extent to which they are being met.
Examples of the schools' goals and objectives are provided in Exhibit 2-30.
Exhibit 2-30 Goals and Objectives LISD Magnet School Programs

A formal approach to assessing student achievement and program effectiveness is essential to improving district quality and productivity.
Effective decisions regarding programming require the collection and use of data measuring the academic success of students to provide feedback to the board, parents and the community.
Assessments also help teachers, principals and central administrators make decisions regarding instructional programs, teaching arrangements and the quality of student learning.
Data currently available in the district for use as indicators of program effectiveness include: * Percent of daily student attendance; * Incidence of discipline referrals and expulsions; * Annual and four-year dropout rates; * SAT, ACT and AP scores; * Number of advanced academic courses taken; * Number of graduates on the Recommended and DAP graduation plans and * Rate of enrollment and completion in postsecondary institutions.
Recommendation 16:
Create an assessment system for the district's magnet school program to measure the academic success of attending students.
