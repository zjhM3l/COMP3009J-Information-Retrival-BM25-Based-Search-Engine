Nature Title Graphic with buttons [ivory2.gif] __________________________________________________________________ Texas Eastern Pineywoods Map Pineywoods Pictoral Region Map The eastern Texas Pineywoods supports more species of woodpeckers than any other region of the state.
Currently, eight species of this unique family of birds exist in the Pineywoods.
The Ivory-billed woodpecker once lived in eastern Texas, bringing the list up to nine.
In general, woodpeckers require older trees and snags (dead trees) for feeding and nesting.
Conservation of our mature forests and urban woodlots will ensure habitat for these important birds, as well as other species of wildlife dependent on their cavities.
