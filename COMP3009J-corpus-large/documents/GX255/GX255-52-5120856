Introduction
Con artists attempt to steal money by selling nonexistent or worthless investments, using misleading information and lies.
They forge documents, make false claims, offer hollow guarantees, provide fake references, and promise high returns.
The bottom line--if a deal sounds too good to be true, it likely is! ____________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________
Successful Fishing!
Successful fishing with spinners depends on three things: bright, flashy colors, bigger than life appearances, and fast movements.
If any one of these attractors works, the fish comes after the lure and is hooked! These same deceptions work all too well for con artists pushing fraudulent investment offers.
Unfortunately, if you bite, the crook makes off with your hard earned money.
____________________________________________________
This pamphlet explains several kinds of investment fraud.
It also lists specific examples of investment deceptions and actual cases where scam artists were prosecuted.
Finally, the pamphlet offers some tips on recognizing a scam and avoiding becoming a victim.
Most investments are legitimate and the majority of registered salespeople are honest.
However, some salespersons are not honest and some "investments" are phony.
Everybody should thoroughly research any "investment opportunity" before writing a check or giving anyone money.

Types of Fraud
Pyramids, Ponzi schemes, fake investments, theft, and forgery are some types of fraud used to steal money from unsuspecting investors.
Con artists use many twists and turns in their pitches, but most schemes fall into one of these categories.
Take note of the general characteristics and sequence of events in the examples.
(toc)
Investment Pyramids
Everyone has heard of "chain letters."
They are the most common kind of pyramid scheme.
Chain letters promise potentially great returns of money.
First, you must send money to people at the top of the chain.
You pay to play the game! Next, you retype the chain letter, adding your name to the bottom of the chain, and mail the letters with your name to other people.
Recruiting new participants is the main characteristic of a pyramid scheme.
Money is received from recruiting new investors, not by selling a real product or useful service.
People who start pyramid schemes are often the only ones who receive money.
____________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________
Small Aircraft
A current scheme circulating is the "airplane" pyramid.
For an initial payment of $1,000 to $3,000 to a "pilot," each participant becomes a "passenger" on an imaginary airplane.
After the first "ride," each participant moves a level closer to becoming a "pilot" and receiving a payoff.
Like most pyramid schemes, few people advance to the payoff.
Most just get taken for a a ride! ____________________________________________________

Ponzi Schemes
Ponzi schemes are a first cousin to the chain letter.
Named for Charles Ponzi who ran a huge investment swindle in the 1920's, Ponzi schemes also use the money of new recruits to pay off earlier investors.
Ponzi schemes rob an army of Peters to pay a handful of Pauls.
Payments to early investors legitimize the scheme by showing recruits the opportunity to receive lots of cash.
Bringing in new investors furthers the investment scam.
People usually receive only one or two payments before recruits can no longer be found fast enough to keep the swindle from collapsing.
Promoters, first in line, simply walk away with the other investors' money.
The Cross and Associates case, a recent Ponzi scheme was prosecuted in Federal Court in Wyoming.
This case involved the purchase and resale of supposedly marketable bank investments.
The investments didn't exist.
Astounding returns of 3% a month for investments of $100,000 to $10 million were promised.
Early investors actually received several interest checks which attracted new investors.
The people behind the scheme were prosecuted for failing to invest the investor's funds as promised.
Instead they used the money for their own purposes.

Ten Ways to Avoid Ponzi Schemes
* Be suspicious of persons promising high returns * Avoid investments not clearly and easily described * Check the promoter's credentials and background * Obtain information about the offering from the Wyoming Secretary of State, from a banker, an accountant, a police officer, or from the local Better Business Bureau * Demand detailed information from the promoter in writing * Verify claims and promises * Ask to visit the promoter's office or tour the plant or site * Back away from plans that offer "deferred" payments * Be alert for signs such as inability to reach them by phone or mail * Be suspicious of anyone who suggests these steps are unnecessary or take too much time ____________________________________________________

Prime Bank Instruments
Some promotions sound great but simply don't exist.
"Prime Bank Instruments," also called Prime Bank Notes, Prime Bank Certificates, and Prime Bank letters of credit don't exist as investments except in scams.
Prime Bank instruments are supposedly high quality bank notes issued by international banks.
Their sellers promise high rates of return.
Investors may receive interest payments but their original investment is seldom returned.
Promoters offer an endless variety of excuses why they can not give investors their money back.
(toc)
Precious Metals
Gold, silver, and other precious metals have always been popular operating areas for con artists and shady dealers.
The private or skeptical nature of many individuals who buy precious metal investments is a benefit to the crooks.
Promoters typically claim that the precious metal they are selling is sure to go up in value due to increased demand, world conflict, or some other economic or political factor.
Purchasers usually receive a receipt as evidence of ownership, but not the metal itself.
Investors never actually see their holdings and will be given many reasons why delivery is not practical.
After the initial buy the salesperson will likely send occasional information or call with "spot news updates" urging investment of more money.
Eventually the con artists close shop and disappear with the money.

Gold Mine
WESCON, a gold mining scam from Las Vegas, Nevada, sold interests in alleged gold bearing ore deposits.
The location of these deposits was in a desert valley outside of Las Vegas.
The promoters in this case purchased mining equipment and moved it to the site.
Investors were invited to tour the mine site.
They saw machines processing piles of supposedly gold bearing ore.
To make the deal more attractive the promoters let the investors increase their investment by paying just 10% down and signing a promissory note.
Investors paid thousands for what amounted to driveway gravel! ____________________________________________________
Gold mine scams are still around! Promoters offer huge profits to be made in mining operations.
One particular scam centers on reprocessing mine tailings.
While money can be made reprocessing tailings, proceed with caution because fortunes are seldom made in this endeavor, regardless of promoter claims.
Other gold schemes involve new, secret, "black box" technology and recovery methods.
Dirt goes into a "black box."
Gold supposedly comes out because a secret formula, allegedly using chemistry investors would not understand, makes the process yield precious metals.
Salespersons claim that using new methods can reap huge profits.
In these cases it's hard to actually know what is fact or fiction.
Protect yourself when buying precious metals.
Don't buy precious metals advertised at prices "below spot."
If gold costs $340 an ounce in the marketplace, why would anyone sell gold for less? Selling "below spot" usually means salespeople will not actually purchase your metals until the price goes down, if they actually purchase them at all.
Do not let anyone hold your precious metal except a reputable bank.
Do not send money by mail to a dealer.
A safer method of payment is delivery of the bullion or coins to your bank paid for by your bank draft.
Your bank should not release the money until the bullion is in its hands or in your safe deposit box.
To protect yourself against counterfeit precious metals, deal only with established companies of good reputation.
Check out secret "black box" technology with the state geologist or an authority on mining technology.

Oil Wells
Oil and gas investment opportunities offer varying degrees of risk to the investor.
Oil and gas drilling and recovery give scam artists many opportunities for fraud.
Promoters frequently claim they use new extraction methods or a new kind of drilling technology to tap previously unrecoverable resources.
Sometimes this is true but it doesn't guarantee you will make money.
Be particularly cautious if you hear any claims emphasizing oil shortages, fears of anticipated OPEC actions, or blockades.
Scams often stress the urgency to act now.
They are very eager to get your money_and keep it too!
A typical bogus sales pitch uses phrases such as "can't miss," "sure thing," or "minimal risks."
The salesperson may also claim a geologist has given the salesperson a tip, that the salesperson has personally invested in the venture, or that the driller has "hit" on every well.
They may also make claims about a tremendous "discovery" in an adjacent field or perhaps that a large oil company is planning to operate in the area.
Asking questions and gathering information is the best way to protect yourself.
Check to verify that the offering is registered with the Secretary of State.
Ask questions about the company.
How long has it been in business? Where is it incorporated? How many wells have they drilled? Get the legal description of the well site and verify who owns or leases that property.
If the drilling sites are nearby, you should go see them.
But beware, some promoters are happy to show you equipment at work which isn't theirs! ____________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________
Oil Rig
In the early 1900's, Wyoming was plagued with a "blizzard of phony oil company stocks."
F. L. Houx, then Wyoming Secretary of State, reported that every town had a stock exchange dealing oil promotions for new untested domes or for promising leases adjacent to producing fields.
The pressures of WW I fed the fever and opened the doors to many oil scams.
Changes in corporate law and the creation of state "blue sky" investor protection laws came out of this period.
____________________________________________________
Make sure what kind of mineral rights your money is purchasing.
Is it a working interest, an overriding royalty, or a limited partnership? Verify with the county clerk that your ownership is actually recorded in the county land records.
(toc)
Penny Stock
Penny stocks are common stocks trading at very low prices and are not listed on a major stock exchange.
They usually trade at $5 a share or less.
The stocks typically represent new companies producing untested products.
In penny stock fraud cases the promoters award themselves millions of stock shares at little or no cost.
These stocks may initially sell for a nickel or dime per share.
The price may be "hyped" or favorably described to investors and be resold within hours for a quarter or more.
Fraudulent penny stock sales people may use pushy, high-pressure tactics to convince investors to buy.
They may even bill you for stock you did not ask them to buy.
This is illegal! If it happens, report it to the Secretary of State.
After the stock has risen to several dollars a share, the "smart money" promoters sell their stock in large quantities and the price plummets because there is no real value to the company assets.
The apparent value is created by rumor and "hot air."
The stock suddenly becomes worthless except as a souvenir or fire starter.
(toc)
High Tech Investments
"High tech" promoters approach investors over the phone, through the mail, or lure people through ads which promise returns of 100 to 1,000 percent.
They claim such high returns are possible because of a revolutionary process or some flimflam technology which they control.
The technology is often cited as being cutting edge offering the opportunity to get into the "next IBM or TCI Cable" on the ground floor.
____________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________
Big Satellite Dish
Satellite Broadcasting Corporation, from Irvine, California, was selling an investment in direct TV to Wyoming citizens by phone.
The promoters claimed they had agreements and support from Direct TVÃ¯Â¿Â½ and were applying to be a member of the National Rural Telcommunications Cooperative, which are real companies who provide satellite television to subscribers using a "dish antenna."
Both claims were false.
Upon investigation, it was discovered that the company did not have an exclusive broadcast area as claimed and the California company could not engage in the business for which it was collecting money.
This scam was shut down by a joint state-federal action.
____________________________________________________
If purchasing a technology dependent on a service area, make sure the licenses or marketing territories actually exist and are owned by the company.
Find out which companies are competing for the same area.
Don't pay thousands to submit an application to the government for a territory only to find out that the license, if it is awarded, cannot be transferred and development of the broadcast system costs millions.
(toc)
Real Estate
Real estate has always been a popular investment.
Buying your own home might be a conservative investment but other real estate investments may be very risky.
Never buy any property without seeing it! The land may be underwater, inaccessible, not zoned for your intended use, or perhaps not even owned by the seller.
Thoroughly research local building laws, zoning ordinances, covenants, or endangered species' habitats.
Insist on title insurance or at least an abstract on the deed.
The property you've bought may be in an ideal location, but if you can't use it for your intended purpose what good is it to you? Be informed, ask questions.
____________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________
Desert Scene
In the past, one promoter advertised parcels of "lush, rolling Wyoming grasslands" to out-of-state investors.
Using photos of foothill lands typical to Wyoming's mountain areas and descriptions of seasonal streams and wildlife including antelope and buffalo, the promoter lured many investors.
The scam became public when one investor came to Wyoming to see the land he had supposedly bought.
His parcel was actually located in the "Red Desert' west of Rawlins, titled to another individual, and encumbered by a mortgage.
This distressed individual's call to the Secretary of State's office started an investigation that put the promoter in jail in 1990 for violating wire and mail fraud statutes.
____________________________________________________

Animal Contracts
"Critter contracts" offer you animals such as ostriches, llamas, rabbits, or even bacteria at a very high price.
Promoters usually offer a pair of breeding animals to start a herd.
Often the investor pays a promoter the money and the promoter performs the actual "ranching" duties.
They claim great profits can be made by selling breeding stock, skins, meat, or some other by-product.
Claims that the animals are rare and hard to purchase or that an emerging market is developing are ploys used to suggest there will be enormous profits.
Be careful! Ask where you can sell the animals, pelts, feathers, or other by-product.
Look in the supermarkets for the meat products or in fashion stores for feathers or leather.
Watch out for excuses that the production facilities are not yet on line.
____________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________
Bacteria in a petri dish
Critter contracts can even involve bacteria! In a bacterial pyramid scam, investors purchased activator cultures and produced essentially dried, clabbered milk.
The dried milk was sent in to the promoters who repackaged it and resold it to new investors.
The initial investors received cash payments from the promoters for their dried milk.
Later investors received nothing.
Like many schemes, most of the investment money stayed in the pockets of the scam artists.
____________________________________________________
Be aware that animals catch diseases and die.
Few people are willing to pay large amounts for an animal so resale opportunities are limited.
(toc)
Theft
Theft involves stealing assets or running up someone else's bills without permission.
Scam artists want your account numbers--not just credit card numbers, but also bank accounts, telephone calling cards, and also your social security number.
In just a few hours or days a thief can charge thousands of dollars to your account.
While you may only be held liable for a few dollars, it can be a financial nightmare straightening up the mess.
Don't give your credit card number over the phone unless you are positive the company is reputable.
Also, do not be casual about throwing away your receipts at the ATM machine.
Those slips may contain your account number.
That could help a thief to get at your money.
(toc)
Forgery
Forgery involves passing off a fake or altered document in place of the genuine article.
Common acts of forgery involve credit cards, checks, or bank drafts.
Check your statements closely.
Contact your bank or credit card company immediately if something isn't right.
Sometimes stock and bond certificates are forged.
Forgers and con artists use forged certificates to secure loans or even make purchases.
If you have any questions or concerns about the legitimacy of a stock or bond certificate, you should contact either a local securities broker or the Secretary of State's office.
(toc)
Tip-offs to Fraud
There are usually three characteristics typical of every fraud or scam: a promise of higher than normal returns, a promise or guarantee that you can't loose money, and pressure to act quickly.
If you sense any of these warning signs, lock up your checkbook! Get more information and really check out the offer before you go any further! There are several other special situations that often turn out to be frauds.
(toc)
Phone Offerings
Be wary of investments offered over the phone by persons you have never met.
Phone scams account for more than $10 billion of investor losses every year.
The salesperson promises a tremendous financial opportunity, a high rate of return, pushes for immediate action, or states there are only a few shares left.
These high pressure sales tactics will hopefully persuade you to send money right now.
Many salespersons also want you to either use a credit card or send a cashier's check or money order via overnight mail.
Numerous tip-offs help reveal phone scams.
Sales calls from someone you don't know, addresses listing "suites" or "boxes," using current world news to sell their idea, claims of "no risk" or "guaranteed" returns, complicated explanations that don't make sense, or asking you to purchase something not seen may indicate fraudulent offers.
(toc)
Group Endorsements
Be extra cautious of investments or products endorsed by groups.
Don't let your guard down just because a club or group you belong to endorses a product.
Many swindlers will attempt to obtain the endorsement of churches, fraternal orders, or other organizations to lend credibility to their sales efforts.
Just because an investment is endorsed by some group does not mean it is legitimate!
(toc)
Television Solicitations
Info-mercials are great entertaining TV skits.
Just remember, these shows are absolutely 100% pure advertisements, only longer than the average commercial.
Their sole purpose is to sell merchandise.
Similar to info-mercials are the 1-800 phone numbers on TV or radio for free investment information.
Many of these are actually reverse boiler room operations; instead of the scam artist calling you, you are calling them.
These salespeople take down names, addresses and phone numbers plus any other financial information they can pry from you.
The information you are calling about may be sent but you can also count on receiving more sales calls too! You are now a bona fide scam prospect! ____________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________
Unsuccessful Fishing!
Don't be lured into fraudulent scams - remember, such offers are designed to look like the real thing! Protect yourself by always holding to realistic expectations, by learning all you can, and by not making snap decisions.
____________________________________________________
Be careful and invest wisely.
Call the Secretary of State at (307) 777-7370 if you have any doubts or questions.
