Appendix C. Model Abstract Model Name: Transportation Sector Model
Model Acronym: TRAN
Description: The Transportation Sector Model incorporates an integrated modular design which is based upon economic, engineering, and demographic relationships that model transportation sector energy consumption at the nine Census Division level of detail.
The Transportation Sector Model comprises the following components: Light Duty Vehicles, Light Duty Fleet Vehicles, Commercial Light Trucks, Freight Transport (truck, rail, and marine), Aircraft, Miscellaneous Transport (military, mass transit, and recreational boats), and Transportation Emissions.
The model provides sales estimates of 2 conventional and 14 alternative-fuel light duty vehicles, and consumption estimates of 12 main fuels.
Purpose of the Model: As a component of the National Energy Modeling System integrated forecasting tool, the transportation model generates mid-term forecasts of transportation sector energy consumption.
The transportation model facilitates policy analysis of energy markets, technological development, environmental issues, and regulatory development as they impact transportation sector energy consumption.
Most Recent Model Update: October, 1999.
Part of Another Model? National Energy Modeling system (NEMS).
Model Interfaces: Receives inputs from the Electricity Market Module, Oil and Gas Market Module, Renewable Fuels Module, and the Macroeconomic Activity Module.

C-2
Light-duty vehicles are classified according to the six EPA size classes for cars and light trucks.
Freight trucks are divided into medium-duty and heavy-duty size classes.
Buses are subdivided into commuter, intercity, and school buses.
The air transport module contains both wide- and narrowbody aircraft.
Rail transportation is composed of freight rail and three modes of personal rail travel: commuter, intercity and transit.
Shipping is divided into domestic and international categories.
Special Feautres: The Transportation Sector Model has been created to allow the user to change various exogenous and endogenous input levels.
The range of policy issues that the transportation model can evaluate are: fuel taxes and subsidies; fuel economy levels by size class; CAFE levels; vehicle pricing policies by size class; demand for vehicle performance within size classes; fleet vehicle sales by technology type; alternative-fuel vehicle sales shares; the Energy Policy Act; Low Emission Vehicle Program; VMT reduction; and greenhouse gas emissions levels.
Modeling Techniques: The modeling techniques employed in the Transportation Sector Model vary by module: econometrics for passenger travel, aviation, and new vehicle market shares; exogenous engineering and judgement for MPG, aircraft efficiency, and various freight characteristics; and structural for light-duty vehicle and aircraft capital stock estimations.

Appendix D. Data Quality and Estimation This appendix presents results of the statistical tests conducted for those componenents of the transportation model which rely on econometric estimations.
These components include: The Fuel Economy Model, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Model, the Vehicle-Miles Traveled Model, and the Air Travel Demand Model.
To date, no data quality studies have been conducted in order to validate the transportation model's input data.
Fuel Economy Model The methodology employed to assess the influence of macroeconomic and time-dependent variables on the mix of size classes and performance was log-linear regression analysis using historical data on car and light truck sales over the 1979-1990 period.
Greater detail is provided in Attachment 1 of Appendix F.
The following equations were used to estimate the CLASS$SHR, class market shares of new vehicle purchases: All Vehicle Classes Except Luxury Cars: DIFF$LN A ln 1

Note: Market shares for Mini and Sub-Compact cars are solved jointly.
The resulting combined market share is allocated between the two classes based on the original 1990 allocation.
Special treatment of these two classes was made necessary by the small sample size in the analysis data sets.

The original equation estimated also included the following variables to capture the effects of refueling infrastructure advances in the future.
These variables although estimated simultaneously with the other variables, were no t included in the AFV model because of the excessive feedback effects of lagged variables which are implicit in the formulation.
Several of the AFV technology coefficients are also statist ically insignificant.
The infrastructure variable was named NUM and referred to the number of AFV's on road of a particular type.

Other changes were made to the original variables estimated from the National Alternative-Fuel Vehicle survey estimates.
The gasoline dummies for 1) gasoline capable vehicles with range greater t han 250 miles, and 2) gasoline capable vehicles were both scaled relative to the gasoline vehicle range within each size class.
Therefore, only the gasoline vehicle received the full dummy value of 1.0 times the coefficient.
The other gaso line capable vehicles received the fraction of the dummy coefficient corresponding to its fract io n of range as a percent of the gasoline vehicle range.
Furthermore, at the first stage of the logit equation, in which gasoline vehicles and diesel vehicles are competed against a sales-weighted average AFV vehicle, the diesel vehicle was not given the gasoline capable dummy, but instead used the gasoline capable greater than 250 miles dummy variable.

Conversely, at the first stage of the logit equation, the gasoline vehicle was provided with the gasoline capable dummy variable, but did not use the gasoline capable greater than 250 miles dummy variable.
All of these adjustments were used to mitigate the penetration of diesel and gasoline vehicles.
A large part of the reason for these changes to the originally estimated coefficients from the National Alternative-Fuel survey equations, result from the inclusion of diesel vehicles, which the survey did not originally include.
Several other technologies included in NEMS, such as direct injection turbo diesels, diesel electric hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles, were not contained as a part o f t he survey.
These technologies pose difficulties for the estimated equations because their vehicle attributes are usually outside of the normal range of values associated with AFV's.

Air Travel Demand Model This report presents the results of a re-estimation of the four equations comprising the Air Travel Demand Model.
This model was originally estimated in 1992, using data from the years following the deregulation of airlines.
With the acquisition additional data, and the revision of major macroeconomic variables, the parameters have been recalculated and are presented, along with the supporting data, on the following pages.
Although various alternative specifications were tested with the updated data sets, three of the four original equations provided results with the highest explanatory power.3 The single equation which has been altered is that representing average travel costs in the "yield" equation: the non-fuel operating cost has been eliminated as an input due to its relatively static nature over the course of time, and its subsequent lack of explanatory significance.
In all of the regressions, the Durbin-Watson statistic indicates that autocorrelation may be present, but efforts to correct for this using a lagged-dependent variable approach have not provided acceptable results.
In conclusion, the suggested model specification represents a simple forecasting tool which is sensitive to aircraft fuel prices and measures of economic activity.
With a periodic updating of data and the re-estimation of these equations, the level of confidence in this approach should increase.

Attachment 1: Fuel Economy Model Demand Models for Vehicle Size Class Mix and Performance by Size Class
INTRODUCTION Estimates of the future mix of vehicle classes sold and the performance level by size class requires a detailed econometric demand model of vehicle choice by size class and vehicle performance within size class.
There are a few publicly available models that forecast vehicle demand by size class, but those models have proved inaccurate in the past, and do not use a class structure that is compatible with the one used in the FEM.
Demand for performance has not been assessed to date in any publicly available study.
Both the size mix and performance levels are difficult to estimate because the car purchase decision is complex and consumer choice depends not only on the macroeconomic conditions but also on the attributes of individual products in the marketplace.
Some of these attributes are based on the styling of the car, its perceived quality, the manufacturer's image and the status conveyed by owning a specific model, and cannot be easily quantified.
Although these variables affect choice of individual models, they can also affect the choice of vehicle sizes or performance levels.
For example, many consumers appeared to willing to buy a Japanese car for its quality and reliability even if it's size was smaller than the size actually desired by consumers.
There have also been changes in consumer performance that may be linked to demographic variables, e.g., older consumers prefer larger cars.
These factors have made the automotive market notoriously difficult to forecast.
The models incorporated in the FEM do not represent an attempt to provide a comprehensive forecast of future shifts in size class mix or performance levels by size class in response to the potentially large range of influencing or causal variables.
Rather, the models attempt to capture the response to broad macroeconomic forces or behavioral (time) trends based on the experience of the last 15 years.
It is recognized that these models are relatively simplistic, and it is anticipated that future versions of the FEM will incorporate more advanced models.

METHODOLOGY
The methodology employed to assess the influence of macroeconomic and time dependent variables on the mix of size classes and performance was by regression analysis of historical data.
EEA has compiled a very large data base on car and light truck sales over the 1979-1990 period.
These data are based on the official CAFE files from EPA, augmented by the addition of vehicle and engine descriptor variables.
All of the vehicles were classified by market class according to the scheme utilized in the FEM.
Vehicle performance levels were measured by the horsepower to weight ratio (HP/WT) that is well correlated to objective measures such as the 0 to 60 mph acceleration time.
Detailed weight data was unavailable for light trucks, and horsepower alone was used as a surrogate for performance.
(Fortunately, truck weight within market class did not change significantly in the 12 year period analyzed).
The models for size class mix and performance utilized the same set of independent variables
Disposable income per capita (in 1990 dollars) Price of gasoline (1990 dollars) Vehicle price average by class Vehicle fuel economy Rate of change of gas price over two years Cost of driving per mile Number of nameplates (models) in a class
The last variable is really a composite of fuel cost/fuel economy and not a new independent variable.
Performance was defined as the average HP/WT ratio by class for cars, and the average HP by class for trucks.
Market share was defined as the sales fraction of the class relative to entire car and light truck market.
This definition was chosen to incorporate the effects of consumers switching from cars to light trucks.
In general, the models were linear regressions of the logarithm of all efficients represented "elasticity" estimates.
However, the market shar utilize the variable (m/1-m) as the independent variable in the regression, elasticity of market share appears to be dependent on how large a share National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
variables, so that the coe model was modified to for two reasons.
First, the of the market a size class E-3
has.
This reflects the fact that at very low market shares, buyers of a particular class are reduced to the diehard consumers who are less likely to switch due to macroeconomic forces, and the market is inelastic.
Second the log(m/1-m) form converts a 0 to 1 variable to one that spans the -infinity to +infinity range.
As a result of this variable change the model cannot be driven to m=1 for any input set, so that no one market class takes over the entire market for any combination of inputs.
Such a variable form has been utilized in prior analysis by Wheaton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA).
RESULTS A stepwise linear regression of performance by market class and of class market share was performed to aid in the selection of independent variables with the greatest statistical significance.
In addition, the co-efficients were required to be
directionally consistent with intuitive expectations consistent in absolute magnitude across market classes that are similar
For the market share regressions, the variables that were statistically significant included: model year (time), price of gasoline, disposable income, number of nameplates (in some classes).
In particular, number of nameplates was significant in those classes where only one or two makes existed in the early 1980's but new makes were introduced in the mid-to-late 1980's; compact vans are a good example of this phenomenon.
Table E-1 shows the results of the regressions of (mi/1-mi) against the variables MDLY (model year), LPGAS (price of gasoline), LYD (per capita disposable income), and LNPLT (number of nameplates).
The following conclusions are appropriate:
Subcompact and minicompact market share benefits from a time trend towards smaller cars.
Market share increases with increasing gasoline prices (1.33 coefficient) but decreases with increasing income.
Sports cars market share appears to be declining with time but is insensitive to price of gasoline or income.
Compact car market share increase with time and increasing price of gasoline, but is insensitive to income trends.

Intermediate car market share is decreasing with time but is largely insensitive to either the price of gasoline or income.
Large car market share decreases with time, but increases with income.
Luxury car market share increases with time, income and the price of gasoline.
Minitruck market share is very sensitive to the price of gasoline, and decreases with increasing gasoline prices and income.
Compact trucks and utilities market share are negatively influenced by time trends and price of gas, but positively by income.
Compact vans have a unique trend relative to all trucks in showing increasing market share with increasing gasoline prices.
It is also positively influenced by increasing income.
Full size trucks (pickup, van and utility) show relatively stable market shares, with a modestly declining time trend.
Only utility vehicles' market share appear to be sensitive to income, while market shares of all full size trucks are insensitive to the price of gasoline.
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report

Some of these trends initially appear to be counterintuitive, but one must consider the impact of a particular variable on sales of the class as well as the total fleet sales.
For example, while sales of luxury cars decreases with increasing gasoline prices, the market share increases since sales of all other cars decline by a greater amount for the same change in the price of gasoline.
Sales of minitrucks and compact pickup and utility vehicles, most of which are used for personal transportation or recreation, are also more strongly affected by increasing price of gasoline, and their market share drops.
On the other hand, standard size vehicles are used more commonly in the light commercial sector or for hauling rather than personal transportation and their market shares are relatively stable in response to gasoline prices.
It should be noted that the co-efficients in Table E-1 are not elasticities as the dependent variable is mi/1-mi, not mi alone.
In general, the values of mi range from 0.05 to 0.20.
The correct "elasticity" co-efficient is the actual co-efficient times 1-mi/2, so that multiplying the co-efficients in Table E-1 by 0.4 ~ 0.475 will provide an estimate of elasticity.
The performance model utilized a similar procedure, but the dependent variable was average HP/WT (or HP for trucks) by class.
The most significant variables were found to be LFC (fuel consumption), personal income (LYD) and price of gas (LPGAS) in most cases.
In some cases, cost per mile (LCPM) provided a better regression when substituted for LFC and LPGAS.
The results of the regression are shown in Table E-2.
In general, the regressions yield the elasticities presented in Table E-3.
The results indicate that virtually all classes respond similarly to the cost of driving, although for small cars (mini-, sub-, and compact cars) an equivalent result was obtained for fuel economy rather than cost per mile.
Performance demand is more sensitive to disposable income, with the large trucks showing very high sensitivity.
This particular finding is suspect and may be due to the fact that significant engine improvements in the late 1980's (which increased rated HP) occurred in the same time frame when incomes were rising.

VALUE OF PERFORMANCE AND FUEL ECONOMY ADJUSTMENT
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-7
The value of performance is defined as the dollar amount that consumers are willing to pay for horsepower.
This value was estimated from the actual list price for the vehicles in the 1988-1990 period and was based on the engine option prices.
This method assumes that the manufacturers are pricing horsepower at levels that consumers are willing to pay.
Most domestic models offer an optional engine with higher HP, while several import models offer optional turbocharged engines or 4-valve engine versions.
In each case the cost of the engine option alone was identified from manufacturer price lists for 1989/1990 models (very often, the engine option is available with other features such as performance tires, aerodynamic devices etc. so that the vehicle price is higher than the cost of the engine option).
Based on the prices of engine options, the following averages are applicable for all cars except sports and luxury cars:
Table E-4.
LDV Performance and Price Options Engine Option 4-Valve vs. 2-Valve V-6 vs.
I-4 V-8 vs. V-6 Turbo vs. Nat Aspirated HP Gain (%) 30 to 35 25 to 30 30 to 35 45 to 60 Price $400 to 500 $300 to 400 $400 to 500 $650 to 850 Price/% HP 13.30 to 16.66 12 to 16 13.30 to 16.66 14.44 to 18.88
Based on these data, an approximate average value of performance is $15 per percent increase in HP.
Most sports and several luxury cars charge prices that are 15 to 25 percent higher than the values quoted above (although some very high priced luxury cars such as Mercedes, Porsche, and BMW charge more than twice the values quoted above).
Accordingly, the value of performance for these classes has been set to $18 per percent increase in HP. Increasing performance also decreases fuel economy and this relationship is derived from a regression analysis of fuel economy data that provides the sensitivity of fuel economy to factors that increase performance.
In general, performance can be increased by four methods:
by increasing the axle ratio by installing a larger engine with the same number of cylinders by installing a larger engine with more cylinders by utilizing 4-valve heads or turbocharging
The first method is suitable only for small changes in performance (less than 10 percent).
The National Energy Modeling System
E-8
T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
second method is useful for changes in the range of 10 to 25 percent.
The use of engines with more cylinders can result in HP gains of 30 to 60 percent (4 cylinder to 6 cylinder, or 6 cylinder to 8 cylinder).
4-valve engines generally provide HP gains of 20 to 25 percent relative to a 2-valve engine of equal displacement, while turbocharging can provide an HP increase of 40 to 45 percent relative to a naturally aspirated engine of equal displacement.
These technologies can be combined with displacement increases or decreases to achieve any desired result.
Based on engineering and regression analysis (see Appendix G, Supplement 1), the fuel economy sensitivity for axles ratio changes is -0.
22 (i.e., a 10 percent axle ratio increase decreases fuel economy by 2.2 percent).
The fuel economy sensitivity for displacement changes without changing the number of cylinders is -0.35 (i.e. a 25 percent change in displacement decreases fuel economy by nine percent, including the effect of increased engine weight).
Substituting a V-6 for a 4-cylinder or a V-8 for a V-8 significantly increases the vehicle weight, and a fifty percent HP increase decreases fuel economy by about 25 percent.
A non-linear equation that captures these effects is given by
Ã»
FE 0.22 Ã»HP 0.56 Ã»HP 2 ;
Ã» Ã»
HP 
0.22 Ã»HP 0.56 Ã»HP 2 ;
where both HP and FE are expressed as percent changes.
The equation is valid for HP values between 0 and 60 percent.

TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS FOR AUTOMOBILES The characteristics of the automotive technologies considered in the LDV module have been developed by Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. of Arlington Virginia, and are tabulated on the following pages in Tables F-6 to F-9.1 Much of this research has been derived from an earlier study of technological change and its potential application to fuel economy improvements.2 In this study, numerous automotive technologies have been evaluated in regard to both their estimated impacts on vehicle performance and their cost-effectiveness from a producer's standpoint.
Individual technologies or groups of technologies have been assigned to one of three "certainty levels", defined below, which indicates the likelihood of their incorporation in the near-term.
The Standard Technology Matrices for cars and light trucks (Tables F-6 and F-7) represent a relatively conservative estimation of technology cost, availability, and impact over the course of the forecast.
The corresponding High Technology Matrices (Tables F-8 and F-9) reflect a more optimistic assessment of the potentials of selected technologies.
In order to permit a ready comparison of technology characteristics, those elements in the High Technology Matrices which differ from their Standard Technology counterparts are shaded.

Table E-5: Level
Certainty Levels of Near-Term Technologies for Improving Fuel Economy Technology Characteristics Technologies currently in production in at least one mass market vehicle worldwide and which have no technical risk in the sense that they are fully demonstrated and are available to all manufacturers through either direct production or licensing.
Level 1 improveme nts are therefore available for production use within one product cycle.
Technologies ready for commercialization and for which there are no engineering constraints (such as emissions control considerations) whic h would inhibit their use in production vehicles.
Technologies assessed at Level 2 are considered to have low technical risk in the sense that some "debugging" effort may be required because of a lack of on-road experience Technologies in advanced stages of development but which may face some te c hnical constraints before they can be used in production vehicles.
Because Level 3 technologies bear some uncertainty as to when they will be fully available for use in production, it is not possible to presently establish with certainty that they are available for incorporation into new vehicles over the course of a complete product cycle.

This section provides a documentation of the updated Fuel Economy Model that also fo r ecasts attributes of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) for incorporation into the NEMS transportation model.
The NEMS model requires a forecast of vehicle attribut es co nsistent with those provided for conventional gasoline powered vehicles.
The existing AFV module considers only three size classes, and requires five attributes by size class, which includes vehicle price and fuel efficiency as well as range, fuel availability and an estimate of emissions relative to gasoline.
In general, fuel availability is specified exogeno usly, while the Fuel Economy Model (FEM) is expected to supply other attributes.
The updated FEM provides attributes for AFVs in up to 12 market classes and five fuel types.
Other than gasoline and diesel powered vehicles, the model considers a variety of alternat ive fuel vehicles that are of both the dedicated and bi-fuel (alternative fuel/gasoline) type.
The fuels considered include methanol, ethanol, electricity, compressed natural gas and liquified petroleum gas for a matrix of 10 alternative fuel vehicle types.
The existing AFV module contains two other AFV types that are engine techno lo gy based classifications (assuming that the 10 described above use piston i.c. engine based technology).
The two others are turbine powered using gasoline or CNG, and fuel cell powered using methanol or pure hydrogen, for an additional four AFV classes.
Available data for the manufacturers suggest that turbine powered vehicles are most unlikely to be produced as they have significantly higher costs and lower fuel economy than i.c. engines of equal power.
Fuel cell powered vehicles using either methanol o r pure hydrogen are unlikely to see commercial production before 2010.
Attributes of all other vehicle types are summarized in this report, and a preliminary estimate of fuel cell vehicle attributes is also provided.
Most of the data provided are drawn from ongoing work by EEA for the DOE's Alternative Fuel Transition Model, or from a recently completed EEA analysis for the Office of Technology Assessment.
The specification of AFV attributes requires a series of supply side issues to be resolved largely based on the judgement of EEA.
Essentially, manufacturers can choose to tradeoff first cost against vehicle range, performance and even emissions.
The choice of such parameters should ideally be made by the demand fo recasting model, but such capabilities are not yet available in demand forecasting models.
The first consideration in forecasting AFV demand is that all fuels are not well suited to all vehicle size classes.
For example, the size and weight of CNG tanks make it a poor choice for small cars.
Based on engineering considerations, EEA has estimated the likely combinations of fuel types and vehicle types that will be available in cars and light trucks.
These combinations are shown in Tables E-10 and E11, respectively.
It should be noted that are no technical barriers to any particular National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-15
combination of fuel t ype and size class, and these favored combinations are based on EEA's judgement about market acceptability and economic barriers facing AFVs in each class.
A second and more important consideration is that vehicle price is a strong function of sales volume.
There are significant fixed costs associated with the design, tooling and cert ification of an AFV model, and if a model has a sales volume of only a few hundred units per year, t he fixed costs allocations to each unit are quite large.
A typical (non-luxury) gasoline car model is produced at annual volumes of 100,000 to 200,000 unit s, while most current AFV model sales are only in the range of a few t ens t o hundreds of units per year.
Since the supply and demand models are not interactive, the pre-specification of vehicle price involves estimating sales volumes.
Other analysis by EEA suggests that economies of scale result in similar percentage price reduction for every order of magnitude increase in production volume.
In this analysis, EEA has assumed that AFV's will be derived from gasoline vehicles and sales volume per model will be in the 2,000 to 3,000 range so that modest economy of scale is achieved, but the full extent is not, for the near term.
Pricing at volumes of 20,000 to 30,000 unit s per year is also considered.
Based on other analysis for DOE, EEA recommends that prices at intermediate volumes be scaled in proportion to the logarithm of sales.
EEA analysis for the DOE indicates that auto-manufacturers must anticipate a sales volume of about 2500 units per year of a given AFV model in order to enter the market.
At much lower sales volumes in the range o f a few t ens of vehicles to a few hundred vehicles per year, automanufacturers have typically subcontracted the work to small conversion shops, or else these AFVs have been aftermarket conversions of existing gasoline vehicles.
In general, manufacturers believe that most aftermarket conversions are not well engineered in terms of emissions, fuel economy, and safety, and often have poor performance at high or low ambient temperatures.
However, these conversions are much cheaper than automanufacturer designed products at the same sales volume, so that an aftermarket conversion is usually sold at 250 units/yr at t he same price as an OEM conversion sold at 2500 units/year.
The poor quality is a deterrent to consumer purchase.

The following sections summarize the changes required to develop each particular AFV type from a gasoline based car, which EEA believes will serve as the base design, since developing a unique "ground up" AFV design is not likely as long as AFV sales volumes per model are less than 10 percent of similar gasoline engine model sales.
Manufactu-rer's may contemplate offering a unique "ground up" design only for EVs, if a specific model can be sold in volumes of 50,000 units per year or more, which appears unlikely to this time.
In addition, only OEM products are considered so that quality issues do not influence purchase considerations.
As a result, future model specific improvements for all AFV types will follow t ho se fo r gasoline vehicles, except for inapplicable technologies for a specific AFV type.
These inapplicable technologies are recognized in the descriptions that follow.
In addition, it should be emphasized that there is a sales volume based price affect, but there is no "learning curve" effect for all engine technologies that are very similar to gasoline engine technologies, namely engines for alcohol fuels, CNG and LPG.
Learning curve effects for EVs and hybrid vehicles are primarily associated with future cost reductions in energy storage media, either batteries or ultracapacitors, and in power electronics.
Learning curves also exist for CNG fuel tanks, but the cost reductions will be less dramatic than for EVs and hybrids.

Each AFV type will require additional or specialized parts that result in variable cost increases, as well as fixed costs associated with: HQJLQHHULQJ WRROLQJ FHUWLILFDWLRQ PDUNHWLQJ
To the extent possible, total incremental AFV fixed costs per model have been identified.
Table E-12 shows how the variable and fixed costs can be translated into a incremental ret ail price equivalent (IRPE) given a certain anticipated sales (or production) volume per model.
These formulas have been used to develop retail price estimates.
Ideally, the NEMS model should assume low sales volume prices, compute the actual sales, and iteratively check if the sales volumes predicted are in line with pricing assumptions.

FLEXIBLE FUEL AND DEDICATED ALCOHOL VEHICLES These vehicles closely resemble the gasoline engine powered vehicle, and t he modifications of a conventional vehicle to be either a flexible fuel vehicle (FFV) or dedicated alcohol fuel vehicle are relatively minor.
At present, all alcohol vehicles are OEM products and no aftermarket conversions are expected.
The most significant modifications are: 8SJUDGH RI WKH IXHO WDQN DQG IXHO OLQHV PDWHULDOV WR EH FRUURVLRQ UHVLVWDQW WR DOFRKRO 1HZ KLJK IORZ IXHO SXPS WKDW FDQ SURYLGH XS WR WZLFH WKH IORZ UDWH RI FRQYHQWLRQDO SXPSV 0RGLILHG IXHO LQMHFWRUV DQG D QHZ IXHOVSDUN FDOLEUDWLRQ IRU DOFRKRO IXHO 0RGLILFDWLRQV WR WKH HYDSRUDWLYH HPLVVLRQ FRQWURO V\VWHP WR KDQGOH DOFRKRO JDVROLQH EOHQGV ))9 RQO\
The FFV also has a unique component, the fuel alcohol sensor that signals the engine electronic control system on the alcohol gasoline blend being used.
The variable cost of all of the above parts is typically about $300 to $500 at low sales volume, with much of the cost associated with the fuel pump and fuel sensor.
The high end of the range of costs is associated with converting a vehicle whose current fuel system requires significant materials changes, whereas the lower end would be for a vehicle whose current fuel system is corrosion resistant to alcohol.
Dedicated alcohol vehicles require similar changes but do not need the fuel sensor.
If the engine is optimized for alcohol, it needs a new high compression ratio cylinder head, which partly offsets the cost of the sensor.
Dedicated alcohol vehicle will have a simpler evaporative emission control system, alt ho ugh co st savings here are expected to be small.
The net variable cost of a dedicated alco ho l vehicle will be only slightly lower than that of an FFV and is estimated at $250 to 350 at low sales volume.
Variable costs (which include supplier fixed costs) are expected to be reduced to half the low volume levels, i.e. $150 to 250, due to reduced per unit supplier costs, if volumes increase to 25,000 units/year.
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-19
Fixed costs for the automanufacturer are estimated at $7 to $8 million per model line, based on input from the manufacturers, for an assumed sales volume of 2500 unit s/year.
However, significantly higher sales volume does not require much higher investment , and it is estimated that 25,000 units/year sales capability would require only an additional $2 million more to expand assembly capacity and enhance the marketing network.
Attributes of flexible fuel and dedicated vehicles are shown in Table E-13, relative to gasoline vehicle attributes.
Prices are shown as if manufactures are pricing these vehicles as a standard pro duct, (which they are clearly not) and EIA may wish to modify the prices to reflect current pricing.
All of the improvements possible for conventional vehicles are applicable to FFV's and dedicated alcohol vehicles.
At present, EEA believes that dedicated vehicles and FFVs operated on alcohol fuel may have small benefits in reactivity adjusted HC emissions (in the range of -10 to -20 percent) relative to an equal technology gasoline vehicle, but other emission benefits are negligible.
In general, the range of prices shown at each sales volume are associated with vehicle size changes, with smaller cars at the low end of the price range, large trucks at the high end of the range, and mid-sized/large cars and compact trucks at the middle of the range.

CNG/LPG VEHICLES CNG/LPG vehicles are the next step in complexity from an alcohol fueled vehicle for conversion from a conventional gasoline vehicle.
The major difference is that the fuel tanks are more complex, heavy and expensive, especially for CNG.
Currently, most CNG and LPG vehicles are aftermarket conversions, but the OEMs have recently entered this market with a range of new products.
Outside of the fuel tanks, engine and fuel conversion costs are quite similar to these for a dedicated

E-20
alcohol fuel vehicle.
These include more expensive fuel lines, new fuel injectors and more expensive fuel injector drivers.
The pump in an alcohol fuel vehicle is replaced by a pressure regulator, which can be a relatively expensive piece of equipment for a CNG vehicle that is certified to a stringent emission standard.
Lo w pressure LPG pressure regulators are less expensive, but some manufacturers are experimenting with liquid LPG injection for optimal emission control.
Engine improvements for both CNG and LPG systems are also similar, requiring revisions to the valve seats, pistons and rings and head gasket.
For dedicated systems, increases to the engine compression ratio (CR) by 0.5 to 1 point for LPG and 1.5 to 2 points for CNG are optimal.
Such increases may, in turn, lead to revisions to the cooling system and air intake system.
The increases in CR lead to a fuel economy benefit of and 4 and 8 percent for LPG and CNG, respectively.
Engine components and costs for a dual fuel system of high quality that is emission certified is estimated at $350 to 450.
Engine improvements for dedicated CNG/LPG engines that are opt imized will increase these costs to $500 to $600.
However, there will be a cost savings of $350 associated with the elimination of the gasoline fuel system and evaporative system, for a net cost of $150 to 250.
The costs are for volumes of 2,500 units/year and could decrease by 50 percent at 25,000 units/year, based on interviews with CNG system manufacturers.
Costs of fuel tanks are significant.
For CNG, the incremental costs of tanks are estimated at $100125 per gasoline equivalent gallon, and a typical tank for cars is about 9 gallons, while one for trucks is 12 gallons.
Hence, CNG tank costs are $900 to 1125 for cars, and $1200 to 1500 for trucks at low volume.
The tanks add about 150 lbs weight fo r cars and 200 lbs for trucks.
LPG tanks cost approximately one-third as much as CNG tanks.
One significant uncertainty is how much the cost of CNG/LPG tanks can decline as a function of volume.
It has been estimated that costs will decline by 33% as sales volume increases from 2500 units/year to 25,000 units/year, but this figure may indicate benefits from "learning" as well.
Engineering and tooling costs for CNG and LPG vehicles are significantly higher than for alcohol fueled vehicles, because of the need to modify the body and chassis to accommodate the tanks, and the need to upgrade suspension tires and brakes to accommodate the increased weight.
In addition, the vehicle will have to be crash test ed due t o t he extensive changes to the fuel system, to verify system integrity.
At low volume it has been estimated that engineering, tooling and certification costs per model for dual fuel vehicle are about $15 millio n. Addit ional engine engineering costs for a dedicated CNG/LPG vehicle are estimated at $3 million.
Expansion of special assembly facilities to accommodate a volume of 25,000 units per year is estimated to cost an additional $5 million for facilities.
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-21
Costs and vehicle attributes for CNG/LPG vehicles are shown in Table E-14.
In addit io n, it is assumed that future CNG/LPG vehicles will be certified as ILEVs for emissions to meet Clean Fleet and California requirements.
As before, the range of costs span the size range of vehicles from small cars to large trucks.
At sales volumes of a few hundred units per year, only aftermarket conversions are expected to be available at approximately the same price is OEM products at a sales volume of 2500 units/year.
Future improvements to CNG/LPG vehicles will not differ from those for gasoline vehicles, with the sole of exception of VVT (Variable Valve Timing).
Pumping losses in CNG/LPG engines are lower because of the air displacement effect of gaseous fuels.
EEA estimates that VVT benefits will be reduced to half its gasoline benefit when used in conjunction with these fuels.
ELECTRIC, FUEL CELL AND HYBRID VEHICLES These vehicles are a significant departure from conventional vehicles in that their drivetrain and fuel system is very different from a gasoline engine and its fuel tank/fuel system.
The pricing analysis of these vehicles reflects the fact that there are no electric vehicles (EVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) in production and that data must be extrapolated from current prototypes and pre-production vehicle models.
Fuel cell powered vehicles are still at least a decade or two away from commercialization.
Electric Vehicles In the electric vehicle, the engine is replaced by an electric motor and controller, while the gasoline tank is replaced by a battery.
EEA analysis for the OTA for an EV with a production volume of 25,000 units/yr revealed a range of attributes that depend on battery technology.
Table E-16 provides the data for four vehicle classes for several different batteries for the year 2005, which is believed to be the earliest point where relatively high EV production volume can be realized.
However, the table assumes that a relatively high technology body would be used.

Not e t hat range is based on an assumed tank size that holds approximately half the gasoline energy equivalent for CNG vehicles and 80 percent of the gasoline energy equivalent for LPG.
Other tank sizes could be incorporated at different costs.
EEA believes that the Lead Acid battery is potentially t he o nly viable near term solution.
Some analysts claim that the Nickel Metal Hydride battery (Ni-MH) can became cost competitive at $200/kwh relative to a lead-acid battery at $125/kwh by the year 2002, but others believe that the NiMH batteries are more likely to cost $400/kwh initially.
A range of 80 to 100 miles is the best that can be considered in the entire time frame to 2015, given the steep increase in costs to obtain a 200 mile range.
Beyond 2005, the Ni-MH battery could be dominant, although it is very speculative to make such a prediction.
Of course, all EVs are zero emission vehicles.
Electric vehicles can be conversions of existing gasoline vehicles, but the conversion is rather extensive.
Essentially, the entire drivetrain must be replaced, necessitating removal of the gasoline engine and transmission.
In addition, the fuel tank must be removed, and the vehicle equipped with batteries.
The EV motor/controllers and batteries have very different characteristics of weight and size relative to the components displaced in a conventional gasoline car, so that the repackaging of these components, especially the battery, requires significant engineering and design effort.
The conversion process typically utilizes a vehicle built without any of the gasoline vehicle's drivetrain and fuel systems, and such vehicles are referred to as gliders.

Energy Efficiency is based on electrical consumption at wall plug.
Price increment is relative to advanced conventional vehicle for the same scenario.
Purpose designed EVs have been displayed by some automanufacturers such as GM and BMW, but most industry analysts doubt that such vehicles will be produced at a production capacity level of less than 100,000 units/year because of the very high investment in the design, tooling and certification for a unique design.
Indeed, GM officials have stated that they can never recover the $260 million invested in the design and engineering for the purpose-built "Impact " EV.
Even at 100,000 units/year, media reports suggest that a purpose built EV would require investments similar to that for a conventional car (about $1 billion per model) but the incremental investment for a glider derived EV would be about one-tenth that amount.
For electric vehicles derived from a glider, investment costs have had to estimated since none of the

manufacturers provided this information.
Approximate estimates from published magazine articles and other anecdo t al information support an estimate of $50 million in engineering, tooling, certification and launch cost for a production capacit y of 2,500 units per year.
This investment increases to $80 million for 25,000 units per year and $100 million for 100,000 units/year, based on the media reports discussed, as well as anecdotal information from the automanufacturers.
However, the major capital expense is the construction of a battery plant, which is not treated here, since the battery is a "variable cost" to the automanufacturer.
In addition, the same battery type or model can be used across different vehicle series and different automanufacturers.
In the near term (certainly to 2000 and perhaps to 2005), EEA believes that the only realistic battery option is the Advanced Lead Acid Battery.
EE A int erviewed the only manufacturer (Horizon) of such a battery that is nearing commercial production, and obtained costs at low volume production (of approximately 5000 vehicle battery packs per year) and at high volume (50,000 per year).
Horizon's estimates for the high volume production rate battery was for a future unspecified date and may invo lve economies of both scale and learning, since such a battery has never been produced before.
The post-2002 estimate assumes emergence of the Nickel Metal Hydride battery, and its attributes have been estimated from current prototype performance.
Although there is considerable uncertainty about its costs, it is assumed that the resulting EV will be cost competitive with a 2010 lead-acid battery powered EV, given a learning cost reduction schedule for the lead-acid battery.
Although it is not necessary to specify the battery under this assumption to derive IRPE, it is necessary to do so to derive the characteristics of the EV in terms of weight, size and performance.
EVs will also benefit from future improvements to weight, drag and rolling resistance.
For the computer model, it is assumed that all EV production will be based on a "glider" derived from a conventional gasoline car.
The weight of the glider with no electrical components is estimated at 54 percent of the weight of the gasoline car.
For an EV with perfo rmance levels equivalent to a gasoline car, battery weight (WBatt) is given by:

Glider
where R is the EV range (in km), SE is the battery specific energy in watt hours per kilogram, and WGLID ER
is glider weight in kg.
An advanced lead acid battery has a specific energy of 40 wh/kg,
while the Nickel Metal Hydride battery has an SE of 72.
These equations are used to estimate battery weight.
The IRPE of the EV at 25,000 units/year is estimated based on the assumption that the cost of the electric motor and electronic controller will offset the cost of t he gasoline engine, fuel system and emission control system while the cost of the battery will be the most significant cost increment to the EV.
In volume production, Lead Acid batteries are expected to cost (the automanufacturer) $125 per kwh or $5 per kg.
The Nickel Metal Hydride battery is initially expected to cost $400 per kwh or $28.80 per kg.
These costs apply in 1998, but Ni-MH batteries in 2002 should decrease to about $250 per kwh.
Costs are expected to go down significantly with experience, but the "learning curve" is difficult to quantify objectively.
Costs are expected to decline by 25 percent per decade based on interviews with battery manufacturers so that, for example, lead-acid batteries will sell for $94 per kwh in 2008.
The IRPE calculation amortizes the $80 million in fixed costs as per the formula in Table E-12.
Costs at low sales vo lumes of 2,500 units/year have been calculated externally, and in general, it has been found that an offset of $10,000 in IRPE provides a reasonable representation of the low volume sales price relative to the calculated high volume sales price.
Fuel-Cell Vehicles In a full cell vehicle, the fuel cell is similar to the EV battery in that it supplies motive power to the motors.
The sizing of the fuel cell is based on the continuous power requirement of the vehicle, but all other factors will be quite similar to those for an EV.
However, the present state of development of fuel cells is in its infancy, and considerable develo pment is required before the fuel cell can be commercialized.
Fuel cell powered vehicles are also zero emission vehicles.
E-26 National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
PEM Fuel cells can use only hydrogen as fuel, and hence, hydrogen must be either carried on board in liquid form in a cryogenic tank, or manufactured on board with a methanol reformer.
The DOE is researching the PEM fuel cell and reformer, and the co st s and weights of these components are based on very aggressive targets set by DOE, not on current costs which are two orders of magnitude above the targets.
The DOE targets may be appropriate for fuel cells in the 2020 time frame.
Calculations by EEA for OTA, based on DOE cost and performance targets, indicate that fuel cell vehicles o f either type will have weights approximately similar to these of conventional gasoline vehicles, so that the FEM utilizes a short-cut approach to fuel cell IRPE determination.
It starts with the finding that weights are similar to derive the required power output of a fuel cell, which is 30 kw per ton of vehicle weight.
Peak output requirements are assumed to be met by a high power lead acid battery with peak power capacity of 2/3 of the fuel cell output, and a specific power capability of 500 w/kg.
Costs are based on these power output estimates and it is assumed that fuel cells will be initially available at the cost of $450 per kw with a methanol reformer costing an additional $200 per kw in 2003.
The costs are one order of magnitude higher than DOE targets but may be representative of prices that can be achieved in the short-term.
The cost of a cryogenic hydrogen tank is estimated at about $3000, with only a weak dependence on size, at a sales volume of 25,000 unit/year.
Costs of batteries are computed using the same methodology used to calculate EV battery costs.
Fixed cost amortization and low volume cost increases are assumed to be identical to those derived for EVs.
However, the learning curve is expected to be very steep so that fuel cell/reformer costs decline 14 percent per year, to reach DOE targets by 2020.
Fuel economy calculations are based on the details developed the OTA report, and are simply weight based for the purposes of the FEM.

Electric Hybrid Vehicles Electric Hybrid Vehicles feature both an engine and an electric motor as part of the drivetrain, but there can be a wide variety of designs that allow for large variations in the relative sizes of the electric motor, i.c. engine, and electric storage capacity.
Hybrids are often classified as series or parallel, and also as charge depleting or charge sustaining.
Even within these fo ur categories, manufacturers disagree about the optimal relative size of the engine versus the electric motor.
Due to these uncertainties, EEA has selected one promising approach which is a series, charge sustaining hybrid, with an engine sized to be able to produce the continuous power requirement of 30 kilowatts per ton of loaded vehicle weight, as an example for determining the IRPE.
Since the calculations to derive hybrid vehicle characteristics are relatively complex, a reduced form based on EEA's work for OTA has been used.
Most of the costs of the vehicles scale in approximate proportion to vehicle weight, so that the gasoline vehicle weight is used as an indicator, and the calculated midsized hybrid vehicle costs and fuel economy are used as a reference point for scaling.
The IRPE of hybrid vehicles are scaled based on an expected midsized vehicle IRPE of $4400 in 2002 under a production rate of 25,000 units/year.
A learning curve reduces these costs at 25 percent per decade, while low volume production at 2,500 units/year imposes an IRPE penalty of $10,000.
Series hybrid vehicles are expected to have 30 percent better composite fuel economy than current conventional gasoline cars.
However, future engine improvements to reduce pumping lo ss and drivetrain improvement s are not applicable to such vehicles, due to the electric drivetrain used.
Emissions of these vehicles are expected to conform to California ULEV regulations, much like CNG vehicle emissions.

FORECASTING METHOD
The NEMS AFV submodule incorporates parameters and coefficients that were estimated by Argonne National Labo ratory in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technologies, and EIA's Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting.
The equation estimations used data from the National Alternative-Fuel Vehicle Survey conducted by Argonne and OTT. 9
The stated preference survey covered 47 o f t he lower 48 states in the U.S. excluding
California.
California was excluded because the University of California at Davis owns the rights to a similar survey for California.
The intention was to combine the two surveys at some future point in time.
The survey utilitzed three stages: 1) initial telephone interview of households, 2) customized questionnaire mailed to households, and 3) a second interview to review the answers to the questionnaire.
The survey was taken from August 1995 to January 1996.
1904 respondents answers

were received in stage 1) and 1149 respondents were contained in stage 2).
Various combinations of vehicle prices, fuel prices, vehicle ranges, maintenance costs, performance levels, luggage spaces, and vehicle sizes were provided for each vehicle type.
Gasoline, alcohol, CNG, LPG, and electric vehicles were contained in the survey.
Additional information about the respo ndent s included demographic data such as household structure, vehicle holdings, housing characteristics, employment and commuting patterns, household income, race, age, gender, and education level.
A multi-nomial logit model was estimated using maximum likelihood econometric techniques.
The sample was divided into three car and three light truck size classes: 1) neighborhood electric vehicles, 2) small car (minicompact, subcompact, and two-seater sizes) and compact cars, 3) midsize and large cars, 4) compact and standard pickup trucks, and standard vans (which are considered work truck), and 5) compact and standard sport utility vehicles.
Each size class has a corresponding equation which attempts to estimate the sale market share for all AFV's within a given size class, resulting in 6 separate equations.
It was apriori assumed that valuation of the explanatory variables would differ by size class.
During the estimation process, variables which were found to be not statistically significantly different from other size classes were combined.
All of the equations were estimated simultaneously.
It is important to note that all o f t he variables included in the estimation are not specific to vehicle size.
Some of the variables such as the dummy variable for gasoline capable vehicles differ by fuel type.
The statistical properties of the estimated equations are listed below.

The original equation estimated also included the following variables to capture the effects of refueling infrastructure advances in the future.
These variables although estimated simultaneously with the other variables, were not included in the AFV mo del because of the excessive feedback E-34 National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
effects of lagged variables which are implicit in the formulation.
Several of the AFV technology coefficients are also statistically insignificant.
The infrastructure variable was named NUM and referred to the number of AFV's on road of a particular type.

Vehicle survey estimates.
The gasoline dummies for 1) gasoline capable vehicles with range greater than 250 miles, and 2) gasoline capable vehicles were bo t h scaled relative to the gasoline vehicle range within each size class.
Therefore, only the gasoline vehicle received the full dummy value of 1.0 times the coefficient.
The o t her gaso line capable vehicles received the fraction of the dummy coefficient corresponding to its fraction of range as a percent o f t he gasoline vehicle range.
Furthermore, at the first stage of the logit equation, in which gasoline vehicles and diesel vehicles are competed against a sales-weighted average AFV vehicle, the diesel vehicle was not given the gasoline capable dummy, but instead used the gasoline capable greater than 250 miles dummy variable.
Conversely, at the first stage of the logit equation, the gasoline vehicle was provided with the gasoline capable dummy variable, but did not use the gasoline capable greater than 250 miles dummy variable.
All of these adjustments were used to mitigate the penetration of diesel and gasoline vehicles.
A large part of the reason for these changes to the originally estimated coefficients from the National Alternative-Fuel survey equations, result from the inclusion of diesel vehicles, which the survey did not originally include.
Several other technologies included in NEMS, such as direct injection turbo diesels, diesel electric hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles, were not co nt ained as a part of the survey.
These technologies pose difficulties for the estimated equations because their vehicle attributes are usually outside of the normal range of values associated with AFV's.
DATABASE LIMITATIONS
There are some limitations which apply to the database and to its usage within a transportation choice model.
They are discussed below.
MACROECONOMIC ISSUES The database model is generally optimistic about the current rate of technological progress and innovation and assumes it will continue to grow progressively faster.
Limitations in the database suggest that these forecasts may be overly optimistic in a macroeconomic sense.
Diversion of Resources -- the diversion of government and private sector resources toward alternative investments is not considered, i.e., large sums could go into infrastruct ure and mass transportation systems that are more efficient than any passenger vehicle alternative.
Governmental and institutional budgets may be reduced National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-36
significantly enough to impede future growth of AFV purchases; this especially applies to the Energy Po licy Act of 1992, which by 1998 has not fulfilled it's mandate for federal fleet AFV purchases.
Institutional Barriers -- the created interests of significant economic or political actors, or groups of actors, could override market considerations for the benefit or detriment of any alternative technology or fuel.
Environmental Barriers -- one or more AFVs may receive significant opposition or backing purely for its environmental impact; moreover, public opinion as well as the environmental movement's preferences may shift in the near future, i.e., the environmental movement currently supports methanol-fueled vehicles, but that could change if a cleaner way to produce hydrogen for hydrogen-burning vehicles was found.
Psychological Barriers -- acceptance by the public is also a function of misperceptions and psychological factors, e.g., CNG, LNG, LPG and hydrogen may be perceived as dangerous to handle and thus avoided even if their safety records are objectively similar to that of gasoline.
Information Barriers -- accurate data do not exist for most of the exotic vehicle-fuel combinations (fuel cells, hybrid electric, etc.).
Also cost and performance estimates for many of the emerging alternatives, especially electric vehicles, differ by a factor of 2-10 from source to source.
In many cases, there is no clear basis for distinguishing among such inconsistencies.

DESCRIPTION OF VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES
The AFV module currently analyzes 13 alternative-fuel technologies against a conventional gasoline powered vehicle11 and diesel vehicle.
Additional conventional and non-conventional technologies can be added to the analysis; however, fo r simplicity, conventional technologies are represented as a single category.
This section of the report describes the characteristics of the alternative-fuel technologies as well as the criteria used in selection of alternative fuel-vehicle types.
Four primary technology selection criteria are employed for this study.
The four crit eria are the following:
Vehicle operates utilizing a non-gasoline fuel or a significantly new engine technology.
Technology holds the potential to penetrate the light-duty vehicle market by the year 2020.
Technology possesses distinct fuel use, performance and/or cost characteristics relative to all other technologies considered.
Data is available on important attributes for the vehicle technology.
Variations within each technology class based on vehicle subclass are not being analyzed as a distinct category but are incorporated into t he co llect ive category for the technology12.
Future work in estimating market share growth for alternative-fuel technology may breakdown technology classes by engine and combustion technology; however, the complexity of such an analysis is unwarranted at the present time.
This study has identified 13 alternative-fuel technologies which have met the four criteria previously stated.
Conventional gasoline technology has been grouped into one single category using average vehicle at t ribut es taken across all conventional vehicles.
Following is a list of the sixteen vehicle technologies incorporated in this study.
The advantages and disadvantages of each of the individual technologies will be briefly described in the following sections.
This study assumes all gasoline powered internal combustion engines under a single technology category even though there is significant variation within gasoline fueled engines.
12 Significant variations exist in the gasoline powered technology such as fuel injected engines versus carbureting engines; however, for simplicity all technologies utilizing a single fuel mix will be categorized together.
11
E-38
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
Gasoline Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles Presently, the vast majority of transportat io n vehicles utilize an internal combustion engine (ICE) which was first patented in 1876 by Nikolaus Otto.
The ICE is a heat driven engine which operates by mixing air and fuel vapor together, compressing the fuel mix in a cylinder, and igniting the fuel mix by means of an electric spark.
The ignited fuel mix pushes a piston which in turn drives the vehicle13.
Since the invention of the internal combustion engine the primary power source has been gasoline, although, many other fuels such as alcohols, natural gas and diesel can be utilized.
It is speculated that if t he discoveries of enormous petroleum deposits in Texas had not occurred during the early development years, the automobile would have developed as an alcohol vehicle rather than gasoline.
One of the primary advantages of conventional ICE vehicles is that economically these vehicles are inexpensive to operate due to the large development and refining infrastructure established for petroleum products.
An abundance of petroleum deposits occur throughout the wo rld and
transportation of petroleum is not difficult in comparison to methanol and natural gas.
The conventional gasoline ICE vehicles are more harmful to the environment t han t he majority of alternative-fuel vehicles.
Environmental concerns is one of the leading incentives for the development of alternative-fuel vehicles due to the problems associated with greenhouse gasses and urban ozone formation problems.
Diesel Vehicles The diesel engine, like the gasoline engine, is an internal combustion engine which is heat driven from the ignition of diesel fuel in the cylinder which in turn drives the pistons.
Unlike the gasoline ICE, a spark plug is not used to ignite the fuel mix but rather the combination of the compression and heat of the cylinder causes ignition of the fuel mix.
Currently, diesel technology is advancing with the direct injection technology, in which a very lean diesel gas mixture is injected into the cylinder yielding approximately a 27% fuel economy improvement.
Diesel technology at present receives an exemption from emissions standards for NOx and particulates.
However, if direct injection engines become popular, it is uncertain if EPA will continue to allow the NOx and particulate exemptions in

National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-39
the future.
Furthermore, EPA is current formulating their Tier II emissions regulations for both NOx and particulates, which may also limit the direct injection technology known for it's high emissions levels for both pollutants.
Ethanol Vehicles Ethanol is a fuel which is current ly being used to supply ethanol powered vehicles in a ratio of approximately 85 percent ethanol to 15 percent gasoline as well as a gasoline supply extender for conventional gasoline powered engines in a ratio of approximately 5 percent ethanol and 95 percent gasoline.
This study is considering only ethanol vehicles (vehicles using the 85/15 percent mix) as a category separate from conventional vehicles.
Two technology categories exist under the ethanol fuel heading.
Ethanol Neat Vehicles use only ethanol fuel, and Ethanol Flex Vehicles have the ability to use any combination of gasoline and ethanol fuels.
Ethanol can be produced from food sources such as corn and sugar cane or from non-food biomass such as trees, grass, waste paper, and cardboard.
Presently, approximately 95 percent of ethanol fuel being produced in the United States comes from corn.
Neat ethanol engines are expected to produce a 30 percent increase in efficiency over conventional gasoline engines; however, ethanol fuel has a lower energy content of only 67 percent of gasoline.
A variation in cost estimates for ethanol fuel production exist depending on the source material and the distillation process.
The EPA estimates that the "gasoline equivalent" ethanol price using corn stock is between $1.47 and $2.07 per gallon14.
Ethanol fuel provides several important environmental benefits over gasoline in both the consumption and production stages.
Ethanol is produced from a renewable energy source such as corn or sugar cane, where as petroleum is a non-renewable energy source which could be depleted in the future.
Ethanol fueled vehicles emit a lower amount of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons than gasoline15.
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that carbon dioxide emissions, the major component of "greenhouse gases", are reduced to zero using ethanol produced from corn or sugar

cane when considering the carbon reabsorption factor of corn during the growing stage16.
Methanol Vehicles Met hano l fuel is similar in some respects to ethanol since it also is used as a gasoline extender in conventional gasoline engines and as a fuel in methanol engines.
Presently methanol is mixed with gasoline in an 85 percent methanol/ 15 percent gasoline (M85) ratio and is consumed in a methanol engine.
Two technologies exist for this analysis under the methanol heading; Methanol Neat which operates on M85 and Met hano l Flex which has the ability to use any combination of M85 and gasoline depending on economic and availability factors.
Currently natural gas is the primary source of methanol although other materials such as coal, biomass and cellulose can be used.
Methanol allows countries with excess natural gas supplies to export fuel without the expense of pipelines and LNG process.
It is estimated that the wholesale price of methanol produced from natural gas is approximately $.40/gallon.
However, because methanol has only about one half of the energy per gallon of gasoline, the cost per gaso line equivalent gallon is estimated at $.7517.
Environmental advantages of methano l fueled vehicles are reductions in ozone formation, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and "greenhouse gas" emissions18.
Ozone formation is a significant problem in urban areas linked to the emission of gasoline vehicles.
Methanol emissions produce a lower photochemical reactivity than gasoline emissio ns; therefore, reducing the urban ozone formation problem.
It is estimated that methanol vehicles emit 80 percent less VOC emissions than gasoline vehicles.
Methanol vehicles emit increased volumes of formaldehyde and methanol gas which can be harmful in concentrated amounts.
Further research is being conducted on the health risks associated with methanol and formaldehyde emissions.

Electric Vehicles Extensive alternative fuel vehicle research is now being done to improve electric vehicle
performance.
The primary obstacle of electric car development is bat t ery technology.
Various automobile manufacturers and research groups are concentrating on improving battery capabilities; however, at the present time battery technology limits electric vehicle range and performance attributes.
For this reason electric vehicle motors have been combined with other conventional and non-conventional technologies in order to enhance vehicle performance.
Technologies combined with electric motors include the int ernal combustion engine and gas turbine engine.
This study will consider two technologies under the electric vehicle heading; electric, and diesel electric hybrid.
Gasoline electric hybrid is contained in the gasoline conventional technologies.
The primary advantage of electric-powered vehicles is that they produce virtually no direct emissions at the point of consumption.
Direct emissions produced by electric vehicles are largely hydrogen emissions released during the battery recharging stage.
Although hydrogen is an explosive emission in high concentration, hydrogen poses no problem to atmospheric air pollution19.
While electric vehicles produce almost no direct emissions there are emissions associat ed wit h the electricity production stage depending on the power so urce of the electricity generation.
Centralized power plants located away from urban centers eliminate urban ozone formation problems and can effectively control emissions associated with fossil fuel consumption.
Electric motors have the advantage over internal combustion engines (ICE) because electric motors do not idle when the motion is stopped as ICEs do thus eliminating the idling power loss which can be significant in urban transportation settings.
Considering present electricity prices, exclusive electric vehicles as an alternative to gasoline vehicles are not as cost effective as ethanol, methanol, and natural gas vehicles.
Even though electricity as a transportation fuel delivers 50 percent more miles per Btu than other fuels, t he current price of electricity makes electric fuel transportation notably more expensive than conventional vehicles20.

Additionally, electric vehicle prices are much higher than conventional vehicles, because of the cost of the batteries, especially given their periodic (every 3 years for lead acid) replacement battery cost.
Nickel metal hydride batteries extend the vehicle range of EV's by about 50%, but at approximately two times the cost of lead acid batteries.
Recently with the advent of the Toyota Prius, EV hybrid engine technology has arrived o n t he Japanese market.
The Prius is scheduled to arrive in the U.S. market in the year 2000, according to Toyota's public annoucements.
EV hybrid technology uses both conventional engine technology to run the vehicle to recharge the battery and operate at a steady state highway condition.
The electric battery is only used during extreme po wer needs such as quick acceleration.
While braking the vehicle, regenerative brakes are used to capture the energy lost during braking.
EV hybrids can run on either gasoline or diesel fuel.
Compressed Natural Gas/Liquid Petroleum Gas Vehicles Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) vehicles are grouped together in t his summary because the engine technology is similar for the two vehicles utilizing different fuel sources.
CNG vehicles have been in use for several decades in the United States while in other parts of the world they have been in operation since the 1930's21.
The largest application of CNG vehicles has been in heavy-duty fleet vehicles because of the bulky natural gas storage tanks.
The CNG/LPG technology consists of a modified internal combustion engine connected to the fuel source in a closed system22.
Because the fuel supply is in a gaseous state the entire storage engine system must be a closed system which eliminates the emissions problem of evaporating fuel during storage and refueling.
The CNG/LPG engine produces higher thermal efficiencies than conventional gasoline engines; however, because of the additional weight involved with the fuel storage tanks the additional energy efficiencies are almost negated23.
However; presently it is reported that natural gas

E-43
vehicle operation is less expensive than conventional gasoline vehicles.
A survey of gas utilities taken by the Gas Research Institute indicated that the CNG price per gallon-equivalent of gasoline is $.85$1.10.
GRI reports that it's analysis indicates that CNG prices including compression costs and fuel taxes are 13 percent lower than gasoline cost for conventional vehicles24.
Compressed natural gas and liquid petroleum gas vehicles are considered clean fuel vehicles because the fuel burns cleaner than conventional gasoline vehicles.
Natural gas vehicles do not emit ozone formation emissions, however, these vehicles do emit a high amount of NOx and methane which is an important contributor to greenhouse gases.
Fuel Cell Vehicles The concept of fuel cells as a power source for transportation vehicles is similar to electric vehicle technology because an electric current powers a motor which drives the vehicle.
The difference is that an electric vehicle runs off of a battery which is recharged periodically while a fuel cell is charged by a separate power source such as methanol or hydrogen.
Fuel cell technology operates directly on hydrogen fuel and must have storage tanks for the hydrogen or have a reformer on board which runs on gasoline or methanol to create the hydrogen on demand.
The first large scale applications of fuel cell technology were the Apollo and Gemini space missions which sparked interest in fuel cell technology in vehicle transportation.
Fuel cell technolo gy has the advantage of higher conversion efficiency from the fuel source into electricity than a combustion engine.
A large portion of the energy derived in a heat driven internal combustion engine is lo st in t he form of external heat which does not occur in the fuel cell technology.
Fuel cell technology remains in the development stage and co st pro ject ions of transportation vehicles are extremely high.
Further research may lower the costs of fuel cell technology; however, fo r no w fuel cell technology seems unrealistic for large scale adoption until 2010.

Many manufacturers have announced plans to have the fuel cell technology in a prototype by 2005 to 2006.

Given mass production lead times of 4 to 6 years, fuel cells may not be available for the public until 2010.
VEHICLE PRICES
This section documents vehicle purchase prices and assumptions used to generate the endogenous calculation of vehicle prices.
Vehicle prices are estimated for sixteen technologies and twelve EPA vehicle sizes, from 1990 through 2020, in thousands of nominal dollars.
The general approach is to establish current and ultimate price premia for AFV's (alternative fuel vehicles) over the price of a gasoline I.C.E. (internal combustion engine) vehicle, and t o use an exponential decay function to simulate economies of scale in production (expressed as a compound percentage decline rate) in order to project each price premium as it approaches its ultimate value.
The shape of the curve implied by the price decay is based on forecasted future price levels based on EEA's judgment where no data are available.
The current Fuel Economy Model (FEM) endogenously calculates vehicle prices, vehicle range, and fuel efficiency for new alternative-fuel vehicles (AFV's).
The equations in FEM which correspond with the endogenous calculations for vehicle prices, vehicle range, and fuel efficiency are contained in Volume I.
The following sections will provide the initial starting points for these vehicle attributes in 1990, as this is the beginning year of the model.
All of the vehicle attributes vary across the 12 EPA size classes and are forecast through the year 2020.
Each forecasted vehicle attribute is entered into the AFV technology equation in the AFV module to determine the sales shares among the technologies.
Because the FEM operates on 14 size classes in which vehicle prices, vehicle range, and fuel efficiency are endogenous calculated, once these three vehicle attributes are estimated, they are then converted to 12 EPA size classes.
All other variables that are included in the AFV submodule are originally calculated based o n t he 12 EPA size classes.
For comparative purposes, all vehicle attributes will be listed by 12 EPA size classes beginning in 1990.

VEHICLE PRICES
FEM vehicle prices are initially based on a salesweighted average by 14 vehicle size classes using auto industry trade sales data.

Although the FEM submodule estimates vehicle prices in $90, the AFV
module converts the units to nominal dollars.
Table E-20.
lists the incremental cost of AFV's above a comparable gasoline vehicle for two production volumes, less than 2,500 units and less than 25,000 units.
All vehicle production volumes between 2,500 and 25,000 units are scaled according to a logistic function.
These incremental AFV vehicle costs are then scaled to each of the 14 FEM size classes and then allocated to 12 EPA size classes.

Vehicle prices are then adjusted to specific learning curves applied to specific costs for each technology.
The subsequent cost reduction learning curves are list below.
All vehicle prices are adjusted each year to reflect increases/decreases in fuel economy due to increases/decreases in performance/horsepower relative to the equipment changes needed to meet a given performance level.
Performance demanded by consumers is a function of fuel prices, income per capita, and the fuel economy of each size class (please see FEM submodule for more details).
FUEL EFFICIENCY
The AFV submodule uses fuel efficiency which is estimated in the FEM submodule (please see the FEM submodule for more details).
AFV fuel efficiency is calculated relative to a comparable gasoline vehicle fuel efficiency for all 12 EPA size classes.
Many of the advanced conventional technologies contained in FEM are also applicable to AFV's.
After conventional technologies are applied to AFV's from conventional vehicles, specific AFV fuel efficiency technologies are used to account for individual AFV technology advances.
These factors relative to gasoline are listed below.
Adjustment factors include horsepower and weight differences.

The FEM submodule also estimates vehicle range endogenously across 12 EPA size classes.

The AFV submodule uses the vehicle ranges supplied by the FEM submodule and then converts them to conform to the following three range variables: vehicle range for dedicated vehicles (dedicated gaseous, dedicated alcohol, electric dedicated, and fuel cell met hanol and hydrogen); a dummy variable for gasoline capable vehicles that have range greater than 250 miles; and a range variable for gasoline capable vehicles that have range in excess of 250 miles.
Range in excess of 250 miles is calculated by subtracting 250 miles from actual range of the gasoline capable vehicle.
FUEL COST OF DRIVING PER MILE
Operating costs are accounted for in the AFV submodule by estimating the fuel cost of driving per mile.
Fuel prices by census division, which come from the supply side NEMS models, are divided by the new car fuel economies for each AFV yielding a cost of driving per mile in units of nominal $/mi.

TOP SPEED
Data for top speed by AFV technology is developed by using the following relationship between top speed and horsepower per vehicle pound.

where: TPSD= top speed in mph.
HPW= vehicle horsepower WGT=vehicle weight in lbs.
Horsepower and weight for each AFV t echnology and EPA size class for cars and light trucks is calculated in the FEM submodule.
Top speed is an important choice variable for consumers because certain AFV technologies such as electric vehicles can only attain a given level of speed.
ACCELERATION FROM 0-30 MPH
Acceleration from 0-30 mph is included in the AFV submodule because technologies such as the electric vehicle can only accelerate at limited speeds.
The acceleration time of 0-30 mph was chosen because the National Alternative-Fuel Survey revealed that consumers mainly care about the speed needed to accelerate from a st anding position onto an entrance ramp of a highway.
Acceleration times in units of seconds was estimated from the following equation:

VEHICLE EMISSIONS
This section describes vehicle emissions from conventional and ATF vehicles over time.
INDEX APPROACH
The general approach uses an index value tied to the impact-weighted emissio ns fro m mid-size gasoline vehicles.
In each year from 1990-2030, the emissions impact from the base-case gasoline vehicle is estimated.
As gasoline vehicle emissions decline (e.g., due to reformulation), the absolute emissions level declines but the index value remains constant (at 1.0).
The emissions impact of the alternative fuels is benchmarked against the abso lute level to create the index value for the alternatives.
If the emissions of an AFV declines faster than that of the gasoline vehicle, the emissions index for that AFV will decline.
If the emissions of an AFV increases or declines less rapidly than that of the gasoline vehicle, the emissions index for that AFV will increase.
The technology choice module can make use of this relative indexing in annually selecting vehicle types.
The weight given to emissions and emissions indexing in the technology choice module is outside the scope of this database.
Whether decisions will ultimately be made with respect to some threshold emissions level is also not considered.
The emissions index is constructed from the following inputs:
Current emissions from a mid-size car for five pollutants (CO, CO2 , NOx, methane, and NMHC) in grams/mile for 16 vehicle types.
See Table E-28.
Minimum possible emissions by 2030 for the same pollutants for the same vehicle types.
See Table E-29.
Annual simple percentage decline in emissions towards the minima, same vehicle types.
E-56
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
Impact-weighting of the five pollutants on health and environmental criteria.
The index constructed from these data is necessary because the impact on human healt h and the environment from a gram of one pollutant is not equivalent to the impact of another pollutant.
This non-equivalence is particularly apparent when one compares the typical emissions of NOx (about 1 gram/mile) to that of CO2 (about 450 grams/mile).
Clearly, CO2 is not 450 times more hazardous to health or the environment than NOx.
Thus, a weighting scheme (i.e., an index) must be constructed to properly compare the overall emissions index.

For ethanol, the 30 to 50% emissions reduction must be weighed against the considerable CO, CO2 and nitrogen compounds produced by growing, fertilizing, harvesting, drying and transporting the crops to produce the fuel.
EPA estimates the pollution created by producing and burning a gallon of ethanol is up to six times as much as producing and burning a gallon of gasoline.
However, aldehydes are not produced (Frank, August 1992, p.106).

E-59
IMPACT WEIGHTING The weighting scheme assumes that all impacts will be in the area of health (85% of the decision) or environment (15%) and will be based on each pollutant's contribution to impacts in those areas.
For example, CO2 has an impact on the environment but little or no impact on health.
For CO, the reverse is true.
Note that we are not considering health impacts derived from environmental impacts as health impacts.
We are using the more conventional understanding that, for example, CO2 is not considered a respiratory hazard (health) but is a greenhouse gas (environment).
In general, the reasoning behind the weightings is as follows:
Carbon Monoxide (CO) -- A moderate health hazard for its role in surface-level ozone creation; its environmental effect is negligible.
Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC) -- Serious health hazard for its significant role in surface-level ozone creation; its environmental effect is negligible.
Methane (Met) -- Important greenhouse gas; negligible health threat.
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) -- Serious health hazard for their role in surface-level ozone creation; also a significant greenhouse gas.
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) -- Statistically insignificant health impact but some greenhouse impact.
The choice of the five pollutants (CO, CO2, NOx, methane, and NMHC) was based partly on the availability of detailed technical literature and partly on SAIC's judgment about the pollutants likely to affect vehicle choice and public policy in the coming decades.
Additional pollutants, notably aldehydes and particulates, could have been added.
The ultimate selection of five pollutants was based on co mputational tractability.
The specific inclusion of methane and non-methane hydrocarbons was based on the need to distinguish natural gas-fueled vehicles based on smog-related and non-smog-related emissions.
The impact of the various pollutants per unit emitted is assumed not to change over time.

Powerplant emissions are not included in the database.
Emissions for the gas turbine engines are generally guesses.
Emissions levels for the fuel cells are approximately zero, except for NOx.
The emissions for converting coal or nat ural gas to methanol or hydrogen for use in the fuel cells are no t included.
Similarly, emissions from ethanol exclude the CO, CO2, and nitrogen compounds emitted during growing, fertilizing, harvesting, drying, and transporting the crops.
Emissions and leakage from tanks (e.g., CNG and hydrogen releases) are also not considered.
DECLINES IN EMISSIONS OVER TIME The simple annual percentage rate at which the vehicle emissions decline is based on an ext ensive review of the literature for both the vehicles and the fuels.
The decay rates are provided in the following table.

In general, the following factors were considered.
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-61
Gasoline -- Development of upgraded on-board computers for more precise spark timing and fuel injection (so gasoline burns more completely and less HC's escape); widespread use of catalytic converters that will eliminate up to 99% of CO and NOx pollution by electronically preheating before a car starts; consequent increase in CO2.
Electric -- Assigned zero emissions in isolation of power so urce, t herefore decay function is also zero.
Even if power source is included there will be dramatic reductions compared to gasoline emissions, depending on fuel burned (natural gas or coal) to generate power.
Improvements in emission controls at the source are expected to keep electricity ahead of gasoline.
Electric Hybrid/Gas Turbine -- Gas turbine would emit insignificant amounts o f pollutants, so they may not need a catalytic converter.
Without including power source, the electric part would have zero emissions (see above paragraph.)
Although not yet engineered as such, turbine technology has been fully developed.
Turbine/CNG -- Widely used in other applications, with well-known emissions.
For passenger vehicle applications this technology will emit insignificant amounts of pollutants and may not need catalytic converters.

REGIONAL DIFFERENCES, ASSUMPTIONS, AND CRITERIA Regional fuel prices are calculated by adding a percentage price differential to the national average retail prices found in the preceding table.
The price differentials for each region shown in Table E-32 are based on factors such as proximity or access to major ports, production fields, refineries, state/regional consumer price index, adequate infrastructure, local producer and government support.
These factors, assumptions and caveats are discussed aft er t he table.
The subsequent notes raise questions about the sustainability of these differences in a national market.

EXPLANATIONS
Gasoline -- In the U.S. national market gasoline prices are essentially the same.
Diesel -- In the U.S. national market diesel prices are essentially the same.
Ethanol -- Mainly produced from corn in Midwest states; the regions that are part of it, or closest to it, enjoy lower prices due to advantages such as access, co nvenient transportation, and local support (i.e., state subsidies, farmers interests).
Methanol -- Mostly imported, therefore regions enjoying proximity and easy access to major ports and processing infrastructure, i.e., Los Angeles and New Orleans, would have a price advantage.
The Pacific region also benefits from California's acute interest in this fuel, i.e., special incentives from the state.
Inflexible infrastructure and the high cost of living in NE and WNC explain higher prices in those regions.
Electricity -- Regions with access to relatively abundant and cheap power produced by hydroelectric and coal-fired power plants benefit, e.g., WNC, WSC, MTN, and ENC.
More expensive power from regions without low-cost fossil fuels drives prices up in NE and MA. CNG -- Proximity to the rich fields in WSC and MTN benefits those regions and ESC, WNC, ENC and PAC.
Competing imports benefit areas near major ports, i.e., PAC, ESC.
The high cost of living and inaccessibility to fields drive prices up in NE. LPG -- Access to competitive imports and refineries benefits PAC, ESC and ENC.
Local production and support would benefit ENC and PAC.
Higher transportation costs, infrastructure inflexibility and higher cost of living puts NE at a disadvantage.
Hydrogen -- Access t o abundant raw materials, i.e., especially low-cost electricity benefits such regions as PAC, ENC, SA, WSC.
Infrastructure and local support also push prices down in PAC. WSC, and MTN.
IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS AND CAVEATS
Regional fuel price differences may persist due to transportation costs from producing or importing regions.
These differences, however, are likely to be no more than $.05/gallon equivalent and are generally less than differences in state excise taxes.
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-65
Differences in state excise taxes within a region can easily exceed differences in transportation costs from region to region.
Electricity is shown at an average price.
Off-peak electricity will cost less and on-peak electricity will cost much more.
If EV sales are induced with the promise of daytime refueling at the office, much higher charges than those shown on the table will apply.
FUEL AVAILABILITY This section documents fuel availability in the database.
The output is fuel availability as a percent of gaso line availability for eight fuels, for nine regions, from 1990 through 2030, through three penetration scenarios (base, high, low).
The general approach is to determine current and ultimate fuel availability as a percentage of gasoline availabilit y (assumed to be 1).
A number of current fuel availability factors were considered in creating a percentage index fo r each fuel.
Projected availability is determined by changes in these factors over time, which are represented by an exponential rate of closure in the current availability gap between gasoline and each of seven alternative fuels.
The rate of closure changes for each of three penetration scenarios (base, high, low).
The data reported in this section are uncertain and of questionable usefulness due to the uncertain specification of availability in the model.
The values reported in this section must be read in the light of the subsequent extended comments on modeling problems related to fuel availability.
The inputs used to forecast fuel availability are:
Current regional fuel availability factors, as a percentage of gasoline availability, for all fuels.
Fuel availability growth factors, represented as an exponential rate of closure in the availability gap.
The approach has the following advantages:
E-66
Projected alternative fuel availability index values should be relatively consistent vis a vis gasoline and other ATF availability indices.
Updating and revising figures based on future developments are facilitated.
National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
CURRENT FUEL AVAILABILITY Current alternative fuel availability regional differences are expressed as a percentage of gaso line availability in the base year 1990 as shown in the following table.
Important limit at ions on these values and their usage are subsequently discussed.
Table E-33.
Base Year (1990) Fuel Availability, by Region FUEL TYPE GASOLINE 
FUTURE AVAILABILITY Changes in infrastructure and other growth factors that are demanded by an economically significant ATF are discussed in this section, along with pertinent assumptions and caveats.
Future availability is determined by changes in the regional availability factors outlined in the previous section.
Such changes affect the differences between gasoline and each ATF, so they are represented by an exponential rate of closure of the availability gap between gasoline and each ATF.
GASOLINE INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER GROW TH FACTORS There are roughly a million gasoline stations in the United States at the present time.
For any ATF to be accepted by the public a certain threshold of availability must be reached (aside from economic and other considerations).
At t aining the threshold level would require government and private investments in infrastructure in the order of tens of billions of dollars in a very short time.
It would also exclude the possibility of having more than one or two competitive different fuels at one time.
The infrastructure required would vary considerably from fuel to fuel.
The implications are explored National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
E-67
for each fuel below.
Ethanol and methanol -- a large proportion of the existing equipment could be easily adapted as these two fuels have obvious physical similarities to gasoline, i.e., use same pumps and dispensing equipment .
However in the case of methanol, its corrosive nature would demand upgrading the system's reservoirs and pipes.
There are additional expenses associated with differences in water tolerance and fuel contamination, fire, and explosion hazards.
CNG and LPG -- there is a small infrastructure capable of handling vehicle fleets successfully.
Both fuels are, and will continue to be, attractive fo r t he vehicle fleet subset, because a central refueling site can service the entire fleet.
However, for private passenger cars, adapting a single existing gasoline service station would require a minimum of $250,000 for a compressor.
Such a price tag would rule out a wide distribution network for passenger vehicles unless there is some government subsidy.
Electricity -- the extensive existing electricity infrastructure sho uld be capable of servicing a large number of vehicles in terms of megawatts of off-peak capacity.
Onpeak demand would cause massive cost and availability problems.
Moreover, since long refueling time would make service station refueling impossible, costly adapters would have to find a place in every user's household.
Hydrogen -- although there is an almost limitless supply of raw materials (e.g., water), there is no existing infrastructure for the distribution of hydrogen.
Hydrogen's low mass makes it expensive to store since it must be liquified or bound to other substances.
For these reasons reaching the necessary threshold level would involve a much higher price tag than for other ATFs.
EXPONENTIAL RATE OF CLOSURE The growth factors described above were used to determine the exponential rate of clo sure in the availability gap between gasoline and each ATF, for each penetration scenario.
Assumptio ns and caveats in addition to the ones outlined above are provided after the table.

ASSUMPTIONS AND CAVEATS
Accelerated exponential rates in all penetration cases, especially in the high case, such that a common market would appear in the United States within ten to twenty years.
The market arrival time span for each fuel was calculated based on each fuel individually without any other ATF challenger.
Such a individual co mpetition approach is inconsistent with the model specifications.
Regional differences in availabilit y are highly unlikely in any national market, though they can exist initially.
Even though regional fuel price differences may persist due to transportation costs from producing or importing regions, availability differences cannot, and will not persist if a national market develops.
It is not clear what constitutes availability for EV's, i.e., whether refueling time refers to recharging batteries as opposed to switching them.
Therefore arbitrary assumptions have been made for this category.

Attachment 3: LDV Stock Module Fuel Economy Gap Estimation
INTRODUCTION This attachment presents long-term projections of the fuel efficiency degradation factor for automobiles and light-duty trucks.
The projections are based on the analysis of important trends in driving patterns that affect fuel economy.
These trends include the increase in urban share driving, urban congestion, and highway speeds.
The projections are developed for the period 1990 through 2020.
This appendix also outlines other efforts to project fuel economy degradation factors.30
BACKGROUND A discrepancy exists between automotive fuel economy as measured by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under controlled laboratory conditions and the actual fuel efficiency observed under real "on road" conditions.
Public and private organizations such as the Department of Energy (DOE), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, and Mitsubitshi Motors Corporation have conducted independent research on fuel economy, in the past, confirming this discrepancy.31 The fuel efficiency degradation factor (also known as "the gap") measures this discrepancy and is defined as the difference between on-road fuel economy and EPA tested fuel economy.32 When fuel econo my is expressed in terms of miles per gallons (MPG), the degradation factor or gap is formulated as:
*$3 (3$ 7HVW 03* 2Q5RDG 03* (3$ 7HVW 03* This appendix is taken from a report which was prepared by Deci s i on Anal ysis Corporation of Virginia (DAC) for the Energy Demand Analysis Branch of the Energy Information Administration (EIA), under Task No. 92010, Subtask 1, Contract No.

National Energy Modeling System T ransportation Model Demand Sector Documentation Report
On-road fuel efficiency depends on several determinants which can be classified into technological factors, driver behavior and habits, driving trends, and road and climate conditions.
Furthermore, the magnitude of the gap between tested fuel efficiency and on-road fuel efficiency depends on the specific procedures and conditions used during the test and the closeness of the formulations used to represent real driving conditions.
EPA fuel economy estimates for city and highway driving are published every year for each new model available in the U.S.33 These MPG estimates are obtained based on vehicle tests performed under controlled laboratory conditions and then adjusted downwards to reflect actual driving conditions.
Separate tests are used to generate the city and highway MPG estimates.
The EPA city fuel economy estimates are based on a test that simulates a 7.5 mile, stop-and-go trip with an average speed of 20 mph.
The trip lasts 23 minutes and has 18 stops.
About 18 percent of the time is spent idling, such as waiting for traffic lights or in rush hour traffic.
Two types of engine starts are used: a cold start and a hot start.
The cold start is similar to starting the car in the morning aft er it has been parked all night.
The hot start is similar to restarting a vehicle after it has been warmed up, driven and stopped for a short time.
The EPA highway fuel economy estimates represent a mixture of "no n-cit y" driving.
Segments corresponding to different kinds of rural roads and int erstate highways are included.
The test simulates a 10-mile trip and averages 48 mph.
The test is run from hot start and has little idling time and no stops.
EPA adjusts these laboratory fuel economy estimates downwards to reflect actual driving on the road conditions.
In the 1992 Gas Mileage Guide: EPA Fuel Economy Estimates the city estimates are lowered by 10 percent and t he highway estimates by 22 percent from the laboratory test results.
These adjustment factors represent the EPA est imates of the fuel efficiency gap for both city and highway driving.
Fuel economy can also be represented by a composite number that combines city and highway fuel economies.
EPA computes composite fuel economies using the following formulation:

where: MPGc = Miles per gallon for city driving MPGh = Miles per gallon for highway driving
EPA's composite formulation is developed based on 55% city driving and 45% highway driving.
This formulation, combined with the EPA city and highway fuel efficiency gaps, leads to a base composite MPG gap for all new vehicles of 15 percent.
Previous attempts at estimating the base fuel efficiency gap have been made.
In 1978, McNutt et al., measured the gap for model year 1974 through model year 1977 cars.
The resulting estimates of the gap were between 6 and 9 percent.
34 In 1984, Hellman and Murrel estimated a composite MPG gap of 15 percent.35 More recently in 1992, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) reported composite gap estimates that apply to all automobiles and light trucks in operation.36 The ORNL base composite gap estimate for all automobiles in operation pre-1974 to 1989 was 15.2 percent.
The ORNL gap estimate for light trucks in operation pre-1976 to 1989 was 28.3 percent.
For this analysis, ORNL used EPA tested fuel economy data which was verified by t he National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA).
These data were compared against on-road fuel economy data from (1) the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Statistics 1989, (2) the Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, 1988 Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey (RTECS), and (3) the Bureau of the Census, 1987 Census of Transportation, Truck Inventory and Use Survey (TIUS).
Very few attempts to forecast trends in the fuel economy gap are available.
In 1989, Westbrook and Patterson analyzed trends in driving patterns and produced forecasts of the fuel economy gap for the year 2010.37 Their results indicated a composite gap of 29.7 percent for automobiles for the year 2010.
This combined fuel efficient gap corresponded to a city fuel efficiency gap of 23.5 percent and a highway fuel efficiency gap of 30.5 percent.
Organizations such as Data Resources Incorporated (DRI) and Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates (WEFA) use values for the degradation factors that remain constant over their forecasting horizon.

the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in the 1990 National Energy Strategy (NES) projected the fuel efficiency gap to reach 30 percent by 2030 in the NES reference case.38 The projected gap for the High Conservation and the Very High Conservation cases of NES were 25 and 20 percent respectively.
Also, EIA in the Annual Energy Outlook 1992 (AEO) projected the fuel efficiency gap to increase from 20 percent in 1990 to 25 percent in 2010.
An ongoing effort by DOE's of Tennessee is focused on through 2010.
This work shares, highway speed, and Office of Transportation Technologies in conjunction with the University forecasting the fuel efficiency gap for automobiles and light duty trucks considers three scenarios based on differing assumptions about urban congestion trends.
This attachment presents independent projections of the fuel efficiency gap to the year 2020 for two vehicle types: 1) 2) Automobiles, and Light Duty Trucks
The projections are generated based on the analysis of three important trends in driving patterns that affect fuel efficiency.
These factors are: 1) 2) 3) increasing urban share of vehicle miles traveled, increasing average highway speed, and increasing level of urban highway congestion.
Logistic Approach The historical urban share of automobile VMT driving from 1972 through 1997 was estimated with a logistic curve fitted to the historical period and extended through the year 2020.
The logistic share values are developed based on a logistic functional form originally formulated by Fisher and Pry 39 and defined by:
