Should I Take Part in a Prevention Trial? (Section 8 of 9)
* Weighing the Pros and Cons * Questions You Should Ask
Table of Contents for Booklet
People decide to be part of a cancer prevention clinical trial for many reasons.
For example: * Some people who have a higher cancer risk join a cancer prevention trial because they want to take a more active role in their health care.
Also, because study participants get regular and careful medical attention, some health problems may be found early.
* Some people feel good about helping medical knowledge advance.
If the study agent turns out to work against cancer, it may help others.
For example, prevention trials showed that aspirin helps prevent heart attacks, and now many people take aspirin daily on their doctor's advice.

Even when they don't lead to new therapies, clinical trials often answer important questions and help move research forward.
You need to weigh the benefits and risks for yourself.
The list in the next section may help you do that.
You also may find it useful to talk with family members or friends, your health care providers, and anyone you know who has been in a clinical trial.
Remember: You are the only person who can make this decision, and if you join a clinical trial, you can change your mind at any time - even after the study starts.

Weighing the Pros and Cons
Possible Benefits * If the agent being studied is found to be helpful, you may be among the first to benefit.
* In a cancer prevention clinical trial, your health is reviewed with care.
* A cancer prevention clinical trial gives you a chance to help doctors learn more about cancer prevention and help others.
Possible Drawbacks * New agents may have side effects or risks unknown to the doctors.
* The side effects, and results, of the agent may be worse than what's now recommended.
* Even if a new agent is helpful, it may not work for you.
* Health insurance and managed care providers don't always cover all costs in a clinical trial.
(To find out what costs are likely to be covered for you, talk to a member of the research team or a social worker.)

Questions You Should Ask
Finding answers, and making choices, may be hard for people who are at risk for cancer - and for those who care about them.
It's important for you to discuss your concerns and your choices with your doctor and with the staff of any clinical study that you're thinking of joining.
Ask questions about any issues that concern you.
You need to review your choices.
Tips for Getting Information
When you talk with your doctor or members of the research team: * Take a family member or friend along for support and for help in asking questions or recording answers.
* Plan ahead what to ask--but don't be afraid to ask any new questions you think of while you're there.
* Write down your questions in advance, to make sure you remember to ask them all.
* Write down the answers someplace where you can review them when you want.
* Bring a tape recorder to make a record of what's said (even if you write down answers).
