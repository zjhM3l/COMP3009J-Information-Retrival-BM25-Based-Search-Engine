86-193 EPW Major Decisions in the House and Senate Chambers on Social Security: 19354985 CRS ABSTRACT This paper reviews the major voting decisions taken by the House and the Senate in passing the original Social Security Act and in amending it from 1936 through 1985.
Discussion centers on Old-Age, Survivors and Disability
Insurance (OASDI) votes, although votes on Medicare and other programs are brought up occasionally.
This paper attempts to give the reader the tone and
context of House and Senate debate on individual social security issues.

PREFACE During the period since the enactment of the Social Security Act, Many, perhaps most, of the
there have been hundreds of amendments to the Act.
amendments have been to the Social Security program itself, which encompasses just one title of the Act.
Consequently, this paper could not possibly be comprehensive) nor does it try to be. sions on individual major amendments.
Instead, it briefly summarizes discus These summations clearly do not capture
the range of motivations behind social security votes; rather they record the arguments expressed at the time and, by so doing, attempt to give the reader the tone and context of the debate on major social security issues brought before the House and Senate chambers.
The impetus for this report comes from the many inquiries that CRS gets for social security vote information, which range from requests for general information about legislative action over the years to requests for information about specific floor amendments.
The paper is thus intended to be a reference
document on the major statutory decisions taken by Congress on the Social Security program.
A detailed table of contents and a summary table of the
legislation discussed are provided to aid the reader.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This report was strengthened by the expertise of David Koitz, a specialist who has provided Congress with analyses of many of the social security provi sions discussed, Geoffrey Kollmann, and Vee Burke, all of the Education and Public Welfare Division of the Congressional Research Service (CRS).
Gene Falk, also of the Education and Public Welfare Division, provided major assis tance in checking information and citations.
In addition, I would like to
thank the Office of Legislative and Regulatory Policy of the Social Security Administration for providing very thorough and detailed comments on and sug gestions for the paper.

MAJOR DECISIONS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE CHAMBERS ON SOCIAL SECURITY: 1935-1985 I. INTRODUCTION The Social Security Act of 1935 established a Federal old-age pension, financed with employee-employer payroll taxes, for most workers in commerce and industry.
times.
Amendments to the original Act have: added survivors' and dependents' benefits; added disability, hospital, and medical insurance; expanded coverage to new groups of workers; lowered the minimum age for retirement benefits; in- creased payroll taxes; raised benefits; provided for automatic adjustment of benefits to reflect inflation; and made numerous other changes.
This paper reviews the major votes taken by the House and Senate in passing the original Act and in amending it from 1936 through 1985.
Discussion centers on Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) votes, although Medicare and other programs are brought up occasionally.
The discussion of the votes is Congress since then has changed the social security program many
set forth in terms of House action, Senate action, and conference agreements, and it gives the party breakdown for most votes discussed (D Republican, I Independent).

From the start the old-age benefits program aroused argument.
Opponents said that the payroll or social security tax was likely to overburden industry, reduce the purchasing power of workers, and endanger the growth of private pen sion plans.
In addition, some argued that huge reserves to be built up in the a tempting source of funds that the Gov

ernment could borrow for current spending and, thus, would lead to an increase in the Federal debt.
Fear that the reserve account would be used to subsidize
"New Deal" projects was one reason why some members argued for current financing (pay-as-you-go) of old-age benefits.
Some opponents maintained that the Federal
Government did not have the constitutional power to create a national pension plan.
Some questioned whether the system could be kept financially sound and
whether adequate earnings records could be maintained for so many millions of workers.
Still others criticized the program as not generous enough.
They
protested that it gave only partial protection and minimal benefits, and that it imposed a regressive, "soak-the-poor" tax.
Proponents maintained that social security would provide protection against destitution and dependency in old age and that it would provide persons with an opportunity to care for themselves in old age on a more adequate basis than could be obtained from State old-age assistance payments (welfare).
Some
garded the proposal's self-financing method--payroll taxes on employer and em ployees-- as a strength.
Since workers would be required to pay taxes on their
wages in order to receive social security, they would acquire an earned right to benefits, and no income test would apply.
Further, some said that because
the system would be financed by earmarked payroll taxes, it would be relatively free from political and economic pressures that might impair its financial soundness and capacity to do the job intended.

CHAMBER VOTES P.L. 271--74th Congress, Enactment of the Social Security Act (H.R. 7260) The Social Security Act became law on August 14, 1935, when President
Roosevelt signed H.R. 7260.
Title II of the Act created a compulsory national
old-age benefits program, covering nearly all workers in commerce and industry and providing monthly pensions at age 65 for insured workers.
A benefit
weighted toward lower-income workers was to be based on cumulative wages and was to be payable beginning in 1942 to persons aged 65 and over who had paid social security taxes for at least five years.
The benefit was to be withheld
from an otherwise qualified person in any month in which he or she worked during any part of the month.
Under title VIII of the Act, a payroll tax of one percent each on employees and employers , payable on earnings up to $3,000 each year, was to be imposed as of January 1, 1937, on covered jobs, and was scheduled to rise in steps to three percent by 1949.
Besides old-age benefits, the Act provided for a system of Federal-State unemployment compensation funded with employer payroll taxes, and for grants to States to help fund assistance payments to certain categories of needy persons (the aged, the blind, and children under 16 who had been deprived of parental support), child welfare services, and maternal and child health services.
When the Act was debated in Congress, leading Republicans in the House and Senate made attempts to delete the provisions creating the old-age pension system.
They said they preferred to rely solely on the assistance (charity/ They argued that the payroll tax/insurance
welfare) approach to help the aged.
CRS-6 mechanism of the old-age benefits provisions might be unconstitutional and that, at any rate, it would impose such a heavy tax burden on businesses that it would retard economic development.
The minority membership of the Ways and
Means Committee stated, in the Committee's report to the House, that the age benefits program (title II) and the method by which the money was to be raised to pay for the program (title VIII) established a "bureaucracy in the field of insurance in with private business."
They contended
further that the program would "destroy old-age retirement systems set up by private industries, which in most instances provide more liberal benefits than are contemplated under title II."
Although party members tried to remove
the old-age benefits provisions, the majority of Republicans in both chambers nevertheless did vote for the final social security bill.
During congressional debate, Democrats generally supported the proposed old-age benefits program.

House Action and
Debate on the social security bill started in the House on April lasted until April 19, 1935.
Approximately 50 amendments were offered, but According to Edwin Witte, a key player
none of them came close to passing.
in the development of the Social Security Act, House leaders passed the word around that they wanted all amendments defeated.
Four particularly significant votes were: Mr. Monaghan's amendment pro-
posing a revised Townsend plan (see pages 14-16) and Mr. Connery's amendment proposing the Lundeen plan, both amendments (described below) calling for a

On April 18, 1935, Mr. introduced in its original form by Mr. (D-Calif.) and referred to as the Townsend plan, which required the Federal Gov ernment to pay a pension to everyone 60 years of age and older, to be financed by a two percent tax on "all financial" transactions (essentially a sales tax).
(For more details on the Townsend plan see discussion of the 1939 amendments, page 14.)
Mr. Monaghan's amendment, although less costly than the original Townsend plan, was rejected by a vote of 56 to 206.

On 18, 1935, Mr. Connery (D-Mass.) offered an amendment that contained the provisions of a bill sponsored by Mr. Lundeen (Farmer-Laborite-Minn.).
The Lundeen bill, which was approved 7-6 by the House Labor Committee, called for the "establishment of a system of social insurance to compensate all workers and farmers, 18 years of age and over, in all industries, occupa tions, and professions, who are unemployed through no fault of their own . . .
Mr. Lundeen's plan offered higher bene fits than the bill, and tied benefits to the cost of living.
Under the Lundeen proposal, a more generous social insurance program was to be extended to all workers and farmers unable to work because of illness, old age, maternity, industrial injury, or any other disability.
This system was to be financed by taxes falling most heavily on persons with higher incomes (by levying additional taxation on inheritances, gifts, and individ ual and corporation incomes of $5,000 a year and over).
There was a division vote of 52 in favor and 204 opposed.

The vote on the Townsend plan amendment was not taken by roll call, but division.
Note: A division vote, also called a standing vote, is taken as follows: Members in favor of a proposal stand and are counted by a presiding officer; then Members opposed stand and are counted.
There is no record of how individual Members voted.
The members voting for the Townsend plan amendment, however, were listed in newspapers.
The majority of Members who voted for the Townsend plan were conservative Republicans who opposed the entire social security bill.

On April 18, 1935, Mr. (R-Mass.) offered an amendment to strike title II, the old-age benefits provisions, from the bill.
Mr. was opposed to the old-age benefits provision and to the taxing provisions of title VIII.
He said that it set up a form of payment that was financed in an unconstitutional manner.
He indicated that the tax would be particularly burden- some on industry, running up to six percent on payrolls.
He said that "business and industry are already operating under very heavy burdens*' and maintained that many businesses were barely able to keep their heads above water and to add a payroll tax to their burden would probably cause more unemployment and more uncertainty.
Mr. Jenkins (R-Ohio), supporter of the amendment, stated that making each worker pay three percent of his money for old-age benefits, whether he wanted to or not, and requiring employers to do the same was clearly unconstitutional.
He said, talk about wanting to relieve the depression, why talk about charity, why talk about all these other things when you are placing a financial lash upon the backs of the people whose backs are breaking under a load of debts and taxes?" He described the old-age benefits system as "compulsion of the rankest kind The amendment was defeated by a 49-125 teller d.

The recommittal motion included instructions to the Ways and Means Committee to strike out the old-age and unemploy ment insurance provisions and to increase the Federal contribu tion for the welfare program of old-age assistance, title I of the bill.

On June 19, 1935, Mr. Clark (D-MO.) offered an amendment to ex empt from coverage under the old-age benefits system employees in firms with private old-age pension systems.
This idea came from an official of a Philadelphia insurance brokerage firm that specialized in group annuity contracts.
The Ways and Means Com mittee rejected the proposal and so did the Finance Committee (by a narrow margin), but when Senator Clark offered it as an amend ment on the floor, the Senate backed him, 51 to 35, with Democrats divided and Republicans solidly in favor.
In the end, the bill's passage was dependent on deferring that particular issue.
Proponents of the amendment stated that employees would from more liberal private annuities--annuities that would be in true proportion to earnings and service; joint annuities--so as to protect spouses also; and earlier retirement for disability and other reasons.
Supporters of the amendment also maintained that the Government would benefit, due to more tax revenue, in that the reserves of private annuity plans would flow into bus iness channels and create more income to tax.
The Administration (being opposed to the amendment) argued that the amendment did not provide true retirement income guarantees because private pension programs could be cancelled, or the firm sponsoring them could go out of business.
Critics also maintained that the amend ment discouraged the employment of older men.
The Clark amendment was passed by a vote of 51 (16-R, 35-D) to 35 (3-R, 30-D, 2-I).
On June 19, 1935, Mr. Hastings (R-Del.) made a motion to strike out the old-age benefits provisions from the bill.
Mr. Hastings stated that those provisions were an effort to write into law a forced annuity system for a certain group of people.
He main tained that the reserve account to take care of people in the future was not a contract and the American public could not de pend upon it.
He also stated that the accumulation of huge sums of money for persons who had not yet reached retirement age would be subjected to all kinds of demands and most likely could not be preserved intact.
He also said "let us not deceive that youth by making him believe that here is an annuity whereby he is contrib uting 50 percent and his employer is contributing 50 percent, and that it goes to his credit, when as a matter of fact, part of it

The President sent the Social Security Board's recommendations to Congress on January 16, 1939.
The 1939 amendments incorporated most of the recommendations.
The 1939 amendments extended monthly benefits to dependents and survivors of workers covered by the social security system.

of the worker for

The starting date for monthly benefits was moved up two years with benefit payments beginning on January 1, 1940, instead of January 1, 1942.
Also, bene fits were based on average monthly wages rather than on cumulative wages.
In addition, a tax rate increase to 1.5 percent, which was scheduled to go into effect in 1940, was repealed, and Congress provided that the tax rate would be increased to 2 percent in 1943-45.
The amendments also modified qualifying
provisions, including the definition of insured status, for consistency with other changes in the Act.
In addition, people receiving OASI benefits were dollar-for-dollar deductions were to

Further, the law changed the old-age reserve account to a trust fund, managed by a board of trustees.

House Action
After holding executive sessions over a period of six weeks following pub lic hearings on the proposed amendments, the Committee on Ways and Means, on June 2, 1939, submitted to the House its report and recommendations for amend ments to the Social Security Act.
On June 1, 1939, before the Committee reported H.R. 6635, the House had engaged in five hours of debate and voted on the Townsend old-age pension bill.
The Townsend plan, embodied in a bill, H.R. 6466, introduced by Mr. in January 1935, was offered as a substitute for the Committee's old-age pension provisions.
The Townsend plan would have provided a monthly
pension of $200 to every citizen 60 years of age or older who had not been con victed of a felony.
To receive the pension, a person could not earn wages and The plan would have

been financed by a two percent tax on every commercial and financial transac tion; the President would have been given discretionary power to raise the tax to three percent or to lower it to one percent.
Mr. Townsend stated during a
1935 Ways and Means Committee hearing that his plan was only incidentally a pension plan.
He said the principal objectives of the proposal were to solve
the unemployment problem and to restore prosperity by giving purchasing power

proposed pension of $200 a month, those elderly people would have to give up their jobs, which he said meant that four million jobs would become available to middle-aged and younger people.
In addition, he said that requiring eight
million elderly persons to buy $200 worth of goods and services each month would increase demand and result in more jobs.
Mr. Sabath (D-Ill.) said he thought it was "decidedly out of place to bring the Townsend bill to the floor of the House."
He said that the bill "had no
chance of passing in the first place; neither was it feasible nor possible of operation."
Others branded the bill as "crackpot," and Members in general
fought against the bill on the basis that the social security program was a better means of caring for the aged.
Many Members asserted that any liberal
ization of pensions should be done within the framework of the Social Security Act.
Mr. Witte, in his book on the development of the Social Security Act, said: The members of the House of Representatives at all times took the Townsend movement much more seriously than did the senators.
The thousands of letters which the members received in support of this plan worried them greatly.
With the exception of probably not more than a half dozen members, all felt that the Townsend plan was utter ly impossible; at the same time they hesitated to vote against it.
The House rejected 6466, the Townsend plan bill, on June 1, 1939, by
a vote of 97 (55-R, 40-D, 2-I) to 302 (107-R, 194-D, 1-I).

CRS-16 A New York Times editorial reported that "the psychological effect of the presentation of the Townsend bill was to make these liberalized benefits [re ferring to the provisions in H.R. seem small.
Most of those who voted
against the Townsend plan will be eager to vote for these liberalized benefits to show that their hearts are in the right place.
The result is that the real
cost of the new social security scale of benefits is not likely to receive very serious attention."
The House took up the Ways and Means Committee's bill, H.R. 6635, on June 6, 1939.
The bill had the general support of the Committee.
The Repub

The Revenue Act of 1943 also contained an amendment by Senator Murray (D-Mont.) that authorized the use of general revenues if payroll taxes were insufficient to meet social security benefit obligations.
Senator Murray stated that the amendment merely stated in law what had been implied in the Senate Committee re- port.

CRS-20 Basically, Members who favored these payroll tax freezes argued that the social security reserves were adequate and that the obligations of the trust fund in the immediate future could be met with a payroll tax rate of one per- cent.
In a 1942 letter to the Senate Finance Committee, President Roosevelt
said that "a failure to allow the scheduled increase in rates to take place under the present favorable circumstances would cause a real and justifiable fear that adequate funds will not be accumulated to meet the heavy obligations of the future and that the claims for benefits accruing under the present law may be jeopardized.
He also stated that "expanded social security, together
with other fiscal measures, would set up a bulwark of economic security for the people now and after the war and at the same time would provide inflationary sources for financing the war."
Members who were opposed to
the freeze argued that the scheduled payroll tax increase was important for the long-term soundness of the OASI trust fund and that postponing the tax increase would mean higher payroll tax rates in the future and perhaps Govern ment subsidies to meet obligations.
Some proponents of the freeze maintained
that the Administration wanted the tax increase to retire the public debt accumulated by wartime expenditures.
Although Senator Vandenberg (R-Mich.) was the main spokesman for postpon ing the payroll tax increases, the legislative effort to defer tax increases was bipartisan.
"Without regard to party or ideology, elected representatives
of the people were not willing to argue for increases in an earmarked tax if a current need for them could not be demonstrated," one scholar has observed.

Two pieces of 1948 legislation, H.R. 5052 and
argument of who was considered an employee for purposes of social security coverage
The term "employee" was not defined in the
Security Act nor
in the pertinent section of the Internal Revenue Code.
However, in 1936 the Social Security Board and the Treasury Department issued regulations which to a certain extent explained the meaning of the terms "employee" and "employer."
Both sets of regulations emphasized the legal right to control the performance of service in defining `*employer but other significant factors such as the
the right to discharge, the furnishing of tools and the furnishing of a place to work were also mentioned in the regulations.
During the first years of op
eration of the regulations, the Social Security Board and the Treasury Depart ment issued numerous rulings to clarify the boundaries of the employee-employer relationship and a number of court cases established generally applicable prec edents.
The common-law meaning of the term employee, however, was very unclear
in cases of outside salesmen.
On December 31, 1946, the U.S. district court, in the case of Hearst Publi cations, Inc. v.
The United States, ruled that newspaper vendors were to be con sidered employees rather than independent contractors.
H.R. 5052, introduced
in 1948, proposed to treat newspaper and magazine vendors as independent con- tractors rather than employees and thereby to exclude them from social security

It was repo-ted that H.J. Res. 296 was primarily introduced
to prevent the release of new Federal regulations defining the meaning of the term "employee" along the lines interpreted by the Supreme Court in three cases decided in June 1947.
H.J. Res. 296 excluded from social security coverage
(and unemployment insurance) any person who was not considered an employee under the common-law rules.
Res. 296, in effect, said that independent contrac
tors (e.g., door-to-door salesmen, insurance salesmen, and pieceworkers) were not to be considered employees.

H.R. 5052 and H.J. Res. 296 were vetoed by

In his veto of H.R. 5052, President Truman asserted that the Nation's secu rity and welfare demanded an expansion of the Social Security program to cover the groups excluded from the Social Security program: step in the opposite
direction can only serve to undermine the program and destroy the confidence of our people in the permanence of its protection against the hazards of old age, premature death, and unemployment The basic controversy over the question
of who was actually covered under Social Security and the policy issue involved is reflected by the action taken on H.R. 5052.

(R-Calif.) asked unanimous consent a.
On March 4, 1948, Mr. for immediate consideration of H.R. 5052.
Mr. stated that "until the rendition of the Federal court decisions I have referred to were rendered the status of the newspaper and magazine vendors was considered by everyone, and as this Congress clearly intended, to be that of independent contractors since they bought their periodicals at a low price and sold them at a higher price, deriving their livelihood from the profit in the operation."
Un der the court decisions "these vendors were arbitrarily declared to be employees and therefore subject to the payroll taxes though the money they receive is not wages, as generally understood, but profits derived from an independent business operation of their own."
Under the court decisions, newspaper and magazine vendors were in essence "employees" of all of the newspaper and magazine companies with which they had an arrangement.
Mr. Gearhart's ba sic contention was that vendors were really independent contrac tors and were never intended to be covered as "employees" by the Social Security Act.
Mr. Gearhart's bill excluded these newspa per and magazine vendors from coverage under the Social Security Act.

Veto
a.
On April 6, 1948, in the veto message on H.R. 5052, President Truman stated that some vendors work under arrangements "which make them bona fide employees of the publishers, and, conse quently, are entitled to the benefits of the Social Security Act President Truman further stated that "It is said that news vendors affected by this bill could more appropriately be covered by the social security laws as independent contractors when and if coverage is extended to the self-employed.
Whether that is true or not, surely they should continue to receive the benefits to which they are now entitled until the broader cover- age is provided.
It would be most inequitable to extinguish their present rights pending a determination as to whether it is more appropriate for them to be covered on some other basis."
b.
On June 14, 1948, President Truman vetoed 296, saying that "If our social security program is to endure, it must be protected against these piecemeal attacks.
Coverage must be per manently expanded and no employer or special group of employers should be permitted to reverse that trend by efforts to avoid the burden which millions of other employers have carried without serious inconvenience or complaint.

Congress, Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 (H.R. 6000) The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 were signed into law on
August 28, 1950, by President Truman.
The amendments broadened the Social
Security Act to cover roughly 10 million additional persons, including regu larly employed farm and domestic workers, self-employed people other than doctors, lawyers, engineers and certain other professional groups, certain Federal employees not covered by government pension plans, and workers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
On a voluntary group basis, coverage was
offered to employees of State and local governments not under public employee retirement systems and to employees of nonprofit organizations.
The amendments
also made benefits available to dependent husbands, dependent widowers, and, under certain circumstances, children of insured women (under the 1939 amend ments such benefits were not generally available to children of women workers).
In addition, Congress raised benefits by about 77 percent; raised the wage base from $3,000 to $3,600; raised employer and employee taxes gradually from

House Action 6000,
On August 22, 1949, the Committee on Ways and Means reported
a bill granting a substantial portion of the President's recommendations for broader social security coverage (virtually identical requests were made in the 1948, 1949, and 1950 budgets) and making other significant changes.
6000 did not include President Truman's recommendations for health insurance nor his request to lower the OASI eligibility age to 60 for women, but it did include disability protection for both social security and public assistance recipients; further, it extended coverage to farm and domestic workers.
All 10 Republicans on the Committee (including 7 who voted to send H.R. 6000 to the floor) filed a minority report stating that OASI coverage and
In 1952 the same military wage credits were extended to periods of service up to December 31, 1953.
Then, in 1953 they were extended to periods of service up to June 20, 1955, in 1955 to periods of service up to March 31, 1956, and in 1956 to periods of service to December 31, 1956.
The 1967 amend ments gave military wage credits of $300 per calendar quarter of service after 1967 (amended in 1972 to be effective in 1957).
The 1977 amendments gave wage credits of $100 per $300 of basic pay, up to a maximum of $1,200 credit per year, beginning in 1978.
CRS-27 benefits should be limited so as to provide only a "basic floor" of economic protection.
The minority report opposed the disability insurance provision,
saying that aid to the disabled should be limited to charity aid provided under the proposed public assistance program for the permanently and totally disabled.
The Committee on Rules at first refused to send 6000 to the floor,
but, after much debate, a closed rule barring floor amendments was granted.
A number of Members opposed the rule because they said it foreclosed their right to improve the bill through floor amendments.
a.
On October four days and Means motion to 4, 1949, Mr. Sabath (D-Ill.) offered a resolution for 6000, with only the Committee on Ways of debate on having the right to offer amendments, and with only the recommit being in order.
Those favoring the resolution for a closed rule stated that the Ways and Means Committee had devoted six months to considering the bill, had heard testimony from 250 witnesses and thus knew best how to improve the program.
Those opposing the closed rule said the bill was very controversial and that the whole House should settle difficult questions of policy.
They said the closed rule negated the importance of other House Members and in fact usurped their rights.
The House agreed to the resolution for a closed rule by a vote of 189 (12-R, 176-D, 1-I) to 135 (123-R, 12-D) on October 4, 1949.
b.
On October 5, 1949, Mr. Mason (R-Ill.) moved to recommit H.R. 6000, and offered 6297 (a bill which carried out the mi nority view on H.R. 6000) as a substitute for H.R. 6000.
The minority bill, 6297, introduced by Mr. Kean (R-N.J.) on October 3, 1949, held the wage base to $3,000; recommended greater coverage for domestic workers so that those who were less regularly employed would be included; exempted teachers, firemen, and policemen with their own pension systems from

Senate Action
Since Congress adjourned shortly after the House action, the Senate did not consider 6000 until 1950.
The Senate Finance Committee held extensive
hearings and adopted many amendments to H.R. 6000.
The Committee stated that the chief purpose of the bill was to strengthen the OASI system so that OASI would be the primary method of offering "basic security to retired persons and survivors with public assistance (particularly old-age assistance) play

Under this proposal, all elderly persons in the U.S. would become eligible for subsistence-level pensions at age 65, with no eligi bility requirements except being age 65, with pension amounts the same for all (rather than varied to reflect earnings during the work career), and with pensions financed from current revenues rather than from a trust fund. b.

House Action
In the House, debate centered largely on a so-called "disability freeze" provision proposed by the Committee on Ways and Means.
Under the provision, if a person became permanently and totally disabled, the period of disability was to be excluded in computing the number of quarters in covered employment he needed to be eligible for OASI benefits at age 65 (or for survivors' ben efits), and in computing the average monthly wage on which his OASI benefits would be based.
The provision, in effect, preserved benefit rights for per- The Ways and Means provision specifically

provided for medical examinations by doctors and public institutions to be designated and paid for by the Federal Security Agency (FSA).
The American Medical Association (AMA) claimed that allowing the FSA to make disability determinations would lead to socialized medicine.

On June 16, 1952, Democratic leaders brought H.R. 7800 to the floor under suspension of the rules.
An amended version of the revised bill empowered the FSA to make disability determinations, but omitted the language specifying how the FSA administrator should do so.
Mr. Reed said . . let no person on this floor be deceived.
You have the same old 7800 here before you.
While the socialized medicine advocates pretend to remove the specific instructions to the Administrator, they now give him more powers under general provisions of the law than he had before.
You have socialized medicine here stronger in this bill than was 7800, heretofore defeated.*' Mr. Reed later contended that because of the many Members chose to go on record in favor of the other OASI provi sions and so voted for the amended version of H.R. 7800.

Conference Action The
The conferees retained the disability freeze provision, in principle.
compromise terminated the freeze provision on June 30, 1953; at the same time, it did not allow an application to be accepted before July 1, 1953.
Thus, the disability freeze provision was made inoperative unless Congress, in subsequent legislation, were to take action to remove the bar.
The stated intent in making
the provision inoperative was to permit "the working out of tentative agreements with the States for possible administration of these provisions.`* In addi
tion, the conferees gave responsibility for determining whether an applicant was disabled to appropriate State agencies (public assistance, vocational rehabili tation, or workmen's compensation), instead of the FSA.
The Federal Security
Administrator would be able to overturn a ruling by the State agencies that a person was disabled, but would not be able to reverse a ruling by the State agencies that a person was not disabled.

The Social Security Amendments of 1954 ex-
tended (1) mandatory coverage to, among others, some self-employed farmers, self-employed engineers, architects, accountants, and funeral directors, all Federal employees not covered by government pension plans, farm and domestic service workers not covered by the 1950 amendments, and (2) voluntary coverage to ministers, and certain State and local government employees already covered by staff retirement systems.
The bill also raised the wage base for the OASI
tax from $3,600 a year to $4,200; raised the tax rate to 3.5 percent each for employer and employees beginning in 1970, and to 4.0 percent each beginning in 1975, with the tax rate for the self-employed continuing at 1.5 times the employee rate (or 75 percent of the combined employee-employer rate).
OASI
monthly benefits were raised by roughly 15 percent for those already receiving them, with the maximum individual benefit rising from $85 to $98.50, and a re- vised benefit formula was provided for future retirees which increased benefits by roughly 27 percent, with the maximum individual benefit rising from $85 a month to $108.50.
The bill also put the disability freeze into effect (with
disability determinations to be made by the appropriate State agencies), permitted an OASI retiree to earn up to $1,200 a year without deductions and eliminated the retirement (earnings) test for people age 72 and over, and per mitted the five years of lowest earnings to be dropped out of average monthly wage determinations for purposes of computing OASI monthly benefits.
Periods of long-term disability would not be counted against an in computing quarters of coverage and average monthly wages on which OASI benefits were based.
The effect was to preserve OASI benefit rights for people who would have lost them because they were disabled and not working in covered employment for long periods before reaching retirement age.

waiting period, for permanently and totally disabled workers aged 50
to 64, who were fully and currently insured and had at least 20 quarters of coverage in the lo-year period prior to becoming disabled; provided benefits to a dependent child 18 and older of a deceased or retired insured worker if the child became disabled before age 18; made benefits payable to women workers and wives at the age of 62, instead of 65, with actuarially reduced benefits; reduced from 65 to 62 the age at which benefits were payable to widows or par ents, with no reduction; extended coverage to lawyers, dentists, veterinarians,

increased the tax rate by 0.25 percent on employer and employee each (0.375 percent for self-employed people) to finance disability benefits (thereby raising the aggregate tax rate ultimately to 4.25 percent); and created a separate disability insurance (DI) trust fund.
The Social Security program
was now comprised of old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI).
1.
House Act ion
Major House Ways and Means Committee provisions reduced the age at which women could first receive OASI benefits to 62 and provided social security ben efits to disabled persons age 50 and older.
Although some Members maintained
that not enough time was spent in working out the details of the two controver sial provisions mentioned above, H.R. 7225 was brought to the floor under the suspension of the rules procedure, which barred floor amendments and required a two-thirds vote for passage.
H.R. 7225 was passed by the House on July 18,
1955, by a vote of 372 (169-R, 203-D) to 31 (23-R, 8-D).

According to Congress and the Nation, Mr. Folsom said that OASI had
stayed actuarially sound without excessive taxes because it had been restricted to one purpose with "predictable costs": providing income for the aged.
/
Spokesmen for the AFL-CIO and several other groups maintained that union expe rience with welfare plans and Federal studies dating back to 1937 showed that disability insurance was both administratively and financially sound.

On June 5, 1956, the Senate Finance Committee reported H.R. 7225 after eliminating the Disability Insurance program and the tax increase to pay for it, and limiting retirement benefits at age 62 to widows only. b.
On July 17, 1956, Mr. George (D-Ga.) offered an amendment rein- stating the Disability Insurance program and the tax increase to finance it.
The amendment provided for a separate disability insurance trust fund (instead of operating the new program out of the OASI fund).
The amendment was passed by a vote of 47 (6-R, 41-D) to 45 (38-R, 7-D).
/ Also, on July 17, 1956, the Senate agreed to Mr. Kerr's (D-Okla.) amendment that permitted all women eligible for OASI benefits to receive them at age 62, though at actuarially reduced rates for women receiving a retired worker's benefit or a wife's benefit.
The amendment passed by a vote of 86 (40-R, 46-D) to 7 (5-R, 2-D).

On July 17, 1956, the Senate passed H.R. 7225 by a vote of 90 / (45-R, 45-D) to 0.
Mr. Folsom further stated that until it was known what the ultimate be, whether it was possible to make disability determinations good enough to avoid "fraudulent" claims for benefits, and whether the availability of disability pensions might discourage individual rehabilitative efforts, add ing disability insurance to OASI would risk `*overburdening and thus wrecking'* the social security system.

On August 15, 1958, Mr. Yarborough (D-Tex.) offered an amendment to increase social security benefits by 10 percent (rather than 13549).
Mr. Yarborough stated 7 percent, as proposed in that in many States old-age public assistance payments were high er than the "social security payments the people have earned by putting their money into the social security fund."
/ Proponents of the amendment mentioned that a LO percent increase would alleviate erosion of benefits due to inflation.
Opponents of the amendment argued that many persons getting social security also received income from other sources.
Some opponents of the amendment maintained that it would jeopardize the enactment of the bill.

CRS-4 3 J. 86-778, Social Security Amendments of 1960 (H.R. 12580) The Social Security Amendments of 1960 were signed into law on Septem ber 13, 1960, by President Eisenhower.
Although a number of OASDI provisions At the
were enacted, health care for the aged was the primary issue in 1960.
crux of the debate was the question of whether the Federal Government should assume major responsibility for the health care of the Nation's elderly people, and, if so, whether medical assistance should be provided through the social security system or through the public assistance programs (charity approach).
The 1960 amendments made available to States more Federal funds for age assistance (OAA) programs so that States, at their option, would be able to improve or establish medical care services to OAA recipients.
In addition,
the amendments known as the so-called "Kerr-Mills" legislation established a new voluntary program (under jurisdiction of the program) of medical assis
tance for the aged, under which States received Federal funds to help pay for medical care for persons aged 65 and older who were not recipients of OAA but whose income and resources were insufficient to meet their medical expenses.
The 1960 amendments also contained a number of OASDI provisions.
The amendments made disability benefits available to workers under age 50; estab lished a new retirement test whereby each dollar of earnings between $1,200 and $1,500 per year would cause only a reduction in benefit amount
with a dollar-for-dollar reduction for earnings above $1,500; liberalized requirements for fully insured status so that to be eligible for benefits a person needed only one quarter of covered work for every three calendar quar ters (rather than one for every two quarters, as under the old law) elapsing after 1950 and before retirement, disability, or death; and raised the survi vor benefit of each child to 75 percent of what his deceased parent's benefit would have been.
CRS-44 1.
House Action
H.R. 12580 as reported by the Ways and Means Committee contained two medi cal care provisions for elderly people.
The first provision provided the States
with additional funding to improve or to establish medical care programs for old-age assistance recipients.
The second provision established a new
State program (under a new title of the Social Security Act) designed to assist aged persons who were not eligible for public assistance but who were unable to pay their medical bills (medically needy persons).
The Ways and Means Committee rejected introduced by Mr. 4700, a health insurance bill bill would
by a vote of 17 to 8.
The
have provided insurance against the cost of hospital, nursing home, and surgi cal services for persons eligible for OASDI benefits.
Proponents of the health care provisions in 12580 said that it pro
vided a medical assistance program for every aged person in any State that implemented one, whether the person was on old-age assistance or on social security, or on neither, if the person had a need for medical Mr. Thompson (D-N.J.), a supporter of the charity approach built into bill as opposed to the
12580, stated that people would be "denied
the opportunity of contributing to their old-age health insurance coverage while employed and would be forced to rely upon charity after their working days were over."
/ They contended further that "even this charity . . . is /
contingent upon the action of the separate States."

Social Security Amendments of 1965 6675)
The Social Security Amendments of 1965 were signed into law on July 30, 1965, by President Johnson.
Although a federally operated health insurance
program covering the entire nation was considered by the Roosevelt Administra tion in 1935, it was not explicitly endorsed until January 1945, when President Roosevelt's budget message called for an *'extended social security including medical care."
Such a plan was submitted to Congress by President Truman in
November 1945, but neither chamber acted on the proposal.
One of the reasons for this was the strong opposition by the AMA.
The controversy surrounding the
establishment of a Federal health insurance program for the aged was finally ended in 1965, when Congress enacted 6675.
The 1965 amendments estab (title XVIII

The costs of hospitalization and related care
would be met in part by a compulsory program of Hospital Insurance (HI, part A), financed by a separate payroll tax.
The program would serve beneficiaries
of the social security and railroad retirement programs, age 65 and older.
A voluntary Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) plan (part B) would help pay doctor bills and related services, for all persons age 65 and older, financed through monthly premiums paid by the beneficiary and a matching Federal payment from general revenues.
The amendments also provided a seven percent across-the-board increase in OASDI benefits, extended compulsory self-employment coverage to doctors, made child's benefits available through age 21 if the child attended school full time (under prior law, they were available only through age permitted

During its long legislative history prior to 1965, a Federal hospital insurance program, "medicare," had been passed only once by the Senate, in 1964, and then by a narrow margin.
It had never been approved by the House

The Ways and Means Committee began holding executive sessions on H.R. 1, a bill to establish a social insurance program for hospital and related care for the aged, on January 27, 1965.

Supporters said it
Critics opposed its compulsory nature, argued that it would
be financed by a "regressive" payroll tax, and said it would endanger the social security cash benefit program.
Republican spokesmen instead wanted a
voluntary health plan (as opposed to a mandatory social insurance approach) with a medicaid-like program underpinning it to provide medical assistance for the needy aged. a.
On April 8, 1965, the House rejected Mr. Byrnes' (R-Wis.) motion to recommit 6675 to the Ways and Means Committee with in structions to substitute the text of H.R. 7057, a that Mr. Byrnes had introduced a week earlier.
H.R. 7057 was not offered as an amendment because the rule did not permit such action.
7057 provided for all hospitalization, nursing home care, or medical and surgical care to be financed through a voluntary system with payment partially made by the person receiving the medical care and partially out of general revenues rather than from a tax on the payrolls of employers.

The bill also provided for future automatic-increases in social security bene fits when the consumer price index (CPI) rose by three percent or more.
To finance the increase, the taxable wage base was raised from $9,000 to $10,800 in 1973 and to $12,000 in 1974, with automatic adjustment thereafter.
The Congressional Quarterly Almanac reported that: Backers of the social security benefits package decided to attach it to the debt increase bill for two reasons: President Nixon, who op posed a increase as inflationary, would be unlikely to veto a bill that contained a debt limit increase.

House Response to Senate Amendment
The House did not concur with the Senate-passed amendment that provided for a 20 percent social security benefit increase and sent the debt ceiling bill to the conference committee on June 30, 1972.
Immediate congressional action was
necessary because the debt limit was to revert automatically to $400 billion (from the existing $450 billion) at midnight on June 30, 1972.

Conference Action
On June 30, 1972, the conferees informally accepted the Senate-passed ver sion of H.R. 15390.
Under the House rules, however, House conferees could not
agree to nongermane amendment6 added by the Senate unless specifically autho rized; such amendments had to be individually approved by majority vote of the House.
Thus, the conference report was reported back to the House in disagree
ment because House conferees had not been authorized to accept the nongermane Senate amendments.
a.
On June 30, 1972, Mr. Byrnes called the proposed 20 percent increase "irresponsible" and moved that the House concur with the Senate-passed amendment provided that the social security benefit increase be limited to 10 percent.
Mr. Byrnes' motion was rejected by a vote of 83 (63-R, to 253 (73-R, 180-D).

CRS-70 92-603, Social Security Amendments of 1972 (H.R. 1) The Social Security Amendments of 1972 were signed into law on October 30, 1972, by President Nixon.
During the period 1969-72, Congress raised OASDI benefits three times.
In 1969, benefits were raised 15 percent; in 1971, they were raised 10 percent, and a further 20 percent increase was voted in 1972 (P.L. 92-336).
92-336
also provided for future automatic benefit increases, starting in January 1975 in a year when the consumer price index rose more three percent.
All three
benefit increases were voted as amendment6 to bills dealing with other subjects.
President Nixon had requested a number of other social security liberalizations in 1969, but those proposals were entangled with his controversial welfare reform plan.
It was not until 1972, when H.R. 1 became P.L. 1 that the
requested social security recommendation6 became law.
The 1972 amendments (H.R. 1) contained numerous liberalizations, such as increased benefits for widows and widowers; an increase in earnings permitted without a reduction in benefits, from $1,680 to $2,100 with automatic adjustment . to wages thereafter, for earnings above $2,100 benefits were reduced dollar without limit; a reduction in the waiting period for disability benefit6 six months to five months; an extension of protection to disabled years;
beneficiaries who had been on the social security rolls for at
and a special minimum benefit of up to $170 a month for those who had worked covered employment for a Substantial number of years, but at low earnings.
In addition, OASDHI tax rate increases scheduled for the periods 1973-77;

This increase was in lieu of a 5.9 93-66, that had been enacted
percent increase scheduled by legislation, in July 1973.
/ In passing H.R. 11333, congressional sentiment was that
the earlier increase was inadequate to meet the unusually rapid increase in inflation then occurring.
93-233 increased benefits by seven percent in March 1974 and by another four percent in June 1974.
To finance the provisions, the social security taxable wage base was increased to $13,200 in January 1974.
(It had
already been scheduled to increase from $12,000 to $12,600 under P.L. 93-66.)
In addition, the automatic cost-of-living mechanism was revised.
Under P.L. the automatic benefit increase was to be based on the rise in the CPI from the first quarter of one year to the first quarter of the next year rather than second quarter to second quarter, with automatic adjustments starting in June 1975 rather than in January.
As a result, cost-of-living increases would

House Action
With a rule allowing only one floor amendment (pertaining to SSI) to H.R. 11333, the House passed H.R. 11333 on November 15, 1973. ,
The November 14-15 debate on H.R. 11333 was devoted to the need for a quick cost-of-living social security benefit increase and to questions about the fis cal soundness of the social security trust funds.

The Social Security Amendments of 1977 were signed into law on December 20, 1977, by President Carter.
The amendments were passed to meet major social se
curity financing problems that emerged in the mid-1970s.
The Congressional Quarterly Almanac says that the main cause of the immediate financial problems was the "combination of rapid inflation and a recession, which together raised social security benefit costs and reduced tax receipts."

fixing the short-run problems, the amendments sought to eliminate the range deficit (over the next 25 years) and to reduce the projected long-range

CRS-78 deficit (next 75 years) from over 8 percent of taxable payroll to less than 1.5 percent.
Two issues of primary significance were (1) raising income for the
system to handle the short-term financing problem either through increased pay- roll taxes or infusions from the general fund; and (2) modifying the benefit formula (i.e., decoupled) to stabilize replacement rates in the future, and, thereby, to reduce and possibly eliminate the projected long-run deficit.
Neither House of Congress gave much attention to a Carter Administration proposal to authorize use of general revenues for social security during periods of high (the so-called "countercyclical" use of general revenues).
Instead, the new law increased social security tax rates and the taxable earn ings base and reduced expenditures to remedy the short-run financing short-fall (mostly the former).
The final bill contained decoupling procedures, which
also had been supported by the Ford Administration, for correcting a very basic flaw in the benefit computation formula, and thereby largely reduced the run problem.
P.L. 95-216 also liberalized the **retirement test" by providing
a five-step ad hoc increase in the amount beneficiaries age 65 and over could earn without losing a portion of their benefits (the amount for persons under age 65 continued to be adjusted only for increases in average wages after 1978); eliminated the retirement test for beneficiaries aged 70 and over (reduced from age beginning in 1982; and liberalized the treatment of divorced and wid-
owed beneficiaries.

Legislation that incorporated the Administration's recommendations (H.R. 8218) was introduced on July 12, 1977, by Mr. Burke (D-Mass.), Chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee.

On October 26, 1977, an amendment from the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service was considered.
The amendment would have deleted the provision in the Ways Committee bill covering Federal, State, local, and nonprofit employees under the Social Security program.
b.
Mr. Fisher (D-Va.) offered a substitute for the Post Office and Civil Service Committee amendment.
The Fisher substitute pro vided that Federal employees would continue to be exempt from the social security system, as under old law, and that State and local governments and nonprofit organizations would continue to have the option to elect to cover their employees.
While the amendment deleted mandatory coverage of these employees, the bill retained a provision requiring a study of mandatory cover- age to be conducted jointly by the Civil Service Commission, the Departments of Treasury and Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Office of Management and Budget.
Many Members endorsed the concept of universal mandatory social security coverage, but sup- porters of the Fisher amendment asserted that a study of the uni versal coverage issue should be conducted first.
Opponents, on the other hand, argued that the Committee bill, by postponing the extension of coverage until 1982, allowed sufficient time to work out details. / The amendment also provided in

However, under the rule for floor debate, the bill as reported by the Ways and Means Committee was to be the vehicle for floor consideration.

Mr. Fisher's substitute amendment was agreed to by a 386 (129-R, 257-D) to 38 (14-R, 24-D).

Mr. Pickle argued that any use of general treasury funds for social security undermined the contributory nature of the program.
He remarked that he did not want to see the Social Security program turned into a **welfare or need program."

Preliminary hearings and mark-up sessions on financing and decoupling were held by the Senate Committee on Finance in the summer and fall of 1977, even though the House had not yet passed its social security bill.
/
Before H.R. 9346 was passed by the House, the Finance Committee had tenta tively agreed that its amendments would be attached to H.R. 5322, an unrelated tariff bill that had originated in the House.
H.R. 5322 was to be a convenient
vehicle for putting the Senate Finance Committee proposals before the Senate promptly.

When 9346 as passed by the House came up for debate on the Senate floor on November 2, 1977, Mr. Long (D-La.) introduced an amendment to substitute the Finance Committee social security proposals in H.R. 5322 for the House bill.
The Finance Committee proposals included a provision requiring employers to pay social security taxes on a higher wage base than employees.
It also included decoupling measures similar to those in the House bill.
Mr. Long's amendment was agreed to with no recorded vote.
Thus, the text of 5322 became 9346 as amended Senate.
b.
On November 3, 1977, Mr. Curtis (R-Nebr.) offered an amendment that would have kept the taxable wage base the same for employers and employees (at the level specified for employees in the Commit- tee proposal) but would have raised the tax rate above the Commit- tee-recommended levels.
Mr. Curtis said his amendment would take care of the deficit in the social security fund.
He stated that raising the wage base would put half of the financing burden ex clusively on the people with higher incomes.
Mr. Nelson (D-Wise.) acknowledged that the Curtis amendment would supply the necessary funding to keep the retirement system sol- vent, but stressed that the average worker would pay a higher tax under the Curtis plan than under the Committee proposal.
Mr. Nel son's motion to table the Curtis amendment lost by a vote of 44 (3-R, 41-D) to 45 (31-R, 14-D), but the Senate then rejected the Curtis amendment, 40 (27-R, to 50 (7-R, 43-D).

On November 4, 1977, Mr. Goldwater offered an amendment to lower from 72 to 65 (in 1982) the age at which a person's earn ings would not cause a loss of benefits (the retirement test).
Mr. Goldwater said that his amendment would end the discrimina tion that allowed full benefits to relatively wealthy retirees who had unearned income in excess of $3,000, but reduced benefits for retirees who relied entirely on additional earned income to supplement their social security benefits.
Opponents of the amendment said that it would provide a windfall to professionals who continued to work at lucrative jobs past retirement age.
Mr. Church (D-Idaho) offered a substitute amendment to lower from 72 to 70 the age at which the retirement test would no longer

Rather than phase out-the retirement test, as in the

The amendments also made similar changes in disability payments under the SSI program.
The new law further established a new program of voluntary Federal
certification of "medigap" insurance policies sold by private insurance compa nies to supplement Federal health insurance.

House Action
The Subcommittee on Social Security of the House Ways and Means Committee held public hearings in February and March 1979.
Following these hearings, the Subcommittee held mark-up sessions on H.R. 2854, the Administration's proposals, and incorporated its recommendations into a new bill, H.R. 3236, which was in troduced in the House on March 27, 1979.
After considering the Subcommittee's
recommendations, the full Committee on Ways and Means reported the bill to the House on April 23, 1979.
Action on the bill was delayed as several major groups
raised questions about the legislation, and controversy arose as to the rules under which the bill would be considered on the House floor.
Many of the inter
ested parties wanted an opportunity to consider several of the provisions sepa rately when 3236 was considered on the floor, rather than to simply vote The House Committee on Rules held hearings
for or against the bill as a whole.
CRS-86 on June 6 and 7, 1979, and reported out on June 7, 1979, H. Res. 310, which provided for a modified rule and one hour of debate on H.R. 3236.
The rule provided that the only amendments that would be in order would be those recom mended by the Ways and Means Committee (which were not amendable) and an amend ment offered by Mr. Simon (D-Ill.) that would delay the implementation of a provision affecting vocational year 1982.
According to the Congressional Quarterly Almanac, even after the rule was passed, "the opposition coalition was able to block floor consideration of the measure for three months."

On January 30, 1980, Mr. Bayh (D-Ind.) offered an amendment to start paying disability benefits to terminally ill applicants as soon as they were unable to continue working, repealing the program's waiting period for them.
The amendment was limited to people who had a disease that would probably result in death within a year; in the opinion of two doctors.
It retained a five-month waiting period for other disability insurance appli cants.
Mr. Bayh said it was cruel to deny assistance to des perately ill people on the basis of an arbitrary waiting period that lasted longer than most of them were likely to live.
Mr. Long (D-La.) said elimination of the waiting period for one group would eventually lead to its elimination for all disabled persons, at a cost of $3 billion a year.
Mr. Long also argued that the amendment was not germane since there was nothing in the bill relating to the waiting period The amend ment was ruled out of order.
But the Senate voted 37 (19-R, D) to 55 (17-R, 38-D) against the ruling of the chair, and then adopted the Bayh amendment by a vote of 70 (25-R, to 23 (12-R, 11-D).

He also stated that *'Reallocation, the mechanism used in 7670, has been the traditional way of redistributing the OASDI tax rates when there have been changes in the law and in the experience of programs and in order to keep all the programs on a more or less even reserve ratio."
Mr. Pickle further remarked, "Reallocation means that the formula for allocating the incoming payroll tax receipts is changed in the law so that funds will flow into the various funds in a different mix than currently projected."

CRS-96 The adoption of the rule for floor consideration of the reconciliation bill became, in itself, a highly controversial issue.
The Democratic leader- ship argued for allowing six separate votes on the grounds that this would allow for greater accountability for individual Members and avoid criticisms of "rubber-stamping" the Administration's proposals.
/ "A bipartisan group
of Members (generally supported by the Administration) argued instead for a substitute rule that would allow first for consideration of a major substitute for the Budget Committee bill and then only for an up-or-down vote" / on a
different substitute sponsored by Mr. Gramm (D-Texas) and Mr. Latta (R-Ohio).

Conference Action
The passage of the alternative budget package resulted in House-passed social security measures that were very similar to the Administration's original proposals and to those in the Senate-passed reconciliation bill.
On July 13, 1981, the Senate voted to substitute the reconciliation proposals from S. 1377 for those passed by the House in the differences.

On July 30, 1981, Mr. Bolling (D-MO.), Chairman of the House Rules Commit- tee, threatened to prevent the conference agreement from being brought to the House floor for final approval until something could be worked out to modify the minimum benefit provision.
An agreement was worked out permitting a bill
that would modify the minimum benefit provision to be brought to the House floor before the vote on the reconciliation conference report.

The minimum benefit is the smallest benefit (before actuarial reduc tion test reduction) payable to a worker or from which benefits to his survivors/dependents will be determined.
In 1977, the minimum benefit was frozen at $122 per month for all workers who became disabled after 1978 and all survivors of workers who died after 1978.
The new frozen minimum of $122 was to have applied to all retired workers reaching age 62 in 1984 or later.
How- ever, this 1981 legislation eliminated the minimum benefit for all people becom ing eligible for benefits in January 1982 or later (except for certain members of religious orders who have taken a vow of poverty; such people are exempt from the new law for 10 years).
These people have their benefits computed under the regular benefit computation rules.
People already eligible for benefits before January 1, 1982, are able to continue receiving the minimum benefit.

The Congressional Quarterly Almanac states that the major dispute of the six-week-long conference was whether the cost of restoring the minimum benefit would be paid by tax increases or by benefit cuts.
Senate and House conferees
finally agreed to accept only the sick pay tax "on the condition that interfund borrowing be allowed for just one year."
/ The conference agreement restored
the minimum benefit to all persons eligible for benefits before 1982 and to mem bers of certain religious orders who were or would become eligible for benefits before 1992, and it rejected the Senate provisions (1) to reduce the minimum for those also receiving Government pensions above $300 per month and (2) to limit further family benefits in OASI cases.

the Social Security program (OASDI) was projected to
run out of necessary funds by the middle of 1983, and to need about $150 to $200 billion to provide reasonable assurance that it would remain solvent for the rest of the decade.
Once this short-run problem was addressed, the
projections showed that the program would enjoy adequate financing for about 35 years.
However, beginning about 2025, the effects of the retirement of the baby-boom generation would plunge the system into deficit again.
The National Commission on Social Security Reform, a bipartisan panel appointed by President Reagan and congressional leaders, was formed to seek a solution to the system's and long-term financing problems.
On January 15, 1983, a majority of
the Commission members reached agreement on a package of changes.
Tailored heavily around the Commission's package, the 1983 amendments put new Federal employees and all nonprofit organization employees under the OASDI program as of January 1, 1984, prohibited State and local and nonprofit agen cies from terminating social security coverage, moved the annual cost-of-living adjustments in benefits from July to January of each year (which caused a delay of six months in made up to one-half of the benefits received by higher

On March 9, 1983, the House debated the bill.
Proponents of the Commit-

Conference Action
On March 24, 1983, House and Senate conferees agreed to the final provi sions of H.R. 1900 during a session.
The primary issue debated by conferees was how to solve the system's run financial problems.
The House measure called for a 2-year increase in the
retirement age, while the Senate bill proposed to increase the retirement age to 66, eliminate the retirement test, and cut initial benefit payments 5 per- cent.
Another major difference was a provision in the Senate bill delaying
coverage of new Federal employees until a supplemental civil service retirement plan could be developed.
House conferees charged that if the change were made,
no revenues from the proposed coverage could be counted on for the social secu rity bailout plan since, if such a plan were not subsequently developed, Federal workers might escape coverage altogether.
The conferees agreed to the House retirement age change.
Senate conferees then agreed to recede on the Federal employee coverage issue.

House Action 3755
On March 14, 1984, the House Committee on Ways and Means reported with amendments.
a.
During debate on H.R. 3755, Mr. (R-N.Y.) remarked that the intent of the 1980 legislation, requiring continuing disa bility reviews, was meritorious . . but the results were not what the drafters intended.
Mr. further stated, "Not only were ineligible beneficiaries terminated, but some eligi ble beneficiaries were taken from the rolls, as well.
Many, especially those with mental impairments, suffered duress and the economic hardship of interrupted benefits."
Mr. also said, "Both Congress and the administration have taken remedial steps . . . we approved 97-455, which, on an in terim basis, provided for the continuation of benefits during an appeal of an adverse decision . . .
3755 represents the next step."
The sponsor of 3755, Mr. Pickle (D-Tex.), said, "In the past three years nearly half a million disabled beneficiaries have been notified that their benefits will end.
Far too often this notice has been sent in error, and corrected only at the benefi ciary's expense . . . .
Let me assure the members that we who serve on the Social Security Subcommittee have heard those pleas from the disabled, and from the Governors, and from those who must administer this program in the States.
And for over a year now we have carefully drafted legislation to bring order to the

Administrative Action
Six months before continuing disability review legislation was enacted, Secretary Heckler imposed a nationwide moratorium on periodic continuing disa bility reviews.
The Secretary said:
Although we have made important progress in reforming the review process with Social Security, the confusion of differing court orders and State actions persists.
The disability program cannot serve those who need its help when its policies are splintered and divided.
For that reason, we must suspend the process and work to gether with Congress to regain order and consensus in the disability program.

Senate Action On May 16, 1984, the Finance Committee approved S. 476.
Major provisions of the bill allowed disabled persons to continue collecting social security benefits if their medical condition had not improved since they were determined disabled.
476 and The major difference between the medical improvement provision in 3755 was that the Senate bill--but not the House bill--stated
that the recipient bore the burden of proof that his or her condition had not improved.

On May 22, 1984, Mr. Cohen (R-Maine), one of the sponsors of 476, said, "The need for fundamental change in the disability reviews has been evident for some time.
Since the reviews began, more than 12,000 individuals have filed court actions challeng ing the Social Security Administration's termination of their benefits.
An additional 40 class action suits had been filed The legislation before the Senate today as of last month . . . would end this chaos and insure an equitable review process."

Mr. Levin (D-Mich.), another sponsor, said, "It has taken us 3 years to come to grips with the problems in the disability re- view process as a legislative body.

P.L. 99-177, Public Debt Limit--Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (H.J. Res. 372)
/
The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, which was included as title 11 of H.J. Res. 372, increasing the national debt, was signed into law on December 12, 1985, by President Reagan.
The Act stipulates that budget
deficits must be decreased annually and requires under certain circumstances across-the-board cuts of non-exempt programs by a uniform percentage to achieve this result.
Under the Act, annual deficit amounts are established and, if
they are not met, a formula is used to reduce the level of Federal deficit annually until it reaches zero in FY 1991.
This part of P.L. 99-177 generally is referred to by the names of its sponsors--Senators Gramm (R-Tex.), Rudman (R-N.H.), and Hollings (D-S.C.).

P.L. 99-272 makes numerous changes in Federal programs to reduce the deficit in accordance with the budget decisions (S. Con. Res. 32) adopted by both the House and the Senate on August 1, 1985.
Among those changes are some minor and technical amendments to the Social Security program.

The HI trust fund is not affected (i.e., not separated from the budget until FY 1993).
In addition, the Act exempts social security benefits (including
cost-of-living adjustments) from automatic cuts and requires the Secretary of the Treasury to restore to the trust funds any interest lost as a result of 1984 and 1985 debt ceiling constraints, and to issue to the trust funds obli gations bearing interest rates and maturities identical to those of securities redeemed between August 31, 1985, and September 30, 1985.
