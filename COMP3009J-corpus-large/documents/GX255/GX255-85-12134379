Sample Phase II Trial Consent Form
A Phase II Trial of 9-A Minocamptothecin in Patients With Metastatic (D2), Androgen-Independent Prostate Carcinoma
This is a clinical trial (a type of research study).
Clinical trials only include patients who choose to take part.
Please take your time to make your decision.
Discuss it with your friends and family.
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland.
Why is This Study Being Done?
This research is being done because we do not know the best treatment for this kind of prostate cancer.
The purposes of this study are to: * Find out what effects (good and bad) the 9-aminocamptothecin (9-AC) has on prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland * See what effects 9-AC has on you and your cancer * Measure the amount of 9-AC in the blood to see how long it stays in your body pharmacokinetics)
How Many People Will Take Part in The Study?
About 40 people will take part in this study.
What is Involved in the Study?
Medical Tests:
This study involves the following tests.
Some of these tests would be done even if you do not take part in the study: * Blood tests * Urine tests * Physical exam * X-rays
Procedures:
In this study, you will receive 9-AC into a vein continuously for 5 days.
The 9-AC will be given through a pump connected to a catheter (a small, flexible tube) placed in a large vein in your chest (a minor surgical procedure).
This catheter is used to make it easier to give the drug continuously for 5 days without having to be in the hospital.
This is repeated 3 times over a 4-week period.
Each 4-week period is called a cycle.
The cycle will be repeated up to 6 times.
Of the tests and procedures listed, the use of 9-AC for metastatic prostate cancer is considered "experimental."
Of the tests and procedures listed, the following are commonly used but done only as part of the study:
+ Using the catheter for several months + Doing blood tests for research purposes to measure the amount of 9-AC in the blood
How Long Will I Be in the Study?
We think you will be in the study for 6 months depending on how you tolerate 9-AC and how well it controls your cancer.
The researcher may decide to take you off this study if any of the following occur:
+ Your blood counts drop too low + You have other serious bad effects + The cancer returns or grows
If at any time you decide to stop taking part in the study, you should talk to the researcher so that you can stop safely.
What Are the Risks of the Study?
While on the study, you are at risk for the following side effects.
Most of them are listed below but they will vary from person to person.
Drugs will be given to make some of the side effects less serious and uncomfortable.
Many side effects go away after the drug is stopped but, in some cases, the side effects may be serious and/or lasting.
Death is rare but possible.
Risks
Very likely:
* Decreased blood cell counts * Easy bleeding, especially from gums and nose * Fatigue * Shortness of breath * Fever and infection * Mouth sores * Diarrhea * Nausea and vomiting * Temporary hair loss
Less likely but serious:
Allergy causing any or all of these:
* low blood pressure * swelling of the throat * shortness of breath * hives and itching
There may be risks and side effects to you that we cannot predict.
Call the researcher and/or your regular doctor when you think you are having problems even if they are not on this list.
Reproductive risks: You should not father a baby while on the study.
Ask for more information about counseling and ways to prevent pregnancy.
For more information about risks and side effects, possible injuries, and treatment options, ask the researcher or contact _____________________________________.
Are There Benefits to Taking Part in the Study?
There may or may not be direct medical benefit to you for taking part in this study.
The reasonably expected benefit of the study is to gain knowledge about the effects of 9-AC on prostate cancer.
The information learned from this study may help future patients with prostate cancer.
What Other Options Are There?
Instead of being in this study, you have these options:
+ Radiation treatments + Treatment with other commonly-used chemotherapy + Other experimental therapy + No further anti-cancer therapy and comfort care only
Please talk to your regular doctor about these and other options
What About Confidentiality?
Efforts will be made to keep the personal information in your research record private and confidential but absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
Your personal information may be disclosed if required by law.
The following organizations may look at and/or copy your research records, for quality assurance and data analysis: * National Cancer Institute * Food and Drug Administration * Pharmacia and Upjohn, Inc.
(The companies that make 9-AC)
What Are the Costs?
If you get hurt or ill from this study, you will receive emergency medical treatment, but it will be charged in the regular way.
Long-term medical care and/or hospitalization will be charged at the usual rate.
No funds have been set aside to compensate you in the event of injury.
You will not be paid for taking part in this study.
Taking part in the research may result in added costs to you or your insurance company.
The drug 9-AC will be provided free of cost.

Sample Phase III Trial Consent Form
A Randomized Trial Evaluating the Worth of Taxol Following Doxorubicin (Adriamycin)/Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) in Breast Cancer
This is a clinical trial (a type of research study).
Clinical trials only include patients who choose to take part.
Please take your time to make your decision.
Discuss it with your friends and family.
You are being asked to take part in this research study because your breast cancer has spread to one or more of your underarm lymph nodes.
Why Is This Study Being Done?
The purpose of this research study is to find out whether adding the drug Taxol (paclitaxel) to a commonly-used chemotherapy is better than the commonly-used chemotherapy by itself at preventing your cancer from coming back.
The study also will see what side effects there are from adding Taxol to the commonly-used chemotherapy.
Taxol has been found to be effective in treating patients with advanced breast cancer.
In this study, we want to see whether Taxol will be a useful addition to the treatment of patients with early-stage breast cancer and to see whether the side effects seem to be worth the possible benefit.
How Many People Will Take Part in the Study?
About 2,450 people will take part in this study.
What is Involved in the Study?
Please refer to the diagram on page 8.
Medical tests:
The following tests must be done to make sure that you are eligible for this study.
None of these tests are experimental.
They are routine.
Depending on when you last had them, you may need to repeat some of these tests:
+ Mammogram + Blood tests + Chest x-ray + Gynecologic exam + Electrocardiogram + Bone scan + A special x-ray to study the heart (MUGA scan)
Many of the tests will also be repeated during the study.
If you participate in this study, some of these tests may be done more frequently than if you were not taking part in this research study.
Procedures (treatment):
If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will get two commonly-used chemotherapy drugs called Adriamycin (doxorubcin) and Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide).
These drugs will be given into your vein while you are in the doctor's office or clinic every 21 days for 4 visits.
The procedure will take about 2 hours.
The doses of the drugs may be changed if you have side effects.
You will not need to be hospitalized unless you have serious side effects.
If you are older than 50, you will also take tamoxifen pills daily for 5 years.
If you are younger than 50, you will get tamoxifen if your tumor has a positive estrogen or progesterone (ER/PR) hormone receptor test.
The Adriamycin and Cytoxan plus tamoxifen are usual treatments that would likely be given whether or not you are on this study.
Randomization (assignment to a group):
After completing the chemotherapy with Adriamycin and Cytoxan, you will be randomized to one of the study groups.
Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance.
It is like the flip of a coin, and assignment is done by a computer.
Neither you nor the researcher choose what group you will be in.
You will have an equal chance to be placed in either group.
Group 1: Does not get Taxol.
Group 2: Gets Taxol (by vein over 3 hours in the clinic or doctor's office every 21 days for 4 visits.)
How Long Will I Be in the Study?
Your chemotherapy will last 4 to 8 months and the tamoxifen therapy will last for 5 years.
Every 6 months you will come in for follow-up blood tests.
We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life to look at the long-term effects of the study.
The researchers can take you off the study early for reasons such as:
+ The treatment does not work in your cancer.
+ Your health gets worse.
+ You are unable to meet the requirements of the study (for example, you do not return for follow-up visits).
What Are the Risks of the Study?
While on the study, you are at risk for these side effects.
Most of them are listed in this form, but they will vary from person to person.
There may be other side effects that we cannot predict.
Other drugs will be given to make the side effects less serious and uncomfortable.
Many side effects go away shortly after the drugs are stopped, but in some cases, side effects may be serious and/or long-lasting or permanent.
Some may be life-threatening.
Talk with the researcher about this.
You may also want to talk to your regular doctor and/or read more about the drugs on the sheets attached to this form.
Reproductive risks: You should not become pregnant while on this study.
You should not nurse your baby while on this study.
Also, some of the drugs may cause sterility (make you unable to have children in the future).
Ask for more information if this applies to you.
Side effects of treatment:
Groups 1 and 2
Adriamycin and Cytoxan (commonly used chemotherapy)
Very likely:
* Lowered white blood count that may lead to an infection
(If you get an infection or your white blood count becomes very low, you will get daily shots of G-CSF (Neupogen).
G-CSF helps your white blood cells multiply to fight infections.
Some patients get pain in their bones with the G-CSF.)
* Lowered platelets count which may lead to an increase in bruising or bleeding
(If count gets too low, you may need platelet transfusions.)
* Lowered red blood cells count may cause anemia, tiredness, shortness of breath
(If count gets too low, you may need blood transfusions.)
* Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea * Complete hair loss * Skin and nail discoloration * Irregular or permanent stoppage of menstrual cycles * Mouth sores * Time away from work
Less likely:
* Blood in the urine * Heart damage (very rare at these doses) * Irregular heart beat (may occur right after drug is given) * Skin damage due to leakage of drug * Acute leukemia (very rare at these doses)
Tamoxifen (part of commonly used anticancer drug regimen):
While on Tamoxifen you should have an annual pelvic exam.
If you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic discomfort (pressure or pain), or other changes, report this to your regular doctor or the researcher as soon as possible.
These might be related to changes in the uterus.
Changes to the lining of the uterus can sometimes turn into a cancer of the uterus.
Very likely:
* Hot flashes * Vaginal dryness or discharge
Less likely:
* Eye problems, increased risk of developing cataracts (clouding of eye) * Uterine cancer * Ovarian cysts or endometriosis (spillage of uterine cells outside the uterus) * Blood clots (may be life-threatening) * Inflammation of the liver
Side effects of the study drug (Taxol):
Group 2 only
Taxol
Many of these side effects occur with Adriamycin and Cytoxan that you will already have received as part of the commonly-used chemotherapy.
This study will determine whether Taxol increases the severity of these side effects.
Also, three drugs will be given before the Taxol to control an allergic reaction that might occur.
These are:
* A steroid similar to cortisone (dexamethasone [Decadron])
(A brief, vaginal tingling sensation is possible when this drug is given.)
+ An antacid (metoclopramide [Reglan]) + An antihistamine (diphenhydramine [Benadryl]
Very likely:
* 
<
* Lowered red blood cells may lead to anemia, tiredness, or shortness of breath.
* Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea * Complete hair loss * Irregular menstrual cycles or permanent menstrual stoppage * Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes * Pain in muscles and joints
Less likely:
* Allergic reactions (may happen during injection) * Inflammation of pancreas and large bowel * Irregular heart beat * Inflammation of the liver
For more information about risks and side effects, ask the researcher or your regular doctor or contact _____________________________________________________.
Are There Benefits to Taking Part in the Study?
There may or may not be direct medical benefits to you from taking part in this study.
The expected benefit of taking part in the study is predicted to be similar to that of getting commonly-used chemotherapy without being in the study.
Although Taxol has been shown to be effective in women with advanced breast cancer, it is unknown whether the addition of Taxol to commonly-used chemotherapy will improve the outcome for women with less advanced breast cancer.
The information learned from this study should help future patients with breast cancer.
What Other Options Are There?
Instead of being in this study, you have these options:
+ Chemotherapy with Adriamycin and Cytoxan + Chemotherapy with other drugs that are as effective as Adriamycin and Cytoxan + Tamoxifen + No chemotherapy
Discuss these options with your regular doctor.
What About Confidentiality?
Efforts will be made to keep your personal information confidential.
We cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality.
Your personal information may be disclosed if required by law.
Organizations that may inspect and/or copy your research records for quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as:
+ The National Cancer Institute + The Food and Drug Administration + The National Surgical Adjuvant Project for Breast and Bowel Cancer + Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, which is providing the study drug Taxol without charge
What Are The Costs?
Taking part in this study may lead to added costs to you or your insurance company.
Please ask about any expected added costs or insurance problems.
In the case of injury or illness resulting from this study, emergency medical treatment is available but will be provided at the usual charge.
No funds have been set aside to compensate you in the event of injury.
You will be charged for continuing medical care and/or hospitalization at the usual rate.
You will receive no payment for taking part in this study.
You may be charged for the drugs other than Taxol that are used in this study.
The researcher will explain the policy at this institution.
What Are My Rights as a Participant?
Taking part in this study is voluntary.
Your decision about taking part in the study will not affect your medical care at this institution.
If you agree to take part and then decide against it, you can withdraw for any reason.
If you decide to stop taking part in the study, you should talk to the researcher so it can be done safely.
Leaving the study will not result in any penalty or lost benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
A Data Safety and Monitoring Board, an independent group of experts, will be reviewing the data from this research throughout the study.
We will tell you about new information from this board or other studies that may affect your health, welfare, or willingness to stay on this study.
