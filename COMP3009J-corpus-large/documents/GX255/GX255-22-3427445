TEXAS ANIMAL HEALTH COMMISSION CHAPTER 35.
BRUCELLOSIS SUBCHAPTER A. ERADICATION OF BRUCELLOSIS IN CATTLE 4 TAC Â§35.4 The Texas Animal Health Commission adopts amendments to Chapter 35 entitled, "Brucellosis."
Specifically, the adoption amends Â§35.4, related to Entry, Movement and Change of Ownership.
The purpose of this adoption is to remove an entry requirement for rodeo bulls coming to Texas in order to conform the state requirement to the federal standard recently adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture.
The amendment to Â§35.4 is adopted without changes to the proposed text as published in the December 27, 2002, issue of the Texas Register (27 TexReg 12125) and will not be republished.
On November 22, 2002, the United States Depar tment of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) adopted a final rule (Docket 01-095-2) that eliminated the annual brucellosis testing requirement for rodeo bulls moving interstate between Brucellosis Free States.
The commission has a requirement in Â§35.4 (b) (2) (C) that rodeo bulls coming to Texas need a brucellosis test.
In order to conform the state requirement to the federal standard, the commission is proposing to remove that requirement.
The commission would note that bulls from states not classified as Brucellosis Free (i.e., Missouri) would fall under the general requirement of needing to be tested.
No comments were received regarding adoption of the rule.
The amendment is adopted under the following statutory authority as found in Chapter 161 of the Texas Agriculture Code.
The commission is vested by statute, Section 161.041 (a), with the requirement to protect all livestock, domestic animals, and domestic fowl from disease.
The commission is authorized, by Section 161.041 (b), to act to eradicate or control any disease or agent of transmission for any disease that affects livestock.
If the commission determines that a disease listed in Section 161.041 of this code or an agent of transmission of one of those diseases exists in a place in this state among livestock, or that livestock are exposed to one of those diseases or an agent of transmission of one of those diseases, the commission shall establish a quarantine on the affected animals or on the affected place.
That is found in Section 161.061.
As a control measure, the commission by rule may regulate the movement of animals.
The commission may restrict the
intrastate movement of animals even though the movement of the animals is unrestricted in interstate or international commerce.
The commission may require testing, vaccination, or another epidemiologically sound procedure before or after animals are moved.
That is found in Section 161.054.
An agent of the commission is entitled to stop and inspect a shipment of animals or animal products being transpor ted in this state in order to determine if the shipment originated from a quarantined area or herd; or determine if the shipment presents a danger to the public health or livestock industry through insect infestation or through a communicable or noncommunicable disease.
That authority is found in Section 161.048.
Section 161.005 provides that the commission may authorize the executive director or another employee to sign written instruments on behalf of the commission.
A written instrument, including a quarantine or written notice signed under that authority, has the same force and effect as if signed by the entire commission.
Section 161.061 provides that if the commission determines that a disease listed in Section 161.041 of this code or an agency of transmission of one of those diseases exists in a place in this state or among livestock, exotic livestock, domestic animals, domestic fowl, or exotic fowl, or that a place in this state where livestock, exotic livestock, domestic animals, domestic fowl, or exotic fowl are exposed to one of those diseases or an agency of transmission of one of those diseases, the commission shall establish a quarantine on the affected animals or on the affected place.
This agency hereby cer tifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.

PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
The Texas Optometry Board adopts amendments to Â§277.6 without change to the proposed text published in the December 20, 2002, issue of the Texas Register (27 TexReg 11889).
The amendments set maximum administrative penalties for first time violations of specific sections of the Texas Optometr y Act and Rules.
The amendments also correct citations to the Act as codified in the Texas Occupations Code.
The Texas Optometry Board (agency) received comments from the National Association of Optometrists and Opticians (association).
The association commented that the statutes cited in the rule do not suppor t the amendment of the rule, and that the Texas Optometry Act prohibits a retailer, wholesaler or manufacturer of ophthalmic goods from ". . . exercising undue control over an optometrist's professional judgment or manner of practice."
The agency disagrees with this comment.
Section 351.408(a) of the Optometry Act actually reads: "[t]his section . . . shall be liberally construed to prevent manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of ophthalmic goods from controlling or attempting to control the professional judgment, manner of practice, or practice of an optometrist or therapeutic optometrist."
The word "undue" is not par t of the statute, and nowhere in the statue is the effect of the statute limited to this restriction as proposed by the association.
Such a proposed limitation would be directly contradicted by the "liberally construed" pronouncement in subsection (a).
The association also commented that the Optometr y Act does not prohibit opticians from making appointments for optometrists, optometrists from sharing appointment information with an optical on the availability of appointments, or opticals from providing "such information" to its customers in response to inquiries about the practice of an optometrist.
The agency disagrees with this comment.
Section 351.408(b) of the Optometry Act states "[i]n this section, [']
(4) providing, hiring, or sharing employees, business services, or similar items to or with an optometrist or therapeutic optometrist; . . ."
This subsection, as well as subsection (a) quoted above, prohibit the activities set out in the proposed language of subsection (d)(2)(A).
The association also commented that the proposed rule would prohibit manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of ophthalmic goods from adver tising to optometrists the availability of space to lease for professional practice.
The agency disagrees with this comment.
The proposed amendment is not intended to prohibit such activity, but instead prohibits manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of ophthalmic goods from providing or sharing business services with an optometrist.
The association also commented that the proposed rule would prohibit manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of ophthalmic goods from adver tising to the public that an " . . . optometric practice [is] located adjacent to or near the optical premises."

CONTINUING EDUCATION
The Texas Optometry Board adopts amendments to Â§275.1, concerning General Requirements without change to the proposed text published in the December 20, 2002, issue of the Texas Register (27 TexReg 11888).
The amendments bring the rule into compliance with earlier amendments to Â§275.2 (27 TexReg 2237), which combined the continuing education credit hours limitation on on-line and correspondence courses so that a license may receive eight credit hours for any combination of the courses.
The amendments will also correct the legal citations to the Texas Optometr y Act, and references to the correct name for the national cer tifying organization, the Association of Regulatory Boards of Optometry.
No comments were received regarding the amendments.
The amendments are adopted under the Texas Optometry Act, Texas Occupations Code, Â§351.151 and Â§351.308.
The Texas Optometr y Board interprets Â§351.151 as authorizing the adoption of procedural and substantive rules for the regulation of the optometric profession.
The Board interprets Â§351.308 as setting the requirements for continuing education.
This agency hereby cer tifies that the adoption has been reviewed by legal counsel and found to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.

The agency disagrees with this comment.
The proposed amendment is not intended to prohibit the use of a phrase in adver tising by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of ophthalmic goods that as a factual matter an independent optometrist is located next to the optical or at another location convenient to the premises of the optical.
The association also commented that the Optometry Act does not prohibit optometrists from voluntarily agreeing to maintain minimum office hours, since such an agreement is ". . . not indicative of undue control or influence."
The agency disagrees with this comment.
Again, neither the word "undue" or any similar word is contained in Â§351.408 to limit the scope of the prohibition on controlling or attempting to control an optometrist's manner of practice or practice.
The proposed rule language of "[d]irecting or allowing optical employees or owners to set the practice hours . . ." is authorized by the specific language of Â§351.408(b): "[i]

The amendments are adopted under the Texas Optometry Act, Texas Occupations Code, Â§Â§351.151, 351.551 and 351.552.
The Texas Optometry Board interprets Â§351.151 as authorizing the adoption of procedural and substantive rules for the regulation of the optometric profession.
The Board interprets Â§351.551 and Â§351.552 as authorizing the imposition of administrative penalties by the Board according to provisions set out in the Act.
The only other sections affected by the amendments are Â§351.351 (address changes); Â§351.362 (display of name); Â§351.203 (public interest information); Â§351.155 and Â§351.403 (adver tising restrictions); Â§351.404 (offering glasses or contacts as a prize); and Â§Â§351.408, 351.459, 351.363 and 351.364 (prohibiting control of optometry by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of ophthalmic goods, and requiring complete separation between dispensing opticians and optometrists).

30 TAC Â§305.48 The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (commission) adopts the amendment to Â§305.48 with change to the proposed text as published in the December 6, 2002 issue of the Texas Register (27 TexReg 11479).
The primary purpose of the amendment is to revise the commission rules to incorporate by reference United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations relating to cooling water intake structures.
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE ADOPTED RULE On September 14, 1998, the State of Texas was authorized by EPA to administer and enforce the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program for regulating discharges of pollutants into waters of the state under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, 33 United States Code, Â§Â§1251 et seq. (commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act).
The approved state program, i.e., the Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) program, published September 24, 1998 in the Federal Register (63 FR 51164), is administered by the commission.
The changes in this chapter, necessitated by EPA changes to its regulations, are par t of an effor t by the commission to revise several chapters of its rules to maintain equivalency with EPA's regulations and thereby to maintain delegated NPDES permitting authority.
Section 305.48 is amended to correct the name for Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and to require that permit applicants also submit Nor th American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.
SECTION DISCUSSION Subchapter C, Application for Permit.
Section 305.48, Additional Contents of Applications for Wastewater Discharge Permits, is amended to incorporate new requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Â§122.21(r), which requires all owners or operators of new facilities subject to regulations addressing cooling water intake structures to submit three general categories of information when they apply for a TPDES permit.
The general categories of information include: 1) physical data to characterize the source water body in the vicinity where the cooling water intake structures are located; 2) data to characterize the design and operation of the cooling water intake structures; and 3) existing data (if available) to characterize the baseline biological condition of the source waterbody.
40 CFR Â§122.21 is not the exclusive list of information applicants must submit if the new cooling water intake structure rules are applicable.
40 CFR Par t 125, Subchapter I, Requirements Applicable to Cooling Water Intake Structures for New Facilities Under Section 316(b) of the Act, also contains permit application information that must be provided when submitting a TPDES permit application.
These requirements are incorporated by reference in 30 TAC Â§308.91 as a concurrent rulemaking published in this issue of the Texas Register.
Section 305.48 is amended to correct the name for SIC codes and to update the rules to require submission of up to four NAICS codes.
The previous rule language incorrectly stated that the acronym "SIC" stands for standard industrial codes.
Also, a requirement for permit applicants to provide up to four NAICS codes has been added because this system has replaced SIC codes.
NAICS is an industr y classification system that groups establishments into industries based on the activities in which

they are primarily engaged.
However, existing federal rules applicable to wastewater permitting applications and categorical effluent guidelines reference SIC codes.
Therefore, the rules are amended to require applicants for a wastewater permit to provide SIC and NAICS code information.
It is anticipated that, once SIC codes are phased out and regulations and guidance documents include NAICS code references, the rule may be revised to delete the requirement for submitting SIC codes.
A typographical error in a citation in Â§305.48(b)(2) is also corrected.
FINAL REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS DETERMINATION The commission reviewed the adopted rulemaking in light of the regulatory analysis requirements of the Texas Government Code, Â§2001.0225, and determined that the rulemaking is not subject to Â§2001.0225 because it does not meet the criteria for a "major environmental rule" as identified in that statute.
A major environmental rule means a rule, the specific intent of which, is to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure and that may adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, or the environment or public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.
The rulemaking will not adversely affect, in a material way, the economy, a section of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.
The amendment updates the commission's consolidated permits rules to incorporate cer tain federal regulations regarding NPDES permitting requirements.
The adopted amendment additionally does not require regulatory analysis under Texas Government Code, Â§2001.0225 because Â§2001.0225 only applies to a major environmental rule, the result of which is to: 1) exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically required by state law; 2) exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is specifically required by federal law; 3) exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or contract between the state and an agency or representative of the federal government to implement a state and federal program; or 4) adopt a rule solely under the general powers of the agency instead of under a specific state law.
The adopted amendment does not introduce additional regulator y requirements that are not currently enforced by the EPA.
Therefore, the commission concludes that a regulatory analysis is not required in this instance because the rule does not meet any of the four criteria in Texas Government Code, Â§2001.0225.
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT The commission performed an assessment of these rules in accordance with Texas Government Code, Â§2007.043.
The specific purpose of the adopted rulemaking is to ensure that the commission's consolidated permits requirements are equivalent to EPA's NPDES permitting regulations.
The rule will substantially advance this stated purpose by adopting language intended to ensure that state rules are equivalent to the corresponding federal regulations.
The commission's assessment indicates that Texas Government Code, Chapter 2007 does not apply to this rulemaking because this is an action that does not adversely affect real proper ty and also is within the exceptions of Chapter 2007 because it is reasonably taken to fulfill an obligation mandated by federal law.
CONSISTENCY WITH THE COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
The commission reviewed the rulemaking and found that it is subject to Coastal Coordination Act Implementation Rules under 31 TAC Â§505.11(b)(4) because it involves a rule governing a specifically listed individual commission action (issuance or approval) that may affect a coastal natural resource area.
Therefore, the rulemaking must be consistent with applicable goals and policies of the Texas Coastal Management Program (CMP).
The commission prepared a consistency determination for the rules under 31 TAC Â§505.22 and found the rulemaking is consistent with the applicable CMP goals and policies.
CMP goals applicable to the amendment include 31 TAC Â§501.12(5), concerning balance of the benefits from economic development and multiple human uses of the coastal zone and benefits from protecting, preserving, restoring, and enhancing coastal natural resource areas; Â§501.14(a)(1)(B), concerning electric generating facilities using once-through cooling systems to be located and designed to have the least adverse effects practicable, including impingement or entrainment of estuarine organisms; and Â§501.14(r)(1)A)(vi), concerning commission administration of the law so as to promote the judicious use and maximum conservation and protection of the quality of the environment and the natural resources of the state.
The rulemaking incorporates by reference federal requirements to prevent the entrainment of aquatic or marine organisms with cooling water at new facilities that uptake at least two million gallons per day of water (with at least 25% of the total water used for cooling purposes).
The rulemaking applies statewide, including the coastal areas.
PUBLIC COMMENT The public comment period ended on Januar y 6, 2003.
No comments were received during the comment period.
STATUTORY AUTHORITY The amendment is adopted under Texas Water Code (TWC), Â§5.102, which grants the commission the authority to carr y out its powers under the TWC; Â§5.103, which provides the commission authority to adopt any rules necessar y to carry out its powers and duties under this code and other laws of this state; Â§5.105, which requires the commission to establish and approve all general policy of the commission by rule; and Â§5.120, which requires the commission to administer the law for the maximum conservation and protection of the environment and natural resources of the state.

CRITERIA AND STANDARDS FOR THE NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM SUBCHAPTER I. CRITERIA APPLICABLE TO COOLING WATER INTAKE STRUCTURES UNDER CLEAN WATER ACT, Â§316(b) 30 TAC Â§308.91 The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (commission) adopts new Â§308.91 with change to the proposed text as published in the December 6, 2002 issue of the Texas Register (27 TexReg 11482).
The primary purpose of the new section is to incorporate by reference United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations relating to cooling water intake structures in the commission rule which corresponds to those federal regulations.
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE ADOPTED RULE On September 14, 1998, the State of Texas was authorized by EPA to administer and enforce the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program for regulating discharges of pollutants into waters of the state under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, 33 United States Code, Â§Â§1251 et seq. (commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act).
The approved state program, i.e., the Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) program, published September 24, 1998 in the Federal Register (63 FR 51164), is administered by the commission.
The changes in this chapter, necessitated by EPA changes to federal regulations, are par t of an effor t by the commission to revise several chapters of its rules to maintain equivalency with EPA's regulations and thereby to maintain delegated NPDES permitting authority.
SECTION DISCUSSION New Â§308.91, Criteria Applicable to Cooling Water Intake Structures under the Clean Water Act, Â§316(b), incorporates language contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Â§Â§125.80 125.89.
The EPA rule implemented the Clean Water Act, Â§316(b) for new facilities that use water withdrawn from rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, oceans, or other waters of the United States for cooling purposes.
The national requirements establish the best technology available, based on a two-track approach, for minimizing adverse environmental impact associated with the use of these structures.
Track I establishes national velocity intake capacity and velocity requirements based on size, as well as location- and capacity-based requirements to reduce intake flow below cer tain propor tions of cer tain waterbodies.
For fresh water rivers and streams, intake flow must be less than or equal to 5% of the mean annual flow; for lakes and reservoirs, intake flow may not disrupt natural thermal stratification or turnover pattern (where present) of the source water except in cases where the disruption is determined to be beneficial to the management

of fisheries for fish and shellfish by any fishery management agency; for estuaries or tidal rivers, intake flow must be less than or equal to 1% of the tidal excursion volume; for oceans, there are no propor tional flow requirements.
Track I also requires the permit applicant to select and implement design and construction technologies under cer tain conditions to minimize impingement mor tality and entrainment.
Track II allows permit applicants to conduct site-specific studies to demonstrate to the commission that alternatives to the Track I requirements will reduce impingement mor tality and entrainment for all life stages of fish and shellfish to a level of reduction comparable to the level the facility would achieve at the cooling water intake structure if it met the Track I requirements.
This rule applies to new greenfield facilities and stand-alone facilities that use cooling water intake structures to withdraw water from waters of the United States and that have or require a TPDES permit issued under the Clean Water Act, Â§402.
Greenfield facilities are facilities that are constructed at a site at which no other source is located, or that totally replace the process or production equipment at an existing facility (see 40 CFR Â§122.29(b)(1)(i)).
Stand-alone facilities are new, separate facilities that are constructed on proper ty where an existing facility is located and with processes that are substantially independent of the existing facility at the same site (see 40 CFR Â§122.29(b)(1)(iii)).
New facilities subject to this regulation include those that have a design intake flow of greater than two million gallons per day and that use at least 25% of the withdrawn water for cooling purposes.
Specifically, the new rule applies to owners or operators of any facility that meets all of the following: the greenfield or stand-alone facility meets the definition of a new facility specified in 40 CFR Â§125.83; the new facility uses a newly constructed or modified existing intake structure or structures, or the facility obtains cooling water by any sor t of contract or arrangement with an independent supplier that has a cooling water intake structure; the new facility's cooling water intake structure(s) withdraw(s) water from waters of the United States and at least 25% of the water withdrawn is used for contact or non-contact cooling purposes; the new facility has a design flow of greater than two million gallons per day; the new facility has an NPDES permit or is required to obtain one.
Use of cooling water does not include obtaining cooling water from a public water system or the use of treated effluent that otherwise would be discharged to a water of the United States.
This provision is intended to prevent circumvention of these requirements by creating arrangements to receive cooling water from an entity that is not itself a point source.
Changes to a cooling water intake structure are considered modifications for purposes of the rule only if such changes result in an increase in design capacity.
Generally, facilities that meet these criteria fall into two major groups: new steam electric generating facilities and new manufacturing facilities.
The rule does not apply to existing facilities including major modifications to existing facilities that may be "new sources" in 40 CFR Â§122.29 as that term is used in the EPA's effluent guidelines and standards program.
FINAL REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS DETERMINATION The commission reviewed the adopted rulemaking in light of the regulatory analysis requirements of Texas Government Code, Â§2001.0225, and determined that the rulemaking is not subject to Â§2001.0225 because it does not meet the criteria for a "major environmental rule" as set out in that statute.
A major environmental rule means a rule, the specific intent of which, is to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from
environmental exposure and that may adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, or the environment or public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.
The adoption will not adversely affect, in a material way, the economy, a section of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.
The new section additionally does not require regulatory analysis under Texas Government Code, Â§2001.0225 because Â§2001.0225 only applies to a major environmental rule, the result of which is to: 1) exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically required by state law; 2) exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is specifically required by federal law; 3) exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or contract between the state and an agency or representative of the federal government to implement a state and federal program; or 4) adopt a rule solely under the general powers of the agency instead of under a specific state law.
The new section does not introduce additional regulatory requirements that are not currently enforced by the EPA or the commission.
Therefore, the commission concludes that a regulatory analysis is not required in this instance because the adopted rule does not meet any of the four criteria in Texas Government Code, Â§2001.0225.
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT The commission performed an assessment of the adopted rule in accordance with Texas Government Code, Â§2007.043.
The specific purpose of the rulemaking is to ensure that the commission's requirements for permits are equivalent to EPA's NPDES permitting regulations.
The rule will substantially advance this stated purpose by adopting language intended to ensure that state rules are equivalent to the corresponding federal regulations.
The commission's assessment indicates that Texas Government Code, Chapter 2007 does not apply to this adopted rulemaking because this is an action that does not adversely affect real proper ty and also is within the exceptions of Chapter 2007 because it is reasonably taken to fulfill an obligation mandated by federal law.
CONSISTENCY WITH THE COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The commission reviewed the adopted rulemaking and found that it is rulemaking subject to Coastal Coordination Act Implementation Rules under 31 TAC Â§505.11(b)(4) because it involves a rule governing a specifically listed individual commission action (issuance or approval) that may affect a coastal natural resource area.
Therefore, the rulemaking must be consistent with applicable goals and policies of the Texas Coastal Management Program (CMP).
The commission prepared a consistency determination for the rules under 31 TAC Â§505.22 and found the rulemaking is consistent with the applicable CMP goals and policies.
CMP goals applicable to the adopted rule include 31 TAC Â§501.12(5), concerning balance of the benefits from economic development and multiple human uses of the coastal zone and benefits from protecting, preserving, restoring, and enhancing coastal natural resource areas; Â§501.14(a)(1)(B), concerning electric generating facilities using once-through cooling systems to be located and designed to have the least adverse effects practicable, including impingement or entrainment of estuarine organisms; and Â§501.14(r)(1)(A)(vi), concerning commission administration of the law so as to promote the judicious use

and maximum conservation and protection of the quality of the environment and the natural resources of the state.
The rulemaking incorporates by reference federal requirements to prevent the entrainment of aquatic or marine organisms with cooling water at new facilities that uptake at least two million gallons per day of water (with at least 25% of the total water used for cooling pur poses).
The rulemaking applies statewide, including the coastal areas.
