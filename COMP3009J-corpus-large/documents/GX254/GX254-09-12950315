CHEFFER2
Th ank you, Co lonel Lederer, both fo r the introduction an d for th e opportunity to address such a distinguished audience of military lawyers, faculty, and other guests.
I also want to thank Brigadier General Thomas Romig for his hospitality and encouragement to be here today.
Lieutenant Colonel Tia Johnson, the Chair of your International and Operational Law Department, merits special praise for her hard work to bring me here for the Solf Lecture.
One of the most dynamic fields of international law today is the law of a rm ed conf li ct , or wha t is increa singly r efer red to as intern ational humanitarian law and internatio nal crimin al law in multilateral negotiations and in scholarly treatises.
As JAG officers, you above all others recognize the importance of the U.S. military's role in developing the law of armed conflict and in complying with it.
We are all guided by a remark1.
This article is an edited transcript of a lecture delivered on 28 February 2001 by David J. Scheffer to members of the staff and faculty, distinguished guests, and officers attending the 49th Judge Advocate Officer Graduate Course at The Judge Advocate General's School, U.S. Army, Charlottesville, Virginia.
The Waldemar A. Solf Lecture in International Law was established at The Judge Advocate General's School on 8 October 1982.
The chair was named after Colonel Solf who served in increasingly important positions during his career as a judge advocate.
After his retirement, he lectured at American University for two years, then served as Chief of the International A ffairs Division, Office of The Judge Advocate General.
In that position, he represented the United States at num erous international conferences including those that prepared the 1977 Protocols Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
After his successful effort in completing the Protocol negotiations, he returned to Washington and was appointed the Special Assistant to The Judge Advocate G eneral for Law of War Matters.
He served in that position until his second retirement in August 1979.

ab ly r i ch tr ad ition of Am e ric an e nga ge me nt in the de ve lopm en t a n d enforcement of the law of armed conflict.
Well-trained forces that understand the law of armed conflict will demonstrate professionalism and compliance that cannot be seriously questioned.
The law yers who train and deploy and fight with our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are a vital line of defense.
Judge advo cates must know, with precision , the law of armed conflict, and they must protect their commanders throughout the cycle of operations and in any operational environment.
That is a very tough job for w hich I believe you deserve our respect and our full support in every possible way.
I have always told your superiors to sign me up for any testimony before Congress to increase your salaries and benefits.
Believe me, it is a humbling experience for this lawyer to stand before so many professional military lawyers who shoulder so much responsibility.
During my tour as Ambassador-at-Large, we drew upon your profession's heritage daily as we supported the work of the International Criminal Tribunals f or the Fo r me r Yugoslavia and Rw a nda, negotiated the establishment of the Extraordinary Chambers in Cambodia and the Indepen dent Special C ourt fo r S ierra L eon e, an d ass is ted w ith estab lis hin g credible mechanisms of justice to respond to atrocities in East Timor, Sri La nk a, th e Great Lakes region of Afri ca, Kosovo, Iraq, and other war zones.
I am proud to have had JA G officers work for me in the Office of War Crimes Issues in the State Department and on the U.S. delegation to 2.
Former Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues.
David John Scheffer was nominated by President William J. Clinton to serve as the first-ever Ambassador-at-Large for War Crim es Issues on 22 May 1997.
Following Senate confirmation, he was sworn into office on 5 August 1997.
The appointment carried an ambassadorial rank.
This newly created post addresses serious violations of international humanitarian law anywhere in the world.
Ambassador Scheffer coordinated support for the functions of the Yugoslav and Rwandan War Crimes Tribunals, headed the Atrocities Prevention Inter-Agency Working Group, and led U.S. participation in United Nations negotiations for the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court.
He also coordinated U.S. efforts to establish international records and mechanisms of accountability for past or on-going violations of internationa l hum anitarian law in conflict a reas, and assisted S ecretary of State Madeleine A lbri ght in ad dr ess ing th e n ee ds of vi ctim s of su ch atr oci ties .
Am b ass ado r Sch effer reported directly to Secretary Albright.
During the first term of the Clinton Ad ministration, Ambassador Scheffer was Senior Advisor and Counsel to then-Ambassador Albright.
His duties included war crimes issues and national security and peacekeeping policies.
He also se rv ed a s t he Wa sh in gt on re pr es en tat ive f or th e U ni ted S ta te s M iss ion to th e U nit ed Nations, as a member of the Deputies Committee of the National Security Council, and as the Alternative Representative on the United States delegation to the United Nations talks on the proposal for a permanent International Criminal Court.

the ICC talks.
One of them, Lieutenant Colonel Michael New ton of the U.S. Army, a former instructor here, joins us today.
My subject toda y is the pe rma ne nt I nter na tional Crim in al C ourt, which does not yet exist but will, within probably a few years, and thus will deeply influence much of your work as judge advocates.
In approaching this opportunity, I struggled with a more classic legal analysis of the Rome Treaty regime that will govern the International Criminal Court and some general proposit ions that speak t o t he pu rpo se and consequ ences of th e Court.
While I will emphasize some key legal points today, I also want to elevate your own thinking about this issue to its larger context in international politics and international security.
I spoke publicly often about the ICC as head of the U.S. delegation to th e U n ited N ati on s talk s o n th e Cou rt from 1 99 7 un ti l last mon th , an d before then as deputy head of the delegatio n.You can access most of my remarks that are on the public record and in the State Department's Web site,3 now under "Archives," probably to the satisfaction of some of my critics on the right.
Since I had droves of critics on the left as well through the years, you can appreciate that I sometimes considered myself a lone warrio r on th is s ub ject: so meon e wh o w alk ed a fin e lin e bet ween ou r deeply held concerns about the impact the ICC may have on American service members and our firm resolve to lead in the application of international justice and the enforcement of the laws of war.
Building, achieving, and then advancing an inter-agency consensus on ICC issues w ere tasks that consumed a significant portion of my job.
It became common practice that I devoted far more time debating and achieving consensus within our own gov ernment, even w hile intern ation al negotiations were underw ay, than was required of any of our foreign negotiators.
There was no agency I listened to more carefully, and represented under the most difficult negotiating circumstances, than the Department of Defense, including therein the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Judge advocates and Defense lawyers populated my delegation; indeed no other delegation included so many military counsels as did the U.S. delegation.
They made critical contributions and protected U.S. military interests every step of the way.

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court w as finalized on July 17, 1998.
4 The treaty embodying the Rome Statute will enter into force when sixty states have ratified it, and I will henceforth refer to it as th e Ro me Treaty.
On e h u nd red and t hi rty -n in e s tat es hav e s ig n ed t h e Rome Treaty; of those, twenty-nine have ratified it.
The ratifiers are our allies and friends, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Norway, Canada, Finland, Ghana, Iceland, Austria, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Many other states are moving towards ratification, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Chile, and Australia.
Russia signed the Rome Treaty last September.
The United States signed the Rome Treaty on December 31, 2000, the last possible day the treaty permitted signature, after which any non-signatory state would have to accede to the treaty.
Iran and Israel also signed the treaty on December 31st.
The significant states that did not sign the Rome Treaty are Japan, China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, E th iopia, and Saudi Arabia, an d such outcast states as Iraq, N orth Korea, Cuba, Libya, Myanmar (or Burma), and Afghanistan.
The U.S. decision to sign the Rome Treaty was and remains controversial.
I strongly believe that President Clinton's decision was the right one.
That may come as a surprise to those who followed my public statements and negotiating positions since 1995, because I often articulated the Clinton Administration's serious concerns about flaws in the Rome Treaty, particularly the flaw that military and civilian personnel of a non-party to the treaty could be ensnared by the Court's jurisdiction w ithout the nonparty's consent.
But we worked that problem very hard during the negotiatio ns o ver the Rul es fo r Pro ced ure and E vid ence and t he Elemen ts o f Crimes, which w ere adopted by consensus at the Preparatory Commission on the ICC last June, and we continued to work it at the N ovember-December 2000 session of the Preparatory Commission.
Anyone w ho analyzes the Rome Treaty w ithout also examining the Rules an d E lement s w ill reach flawed conclusio ns ab out the man ner in which the IC C w i ll be gove rn e d .
Th at is why I spea k of the " t re at y regime," meaning the Rome Statute, the Rules, the Elements, and the other supplemental documents that are now being negotiated in the Preparatory Commission in New York.
Still on deck in New York are the Relationship Agreement between the United Nations and the ICC, privileges and immu4.

nities for the Court, financial regulations and rules, the headquarters agreement between the Court and The Netherlands, the all-important rules of procedure of the Assembly of States Parties, and the trigger, definition, and elements for the crime of aggression.
All of these supplemental documents cont ai n critical pro vis ion s of direct rel ev ance an d op po rt uni ty for U.S. interests, and they all offer the chance to enhance the overall effectiveness and universal acceptability of the ICC.
We ignore them at our own risk.
The dilemma we had to wrestle with late last year was whether w e best confronted the treaty's remaining flaws, and I emphasize "remaining" subsequent to our work in the Rules and Elements negotiations, as a signatory working the issues hard from within the ten t, or as a no n-signato ry protesting the Court's legitimacy.
Knowing full well that the U nited States has a signifi can t im pa ct when e ngaged in such negotiati ons, I reco mmended signature and other senior officials joined me in that recommendation.
Other views pointed towards non-signature as the preferred policy decision.
The President deliberated with a full set of views and recommendations, and a lot of tough questions w ere asked.
In fact, the difficulties and ris ks of t he Ro me Treat y w ere emp has ized and d escrib ed in great detail to him.
Well-meaning patriots, including some members of Congress, appear determined to derail the Rome Treaty.
That would be folly.
Declaring war on t he treat y or jus t mon ito ri ng furth er talk s w ith s tud ied in differen ce, whic h appears to be th e Bu sh Admi nistration's chosen course fo r the present, w ould undermine U.S. interests.
As a signatory, the United States now is well armed to improve the treaty regime and advance our commitment to international justice.
In the Clinton Administration we negotiated this controversial treaty, as well as the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and Elements of Crimes that we insisted be added to it, for worthwhile objectives.
America's advocacy of the rule of law abroad as well as at home needs backbone, and a p erm an en t c o u rt t ha t w e le ad i n s h ap i n g w i ll a d v an ce ju s t i ce.
I n t h e twenty-first century, perpetrators of heinous crimes like genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes must be prosecuted and punished.
We proudly stand for that proposition as a nation born out of the struggle for freedom, for democracy, and for a rule of law that protects and does not trample the legitimate rights of all humankind.
Cynics overseas, and some at home, argue that this will be victor 's justice alone, just as, they argue, the International Criminal Tribunals for

the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda have been conceived.
They overlook, of course, that the Yugoslav Tribunal was established long before the Dayton Accords, which could hardly be described as a traditional victory in war for any side of the Balkans conflict, and that defendants from all sides of that conflict have and will continue to stand trial.
The R wanda Tribunal has nothing to do with victory or defeat--just internal mass slaughter, and the Prosecutor has publicly made it clear that she is investigating Tutsi officials suspected of crimes in 1994.
So me critics, particu larly at home, seek on ly victor 's justice in ou r own image in the pursuit of international justice, and they view the ICC as a threat to that proposition.
But we must be engaged constructively with the Court to ensure that international justice coexists compatibly with the requirements of international peace and security and our own self-defense an d t hat o f ou r al li ance part n ers an d frien d s. Fear o f pro s ecut io n can become a self-fulfilling prophecy if we are shortsighted enough to let that fear intimidate and then conquer us.
In this struggle for the law, we will prevail if we demonstrate the w ill to persevere through all of the detailed negotiations and all of the political maneuvering that is associated with any treaty negotiation.
My advice is blunt: Get over it.
The world is changing.
The Internation al C r im ina l C our t wi ll b e e s ta bli s he d, soon .
We h av e to d ec i d e whether we stand for the rule of law or squirm in the face of it.
If we cannot stand for the proposition that heinous crimes against humankind will be answ ered an d build the institu tions to do th at job in a very complex world, then our leadership in promoting the rule of law abroad will decline rapidly and the value of our own principles will erode.
Others will take the lead.
The United States must have the courage to embrace change if it presumes to retain the mantle of leadership.
The last decade was the beginning o f an age of accountab ility that the United States must continue to lead, both in the interests of humanity and to ensure that justice is rendered fairly and globally in a manner that advances U.S. interests.

deterrence--problematic ev en in d omestic law enforcement--can not b e disproved.
Let me emphasize that our remaining legal objections to the International Criminal Court were not overcome or cast aside with U.S. signature.
President Clinto n made that clear in h is D ecemb er 3 1st st atement.5 But those objections never dictated non-signature either.
The first objection is the presumption, embodied in Article 12 of the Rome Treaty, that official personnel of a non-party state can be investigated and prosecuted by the Court provided either the state where the crime occurred or the state o f nationality of the perpetrator is already party to the Rome Treaty or, as a non-party, con sents to ICC ju risdiction .
We based our objection on ou r interpretation of customary international law, namely that it does not yet entitle a state, whether as a party or as a non-party to the Rome Treaty, to delegate to an international criminal court its own domestic authority to bring to justice individuals who commit crimes on its sovereign territory, without the consent of that individual's state of nationality either through ratification of the Rome Treaty or by special consent.6 However, we made it crystal clear in the negotiations, and I hope we continue to make it clear, that as a practical matter the United States is prepared to examine circumstances where individuals can be prosecuted before the International Criminal Court without either requ irement--ratification or special consent-- having been first obtained.
We sought to negotiate some of those circumstances and in effect violate our own rule of interpretation so as to create a realistic and effective mechanism for international justice.
We otherwise had a very tough sell, because we would have had to argue for the rights of all manner of nonparty states when most of our negotiating partners were signatory states that either had already ratified the Rome Treaty or were moving towards ratification.
Imag in e yourself in the sh oes of one of our staunch NATO allies an d su pporters of the Rome Treaty, lis tenin g to an argument that, while it would benefit the United States military, also would immunize an aggressor state's military personnel from any action by the International Criminal Court.
The objective of our allies is to promote ratification, not insulate non-party states.
The simple negotiating reality is that it was not plausible to argue that a non-party state whose military forces are respon5.

sible fo r he inous c rim e s c ould a void the Co u rt a b se nt a C h ap te r VI I enforcement referral by the U.N. Security Council, a body in disfavor with many of the governments in the negotiating room, including some of our closest allies.
The methodologies we examined with other governments were creative, realistic, and relevant for the real culprits.
We proposed provisions that focused only on the status of official personnel before the Court, without seeking any particular protection for other individuals, such as mercenaries, rebels, or other non-official combatants.
We sought to distinguish between the "good guys" and the "bad guys" of non-party states thrashing about in the cauldron of international security challenges that define modern warfare and human right s.Although we had the reality of the international system and sheer logic on our side in these debates, we could not prevail last year with a formula that would achieve consensus among so many disparate governments engaged in the negotiations.
A fter all, each government had to ask itself whether it was one of the good guys, or one of the bad guys.
Despite th e difficulty of su stainin g o ur interp retatio n o f cu stomary international law, ev en with pragmatically drawn exceptions, we helped negotiate Rule 44(2) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, the importance of which is often overlooked.
One of our primary concerns about the jurisdiction of the Court has been its preconditions to jurisdiction set forth in Article 12, that conceivably could permit Iraq, as a non-party, to trigger the Court's jurisdiction over U.S. pilots engaged in defensive actions in the skies over Iraq without requiring the Court to scrutinize Iraq's conduct as well.
Rule 44(2) addresses that problem and requires that any declaration by a non-party state triggering the Court's jurisdiction under Article 12 has the consequence of accepting the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to all of the crimes covered by the Rome Treaty that are relevant to the situatio n, a term used elsew here in th e treat y to mean th e o verall con flict.
Thus, Iraq would have to invite the Court's scrutiny of its own illegal conduct, which is massive, in order to trigger investigation of the U.S. pilots.
In its own self-interest, Iraq w ould avoid that opportunity.
On the larger issue of overall protection for the U.S. military, however, we finally had to face the fact that we were barking up the wrong tree, and o ur mili tary services w ere no t bein g w ell-served w ith los ing arg uments.
I spent many years seeking full immunity for our military forces and their civilian leadership in negotiations that quite frankly sometimes seemed the theater of the absurd.
I was given nothing to offer--certainly

not signature or ratification--in return for an absolutist carve-out that other governments, particularly our closest allies, found arrogant and hypocritical.
I finally successfully lobbied my colleagues in Washington to permit me to offer a "good neighbor" pledge towards the Court in return for full protection.
Si nce th e next ad m i nistration could re vers e th a t politic al pledge, how ever, it proved unconvincing.
We constantly focused on the extreme circumstance where the International Court could theoretically pursue an American soldier even if the United States has not yet become a party to the treaty.
In the eight years of my d elib eratio ns i n Was hin gt on o n t he Int ern atio nal C ri min al Cou rt-- beginning with the work of the International Law Commission in 1993 and 1994--I do not recall hearing any senior Defense D epartment official refer to the core purpose of the Court, namely to advance international justice and enforce the law of armed conflict.
Every single discussion was dominated by how th e Cou rt wo uld impact th e U nited St ates military.
Fai r enoug h; it was ou r du ty as public servants to put that concern front and center, and we did year after year.
I am also exceptionally aware of the sacri fi c es our se rv ic e m e mb e rs have m ade , par tic ular ly with the ir lives , throughout our history.
I wondered sometimes, though, what the mutilated children of Sierra Leone would think of such discussions if they could only fathom them.
I imagined parading them and the thousands of other victims and carcasses I witnessed in atrocity zones around the world through the wood paneled rooms of Washington, just as a reality check.
But sho rt of one hun dred percen t p ro tectio n, for wh ich t here is no plausible multilateral formula, we successfully negotiated into the treaty regime an impressive body of safeguards that critics continue to overlook in their zeal to trash the treaty.
W hen w e pursued our objectives with a degree of humility, we succeeded.
There is a tendency in negotiations of this character that involve our military services and international security, to arrive at hard and fast positions within the Washington bureaucracy that are either too self-protective or too tardy, or both, to be successful in multilateral negotiations, and to stick with those positions long after their futility is obvious to all.
Let me be frank: Military lawyers advising their superio rs ab out such negotiations, and I have in mind both the Land Mines Treaty and the Rome Treaty on the International Criminal Court, need to be careful not to succumb to what will sound gutsy and All-American within the JCS Tank but will fail miserably when presented to other governments.

Our superpower status and the magnitude of our military forces mean very little in these settings.
That is the hard reality today.
We need to adjust and turn that reality to our own advantage with winning strategies and not self-righteous tactics that impress no one but ourselves.
During the N ovember-December 20 00 negotiatio ns of the Preparatory Commission, our friends recommended that we should focus on our greatest strength--the principle of complementarity--as our first line of defense.
The U.S. delegation worked hard in the ICC talks to ensure that there are safegu ard s in t he treaty regim e s o th at t he Cou rt does n ot h it American service members with unwarranted actions.
We built into the treaty procedures by which countries with strong legal systems can investigate an d, if merited, prosecute their ow n citizen s and t hus req uire th e court to back off.

Much of the complementarity regime originated with us an d we prevailed in its adoption.
Indeed, in some circumstances the Rome Treaty regime offers military personnel greater protection from foreign prosecution than do current law and practice.
If the Court disregards or abuses the complementarity regime, it will quickly lose its legitimacy in the eyes even of the treaty parties.
We know from the negotiations and the ratification p roceedings und ertaken so far that a vib rant co mplementarity p ractice by th e Co urt is essent ial to the Court's survival and to its acceptance by its strongest supporters, w ho have no intention of being hauled before the Court themselves!

indeed w ould work, an d how, as w ith all matters of law, there are some gray areas that will have to be worked out in the practice of the Court.
In D ecember, th e U .S. delegation int rod uced a treaty-friend ly proposal for the Relationship Agreement between the United Nations and the Court now being debated in New York.8 There are numerous provisions in t h e Rel a t i o n s h i p A g reemen t t h at d e s c ri b e t h e n eed fo r co o p erat i o n between the United Nations and the Court.
This proposal joins that list of provisions.
States that are contributing to U.N. peacekeeping operations or other necessary international missions outside their own borders will be encouraged to co ntin ue maki ng such con trib utio ns if t hey kno w that an y cas e brought against their personnel in the ICC is indeed an admissible case.
Acting strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Statute, the Court has the authority to ensure that admissibility indeed is examined.
The Statute's preamble emphasizes the imp ortance of complementarity, and Articles 17, 18, and 19 reinforce that objective, as do the Rules of Proced ure and E vi d enc e.9 A st ate 's kn o w led g e th at adm is si b il it y w i ll b e examined in certain cases will encourage that state and others to properly and faithfully investigate and prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in domesti c courts as en visaged by th e p rin cip le o f complementarity.
The U.S. proposal focuses the Court's attention on admissibility at a critical moment, namely when the request for surrender is made.
For contributors to international peace and security to know that the Court is using its authority at that time to ensure fairness in the process will add greatly to the confidence of all states to contribute to U.N. peacekeeping and other international efforts to maintain or restore peace and security.
We crafted the provision in consultation with several of our allies.
It would require the Court, on its own motion as provided pursuant to Article 19(1) of the treaty, to review the admissibility of a case in accordance with Article 17 wh en there is a request for the surren der o f a suspect who is charged in such case with a crime that occurred outside the territory of the suspect's state of nationality.

mary concern of the United Nations, and indeed of the United States, is to ensure that their deployments abroad to maintain or restore international peace and s ecurity are p rop erl y bal an ced w ith the Co urt's ju risd ictio n, whereas military forces that commit internal atrocities cannot be considered as pursuing any viable objective of international peace and security.
Internal atrocities are such an important focus of the Court's mission that it would be futile, particularly with our European friends, and contrary to our own interests to introduce additional procedures into the investigation and prosecution of indigenous perpetrators of internal atrocities.
Our proposal would ensure that the Court would examine the admissibility of any case involving an American service member.
United States fede ral and m ilitar y cour ts have sever al opportuniti e s to seize a ca se against an American service member and thus avoid ICC jurisdiction.
If, by the time the International Criminal Court has investigated an American service member and indicted him or her and then requested his or her surrender, our own a uthorities ha ve not ex erci sed thei r co m p le me nt ar it y rights to investigate and adjudicate that individual's alleged crime and thus void any ICC scrutiny, then we have only ourselves to blame.
The new proposal erects a final firewall, meaning that whether or not the admissibility of a case has been reviewed in the past, the Court must, on its ow n motion, review admissibility at the critical moment when the request for surrender is being framed.
T he state of n ationality thus will have one more opportunity to demonstrate its performance of the complementarity criteria in an effort to prevent such surrender.
Since the Court can review admissibility on its own motion at any time, the U.S. proposal simply articulates a procedural agreement between the United Nations and the Court, binding on the Court, to ensure that a final admissibility review occurs before the suspect arrives in The Hague.
The proposal is reasonable and compatible with and in accordance with the treaty itself.
We would be foolish not to pursue it vigorously in the on-going talks, although I fear the march of folly has already begun.
Multilateral negotiations are as much about missed opportunities and bad timing as they are about anything else.
Critics have charged that there are inadequate due process protections in the Rome Treaty.
Guided by career lawyers from the Justice, Defense, and State Departments, the U.S. delegation negotiated procedures and definitions of crimes consistent with our constitutional and military law practice.
Monroe Leigh, Secretary of State Henry Kissinge r's Legal Adviser, believes the treaty regime, including its rules, "contains the most detailed list of due process protections which has so far been promulgated; not bet-

Neither d oub le jeop ardy n or t he u se o f anonymous witnesses are permitted.
The fact that the treaty requires trial by judges and not by jury is not surprising in an international criminal court that merges common and civil law practice.
It is well settled extradition practice to accept trial without jury outside the United States.
The difficulty that the treaty's procedures arguably present under the U.S. Constitution, n amely the Six th Amendment, is if the United States were to become a party to the treaty and an A meri can ci t izen commit s on U.S. te rritory g e n oc i de , cri m es ag a in s t humanity, or w ar crimes that meet the court's rigorous test of admissibility--a highly unlikely event.
The reality is that our own prosecutors would pounce on that individual so fast the International Criminal Court would never have a right under the Rome Treaty to investigate him.
We successfully negotiated the procedures that grant our own justice system maximum discretion to seize a case against any U .S. citizen, even if the crime is committed overseas, and if merited indict and prosecute him before an American jury.
We have it within our power not to permit extradition of an American citizen to the Court in violation of the Constituti on.Nor would the United States tolerate the International Court's misuse of its powers against American service members.
Imagine the long-term consequences for the Court if it were to leap over the safegu ard s already lo ck ed i nto th e treaty reg ime and ab use its authority against our service members.
Anyone can paint a worst-case scenario that defies the entire construct of the treaty regime and the internatio nal p oli tical sy stem; b ut n o on e can dis co un t th e s ign ificance of th e probable consequences of an extreme course of action on those who must make the decisions and then live with them.

I respectfully submit that the rest of the world will not be impressed and will soldier on drafting documents of central importance to the operation of the Court.

I sometimes found my colleagues from other agencies proposing strategies that would be suitable for bilateral negotiations, where the United States might have considerable leverage, but would be of limited relevance in multilateral settings.
I believe w e should engage constructively in th e Preparatory Commission neg otiation s to protect our interests, build a credible court, and overcome flaws by pressing reasonable proposals that other governments can embrace without having to reverse their long-standing support for the treaty.
A major aim of U.S. signature of the treaty was to strengthen our negotiating hand, not immobilize it.
In coming months talks will continue on the crime of aggression and how parties to the treaty will oversee the operation of the Court.
On the crime of aggression, we must prevail.
We have repeatedly stated our position, which we are not alone in expressing, and we must continue to press for the proper definition and trigger for the crime of aggression.

diers and citizens by engaging on all fronts in this often-tedious struggle for law than we will if we sit on the sidelines or futilely hector our allies.
The United States should leverage its new status as a signatory nation to prevail with the treaty-friendly proposals, one of which I have already discussed, that the United States already introduced last year and can be debated in the Preparatory Commission this year, if not for the Relationship Agreement then perhaps for another supplemental agreemen t.Other governments have not rejected them and they hold considerable promise.
If the United States exhibits an anemic presence at the U.N. talks, we will forfeit perhaps the last opportunity we have in the Preparatory Commission to better protect our interests.
There are other steps that the United States should take unilaterally.
First, both critics and supporters of the Court should find common cause in amending the federal criminal code (Title 18) and the Uniform Code of Military J ustice (Ti tle 10 ) to en sure that crimes under th e treaty can b e fully prosecuted in U.S. courts.
Current codes are simply out-dated and may deprive us of our first line of defense.
An inter-agency task force was reviewing U.S. law to draw up recommendations when I left office.
I sincere ly hope that its work c ontinues a n d result s in le gi sla tion cre ati ng greater symmetry between U.S. law and the crimes and punishments specified in the Rome Treaty.
We do not want to invite a situation where the ICC concludes that the United States is unable to investigate and prosecute a particular individual because our legal codes do not include that individual's alleged offense as a crime punishable under U.S. law.
The U.S. delegation negotiated and accepted only what we, as a government, believe are actionable crimes under international criminal law.
We insisted on the Elements of Crimes, and led the negotiations of th at document for two years to a successful conclusion last June, because w e had to be certain the crimes are legitimate, actionable crimes.
But now w e must be certain we can easily turn either to Title 18 or to the UCMJ and identify therein an identical or near-identical crime.
We must be able to represent credibly that we have the ability to exercise our complementarity right and, if the evidence so requires, prosecute our own in our own courts.
In this vein, serious academic work has already begun, including important scholarship by Northwestern University Law Professor Douglass Cassel, who has set the stage for serious work on Title 18 and the UCMJ in his publications.11

The Uniform Code of Military Justice does not specifically address crimes against humanity or genocide as crimes, but it does allow for prosecution of the underlying criminal conduct.
12 Nor does all positive internati onal hu m anitari an law reside in the UCM J as war c rim es .
I have serious concerns whether that will be sufficiently persuasive to the judges or the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, each of whom will be looking for more explicitly stated crimes analogous to those set forth in Articles 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Rome Treaty.
Regarding federal law, the crime of genocide covers only U.S. nationals (committing genocide anywhere) or genocide within the United States (by anyone).13 Crimes against humanity are the least effectively implemen t ed b y d o me st ic law.
T h ere i s n o s u bs ta nt i ve crim in al s ta tu te fo r crimes against humanity per se, though various federal and state criminal statutes would allow punishment of criminal conduct constituting crimes ag a i nst hum an ity ( for e x a m ple, tort ur e, ra pe, kidna pping, o r var i ous assaults).
With respect to war crimes, the rule generally has been that only when Congress declares war are civilians accompanying the U.S. Armed Forces subject to the UCMJ. 14 The Military and Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 20 00 now p rov ides ju risd icti on over felo nies committed by civilians accompanyin g the A rmed Fo rces o utside the U nited States at all t imes, even when Congress has not declared war.15 There are also statutes of limitations under Titles 10 and 18 that are far too limited and could compel the International Criminal Court to con11.

clude that investigation is warranted simply because our domestic statute of limitations has run its course.16 These sections of the federal codes must be revised to reflect the crimes that need to be more explicitly stated in the codes and the reality of Article 29 of the Rome Treaty, which states: "The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations."
17 In a related initiative, when the Court begins to operate, the President should ap point a commission of experts to monitor fed eral and military courts exercising our rights under the treaty to investigate and prosecute our own.
This may shock those of you who would balk at any so-called oversight of our military court system.
What I have in mind is fairly modest.
There w ould be no pow er to intervene in or question the actions of military courts.
But the commission should have the authority to advise federal and military prosecutors, and perhaps through a transparent process the judges, about the experts' own views on whether the United States is pro perly ex erci sin g it s comp lemen tarity ri gh ts u nder th e Rome Treaty, even as a non-party.
Demonstrating our competence and willingness to exercise nation al ob ligatio ns wou ld dis co urag e scrutiny b y the Int ernational Court, and the commission of experts w ould heighten that sense of confidence in our system by the ICC prosecutor and judges.
Further unilateral steps we should take include exploring the protections our Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) already provide consistent with the treaty.
I am not speaking here of re-opening SOFAs to accomplish this objective.
Nor do I underestimate the argument that treaty proponents may make that ICC jurisdiction is a freestanding, independent right that the Receiving State could exercise in its own discretion by transferring persons to the ICC, even in the face of a SOFA provision.
But when the U.S. delegat ion s uccessful ly n eg oti at ed the in clus ion o f A rticle 98 (2 ) i n th e Rome Treaty, we had in mind our own SOFAs and their applicability.
Article 98(2) states: "The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act inconsistently w ith its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender."18 There are arguments waiting to 16.

be plucked in our SOFAs and in Article 98(2) that would ensure American service members are not surrendered to the Court.
Perhaps more importantly, even as a non-party, under Artic we can negotiate agreements with other governments that would any American being surrendered to the ICC from their respective tion s w itho ut our con sen t.
As a sign ato ry state, w e are now in stronger position to negotiate such freestanding agreements.
le 98(2) prevent jurisdica m uc h
I would further suggest that a time may well arrive w hen the United States could negotiate with the Court directly an Article 98(2) agreement that would protect American service members from surrender provided, most likely, the U nited States made certain commitments to the Court in terms of the proper and complete exercise of complementarity by American authorities and in terms of support for and cooperation with the Court, including, perhaps, ratification of the Rome Treaty that would lock in the all-important U.S. financial support.
Rule 195(2) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, 19 which we proposed and which was adopted by consensus last June, in my opinion offers the possibility of such an agreement.
We s ho u ld no t l o se s ig ht o f th e furt her pro tect io ns t hat th e treat y grants governments that ratify it.
These include avoidin g any exp osure whatsoever to war crimes charges for an initial seven years, which if chosen by the United States would afford us more time to evaluate the competency and fairness of the Court as its most powerful State Party.20 As a State Party, the United States would be entitled to opt out of any exposure by the Court to the crime of aggression forever.21 Given the reality of the use of U.S. military force, a reality that typically evokes groundless but nonetheless troublesome charges of aggression from our detractors, this right to opt out is significant.
Ratification also w ould permit the United Stat es to part ici pat e in th e o vers ig h t, s taffi ng , an d man agem ent of t h e International Criminal Court, as well as enable a U.S. citizen to serve as a judge.
Given our experience with the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunals, these are not insubstantial privileges.

Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, U.N. Doc. A/CONF.183/9 (1998) (United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Crim inal Court, July 17, 1998), reprinted in 37 I.L.M. 998 (1998) [hereinafter Rom e Statute].
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee was the distinguished professor of law at DePaul University and renowned commentator on international criminal law, M. Cherif Bassiouni.
The concept of a "statute," termed as such in international law, is in itself a recent and noteworthy development.
During recent testim ony to Congress, Ambassador David J. Scheffer, head of the United States delegation to the ICC negotiations and the subsequent Preparatory Com mission negotiations on the Rules of Evidence and Procedure and Elements of Crimes, explained the term as follows: When one speaks of creating a court on an international level, it has to have to som e governing document for the functioning of that court.
And as w ith th e Yugo slav tribun al an d th e R wa nda tribu nal, the S ecu rity Council adopted statutes or a statute for each tribunal, which is its constitution, basically, the court's own constitution, the basic principles by which the court must function.
It is simply a term of art that has arisen in the international sphere, and during th e talks for the IC C, it is that basic constitutional document of the court itself which is described as the statute.
The treaty itself, when ratified, em bodies that statute.
And I guess that the best I can say is that it's simply, in U.N. practice, once you have ratified the treaty per se, you are also, of course, adopting as part of that ratification practice or package the statute of the court itself.

egates burst into spontaneous applause, which transitioned into rhythmic app lause that continued for some time.9 By th e late evening of 17 July 1998, the delegates in Rome were caught up in a wave of jubilation and euphoria as they adopted the Rome Statute by a vote of 120 to seven, with twenty-one abstentions.10 For the proponents of the Rome Statute, the reality that it was adopted only by abandoning the historic diplomatic practice of consensus is immaterial.
Many ardent treaty supporters and the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that pushed for the Rome Statute ignore its structural flaws and view it as a triumph of international aspiration over the political and pragmatic realities of the international system that have prevented the evolution of an effective and permanent international criminal court since the end of World War I.11 Seen in the best possible light, the Rome Statute represents the hope of governments from all around the world that the force of international law can restrain the evil impulses that have stained history with the blood of millions of innocent victims.12 Thus, from this perspective, its hasty adoption in the last hours of the Rome Conference was warrant ed d esp it e the fact th at th e co mpl ex s ub st ant iv e in terface of t reaty provisions was never wholly debated or analyzed in depth until after the adoption of the Rome Statute.

In a very real sense, the proscriptions against genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the laws and customs of war contained in Article 5 of the Rome Statute13 embody the highest ideal of all legal systems that law can replace raw power as the defining norm of international relations.
Nevertheless, the Rome Statute elevates principle above practicality because its adoption was not accompanied by any resolution of the details for establishing an effective supranational judicial forum.
For example, in adopting the Rome Statute without the support of the United States, treaty proponents failed to consider a viable formula for funding the ICC.

would allow supranational justice and accountability to pierce the shield of unconstrained sovereignty.17 Indeed, the very impetus for a permanent ICC arose from the numerous instances in which powerful perpetrators18 ignored established intern a ti on a l no r m s wi th im pu ni ty.
The p e nu lt im a t e v o t e s a t th e R o m e Conference came about only as a reaction against the historic practice of tyrants who warped domestic legal mechanisms into tools for imp osing their will.
Adolf Hitler, for example, imposed the Fuehrerprinzip (leadership principle) in order to exercise his will as supreme through the police, the courts, and all other institutions of civilized society.19 Through the lens of absolute state sovereign ty, efforts by one state to establish individu al accountability over nationals of another state for violations of international crimes were frequently derided for using the figleaf of justice to legitimize the expressions of raw political power over the perpetrator.
Thus, when given a copy of his indictment before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, Herman GÃ¶ring stroked the phrase "[t]he victor will always be the judge and the vanquished the accused" across its cover.20 Logically, an effective supranational court should function as a fallback forum to prosecute individuals who commit crimes while in the service of authoritarian regimes that ignore the binding norms of international law.
Those regimes are the most prone to commit the crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC, and yet those same states could previously invoke prin cipl es of so verei gn ty to prot ect their n at ion als from p ro secut ion in their domestic judicial forums.
At the conclusion of the Rome Conference, treaty supporters concluded that an effective ICC cou ld not rest the full 17.

extent of its judicial power on the consent of a state because regimes that ignore the rule of law would be virtually certain not to submit their nationals to the jurisdiction of the court.
Hence, the final "package" that became the Rome Statute bypassed the traditional rule of international law that a treaty "does not create obligations or rights for a third [s]tate w ithout its consent."21 To attain the goal of international justice, Article 1 of the Rome Statute promulgates in simple lan guag e that th e co urt will "be a permanent institution and shall have the power to exercise its jurisdiction over persons for the most serious crimes of international concern . . . and shall be comple m en tar y to n at i on al c r im ina l ju ri sdic ti ons ."
22 T h e Ro me St at u t e nowhere defines the term "complementarity," but the plain text of Article 1 compels the conclusion that the International Criminal Court is intended to supplement the foundation of domestic punishment of international violations, rather than supplant domestic enforcement of international norms.
Indeed , the principle that states are obligated to use domestic forums to punish violations of international law has roots that run back to the ideas of Hugo Grotius.23 As early as 1842, Secretary of State D aniel Webster articulated the idea that a nation's sovereignty also entails "the strict and faith ful observance of all those prin ciples, laws, and usages which hav e obtained currency among civilized states, and which have for their object the mitigation of the miseries of war."24 The co m plem entarity princi ple is th e fu lcr um that prior itizes the authority of domestic forums to prosecute the crimes defined in Article 5 of the Rome Statute.
Phrased another way, the complementarity principle is intended to preserve the power of the ICC over irresponsible states that refuse to prosecute nationals who commit heinous international crimes, but balances that supranational power against the sovereign right of states to 21.

34, reprinted in 8 I.L.M. 679 (1969).
The logical corollary to this rule (which the Rome Statute disregards) is that a multilateral instrum ent binds a state that does not ratify the treaty only when the third party "expressly accepts that obligation in writing."

The complementarity principle is therefore the critical node in ascertaining w hether the ICC will trample on the sovereign prerogatives of states, or will coexist in a constructive and beneficial relationship with all nations.
The monumental and controversial development in the Rome Statute is that the proponents of international justice established a framework for a supranational court that enshrines the principle that state sovereignty can on occasion be subordinated t o th e goal of achievin g acco untability fo r violations of international humanitarian law.25 Indeed, one commentator in Rome declared that "outmoded n otions o f state so vereign ty must not derail the forward movement" which seeks to achieve international peace and order.26 Th e co mp lex b lend of civ il law, com mon law, cu st omary international law, and sui generis that combine in the Rome Statute is held together by the notion that the sovereign nations of the world are joined, not as competitors in the pursuit of sovereign self interest, but as interde25.

solved procedural issues that could thwart the actual practice of the ICC prosecutor.
One of the most important benchmarks in any future prosecution before the International Criminal Court will be the actual decision to transfer responsibility for prosecuting a particular perpetrator to the standing supranational institution from a domestic system that could otherwise exercise jurisdiction over the crime.
Despite its simple formulation, the concept of complementarity represents the focal point of tension between the proponents of the Rome Statute and those who regard its provisions as an unjustified and illegal subversion of sovereign rights.
Th e p r in c i p l e o f c o m p le m e nt a r ity is th e li nc h p i n f o r a s s e ss in g whether t he "last majo r internat ional institu tion established in this century"31 will become a functioning reality or an international absurdity.
It is plain that the Rome Statute stands for the proposition that accountability for war crimes "cannot be achieved without impinging upon the traditional crimin al j uris di ct io n o f s tates ."32 Th e pri ncip le o f co mpl ement arity is therefore the bridge that carries the weight of the Rome Statute.

Jurisprudential Roots of Complementarity The discipline of international criminal law33 springs from the intersection of two legal traditions that are separate yet interrelated.
The criminal aspects of international law are historically and juridically intertwined with the inter n a t io nal as pe c t s of na tiona l c rim ina l la w. Th e cr imin al aspects of international law can be traced to a variety of sources in which the nations of the world united to criminalize certain conduct under established international norms.34 Prohibitions against piracy 35 and slavery36 are tw o o f th e earl i es t su b s ta nt i v e i n ter na ti o n al cri me s th at o v er ti m e became subject to the universal jurisdiction of all states.37 Crimes typically evolved as a matter of customary international law, which in turn was codified in binding international conventions.
Si nce di scussions concerning a perma nen t In tern at ional C rim in al Court began,38 the challenge to the international community has been to distill a practical formula for reconciling or prioritizing the jurisdictional clai ms between an emergin g sup ranatio nal instit utio n an d the domesti c 33.
Though com monly used by scholars and practitioners in this field, the concept of a distinct discipline termed "international criminal law" is not universally accepted across the world.
See, e.g., Leslie C. Green, Is There an International Criminal Law?, 21 ALBERTA L. REV. 251 (1983).
In the context of negotiating the Elem ents of Crim es required by Article 9 of the Ro me Statute, some delegations vehemently argued that the concept of "interna t io na l c ri m in al l aw " it se lf w a s t oo il l-d e fi ne d t o w a rr an t i nc lu s io n in a d o cu m e nt designed to "assist the Court in the interpretation and application" of the norms defined in the Rome Statute.

Paradoxically, the substantive norms of internatio nal crimin al law did n ot develop as a coex is tent component of the early efforts to develop the framework for an international criminal court.39 The articulation of a defined set of international offenses proceeded in separate negotiations for different reasons than the discussions over the development of an international criminal institution.
This lack of synchronization helps explain why the crimes proscribed in the Rome Statute do not replicate every act that is prohibited as a matter of international law.
Nevertheless, the judicial authority of domestic forums to impose criminal responsibility for serious violations of international law is an essential underpinning of the jurisprudential framework of the complementarity principle.
Similarly, the practice of the two currently functi on ing ad hoc tribunal s em po wered to prosecu te serious violat io ns of international humanitarian law40 helps foreshadow the reality of the difficulty th at t he ICC prosecuto r wi ll face in trans fo rmi ng the princip le o f complementarity into a pragmatic reality.

A. Domestic Enforcement of International Crimes 1.
Legal foundations The ICC is intended to reinforce rather than overturn the well-established right of sovereign states to enforce international humanitarian law; the principle of complementarity embodies this linkage.
The legal authority of domestic states to proscribe and adjudicate cases invo lving violatio ns of h uman itarian law is s o firml y ro oted in t he in tern atio nal l egal regime that the Ro me Statute makes no distinction between states party and n on -st ates part y w it h res pect to co mpl emen tari ty. Pu t s imp ly, fo r every single act by every single accused that could theoretically be subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC, there would be one or more sovereign states that have legal authority to investigate and prosecute the case.
On its face, the Rome Statute makes no distinction between states that have ratified the treaty and those that have not with respect to the complemen tarity p rin ci ple o r the proced ures for ass ess ing the proper forum to adjudicate a particular case or perpetrator.
In this light, the Preamble categorically states that "it is the duty of every State to exercise its jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes."41 Prosecution of every serious violation of humanitarian law in domestic forums could, in theory, be viewed as having attained the goal of ICC supporters who hope that the movement tow ards a permanent sup ranational court will help guarantee respect for and enforcement of international justice.
Complementarity is therefore a fundamental underpinning of the ICC regime that could also be an important incidental means for achieving the worthy goals of treaty proponents.

The author prefers to use the ter m "international humanitarian law" merely as a linking phrase to associate the laws of ar med conflict with the other substantive bodies of norms that may also apply to a particular conflict.
The phrase is quite commonly used as a shorthand reference to the entire corpus of law that governs the conduct of hostilities, in addition to offenses such as genocide and crimes against humanity which carry the weight of international authority by virtue of their clear status as substantive prohibitions recognized under customary international law.
The phrase should not imply that the law of armed conflict is indistinct or merged with the field of human rights law.
Among many other differences, the laws of armed conflict are lex specialis and apply in limited circumstances to reverse the normal patterns of peacetime.
In other words, under the laws of arm ed conflict, conduct that would normally be unlawful by definition is presumed to be lawful unless it contravenes the established norms regulating conflicts.

The comprehensive scope of jurisdiction enjoyed by sovereign states in enforcing international humanitarian law arose in part because domestic military codes presaged the body of rules that later ripened into international humanitarian law.

In the midst of the Thirty Years' War, for example, G ustavu s Ad olphus of Swed en pro mu lgated a punitive military code that contained a general warning that "no Colonel or Captain shall command his soldiers to do any unlawful thing; which so does, shall be punished according to the discretion of the Judge."
42 Similarly, in May 1863, the Union Army issued a disciplinary code governing the conduct of hostilities (known worldwide as the Lieber Code) as "General Orders 10 0: Ins tru cti ons for th e Go vern men t o f the Armies of th e U ni ted Stat es i n t he Fi eld ."43 M il it ary co des of d is cip li ne es tab li sh ed guidelines for gauging the scope of permissible conduct during conflicts that later evolved into the detailed codifications of international humanitarian law that underlie the proscriptions found in the Rome Statute.

Furthermore, as a mirror image of the fact that the complementarity principle applies to all states in the international community and all crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC, international law today justifies universal jurisdiction for any state to adjudicate the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and serious war crimes.51 This facet of international law developed despite the practice of some states that used the pretext of war crimes prosecutions for the purpose of political repression or psychological man ipulation.52 Tod ay, every state po sses ses the juridical ability to proscribe and prosecute the crimes detailed in the Rome Statute.

55 Based on the finding that "international law imposes duties and liabilities on individuals as well as upon States has long been recognized," the IMT rejected defense arguments that international law governs only states, as well as the contention that the doctrine of state sovereignty shields perpetrators from personal responsibility for their actions.56 In addi tio n, wi th regard to g enoci de an d crimes again st h umani ty, customary international law p ermits individual responsibility for crimes 53.

international humanitarian law have come in domestic forums as opposed to in ternation al tribunals.
In contrast to the original tw enty-fo ur defen dants charged before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg,59 thousands of war criminals were prosecuted in the Allied zones of occupation b y courts exercising sovereign p ower on G erman soil.60 Similarly, from 1946 to 1948, Australian, American, Filipino, Dutch, British, French, Chinese, and Australian courts convicted several thousand war criminals in the Pacific theater.61 The drafters in Rome recognized the reality that the ICC will have limited resources and political capital.
Accordingly, the Ro m e S tat ute includes a number of subjective threshol ds designed to ensure that domestic forums will continue to adjudicate the vast majority of cases, while the ICC itself focuses on a smaller number of more severe or difficult prosecutions.
As a fundamental check on its power, the substantive jurisdiction of the ICC is restricted to only "the mos t serious crimes o f co ncern to th e international community as a whole."62 Article 5(1) requires that the jurisdiction of the ICC "shall be limited" by the "most serious crimes of concern" threshold.63 This textual limit on the scope of ICC jurisdiction has both a de scr i ptive and subjec tive co m pone nt.
I nde ed , the m y r ia d of offenses detailed in Articles 6, 7, and 8 are tragic and inherently serious from a humanitarian perspective.
In order to fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC, however, the offense must be on the high end of a scale of relative severity, and must have some quality that warrants the subjective assessment th at the cri me i s of "co ncern to th e in ternatio nal commu nity as a whole."
This limitation applies to every crime detailed in the substantive provisions of Articles 6, 7, and 8.

concern" threshold is an up-front textual device that restricts the reach of the ICC, which in turn preserves the de facto latitude of sovereign criminal forums.
The "most serious crimes of concern" threshold is intellectually distinct from the complementarity regime.
As discussed below,64 the compleme ntarity pr inci ple ( and it s acc ompa nying m ec h an ism gover n ing the admissibility of a given case) serv es to allocate power between the ICC and domestic forums over cases that could properly be prosecuted either in the ICC or in one or more domestic forums.
If a case is sufficiently minor, which is an admittedly subjective inquiry, the "most serious crimes of concern" threshold means that the ICC does not have substantive jurisdiction over the conduct, even if the activity could possibly meet the criteria as one of the det ailed offenses p ros cribed b y A rticles 6 (Genocide), 7 (Crimes Against Humanity), or 8 (War Crimes).
65 Phrased another way, there will be criminal offenses that could theoretically meet the complementarity test for admissibility, yet remain beyond the scope of permissible ICC jurisdiction because of their minor or isolated nature and scope.

This precludes the misconception that the Rome Statute enacts some new regime of international federalism where sovereign states are deemed to be subordinate to 64.

Building on the moral legacy of Nuremberg,69 the United Nations Security Council decided to take action in 1993 and 1994 to create the first truly international tribunals since World War II, designed to prosecute individuals responsible for the horrendous acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and massive war crimes that took place in the territory of the former Yugoslavia 70 and Rwanda.71 Bec ause th e S ecu rity Council has "p ri mary r esponsibil it y fo r the maintenance of international peace and security,"72 the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) are both grounded on a finding that judicial 68.

in tern at io na l t rib un al nev ert hel ess h as e xp li cit ju ri sd ict io n al "p rim acy over national courts."80 The jurisdictional primacy of the ICTY and ICTR springs logically from the preeminent authority granted to the Security Council in pursuit of its plenary role in restoring international peace and security.
The legal and common sense of the term "primacy" necessarily conveys a jurisdictional hierarchy in which domes tic jurisdictions retain the ability to prosecut e perpetrators, but which preserves an "inherent supremacy" for the international tribunal.81 As a result, if a domestic court is proceeding with a case that is oth erw ise with in the jurisd iction al comp et en ce of the ICT Y and ICTR, th e international tribunal has unbounded legal discretion to order the national courts to defer to the international tribunal "at any stage of the proceeding."82 Applying this right of primacy, the first case brought to trial before the ICTY involved an accused named Dusko Tadic who had been facing trial in Germany on charges of murder, aiding and abetting genocide and causing grievous bodily harm.83 Though the ICTY only had one court room at the time, its trial court ordered the pending German case transferred to The Hague despite the fact that the Office of the Prosecutor had not yet indicted Tadi c (th at ind ictment w as con fi rm ed and is su ed fo ur mon ths after th e transfer).84 Tadic appealed this transfer o n ju risdictional grou nds. Th e ICTY Appeals Chamber upheld the implementation of ICTY primacy that denied Tadic a German trial on the rationale that the Security Council had acted "on beh alf o f the co mmun ity of nat ion s" by end ow ing a j ud icial organ with au thority to address "t ransboundary ma tt ers" which affect international peace and security.85 This legal reasoning also justifies the pr inci p l e tha t -- b e ca u se the I CT Y an d I C TR en jo y d er i va tive po we r 80.

The complementarity principle is an essential cornerstone of the Rome Statute, which on its face represents a radical retreat from the theoretical primacy of the ICTY and ICTR.

In reality, the gap between primacy and complementarity as organizing jurisdictional principles may not be so expansive; there is to date no clear evidence that either primacy or complementarity claim inherent functional superiority as a core organizing principle.88 In point, both ad hoc international tribunals often face "total defiance" from states regarding orders to transfer indictees and to provide evidence, 85.

T he negotiating tex ts are riddled with brackets and often-contradictory proposals for further negotiations.93 Nevertheless, the principle of complementarity represents one golden thread of consensus that runs through every documentary step along the road towards the supranational criminal court.
This axiom, that the ICC is "nei th er des ig ned no r in ten ded " to s up pl ant in dep end en t and effect iv e domestic judicial systems, served as a guiding principle found throughout the long series of diplomatic interchanges culminating in the Rome Statute.94 Complementarity is an intellectually simple principle that cannot be distilled into one snippet of isolated treaty text.
Despite widespread agreement over the complementarity principle during the Preparatory Committee meetings prior to the Rome Conference, its textual manifestation was deeply interconnected with the many other highly contentious fundamental issues.
Debates in Rome raged over vital issues related to complementarity such as the definitions of crimes, the precise scope o f substantiv e ju risd ict io n, t he co ncep tu al b asis for ICC j uri sd icti on ov er in di vi du als (whether territorial, national, universal, or some combination thereof), the trigger mechanism for beginning investigation or initiating prosecution of an individual or group of offenses, and the mechanism for preventing prosecutorial abuse of discretion for political purposes.

Rather than serving as the point of initial consensus in one isolated text, the complementarity principle became the cornerstone for many other debates , mu ch lik e th e first d omi no in a series, to b egin t he process o f negotiation and agreement.
As a result, the Rome Statute emerged with a complex, layered procedural structure, but one in which the complementarity principle was preserved.
To illustrate, once a particular offense rises ab ove t he "most seriou s crimes o f co ncern" th resho ld,102 th e case must meet the preconditions for jurisdiction outlined in Articles 12 through 16 (which were not finalized until the last day of the Rome Conference).103 The complementarity principle is further embedded as an additional procedural requirement found in Article 17, which requires the ICC to "determi n e t h at a cas e i s i n ad m i s s i b l e" w h ere cert a i n cri t eri a are m e t .
104 Logically, cases failing to meet these admissibility criteria are reserved to the judicial authority of one or more sovereign states.
In order to implement the complementarity principle implemented by the Rome Statute, the ICC prosecutor and judicial chambers must respect and adhere to the statute's admissibility criteria.
Article 17 represents the most direct mechanism for allocating responsibility for a certain prosecution between the ICC and one or more domestic sovereigns that may have jurisdictional authority.
Where the textual criteria of Article 17 are satisfied such that a case is "in admiss ible," th e Rome Stat ute constrain s th e authority of the ICC prosecutor and judicial chambers.

The Trial Chamber is accordingly required to "satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it."109 105.

The final package that became the Rome Statute is structured around a dual track system of jurisdiction.110 Article 13 implicitly rejects a simple assertion of universal ICC jurisdiction by limiting the court's jurisdictional authority to cases referred either by the United Nations Security Council or to those referred using carefully described jurisdictional comp etence.
This delegated grant of jurisdictional authority to the ICC and its prosecutor necessarily reserves to states the discretion to prosecute any cases that fall outside the established Article 13 parameters.
As a check on the power of states, and hence a limit to complementarity, Article 13(b) is particularly relevant.
Article 13(b) allows the Security Council to refer a case to the ICC prosecutor acting under its Chapter VII authority.
This path was embodied in the 1994 Draft Statute prepared by the International Law Commission111 and represents the simplest and least cont ro versial track tow ard s ICC adj udicatio n of a p art icular case.
Th e Security Council has absolute authority to define the territorial, temporal, or normative scope of the prosecutor 's license to proceed based on its plenary po wer with regard to actions designed to maintain or restore international peace and security.112 With regard to the complementarity principle, a Chapter VII referral would override a state's inherent national authority to insist on using its ow n jud icial p roces ses.
E ven th oug h jurisd iction und er Article 13 is a legal in quiry distinct from admissibility u nder A rticle 17 (which implements complementarity via the admissibility regime), a Security Council referral would supersede the state's right to use its own courts as the forum of first resort.
While the text of the Rome Statute ostensibly preserves a stat e 's au tho rity to imple m en t co m p lem e ntar ity fo llow ing a S ec u rity Co uncil referral, th e o bligation of all states to "accept and carry out th e decisions of the Security Council"113 effectively nullifies this right of complementarity.
Furthermore, all members of the U nited N ations are obligated to comply w ith orders of th e Secu ri ty Coun cil , even if t he Rom e 110.

In contrast, the second jurisdictional track under Article 13 invokes the very principles of state consent and territorial jurisdiction that the complementarity principle was intended to protect.
Article 13 allows either a state party115 or the prosecutor proceeding proprio motu116 to refer a case to the ICC.
The proprio motu power of the prosecutor was adopted over the opposition of the United States 117 and has significant implications for the complementarity principle that will be discussed in Part IV.
For cases referred by either a state party or the prosecutor (that is, cases not dependent on Security Council referral under Chapter VII authority), Article 12 implements a consent regime based on the territory on which the crime was committed118 or the nationality of the perpetrator.119 Thus, a case is subjec t to I C C jur i sdictio n if th e cr im e wa s co m m itte d o n te rr itor y th at belongs to a state party or another state that consents to the jurisdiction of the court.

The consent regime is also silent regarding the case of the so-called "traveling tyrant," 120 and would not grant ICC jurisdiction based only on the consent of a state that happens to have custody of the perpetrator.
121 Article 12 on its face permits the anomaly in which a non-state party commits heinous crimes on its own territory, but consents to the exercise of ICC jurisdiction only over the members of other nations, such as a United Nations coalition, that enter its territory to prevent further violations.
Despite the righ t of the non-state party to consent to crimes co mmi tt ed by s om e bu t no t all pers o ns o n i ts s oi l, th e n on -st at e part y retains the primary presumption of jurisdiction under the complementarity principle.122 In light of the complementarity principle, the provisions for nationality and territoriality jurisdiction can be considered as a set of "conflicts of jurisdiction rules."123 For example, in the case of a crime committed by the national of a non-state party on the territory of another non-state party that consents to the jurisdiction of the court, both states would have jurisdictio n under the est ab lished no rms o f int ernatio nal l aw.

127 This is phrased as a mandatory limitation on the reach of the court.
The admissibility criteria implement the complementarity principle by providing the textual basis for evaluating whether domestic authority over a particular case limits ICC authority over that case.
Furthermore, the procedures for obtaining preliminary ruling s regarding admissibility128 and challenging the prosecutor 's assertio n of admissibility129 provide the mech anism for translating complementarity from a theoretical principle to an enforceable check on the power of the ICC and prosecutor.

The earliest articulation of the admissibility criteria dates to the 1943 D raft Co n ven ti o n fo r th e Creat io n of an In tern ati on al Crim in al C ou rt, which simply stated that, "[as] a rule, no case shall be brought before the Court when a domestic court of any one of the United Nations has jurisdiction to try the accused and it is in a position and w illing to exercise such juri sdi ctio n."130 T he 19 94 In ternati onal L aw Co mmis sio n (ILC) D raft Statute preempted ICC authority in cases that were the subject of investigation by a state that produced an "apparently well-founded" decision not to proceed to prosecution.131 This limited concession to domestic authority was grounded on a statement in the Preamble of the ILC Draft Statute that the ICC was to be complementary to domestic legal systems in cases where trials "may not be available or may be ineffective."
132 Based on concerns that the ILC formulation was both too narrow (in the sense that even a sham prosecution could render a case inadmissible) and too vague,133 Article 17 expanded the scope of the earlier text to specify that the court shall determine that a case is inadmissible in the following circumstances: (1) the case is "being investigated or prosecuted by a State that has jurisdiction over it;" (2) the case was the subject of a prior investigation and the state w ith jurisdiction "decided not to prosecute the person concerned;" (3) the person was already tried for conduct which is the sub130.

ject of ICC interest;134 or (4) the case is "not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court."135 The Rome Statute amended the subjective ILC admissibility criteria in two significant ways.
A case is admissible before the ICC only where a dom es tic sov ereign is "unw illi ng or un ab le to genu inely " carry o ut th e investigation or prosecution.136 The delegates in Rome rejected a vague concept of effectiveness and agreed upon "genuinely" as the most objective modifier that preserves a large degree of flexibility for the ICC prosecutor and court.137 The ICC prosecutor and court must make a subjective assessment whether the sovereign state is "genuinely unwilling" or "genuinely unable" to take action on the case.
This new standard also allows the supranational institution to review, and potentially reverse, the disposit ion of the case fo llo win g p ri or jud icial or in vesti gativ e acti on i n th e domestic system.
The potential for direct and deliberate ICC infringement over unchecked state sovereign ty resulted in extensiv e debate about th e best articulation of the criteria for determining whether a state is "unwilling"138 or "unable" 139 to take action on a particular case."

In order to clearly describe the effect of complementarity when matters are first referred to the ICC, the United States introduced a proposal in March 1998 that was later negotiated and included in the Rome Statute as Article 18.141 Prior to taking action on a case referred by a state party or initiating a proprio m otu investigation, the pros ecutor is requ ired to "no tify all States and those States which, taking in to a cco un t th e infor mat ion av ailable , woul d no rm ally exercise jurisdi cti on over the crimes co ncerned."142 The ab ility o f any state party to refer a case to the prosecutor for investigation extends to situations in which "one or more" of the crimes proscribed in the Rome Statute "appears to have been committed."

This final ground for inadmissibility always operates as a restriction on the scope of ICC authority in all cases, and its inclusion in the admissibility criteria just reinforces this intentional limitation.

No tab ly, the req ui rem en t fo r p ros ecuto rial n ot ificat ion to stat es-- design ed to permit th e exercise of domestic jurisdiction that would preempt ICC authority--does not include cases referred to the ICC prosecutor by the Security Council acting under its Chapter VII authority.
In practice, the process of generating a Chapter VII resolution would almost certainly give notice to the affected states.
In theory, a Security Council referral of a situation to the ICC would not prevent state investigation or prosecution of that case.
Notwithstanding the normal functioning of the complementarity mechanism, the presumption of state jurisdictional precedence vis Ã  vis the ICC would not trump the Security Council's legal authority to override domestic discretion.

Aside from the effect of complementarity at the onset of an tion, any state that has jurisdiction over a particular case may admissibility on the ground that it has completed or is pursuing gation or prosecution of a particular case.

At the tim e of this w riting, the United States has introduced a pr op os al to ad d an a dd iti on al sa feg ua rd in to th e co m ple m en tar ity m e ch an ism .
O n 7 December 2000, the United States submitted a formal proposal that would add a requirement to the Relationship Agreement between the ICC and the U nited Nations.
Despite the permissive language of Article 19(1) of the Rome Statute, see supra note 109, the United States proposal requires the court to determine the admissibility of a case "when there is a request for surrender of a suspect who is charged with a crim e that occurred outside the territory of the suspect's State of nationality."
U.N. Doc. PCNICC/2000/WGIC C -UN/DP.17.
In the words of Am bassador Scheffer, this new proposal "erects a final firewall, meaning that whether or not the admissibility of a case has been reviewed in the past, the Court must, on its own motion, review admissibility at the critical moment when the request for surrender is being framed."
Ambassador David J. Scheffer, Address at the Judge Advocate General's School, Waldem ar A. Solf Lecture in International Law: A Negotiator's Perspective on the International Criminal Court (Feb. 28, 2001).
In his address, Ambassador Scheffer explained the importance of the admissibility proposal in the Relationship Agreement as follows: The state of nationality thus will have one m ore opportunity to dem onstrate its performance of the complementarity criteria in an effort to prevent such surrender.
Since the Court can review admissibility on its own m otion at any tim e, the U.S. proposal simply articulates a procedural agreement between the United Nations and th e C ourt, binding on the Court, to ensure that a final admissibility review occurs before the suspect arrives in The Hague.
The proposal is reasonable and compatible with and in accordance with the treaty itself.
We would be foolish not to pursue it vigorously in the on-going talks, although I fear the March of Folly has already begun.

Trial Chamber or prosecutor regarding admissibility or jurisdiction may be appealed on an interlocutory basis.151 As a general rule, a state is permitted only one challenge to a determination of admissibility or jurisdiction, which should be made prior to the st art of t h e tri al i n th e ICC Tria l Ch am ber.152 Th e text is vague as to whether this means one appeal as to jurisdiction with an additional appeal regard ing ad missibility, or whether both g rou nds fo r removin g t he cas e from ICC autho rity shou ld b e combined in on e appeal.
Ho wever, even after the beginning of the trial, the Rome Statute permits challenges to the admis sibi lity of a case based on the fact th at the person co ncern ed has already been tried for the conduct that is the subject of the complaint.153 As the sole basis for challenging admissibility after the start of a trial, this provision fu rther pres erves co mp lementarit y by placi ng a premium on domestic procedures that yield speedy dispositions.
This is true because a previously completed trial would logically have prevented admissibility at an earli er s tage.
T he s tate w ith ju risd icti on cou ld t heo ret icall y try th e accused in absentia, even if a domestic trial began after the ICC prosecutor started presentation of the case to the Trial Chamber.
The complementarity principle dictates in these circumstances that a co mpleted domestic trial w ould stop an o ngoing ICC prosecu tion.
Th e right of a state to end an ICC proceeding based on complementarity does not depend on a specified trial verdict or a particular level of punishment.
Nevertheless, Article 20 outlines the substantive requirements for sustaining a claim based on a prior prosecution, consequently removing that case from the judicial power of the ICC Trial Chamber.

Regarding the interface w ith national courts, the delegates in Rome found that agreement on the ne bis in idem principle was much easier than the broader admissibility criteria under Article 17,155 even though they embedded it as an additional ground for inadmissibility under Article 17.156 Article 20 sets ou t the stan dard s for as sessin g wh ether a d omesti c adjudication of a case makes it inadmissible before the ICC.
The discussions ov er ne bis in idem in Rome came in the wake of the hard-fought compromises on the complementarity provisions related to national investigations or ongoing prosecutions.157 In contrast to the parallel "unwilling or un ab le genuinely " standard applicab le to invest ig at ions or ongoing prosecutions by states, the provisions for completed trials only amplify the "unwilling" prong.
The appropriate domestic courts were obviously able to handle a trial that was in fact completed.
The ne bis in idem standards applicable to domestic trials focus on domestic systems that have used the faÃ§ade of legal proceedings to thwart the ends of justice.
Unless the domestic trial purposefully shielded the accused from ICC authority,158 or the previous trial was conducted in a manner w hich w as inconsistent with an intent to bring the person to justice,159 the ICC prosecutor or court have no authority to impose supranational criminal accountability.
The blanket protection granted by Article 20 extends over a person for "conduct" that was the subject of the earlier domestic trial.
Any state's criminal proceedings shield the accused from further accountability before the ICC for any charges based on the same conduct (which in this context might be better conceived as misconduct).
Even as it preserves the right of do mestic state courts to supersed e ICC pun ishment based o n comp lementarity, Article 20 does not erect a rigid or unreasonable barrier to ICC admissibility of a particular case.
The ne bis in idem provisions of Article 20 are the logical capstone to the entire array of proced ural and subs tantiv e prov isio ns rel at ed t o implementi ng complementarity in the practice of the ICC and prosecutor.
The complementarity principle applies to domestic investigations, prosecutions, and completed trials, and the Rome Statute mandates the procedures for states to claim the right of complementarity.
The standards and procedural rules for recognizing a state's right to use its domestic forums are complex and 155.

interrelated.
Taken together, they provide a solid textual basis for nations with competent, functioning legal systems to adjudicate cases within their jurisdiction rather than being shoved aside by the ICC prosecutor or court.
This is the essence of the complementarity principle as it protects the right of sovereign states to resolve criminal cases.
Nevertheless, an ICC prosecutor, functioning under the international scrutiny that will be a normal facet of any supranational investigation or prosecution under the provisions of the Rome Statute, bears the burden of translating the provisions of the statute into actual practice.
Toward that endeavor, the Final Draft Rules o f Procedure an d Ev idence set fo rth req uirements relating to th e realization of complementarity.
C. Complementarity in the Final Draft Rules of Procedure and Evidence In contrast to the Rome Statute itself, the Final Draft Rules of Procedure and Evidence w ere adopted by consensus on 30 June 2000.
Although th e R ul es are "s u bo rd in at e in al l case s" t o th e R om e St atu t e, t he y ar e intended to facilitate the application of the statute in actual practice.160 The negotiations leading to the Draft Rules were in one sense a microcosm of the Rome Conference.
A complex document emerged from the conflicting approaches of lawyers and diplomats arguing from both civil and common law perspectiv es, flavo red w ith heavy lobby ing from non-governmen tal organizations focused on parochial interests, and spiced with a heavy dose of divergent personalities.
The weighty undertones of idealistic aspiration and raw politics that accompanied the Draft Rules discussions added to the intensity of the neg o ti a tions.
Give n the politic al dime nsion of the s e debates, it is unsurprising that the Final Draft Rules include several provisions that may affect the ability of states to invoke the complementarity principle.
One notable clarification in the Final Draft Rules limits the ability of states to selectively misuse the principle of complementarity.161 Although nati onal j urisd ictio n sh ou ld enj oy a "presu mpti on o f regu larity,"162 th e Rome Statute operates on a presumption that states will not politicize the 160.

domestic adjudication of cases within the scope of potential ICC jurisdiction.
The text of Article 12(3) allows a non-state party to consent to ICC authority "with respect to the crime in question."163 In theory, a non-state party cou ld consent to ICC jurisd iction over the conduct o f the internati on al fo rces dep lo y ed to it s terri to ry, w h il e ex emp ti n g i ts o w n arm ed forces fro m ICC au th ority.
E ven tho ug h su ch selecti ve cons ent w ou ld accord with the text of the Rome Statute, the state would thereby pervert the complementarity principle into a deliberate shield to deflect accountability for its citizens while using the ICC process as a political weapon against its adversary.
In order to remedy this anomaly and prevent such disparate justice, the Draft Rules provide specific guidan ce regarding a declaration under Article 12(3).
The delegates agreed to clarify the meaning of a state declaration by making an interpretive statement of principle.
Under the cons e n s u s ru l e, a s t at e d e cl ar at i o n t o accep t j u ri s d i c t i o n i n cl u d es "as a co ns eq u en ce t h e ac cep ta nce o f j uri s di ct io n w i th re sp ect t o th e c rim es referred to in Article 5 of relevance to the situation."
164 In other words, a declaration of consent by a non-state party to crimes committed on its territory means that the ICC prosecutor can investigate any acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes that were committed by any individual in connection with the "situation."
165 The ICC prosecutor has that broad investigative authority even if the non-state party intended that consent t o be directed again st a specified s et of i ndi vid uals o r a particu lar criminal violation.
As a result, this rule prevents an abuse of the complementarity that could otherwise have discredited the very notion of domestic trials under the supranational ICC umbrella.
The rules also include some notification provisions that could significantly impact on the exercise of state domestic authority to prosecute perpetrators.
In order to protect the rights of victims, the rules require that known victims or their legal representatives receive information at several critical procedural junctures.
The prosecutor, for instance, "shall inform victims " w hen subm itting a propr io mo tu inv es tigatio n to the Pre-Trial Chamber for authority to proceed.166 The victims in turn "may make rep163.

resentations in writing" to the Pre-Trial Chamber that would presumably assist the court in making its determination w hether the prosecutor has a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation.167 In addition, when the prosecutor seeks a ruling from the court regarding any question of jurisdiction or admissibility, 168 the rules require notification to both the state that referred the case and "victims who have already communicated with the court in relation to that case."
169 As a logical corollary, either the state or in t eres t ed v i cti m s " may mak e rep res en ta ti o n to t h e c om p et en t C h amber."170 The Rules specify that decisions over the commencement of an investigation by the Pre-Trial Chamber shall include the court's underlying reasons, and the ICC "shall give notice of the decision to victims who have made representations."171 In the abstract, these rules make sense from the perspective that the ICC is intended to promote values that are fundamental to all the w orld's citiz ens.
A gr ea te r f low of info rm ation be tw e en the IC C prosecu tor, affected states, and concerned victims may facilitate the pursuit of justice.
On the other hand, the rules nowhere mention any cross-examination or filtering of the "representations" made to the court.
Furthermore, the court itself has complete autonomy and responsibility for determining the applicable procedures for assessing issues of admissibility.
Alerting every identified victim will almost certainly result in personal, deeply moving pleas to the court.
Such representations are the antithesis of a process that rationally applies the legal norms of the statute to protect the sovereign authority of states to exercise complementarity.
An ICC judicial chamber that failed to app ly the jurisdiction al or admiss ibility criteria because of th e emotional impact of a victim's evidence would subvert the complementarity principle.
However, the D raft Rules provide this potential basis for eroding complementarity based on extrinsic victim testimony that is not relevant to the grounds for determining admissibility under the Rome Statute.
Conversely, victims may generate intense political pressure against the domestic state that would otherwise have authority to adjudicate th e 167.

case, thereby distorting that state's decision whether to defer to the ICC prosecutor or proceed with a domestic investigation or trial.
Finally, the rules contain explicit guidance for the court as it considers whether the state is genuinely unwilling to take action against the perpetrator.
This determination is a central element in the decision regarding whether the case is inadmissible before the ICC.172 In assessing the degree of state unwillingness to prosecute, along with the genuine character of a perceived unwillingness, the court may consider information tendered by the state that is seeking to invoke complementarity.
The rules specifically permit the state invoking complementarity to provide information showing that "its courts meet internationally recognized norms and standards for the indep endent and imp artial p rosecution of similar conduct."173 The ICC authority to override state jurisdiction is a serious matter.
The consensus rule allows the affected state to have the opportunity to present evidence related to its own justice system which may explain procedural or substantive issues that the court could incorrectly assess as manifesting genuine unwillingness or genuine inability sufficient to warrant ICC admissibility.
In addition, information provided by a domestic state with jurisdiction will generate international interest in the case that is quite likely to force the ICC to define and articulate the factors that make the case admissible.
This rule, in conjunction with the other Rules of Procedure related to admissibility determinations, demonstrates that the principle of complementarity is one of the cornerstones of the ICC investigative and judicial process.
Despite the significant guidance in the Rome Statute and the Rules of Procedure that seek a balance between complementarity and the effectiveness of the ICC, there are outstanding issues that will not be resolved until the court begins to function.
Section IV highlights some of the gaps and unresolved questions that could undermine the actual practice of the ICC regarding the principle of complementarity.
If the ICC and its prosecutor do not adhere to provisions for respecting the complementarity principle, the political backlash could eviscerate the ICC as a functioning institution with international credibility and support.

[Vol. 167
As shown above, the Rome Statute includes a comprehensive set of provisions and procedures that are designed to insulate sovereign authority to prosecute from unreasonable extension of ICC authority over sovereign judicial systems.
Some treaty proponents argue that the web of protections inspired by the complementarity principle giv es "ample assurance" th at th e IC C will m inimally cu rtai l sovereign au thorit y only by disp la cing domestic trials in "exceptional circumstances."174 At the same time, the Rome Statute contains absolutely no institutional constraints on the power and discretion of the ICC and prosecutor.
In fact, a key reason that th e complementarity regime is so thorough and detailed in the Rome Statute lies in th e reco gni tion b y treaty p ropo nents th at t he "in terp retatio n and application" of those provisions and standards is left solely to the ICC.175 Sin ce co mp lemen tarit y is bu ilt on the p remis e that the ICC i s n ot inhe rently super ior to sovere ign sta t es , th e supran a tional court is not supreme in theory.
The very autonomy that proponents sought for the ICC and its prosecutor, however, prevents external review or resolution of disputes over the court's implementation of the Rome Statute.
176 Arguably, the lack of any external checks and balances limiting the discretion of the ICC manifests a structural flaw creating de facto ICC superiority over sovereign states.
From this perspective, the mandatory phrasing of the comp l emen t a ry p r o v i s i o n s 177 a n d t h e i r bi nd in g na t u re fa il to gu a ra n t e e realization of the complementarity principle.
T he prosecutor is account able only to the trial chambers of the ICC itself, and the Rome Statute reinforces this unprecedented reallocation of power by providing that "any dispute concerning the judicial functions of the Court shall be settled by the BALANCE: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AN I NDEPENDENT AND EFFECTIVE CRIMINAL COURT 71 (1998).

decision of the Court."
178 The Rules of Procedure further specify that the ICC chamber reviewing issues of admissibility "shall decide on the procedure to be followed and may take appropriate measures for the proper conduct of the proceedings."179 One of the hallmarks of the complementarity regime is that it protects the prosecutorial and investigative prerogatives of all states without distinction based on membership in the ICC club.
While the Rome Statute provides that an unresolved dispu te between t wo or more p arties to th e Rome Statu te w ill b e referred to t he Ass embly o f St at es Parties ,180 th e Rome Statute is strikingly silent regarding any similar right of non-state parties.
This discrepancy could be view ed as an incen tive to become a party to the Rome Statute.
It could also create a strong incentive for the ICC to avoid disputes with states that are represented in the Assembly of States Parties, thus creating the potential for a tiered system of complementarity in which non-state parties are not accorded the same degree of deference.
Nevertheless, the p rosecutor 's unconstrained au thority, coupled with the co ntrol of the ICC judicial ch ambers, h as the potential to erode complementarity to its vanishing point as a mechanism for allocating prosecutorial power between states and the ICC.
The pro v is ions im plem en ting co m p le me ntar ity a re c o mp le x a n d often call for difficult subjective assessments by the court and prosecutor.
For instance, in reviewing a state's unw illingness, the prosecutor bears the burden of showing sufficient circumstantial evidence to warrant a finding that a delayed movement towards domestic prosecution "in the circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person to justice."181 The Rome Statute is silent on the need for any direct evidence of unwillingness in this case, and there is no provision for review of the court's decisions outside the ICC itself.
Artic le 17(2) (a ) fu r t her r equir es th e pr domestic disposition of the case "was made for person concerned from criminal responsibility diction of the Court."182 In this endeavor, the ose the fo r Ro cutor to show th at th e purpose of shielding the crimes within the jurisme Statute is structured

to allow the ICC prosecutor a wide margin of error.
If circumstantial evidence fails to establish the improper domestic purpose, a further provision allows admissibility if the ICC prosecutor persuades the ICC chamber to find a lack of independence or impartiality in the domestic court coupled with a manner of conducting the proceedings that was "inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice."183 These grounds for asserting ICC authority despite domestic action are all laced with subjective assess ments by the court and p rosecutor that are n ot su bject to any external review outside the ICC.
The very criteria that establish the prosecutorial burden of proof and specify the requisite evidentiary standards designed to implement complementarity may hold the seeds of its unchecked erosion.
The ICC prosecutor and court always bear the burden of showing that the standards have been met, but there is no external check to monitor adherence to the standards.
The ICC prosecutor must assess the admissibility criteria in light of undefined "principles of due process recognized by international law."
184 These standards are themselves defined by the ICC, which allows wide latitude for the ICC prosecutor to meet the "objective" admissibility criteria.
Moreover, if an ICC investigation is originally deferred to national jurisdiction, the ICC prosecutor is not restricted from taking later actions, subje ct to t h e re qu i rem en t t h at "h e o r sh e s h al l no t if y th e S ta te to w h i ch deferral of the proceedings has taken place."185 Finally, the propio motu power of the prosecutor allows abuse of the complementarity princip le b ecause the ad missi bility criteria in vite ICC intrusion into the domestic processes of sovereign states.
Because the ICC and its prosecutor can reasonably be expected to develop some guidelines and standards for evaluating domestic systems, the Rome Statute sets up an essentially circular paradox.
If a state does not meet the standards that the ICC announces through its internal procedures and court decisions, the domestic state may be deemed "genuinely unwilling" to handle the case by th e ICC.

ICC prosecutor wants to take over is admissible because the state is unable "genuinely to prosecute."
B. Properly Describing Jurisdiction Aside from the dispositive power of an unconstrained supranational court and prosecutor, the complementarity principle could be corroded by the very jurisdictional mindset of the ICC.
The concept of complementarity does not logically lead to a scheme of national and supranational concurrent jurisdiction.
Properly understood and implemented in accordance with the Rome Statute, the jurisdictional allocation of power between the ICC and states is best thought of as a tiered allocation of authority to adjudicate.
The ICC does not have authority to take a case or initiate an investigation until the issues associated with domestic jurisdictional criteria and admissibility standards are resolved.
Th e comp lemen tarity prin cip le was the mo ti vati ng fo rce b ehi nd a court built around a limited and defined authority to take jurisdiction that operates when needed to supplement domestic court systems.
From th e prosecutor 's point of view, jurisdiction under the provisions of A rticle 13 an d admissib ility u nder Article 17 are both mandatory p rerequisit es fo r ICC authority.186 This scheme is a significant evolution from earlier drafts th at all ow ed an "in heren t" ICC ju ris di ctio n o ver s om e cri mes. 187 T h e United States was on record as supporting such an inherent jurisdictional scheme for the genocide offenses.
188 In fact, the 1994 International Law Commission Draft included a provision that allowed the ICC to have automatic jurisdiction over the crime of genocide, which would have created a truly concurrent jurisdiction, at least over these offenses.189 A system built on a straight assertion of supranational primacy was not a "politically viable alternative for a permanent ICC." 190 A scheme of con current jurisdiction would hav e almost certain ly resulted in jurisdictional clashes between the ICC and one or more states with valid claims based on established principles such as nationality, territoriality, or passive personality.191 Rather than a flawed system of inherent or explicit concurrent jurisdiction, the Rome Statute's jurisdictional scheme requires the progr e ssive f a c t ua l inquir i e s a nd judic i a l f i ndings tha t i m ple m e n t 186.

Over time, the complementarity provisions may chafe an ICC prosecutor that sees them as an overly restrictive manifestation of arcane sovereignty principles.
The ICC prosecutor may begin to think of ju risd ict io n as co ncu rrent rat her t han tiered , and th ereb y min imi ze th e complementarity requirements.
Because the ICC does not have any external checks and balances, there is no institutional mechanism for controlling a court and prosecutor that seeks to expand supranational power over domestic forums in order to vindicate considerations of international justice.192 If t he ICC pros ecuto r begi ns t o v iew s up ran atio nal j urisd icti on as concurrent with sovereign state jurisdiction, the importance of the complementarity provisions as the trigger mechanism for ICC jurisdiction would obviously begin to erode.
This would produce more than just the technical 188.

In the 1948 debates over the Genocide Convention, the United States actually made a proposal that sounded remarkably close to the modern formulation of complementarity in the ICC context.
The proposal would have added an additional paragraph to Article VII of the Genocide Convention to read as follows: "Assumption of jurisdiction by the international tribunal shall be subject to a finding that the State in which the crim e was committed has failed to take adequate measures to punish the crim e."

undermining of abstract treaty provisions; it would minimize the ability of states to exercise their courts as proper forums for prosecuting violations of international humanitarian law.
Additionally, the ICC prosecutor might begin to assert jurisdiction in cases where one state w ith a jurisdictional claim consented to ICC adjudication of a particular case, but other states with equally valid claims were either not consulted or mooted based upon the p ros ecuto r 's unilateral as sess ment of inadmissib ility.
Tho ugh a fair reading of the Rome Statute indicates that admissibility can be waived by a state,193 no state should be allowed to waive the complementarity right of another state.
Finally, the Rome Statut e is silent o n the p ro per allocation of ICC authority in cases involving national amnesties or executive pardons.
A supranational court based on concurrent jurisdiction would in theory enjoy absolute authority to prosecute a case without regard for domestic legislative or political action.

Despite this, the ICC prosecutor, operating from the mistaken perspective of concurrent jurisdiction, may seek to exert supranational jurisdiction at will w ithout regard for the defined constraints of complementarity.
C. Character of Crimes The ICC prosecutor 's ultimate position on the concept of "ordinary crimes" may well be the hidden weakness in the complementarity regime as an effective limit to supranational power.

charges.
Such a practice would turn the principle of complementarity on its head.
In a r e gim e ba se d o n co nc ur r e nt jur i s d ic tio n be tw ee n d o m e sti c forums and an international court, the international court would have had preexisting jurisdiction in its own right regardless of the characterization of the crime under domestic law.
Under a regime of concurrent jurisdiction, even if the domestic courts decide a particular case, the principle of ne bis in idem198 would not preclude a subsequent trial before the international tribunal if "the characterization of the act by the national court did not co rrespo nd to its characterization" in the in ternational foru m.199 In fact, the ICTY wrote in dicta that an international criminal tribunal " must be endowed with primacy over national courts" because human nature will create a "perennial danger of international crimes being characterized as ordinary crimes."200 In contrast, the Rome Statute does not make any distinction regarding the nature of the charge in the provisions implementing th e princip le of complementarity.
The form of the charge in domestic states does not affect the latitu de that the supranational court must accord natio nal pro cesses.
The de tailed ad mi ss ibility crit eria apply r egard less of th e for m of the charges in the domestic forum or their precise symmetry with the words of the Rome Statute.
At the same time, if a state does not have a criminal code that exactly replicates the range of offenses under the Rome Statute, the ICC prosecutor could be at liberty to simply consider that the state is unable to prosecute the crimes.
It is conceivable that in egregious cases the ICC itself would informally ask a particular state to fill perceived gaps in its domestic legislation, and then determine that the delay in doing so manifested a "genuine unwillingness" to prosecute or investigate a particular accused.
In this vein, states implementing the Rome Statute through domestic legi slati on face an ad di tio nal di lemma.
Legi slati on p endi ng i n sev eral national legislatures to implement the Rome Statute makes general reference to the "crimes described in Articles 6 and 7 and paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Rom e Statu te."201 The Rome Statu te all ow s the pros ecu tor to 198.

States th at duplicate the range of offense in the Rome Statute may very well face pressure to charge an accused in the precise manner that the ICC prosecutor will accept in order to "get credit" for using the domestic judicial system.
Again, such a practice would violate the principle of complementarity contained within the Rome Statute.
The d istinction betw een ord inary offenses and ICC crimes is more than simply a terminological exercise.

In theory, complementarity would require the ICC to recognize the discretion of the domestic authorities regarding the scope and form of the domestic charges.
In reality, complementarity may be an incomplete restraint on a zealous ICC prosecutor, motivated by a strong awareness of moral and leg al obligations to serve the needs of intern ation al accountability, w ho could use the form of domestic charges as a pretext to exert ICC authority.
V. Conclusion "Complementarity" is an intellectually simple concept that masks the deep philosophical and political difficulties that the International Criminal Court must overcome if it is ever to become a functioning institution.
The drafters of the Rome Statute and the delegates who negotiated the Rules of Evidence and Procedure clearly understood that the ICC should not be the court of first resort.
One of the Preparatory Committee Reports prior to the Rome Con feren ce noted that, "[t]aki ng into accou nt that under in ternational law, the exercise of police power and penal law is a prerogative of 201.

States, the jurisdiction of the Court should be viewed only as an exception to such State prerogative."202 If it can function effectively as an apolitical supranational institution with autonomous legal personality, the ICC can fulfill an important function in buttressing domestic justice by serving as an additional forum for di sp en si ng j us ti ce w he n d o mes tic foru ms are i nad eq uat e. D es pi te t h e well-intentioned goals of the Rome Statute, the ICC will survive and thrive only if it manag es to balance the reality o f so vereign political an d legal competitio n between states with th e aspiration for international jus tice.
The complementarity provisions are the designated mechanism for balancing enforcement of international norms against protection of state sovereignty.
Complementarity is in theory an impartial, reliable, and de-politicized process for identifying the cases of international concern, and hence interna tion al ju ri s d ic tion .
Ho we ve r, th e th ick et o f su bje ct i ve p ro v isio ns designed to implement complementarity allow s treaty opponents to argue that national justice systems are threatened with displacement at the hands of an unrestrained international prosecutor.
Indeed, one of the fiercest critics of the ICC testified: "Complementarity, like so much else associated with the ICC is simply an assertion, utterly unproven and untested.
Since no one has any actual experience w ith the Court, of course, no one can say with any certainty what will happen."203 Com plem en tarit y w ill be an ess ent ial com po nen t of a fun ctio nin g ICC within a system of sovereign states, but the new institution will face the difficult challenge of eroding the historic reality of unrestrained state discretion w ithout generating a tidal wave of hostility and outright opposition from the community of states.
Complementarity in practice, as distinct from complementarity in principle, will be an essential feature of an ICC that earns a respected role that warrants state support and assistance towards the goal of enhancing the prospects for international accountability and justice.
Time will tell how this important principle is implemented through the decisions and opinions of the ICC and its prosecutor.

The soldier, be he friend or foe, is charged with the protection of the weak and unarmed.
It is the very essence and reason of his being.
When he violates this sacred trust, he not only profanes his entire cult, but threatens the fabric of international society .4 The two preceding quotations reflect what has become a fundamental p recep t o f i n t ern at io n al l aw : t ha t in d i vi d u als c an an d s h ou l d b e h el d accou ntab le for co nd uct w h ich v io lates fu nd amen tal n orms o f in ternational law.
The first quotation, from the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal, ref le cts th e basic doctrine of indivi dual re sponsibility-- tha t al though international law generally regulates the conduct of states, it has developed certain proscriptions applicable to individuals.
This doctrine has become well-settled in international law, and is a basic tenet of the law of war.
The second quote, written by General MacArthur when he approved the death sentence for Japanese General Yamashita, reflects the concept that, when a member of the profession of arms transgresses fundamental restrictions on warrior conduct, the misconduct disgraces the entire profession of arms.
This notion, alth ough solidly grounded in the history of the law of war, seems less understood today than at any time in the history of our armed forces.
Yet it is a critical component of the law of war, for throughout history it has served as the motivation for calling upon warriors to sit in judgment of the misconduct of other warriors.
The issue of war crimes, and the appropriate venue for holding those who commit them individually responsible, recently became a major interest for the international community.
The result has been an almost myopic focus on the creation and utilization of international criminal tribunals to sit in judgment of w arrior misconduct.
Unfortunately, the lack of understa nding of th e basic sentimen t e x pr essed by Gene ral M ac A rt hu r has resulted in virtually no consideration of the propriety of using military tribunals to perform this function.
While the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda have been the scene of widespread law of war violations, the primary response by the international community has been the use of international criminal tribunals, with no participation from the profession of arms.
This stands in stark contrast with the post-World War II response to war crimes.
Although the international war crimes tribunals were the most visible venues for conducting war crimes trials, military courts-martial and other 4.

These numbers clearly suggest that, had the international community not relied upon the use of military tribunals to sit in judgment of war criminals at the end of World War II, it would have been impossible to bring them all to justice.

In July 1999, U.S. forces entered the Yugoslav province of Kosovo under the authority of a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of all necessary means to restore order and stability to th at province.
This was the culmination of a NATO-led military campaign designed to compel Yugo slavia to resp ect certain fundamental rig hts o f Kosov ar A lban ians.
Th is campaign , co up led wit h int en se dip lomati c p res sure, resu lted in a Yugoslav grant of authority for the presence of NATO forces in Kosovo.
Thus began another ground force operation that--although conducted in response to a n "i nv itation" to en ter the ter rit ory of a nother sovereign state--took on all the traditional characteristics of a military occupation.
During the course of the U.S. presence in Kosovo, it is likely that U.S. forces might detain individuals who participated in some of the atrocities that characterized the conflict between the Serbian Armed Forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army.
Because the fighting between these two organizations was considered an armed conflict within the purview of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY), the current wisdom is th at offenders sh ou ld be detain ed pending in di ctm ent by th at trib un al.
Another option is to subject these individuals to the jurisdiction of local criminal tribunals that will be eventually established by the United Nations authority in Kosovo.
But is there a third option? Could these individuals be subjected to a general courts-martial pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)? This article suggests that such a course might not be as radical as it first appears.
Instead, a close analysis of the UCMJ, recent developments in the customary law of war, and the tradition of providing remedies for violations of the law of war, reveals that the time may be right to pursue this course of action.
Consider the following hypothetical.
An infantry squad, deployed as part of the American contingent of the NATO forces in K osovo (KFOR), conducts a routine patrol in the American sector of Yugoslavia and apprehends a Yugoslav lieutenant accused of numerous atrocities.
The alleged crimes include the murder of twenty innocent Kosovar Albanians during th e Kosovo confli ct , a non- international ar med c onflict 6 to which the United States was not a party.
The KFOR commander orders the suspect detained pending an investigation.
The investigation substantiates the allegations.7

"[A] non-international arm ed conflict is distinct from an international arm ed conflict because of the legal status of the entities opposing each other: the parties to the conflict are not sovereign States, but the government of a single State in conflict with one or more armed factions within its territory."
COMMENTARY ON THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF 8 JUNE 1977 TO THE GEN EVA CONVE NTIONS OF 12 AUGU ST 1949, Â¶ 4339 (Yves Sandoz et al. eds., 1987) [hereinafter OFFICIAL COMMENTARY, PROTOCOL II].
The expression "armed conflicts" gives an important indication . . . since i t in tr oduces a m a te ri al cr ite rion: t h e exi st ence of open ho sti lit ie s between armed forces which are organized to a greater or lesser degree.
Internal disturbances and tensions, characterized by isolated or sporadic acts of violence do not therefo re constitute armed co nflicts in a legal sense, even if the government is forced to resort to police forces or even armed units for the purpose of restoring law and order.
Within these limits, non-international armed conflict seems to be a situation in which hostilities break out between armed forces or organized armed groups within a territory of a single State.
Insurgents fighting against the established order wou ld no rm ally seek to overthrow the governm ent in power or alternatively to bring about a secession so as to set up a new state.
Id. at Â¶ 4341.
Although Serbia was involved in the fighting, alongside the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, their involvement did not change the character of the conflict from noninternational to international.
Serbia's involvement was at the behest and with the consent of the Yugoslav govern ment, the legitimate govern ment, and was directed at the Kosovar Albanians, not Yugoslavia.
Thus, there was no state on state conflict, which would cause the conflict to be characterized as an international armed conflict.
The s ame rationale was used to justify Operation Just Cause, the United States invasion of Panama, as a non-international, as opposed to international armed conflict.
This "invasion" on 20 Decem ber 1989 was a t th e request and invitatio n of Pan ama's legitima tely -elected president, President Gullerm o Endara.
"The United States government never recognized Noriega as Panama's legitimate, constitutional ruler."
United States v. Noriega, 117 F.3d 1206, 1211 (1997); see also Eytan Gilboa, The Panama Invasion Revisited: Lessons for the Use of Force in the Post Cold War Era, 110 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY 539, 539 n.4 (1995).
Thus, the conflict between the United States and Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian Defense Force, and the forces loyal to Noriega was not State on State; rather, it was a non-international armed conflict betw een the legitimate Government of Panama and forces assisting the Panamanian Governm ent against insurgents commanded by Manuel Noriega.
But cf. United States v. Noriega, 808 F. Supp. 791 (1992) (holding Manuel Noriega was entitled to Prisoner of War status based on the court's analysis of the invasion of Panama as an Article 2 conflict-- that is, an international armed conflict--despite evidence to the contrary by the Departments of State and Defense).
"The Court finds that General Noriega is in fact a prisoner of war as defined by Geneva III, and as such must be afforded the protections established by the treaty, regardless of the type of facility in which the Bureau of Prisons chooses to incarcerate him."

Additionally: (1) the Kosovo conflict is a non-international armed conflict, also known as an internal armed conflict; (2) the United States was not a party to the conflict; (3) the atrocities were com mitted prior to KFOR's arrival; (4) KFOR's presence in Yugoslavia is not an occupation for purpose of the law of war; and (5) the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (ICTY) has jurisdiction over the offenses.
The non-occupation determination means that the United States is not acting in the role of occupier enforcing local laws or occupation rules mandated by the occupying force.

Although many judge advocates, legal scholars, and perhaps even members of Congress might disagree w ith this conclusion,9 analysis of recent developments in the law show s that this conclusion is legally sound.

resolution of this issue will ultimately depend upon a judicial determination of the jurisdiction of the court over the accused.
The authority to subject such an accused to a general court-martial is found in Article 18 of the UCMJ, which governs the jurisdiction of general courts-martial.
Article 18 provides in relevant part: "General courts-martial also have jurisdiction to try any person who by the law of war is subject to trial by a military tribunal and may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war."12 As evident from this language, the grant of jurisdiction is not limited by the nationality of the accused, the nationality of the vi cti m, th e mi lit ary s tat us of th e accu sed , th e part ies t o t he co nfl ict in which the offense was committed, or the time when the offense was committed.

The expression "violations of the laws or customs of war" [referring to Article 3 of the ICTY Statute] is a traditional term of art used in the past, w hen concepts of "war" and "laws of warfare" still prevailed, before they were largely replaced by two broader notions: (i) that of "armed conflict," essentially introduced by the 1949 Geneva Conventions; and (ii) the correlative notion of "international law of armed conflict," or the m ore recent and comprehensive notion of "international hum anitarian law," which has emerged as a result of influence of human rights doctrine on the law of arm ed conflict.

the act in question must be a violation of the law of war, and the law of war must provide for individual criminal responsibility for such a violation.
As will be illustrated, developments in the law of war during the past decade place into this categ ory the violation of certain fu ndamental law of war prohibitions applicable to internal armed conflict.
Such violations would satisfy the Article 18 jurisdictional prerequisites, and a jurisdictional basis therefore exists to court-martial the accused in the hypothetical above.
II.
Overview This article examines th e jurisdiction granted by UCMJ Article 18 and the law of war applicable to purely internal armed conflicts to determine whether Article 18 establishes jurisdiction to prosecute non-U.S. partic i p a n t s in suc h c o n f l i c t s f o r s e r i ou s v i ol a tio ns o f i n t e r n a tio na l humanitarian law.
It illustrates that the proscriptions of th e law of war, those which result in individual criminal responsibility when violated during an internal armed con fl ict, fall w ith in th e j urisd ictio nal pu rv iew o f Article 18.
Such violations constitute violations of paragraph 1 of Common Arti cle 3 of th e Genev a Con vent ion s of 1 949 13 (Comm on A rticl e 3(1)) and paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 4 of Protocol II to the 1977 Protoco ls Addi tional to t he G eneva Conventio ns of 19 49 (Protocol II).14 By demonstrating that these law of war proscriptions are fundamental prohibitio ns that have attained customary intern ational law status, this article will show that they fall under the umbrella of universal jurisdiction.
It also examines the relationship between Article 18 and the War Crimes Act of 1996,15 concluding that--although Congress has provided for the federal criminal prose cution of certain war c rimes co m mitted during in tern al armed conflict--the War Crimes Act should not be regarded as preempting the jur isdic ti on gran te d by A rticle 18.
F ina lly, afte r e s ta blishing the authority granted by Article 18, and therefore the permissibility of relying on this source of jurisdiction to subject a n on-U.S. service memb er to a general court-martial, this article considers policy concerns related to any decision to exercise such jurisdiction, focusing on the potential advantages and disadvantages.
Any person who commits a serious violation of the la w of war, a violation resulting in individual criminal responsibility under existing international law, is subject to prosecution at a general court-martial.
Violations of Common Article 3(1) and Protocol II, Articles 4(1) and 4(2), qualify as serious violations of the law of war that subject the violator to prosecution at a general court-martial.
Pursuant to the plain meaning of Article 18 of
