for a positive number C (depending on y ) and sufficiently large N .
This in itself establishes the transcendency of a class of reals n0 1/2f (n) where the integer-valued function f grows sufficiently fast; say, faster than any fixed power of n. By these methods we re-establish the transcendency of the KempnerÂ­Mahler n number n0 1/22 , yet we can also handle numbers with a substantially denser occurrence of 1's.
Though the number z = n2 has too high a 1's density for application of our cenn0 1/2 tral result, we are able to invoke some rather intricate numbertheoretical analysis and extended computations to reveal aspects of the binary structure of z 2 .
1.
Intro duction Research into the statistical character of digit expansions is often focused on the concept of normality.
We call a real number b-normal if its base-b digits are random in a certain technical sense (see [31], [21]
Qualitatively speaking, b-normality requires every string of k consecutive base-b digits to occur, in the limit, 1/bk of the time, as if the digits are generated by tossing a "fair" b-sided die.
In spite of the known fact that almost all numbers are b-normal (in fact almost all are absolutely normal, meaning b-normal for every base b = 2, 3, . . . ) not a single, shall we say "genuine" fundamental constant such as , e, log 2 is known to be b-normal for any b. Artificially constructed normals are known, such as the 2-normal binary Champernowne number [9] C2 = (0.11011100101110 . . .
)2 , obtained by sheer concatenation of the binary of positive integers.
Previous research that motivates the present work includes [3], where a certain "Hypothesis A" relevant to chaotic maps is shown to imply 2-normality of , log 2, (3); and [4]
Intriguing connections with yet other fields--such as ergodic theory--are presented in [22].
Of interest for the present work is that all real algebraic irrationals are widely believed--shall we say suspected--to be absolutely normal (and this belief is at least a half-century old; see for example [6, 7]).
This suspicion is based on numerical and visual evidence that the digit expansions of algebraics do appear empirically "random."
Yet again, the mathematical situation is as bleak as can be: Not a single algebraic real is known to be b-normal, nor has a single algebraic real irrational been shown not to be b-normal; all of this regardless of the base b. Though we expect every irrational algebraic real is absolutely normal, for all we know it could even

be that some algebraics are absolutely abnormal, i.e. not b-normal for any b whatsoever (absolutely abnormal numbers do exist; see [28]).
Herein we focus on the binary scenario b = 2, and though we do not achieve normality results per se, we establish useful lower bounds on the occurrence of 1-bits in positive algebraics.
Our central result is that if y is a real algebraic of degree D 
.
To achieve this bound we borrow ideas from additive number theory; in particular we employ the notion of additive representations.
This notion is combined with our own bounds on the count of 1-bits resulting from binary operations, and also with previous observations on "BBP tails" that arise from arbitrary left-shifts of infinite series.
In Section 6 we define and elaborate on BBP tails.
Irrational numbers y for which #(|y |, N ) cannot achieve the above bound for any degree D are necessarily transcendental.
In this way we easily reestablish the transcendency of the KempnerÂ­Mahler number M= n0
1 , 22 n
first shown to be transcendental by Kempner [19], but the transcendency cannot be established directly from the celebrated ThueÂ­SiegelÂ­Roth theorem on rational approximations to algebraics (there are interesting anecdotes concerning Mahler's approach to such an impasse, including his results on p-adic ThueÂ­Siegel theory and his functional methods; see [26, 27, 29]
Incidentally, the number M above is sometimes called the Fredholm number, but this attribution may be historically erroneous [35].
(See also [1] for more on the number M .)
We can also handle numbers having a higher density of 1's than does M .
For example, by our methods the Fibonacci binary X= n0
1 2 F n
having 1's at Fibonacci-number positions 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 . . . is transcendental.
Now X was proved transcendental some decades ago [27] and explicit irrationality measures and certain continued-fraction properties are known for X [36]
In the present treatment, we can handle numbers like X but where the growth of the exponents is more general than the classic growth of the Fn .

D. H. Bailey, J. M. Borwein, R. E. Crandall, C. Pomerance
With our central result we establish the transcendency of numbers whose 1-bits are substantially more dense than in the above examples, an example of such a "denser" number being 1 n3
2
nlog
log n
.
Incidentally, in the late stages of the present research pro ject we found that this notion of "digital thinking" to establish results in analysis had been foreshadowed by a specific, pedagogical proof by M. Knight [20] that for any base b 
is transcendental (note that b = 2 gives the number M above).
The author used terms such as "islands" for flocks of digits guarded on both sides by enough zeros to avoid carry problems when integral powers of a real number are taken.
As will be seen, such notions pervade also our own treatment; however our results pertain to general 1-bit densities and not to specific real numbers.
Other historical foreshadowings of our approach exist [34] [25]
(See also our Section 11 on open problems.)
Aside from transcendency results, we can employ the central theorem to establish bounds on the algebraic degree.
For example, we shall see that 1 , 2nk 1 2pk
n0
p prime
must have algebraic degrees at least k , k + 1 respectively.
(In this context we think of a transcendental number as having infinite degree.)
Thus for 2 example, 1/2p must be an at-least-cubic irrational.
There are interesting numbers that do not fall under the rubric of our central theorem, such as the "borderline" case: z= n0
1 1 = n2 2 2
1+
3
1 2
,
where 3 is the standard Jacobi theta function.
The problem is that #(z , N ) N , so our central theorem does not give any information on the algebraic degree of z .
Yet we are able to use further number-theoretical analysis--notably the theory of representations of integers as sums of two squares--to establish quadratic irrationality for z .
We further argue, on the basis of such analysis, that z 2 has almost all 0's, and more precisely that the 1's count through the N -th bit position has a certain asymptotic behavior.
Incidentally the number z , being essentially the evaluation of a theta function at an algebraic argument, is known to be transcendental

by other methods [30, 5, 12].
We stress that our binary approach is an apparently new way to look at such issues.
2.
Additive representations For any real nonnegative number x we consider the binary expansion x = (. . . x-3 x-2 x-1 x0 .
x1 x2 x3 . . .
)2 .
The assignment of (finitely many) nonpositive indices for bits xi to the left of the decimal (or if you will, binary) point is a convenience, for we shall, of course, be concentrating a great deal on the bits to the right.
We adopt the convention that no x can end with infinitely many successive 1's, and this forces uniqueness of the binary expansion.
Next we denote the 1's-position set of x by P (x) = {p : xp = 1}, and further define r1 (x, p) = 1 if xp = 1, else 0.
(The rationale for the notation "r1 " will be momentarily evident.)
Now the number of 1-bits through bit position N inclusive is #(x, N ) = mN
r1 (x, m) = pP (x), pN
1.
Note that when x is a nonnegative integer, #(x, 0) is the number 1's of in x. So for example #(7, 0) = 3.
On the other hand, for x = 2 = (1.011010100 . . .
)2 , say, we have #(x, 0) = 1, #(x, 5) = 4, and so on.
We next introduce the representation count rd (x, n) = #{(p1 , . . . , pd ) P d : p1 + Â· Â· Â· + pd = n}, just as in additive number theory where one studies representations of integers n as sums of primes, or squares, and so on.
It is evident that rd can be expressed as an acyclic convolution: rd (x, n) = i+j =n
r
d-1
(x, i)r1 (x, j ).
We shall also employ a step-function on integers r, namely H (r) = 1 if r 
Thus H (rd (n)) = 1 signifies that n has at least one representation p1 + Â· Â· Â· + pd .
For our analysis it is a simple but useful combinatorial observation that the count of representables, call it d (N ) = nN
H (rd (x, n)),
satisfies (1) d (N ) nN
rd (x, n) #(x, N )d .

Also of use will be an attractive relation for positive integral powers of x: xd = n
rd (x, n) .
2n
Unfortunately it is in general extremely difficult to convert partial knowledge of the representation sequence (rd (x, n)) into precise results on the binary expansion of xd .
The problem is that of carry: A summand rd (x, n)/2n possibly causes carry, about lg rd positions to the left, and thus the summands interfere (herein lg x means the base-2 logarithm of x).
It can be said that the goal of the present treatment is the circumvention of this carry problem.
An instructive digression is appropriate here.
With a view to additive number theory, let us define the number G= p prime, o dd
1 2(p-1)/2
= (0.11101101 . . .
)2 .
Note that #(G, N ) = (2N + 2) - 1, where is the standard prime-counting function.
Then r2 (G, N ) is precisely the number of representations of 2N +2 as a sum of two odd primes.
Even if we knew the truth of the Goldbach conjecture--in this scenario, that every N 
For all we know, it could be that the question of irrationality for G2 is more difficult than the Goldbach conjecture itself.
Conversely, it is unclear whether complete knowledge of the binary expansion of G2 would yield results on the celebrated conjecture.
In fact, it is easy to see that r2 (G, N ) is unbounded, so arbitrarily long carries (deposition of bits arbitrarily far to the left of a given position) can be expected.
-n2 intro duced earlier we know Similarly, for the number z = n0 2 that z 4 has a representation sequence (r4 (z 4 , 0), r4 (z 4 , 1), . . . ) of al l positive entries, on the basis of the Lagrange theorem that every nonnegative integer is a sum of four squares.
Here again, little can be gleaned about the binary expansion of z 4 from this perspective, again because of carry.
We study the number z further in Section 9.
Now back to positive powers of x and representation lists.
A sum we later call a "tail component" defined Td (x, R) = m1
rd (x, R + m) , 2m
which we note is 2R times a partial series for the power xd , can be bounded via combinatorial observations, as in

Theorem 2.1.
For x (1, 2) (whether algebraic or not) and d 1 we have n+d-1 rd (x, n) . d-1 Moreover, for the sum Td defined above, we have for 0 R N the upper bound (R + d)d (N + d)d Td (x, R)

Proof.
From the convolution rd (x, n) = i+j =n

Thus Td (x, R) Ud (R) where Ud (R) = m1

This expression is seen to satisfy the recurrence relation Ud (R) = 2Ud-1 (R) + R+d-1 , d-1
which can be used to establish a finite form for Ud : d-1
Ud (R) = j =0
R+d . j
So we have Ud (R) 
d-1 R+d
n
=
(R + d)d . (d - 1)!(R + 1)
Thus, the first bound follows.
The bound on the sum Td is simply obtained by summing the first bound over the stated range of R. Remark.
The finite form for Ud (R) noted above is a polynomial in R with nonnegative coefficients and with main term Rd-1 /(d - 1)!, so that this expression is not only a lower bound for Ud (R), but is also equal to

it asymptotically.
Moreover, it is possible to express Ud (R) as a hypergeometric integral: Ud (R) = (R + d)! R!(d - 1)! 1 0
(2 - x)d-1 xR dx.
We admit that the bounds of Theorem 2.1 and the present remark are actually stronger than what we need here; however, such stronger bounds could be useful in future research.

Preliminary b ound on 1's density Let x be a real algebraic irrational.
The ThueÂ­SiegelÂ­Roth theorem [33] says that for any

Furthermore, for sufficiently large k , the interval k ,k 2+ always contains a 1's position.
Final ly, the 1's count through sufficiently large position n satisfies #(x, n) 
Proof.
When x is irrational, P (x) is an infinite set, so arbitrarily large p can be chosen, with 1 2 x- 
Now the sum is a rational a/b with b = 2pi , and so the first inequality of the theorem is clearly satisfied if pi is large enough.
The rest of the conclusions are immediate from said inequality.

There is a curious aspect to Theorem 3.1, namely, however weak the bounds on 1's counts may be, there is a crucial juncture in what follows (the central Theorem 7.1) where we need Theorem 3.1 to assail the ubiquitous problem of carry propagation.
4.
Bounds for binary evaluations For nonnegative integers n we have defined #(n, 0) as the number of 1's in the binary expansion of n.
We proceed to give convexity relations on binary evaluations, i.e. on sums and products of integers, starting with some simple observations: Lemma 4.1.
For integers n 
Proof.
The first inequality follows from the observation that the total number B (n) of bits in n (counting 0's and 1's) satisfies 2B (n)-1 n, and #(n, 0) B (n).
The second statement is obvious (left-shifting by j bits introduces no new 1's).
The third statement follows by the simple rule of add-with-carry.
This lemma leads to Theorem 4.2 (Convexity relations).
For nonnegative integers m, n we have upper bounds on the 1's counts of evaluations, as #(m + n, 0) #(m, 0) + #(n, 0), #(mn, 0) #(m, 0)#(n, 0).
Proof.
The first, additive relation follows by repeated application of the last equality of Lemma 4.1, one application for each 1-bit of m, say.
The second, multiplicative relation follows in similar fashion, by writing mn = ( 2-p )n, where p runs through the 1's positions of m, and using the second (shift) relation of Lemma 4.1.

It would greatly enhance the present study if we on the 1's counts of binary evaluations.
The a program can be exemplified in several ways. torization of the 7-th Fermat number, namely binary:

which display dashes any hope of a useful, unconditional lower bound on #(mn, 0).
Also interesting is this: If a Mersenne number p = 2q - 1, with q prime, say, is a product of two prime factors, say p = f g , then the convexity Theorem 4.2 implies #(f , 0)#(g , 0) 
For example, 211 - 1 = 23 Â· 89 and each factor has four 1's; sure enough 4 Â· 4 
But for the present study on real numbers, there is a more telling disappointment in regard to lower bounds on 1's densities of products.
Consider two sets of integers: S = {n 0 : n T = {n 0 : n - 2j
= 0} = {0, 2, 8, 10, 32, 34, 40, 42, . . . },
-2j +1
= 0} = {0, 1, 4, 5, 16, 17, 20, 21, . . .
} = S/2,
so that elements of S, T have 0-bits in all even, odd positions respectively.
Now define associated real numbers: 1 1 , xT = . xS = 2s 2t sS tT
It is not hard to show that both of these real-numbers have "square-root" 1's densities, that is both #(xS , N ), #(xT , N ) are roughly of order N , so that both xS , xT are irrational; in fact the sum xS + xT is irrational, since the intersection of the S, T sets is just {0} and so there is only one trivial carry for the sum.
However, all of this having been said, it turns out amazingly enough that one has rational product xS xT = 2 = (10.0000 . . .
)2 , which reveals that two numbers each with square-root 1's density can have an extremal 1's density, in this case a zero density because of carry.
By looking at the representation counts for integers in S + S one may show x2 , x2 , hence (since 2xS xT = 4) also (xS + xT )2 are irrational.
In any case, S T we shall bable to handle certain real numbers whose 1's count is genuinely e less than N .

This relation will next be applied to algebraic numbers whose minimum integer polynomial has all coefficients (except A0 ) nonnegative.
5.
Application of binary-evaluation b ounds Our strongest bounds on 1's density will be obtained for the class of real algebraic irrationals for which the coefficients of the minimum integer polynomial are nonnegative, except for the constant term.
We begin with Lemma 5.1.

Note that x (1, 2) and because x is a shift of y , the counts #(x, N ), #(y , N ) differ only by an integer constant, so we may concentrate on x. Observe that A0 is a negative integer.
From Lemma 5.1 we can select N and assign i = 2N x so that xd = id + zd , 2N d

But this d=1 means for some constant C (also independent of N ) that the integer YN has more than N - C 1-bits.

Assuming y d is rational then for x = y /2 lg y there is a polynomial Axd - B , with positive integers A, B .

The concept of BBP tail comes from the BaileyÂ­BorweinÂ­Plouffe formalism [2], whereby one may rapidly compute isolated bits of certain binary expansions--such as for , log 2 --by rapid computation of the integer I (x, R) and rigorous control of the "tail" T (x, R).
Remarkably, it is a fact that for the algebraic x in question, T (x, R) is always an integer, for the simple reason that T (x, R) = -2R A0 - I (x, R).
To facilitate further analysis, we shall require a bound on the average absolute value of the tails T (x, R) in terms of one value of #(x, N ): Lemma 6.1.
Let x be an algebraic number in (1, 2) of degree D 
Let N 2D and set K = 2D lg N .

We shall use Lemma 6.1 to show that if #(x, N ) is small, then not too many values of T (x, R) are positive.
Counter to this, the following lemma gives conditions on when there are many positive tails T (x, R).

As the 0-bit of x is 1 it follows that rd (x, N ) rd-1 (x, N ) for d 2.
Thus the hypothesis implies that for each d = 1, 2, . . . , D - 1 we have rd (x, R) = 0 for each integer R (R0 , R1 ].

As in the proof of Theorem 5.2, we use the normalized algebraic x (1, 2), observing that #(x, N ), #(|y |, N ) differ only by an integer constant, so again we may concentrate on the bit-counting for x.
Suppose #(x, N ) cN 1/D .
Then from (1) applied for d = D - 1, and the fact that each rD-1 (x, R) is a nonnegative integer, we have that the number of integers R N with rD-1 (x, R)

Finally, for the arbitrary positive we set = 1 - (1 + /2)-1/D to obtain the statement of the theorem.

Implications of the central theorem Theorem 7.1 can be used to establish transcendency of a class of binary expansions, as in Theorem 8.1.
Let a function f : R R be strictly monotonic increasing, with f attaining integer values for integer arguments.
If for any 
(y ) = O(y ) 1 2 f (n)
is transcendental.
Proof.
Note that the bit positions f (n) are distinct, so the observation f -1
(N ) = #{n 
means #(x, N ) = O(N ), which for algebraic x is incompatible with Theorem 7.1.
Corollary 8.2.
For any real

is transcendental.
So the KempnerÂ­Mahler number M = m2 and the Fibonacci binary involving the Fibonacci numbers (Fn ) = (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . .
) 1 X= Fn 2 n0
are transcendental.
Final ly, there are transcendental numbers of stil l greater 1-bit densities, such as 1 .
Y= nlog log n 2 n3 Remark.
Recall that the ThueÂ­SiegelÂ­Roth implication Theorem 3.1 handles 
Proof.
As for m , take n0 = - log( - 1)/ log so that there is a strictly monotone function whose ineteger evaluations are f (n) = n+n0 , with f -1 (N ) = O(log N ), so that Theorem 8.1 applies and the partial binary sum for m starting from index n0 , hence m itself, is transcendental.
As for the Fibonacci binary, n-th Fibonac number can be written the ci f (n) = ((1 + )n - (- )n ))/ 5, where = ( 5 - 1)/2, so the growth of 1's positions is essentially that of m1+ and again incompatible with Theorem 7.1 if X is assumed algebraic.
For the number Y it is evident that #(Y , N ) N 1/ log log N which is of slower growth than any positive power of N .
We can also use Theorem 7.1 to generate results on algebraic degrees for certain constants, as in the following (as before let us stipulate that the algebraic degree of a transcendental is ): Theorem 8.3.
For positive integer k the number 1 Xk = 2nk n0 has algebraic degree at least k , while the number 1 Pk = 2pk p prime has algebraic degree at least k + 1.
Proof.
In the first case, #(Xk , N ) = #{nk N } 
In the second case we have #(Pk , N ) = #(pk N ) = (N 1/k ) 
Thus for example neither P2 nor X3 is a quadratic irrational.
The case of 2 X2 is just the previously mentioned number z = 1/2n , on which number we focus attention in the next section.

where now we are using the standard notation of r2 (n) for the number of representations n = a2 + b2 for a, b Z, counting sign and order.
It will be convenient therefore to study z , from which algebraic properties of z follow.
Incidentally z 2 has some interesting numerological features; for one thing it is very close to / log 2; in fact the approximation z 2

can be obtained via Jacobi -transformation, and remarkably is correct to the implied 23 decimal places in the above display.
It is fascinating that such relations between z 2 and fundamental constants exist even though, as we shall prove, almost all of the binary bits of z 2 are 0's.
It is one of the earliest results in additive number theory, due to Jacobi, that r2 (n) = 4 d|n,d o dd
(-1)(
d-1)/2
.
It turns out that the representation count r2 (n) is positive if and only if every prime p 3(mod 4) dividing n does so to an even power.
Thus, the representation sequence (r2 (0), . . . ) has zeros in any position n = 3k with (3, k ) coprime, and so on.
Deeper results on r2 include the fact that the number of representable integers not exceeding N behaves according to the Landau theorem: N , H (r2 (n)) L log N nN

This form is reminiscent of the Erd osÂ­Borwein number 1 d(m) E= = , n-1 2 2m n

The constant E was proven irrational by Erd [13] who used number-theoretical arguments os (outlined in [4]
Later the irrationality of such forms was established via PadÂ´ approximants, e by P. Borwein [8].
What we shall show is that z is not a quadratic irrational, and so neither is z .
In one sense this is stronger than the quoted irrationality results for the number E .
On the other hand, it is already known that theta functions at algebraic arguments, hence z , z , are transcendental [5, 12].
To effect our nonquadratic-irrationality proof, we shall follow the same basic prescription as for Theorem 7.1; namely, we establish upper bounds on the size of representations, and employ some knowledge of zero-runs.
As for upper bounds, it is known [17] that for any fixed

Corollary 9.2.
For integer n sufficiently large, the interval (n2 , n2 + n) contains a zero-run of the r2 representation of length at least u (n).
Proof.
Take x = n/3 in Theorem 9.1.
Then for relevant M and a, the position n2 + (a + 1 + M - (n2 mod M )) n2 + 2n/3 is the start of a zero-run of length u (n/3) u (n), which run for sufficiently large n is contained in (n2 , n2 + n).

By Corollary 9.2, for sufficiently large n, these positions are in order, with a zero-run length Z = u (n2 ) , so that (r2 (n4 + f + 1), . . . , r2 (n4 + f + Z )) is a length-Z zero-vector.

Theorem 9.4.
Almost al l bits of z 2 are 0's; in fact the 1's-count has asymptotic behavior N #(z 2 , N ) C0 , log N for an absolute constant C0 0.7996 . . . (we give a formula for C0 in the proof ).
Clearly, Theorem 9.4 implies that z 2 is irrational (because of arbitrarily long zero-runs), and Theorem 9.3 may well follow also from the asymptotic 1's density (although see Section 11).
Incidentally the asymptotic density also holds for z 2 , as follows from a slight modification (actually simplification) of the proof.
In spite of the paucity of 1's for these squared numbers, higher powers such as z 3 , z 4 are likely 2-normal.
Indeed, all such higher powers will involve interfering carries.
For example, it is known that r3 (n) 
The proof of Theorem 9.4 is based on the following two lemmas.
Lemma 9.5.
There is an absolute constant c such that for any integers N , B 2, the number of integers n N with r2 (z , n) 
Lemma 9.6.
For any positiventegers B , N , the number of integers n N i with r2 (z , n) B is at most ( N + 1)2 /B .
Note that Lemma 9.6 is very easy.
The assertion follows instantly from 2 the inequality nN r2 (z , n) ( N + 1) .
We p ostp one the pro of of Lemma 9.5 until later.
First we see how Theorem 9.4 follows from the lemmas.
Proof.
(Theorem 9.4.)
Let b(m) = #(m, 0) denote the number of 1's in the binary representation of the nonnegative integer m, and let b(0) = 0.
It follows from Theorem 4.2 and the fact that r2 (z , n) no(1) that for N large, #(z 2 , N ) nN +log N
b(r2 (z , n)).
The goal is to get a similar-looking lower bound.
Let SN denote the set of natural numbers n N such that n is not a square and r2 (z , n)

We conclude from these estimates that appearing in the bit stream for z 2 we see intact all of the bits of the numbers r2 (z , n) for n SN , when N is large.
Thus, we have for large N that #(z 2 , N ) nS N
b(r2 (z , n)).
It follows from the lemmas that the number of integers n N with r2 (z , n) 
The number of 1-bits contributed to #(z 2 , N ) from n N with n SN and r2 (z , n)

.
And, by Lemma 9.6 there are at most O(N/2(log N ) ) values of n N 1/4 with r2 (z , n) 
Since b(r2 (z , n)) = o(log n), the contribution of these values of n to #(z 2 , N ) is also o(N/ log N ).
It follows that #(z 2 , N ) = nN
b(r2 (z , n)) + o(N/
log N ).
Binary expansions
25
Using the identity z 2 = 4z 2 - 4z + 1 and that r2 (n) = 4r2 (z , n) when n is not a square, and r2 (n) = 4r2 (z , n) - 4 0 when n is a positive square, we further see that #(z 2 , N ) = nN
b(r2 (n)) + o(N/
log N ).
Hence it is sufficient to estimate this last sum.
Suppose n = n1 n2 n3 where ni is the largest divisor of n composed of primes that are congruent to i (mod 4).
We have r2 (n) 
And if n3 is a square, then r2 (n)/4 = d(n1 ), where d is the standard divisor function.
It follows that if n3 is a square and if g (n) denotes the largest squarefull divisor of n1 then r2 (n)/d(g (n)) is a power of 2, so that b(r2 (n)) = b(d(g (n))).
Incidentally by squarefull is meant an integer none of whose prime factors appears to the power 1.
We now count the number Tg (N ) of integers n N with r2 (n) 
It is not too difficult to see that Tg (N ) L where = p 1 mo d 4

where g runs over the squarefull integers divisible solely by primes that are congruent to 1 (mod 4).
Note that this sum is convergent, which convergence partially justifies the adding of the asymptotic relations for Tg (N ).
We do not give a proof of the asymptotic relations for Tg (N ), but these can be achieved as corollaries of the Landau asymptotic formula.
In Section

D. H. Bailey, J. M. Borwein, R. E. Crandall, C. Pomerance
10 we give numerical verification of Theorem 9.4.
We close the present section with a proof of Lemma 9.5.
Proof.
(Lemma 9.5.)
Let r (n) denote the number of coprime representations of n as the sum of two squares.
First we count the number of integers n N for which r (n) 
Note that for r (m) to be positive it is necessary that m is not divisible by any prime congruent to 3 (mod 4), that is, that m3 = 1.
(This condition is almost sufficient: to make it sufficient it should also be the case that m2 , the 2-power in m, is not a power of 4.)
For a given integer k 
where c is an absolute constant and where is defined in the proof of Theorem 9.4.
(Actually one can have the smaller factor (d3 ), but this is unimportant.)
Since (k ) = O(B ), k B
as is easily seen by elementary methods (see [17], Ch. 18), it follows that the number of n N with r (n) 
This proves the lemma for the function r .
To get it for r2 (z , n) we generalize the above proof for the case u2 |n, v 2 |n + k , where uv is divisible only by primes that are congruent to 3 (mod 4) and where r (n/u2 ) 
For any fixed choice for u, v we get an estimate of O( (k )N/(u2 v 2 log N )) for the number of such n N .
Now we sum over k , u, v getting the lemma.
10.
Numerical exp eriments for C0 The intricacies of the borderline number z and its powers show that global bit-density arguments alone are insufficient to handle low 1's-density cases: We required number theory to focus on certain details of the bit pattern.
Later in the research, we found that computational aspects--such as bit-counting--for z 2 are nontrivial.
In attempts to verify Theorem 9.4 empirically--in particular, to justify the value of C0 --the present authors were met with considerable computational consternation.
There are two basic difficulties that need be overcome.
Note that calculation of C0 from the sum formula is not too hard, and gives us the cited 0.7996 . . . value that we obtained by summing over squarefull g 105 , 106 , 107 in succession, then extrapolating on the assumption of a reasonable form for the series-truncation error.
The remaining difficulties all pertain to the actual counting of representations up through some large n.
Binary expansions
27
The first difficulty is that the Landau asymptotic formula is, for all practical purposes, generally below the mark, in the sense that a more accurate formula, also due to Landau, is [23] H (r2 (n)) = L nN
N log N

C1 log N
+o
N (log N )3
/2
,
where C1 = 0.5819 . . . is yet another constant.
One might also use the Ramanujan form [18] N
H (r2 (n)) L nN 0
dx log x
which is reminscent of the logarithmic integral Li(x) which, as is well known, stands as a better approximation to (x) than the classic x/ log x. Remark ably, for the original Landau expression LN/ log N to be accurate to say 1 per cent of an empirical count of representables, one has to go up to about N = e50 1022 , or about a mole of bits.
That is more than the digital storage presently available on the entire planet.
The second computational difficulty is that the proof of Theorem 9.4 basically tells us that most r2 values eventually "separate" so that carries do not interfere.
When does separation become significant? A very rough heuristic runs as follows.
For very large the mean separation beN tween positive representation counts is about log N /L, and this should be greater than the base-2 logarithm of the largest r2 values of the region.
So, and again this is quite heuristic, for significant separation we should have log N 2 , log log N L which leads to the estimate of N 1080 bits, which is an oft-quoted estimate on the number of protons in the visible universe.
So these difficulties required the authors to calculate entities that converge to reasonable values for N well below the aforementioned astronomical thresholds.
It turns out that the quantity C (N ) = L nN nN
b(r2 (n)) C0 H (r2 (n))
is relatively well-behaved, and gives an excellent empirical value for C0 (although, still, N has to be taken painfully far and extrapolation techniques were required when our machinery reached its limit, as described below).
Notice that this quantity C (N ) essentially measures--up to the L factor--the number of bits per positive representation.
The numerical results reported below suggest (and Theorem 9.4 implies) an amusing principle: The average number of bits in a positive representation count r2 (n)
28
D. H. Bailey, J. M. Borwein, R. E. Crandall, C. Pomerance
is about C0 /L = 1.05.
That is, it is a very good bet that a random positive r2 value is a power of 2.
In order to calculate entities for n up to and beyond say 108 , we employed a sieving expedient described in [11] for rapidly obtaining long strings of representation counts.
The algorithm is quite simple: (1) Create N + 1 bins, say B [0], . . . , B [N ]
In the following table we denote by r2 the sum of counts r2 (n) through n = N , by H the count of representables, by c2 the number of r2 (n) being a power-of-two, and by b the sum of all bit counts b(r2 (n)): N 106 107 108 LN/ log N 205605.6 1903573.9 17805966.8 H 216342 1985460 18457848 r2 3141552 31416028 314159056 c2 204082 1877532 17482500 b 228646 2093748 19436147 #(z 2 , N ) 213480 1968680 18353248 C (N ) 0.807683 0.805901 0.804725
Note the following interesting features of this table.
The 1st-order Landau estimate (2nd column) indeed lags behind the representation count H. Next, the similarity of r2 and the decimal digits of is, of course, not a coincidence: The celebrated Gauss circle problem starts with the proven estimate r2 = N + o(N ), whence one focuses attention on the little-o term.
Thus the present sieve technique for counting representations might be useful in numerical studies of the circle error.
We see that indeed all but a few per cent of representables are a power-of-two (i.e., c2 is close to H ).
We stress that the #(z 2 , N ) column comes from processing of the r2 with carry.
Actually, rather than work out the carry chain for the B [ ] bins, we instead obtained the # column by simply squaring high-precision z values.
For both sheer arithmetic of that sort, or for our divisor-sieve, our machinery was not able to go up to N = 109 .
Incidentally this is not because of CPU power--the sieve is quite fast, as are convolution methods of squaring reals--the problem is memory.
Thus we are forced to extrapolate from the last column of data.
Under Romberg extrapolation and the assumption of exponential approach, we estimate the final column's limit to be about 0.802.
This extrapolation is within 0.3 per cent of the theoretical C0 = 0.7996 . . . and so we deem this numerical exercise successful.
We should also mention that the C (N ) results, when other N values are

included in a larger table, are remarkably smooth, which in itself suggests the validity of extrapolation.
11.
Op en problems Finally, we state some open problems: Â· Is there a quantifiable sense in which the binary representation of 2 is not truly random? That is, we observe using the present techniques, that the representation list (r2 ( 2, 0), . . . , r2 ( 2, N )) for large N cannot have any zero-run of more than 2 lg N consecutive zeros.
Evidently this is a hard constraint that one would not want to put on the representation sequence for a "truly random" bit generator.
Â· As for the Fibonacci binary X of Corollary 8.2, what is the 1's density of X 2 ? Â· What can be said ab t Fourier representations and bit densities? ou For example, for x = 2 the simple fact of x2 = 2 can be recast as 2 1 2 ipt dt e , 2= p -1 e-2 it 2 1-2 0 pP (x)
where (0, 1) is a free parameter, and in principle such an integral representation should convey some information about the 1's positions p in the expansion of 2.
Â· For bases b 
What kinds of bounds might be placed on counts of 1's and 2's for ternary expansions of algebraic numbers? Â· We have mentioned that the nonquadratic-irrationality Theorem 9.3 may well follow from the density Theorem 9.4.
But there is an impasse which would have to be overcome.
Namely, it turns out that, whereas #(z , N ) N , there exist reals y with much greater than the square-root 1's density but such that stil l we have #(z + y , N ) N .
That is, adding y to z does not improve the 1's count.
To see this, define 2k n - 1 y= 2n2 n
When z is added to such a y , the sets of kn 1's are each obliterated by carry.
This is an impasse because one cannot just infer the 1's density of Az 2 + B z merely by observing that the (rather high) density in Theorem 9.4 dominates the N density.
Â· The C0 constant of Theorem 9.4 we have estimated as 0.7996 . . . .
A fast algorithm for calculating the Landau constant L itself is given

in [14].
(In doing so, they effectively solved research Problem 1.88 of [10], which asks for a fast method.)
Might there be a similar, fast construction for C0 ? Â· In recent times has emerged the field of "experimental mathematics," wherein one uses high-precision numerical relations such as linear reduction to suggest exact algebraic identities, in this way igniting a profusion of new results and theorems.
One might say that the results of the present paper amount to a kind of "digitally motivated analysis" (we might abbreviate DMA), in which computers were not used (except to check various claims), yet results in the analysis field are obtained by thinking digitally, in our case thinking in binary.
(And, we acknowledge the historical foreshadowing of "DMA", as in [24, 20, 34, 25].)
A question, then, would be: What other aspects of analysis apart from transcendency might succumb to the "DMA" approach?
