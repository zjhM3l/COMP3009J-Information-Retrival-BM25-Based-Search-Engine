Watersheds include Red Clover and Little Grizzly Creeks, tributaries to Indian Creek and the North Fork of the Feather River, and Big Grizzly Creek, tributary to the Middle Fork of the Feather River in Sierra Valley via Lake Davis, a domestic water supply for the community of Portola.
Little Grizzly Creek is sterile due to inflow from the abandoned Walker Mine.
The forest type varies with increasing elevation from ponderosa and Jeffrey pine to mixed conifer and to red fir.
The area has a low potential for large, damaging fires: numerous small lightning fires have occurred.
It is summer range for the Sloat and Doyle Deer Herds.
There are productive fisheries in most streams, except Little Grizzly Creek.
Goshawk and bald eagles occur within the area.
A bald eagle management zone is included.
Prehistoric and historic cultural resources are common.
No developed recreation sites are provided, but many dispersed hunter camps are present.
Portions of the "Grizzly Mountain".

Description The Lakes Basin Management Area ex ends south f Plumas-Eureka State Park to the Yuba-Feather River drainage divide (the Forest boundary) and is bounded on the east by the Gold Lake Highway.
Most is in Plumas County, but 2.658 acres are in Sierra County.
Prominent features are Gold Lake, Mt. Washington and Mt. Elwell.
The area contains numerous small snow ponds and over twenty lakes, ranging in size from three acres to the 500 acre Gold Lake.
Past glacial action is responsible for much of the topography and for the large amount of smooth, exposed rock.
Topography varies from the steep U-shaped Florentine Canyon in the northwest to a broad, flat glacial moraine in the southeast occupied by Snag and Goose Lakes.
Valleys are separated by sharp peaks and ridges of exposed rock.
Elevations range from 5,200 feet in lower Gray Eagle Creek to 7,812 feet on top of Mt. Elwell, and most of the area is above 6,000 feet.
Soils are thin, rocky and generally highly erodible.
Landslide occurrence is generally low, due to the dominant glaciated terrain.
The area is drained by Jamison, Smith, Gray Eagle, and Frazier Creeks, tributaries to the Middle Fork of the Feather River.
Long Lake on Gray Eagle Creek provides domestic water for the town of Graeagle.
Vegetation is sub-alpine and varies considerably from thick stands of red fir to dense brushfields with scattered Jeffrey pine on areas of shallow soil.
Numerous small wet meadows and scattered stands of lodgepole pine and aspen are in the wetter areas.
Pockets of mountain hemlock occur on the higher ridges and peaks, and western white pine is scattered throughout.
The area has an equal diversity of wildlife habitat and species.
Most of the lakes and streams contain trout and are heavily fished.
Spotted owl territories are included.
Deer from the Sloat herd summer in the area.
Heavy use for hunting, gathering, tool making, and seasonal camping, occurred in prehistoric times, and evidence is common.
Petroglyphs occur in the Lakes Basin Campground and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Evidence of early mining is present in the area, such as cabins, adits, tailings, machinery, and small dams which formed many of the lakes.
A combination of variable topography and vegetation, numerous lakes and streams, and exposed rock give the area an exceptional visual quality and high recreational value.

Lake Davis District: Description Beckwourth Acreage: 16,462 Total 13,146 or 80% PNF
The Lake Davis Management Area surrounds Lake Davis.
It is entirely within Plumas County.
The major feature of the area is the "lake", a 4.000 acre reservoir of the California Water System formed by damming Big Grizzly Creek in 1966.
Gradual releases provide domestic-use water to Plumas County communities and streamflow to Grizzly Creek and the Middle Fork of the Feather River.
Terrain is slightly sloping near the lake, but very steep and rugged between the Walker Mine Road and Crocker Ridge and between the West Side Road and Three Mile Ridge.
Elevations range from 5,775 feet, the surface elevation of Lake Davis when full, to 7,693 feet at the top of Smith Peak.
Soils have low to moderate erodibility, and risk of instability is dominantly low.
Vegetation is sagebrush with scattered pine on the flat terrain near the lake shore, changing to a dense stand of ponderosa pine and f i r on the steeper slopes and ridges.
Wet stringer meadows surrounded by dense stands of lodgepole pine extend along the major tributary streams on the west side of the lake.
Lake Davis and its tributaries are major trout fisheries.
The surrounding area contains bald eagle, goshawk, and osprey habitat and several known nesting sites.
Waterfowl use the area for nesting in the spring and frequently concentrate in the area during fall migration.
The western portion is within the Smith Peak State Game Refuge.
Evidence exists to indicate use of the area in prehistoric times for hunting, collecting, and seasonal camps and in early historical times for sheep and cattle grazing and railroad logging.
Lake Davis is managed for water-oriented recreation.
Three family campgrounds having a total of 185 camping sites, four boat launching ramps, a sewage dump station, and a visitor information display are provided.
Winter use includes ice fishing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, and snow play, facilitated by the County's plowing of the Grizzly Road.
Use of vehicles off roads and camping outside campgrounds is prohibited between the lake shore and the main roads around the lake.
A major portion of the "Grizzly Valley" allotment, part of the "Humbug" allotment, and all of the "Lake Davis" allotment are in the area.
Timber production continues, but there is no mining activity or known potential for mining.

Beckwourth District: Beckwourth Description The Beckwourth Management Area extends south of Portola and Highway 70 to the Forest boundary between Beckwourth and the C-Road-Clio area in Mohawk Valley.
Southern Portola, Clio, the Middle Fork of the Feather River, and the Union Pacific Railroad lie within the area.
It is entirely within Plumas County.
Private land is concentrated in Mohawk Valley and along County Road Al5 to Portola, including most meadow areas, and is extensive outside of the complex Forest boundary.
Terrain varies from floodplain and canyon of the Middle Fork through moderate slopes to the steep, rocky caprock of Beckwourth Peak.
Elevations range from 4,500 to 7,300 feet.
Soils are dominantly of volcanic origin and are moderately to highly erodible.
Instability risk is low, except on the talus slopes below Beckwourth Peak.
Drainage is northwest into the Middle Fork of the Feather River, or southwest into Sulphur Creek, a tributary.
Vegetation is characteristic of the semi-arid conditions, and mixed conifer stands are dominated by ponderosa and Jeffrey pine.
Due to subdivision development and arson, the frequency of fire has been high.
Flashy fuels are widespread.
The area provides transition range for the Doyle and Loyalton-Truckee deer herds.
An active Prairie Falcon site is near Beckwourth Peak.
The Middle Fork Wild and Scenic River in the area is recreation zone.
The PNF continues to acquire public or ownership of the extensive private property here.

The "Ramelli Ranch" allotment, a portion of the "Beckwourth Peak" allotment, and the "Mlaker" Special Use Pasture are in the area.
The 1700 acre Ramelli Ranch was purchased under the Wild and Scenic River Act to provide rural atmosphere and open space along the river.
It has approximately 200 acres of irrigated pasture now leased for cattle grazing.
Forested areas have been heavily logged since the turn of the century, leaving very little old growth timber.
Many land exchanges have resulted in acquisition of additional heavily logged land.
Because of the lack of old growth timber, only one small timber sale is planned for the near future.
There are no known active mining claims in the area.

Haskell District: Beckwourth Description Acreage: 24,900 Total 15.455 or 63% PNF
The Haskell Management Area extends south from Clio and west from the Gold Lake Highway area to the Forest boundary.
The area is almost split equally between Sierra and Plumas Counties.
Most of Mohawk Valley is private land outside of the Forest boundary.
The M i l l s Peak Haskell Peak ridge is the prominent landmark.
The area is mostly roaded, but access to the lower slopes of this ridge is limited by private ownerships.
-
Terrain consists of flat ridgetops and valley floors with fairly steep intervening slopes.
Elevations range from 4.400 feet to 8,100 feet.
Soils are of volcanic or glacial origin and are moderately erodible.
Instability potential is high in glacial deposits on steep slopes.
Major streams are Frazier, Mohawk, Boulder, Sulphur, and Barry Creeks, all tributary to the Middle Fork of the Feather River.
Mohawk Creek is the domestic water supply for Clio.
Mohawk, Boulder, and Sulphur Creeks are used for irrigation of pastureland in Mohawk Valley.
True fir stands are on the top and north slope of the Mills-Haskell ridge, but south-facing lands to the east support the more arid ponderosa and Jeffrey pine stands.
A l l stands are a mosaic of age and structure because of past management and fire.
Spotted owl territories are located within the area, and approximately 6,500 acres are Sloat deer herd winter range.
Frazier and Sulphur Creek are productive fisheries.
The M i l l s Peak Lookout provides an overview of Mohawk Valley and surrounding terrain.
A self-guided nature trail is near M i l l s Peak.
Recreation is primarily dispersed, and no recreation facilities have been planned.
Mohawk Valley was settled by ranchers around 1870 and the valley pastures are still used for cattle.
The "Mount Haskell" and part of the "Beckwourth Peak" allotments are in this area.
The former is administered by the Tahoe National Forest in conjunction with some adjacent allotments.
Land subdivision is planned for some of the privately-owned meadowlands and low ridges near the McKenzie Ranch.
Timber production is the main use of forested land, and woodcutting activity is moderate.
Placer and lode gold mines of the 1850's are scattered throughout the area, but activity is now limited to the Locke Mine area.

Frenchman District: Description The Frenchman Management Area encompasses the region surrounding Frenchman Reservoir, extending north from the Forest boundary near Chilcoot to the Meadow View Guard Station and east from Dixie Valley to the Honey Lake Escarpment.
Most of the area is in Plumas County, but 1000 acres are in Lassen County.
Subdivided private land is scattered along the three major creeks, curtailing public access to portions of the Forest.
Prominent features are Frenchman Lake, Dixie Mountain, and Adam Peak.
Landform varies from steep-sided volcanic caprock, such as Dixie Mtn..
through moderately-sloped ranges, to flat-lying stringer meadows along major streams.
Elevations range from 4,980 feet to 8,323 feet.
Soils are of volcanic and granitic origin and are moderately to highly erodible.
Instability potential is generally low to moderate except for extremely unstable talus slopes around Dixie Mtn.
Most of the area comprises the watershed of Little Last Chance Creek, a major tributary of the Middle Fork of the Feather River.
Dixie Creek, a tributary of Red Clover Creek, Indian Creek, and ultimately the North Fork of the Feather River, drains a smaller portion of the area.
Vegetation consists of open, broad streamside meadows, bordered with sage-brush, and conifer forest on the slopes.
Tree cover is generally Jeffrey and ponderosa pine with some white and Douglas fir.
The entire area is within the summer range of the Doyle deer herd, and two-thirds is within the Dixie Game Refuge.
The Reconnaissance Peak-Bald Rock area is a prime deer fawning area, and the Snow Lake-Adams Peak area is a key fall and spring transition range for migrating deer.
The west side of Dixie Mountain is suitable for reintroduction of peregrine falcons.
A bald eagle management zone is included.
Several large fires have burned in the area, including the 20,541 acre Bonta Fire in the Reconnaissance Peak - Bald Rock Area in 1931, a 3.000 acre fire in 1966 and again i n 1974.
and the 244 acre Charles fire in 1979.
Frenchman Lake Recreation Area is a central point for recreation activity, and boating, fishing, camping, and day use is heavy.
The area is about one hour from Reno.
The Forest maintains one group and five family campgrounds, one boat launch ramp, several fishing access points, but no hiking trails.

Escarpment District: Description The Escarpment Management Area includes the slope draining northeast into Long and Honey Lake Valleys east of the crest of the Diamond Mountains.
Most of the area is in Lassen County, but there are 4,623 acres in Plumas County.
Prominent features are Adams Peak, Crystal Peak, Sugarloaf, Black Mtn. and Thompson Peak, all peaks along the crest.
Part of the Thompson Peak Roadless area is included.
Terrain consists of steep to very steep slopes.
Elevations range from 4,200 feet to 8,197 feet.
Soils are granitic and highly erodible, and the risk of landslides is generally moderate to high.
Through many small watersheds, all drainage is to Honey Lake.
North exposures support mixed conifer stands with some Douglas fir.
Low volumes of ponderosa and Jeffrey pine occur on south and east exposures.
Understory vegetation is sparse in many areas and consists of manzanita, bitterbrush, sagebrush, mountain mahogany, and scattered black oak.
Fuel types, inaccessibility, and strong winds create a potential for large fires.
Past fires have ranged from 1,200 to 7.700 acres and have sometimes spread downslope.
The area is a transition range and a migration zone of the Doyle deer herd.
The Laufman campground at the foot of the escarpment is the only recreational development.
Much of the area is plainly visible from Highway 395.
Most of the area is transitory cattle range.
Parts of the "Snow Lake", "Hall", "Meadow View", "McQueen", "Downing", "Otis Canyon" and "Humphrey" allotments and all of the "Red Rock", "Crystal Peak" and "Stiles" allotments are present.
Use of several of these is in conjunction with use of BLM and private lands.
A few water transmission lines to downslope ranches and fences and water developments for wildlife and livestock are present.
Most of the easily accessible areas have been logged.
Current salvage and green sales are limited to steep slopes and small volumes.
Over half of the area requires aerial harvest methods such as helicopter or cable systems due to steep slopes and erodible soils.
Mining activity is limited.
