FINDING
While SGISD has a commendable process in place for identifying gifted and talented (G
District staff told the review team that the elementary/middle school program has a certified gifted and talented teacher in every classroom.
These teachers have taken the initial thirty hours of minimum courses required for certification and the six hour continuing education course to remain eligible to teach.
However, the district has addressed limited strategies in their Campus Improvement Plans (CIPs) that challenge the approximately 14 percent advanced and gifted learners of the district.
The objective of the CIP is to increase the TAAS passing rate by three percent using strategies that target special populations of Hispanic, Anglo, and Economically Disadvantaged students and does not mention specific strategies for the gifted and talented population of students.
The Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students provides a long range plan with viable targets that local school districts can strive to attain.
Examples of "recognized" and "exemplary" performance are included in the plan.
Districts following this plan offer additional challenges to this group of students.
Recommendation 8:
Comply with the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students and adopt a five-year plan for the Gifted and Talented Program.
Long-range planning and student evaluation are important components of a successful gifted and talented program.

The district has developed three special work-oriented programs.
The Internship Program is open to qualified seniors and allows them to be matched with an employer who offers an internship in their potential field of study and or career choice.

The Career/Technology Program is a four-year program that begins with basic computer applications and graphic skills and ends with experience in business entrepreneurship.
In addition, the district has an agreement with Coastal Bend Community College to provide concurrent enrollment and dual credit courses as part of the Technology Preparation program.
In school year 1998-99, 117 of 145 Academy High School students participated in the career and technology program.

*SGISD does not receive Compensatory Education funds.
Special Education
The Federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 requires school districts to provide certain education-related health services to children with disabilities, and to develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for each child.
The IEP is a written plan based on a student's abilities and educational needs that addresses long-term goals and short-term objectives.
These objectives include: when services will start and end; who will provide the services; the criteria used for evaluating progress; and a statement of each student's current areas of competency.
At each school, an Admission, Review and Dismissal (ARD) committee, which includes teachers, counselors, administrators and other professionals, is expected to function on behalf of the student.
Federal guidelines require parents to participate in the ARD and IEP processes.
At every stage of the ARD process for a given student in special education, state and federal guidelines must be followed.
If disagreements or objections related to evaluation, placement or service delivery arise, students and their families have the right to due process.
School districts do not have the burden of demonstrating that their special education services are the best possible, but the education provided must meet each student's individual needs as prescribed in the IEP.
FINDING
Santa Gertrudis identified and served 30 Special Education students during the 1999-2000 school year, 15 at the high school and 15 at the elementary/middle school.
The district is served by a diagnostician, who coordinates the program and assists in administering testing for the Pre-Assessment ARD, and two special education teachers, one of which is also a Speech Language Pathologist.
Additionally the district contracts service personnel to provide vision services, orientation and mobility, occupational therapy and physical therapy.
The majority of special education students are in regular classes, while three are taught in a resource room due to special needs.
In November 1999, the district began receiving additional funds through the School Health and Related Services (SHARS) program.
SHARS reimburses districts for services provided to Medicaid-eligible students with disabilities.
For example, if a student's Individual Education Plan (IEP) mandates occupational, physical or speech therapy, and that student is Medicaid-eligible, the district can receive Medicaid reimbursement for providing these services.
From November 1999 to May 2000, the district received about $4,500 dollars in additional funds.
COMMENDATION
Santa Gertrudis ISD's Special Education program aggressively seeks financial resources for serving special education students.
Gifted and Talented
In 1995, state law required the State Board Of Education (SBOE) to develop and periodically update a state plan of the education of gifted and talented students.
The plan was to measure the performance of districts in providing services to students identified as gifted and talented.
The SBOE plan, adopted in 1996, provides direction on how to refine existing services and how to create additional curricular options for gifted students.
Section 29.122 of the Texas Education Code states that school districts "shall adopt a process for identifying and serving gifted and talented students in the district and shall establish a program for those students in each grade level."
Exhibit 2-20 compares SGISD's Gifted and Talented enrollment, teachers and budgeted expenditures for 1998-99 to its peers.
