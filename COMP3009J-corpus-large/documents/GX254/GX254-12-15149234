Re:
Centennial Clean Water Fund/Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund/Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Fund FY 2001 Funding Cycle Draft Offer and Applicant List
To Interested Persons: I am pleased to provide you with the enclosed state fiscal year 2001 (FY 2001) Draft Offer and Applicant List.
This list covers the Centennial Clean Water Fund (Centennial), the Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund (SRF), and the Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Fund (Section 319) programs.
The SRF Draft Intended Use Plan (IUP), which is available separately, also includes the projects for which SRF funding is proposed.
The projects proposed for funding reflect the highest priority water quality projects for the state of Washington.
Local governments, Native American tribes, and not-for-profit groups submitted 221 requests for funding consideration during the FY 2001 application cycle.
These proposed projects reflect approximately $268 million of funding need.
Based on an evaluation of these applications and directives from the Washington State Legislature, Ecology proposes to fund 73 activity and facility projects totaling approximately $89 million.
Proposed projects address wastewater treatment plant upgrades and collection system improvements, on-site septic system repair and replacement, water reclamation and reuse, watershed planning and implementation, riparian improvements, salmon habitat improvements, agricultural best management practices, stormwater management planning and implementation, public information/education, wellhead protection, and water quality monitoring.
Ecology continued to pilot a revised evaluation process during the FY 2001 funding cycle.
This process was developed the previous year with the assistance of an external advisory committee comprised of representatives from many client and stakeholder groups which are, or have been, grant and loan recipients.
Some additional "fine tuning" was made to the specific criteria and the local prioritization process employed for FY 2001.
Ecology, and other state agency staff, evaluated the proposals, assigned points, and used the points to develop a statewide priority list in ranked order.
Ecology also undertook a major marketing effort to ensure that all the SRF loan 2001, would be used for high priority projects statewide.
As an integral part of advertised lower interest rates for the period.
The result was phenomenal Â­ the more than eight times as much money as that requested during the previous, FY monies, available in FY our marketing effort we loan requests totaled 2000 funding cycle.
In
order to formally offer these lower rates, the program made minor changes to the rule governing the SRF (Chapter 173-98 WAC).
These changes created a simplified schedule for determining each year's interest rates and also allow the agency the flexibility to further lower those rates when analysis shows that lowering the rates will not adversely affect the health of the SRF loan portfolio.
This year, an independent analysis showed that the fund was very robust and could remain so with much lower interest rates for FY 2001.
This was the justification for the low rates advertised in January, which will help us obligate all the available funds for FY 2001.
Moreover, the lower rates will have a positive impact on the water quality of the state and the fiscal health of small towns struggling to fund projects.
Here are the interest rates for FY 2001: Repayment Period Up to five years: More than 5, but no more than 20 years: Interest Rate 0.5 percent 1.5 percent overview of Ecology staff remaining List will be
Ecology is holding two public meetings (see enclosed Public Notice) to present an these three funding programs and the process used to select projects for funding.
will discuss the preparation of the Draft List.
Information will be provided on the process and schedule to be followed before the FY 2001 Draft Offer and Applicant finalized.
We welcome public comments on the FY 2001 Draft Offer and Applicant List or the FY 2001 SRF Draft IUP at these meetings.
Alternatively, written comments will be accepted until August 2, 2000.
Please mail written comments to: Kim McKee Department of Ecology Water Quality Program PO Box 47600 Olympia, WA 98504-7600 If you have questions about the Centennial program, please contact Kim McKee at (360) 407-6566.
Questions about the SRF program can be directed to Brian Howard at (360) 407-6510 and questions for Section 319 can be directed to Dan Filip at (360) 407-6509.

Megan White, P.E., Manager Water Quality Program MW:smr Enclosure
Public Meeting Notice Proposed Funding for Water Quality Projects The Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) invites you discuss the preparation of the Draft Offer and Applicant List for the Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund, and the 319 Nonpoint Source Fund.
Ecology welcomes your comments on to attend a public meeting to Centennial Clean Water Fund, federal Clean Water Act Section the draft list.
Ecology proposes to fund 73 activity and facility projects during the state fiscal year 2001 (FY 2001) funding cycle.
Ecology proposes to fund approximately $24.9 million from the Centennial Clean Water Fund, $61.8 million from the Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund, and $2.2 million from the Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Fund.
This year Ecology is allocating more funding than ever before, $99 million in grants and loans.
This is largely due to the availability of SRF federal capitalization funds.
Ecology's water quality financial and technical assistance is essential to local governments, Native American tribes, and others.
The proposed projects will help prevent water pollution and protect water quality for swimming, boating, fish habitat, and other important uses.
A 1986 state statute created the Water Quality Account, which is financed primarily through taxes on tobacco products.
Ecology administers the Centennial Clean Water Fund, which is part of the Water Quality Account.
The agency offers Centennial grants and loans to local governments, Native American tribes, and other public entities for water pollution control projects.
Ecology also administers the Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund.
This program uses federal funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and provides low-interest loans to local governments, Native American tribes, and other public entities.
The loans are primarily for upgrading or expanding water pollution control facilities such as public sewage and stormwater plants, and for activities to address estuary management and nonpoint source water quality problems.
In addition, Ecology administers the federal Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Fund.
This fund provides grants to local governments, Native American tribes, state agencies, and nonprofit organizations to address nonpoint source pollution and to improve and protect water quality.
Nonpoint source pollution includes many diffuse sources of pollution including runoff from urban development, agricultural and timber practices, failing septic systems, pet waste, and gardening activities.
Ecology is an equal opportunity agency.

SUMMARY OF PROJECTS _______________________ FY 2001
Fiscal Year 2001 Centennial Clean Water Fund, Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund, Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Fund: Project Summaries Application number: applicant name: proposed project name: Description (from application) FP01001: Pomeroy City of: Wastewater Facilities Improvements: The project consists of high priority collection system improvements, upgrade and improving existing treatment facilities including construction of new aeration treatment components to provide efficient BOD, TSS, and ammonia removal.
New treatment facility will include a new influent lift station, mechanical screen, selector tanks, aeration basins, secondary clarifiers, and ultraviolet light disinfection equipment.
FP01002: San Juan County Health and Community Services : San Juan On-Site Failure Repair: This project will continue to provide revolving loan funds to property owners in San Juan County for the repair of failing on-site septic systems.
Eligible recipients will be identified through marketing and through education of on-site septic system contractors (designers, installers, pumpers, O
FP01003: Almira Town of: Almira Monitor Well FY2001: This will be a water quality monitoring project consisting of the construction of up to four monitoring wells, as specified in Chapter 173-160 WAC.
If the wells indicate the presence of ground water, a monitoring/testing program will be initiated for a period of eight calendar quarters (two years) and samples will be tested by a certified laboratory for six NPDES permit parameters and seven permit metal parameters.
Test results will be evaluated for the presence or absence of ground water contamination.
FP01004: Kent City of: Kent Wellhead Protection Program: Ground water modeling will improve the knowledge of the hydro-geologic framework of the regional aquifer.
The current calculated fixed radius method is insufficient for wellhead protection.
Completion of the project will provide management strategies to assist staff and elected officials in making wise policy decisions, protecting potable water supplies and aquatic habitat.
FP01005: Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe: Shoalwater/Tokeland Aquifer Study: This project will describe the source area and age of ground water under the Shoalwater Bay Reservation and Tokeland Peninsula using carbon-14 and tritium analysis, which will determine if the ground water is modern (post 1953) or pre-modern.
Premodern ground water has low susceptibility to contamination from human activities on the land surface.
FP01006: Dayton City of: Dayton Sewer Bond Defeasance: The City has issued several million dollars in revenue bonds to help pay for a sewer plant rehabilitation at about five percent average interest.
A low interest loan would allow us to defeasance these bonds and consequently charge a much lower utility rate to a low income community.
FP01007: Adams Conservation District: Agriculture Non-Point Source Pollution Prevention: This nonpoint source pollution reduction project is designed to reduce sediment and associated pollutant loadings to impaired water bodies contributed from Adams County through implementing a variety of BMPs including innovative erosion control practices.
This project will monitor effects of BMP implementation.
FP01008: Garfield Town of: Rural Development Loan Transfer to SRF Loan: The Wastewater Facilities Improvement project is now complete and consisted of converting the existing trickling filter process to an activated bio-filter process.
The town of Garfield is requesting to refinance their Wastewater Facilities Improvement project from a Rural Development 4.5 percent loan to an Ecology 1.5 percent, 20-year loan.
FP01009: Uniontown Town of: Wastewater Facilities Plan Amendment: The date of the town of Uniontown's Wastewater Facilities Plan, is June, 1977.
This 1977 Plan is out of date.
The Town needs to complete an amendment to the 1977 plan in order to define their needs, options for improvements, and set goals for future planning.
FP01010: Adams Conservation District: Cow Creek BMP Implementation Project: The goal of the project is to reduce nonpoint source pollution.
The objective is to implement BMPs to reduce nonpoint source pollution contributions from agricultural activities.
Efforts include: Install offsite water supply for winter feeding operation; Implement riparian enhancements; Establish gully erosion control; Implement critical seeding and erosion protection.

The latter effort has resulted in the identification of several nondairy livestock operations in WRIA 23 that are not in compliance with State and local water quality laws and are contributing pollutants into the Upper Chehalis River Basin.
This project seeks to fund technical assistance from an alliance made up of three Conservation Districts that cover WRIA 23 to be made available to nondairy landowners in WRIA 23.
The technical assistance will consist of the development and implementation of conservation plans designed to reduce or eliminate water pollution.
FP01203: Tumwater City of: Lower Deschutes Water Quality Project: This project will enhance Deschutes River water quality and salmon habitat by address high summer temperatures, turbidity, insufficient large woody debris (LWD) and impaired riparian functions.
Volunteers will revegetate 6.8 acres with 3400 native plants.
Bioengineering, including LWD, will reduce sediment and enhance habitat for Chinook, coho, steelhead, and cutthroat.
FP01204: Adopt-A-Stream Foundation: Fish Passage/Water Pollution Assessment: Stream surveys will be conducted in three urbanizing watersheds to locate water pollution sources, determine water types, and identify barriers to salmon migration.
The following will result: Water pollution corrective action recommendations provided to landowners, water type designations corrected for local governments, and fish migration barriers mapped.
FP01205: Lacey City of: 15th Avenue Stormwater Treatment Acquisition: The project involves the purchase of property along 15th Avenue NE, near Lacey, Washington for the purpose of developing a regional stormwater treatment facility.
The facility would lower pollutant loadings to Woodland Creek and Henderson Inlet by intercepting untreated stormwater currently discharging into Woodland Creek from Olympia, Lacey, and Thurston County.
FP01206: Lacey City of: Eagle Creek Sub-Basin Characterization: Eagle Creek is an ephemeral tributary to Woodland Creek, Lacey's main drainage basin.
Eagle Creek lies within Lacey's Urban Growth Area and is surrounded by undeveloped moderate and high density zoned land.
With the encroachment of future development, the city of Lacey and Thurston County would like to have a comprehensive study of the Eagle Creek Basin to include surface as well as shallow subsurface water flow.
