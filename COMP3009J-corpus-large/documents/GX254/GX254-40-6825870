I.
Funds Available for Projects
This Draft Intended Use Plan (IUP) describes how the state of Washington plans to use the moneys available to the Washington State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund (SRF) during state fiscal year 2001 (FY 2001).
Total funds available for this year's IUP will be $63,702,661.
This total is based on receiving the federal fiscal year (FFY) 1999 and 2000 Title VI capitalization grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the required 20 percent state match to the federal grants from Washington State's 1999 - 2001 biennial appropriations, and principal and interest repayments from previous funding cycle loan recipients.
Four percent of the federal Title VI capitalization grants are designated for the Department of Ecology's (Ecology) eligible administration costs.
The remaining $61,829,130 will be available as loans for water pollution control projects.
The following table illustrates SRF funds available for FY 2001.
Federal Fiscal Year 1999 Title VI Grant State Match (20%) to Federal Fiscal Year 1999 Federal Title VI Grant Federal Fiscal Year 2000 Title VI Grant State Match (20%) to Federal Fiscal Year 2000 Federal Title VI Grant Principal and Interest Repayments from Previous Funding Cycle Recipients Total SRF Funds Less (4%) of Federal Fiscal Year 1999 Title VI Grant for SRF Administration Less (4%) of Federal Fiscal Year 2000 Title VI Grant for SRF Administration Advertised SRF Funds Available for Projects $23,419,143 $4,683,829 $23,419,143 $4,683,829 $7,496,718 $63,702,662 ($936,766) ($936,766) $61,829,130
Total demand for SRF funds this funding cycle exceeds the amount available.
The SRF program received 94 funding requests for over $228 million.
The state of Washington is proposing to offer approximately $61.8 million in low-interest loans to 31 local governments for 36 highpriority water quality projects.
II.
Goals
Ecology has both long-and short-term goals that guide the administration of the SRF program.
These goals are: A. Short-Term Goals 1.
Work with Ecology's Water Quality Financial Advisory Council to revise and update the SRF rule (Chapter 173-98 WAC "Uses and Limitations of the Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund") that includes but is not limited to:

B. Long-Term Goals 1.
To integrate, to the greatest extent possible, the SRF with the Centennial Clean Water Fund (Centennial), and the federal Clean Water Act Section 319 Nonpoint Source Program (Section 319) to maximize limited state and federal grant and loan funds to improve and protect the water quality of the state of Washington.
To provide financial assistance to communities to achieve compliance with state and federal water pollution control requirements, implement nonpoint source pollution control programs, and develop and implement estuary conservation and management programs.

5.
To protect public health and water quality, and to achieve overall improvement and protection of the environment.
To encourage local governments to develop and implement projects which will prevent water quality degradation, including wetland protection projects.
To assist communities with financial difficulties in meeting required public health and water quality standards while maintaining the health and perpetuity of the SRF according to federal law and guidance.
To provide the type and amount of financial assistance most advantageous to communities, consistent with the long-term health of the fund.
To administer the SRF program to ensure that the financial integrity, viability, and revolving nature are maintained.
To integrate local watershed planning legislation passed during the 1998 legislature in evaluating and prioritizing water quality project proposals.
The local watershed planning approach to water quality management involves: Â· Phase 1 - the establishment of a watershed planning unit that includes representatives of state, county, and tribal governments located in one or more of the 62 water resource inventory areas of Washington State.
Phase 2 Â­ development of watershed assessments that address, where applicable, water quantity, instream flows, and habitat.
Phase 3 Â­ development of a watershed plan based on recommendations of watershed assessment and begin to implement water quality protection and prevention projects.
III.
Uses and Terms of Financial Assistance

Â· Â·
A. Uses Details of specific uses of SRF moneys are contained in the state regulation (Chapter 173-98 WAC "Uses and Limitations of the Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund"), program guidelines (revised December, 1999), and the Operating Agreement (dated September 11, 1989.)
In summary, SRF moneys can be used to support projects in three funding categories: water pollution control facilities category, nonpoint source pollution control category, and comprehensive estuary conservation and management category.
SRF moneys can be issued for the following purposes:
Page 3 of 9
1.
To make loans, at or below market interest rates, to applicants in order to finance the planning, design, implementation, development and construction of facilities and activities.
To buy or refinance the debt obligations, for construction of water pollution control facilities, incurred after March 7, 1985.
To guarantee or purchase insurance for local obligations to improve credit rating.
To provide security or a source of revenue for State SRF issued bonds.
To finance reasonable costs incurred by Ecology in administering the SRF program.

B. Terms
The terms of SRF financial assistance are established and included in Chapter 6 of the program guidelines.
However, after the guidelines were published Ecology evaluated the current SRF loan portfolio to determine if loan interest rates and terms could be reduced from the current level and still maintain the fund in perpetuity in accordance with federal law.
The analysis showed that the fund was very robust and could remain so with much lower rates for FY 2001.
In addition, the lower rates will have a positive impact on the water quality of the state, the fiscal health of small towns struggling to fund projects, and lower interest rates helped market the program.
For example, during the SRF FY 2000 funding cycle approximately $25 million was requested for projects by local governments and this funding cycle over $228 million was requested.
For FY 2001, the following terms are offered to applicants: Repayment Period Up to five years: 15-to 20-years: Interest Rate 0.5 percent 1.5 Percent
In order to formally offer these lower interest rates, Ecology made minor changes to the rule governing the SRF program (Chapter 173-98 WAC).
These changes created a simplified schedule for determining each year's interest rates and also allow the agency to further lower those rates when analysis shows that lowering the rates will not adversely affect the health of the SRF loan portfolio.
Applicants may be considered for financial hardship terms if their proposed projects would cause user charges to exceed 1.5 percent of the median household income.
If Ecology determines that financial hardship exists, it may structure SRF agreements with terms to help keep user charges below the financial hardship level, if possible.
Hardship terms may include lengthening the repayment period to a maximum of 20 years and/or adjusting the interest rate to as low as 0 percent.

Assurances and Certifications
The necessary assurances and certifications required by Title VI of the Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987, and the EPA have been included in the Operating Agreement between the state of Washington and EPA.
Section IV.C of the Operating Agreement states "The Department of Ecology shall transfer into the SRF a state match consisting of either cash or a letter of credit, which equals 20 percent of each federal grant payment, on or before the date when the state of Washington receives the federal grant payment."
To further clarify this, Washington State will provide EPA with a "Letter of Commitment" which shows that the required state match has been committed.
Washington's matching share will be deposited into the SRF account when an actual draw is made for the federal share of SRF moneys.

Criteria and Method for Distribution of Funds
The following approach was used to develop the proposed distribution of $61,829,130 to local governments from the SRF: A. Applications for Funding Information about the SRF program, workshops and the application period for SRF assistance were distributed to local governments and interested persons statewide.
During January 2000 four public workshops were held statewide in Tacoma, Everett, Spokane, and Yakima.
At the workshops, information on the SRF program and the application process was presented.
Two additional workshops were held during February 2000, in Spokane and Bellevue, to provide applicants technical assistance and to answer one-on-one, specific project and application questions.
Applications for funding were accepted during the application period, from January 3, 2000, through February 29, 2000 .
Based on information provided in the applications, projects were evaluated and prioritized.
A detailed description of the application and project evaluation process is found in Chapter 2 of the Water Quality Financial Assistance Programs Guidelines.
A summary of the process is described below.
B. Project Evaluation Ecology used a new evaluation process during the FY 2000 funding cycle.
This process was refined for the SRF FY 2001 funding cycle.
The process incorporates changes from previous
Page 7 of 9
finding cycles, suggested by Ecology's external group the Water Quality Financial Advisory Council (Council).
The Council comprised of representatives from many stakeholder groups which includes grant and loan recipients.
The Council reviewed the previous evaluation and ranking process and identified areas where changes were needed.
Ecology used these recommendations to develop the evaluation system used for the FY 2001 funding cycle.
In their most important guidance, the Council recommended to continue using evaluation criteria with assigned point values.
Ecology had used points in the past but had not used them for several funding cycles.
In the revised system, evaluators assigned points for answers provided by applicants to questions in five categories.
An additional category at the beginning of the questionnaire requests the applicant discuss the overall water quality problem and how the problem will be solved or addressed by the project.
No points are assigned, but the answer serves as frame of reference for applicants and evaluators.
The categories are: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Overall water quality problem and how the problem will be solved or addressed by the project.
Specific public health and water quality impairments caused by the problem and pollution prevention aspects.
(Category total: 340 points) How the project addresses the water quality problem/ measures of success.
(Category total: 340 points) Local initiatives taken to make the proposed project a success.
(Category total: 120 points) State of Washington or Federal mandates that this proposed project addresses.
(Category total: 100 points) Local Priority-Setting Process.
(Category total: 100 points)
Ecology evaluated the proposals, assigned points, and used the points to develop a statewide priority list in numerical order.
At their discretion, other state agency staff involved in water pollution control and public health provided funding recommendations to Ecology evaluators.
VII.
Distribution of Funds
Chapter 173-98 WAC, Uses and Limitations of the Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund, updated in 1999, requires Ecology to distribute money according to the following category allocations: Eighty percent of the fund is to be used for water pollution control facilities, 10 percent of the fund is reserved for nonpoint source pollution control, and 10 percent is allocated for comprehensive estuary conservation and management.
Unless the demand for funds is limited, not more than 50 percent of each funding category allocation can be awarded to any one applicant.
In addition, if requests for SRF assistance in one category do not result in the offer of
Page 8 of 9
all available funds, any remaining funds are transferred to other categories.
Loans may be provided for up to 100 percent of the total eligible project cost.
Loan offers that will be identified on the Final IUP will be effective for up to one year from the date of the offer or until the issuance of the next year's Final IUP.
All SRF loan offers that do not result in a signed SRF loan agreement within the effective offer period are automatically terminated.
Funds reserved for SRF loan agreements that are not signed within the effective period maybe carried over and made available for the next year's funding cycle or offered to applicants who did not receive all funds requested or to other applicant on the Final IUP who did not receive funding offers.
VIII.
