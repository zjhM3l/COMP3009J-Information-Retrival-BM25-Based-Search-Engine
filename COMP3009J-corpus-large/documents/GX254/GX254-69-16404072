B. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) is ideally suited to offer unique opportunities to the K-12 and professional teacher development (PTD) market.
Educational programming linked to research and stewardship was incorporated at the Reserves from NERRS' inception in 1972.
Currently twenty-four Reserves are offering K-12 and PTD to a wide range of audiences.
In 2002-2003 NERRS Educators identified that a K-12 and PTD inventory and assessment project was a high priority action item.
It would provide baseline data, synthesis, and recommendations for program improvements in support of the NERRS Strategic Plan.
In September of 2002, Pandion Systems was contracted to complete the project with the following study objectives: o An inventory and assessment, both quantitative and qualitative, of current programming for K-12 and professional teacher development (PTD) across the 25 Reserves and how these programs integrate state and national standards.
o Recommendations for improved program evaluation and performance measurement.
o Recommendations for improving program design and implementation, as well as needs for national-level support and capacity building activity.
o Recommendations and associated implications for a national "niche" or systemwide program or activity in the areas of K-12 education and professional teacher development.
In order to meet the project objectives, various data collection methods were used.
Initially, three on-line surveys were administered to various staff members.
The Education Coordinators (ECs) answered two online surveys: a general survey that collected data on their entire K-12 and PTD program and an individual program survey that collected specific data on each current K-12 and PTD program.
The Reserve Managers (RMs), Research Coordinators (RCs), and Stewardship Coordinators (SCs) answered a survey that collected data about communication at each Reserve and about support for K-12 and PTD education programs.
After the data was collected from the online surveys, a follow-up survey for the ECs was designed and implemented through in-depth telephone interviews and four site visits.
The open-ended questions were designed to clarify answers given in online surveys and to seek in-depth information for specific project objectives.
The inventory data from the online individual survey was compiled into an accessible database format for future use by the Reserves and the NERRS national office.
In addition, the data was compiled and analyzed.
2
The Survey revealed some very interesting results.
Some of the more fascinating and important results are outlined below.
General Information o 84% of the Reserves have an educational facility.
o 92% of the Reserves have one or more full-time education employees.
o 46% of the Reserves spend a large amount of time running K-12 programs.
o 83% of the Reserves spend a small amount of time running PTD programs.
o ECs spend 54% of their time on other responsibilities versus K-12 and PTD responsibilities.
K-12 Programs o Approximately 66,000 to 67,000 students participated in K-12 programs in 2002.
o The most common K-12 program topics are estuary biology and ecology, human impacts on estuaries (including land use), and citizen stewardship.
o Sixth through eighth grades are the most common target audience for K-12 programs, followed by fourth and fifth grade.
o 51% of Reserves partnered with other organizations to deliver K-12 programs.
o 91% of K-12 programs use internal budget money to fund K-12 programs.
o The most common methods of program evaluation are staff observation and tracking participant attendance figures.
PTD Programs o Approximately 1,800 to 2,000 teachers participated in PTD programs in 2002.
o The most common PTD program topics are estuary biology and ecology, human impacts on estuaries (including land use), and chemical/physical/geological sciences.
o Sixth through eighth grade teachers are the most common target audience for PTD programs, followed by high school teachers, and fourth and fifth grade teachers.
o 84% of Reserves use part of their internal budget and 53% use partners to help fund PTD programs.
o The most common methods of PTD program evaluation are staff observation, tracking participant attendance figures, and feedback cards.
After synthesizing and analyzing the data, the results were categorized into areas based on the study objectives: Program Design and Implementation; National and State Educational Standards; Program Evaluation and Performance Measurement; National or System-Wide Program or Activity; and Capacity Building.
Program Design and Implementation Several study questions identify target audience selection and internal and external influences that shape K-12 and PTD.
Target audience selection differs for K-12 and PTD programs.
For K-12 programs, target audience selection is determined by the group's flexibility to attend a program.
PTD target audience selection is determined in two ways: 1) providing half-day or full-day trainings for teachers who bring their students to the Reserve, and 2) targeting specific grade levels for longer workshops that give teachers
3
specific estuarine science and conservation knowledge.
For both K-12 and PTD the most common external influences are frequency of requests and inclusion in a Reserve initiative.
ECs say that the internal influences that shape program design and implementation are physical facilities, time of year a Reserve can offer a program, and the remoteness of the Reserve location.
National and State Educational Standards Throughout the country, Reserves report that it is increasingly difficult to have students and teachers visit the Reserve if they do not correlate programs to state standards.
Currently, 57% of K-12 programs are correlated to state standards and 67% of PTD programs are correlated to state standards.
When correlating programs to state standards, the preferred method is to develop the program first and then match it to corresponding standards.
Most programs are not correlated to national standards, which is not surprising because school systems are ultimately held accountable to state standards.
Program Evaluation and Performance Measurement Little formal evaluation occurs for K-12 and PTD programs.
The most common form of evaluation is staff observation and tracking participant attendance figures.
Thirty-one percent of the K-12 programs reports having no formal evaluation and only a quarter of the programs have any type of follow-up surveys, pre- and post-program surveys, or feedback cards.
For PTD programs, 22% of the programs have no formal evaluation and less than half have follow-up surveys, pre and post surveys, or feedback cards.
National or System-Wide Program or Activity In general, there is support for some form of a system-wide program or activity.
Around 60% of ECs agree that system-wide NERRS education objectives, educational program(s), and curriculum would help them improve educational programs at their Reserve.
However, the support is mixed because there are contrasting opinions.
ECs do agree that if any national program is implemented, it should be flexible and well supported with a long term commitment, adequate funding, and central coordination.
ECs indicated that a national-level NERRS curriculum or program might include: o Introductory materials that each Reserve could use as springboard for site-specific programs o Creative national marketing strategies that highlight commonalities in programs and focus among Reserves o National PTD certification program o National goals and objectives o Comprehensive and Integrated o Website o Evaluation tools and methods
4
Capacity Building Capacity building is defined as any activity or resource that might assist the K-12 and PTD programs.
This includes strengthening partnerships, program support, communication, funding, and training.
Partnerships are used by Reserves in several major ways: to gain or share resources, to build programs, and to build relationships.
Fifty-six percent of ECs use partnerships to gain or share resources for funding (for program salaries), people (staff, volunteers), facilities, (classrooms, dorms), equipment (canoes, boats, lab materials), education or training materials, time, audience mailing lists, and transportation services.
Reserve Managers are generally supportive of ECs, and allow the autonomy of ECs to manage their own areas of responsibility.
ECs feel that increased communication with RCs would improve education programs.
It was found that the Reserve staff at each site is small and the workload is great, so it is often easy for staff to become narrowly focused on their area.
Communication between staff occurs at all of the sites, but in many cases only when a specific need arises.
Several questions probed ECs greatest needs for funding and training.
Funding is needed for more paid education staff to assist with programs, teacher stipends, and transportation.
The greatest training needs for EC professional development include training for program evaluation, education standards correlations, curriculum design, and to increase ecological knowledge and skills.
A key outcome of the project was to provide recommendations to improve NERRS K-12 and PTD programs.
NERRS is a unique organization with many strengths.
NERRS' mission, structure, and diversity give it the potential to be a leader in estuarine education on a national level.
With this in mind, the following recommendations were developed.
Reserve Level Recommendations Recommendation 1: Develop an EC position description The EC position description should include some broad qualifications and duties that can be integrated with Reserve-specific qualifications and responsibilities.
This could be used as a guide to create consistency across the network.
Recommendation 2: Provide training for ECs The creation of an annual development plan for each EC that builds on their key strengths and identifies areas for further development would help each EC to increase their expertise in both estuarine science and education.
ECs should be proactive to determine specific professional development opportunities for themselves and present a proposal to their RM so that they can expand their professional capabilities.
5
Recommendation 3: Increase paid education staff The education staff has many program responsibilities including CTP, Coastal Decision Makers Workshops, school programs, and public programs.
In addition, ECs have administrative and overall operations responsibilities that take over half of their time.
ECs need more staff to run safer programs and to increase program attendance.
It is important to identify the Reserves that need more staff and determine if it can be pursued on a federal or state level.
Recommendation 4: Secure outside funding for K-12 and PTD programs Over 84% of all K-12 and PTD programs are funded by internal budgets.
ECs indicate they need assistance in finding outside funding to increase or improve current Reserve programs.
National Level Recommendations Recommendation 5: Hire a national K-12 and PTD education coordinator; secure direct and consistent funding for any new system-wide K-12 and PTD programming If there is a commitment to K-12 and PTD programs from a system-wide standpoint, a central coordinator position needs to be established.
The coordinator would take the leadership role on any national or system-wide program(s), including an evaluation and performance measurement framework.
Recommendation 6: Provide assistance to Reserves to secure outside funding The national office or national education coordinator could serve as a repository for a catalog of funding opportunities.
The national Education Coordinator could serve as the lead in writing proposals for grants to other federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Science Foundation, as well as to private funding sources.
Recommendation 7: Maintain a database of examples of NERRS K-12 and PTD programs Maintaining a database of examples of successful NERRS K-12 and PTD programs and "lessons learned" is more manageable and sustainable with today's technology.
The database could be stored on a NERRS K-12 and PTD website for ECs.
A separate website for the public could help market the programs.
Recommendation 8: Provide assistance to correlate all NERRS programs to state educational standards Although ECs can be trained to correlate programs to state standards themselves, their workload prevents this from being a high priority.
Correlating programs and curricula to
6
state standards will increase the likelihood that educators will use the materials, come to PTD trainings, and bring their students to Reserve K-12 programs.
Assistance might include training and/or assistance performing correlations.
Recommendation 9: Establish national performance measures and Reserve-level goals and objectives The national office, with EC input, should develop key national goals that are important and applicable throughout NERRS, and then tie them to measurable objectives.
At the Reserve level, the national office should assist with the development of goals and objectives that would relate to each particular Reserve's target audiences.
The objectives could be knowledge, attitude, or action based.
The Reserves could mirror state benchmarks or standards for their objectives.
Recommendation 10: Develop and implement an evaluation framework that would measure factors at a national level and Reserve level There is no established evaluation framework at the national level and only a few Reserves consistently evaluate their programs.
It is important that Reserves define the level and types of formal evaluation that would be most useful and that ECs create an efficient and consistent plan to evaluate their programs.
Recommendation 11: Provide assistance for a K-12 and PTD market analysis and needs assessment for newer Reserves or Reserves interested in re-assessing their programs A market analysis and needs assessment would assist Reserves in the development of effective programs, the development of an evaluation and performance measurement framework, and participation in a system-wide program.
Recommendation 12: Provide assistance for a PTD market analysis and needs assessment for Reserves that offer or want to offer PTD programs A market analysis and needs assessment would assist Reserves that offer PTD programs in the development of effective programs, the development of an evaluation and performance measurement framework, and teacher recruitment.
Recommendation 13: Continue national marketing to support local K-12 and PTD initiatives ECs want more marketing materials to supplement their programs or market any systemwide program.
There is also a desire for a central NERRS K-12 and PTD website that could be a link among Reserve programs and any national program.
7
Recommendation 14: Develop and offer a system-wide NERRS K-12 and PTD program focused on field-based estuarine research Many Reserve educational initiatives already integrate Reserve research and a majority of ECs (96%) indicate that research is a differentiating factor for their K-12 and PTD programs.
There are many organizations doing coastal and marine K-12 and PTD education, but few of them are filling an estuarine education niche with a research focus.
It makes sense that field-based estuarine research be the focus for a system-wide K-12 and PTD program.

C. INTRODUCTION National Estuarine Research Reserve System K-12 and PTD Background The National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS), formed in 1972, incorporated an education program linked to research and stewardship at its inception.
Twenty-four Reserves are currently offering K-12 and PTD programs for a wide range of audiences.
Many have been conducting these programs for a number of years, others are re-evaluating current programs, and a third group of newer Reserves are developing programs.
NERRS education staff have diverse talents and each Reserve has it's own set of unique characteristics, challenges, and opportunities.
Some of the differences and challenges stem from the diverse group of state partners, and the status of the school system and political climate in each state.
With tightening school budgets and increasing pressure to meet standardized testing goals, teachers have had difficulty securing funding and time for workshops, programs, and fieldtrips.
NERRS is ideally suited to offer many opportunities to the K-12 and PTD market.
Reserves have well defined goals and objectives and have the flexibility to create innovative programming that fits the needs of their local and regional communities.
In addition to their "local flexibility," NERRS also has many common themes that can be explored to create a system-wide program or activity that will have a meaningful national impact on youth and teachers Study Objectives NERRS Educators initiated the K-12 and PTD inventory and assessment project as a high priority action item in 2002-2003.
It was to provide baseline data, synthesis and recommendations for program improvements in support of the NERRS Strategic Plan.
Specific study objectives include: o Inventory and assessment, both quantitative and qualitative, of current programming for K-12 and professional teacher development across the 25 Reserves and how these programs integrate state and national standards.
o Recommendations for improved program evaluation and performance measurement.
o Recommendations for improving program design and implementation, as well as needs for national-level support and capacity building activity.
o Recommendations and associated implications for a national "niche" or systemwide program or activity in the areas of K-12 education and professional teacher development.

Methodology In October 2002, the Formal Education Workgroup and members of Pandion Systems' team had an initial telephone meeting to begin development of the project.
Following the meeting, Pandion Staff met with Education Coordinators (ECs) at their annual meeting in Cape Cod at the Waquoit Bay Reserve.
At this meeting the formal objectives and data collection topics were discussed so that the Pandion team could confirm the objectives, refine a work plan, and establish deliverables for the project.
The data collection methods agreed upon by the group were online surveys, in-depth telephone interviews, and limited site visits.
Data Collection Pandion administered three on-line surveys to various NERRS staff members.
The ECs answered two online surveys: a general survey that collected data on their entire K-12 and PTD program and an individual program survey that collected specific data on each current K-12 and PTD program.
The Reserve Managers (RMs), Research Coordinators (RCs), and Stewardship Coordinators (SCs) answered a survey that collected data about communication at each Reserve and about support for K-12 and PTD education programs.
The first online survey was a general survey that targeted the ECs.
It was designed to provide initial data to address the four project objectives.
At the end of the general survey each EC was asked to list each current K-12 program and current PTD program (taught within the last year).
The second online survey was designed to capture information about each individual K12 and PTD program that was listed in the general survey.
ECs submitted a separate survey for each program.
These questions were used to satisfy the first objective of the project: to provide a system-wide inventory of the NERRS K-12 and PTD education programs.
Following the two initial online surveys, each EC was interviewed in an in-depth telephone survey that included several follow up questions.
The open-ended questions were designed to clarify answers given in online surveys and to seek in-depth information for specific project objectives.
The third online survey was sent to Reserve Managers (RMs), Research Coordinators (RCs), and Stewardship Coordinators (SCs).
These questions were designed to capture data to determine how research and stewardship aspects of the Reserves contribute to K12 and PTD programs.
Finally, site visits were conducted, spending one day each at four Reserves, asking the same questions from the in-depth telephone interview.
Site visits allowed us to spend more time discussing some of these questions.
In addition, we conducted brief face-to-
10
face interviews with other staff members including RMs, RCs, and SCs.
We also viewed and gathered some samples of K-12 and PTD materials.
Of the 25 existing Reserves, 24 responded to the online surveys (the 25th Reserve does not have an EC), and 24 also responded to both the individual program online surveys, and the telephone interview (N=20) or site visit interview (N=4).
We also collected online surveys from 19 RMs, 17 RCs, and 9 SCs.
To protect respondent confidentiality each survey was coded and access was restricted to the study team.
Data Interpretation Constraints A multiple-choice survey with Likert scale questions was used to determine responses for many categories.
When this type of data is gathered there are constraints based on the choices available for respondents to answer.
During the follow-up interviews, ECs were more flexible when they could explain their answers.
An example occurred in the followup interview when each EC was asked about their feelings for developing a national program.
Some ECs that indicated in the online survey that they did not want a national program were able to explain why and add clarifiers that identified the type of national program or activity that would work for them.
There are two other cases where there was confusion about a question and the study team found that there were multiple interpretations of the question.
The first case involves confusion about the definition of formal evaluation.
The online individual survey posed the question "What type of formal evaluation has been done for this program?" with a list of corresponding answers to choose from.
Another question in the follow-up telephone interview asked "For programs that have been formally evaluated, what were the results?" In both questions, ECs could have interpreted the definition of formal evaluation as a program that has had specific data collected and analyzed quantitatively; or as a program that has feedback collected and has been reviewed on a case by case basis, but has not had any formal quantitative results tabulated.
In some cases ECs also interpreted the definition of formal evaluation as an evaluation conducted by an outside party.
The second case involves a question from the online general EC survey, "Rate the degree to which your Reserve educational programs (K-12 and PTD) are different from other coastal related programs."
There were 10 parts where ECs were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 (where 1 equals not at all different and 10 equals very different).
When analyzing the results there was a double meaning that made the results unclear.
The question was interpreted differently by ECs.
For example, one part asked to rate on a 110 scale (where 1 equaled not at all different and 10 equaled very different) "We integrate research from the Reserve into programs."
If a 5 rating was given it was unclear if they did not integrate research into their programs thus there is no differentiating factor or if they did integrate research and the other providers also did too.
In retrospect this question should have been separated into two parts.

D. INVENTORY SUMMARY General Information As the main objective for the project, it was important to gather specific information about each NERRS program.
Several questions were asked on the general EC survey to get a clear picture of the current state of each Reserve's education facilities, staff size, and staff time spent on conducting K-12 and PTD programs.
During the follow-up telephone interviews, questions were asked to elicit information about EC educational background and previous work experience, and the time each EC spent on K-12 or PTD programs versus their other responsibilities.
Facilities In the general survey each EC was asked whether they have an educational facility (e.g. training facility, classroom, or environmental education center). o 84% of the Reserves have an educational facility.
o 16% of the Reserves do not have an educational facility Education and Volunteer Staff ECs were asked to specify what types and how many staff members they have (Table 1). o Twelve of the Reserves (50%) have one full-time staff member that works on K12 and PTD programs.
o 21% of Reserves have two full-time education staff members.

The specific amounts of Â¼, Â½, and Â¾ part-time employees were not significant enough to report individually, so these were summarized as simple binary responses (yes or no).
The highest number of part-time staff in any category at one Reserve was four.
The highest number of volunteers at one Reserve was seven (Table 2).

Time Education Staff Spends Running K-12 and PTD Programs The amount of time that the education staff at each Reserve spends on running K-12 and PTD programs are reported on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 equals none and 10 equals all.
In the case of K-12 programs, the mean of 5.17 is misleading because the distribution of responses is grouped in large clusters on either end of the continuum.
Fifty-four percent of the responses rate the time they spend running K-12 programs as a 5 or less versus 46% that rate the time they spend running K-12 programs as a 6 or higher.
Time staff spends running PTD programs has a mean of 2.92 and 83% of the respondents rate this as a 3 or less.

K-12 and PTD Duties Versus Other EC Responsibilities During the in-depth telephone interviews, a follow-up question was used to find out what activities and responsibilities the ECs focus on.
Each EC divides their time between the following topics: K-12 program development and coordination, actual teaching/training time of K-12 programs, PTD program development and coordination, actual teaching/training of PTD programs, and other responsibilities.
Each EC assigns a percent value so that all five areas total to equal 100%.
Each EC also lists their other responsibilities.
Figure 2 represents the average time ECs spend working on each activity.

K-12 Program Inventory A total of 86 K-12 programs were reported from 23 Reserves.
What follows is a descriptive breakdown of the programs by topic, target audience, and format.
Other questions relate to logistics, implementation, marketing, funding, and evaluation methods, which are also summarized in this section.
Note that some programs list more than one choice for each area.
K-12 Program Breakdown by Topic Three program topics are the most common among Reserves.
Seventy-nine programs cover the topic estuary biology and ecology, 71 programs cover the topic human impacts on estuaries (including land use), and 57 programs cover citizen stewardship as a topic (Fig. 3).
These represent common topics that may be used as themes for a national niche.

K-12 Program Breakdown by Target Audience The highest number of programs targets grades six through eight (64) and then grades four and five (59) (Fig. 4).
In the follow-up telephone interviews and site visits, it was found that grades six through eight are a common target because these students have the ability to comprehend the subject matter, they are physically capable of performing program activities, and have the flexibility to participate in field trips.

K-12 Program Number of Annual Participants In 2002, approximately 66,000 to 67,000 students participated in Reserve K-12 programs.
These numbers are based on the individual surveys submitted by each Reserve.
In many cases summer camp programs were not included as a K-12 program, although some Reserves did submit these summer attendance numbers and they are included in the total numbers above.
K-12 Program Locations K-12 programs are presented at certain physical locations and environmental settings.
Forty-two programs occurred at a Reserve.
It is interesting to note that nine programs occurred out in the field but at field sites other than the Reserve (Fig. 6).

K-12 Program Partnerships and Funding Fifty-one percent of Reserves partner with others to deliver K-12 programs.
Even though approximately half of the programs involve partnerships, it is clear that most of the programs are funded through their internal budgets.
The second leading source of funds is grant proposals, and the third leading source of funds is from partners (Fig. 10).
Some Reserves list multiple funding sources.

PTD Inventory A total of 45 PTD programs were reported from 19 Reserves.
What follows is a descriptive breakdown of the programs by topic, target audience, and format.
Other questions relate to logistics, implementation, marketing, funding, and evaluation methods, and they are also summarized in this section.
Note that some programs list more than one choice for each of these areas.
PTD Program Breakdown by Topic Three PTD program topics are the most common among Reserves.
Thirty-eight programs cover the topic estuary biology and ecology, 36 programs cover human impacts on estuaries (including land use), and 35 programs cover chemical/physical/geological sciences (Fig. 12).
These represent common topics that may be used as themes for a national niche.
The two most common PTD program topics, estuary biology and ecology and human impacts on estuaries (including land use), are the same as the most common K-12 program topics.

PTD Program Breakdown by Target Audience The highest number of PTD programs target teachers of grades six through eight (44 programs).
High school teachers are the second largest target group (35 programs).
The third largest target group is teachers of grades four and five (31 programs) (Fig. 13).
Many PTD programs cover a range of grade levels and list more than one target audience.
Similar to the K-12 program target audience group, teachers of grades six through eight are a common target audience because these students have the ability to comprehend the subject matter, they are physically capable of performing program activities, and have the flexibility to participate in field trips.

Number of Programs
PTD Program Number of Annual Participants In 2002, approximately 1,800 to 2,000 teachers participated in Reserve PTD programs.
These numbers are based on the individual surveys submitted by each Reserve and include workshops offered during the summer.
PTD Program Locations PTD programs are presented at certain physical locations and environmental settings.
Twenty-six programs occur at a Reserve and eight programs occur at partner sites (Fig. 15).

In many cases, a PTD program has more than one activity and therefore occurs in more than one setting.
All 45 programs inventoried have a portion of the program that is conducted indoors.
The results indicate that 35 programs have activities that occur outside on land, 22 programs have outdoor activities that occur outside in a water area (but not on a boat), and 24 programs use a boat for a PTD activity (Fig. 16).

PTD Programs Marketing Reserves use a variety of methods to attract teacher participation.
Many Reserves employ more than one method.
The most common methods among the Reserves are word of mouth (34 programs), passing information on to various school officials including teachers, district coordinators, and administrators (30 programs each), and 24 programs are marketed through Reserve newsletters (Fig. 18).

PTD Program Partnerships and Funding Seventy-three percent of PTD programs use partnerships in some form to deliver their programs.
Partners are used for program instruction, for facilities, added funding/sponsorship, and to increase visibility of the program.
Funds come from multiple sources.
Thirty-eight programs use some funds from their internal budget and 24 programs receive funding from their partners.
Thirteen programs gain funding from grant proposals (Fig. 19).

PTD Program Pricing PTD program pricing varies (Table 9 and 10).
Many programs are a half-day or full-day workshop and some programs last for two or more days.
Thus the pricing varies from free to $900 per participant.

E. RESULTS Results Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· are divided into five areas based on the study objectives.
They are: Program Design and Implementation National and State Educational Standards Program Evaluation and Performance Measurement National or System-Wide Program or Activity Capacity Building
The findings and discussion that follow are based on the surveys and follow-up interviews of the staff, as well as a review of other coastal related educational programs.
While performing the analysis, the study team conducted several cluster analyses (Tukey post hoc) hoping to find two or three recurring distinct groups to categorize the Reserves and to determine specific needs and make recommendations according to their needs.
From the cluster analyses it is clear that no distinct groups are found.
This supports our earlier assessment that the differences among the Reserves is most likely due to their diverse group of state partners, and the status of the education system and political climate in each Reserve's state.
Program Design and Implementation Program design and implementation is a critical objective for this study.
Several study questions determine how programs are developed at each Reserve.
The key internal and external influences that affect K-12 and PTD program development are reported in this section.
One of the questions on the individual online survey asks each EC to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 equals not at all and 5 equals very much) "How important are the following in your decision to develop and offer this program?" There were seven factors in the question and their means are reported as follows: K-12 Programs Factor It is frequently requested It is part of a Reserve initiative It fits school district curriculum It fits and individual school's curriculum It has been done for a long time It meets funding agency's guidelines Conducted a needs assessment Mean 3.73 3.69 3.10 3.09 2.98 2.81 1.53
The two main influences for K-12 programs are it is frequently requested and it is part of a Reserve initiative.
To a lesser extent, ECs feel that school districts or individual school curriculum influence the development of their programs.
31
PTD Programs Factor It is part of a Reserve initiative It is frequently requested It fits school district curriculum It fits and individual school's curriculum It meets funding agency's guidelines It has been done for a long time Conducted a needs assessment
Mean 3.95 3.66 3.38 3.34 2.70 2.18 1.93
Similar to K-12 programs, PTD program's two main influences are it is part of a Reserve initiative and it is frequently requested, although reversed in importance.
To a lesser extent the factors it fits a school district or individual school curriculum influence the development of their programs.
To gain more detailed information about program development, some questions in the telephone interview focus on program ideas and target audience.
The telephone interview question "How do you come up with ideas for programs?" elicits these common responses from ECs: K-12 o o o o o o PTD o o o Programs Reserve research Tradition Teacher requests Adapt ideas from other Reserves Adapt ideas from other environmental education providers Informally determine gaps that need to be filled Programs In conjunction with a partner organization Specific funding determines program topic A steering committee or advisory board consisting of teachers, staff and in some cases volunteers
For both PTD and K-12 programs, needs assessments are not commonly used by Reserves to develop programs.
The question "What are the outside influences that determine the content of programs?" elicits these common EC responses about both K-12 and PTD programs: o Teachers frequently contact them to request specific programs o ECs contact other environmental education providers in the community to determine if there are gaps or niches that can be filled by the Reserve o Programming is based on the need to educate the community about a particular local conservation issue o The program has to meet a specific funding agency's requirements
32
Within the context of the same question, "What are the outside influences that determine the content of programs?" ECs report some factors that are valid and should be considered as internal influences on program development.
These include Reserve specific physical constraints such as: o Physical facilities available o The time of year that the Reserve could offer a program o The remoteness of the Reserve location Another aspect that guides program design is the target audience.
In the inventory summary section, results indicate that the sixth through eighth grade students and teachers are the most common target audiences for K-12 and PTD programs.
More detailed information is determined when each EC responded to the question, "How are target audiences for programs chosen?" For K-12 programs the determining factor is the flexibility to attend field trips.
Thus the largest audience is sixth through eighth grade students and the second largest target audience is fourth and fifth grade students.
Target audience selection for PTD programs is approached from two angles.
The first approach is to provide trainings for teachers who visit the Reserve with their students.
These workshops focus on training teachers to lead a portion of a program or an entire program at the Reserve.
The second approach targets specific grade levels for longer workshops (i.e. two days to a week).
These workshops are designed to give teachers knowledge on specific estuarine science and conservation topics.
An example of this type of workshop is the M.A.R.E. program that some Reserves provide, which gives teachers the tools to transform their elementary or middle schools into dynamic laboratories for the study of the ocean.
Since Reserves often partner with other organizations to offer these longer workshops, the partner and the Reserve together choose the specific target audience.
In the online survey results, the relative importance of K-12 programs is rated higher than PTD programs for increasing community support, understanding of estuaries, promoting stewardship, increasing awareness of the Reserve, and changing behaviors.
ECs common answers from follow-up telephone interviews are: o By having direct contact with students, they feel that their mission and goals are conveyed in a more effective manner o Tight state budgets and demand on teachers to cover state test objectives make it difficult to get them out of the classroom for even a half-day training o It is increasingly difficult to have weekend trainings because teachers cannot commit the time unless they receive a stipend Since these factors make it difficult to recruit teachers for training, in many cases ECs find that PTD is too time and labor intensive for the current number of teachers they reach.
The inventory summary section details the amount of time that education staff spends running K-12 and PTD programs.
In summary, on a scale of 1 to 10 (where 1 equals none
33
and 10 equals all) 54% of ECs rate the amount of time education staff spends running K12 programs as a 5 or less, meaning that they do not spend a lot of time running these programs.
In addition, 92% of ECs rate the amount of time education staff spends running PTD programs as a 4 or less, meaning that they do not spend a lot of time running these programs.
A Tukey HSD post hoc cluster analysis shows that three groups form with varying answers (Table 11).
Table 11.
Cluster Analysis of Time Spent Running Programs "How much time does education staff spend running ?" Group 1 (N=11) Group 2 (N=11) Medium High K-12 Low Low PTD Mean: Low = 1-3.33, Medium = 3.34-6.66, High = 6.67-10 Group 3(N=2) Low Medium
This indicates that about half of the Reserves (Group 2) focus exclusively on K-12 and not PTD.
Two Reserves (Group 3) spend more time on PTD and very little on K-12.
Overall, about half of the Reserves (Group 1) place less emphasis on these types of education programs, but favor K-12 over PTD.
The question "How do you keep current with new educational initiatives?" indicates the most common methods: o Attend conferences both in state and nationally o Subscribe to professional journals and newsletters o Subscribe to list servs and view internet sites o Sponsor environmental education events in the local community o Attend workshops o Network and share knowledge with other environmental education organizations o Learn about new initiatives from Americorp volunteers who are recent college graduates o Learn about new initiatives through established relationship with teachers
34
National and State Educational Standards National content-based standards for science literacy were developed and first published in 1993.
One hundred-fifty teachers and administrators from six school districts developed benchmarks for Science Literacy.
The focus for these standards was to develop a tool that educators in every state and school district could use to create their curricula to achieve literacy in science, mathematics, and technology for all students upon graduation from high school.1 From that initial movement, each state developed or is in the process of developing or redesigning its own set of content-based standards.
These standards are benchmarks that students must achieve.
There are standards for each grade level and for each subject.
Students' knowledge is determined by standardized tests designed to measure each benchmark.
Since this movement took place in the early 1990's many informal science institutions (i.e. science centers, zoos, nature centers, etc.) have designed their programs to correlate with the content-based standards in their state.
One of the objectives of this study is to determine if each Reserve correlates their programs to the standards in their state and to the national benchmarks.
On average ECs have moderate experience (5.27 on a 1-10 scale, where 1 equals no experience and 10 equals extensive experience) correlating programs to national and state education standards.
The median is a 5.0 indicating that about half of the respondents rate their experience in this area as a 5 or less and about half rate it above 5.
On closer inspection, over half (63%) rate their experience as a 6 or less (Fig. 21).

In the individual program analysis each EC reported whether or not each of their programs are correlated with state education standards and national education standards.
Most programs are not correlated to national standards, which is not surprising because school systems are ultimately held accountable to state standards (Fig. 22).
Nearly 60% of the programs are correlated to state standards, however more than 40% of the programs are not (Fig. 23).

Yes 67%
The question "For the programs that you have correlated to state and national standards, how were the correlations done?" reports that the program is developed and then state standards are identified and correlated to the program.
This happens in most cases because many Reserve programs are well established.
However, several also reported that for programs currently in development, they are working more closely with teachers to design them to meet state standards and fit the education system in their community.
Throughout the country, Reserves report that it is increasingly difficult to have students and teachers visit the Reserve for programs if they do not fulfill specific state standards.
This trend indicates that it is important for ECs and their education staff to work closely with schools and to keep current on education initiatives within their state.
36
Program Evaluation and Performance Measurement Approximately four Reserves reported that K-12 is not a focus at their Reserve or that they are creating new programs or redesigning their older programs.
There are approximately eight Reserves where PTD is not a priority and very little to no programming occurs.
Thus, at the time of the study no program evaluation is occurring at these sites.
As evidenced from the K-12 and PTD program summary section there is little formal evaluation occurring for most programs.
The most common forms of evaluation are staff observation and tracking participant attendance counts.
Thirty-one percent of the K-12 programs report having no formal evaluation, and only a quarter of the programs have any type of follow-up surveys, pre- and post-program surveys, or even feedback cards.
For PTD programs, 22% of the programs have no formal evaluation and less than half have follow-up surveys, pre- and post-program surveys, or feedback cards.
The responses to the question "For Reserve programs that have been formally evaluated what are the results of the evaluations?" indicate that many programs do not have formal evaluation results.
There is confusion about the definition of formal evaluation (noted in the methodology section.).
Some believe that formal evaluation is done by an outside party and others think that it is an evaluation with quantitative results.
For the purpose of the study, we are looking for quantitative results.
The main reasons for the lack of formal evaluation are: o Evaluation takes time away from other education responsibilities o ECs indicate that they do not have a lot of experience evaluating programs (72% rated this skill a 5 or less on a 10 point scale.)
The responses to the question "Overall, do you think that K-12 and PTD programs at your Reserve were successful?" indicate that most ECs believe their programs are successful enough based on subjective evaluation methods including monitoring the number of repeat visits, anecdotal feedback from teachers via discussion groups, individual conversations, focus groups, and meeting their capacity for K-12 programs.
Three Reserves mentioned that they conduct formal evaluations and have the data to prove their success, and that the informal feedback they have received from teachers, parents, and science supervisors are positive.
From the responses to the telephone survey, the success of professional teacher development is mixed.
In many cases the Reserves feel that it has been more difficult to recruit teachers in the past couple of years because budget cuts and the increased emphasis on meeting state standards decreases the amount of time that teachers spend away from the classroom for professional development.
Teachers also want stipends for participation in workshops.
Many Reserves believe they offer high quality programs but that the factors listed above hinder their success.
Some ECs express the need for marketing help at the local level to increase the visibility of Reserve programs, particularly in the case of PTD.
37
National or System-Wide Program or Activity Support for System-Wide Program or Activity In general there is support for a system-wide program or activity.
This section takes a look at this question from a variety of different angles.
The online survey rates ECs opinions on the different forms a national or system wide program or activity might take: o 67% of ECs agree that system-wide NERRS educational objectives would help them improve educational programs at their Reserve (those who answered 5 or above on a scale of 1 to 10, mean 5.92).
EC opinions are split on this item, with a cluster of responses around 4 and 5 and a cluster of responses around 9 and 10.
o 63% of ECs agree that a system-wide NERRS educational program(s) would help them improve educational programs at their Reserve (those who answered 5 or above on a scale of 1 to 10, mean 5.58).
EC opinions are split on this item, with a cluster of responses between 3 and 7 and a cluster of responses at 10.
o 58% of ECs agree that a system-wide NERRS educational curriculum would help them improve educational programs at their Reserve (those who answered 5 or above on a scale of 1 to 10, mean 5.38).
EC opinions are diverse.
As the results indicate, the averages are above 5 for every question, however the results are bi-modal for each question, signifying that the ECs perceive different needs and opportunities.
The follow-up interviews shed light on why there is so much disagreement in the initial survey.
ECs agree that it is helpful to create a national identity or focus for NERRS, but they also said that it would be difficult to find the commonalities among the Reserves because each site is so different.
If a national-level program is implemented, 75% of ECs indicate they would favor such a program, with the following caveats: o The program has a broad thematic program that could be localized o The program identifies unifying themes for Reserves and partners o The program uses NERRS strengths o The program matches current goals at each Reserve o The program is of interest to school districts o The Reserves have enough staff to implement the program o Opportunities are available for partners to implement the program o The program is strongly promoted by the national office o The program is similar to CTP (e.g., it has a defined NERRS/NOAA mission and budget category) o The program is supported with long-term resources ECs indicate a national-level NERRS curriculum or program might include: o Introductory materials that each Reserve could use as a springboard for their own site-specific programs o Creative national marketing strategies that focus on commonalities in programs and focus among Reserves o National PTD certification program
38

National standards Resources or other national programs that sites can participate in Great website Evaluation tools and methods
Several ECs mention that Estuary Live may be a good focus for a national curriculum effort.
What ECs did not want was a "top-down program" with a "canned curriculum" that would be irrelevant to their Reserve, their climate, or their season(s) of operation.
The 25% of ECs who did not favor adopting some kind of national program gave several reasons for their view, including that any new program would probably come at the expense of current programs and would likely not fit all Reserves.
Since some Reserves do not have K-12/PTD programs, and others have been cut, they believe a truly national program would not be feasible.
System-Wide Activities and Topics ECs feel that the following activities and topics that would be most appropriate for a national program: A. Educational methods B. Estuarine/environmental topics C. Marketing/communications A. Educational methods that would be appropriate for a national program include experiential programs (e.g. restoration efforts, seine netting), web-based programs, comparative programs between Reserves, PTD programs that are designed to address specific identified needs, science-based programs for secondary grades (e.g. based on SWMP data, salt marsh monitoring), programs that target a specific grade level, and system-wide program evaluation tools.
ECs mention several programs that are appropriate models or venues for a national curriculum effort including Estuary Live, MARE, and Rivers Meet The Sea.
B. ECs indicate that these estuarine and environmental topics are appropriate for a national program: o Estuaries- physical properties, functions, ecology o Nekton- biological properties o Estuaries- value, resource appreciation o Estuaries- stewardship and protection o Water quality and water pollution o Watersheds o Invasive species o Migratory species o Near-shore ecosystems o Oceanography o National environmental issues as they apply to local issues
39
C. ECs would like a national program to address several marketing and communications to: develop promotional items for each Reserve's use; develop and maintain a resource-based website; and provide national "introductory" materials (e.g., video or map of system) that explain why the Reserves exist and what this national network does to protect the environment.
System-Wide Niche The study also investigates what niche a system-wide or national program might fill.
There are already a number of coastal and marine environmental programs and curriculums.
Appendix 1 lists all of the programs that ECs identified during the surveys as well others that were found during the project.
While there are many unique and interesting programs, most reflect the mission of the sponsoring organization or a pressing coastal issue.
The NERRS' unique role of Research Reserves suggests that using original research in their programs could be a niche for a system-wide or national program.
The suggestion is confirmed by the ECs responses to what made their programs different from other coastal-based educational programs.
They rate the degree to which the following factors differentiate Reserve educational programs from other coastal educational programs on a scale of 1 to 10 (where 1 equals not at all different and 10 equals very different).
The following show the results with means greater than five.
Question We integrate research from the Reserve into programs Our programs provide access to unique coastal areas We integrate Reserve scientists in our programs Our programs have Reserve-specific curriculum Our instructors are coastal scientists % Rated Above 5/Mean 96% / 8.09 82% / 6.68 76% / 6.43 76% / 6.33 67% / 5.52
Integrating research in their programs is perceived to be the biggest differentiating factor, however NERRS programs also differ because they use scientists in their programs as instructors or resource people.
Most Reserves are fortunate to have access to unique coastal areas and most programs integrate those outdoor settings into their programs.
These are key differences that should be translated into strengthening Reserve programs and creating a national niche.
If research is to become a niche for NERRS K-12 and PTD, an area of emphasis or improvement might be to have program participants contribute to ongoing research.
Based on a review of other national programs, this would be a significant difference and it is something that ECs currently rank the lowest as a differentiating factor (43% / 4.62).
40
Capacity Building Activity To look at capacity building for NERRS K-12 and PTD programs, a very broad definition is used.
For the purposes of this study, capacity building is any activity or resource that might assist K-12 and PTD programs.
This includes strengthening partnerships, program support, communication, funding, and training.
Partnerships Through the online survey, ECs rate how partnerships could help improve their programs.
There is strong agreement about the positive impact of partnerships: o 83% of ECs agree that cooperation with outside partners to develop programs would help them improve educational programs at their Reserve (those who answered 5 or above on a scale of 1 to 10, mean 6.75).
EC opinions on this item are clustered around 5 and 8 and at 10.
o 83% of ECs agree that cooperation with outside partners to run programs would help them improve educational programs at their Reserve (those who answered 5 or above on a scale of 1 to 10, mean 6.46).
EC opinions on this item are clustered around 3 and 5, 7 and 8, and at 10.
o 75% of ECs agree that cooperation with outside partners to fund programs would help them improve educational programs at their Reserve (those who answered 5 or above on a scale of 1 to 10, mean 6.96).
EC opinions on this item are clustered at 3, at 7 and 8, and at 10.
o 71% of ECs agree that cooperation with outside partners to obtain funding for programs would help them improve educational programs at their Reserve (those who answered 5 or above on a scale of 1 to 10, mean 6.67).
EC opinions on this item are clustered at 3, and at 8 and 10.
In the follow-up interviews, partnerships are mentioned frequently as a key aspect in delivering K-12 and PTD programs.
Partnerships are also mentioned as something that a system-wide program could help to encourage.
Partnerships are used by Reserves in several major ways to: gain or share resources, build programs, and build relationships.
Of the ECs who said that they use partnerships, a majority (56%) use partnerships to gain or share resources for funding (programs, salaries), people (staff, volunteers), facilities (classrooms, dorms), equipment (canoes, boats, lab materials), education or training materials, time, audience mailing lists, and transportation services.
A few Reserves (12%) use partnerships to build relationships with the community and with other organizations.
These partnership opportunities did not necessarily gain resources or programmatic support for a Reserve, but probably provide long-term benefits in goodwill development.
Relationship building included serving on advisory boards, working closely with schools, and working to build a community constituency for the Reserve.
A third of the Reserves (36%) use partnerships specifically to: build better programs, work together, outsource delivery of K-12 and PTD programs, avoid overlapping
41
programs, build or "piggyback" programs on each other, develop and deliver joint programs, and enhance program marketing and PR efforts The positive aspects of partnering cited by ECs include increased resources; the ability to access and serve larger audiences; the ability to accomplish more with less time and effort (or that you would not be able to accomplish alone); the selection of partners who add certain expertise or a different perspective; increased visibility and community goodwill; the joint use of well-trained volunteers; and the ability to prevent turf disputes.
The negative aspects of partnering cited by ECs include difficulty in planning and executing partnerships; differing missions, objectives, and needs among partners; unequal distribution of money or resources; lack of control of the process and product; and a host of logistical problems, such as communication difficulties, time management, increased demand for meetings, and personality conflicts.
ECs also identify three different categories that would improve their use of partnerships: A. Identifying overall guidelines for effective partnering B. Effectively addressing resource/logistics needs C. Increase programming opportunities through distance or joint programming A. Identifying overall guidelines for effective partnering would allow ECs to use partnerships at the optimal level, including finding the right person or organization to partner with, identifying new partners or renewing ties with partners that have fallen by the wayside, using the market analyses to find program overlaps and niches, and getting partnerships to be more beneficial and symbiotic overall.
B. ECs say that partnerships can be used more effectively to address program and resource/logistic needs.
Increased funding levels, improved training for staff and volunteers, increased communication, and enhanced overall use of program time would enhance their capabilities to deliver programs.
C. ECs said that partnerships could be used to increase programming opportunities through distance programming or joint programming.
They could accomplish this by finding partners to host off-site programs or share hosting duties, finding partners to teach programs that the EC cannot, and finding partners to expand the Reserves' reach to new audiences.
An example that one EC mentions is seeking more opportunities to partner with universities and community colleges.
Program Support The Reserves Managers are generally supportive of the ECs and their education programs.
The question "In what ways does the Reserve Manager help you?" illustrates that RMs primarily assist with operations and administrative needs (Fig. 24).
Reserve Managers are generally supportive of ECs, while supporting the autonomy of ECs to manage their own areas of responsibility.
For ease of reporting, the variety of responses is categorized into four areas: operations, communications, administrative, and other (Table 12).
42
The RMs responses to the same question about what roles they play in K-12 and PTD correspond to the ECs responses.

Long-term vision and guidance Coaching of education staff Problem solving
Communication Within Reserves Many ECs feel that increased communication with RCs would improve education programs.
The Reserve staff at each site is small and the workload is great.
It is often easy for staff to become narrowly focused on their area.
Communication between staff occurs at all of the sites, but in many cases only when a specific need arises.
Reserve staff have different perceptions of the role K-12 and PTD programs play in helping the Reserves meet their overall objectives.
ECs, SCs, RCs, and RMs are asked about the relative importance of K-12 and PTD in increasing community support for estuarine conservation, increasing understanding of estuarine ecosystems, promoting stewardship of estuaries, increasing citizen awareness of the Reserve, and changing behaviors.
There is a general feeling that K-12 plays a greater role in meeting these Reserve objectives than PTD programs do.
Out of those surveyed, SCs feel the strongest that K-12 and PTD programs meet Reserve objectives.
They consistently rate all of these categories the highest of the group surveyed.
ECs feel strongly that K-12 programs assist with meeting the different objectives, but they do not feel PTD programs meet these needs as well.
The areas that received the highest scores from all groups for both PTD and K-12 are increasing understanding of estuarine ecosystems and promoting stewardship of estuaries.
ECs have the largest difference in their scores for promoting stewardship of estuaries, with PTD programs receiving a mean of 6.61 and K-12 receiving a mean of 8.46.
From previous discussion in the program implementation and design section, K-12 is rated higher because ECs feel that there are tangible benefits from teaching K-12 students
44
directly and they are able to measure knowledge.
ECs believe that they do not have the resources to follow-up with teachers after workshops to see if they understand the material and to find out how they will use the material in their classroom.
ECs also stated that many teachers are not interested or comfortable teaching this material to their students.
Teachers have many different demands on their time and have less time to learn new subject matter.
Therefore, teachers feel that the kids benefit from the Reserve education staff's instruction.
Working with "experts" such as the Reserve education instructors, students are given the opportunities to explore possible careers as well as the chance to learn accurate information from instructors who have specialized training.
Table 13 and 14 show that all key staff rate K-12 and PTD as relatively important for achieving Reserve goals, indicating that there is relatively strong support for both K-12 and PTD.
However, K-12 is viewed as more important to achieving Reserve goals rather than PTD.

Similar to the other questions, the results for this question vary among ECs.
The following are some of the results: o Better communication among Reserves about programs: 41% of ECs do not feel like this would help them with their programs (score of 5 or below).
37% rate this an 8, 9, or 10.
o Cooperation with other Reserves to run programs: The mean for this question is very low, 4.58 and 67% of ECs rate this a 5 or below.
o Cooperation with Reserves to fund programs: This mean is a 5.00 with 29% feeling this is important (rating 8, 9, or 10) and 56% giving it a 5 or below.
o Cooperation with other Reserves to develop programs: This mean is also low (5.13) although 41% of ECs rate it a 7, 8, or 10.
o Cooperation with other Reserves to obtain funding for programs: 33% feel this would be helpful and rate it an 8, 9, or 10, and 43% rate it a 5 or less.
These results show that ECs are split on their feelings about inter-Reserve support.
When a Tukey HSD post hoc cluster analysis was run on the data to determine if different groups of ECs emerged with varied preferences, three groups formed.
Group 3 has significantly higher means for each answer than the other two groups.
Group 3 (consisting of eleven Reserves) indicates that they are interested in working with other Reserves to improve programs.
The remaining Reserves have less interest in working together nationally.
Members of group 3 consistently rate the 7, 8, 9, or 10 responses (Table 15).

Reserve Level Support Results indicate the areas where ECs would like more support for their education programs.
Surprisingly, they do not indicate that they want more support from volunteers.
This is possibly because volunteers are not utilized as often for K-12 and PTD programs as they are for other needs such as public education programs.
K-12 and PTD programs are more often taught by trained educators as opposed to volunteers who are utilized in other areas of the Reserve.
In some cases ECs would like volunteers, but do not have the time to recruit, maintain, and train a volunteer force to help with educational programs.
ECs identify that these areas need the most support: 1) securing funds for programs and 2) increasing communication about Reserve research.
Because the results are so mixed on this question regarding Reserve-level support for PTD and K-12 programs, we ran a Tukey HSD post hoc cluster analysis to determine if groups emerged from the data that had similar preferences.
Three groups formed.
Group 1 consists of ten Reserves and this group rates all of the questions lowest, indicating that they do not feel they need much support from within their Reserve.
Group 3 contains 11 Reserves and rates the questions highest, expressing a need for assistance from within the Reserve.
All of the results between groups 1 and 3 were statistically significant except for volunteer need (Table 16).

National Support ECs showed mixed interest in working together on a national level.
The question, "Please indicate the degree the following types of support from the national office would help you improve educational programs at your Reserve" includes five areas: "System-wide NERRS educational program(s), system-wide NERRS educational curriculum(s), systemwide NERRS educational objectives, better communication with the national office, and National office assistance with securing outside funding.
ECs indicate that they want assistance securing outside funding, and they are not of one mind concerning system-wide NERRS education programs, system-wide education curriculum, or improving communication with the national office.
Since the results are so diverse on this question regarding national office support for Reserves, a Tukey HSD cluster analysis was conducted to determine if groups emerged from the data with similar preferences.
Three groups formed.
Group 2, containing ten Reserves, is most interested in receiving support from the national office in all areas.
Group 3 consists of eight Reserves and gives the lowest scores, indicating that they feel less of a need for national support than the other Reserves.
The answers between groups 2 and 3 were statistically significant (Table 17).
Group 1, containing six Reserves rates each area as medium, meaning there is some interest in receiving support from the national office in these areas.

Funding Funding is a key factor identified by ECs that could improve capacity at their Reserves.
While this is not a novel discovery, the types of funding and the uses for the funding show some important results.
ECs were asked about the types of funding they feel would help them improve education programs at their Reserves (Fig. 25).
They rated each type of support on a scale of 1-10.
All of the means are over 5, however the response that received the highest amount of interest is the need for more paid education staff to assist with programs (8.96 mean).
The next two highest categories are teacher stipends (7.19) and transportation (7.13), which suggests that ECs think providing incentives to teachers or schools will increase enrollment in their programs.

Program design
Although Figure 25 illustrates the overall means for the different Reserves, when the data is clustered, three groups are apparent.
Group 2 represents the Reserves indicating that funding is a high priority in every a category of need while the other two groups have less needs or were able to better distinguish their priorities (Table 18).

Since paid education staff and teacher stipends, have the highest mean scores, greater detail is needed to explain their choices.
ECs rated these highly because they feel that with more education staff they can provide more programs to reach more students and teachers, increase their menu of offerings, improve the safety aspects of the program, and give them the ability to target new and underserved audiences.
In addition, some of the Reserves have staff that can focus on a particular age group.
More Reserves want staff available to focus on specific grade levels, for example a staff person to focus on K-8 and one to focus on High school, college, and PTD.
This would give staff the opportunity to focus on a smaller audience and learn about the specific needs of that audience.
In addition, different types of staff are requested.
As discussed earlier, some ECs need part-time administrative assistance, some request a full or part-time volunteer coordinator, and some request full or part-time marketing assistance.
ECs indicate that funding for teacher stipends would help attract teachers to their workshops and trainings.
Some Reserves feel that it is absolutely necessary because development and training is part of a teacher's responsibility and they should be paid for their services.
In some cases teachers are used to teach PTD programs and respondents believe they should be compensated for their services.
Some respondents favor an education fellowship similar to a scientific fellowship that can focus on a specific task such as program development, coordination of a specific initiative, or even an evaluation project.
Graduate students could serve as education fellows, students could gain valuable experience, and the Reserves could gain added resources for specific tasks.
Sixty-two percent believe their current funding levels are adequate to maintain their current programming while 33% do not.
Seventy-nine percent disagree that there is adequate funding to increase their current allotment.
Training Continued EC training (mean 7.08) is also an important factor to improve programs.
The question "How much experience do you have doing the following?" asks ECs to rate their experience level in various tasks (Table 19).
To gain detailed insight, a Tukey HSD post hoc cluster analysis separated the Reserves into three groups.
Two Reserves did not answer this question.
Comparisons of the clustered means for each group were analyzed.

Training in evaluation, marketing, and correlating programs to standards are three important areas that a training program can address.
ECs indicate the degree to which the following types of training would help improve educational programs at their Reserve.
In addition, some insight is gained from the question "How do you keep current with educational initiatives?" and was also used to interpret the responses.
A Tukey Post hoc cluster analysis determined three groups requesting specific types of trainings (Table 20).
Group 1 rates most training types as medium with the exception of program assessment and evaluation (high).
This group can be described as having already had moderate training or experience in all of these areas or they do not have the time or resources to devote to training.
Group 2 rates most training types as low, which indicates that they either do not need or already had training, were not encouraged to seek training opportunities, or do not have extensive time available for training.
Group 3 rated every category as high, which indicates that they are very open and supportive of training in all forms.
The four areas that are rated the highest by all groups are training for program evaluation and assessment, ecological knowledge/skills, educational standards testing, and proposal writing and fundraising.

F. RECOMMENDATIONS The following recommendations arise from the analysis of the online surveys, the phone interviews and the site visits with the ECs and the other NERRS staff members.
This project is designed to inventory the current status of K-12 and PTD programs within NERRS and to provide baseline data and trends data for system-wide consideration of a possible niche or signature program potential for NERRS in this arena, as well as recommendations for improvements of current programs.
All those surveyed and interviewed, including RMs, RCs, SCs, and other staff recognize the value of K-12 and PTD and support current programming efforts.
However, there are unequal levels of commitment and resources at the Reserves for K-12 and PTD; some ECs are fighting to maintain K-12 and PTD programs while others are well supported.
If K-12 and PTD programs are important to NERRS at a system-wide or national level, they should not continue to be unevenly supported and act as semi-autonomous units accountable only to their state partners and RMs.
There should be more support and coordination on a system-wide level.
NERRS is a unique organization with many strengths.
NERRS' mission, structure, and diversity give it the potential to be a leader in estuarine education on a national level.
Reserve Level Recommendations Recommendation 1: Develop an EC Position Description ECs have a complex and unique job based on their multiple roles and responsibilities.
It is important to develop a description of EC qualifications and duties that could be used as a guide for future hiring, specifically at proposed Reserves to create consistency across the system.
This description should have some broad qualifications and duties that could be integrated with Reserve-specific qualifications and responsibilities.
ECs play the role of liaison between the researchers at the Reserve and the teachers in the community.
Therefore, their level of science knowledge will be key to help them interpret scientific material for their target audience.
ECs should be "science educators," meaning they must be able to take the scientific information from the research and stewardship programs and synthesize it into a format that is understandable for K-12 and PTD audiences.
This includes strong knowledge in both science and education.
This is different from the term "science teacher" because ECs fulfill a different role than a classroom teacher.
They act as a science resource or "expert" providing information to teachers on estuarine topics, but at the same time they must know current education initiatives so that they can talk the same language and provide a service to teachers that is of value.
There should be specific training each year to help ECs keep current with the changes in education.
54
Recommendation 2: Provide Training for ECs The in-depth interviews revealed that some ECs do not make time for professional development, and it is evident that ECs do not always have allotted resources (both time and money) set aside for professional development in science education methods, constructivism, and science topics and skills including evaluation, correlating programs with standards, and grant writing.
The creation of an annual development plan for each EC that builds on their key strengths and identifies areas for further development would help each EC to increase their expertise in both estuarine science and education.
ECs should also participate in the plan's creation by determining specific professional development opportunities for themselves and present a proposal to their RM so that they may expand their professional capabilities.
Annual EC national and regional meetings provide a perfect opportunity for both education and estuarine science training opportunities.
Adding an extra day or half-day training to the meeting agenda to provide specific training would be beneficial to ECs. ECs also indicate that at these meetings they would like time to share their successes and failures with educational programming.
Some time might be allotted to discuss specific topics for programming at each meeting, such as evaluation, teacher recruitment, and program development.
Specific topics could be determined beforehand and ECs could prepare their materials ahead of time to make efficient use of allotted meeting time.
Recommendation 3: Increase Paid Education Staff As reported in the program inventory section, most Reserves have a very limited education staff.
The education staff has many program responsibilities including the Coastal Training Program, Coastal Decision Makers Workshops, and public programs.
In addition, ECs have administrative and overall operations responsibilities that take over half of their time.
In some cases, ECs are asked to be acting Reserve Managers or Assistant Reserve Managers.
It is increasingly difficult for ECs to teach, create, update, and evaluate their K-12 and PTD offerings without additional support.
During the telephone interviews, ECs were asked, "How would funding for more paid educational staff improve your educational programs?" ECs said more staff would allow them to run safer programs and increase program attendance: they also need staff to create a wider variety of programs to target other grade levels or to develop new curriculum.
Some ECs are consumed with the marketing aspects of their programs and indicated that a part-time administrative assistant or a marketing specialist would help them increase visibility for the Reserve, while freeing them to focus on education-related tasks.
55
In some cases it is difficult for the national office to help with staffing issues because there are specific guidelines for hiring in each state.
It is important to identify the Reserves that need staff and determine if it can be pursued on a federal level or state level.
In addition, if priorities are shifted through the market/needs assessment (See Recommendation 7), or if the system-wide program planning (See Recommendation 10) causes some Reserves to be more focused, the need for additional staff may be reduced.
Recommendation 4: Secure Outside Funding for K-12 and PTD Programs Over 84% of all K-12 and PTD programs are funded by internal budgets.
ECs indicate that they are interested in finding outside funding to increase or improve Reserve programs.
At the state level, Reserves can look for grants from private foundations such as the Ocean Fund, or regional foundations that support specific regions or issues.
There are many resources listing foundations that can provide assistance, including the Directory of Environmental Grantmaking.
The public library system has resources to facilitate a search for grant support.
In addition, Reserves should continue to explore opportunities to partner with other organizations, companies, and agencies in their community for funding sources.
National Level Recommendations Recommendation 5: Hire a National K-12 and PTD Education Coordinator; Secure Direct and Consistent Funding for any New System-wide K-12 and PTD Programming If there is a commitment to K-12 and PTD programs from a system-wide standpoint, a central coordinator position needs to be established.
Individual ECs currently take the lead on system-wide initiatives with assistance from the national office, however, as evidenced by this assessment, most ECs are over-extended.
The coordinator would take the leadership role on any national or system-wide program(s), including design and implementation of the evaluation and performance measurement framework.
The coordinator would be able to focus on the big picture while using the input and direction from the Reserve ECs for any initiatives taken.
Most ECs believe that K-12 and PTD programming is at or above capacity at their Reserves and that if there are new system-wide programs initiated, there also needs to be additional funding for those programs.
56
Recommendation 6: Provide Assistance to Reserves to Secure Outside Funding The national office or the national education coordinator could serve as a repository for funding opportunities.
It would also be advantageous for certain grants or proposals if Reserves could use other NERRS programs as backup experience for grant applications.
The national office could keep a database of template proposal sections to streamline the grant writing process.
In addition, if a system-wide program is initiated, the national coordinator could serve as the lead to write proposals for grants to other federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Science Foundation, as well as private funding sources.
The National Science Foundation also awards planning grants of $50,000 for informal science education projects.
This may be an excellent source of funding to explore a national initiative.
The existing close relationship with the National Estuarine Research Reserve Association (NERRA) should be maintained as a potential mechanism for channeling funds that are granted only to non-profits.
Recommendation 7: Maintain a Database of Examples of NERRS K-12 and PTD Programs Maintaining a database of examples of successful NERRS K-12 and PTD programs and "lessons learned" is more manageable and sustainable with today's technology.
The database could be stored on a NERRS K-12 and PTD website for ECs.
A separate website for the public could help market the programs.
Recommendation 8: Provide Assistance to Correlate all NERRS Programs to State Educational Standards In most states, educators are under increasing pressure to document that they are teaching to the state educational standards.
National standards are not a critical factor for most educators.
Although ECs can be trained to correlate programs to state standards themselves, their workload prevents this from being a high priority.
The presentation of uncorrelated programs or curricula can become a barrier for student and teacher participation.
Correlating programs and curricula to state standards will increase the likelihood that educators will use the materials, come to PTD trainings, and bring their students to Reserve K-12 programs.
Depending on the complexity of the standards, the process can be tedious and may require outside assistance or training.
State correlations
57
should also be done if a system-wide program is implemented or if there is a national effort to offer programs in states where Reserves do not exist.
Recommendation 9: Establish National Performance Measures and Reserve Level Goals and Objectives The national office, with EC input, should develop key national goals that are important and applicable throughout NERRS, and then tie them to measurable objectives.
At the Reserve level, the national office should assist with the development of goals and objectives that would relate to each Reserve's particular target audiences.
The objectives could be knowledge, attitude, or action based.
The Reserves could mirror state benchmarks or standards for their objectives.
Currently there are no system-wide measures of whether K-12 and PTD programs are effective.
Table 21 gives an example of how this might be done.
Table 21.
Example of National and Reserve Level Goal Setting National Goal National Objective Reserve Goal(s) Reserve Elementary School Objectives Reserve Middle School Objectives Reserve High School Objectives Reserve PTD Objectives Increase awareness of the vital role of estuaries in coastal ecosystems.
The public will be able to identify the roles of an estuary.
Increase awareness in the local community that Padilla Bay is a major stopover site for migratory birds 75% of the students will be able to match a description of local migratory bird to its picture.
75% of the students will able to list two migratory birds that use Padilla Bay as a stopover site.
75% of the students will be able to identify four migratory birds by sight.
Increase awareness in the local community that Padilla Bay is the nursery for Puget Sound's commercial fishing industry Students will demonstrate they understand that Padilla Bay is a nursery by drawing a picture of a Padilla Bay ecosystem.
75% of the students will be able to identify two key human impacts to the nursery
75% of the students will be able to list two key actions they can take to reduce human impacts to the nursery.
100% of educators will be able meet the objective for the grade level they teach.
75% of the participants will implement the curriculum or activities to teach the different objectives.
A Reserve goal may correspond directly to an individual program or set of programs.
There also may be more than one objective for a particular goal.
It would not be necessary to measure every objective for a particular goal, but rather to focus on measuring high-priority objectives.
58
Recommendation 10: Develop and Implement an Evaluation Framework that Would Measure Factors at a National Level and Reserve Level There is no established evaluation framework at the national level and only a few Reserves consistently evaluate their programs.
It is important that Reserves define the level and types of formal evaluation that would be most useful and then create an efficient and consistent plan to evaluate their programs.
This commitment to evaluation will document effectiveness and establish whether programs are meeting the needs of target audiences and the funding agencies (i.e. private foundations, EPA, NSF).
A formal evaluation framework will help focus K-12 and PTD efforts at a national and Reserve level.
This could increase cooperation within and between Reserves, as well as increase the likelihood of obtaining additional funding for K-12 and PTD programs at a national and Reserve level.
After establishing goals and objectives (See Recommendation 9), the evaluation framework would outline the important program data that would be collected at a national level (e.g. number of participants, number of programs, target audience, teacher/participant satisfaction, national program effectiveness).
Then the Reserve goals and objectives should be used to determine the evaluation framework at the Reserve level.
This framework could be designed to capture data needed for specific grants or reporting purposes.
Each Reserve would use their own data from the Reserve-specific objectives to demonstrate how the national objectives were being met.
The framework would outline processes, timeframes, and responsibilities for measuring the objectives and collecting the data.
It would be the primary responsibility of the national coordinator (See Recommendation 5) to coordinate and analyze the data supplied by the Reserves.
Recommendation 11: Provide Assistance for a K-12 and PTD Market Analysis and Needs Assessment for Newer Reserves or Reserves Interested in Re-assessing Their Programs Reserves are offering a wide array of K-12 and PTD programs and some are very well established while others are just starting up.
A market analysis and needs assessment would assist Reserves in the development of effective programs, the development of an evaluation and performance measurement framework, and participation in a system-wide program (See Recommendation 10).
59
Recommendation 12: Provide Assistance for a PTD Market Analysis and Needs Assessment for Reserves that Offer or Want to Offer PTD Programs ECs say that it has been a challenge to get educators to attend PTD programs.
Effective PTD programs potentially can reach significantly more students than K-12 programs, considering that one educator can reach 20 to 300 students per year depending on the grade level they teach.
Educators are always looking for quality programs and curricula.
The challenge for PTD programs is attracting educators and packaging materials that can be easily used in the classroom.
In addition, consideration should be given to reaching education students who will be entering the classroom.
Table 22 contains sample assessment questions.
Table 22.
Sample Questions to Help Develop an Effective PTD program o o o o o o o Which grade levels are interested in attending workshops? How does my program currently fit into the state/community school district? How can my program be a better fit for the school system? What types of materials best suit teachers' needs? What is the key factor that allows teacher participation in the Reserve workshops? What key factors are principals/administrators looking for in PTD programs? What are the best times and locations for workshops? Recommendation 13: Continue National Marketing to Support Local K-12 and PTD Initiatives ECs indicate that they appreciate national marketing materials and efforts, such as posters, videos, and brochures about NERRS and estuaries.
ECs want more done to supplement their programs or market any system-wide program.
There is also a desire for a central NERRS K-12 and PTD website that could be a link among Reserve programs and any national program.
Marketing will be especially important if a system-wide program is established.
Recommendation 14: Develop and Offer a System-Wide NERRS K-12 and PTD Program Focused on Field-based Estuarine Research Many Reserve educational initiatives already integrate Reserve research and a majority of ECs (96%) indicate that research is a differentiating factor for their K-12 and PTD programs.
There are many organizations offering coastal and marine K-12 and PTD
60
education (See Appendix 1), but few of them are filling an estuarine education niche with a research basis.
As the name states, NERRS is a system of Estuarine Research Reserves.
It makes sense that field-based estuarine research be the focus for a system-wide K-12 and PTD program.
Table 23 demonstrates how this type of concept could be translated to different grade levels using an awareness to action type model for environmental education.
Table 23.
Concept for National Estuarine Research Education Niche Curriculum and Example Activities Program Focus Touch tanks, models, field trips.
Elementary Exploratory and discovery Scientific process and Transect maps, beach profiles, Middle monitoring turbidity measurement.
Basic scientific process, data collection, and analysis.
Monitoring and Hypothesis/Testing, water quality High research development testing and comparisons, School Sedimentation comparison studies.
Advanced data collection, analysis, sharing scientific data such as SWMP data, reporting research results.
Awareness Knowledge Attitudes Skills Participation
Most ECs were in favor of a system-wide program but with a number of important caveats that include: o Ability to adapt to local conditions.
o Commitment of long-term support and resources o Strong national office promotion and support There is great potential for an effective national program within NERRS but there will have to be national level coordination and support with guidance from the ECs.
It is imperative to recognize Reserve independence and input in the process, but it is also important for ECs to recognize that an effective national program could significantly benefit them.
The benefits might include more support from professional staff, more funding, more attention and attendance at Reserve programs, shared resources among Reserves, and more focus for current programs.
A national program should be a shift in focus rather than a supplanting of or wholesale change of current programs.

Students and classes can register to view the broadcast over the Internet and submit questions to be asked live during the broadcasts.
Participating Reserves include North Carolina, Jacques Cousteau, and South Slough.
Estuary Net--Estuary Net is a high school water quality monitoring program first implemented by the NERRS several years ago; the program has lost funding, but was important to the educational programming at the North Inlet-Winyah NERR, and they have modified it somewhat and still use classroom, field/hands-on, and follow-up activities with several area high schools.
The reserve staff provides teachers with curriculum and sampling equipment, they visit classrooms for presentations on water quality issues, teach students to use test equipment in the lab and in the field and they select sample sites to monitor and then submit their findings to the Reserve.
MARE (Marine Activities Resources and Education)--MARE is an interdisciplinary K-8 whole school change program that engages teachers, students, parents, administrators, and the community to transform elementary and middle schools into dynamic laboratories for the study of the ocean.
MARE is a supplemental curriculum, designed to enrich science instruction for all students while promoting equity, language acquisition and academic excellence among English language learners.
The MARE curriculum focuses each grade level on a different ocean habitat.
Individual teachers at MARE schools use the thematic curriculum at their own pace throughout the year as a
64
vehicle to coordinate and integrate their science instruction.
At each grade level, the MARE habitat curriculum provides a minimum of 10 weeks worth of inquiry-based hands-on activities, covering an integrated treatment of earth

NEW YORK Organization: New York Sea Grant Program: Hudson River Estuary Summer Course Age Level: Middle and High School Website: http://www.seagrant.sunysb.edu/NYSG@30/education.htm The course is interdisciplinary, focusing on Hudson River ecology, cultural history and current social and economic issues.
Field trips for the course - from which students are required to write related lesson plans to be used in their own classrooms - have included visits to Hudson Valley historic sites, environmental education centers, power generation and sewage treatment plants and Hudson River marinas and riverbank parks.
Students experience the river as a living classroom, monitoring water quality in the Hudson's tidal marshes and creeks, beach seining and cruising the river's main stem on board research and educational vessels.
In its first two years, over 30 teachers participated, including those employed by Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam Counties and New York City.
About one half of the students teach science in New York's public schools.
Organization: Hudson River Sloop Clearwater Program: Classroom of the Waves 
All voyages on the Clearwater-- whether for groups of adults or school children, for Clearwater members of the public-- share similar elements.
On a typical day, the passengers assemble at the dock for a brief
72
orientation to the boat and crew.
Once underway, an otter trawl is set to gather specimens for the fish tank.
Then it's all hands to the halyards to help hoist the sails.
Following sail raising, different learning stations can include fish, plankton, invertebrates, sediments, water chemistry, steering and sailing the vessel, navigation and a variety of other topics.
Time is set aside during the sail for the entire group to come together to learn about Clearwater's history and mission.
A highlight of nearly all sails is a period of silence allowing everyone to reflect on aspects of the boat, river, and life they have seen while under sail.
Music by the crew may follow the silence, and passengers join in songs about sailing and environmental concerns helping to bring a sense of community to the day.
The Tideline Discovery Program is a hands-on learning experience offered on the Hudson's shores from March to November.
It enables students to embrace the many educational possibilities offered by our magnificent river.
Program content and activities vary depending on grade level and topics of interest to the teacher.
The program includes one classroom visit by a Clearwater educator and an interactive field trip to the river's shore.
Typically, during the initial classroom visit, a Clearwater educator introduces students to the river's ecology, history, and environmental issues through a slide presentation and discussion.

Appendix 2: General On-line Survey for ECs
77
General Survey Instrument for Reserve Education Coordinators (Electronic Survey) This survey is a part of the project to inventory and assess the K-12 and professional teacher development (PTD) programs for NERRS.
As a part of the project you will be asked to complete this general survey concerning overall education programs.
We will also ask you to complete a survey for each of the current K-12 and PTD programs done at your Reserve.
Following the surveys we will be conducting phone interviews to gather additional information.
The questions correspond to the project objectives and to some additional objectives requested at the annual meeting in October at Cape Cod.
The project objectives include: Â· Â· Â· Â· An inventory and assessment, both quantitative and qualitative, of current programming for K-12 and professional teacher development across the 25 reserves and how these programs integrate state and national standards; Recommendations for improved program evaluation and performance measurement; Recommendations for improving program design and implementation, as well as needs for national-level support and capacity building activity; Recommendations and associated implications for a national "niche" or systemwide program or activity in the areas of K-12 education and professional teacher development.
Please complete and return the general survey and the individual program survey by January 10, 2003.
For this project the following definitions apply: A program is a class, course, workshop, seminar, set of materials, curriculum, field trip, presentation, etc. where learning is the primary objective for the participants (students or educators).
A brochure, interpretive signs, or exhibit are not a program but could be part of a program.
A K-12 program is a program that is specifically developed for K-12 age students (public/private school, home school).
It does not include programs developed for general audiences where K-12 students are not the primary target group or programs for youth who are not attending as a part of a school related program.
For example an interpretive walk designed for third grade classes is K-12 program but an interpretive walk led for general visitors on weekends is not a K-12 program.
If your Reserve has a learning center, the learning center and its exhibits are not a K-12 program but a program may utilize the learning center as one of its components.
A professional teacher development (PTD) program is a program that is specifically developed for teachers that work with K-12 students.
Participants include public, private, and home-school educators.
78
A current program is a program that was run in the past 12 months or will be run in the next 12 months.

Appendix 3: On-line Individual Survey for ECs
83
Individual Program Survey for Education Coordinators (electronic) This survey should be completed after filling out the General Survey.
The General Survey asked you to list all of your Reserve's K-12 and Professional Teacher Development programs.
This Individual Program survey gathers the specific information about each one of the programs you listed in the General Survey.
We need for you to please fill out ONE survey for EACH program.
This Individual Program Survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.
For each program you will need to return to the on-line survey and start from the beginning.
There are three different ways to complete each survey.
1) Complete the survey on-line.
The one consideration for completing the survey on-line is that you cannot save the survey and come back later.
Although there is no time limit to complete the survey because the survey can remain on your screen as long as you maintain your Internet connection, if you for some reason cannot finish and you disconnect from the page, you will have lost all your work.
2) Print out a copy of the survey for each program and fill out the survey by hand.
You can either fax the surveys to us at (352) 372-4714 or you can mail them to: Pandion Systems, Inc. 5200 NW 43rd Street Suite 102-314 Gainesville, FL 32606.
3) Call (1-888-372-4774) or email us (cmnewman@pandionsystems.com or cdenny@pandionsystems.com) and we will email you copy of the survey in Microsoft Word.
You can type in the answers to the questions and send them electronically back to us or you can print out the survey(s), fill them out by hand, and send them via fax or mail to us.
Completing the survey on-line is the simplest but if one of three methods does not work for you then please contact us.
Please complete an Individual Program survey for each of your programs by January 15, 2003.
For this project the following definitions apply: A program is a class, course, workshop, seminar, set of materials, curriculum, field trip, presentation, etc. where learning is the primary objective for the participants (students or educators).
A brochure, interpretive sign, or exhibit is not a program but could be part of a program.
84
A K-12 program is a program that is specifically developed for K-12 age students (public/private school, home school).
It does not include programs developed for general audiences where K-12 students are not the primary target group or programs for youth who are not attending as a part of a school related program (e.g. boy or girl scout program).
For example an interpretive walk designed for third grade classes is K-12 program but an interpretive walk led for general visitors on weekends is not a K-12 program.
If your Reserve has a learning center, the learning center and its exhibits are not a K-12 program but a program may utilize the learning center as one of its components.
A professional teacher development (PTD) program is a program that is specifically developed for teachers that work with K-12 students.
Participants include public, private, and home-school educators.
A current program is a program that was run in the past 12 months or will be run in the next 12 months.
If you have any questions or concerns about the survey or about whether you should include an activity that you do at your Reserve as K-12 or PTD program, then please contact Christian Newman (cmnewman@pandionsystems.com) or Christine Denny (cdenny@pandionsystems.com) at (888) 372-4774.
