CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 1 Civil Air Patrol Cadet Orientation Course Section A Introduction This Orientation Course may be the most important class a Civil Air Patrol (CAP) cadet will attend because it sets the stage for the cadet' entire Civil Air Patrol career.
It is critical that the instructor at s the unit level presents a quality orientation course to ensure new members begin their CAP career successfully.
This videotape-based orientation course should last from 4 to 6 hours and is intended to provide new members with the basics of Civil Air Patrol.
You may choose to either deliver the course in five parts over a 5-week period, or complete the course over a weekend day.
The individual instructor should use the videotape in conjunction with this instructor guide and locally developed information to present a carefully planned orientation course.
The tape is not intended as a stand alone product to be given to a new cadet for self-study at home.
The tape, along with this instructor guide, should be the basis for questions and discussion which will help show new members how they fit into the important mission of CAP.
Orientation Course Text The primary texts for the Orientation Course are CAPM 50-16, Introduction to Civil Air Patrol, and CAPM 50-1.
Cadets should receive a copy of CAPM 50-16 in their initial training packet and should be encouraged to purchase CAPM 50-1 as a reference to the material presented in this course.
Instructors may order the number of copies required in advance for a fee from the CAP Bookstore by phoning 1800-633-8768 or FAX orders to 1-334-265-6381.
Instructor Guide This instructor guide was developed to help the instructor conduct a successful orientation course beginning with a checklist for planning the course.
By following the checklist, instructors should be able to avoid the painful experience of arriving at the scheduled day for the course without such critical elements as equipment, course materials, or a place to conduct the training.
The checklist provides reminders of duplication requirements for lesson materials.
The course outline gives you timing and flow guidelines for the course.
The instructor guide includes a teaching plan for the overview and each of the five parts of the orientation course.
Following is a brief explanation of the headings and notes used in the instructor guide.
References: These are the manuals and pamphlets that are the basis for the teaching plan.
If possible, instructors should review this material prior to teaching the course.

Show Slide: CAP Cadet Orientation Course Cadet Orientation Course ATTENTION: Welcome to the Cadet Orientation Course for Welcome new members.
We are going to spend the next several hours/weeks together learning about an organization I' very proud to belong to: m Civil Air Patrol.
Your experience in CAP can be one of the most exciting and rewarding things you do in your lifetime.
You can learn a multitude of new things, receive top-notch training, build life-long friendships, contribute to your community and your nation, and even participate in disaster relief and life saving operations in times of emergency.
Besides all those worthy accomplishments, CAP membership is one of the most fun organizations you can be a part of if you are prepared to take advantage of all the opportunities available to you.
MOTIVATION: This course has been designed to provide you, as a new CAP cadet, with the information you' need to take advantage of the many opportunities in Civil Air Patrol.
This course is ll designed to give you the basic knowledge necessary to be informed and effective members of CAP.
Completion of this course will also prepare you for taking part in the Cadet Program.

The five parts of ll the course each include a video segment followed by a class discussion and review of the material.
To get the most from the course, I encourage you to watch the videotape segments carefully and make notes to yourself.
Then, during the classroom lesson, everyone should participate actively during the discussion.
This will help you review what you' learned once you receive your new books.

We want to make sure that you have the CAP career successfully after you complete this course.
We' ll give us feedback on how we can improve it as you have the critique.
Transition: You can see that we do have a great deal of material to cover, but before we begin, it is important to take a few minutes to get to know each other.
State: We' take a few minutes to go around the room and learn a little about the other people in this ll classroom.
The people you see around you will be learning different jobs and have different roles to play in CAP, but each one has a valuable contribution to make.
It helps to learn a little bit about the people you' be working with to accomplish the CAP mission in this unit.
We don' need your entire ll t life story, just your name, where you go to school, a couple of things that really interest you, and how long you' been in CAP.
I' start the process in a few minutes, but first I want you to write down the ve ll answer to this question.
Question: Why did you join Civil Air Patrol? Instructor Note: Pass out 3x5 cards for students to record their answers.
Tell them not to write their name on the card, just the answers.
After a couple of minutes, take up the cards and begin the introductions by telling the students a little bit about yourself.
It may help to list the items on the board that you want students to cover to avoid lengthy introductions by some individuals.
Instructor Note: When you have a chance later during the playing of the video segments, look over these cards and categorize them to fit your lesson plan.
Find a point in your lesson plan that corresponds to a reason a student gave for joining CAP.
For example, if someone listed "To learn to fly airplanes," you can highlight this during the discussion of Part II, Missions of CAP, or Part V, the Cadet Program.
Remember, these students joined CAP because they wish to contribute to an organization they believe in or because they wish to gain something of value by belonging.
Either way, the more you make the orientation course relevant to each student, the more success you' have as an instructor.
ll Show them that the orientation course is meeting a real need, and you' gain their interest and ll involvement during the next few hours you spend together.
10 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Transition to Part I: Now that we know a little bit about each other, and I have some ideas about why you joined CAP, let' get on with business.
s This first video segment will tell you about the proud history of CAP.
Watch the video, make notes, and we' discuss the history of CAP after you' ll ve seen the video.

ATTENTION: Did you know before watching the video that Civil Air Patrol was older than the US Air Force and played a vital role in defense of the United States during World War II including missions to bomb submarines? This video points out how and why Civil Air Patrol got its start before the US became officially involved in WW II and how CAP evolved into the auxiliary of the US Air Force.
MOTIVATION: To be an effective member of any organization, you need to know something about how and why the organization began and some of the people who made the organization what it is.
For example, if you play outfield for the Yankees you ought to know about a guy named Babe Ruth, or if you build cars for Ford Motor Company, you should know about Henry and even Edsel.
The goal of this lesson is for members to learn about the history and evolution of Civil Air Patrol into the organization it is today and some of the people who made that happen.
In addition, you' learn about ll the people and significant events that have molded this local unit.

Founders and Supporters of Civil Air Patrol State: I hope you all have read about the beginning of Civil Air Patrol in CAPM 50-1.
CAPM 50-1 gives you a good account of the concerns that private aviation supporters had about the loss of control of civil aviation and some of the Americans who acted on those concerns.
Question: What were the primary concerns of private aviation supporters in the US during the 1930s prior to America' involvement in WW II? s Answer: 1.
That the nation' air power had to be strengthened.
s 2.
Civil flights in the US might be eliminated if the US became involved in the war.
CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 13 FUQ: Who was the "founder" of Civil Air Patrol? Answer: Gill Robb Wilson Transition: As you saw in the video, Gill Robb Wilson provided the initial push for CAP, but there were other early supporters that helped CAP become a reality.
Show Slide: Founders and Supporters Founders and Supporters Gill Robb Wilson General H.H. (Hap) Arnold Thomas Beck Guy Gannet Fiorello LaGuardia Major General John F. Curry FUQ: Who was the Chief of the Army Air Corps from 1938-41 and how did he support Gill Robb Wilson and Civil Air Patrol? Answer: General H.H. (Hap) Arnold backed Wilson' early plans for Civil Air Defense Services, and later setup s a board of military officers to review the final plan presented by Wilson.
The board, headed by General George Stratemeyer, approved the plan and recommended that Army Air Forces (AAF) officers help setup and administer the CAP organization.
FUQ: What state' plan for civil air defense services became the blueprint for the formation of Civil s Air Patrol? Answer: Gill Robb Wilson' New Jersey Civil Air Defense Services plan became the blueprint for Civil Air s Patrol.
Wilson' plan called for a civilian pilot instructor refresher course and a civil pilot training s program.
A second step of the plan called for organization of civil aviation personnel to be used in the coming war effort.
FUQ: Who were some of the early supporters of the Civil Air Patrol? Answer: Thomas H. Beck, Guy P. Gannet, who were businessmen and Fiorello H. LaGuardia, the director of the newly formed Office of Civilian Defense.
LaGuardia appointed Wilson, Beck, and Gannet to a special aviation committee that worked to finalize the details of the plan.
With the approval of the AAF board, LaGuardia signed a formal order creating the Civil Air Patrol on 1 December 1941.
FUQ: Who became the first commander of Civil Air Patrol on 8 December 1941? Who was the first executive officer? Answer: Major General John F. Curry, US Army Air Forces was the first commander and Gill Robb Wilson was the first Executive Officer.
14 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Transition to MP 3: CAP was born during the tumultuous first week of December 1941 when Pearl Harbor became etched on every American' mind.
As an organization, CAP had to hit the ground s running as the US entered the war.

Civil Air Patrol During World War II MP4.
The History of the Cadet Program Question: After the US entered WW II, what German threat brought Civil Air Patrol forces into action? Answer: German submarines operating off the eastern and southeastern coasts were taking a heavy toll in American shipping of war supplies and materials.
FUQ: What event brought about the arming of Civil Air Patrol aircraft? Answer: The escape of a grounded German submarine in May 1942 which had been a "sitting duck" for a CAP aircraft which was unarmed.
FUQ: Who was credited with the first CAP "kill" of a German submarine? Answer: A crew of Captain Johnny Haggins and Major Wynant Farr, flying a Grumman Widgeon out of Atlantic City, depth-charged and destroyed a German submarine off the coast of New Jersey.
FUQ: How many submarines did CAP sink during WW II? Answer: CAP sank two submarines.
FUQ: Besides coastal patrol, what other missions did CAP have during WW II? Show Slide: Other WW II Missions Other WW II Missions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Search and Rescue (SAR) Cargo and Courier Border Patrol Aerial Target Towing Searchlight and Radar Training Disaster Relief Airfield and Resource Security Pilot Training Activities Answer: During the period January 1942 to January 1946, CAP pilots flew over 24,000 hours of assigned search and rescue (SAR) missions plus many thousands of additional SAR hours at their own expense.
In Nevada, CAP SAR teams formed their own cavalry to rescue crews in rough terrain, and in Florida SAR teams used swamp or glade buggies to rescue crews.
Flying cargo and courier missions, CAP pilots flew over 3.5 million pounds of mail and cargo plus hundreds of military passengers.
CAP aircraft flew over 30,000 hours of border patrol missions along the Mexican border to spot suspicious activities.
CAP pilots also towed aerial targets and supported searchlight and radar training missions.
CAP pilots aided in disaster relief and ground personnel guarded airfields and other vital resources.
Throughout the war, CAP carried on pilot training activities to prepare pilots for military service and for the Civil Air Patrol.
CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 15 FUQ: What is the significance of the date 29 April 1943 to Civil Air Patrol? Answer: Because of its successful accomplishment of all these wartime missions, CAP was transferred on this date from the Office of Civilian Defense to the War Department where it continued to train Army aviation cadets in great numbers until the end of the war racking up a total of 500,000 hours of missions.
FUQ: Why was the Cadet Program started? Answer: The Cadet Program was started to train and motivate young people for future service to CAP and to join the Army Air Forces during WW II.
The training they received in CAP made them more prepared when they entered the military.
FUQ: When was the Cadet Program started? Answer: October 1, 1942 Transition to MP 4: (Classroom added material) I' like to mention now a little about the history of d the Cadet Program.
CAP did not have young men and women like yourselves in the beginning; only adults could belong and perform the missions.
But several things happened which led to the development of the cadet program.
Many adults were leaving CAP because they were being drafted into military service.
Since CAP wasn' t part of the military (remember, we were volunteers even then), they had to leave.
Instructor Note: Define the draft.
As a result, CAP had to find more members to perform their missions.
At the same time, planners found that many jobs could be performed by young people.
It only made sense to open membership to them, to train them to be full fledged members when they were old enough to become senior members.
The Army Air Forces (AAF) became interested in this idea, because they saw that the "cadets" as they would be called, would be better prepared to deal with the rigors of military life if they were called to enter service.
CAP service would also provide some of the technical training they would need when they entered the military.
Finally, during WW II, everyone was looking for a way to contribute to the war effort.
Young people from all over America wanted to help out.
So, CAP service was attractive to them.
The AAF and the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) supported CAP' plan and the CAP Cadet Program s was started on 1 October 1942, in Minnesota.
The first Director of the Cadet Program was Captain Kendall K. Hoyt, AAF.
The program was so successful that when CAP received its Congressional Charter and status as the Air Force Auxiliary, it became a primary mission: co-equal with Emergency Services and Aerospace Education.
It has evolved and grown into the program you are now in today.
16 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Transition to MP 5: During the last 2 years of the war, CAP continued to accomplish vital missions until the Japanese surrender in September 1945.
A period of massive demobilization began.
MP 5.
Civil Air Patrol During the Post-war Period Question: How would you characterize the future of CAP at the end of WW II? Answer: Despite proving itself with many wartime missions, CAP' future was uncertain after the war.
The s drastic cut in post-war budgets threatened a cut-off in AAF funding which led General Arnold to convene a conference of CAP wing commanders to develop a plan for the future of Civil Air Patrol.
Show Slide: Public Law 476 Public Law 476 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage development of aviation Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage contributions to public welfare Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide aviation education and training Ã¯Â¿Â½ Foster civil aviation Ã¯Â¿Â½ Private citizens assist in emergencies FUQ: What were the results of the conference convened by General Arnold? Answer: The conference recommendations led to the incorporation of CAP as a Corporation "solely of a benevolent character" on 1 July 1946, under Public Law 476.
The law called on CAP to: a.
Provide an organization to encourage and aid American citizens in the contribution of their efforts, services, and resources in the development of aviation and in the maintenance of air supremacy, and to encourage and develop by example the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.
b. Provide aviation education and training especially to its senior and cadet members; to encourage and foster civil aviation in local communities and to provide an organization of private citizens with adequate facilities to assist in meeting local and national emergencies.
Instructor Note: Paraphrase the above paragraphs according to the age of the audience.
Transition: Show Slide: Let' look at the objectives CAP adopted to accomplish these missions.

Civil Air Patrol: The USAF Auxiliary Show Slide: CAP: The USAF Auxiliary CAP: The USAF Auxiliary National Security Act 1947 establishes USAF Public Law 557 in May 1948 established CAP as the USAF Auxiliary Question: What event in 1947 caused the CAP to review its relationship with the Army Air Forces? Answer: The National Security Act of 1947 removed the Army Air Forces from Army control and established the US Air Force as a separate service.
FUQ: What was the relationship between CAP and the new US Air Force? Answer: In October 1947, a CAP board met with USAF officials to permanently establish CAP as the USAF Auxiliary.
On 26 May 1948, Congress approved Public Law 557 making CAP an official auxiliary of the new US Air Force.
Interim Summary: We have looked at the evolution of CAP from its beginning on the eve of WW II up until it became a permanent auxiliary of the USAF.
Since that time, there have been many others who have made lasting contributions to CAP.
As a new CAP member it is important that you know about the proud heritage associated with the uniform you wear.
Over the years, CAP members have sacrificed their lives and their worldly goods to support a mission and organization they believed in.
Members of this unit have also sacrificed and contributed to the proud traditions of Civil Air Patrol.

20 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 TEACHING PLAN Instructor Note: Use PowerPoint Slides # 3, CAP Missions 
ATTENTION: Before watching the video, did you know Civil Air Patrol was involved in this many missions? Did you understand the organizational structure of CAP? The video did a good job of showing you some of the activities of Civil Air Patrol, and now we want to look at the missions and organization of CAP in detail - especially how the cadet program works with CAP' other primary s missions - and answer any questions you may have.
MOTIVATION: Have you gone to your first day of school and left your class schedule in your homeroom or at home? How difficult was it to know where you were supposed to be and when you had to be there? The class schedule was your road map to navigating around the school to get to your destination: your classes.
Similarly, as you began your career in CAP, it helps to have a road map so you know where the organization is headed, how it operates, and what needs to be done.
That is the purpose of the video you just watched and this lesson.

Cadet roles in aerospace education and emergency services Transition to MP 1: If you' remember from the history lesson, CAP was chartered after the war ll under Public Law 476 to perform certain missions "solely of a benevolent character."
MP 1.
Civil Air Patrol Vision and Mission Question: What does "solely of a benevolent character" mean and how would that charter have affected the mission of CAP during WW II? Answer: Benevolence is defined as a tendency to do kind or charitable acts.
Under that charter, CAP would not have been able to participate in armed reconnaissance missions against German submarines.
Thus, CAP' mission changed after the war. s CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 21 State: Today, Civil Air Patrol is still fulfilling the basic missions assigned to it by Congress in 1946, along with responding to new missions which are especially suited to Civil Air Patrol.
First, we' look ll at the big picture: The Vision and Mission Statement of Civil Air Patrol.
Question: Why does an organization need a vision and mission statement? Answer: A organization the future.
members of organization vision and mission statement states clearly what the is all about and where the organization is headed in Mission and vision statements communicate to all the organization the leadership philosophyof the and what its priorities should be.
CAP Vision Statement Civil Air Patrol, America' Air Force s Auxiliary, building the nation' finest s force of citizen volunteers... performing Missions for America.
Show Slide: CAP Vision Statement State: A vision statement declares what an organization wishes to accomplish.
In the case of CAP it is to build the finest force of volunteers to accomplish essential missions for America.
Every member of an organization should know what the organization seeks to accomplish.
Show Slide: CAP Mission Statement CAP Mission Statement To serve America by developing our Nation' youth; accomplishing local, s state and national missions; and educating our citizens to ensure air and space supremacy State: Take note of the three-part missions in the current CAP mission statement.
Do you recognize that these are the three same major missions CAP began with after WW II? Transition to MP 2: Now let' look at each of the three s main missions of CAP and then the other missions that CAP performs.
MP 2.
Missions of Civil Air Patrol Missions of Civil Air Patrol Show Slide: Missions of Civil Air Patrol State: You should recognize that CAP still accomplishes the same three main missions it was assigned in 1946.
The first mission we' look at is aerospace education (AE). ll Show Slide: Aerospace Education Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½
CAP units perform special missions in support of the US Air Force including aerial surveys and monitoring, and transport and communications support missions.
CAP units sharpen their skills by participating in joint exercises with Air Force units.
FUQ: What are the two parts of the aerospace education program? Answer: The two parts of the AE program are internal and external programs.
FUQ: What does the internal aerospace education program do? Aerospace Education Ã¯Â¿Â½ Internal Programs Ã¯Â¿Â½ External Programs 22 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Answer:
The internal AE program educates CAP senior members and cadets about the aerospace environment.
Show Slide: Cadet Programs FUQ: What is the purpose of the CAP cadet program? Answer:
CAP cadet programs offer young people enrolled in the sixth grade and beyond (cadets may continue in the program through age 20) an opportunity to develop their leadership skills through their interest in aviation.
Cadets progress at their own pace through a 15-step program including aerospace education, leadership training, physical fitness, and moral leadership.
FUQ: What are the four parts of the cadet program? Answer: The four parts of the cadet program are: aerospace education, leadership, physical fitness, and moral leadership.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cadet Programs Aerospace Education Leadership Training Physical Fitness Moral Leadership FUQ: What are the other benefits of membership in the cadet program? Answer: Cadets are able to participate in such activities as summer encampments, orientation flights, and national and international activities.
They are also eligible for scholarships for flight training and aerospace related college studies as well as advancement to E-3 (Airman First Class) should they receive CAP' Mitchell Award and enlist in the Air Force.
s Emergency Services Show Slide: Emergency Services Question: What role does CAP play in search and rescue missions? Answer:
CAP air and ground teams perform 85 percent of inland search and rescue missions for the Air Force.
Because CAP members donate their time and efforts, they save taxpayers millions of dollars each year.
During a typical year, more than 100 lives are saved by CAP members.
FUQ: How does CAP support disaster relief efforts and humanitarian services? Answer:
During disasters and other times of need, CAP provides air and ground transportation to relief officials, and supports such agencies as the American Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Aviation Administration, and the Coast Guard.
CAP also employs its Emergency Communications Network to replace or supplement the loss of civil communications systems.

s The corporate headquarters runs the day-to-day business of CAP at the direction of the National Commander and National Board.
State: In addition to the staff of paid corporate employees at CAP National Headquarters, each wing also has a liaison officer and/or NCO who are retired USAF members.
CAP regions have a small staff of volunteers headed by a commander who is appointed by the National Commander and other members who perform education, training, logistics, administrative, and operations functions.

CAP-USAF is co-located with the corporate offices at Maxwell AFB. CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 25 State: The Commander, CAP-USAF, is the commander for all active duty and DoD civilian employees assigned to CAP-USAF.
His position ties the CAP Corporation to the USAF by providing liaison, oversight, and advice to HQ CAP.
Included under CAP-USAF are CAP-USAF Offices (cont' d) the region liaison offices that include a commander and small support staff.

Ã¯Â¿Â½ Public Affairs Transition: Now that we have looked at the Headquarters Ã¯Â¿Â½ Safety Ã¯Â¿Â½ Operations structure, let' see how CAP is structured down to the local level.
s Show Slide: CAP Field Organization or PowerPoint Map of Regions State: First are the eight CAP regions each headed by a CAP colonel.
These regions are made up of five to nine states.
The eight regions are broken down into 52 wings, one for each state plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
Wing commanders are appointed by the region commander and also hold the rank of CAP colonel.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ CAP Field Organization 8 Regions 52 Wings Groups Squadrons Flights State: Groups are established by wing commanders if a need for them is determined.
This need might be based on a large geographic area or number of units.
Show Slide: CAP Squadrons CAP Squadrons Ã¯Â¿Â½ Composite Squadron State: Please turn to the organizational charts in your book.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cadet Squadron Squadrons are the very heart of CAP.
At this level, plans, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Senior Squadron programs, and missions are carried out.
Squadrons furnish the resources and people to assist their communities in times of need or disaster.
They also recruit and train new members.
State: Composite squadrons include both senior and cadet training programs.
Cadet squadrons include seniors and cadets, but only have cadet training programs.
Senior squadrons are made up of only senior members.
State: Flights are formed under a sponsoring squadron if a need exists.
For example, there may be insufficient members in a sparsely populated area to form a squadron.
Transition to MP 4: Now that you see how CAP is organized, let' see where your unit fits into the s structure.
MP 4.
Where the Local Unit and/or Wing Fits Within Civil Air Patrol 26 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Instructor Note: Here you might display an organizational chart for your unit or draw a diagram of the squadron, group, wing, and region your unit belongs to.
Highlight the primary missions of your unit.
Also show the similarities between the cadet and senior chains of command within your unit.
Show Slide: CAP Chain of Command CAP Chain of Command CAP Headquarters Your Region Region Commander Your Wing Wing Commander Your Group Group Commander Your Squadron Squadron Commander Your Flight State: Here is how this unit fits in the chain of command.
As your experience with CAP grows, you' learn how the levels function ll together to accomplish the CAP mission.
Instructor Note: At this point, have the cadets write in their notes the name of the National Commander, and the names of the region, wing, group, and squadron commanders in their chain of command.
Transition to MP 5: Finally, let' take a look at how the cadet program contributes to CAP' two other s s primary missions: aerospace education and emergency services.
MP 5.
Cadet Roles in Emergency Services and Aerospace Education State: As you know, you are the cadet program, and thus have a very important place within CAP.
Did you know that cadets play an active role in the two other primary missions of CAP? In fact, CAP can' t fully perform its aerospace education and emergency services missions without cadets! State: The cadet program has aerospace education as one of its component parts.
CAP feels that you would not know as much as you should about the organization, the Air Force, and society at large if you did not have an appreciation of the aerospace environment.
State: To aerospace, education consumer, a cadet, aerospace education means learning about air and space, weather, careers in and airplanes and rockets, not just what they look like, but what makes them fly.
Aerospace also means what the impact of the aerospace environment has on you--as a person, as a and as a CAP member.
Cadet Program and Aerospace Education Cadet Program and Aerospace Education Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Orientation Flights Model Airplane Building Model Rocketry Flight Training Orientation about Aerospace Careers Show Slide: State: The CAP has much to offer its cadets in aerospace education: orientation flights, model airplane and rocketry building, flight training, and introductions to aerospace careers, just to name a few things.
These activities show cadets just like you the importance of aerospace in today' world.
s CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 27 FUQ: What are some aerospace activities that cadets can participate in? Answer: Flight of Discovery self-study program (a requirement for completing cadet achievements) Model rocketry Orientation flights Model aircraft building Flight training Show Slide: Cadet Program and Emergency Services Cadet Program and Emergency Services Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ground Team Administrative Support Communications Support Flight Line Activities Mission Flight Crew State: And, if you thought the emergency services part of the video looked interesting, then you' be happy to know that you are among ll CAP' emergency services most needed resources.
The men and s women who lead emergency services missions depend upon you to help them carry out those missions and sometimes save lives! In fact, the only activity you can' participate in is counterdrug t operations--for legal reasons.
State: You can train to be part of a ground team - actively searching for missing airplanes and people and maybe eventually leading the searches.
You can perform administrative support and communications at the mission base.
Or, you can marshal aircraft on the flight line.
You may even qualify to be part of a mission flight crew on Air Force reimbursable missions once you reach the age of 18!

Closure: During the first two parts of this course, we have looked at the history of CAP and the CAP missions and organizations.
Having an awareness of these elements helps you to see the big picture and how you fit into it.
Transition to Part III: During the next two parts of the course, we' be looking at things you need to ll know to be able to participate in CAP activities: uniforms and grooming standards and customs and courtesies of CAP.
Unless there are other questions, let' look at Part III of the video now and find out s all about maintaining a proper image in a CAP uniform.
28 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Optional Transition to Part III: Next week, we' begin to look at things you' need to know to ll ll participate in CAP activities: CAP uniform wear and grooming standards.
We' discuss the importance ll of maintaining a proper image in a CAP uniform.
Any questions? CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 29 PERIOD TITLE: Part III, Civil Air Patrol Uniforms REFERENCES: CAP Visual Aid 39-1, Civil Air Patrol Grooming Standards; CAPM 39-1, Civil Air Patrol Uniform Manual; CAPR 39-3, Award of Civil Air Patrol Medals, Ribbons, and Certificates; CAPP 151, Standards, Customs, and Courtesies; and the Civil Air Patrol Bookstore Catalog.
GOAL: The goal of this lesson is for each participant to know the proper wear and maintenance of Civil Air Patrol uniforms and insignia.
Participants will learn proper grooming standards and responsibilities for correcting deviations from standards.
In addition, members will learn uniform requirements for the local unit and/or wing.
LESSON OBJECTIVES: Each participant should be able to: 1.
Explain why proper grooming and uniform wear are important to CAP. 2.
Identify various uniform combinations permitted within Civil Air Patrol.
3.
Give examples of when and when not to wear various Civil Air Patrol uniforms.
4.
Demonstrate the proper wear of Civil Air Patrol decorations and insignia.

POINTS: Importance of Grooming and Uniform Standards Civil Air Patrol Uniform Combinations When and Where to Wear Civil Air Patrol Uniforms Civil Air Patrol Decorations, Ribbons, and Badges Local Uniform Requirements PLAN OF PRESENTATION: The instructor should introduce Part III of the Level I Orientation Video and then have members view the segment.
After stopping the tape at the end of Part III, the instructor should facilitate the lesson using the teaching plan on uniform and grooming standards.
Instructors should add information that applies to the local unit and/or wing.
30 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 TEACHING PLAN Instructor Note: Use PowerPoint Slides #4, CAP Uniform Slides, or other visual aids.
ATTENTION: The video you just watched was intended to give you a brief look at the history of the uniform and some instruction on the proper wear of the CAP uniform.
But, think for a minute about what a uniform does.
It not only identifies you as a member of a business or organization, it makes a statement about how you feel about that organization.
For example, if a pizza delivery person shows up at your door with a dirty uniform and generally looks unkempt, you make some negative assumptions about the quality of the food he' just brought to you.
This initial judgment may or may not be right, s but the fact is, you made negative assumptions instead of the positive assumptions you might have made if the uniform and person both looked sharp when you first opened the door.
MOTIVATION: When you wear the uniform as a member of Civil Air Patrol, people also make assumptions about you and your CAP unit.
Again, the assumptions may be right or wrong, but they are based in a large part on the image you present in your uniform.
This lesson is intended to give you the guidance you need to wear the uniform properly and to meet acceptable grooming standards.
If you are going to wear the CAP uniform as a cadet, you have an obligation to your unit, to yourself, to your fellow CAP cadets, and to the public to wear it proudly and properly.
OVERVIEW: State: CAP members wear a uniform similar to the US Air Force with distinctive emblems, insignia, and badges to identify the wearer as a member of CAP.
We couldn' possibly cover all the uniform t requirements and grooming standards in the time we have allowed, so we will highlight some of the more important details of the uniform manual, CAPM 39-1.

Importance Standards Show Slide: of Grooming and Uniform Grooming and Uniform Standards Ã¯Â¿Â½ CAP Grooming Standards -- Air Force Military-style uniform --- Must meet CAP weight standards --- Must meet AF grooming standards Grooming 
CAP Grooming Standards State: When in the Air Force military-style uniform, Ã¯Â¿Â½ CAP Uniform Standards members must follow some very strict weight and grooming guidelines.
Attachment 2 of CAPM 39-1 gives the weight standards for CAP members to wear the Air Force-style uniform.
Cadets under the age of 18 may exceed the CAP weight standards and wear the Air Force-style uniform.
Cadets ages 18 and above who exceed the CAP weight standards must choose an alternate uniform.
Members who do not meet standards for wear of the military-style uniform for reasons of grooming or fitness may participate in unit activities, but must not wear the military-style uniform while participating.
Members may wear the CAP blazer, or other authorized uniform combinations detailed in CAPM 39-1.
State: Attachment 1 of CAPM 39-1 shows the specific grooming guidelines for hair, sideburns, and mustaches.
Male cadets' haircuts must have a tapered appearance.
Hair must not touch the back of the ears or the collar.
Sideburns should be neatly trimmed, not flared.
They should end with a clean-shaven horizontal line.
They must not extend beyond the lowest part of the exterior ear.
Bangs should not extend below the eyebrows and should not be exposed when headgear is worn.
Mustaches must be neatly trimmed.
They may not extend downward beyond the lip line of the upper lip or extend sideways beyond a vertical line drawn upward from the corner of the mouth.
Beards and goatees are forbidden in the Air Force military-style uniform.
Instructor Note: You may want to select members of your squadron who meet grooming standards and use them to demonstrate hair or mustache requirements or refer them to Attachment 1 of CAPM 39-1.
State: Women' hair should be neatly arranged and shaped to present a conservative feminine s appearance.
Hairstyles that prevent the proper wearing of the flight cap or service hat are not appropriate.
Barrettes, ribbons, and other ornaments, except inconspicuous pins and combs, will not be worn in the hair when in uniform.
The hair in back may touch, but not fall below the bottom edge of the collar.
Transition to Uniform Standards: The rule to follow is: AF grooming standards apply anytime you wear the military-style uniform.
Now let' look at uniform standards which apply to all the uniforms s you wear. b. CAP Uniform Standards State: When uniforms are worn, they must be clean, neat, correct in design and specification, properly fitted, and in good condition.
Uniforms should be kept zippered, snapped, or buttoned.
Shoes should be shined and in good repair.
Metallic insignia, badges, and other devices, including blue service uniform buttons, must also be maintained in the proper luster and condition.
32 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Men: For men, articles such as wallets, pencils, pens, watch chains, fobs, pins, jewelry, handkerchiefs, combs, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, and sunglasses cases should not be worn exposed on the uniform.
The wear of watches and rings is permitted.
The wear of an identification bracelet is permitted if it is neat and conservative.
Conservative sunglasses may be worn with all uniforms except in military formation.
Ribbons, when worn, must be clean and not frayed.
Wear of earrings, ornamentation on eyeglass lenses, or visible ornamentations around the neck are prohibited while in uniform.
Women: Women must keep skirt lengths within the dictates of fashion and good taste, but with due regard to the dignity of the uniform.
In any case, skirt lengths will be no higher than above the top of the kneecap or lower than the bottom of the kneecap.
Skirts will hang freely and under no circumstances be excessively tight.
Pencils, pens, pins, handkerchiefs, and jewelry will not be worn or carried exposed on the uniform.
Small, round, conservative earrings of gold, white pearl, or silver may be worn with all dress and service uniforms.
Conservative, round diamond earrings may be worn with the mess dress uniform.
Also, small, plain, healing posts may be worn during the healing period.
Only one earring or healing post may be worn on or in each earlobe.
Other visible ornaments around the neck or on the head, ornamentation on eyeglass lenses, and ankle bracelets are prohibited.
Wristwatches, identification bracelets, and rings are permitted.
Conservative sunglasses may be worn, except in military formation.
Appropriate undergarments must be worn to present a conservative feminine appearance.
Religious apparel: While in uniform, members may wear certain visible items of religious apparel.
CAPM 39-1 defines religious apparel as "articles of clothing or dress which are part of the doctrine of traditional observance of the religious faith practiced by the member."
Hair and grooming practices are not included in the meaning of religious apparel.
Jewelry of a religious nature must conform to standards set forth in this regulation for wear of non-religious jewelry.
Religious head coverings are authorized only when military headgear is not authorized.
Head coverings must be plain dark blue or black without adornment.
Also, they may be worn underneath military headgear if they do not interfere with the proper fit or appearance of the headgear.
For example, Jewish yarmulkes meet this requirement when they do not exceed 6 inches in diameter.
Transition to MP 2: Now that we have covered some of the general rules about grooming standards and wearing uniforms, let' look at some of the uniform combinations that CAP members may wear.
s Show Slide: CAP Uniform Combinations CAP Uniform Combinations Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ CAP Blazer Combination Blue Shirt Combination Service Dress AF Flight Suit CAP Jump Suit BDUs MP 2.
Civil Air Patrol Uniform Combinations State: There are certain times when cadets like yourselves will be required to wear the uniform such as during squadron or wing activities or when specified by your commander.
However, your commanders should be aware that you and your family will purchase and maintain your uniforms and must attempt to keep the personal expense for your uniforms to the minimum.
The first uniform combination we' look at can be worn by all CAP members.
ll Instructor Note: Have the students turn to their uniform handout and follow along where appropriate.
CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 33 a.
The CAP Blazer Combination may be worn during any season of the year.
Members may wear this uniform in lieu of the service uniform, at CAP social occasions and on certain non-CAP occasions.
Cadets who wear this uniform may not remove the blazer and may not wear cadet grade.
(Not shown in hand out.
Refer to the video.)
b.
The Blue Shirt Combination is the same uniform worn by active duty military personnel, and is the basic CAP cadet uniform.
Cadets may wear this uniform when engaged in normal duties as a CAP member and/or while attending local, area, or national CAP functions.
Members may wear the uniform when traveling by commercial means to official CAP functions.
They may also wear the uniform on military aircraft, although they are encouraged to wear the CAP jump suit, blazer combination, or civilian clothes.
While wearing this uniform, cadets over the age of 18 must adhere to the accepted weight and grooming standards of the Air-Force-style uniform.
c.
The Service Dress should be worn for ceremonies, parades, reviews, official visits, change of command, or when prescribed by appropriate authority.
This is an Air Force-style uniform, so the appropriate guidelines for weight and grooming must be followed.
Details on the accessories for this uniform are in CAPM 39-1, Chapter 2.
d.
The AF Flight Suit is another uniform option.
The wing commander, or the commander to whom such authority is delegated by the wing commander, will prescribe the type of clothing to be worn while flying or engaging in organized recreational activities.
Cadets may wear the flight suit without grade insignia. e.
The CAP Jump Suit is an optional uniform that may be worn for flying activities or as an utility uniform.
The jump suit may be authorized by the local commander for wear at special activities such as drills, parades, tours, fund-raising activities, and other events.
Cadets over the age of 18 not meeting the grooming and fitness standards for the Air Force-style uniform may wear the jump suit with grade insignia. f. CAP members may also wear the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU).
The BDUs are considered a work utility uniform.
They may be worn while performing duties at the squadron, special activity, or mission site (actual or practice missions).
Members should not wear the uniform to off-base business establishments to do extended shopping, dining, socializing, or to take part in any entertainment.
The BDUs are considered an Air Force-style uniform.
However, cadets over the age of 18 who do not meet proper weight and grooming standards may wear this uniform without grade insignia.
State: Again, specific accessories for each of these uniforms are outlined in CAPM 39-1.
Instructor Note: Time does not allow for a detailed discussion of all the uniform combinations and the accessories that go with them.
The intent of this section is to make students aware of the various uniforms available and where they can find out particulars for wearing the various uniform combinations (CAPM 39-1).
Use the following questions or others to recap briefly.
34 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Interim Summary: FUQ: When is it appropriate to wear the service dress uniform? Answer: For ceremonies, parades, reviews, official visits, change of command, or when prescribed by appropriate authority.
Instructor Note: Time permitting, you may ask other questions to ensure students understand the material.
State: CAP members belong to the official auxiliary of the United States Air Force.
Therefore, you can enjoy the pride and privilege of wearing the uniform.
You represent yourself, CAP, and your country when you wear the uniform, so you should invest the time and energy to always wear the uniform properly.
Transition to MP 3: So far we' looked at uniform and grooming standards and the uniform ve combinations CAP members may wear.
Knowing how to wear the uniform and what uniforms to wear are important, but you also need to know when and when not to wear your uniform.
MP 3.
When and Where to Wear CAP Uniforms Show Slide: Wearing the Uniform Wearing the Uniform Wear Ã¯Â¿Â½ Normal CAP Duties Ã¯Â¿Â½ Military or Commercial Flights Ã¯Â¿Â½ Military Social functions State: The CAP uniform may be worn when engaged in normal duties as a CAP member.
With certain restrictions, uniforms may be worn on commercial or military flights or when visiting military installations.
The service or dress uniform is appropriate for social activities on military installations or when attending functions of a military nature when representing CAP.
State: The CAP uniform should not be worn more than 1 hour after the close of activities or when participating in a public demonstration not approved by the Air Force.
The uniform must not be worn when engaged in private employment or when sponsoring or advertising a commercial interest.
The uniform must not be worn to any meeting or demonstration of a group that advocates illegal acts or violence against the government or other groups.
The CAP uniform will not be worn in foreign countries except when participating in official exchange programs or other international events.

After stopping the tape at the end of Part IV, the instructor should facilitate the lesson using the teaching plan on customs and courtesies.
Instructors should add information that applies to the local unit and/or wing.
38 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 TEACHING PLAN Instructor Note: Use PowerPoint Slides #5, CAP Customs and Courtesies, or other visual aids.
ATTENTION: Have you ever felt out know the rules but you didn' Or, what t? when the people in charge didn' seem t (including the audience) felt embarrassed of place at a social function because everyone else seemed to about some public gathering at school or in your community to know what they were supposed to do next and everyone for them? MOTIVATION: Customs and courtesies provide guidelines for members of an organization to prevent (or at least reduce) the chance of embarrassment and of making members feel uncomfortable.
The intent of customs and courtesies is not to demean or exalt anyone.
The intent is to provide "rules of engagement" so that all members know what is required and what is expected.
Customs and courtesies help all members adjust to the requirements of belonging to an organization.
The proper intent of customs and courtesies is to include new members into the organization--not exclude them.
OVERVIEW: State: The video you just watched demonstrated some of the unique customs and courtesies practiced by military and CAP units.
As I mentioned, your understanding of these time honored customs and courtesies helps you adjust to the requirements for membership in CAP and feel you are part of the unit.

Customs and Courtesies of the Local Unit and Wing Transition to MP 1: One of the unique features of belonging to CAP is the opportunity to progress in a grade structure similar to the US Air Force.
As your time and experience in CAP increase, so does the opportunity to advance in grade to assume higher levels of responsibility in the unit.
Your progress in the organization and CAP is based in a large part on your initiative to complete cadet program training requirements and to serve in leadership positions in the unit.
These initiatives also prepare you for higher responsibilities at the wing or region level.
Let' begin this lesson by making sure everyone s knows the grade structure of CAP. CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 39 MP1.
Grade Structure of CAP Show Slide: Grade Structure of CAP Grade Structure of CAP Ã¯Â¿Â½ Senior Member Insignia Ã¯Â¿Â½ Flight Officers Ã¯Â¿Â½ Senior Member Airman Insignia Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cadet Officer Insignia Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cadet Airman Insignia State: As a new cadet, you may not be familiar with the CAP grade structure.
CAP senior members wear grade insignia very similar to the grade structure of the military.
Senior members wear epaulets that are gray in color and include the designation "CAP."
CAP cadets have their own grade structure and insignia.
Cadets are awarded grade based on their completion of cadet achievements.
Specific requirements for uniforms and grade insignia are shown in CAPM 39-1 and CAPR 35-5.
Instructor Note: You may want to bring in different insignia or show insignia on a chart such as CAPVA 49.
For the cadet grade structure, you may refer to the cadet grade handout in the student guide.

Customs and Courtesies of Civil Air Patrol Customs and Courtesies of CAP Show Slide: Customs and Courtesies of CAP Question: Does anyone wonder why a civilian volunteer organization like CAP would worry about something so military sounding as customs and courtesies? Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Preserve traditions Show mutual respect Uphold the need for order Sense of belonging Answer: CAP uses them to create a sense of unity and mutual respect among its members.
As a member of an auxiliary of the US Air Force, you are expected to follow the traditions, standards, customs and courtesies agreed to and accepted by the Air Force and CAP.
These apply to all of us and reflect our pride and professionalism as members of CAP.
Military customs and courtesies are proven traditions that explain what should and should not be done.
They are acts of respect and courtesy in dealing with other people.
They have evolved as a result of the need for order, as well as the mutual respect and sense of fraternity that exist among military personnel and CAP members.
FUQ: What is a custom? Answer: It is an act or a ceremony stemming from tradition and enforced as an unwritten law.
Many of these customs stem from traditions and have historical significance.
Though enforced as unwritten law, the steps taken in many of our customs have been written down over time to ensure that they are done properly.
40 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 FUQ: What is a courtesy? Answer: It is different from a custom only in that it was written down.
Saluting can be considered a courtesy, there are certain rules about who, where, and when to render the salute, and these are written down.
You may notice that this definition sounds much like a custom, and you would be right.
Though in times past, the differences were more apparent; the line has blurred because the need to uniformity has led to customs being documented.
All you need to remember is that customs and courtesies are things that we do in CAP to show respect to superior officers and our American Flag, and that they stem from tradition.
Transition to MP 3: Another unique aspect of belonging to CAP is participation in the ceremonies and protocol associated with CAP and the US Air Force.
MP 3.
Protocol and Ceremonies Show Slide: Protocol and Ceremonies Protocol and Ceremonies Ã¯Â¿Â½ Protocol Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ceremonies -- Awards -- Promotion -- Retirement -- Change of Command Ã¯Â¿Â½ Funerals Ã¯Â¿Â½ Social Functions -- Receptions -- Dining-In 
In CAP, this code of accepted practices and procedures parallels the US Air Force.
Protocol procedures help to properly recognize dignitaries and recipients of awards, decorations, and promotions, and to provide a more professional atmosphere at these events.
State: We do not have time to discuss all the types of events you may be involved with in CAP. CAPP 151 is your guide to planning and participating in ceremonies and activities that require proper protocol.
As you progress in CAP, you will become familiar with these requirements and learn to see them for what they are; guidelines to help you maintain a professional unit that all members can be proud to belong to.
Transition to MP 4: One way to immediately demonstrate your pride and professionalism is to master the art of saluting.
MP 4.
Saluting and Basic Drill State: Saluting is a time honored tradition associated with the profession of arms.
Different countries and services use different forms of saluting but the intent is the same, to recognize fellow members of the profession of arms.
When CAP members are in uniform, they must know how and when to salute properly.
Included in your student guide is a salute evaluation worksheet that provides guidelines for rendering a proper salute.
To salute properly, however, you need to practice and that is what we are going to do now.
Instructor Note: This is a good opportunity to get students on their feet and to provide a short break from academics.
Show students the proper position of attention and demonstrate the salute.
After you CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 41 demonstrate a proper salute, have students pair up and practice saluting each other while you observe them.
Make sure students are at the position of attention when saluting.
Tell them to use the salute evaluation checklist to make sure each student can demonstrate a proper salute.
As you observe students practicing, pick out members who salute especially well and then have them demonstrate a salute to the entire class while you praise their efforts.
Tell students to continue to practice saluting at home in front of a mirror using this evaluation checklist until they are satisfied that they can render a proper hand salute.
Use senior cadets to assist you in this exercise.
SALUTE EVALUATION Ã¯Â¿Â½ Raise right hand smartly along the buttons of the jacket or shirt.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Extend and join the forefingers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Place the thumb along the forefingers.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Keep the palm flat.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Face the palm toward the body.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Tilt the palm slightly toward the face.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hold the upper arm horizontal, slightly forward of the body and parallel to the ground.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ensure the tip of the middle finger touches the outside corner of the right eyebrow or the front corner of the glasses.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Keep the rest of the body at attention.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ To lower the salute, bring the arm smoothly and smartly downward retracing the same path.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Return to the position of attention.
Question: What does a salute represent? Answer: A salute represents mutual trust and respect.
Transition: to salute.
Show Slide: Now that you know how to render a snappy salute, the next step is to learn who and when Saluting State: When in military-style uniform, you salute the President of the US, Medal of Honor Recipients (regardless of rank), and officers and warrant officers of the Armed Forces (including foreign officers) who are senior in rank to you.
This does not mean you have to learn the rank of every officer for every country you may encounter.
If unsure, it never hurts to salute.
You should also salute staff cars on military installations when a flag or metal standard identifies the rank of the occupant.
Saluting Who Ã¯Â¿Â½ President Ã¯Â¿Â½ Medal of Honor recipients Ã¯Â¿Â½ Officers and WOs senior in rank When Ã¯Â¿Â½ In military-style uniform Ã¯Â¿Â½ Outdoors unless...
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Indoors if reporting 42 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 State: There are times, however, when a salute is impractical or not required.
These include when you are carrying articles in both hands, when you are in a no salute area such as a flight line, when you are a member of a work detail unless in charge, when attending a public gathering such as a sporting event, or when indoors.
The only time you salute indoors is when officially reporting to an officer senior in rank or participating as a member of a color guard.
State: Military personnel are not required to render a salute to CAP personnel, but they are not restricted from doing so if they desire.
Transition: Let us now learn the proper way to stand at Attention, and also learn the Rest positions in basic drill.
You' need to learn these as you begin to participate more and more in squadron activities.
ll Instructor Note: Just as you showed the students how to render the salute, now teach them the proper ways to assume the positions of Attention, Parade Rest, At Ease, and At Rest.
Be sure to use senior cadets to assist you in this exercise.
Refer to CAPM 50-14, Drill and Ceremonies.
Transition to MP 5: Another time to demonstrate your salute is when paying tribute to the flag.
MP 5.
Honors to the National Flag State: The US National Flag is a symbol of the principles and ideals the country stands for and should always be treated with respect.
The National Anthem and Pledge of Allegiance honor the flag and should receive the same respect.
When indoors in military-style uniform, you should stand at attention and remain silent during the playing of the National Anthem.
If indoors in civilian clothes or in a nonmilitary-style CAP uniform such as the blazer combination, you should stand at attention and place your right hand over your heart.
State: On military installations, the flag is normally honored with a retreat ceremony at the end of the duty day.
If outdoors in military-style uniform during retreat, you should stop and face the flag or face in the direction of the music if the flag is not visible.
Assume the position of Parade Rest during the sounding of retreat.
When the National Anthem or To the Colors begins, you should come to attention and salute until the last note of the music.
If outdoors in civilian clothes, stand at attention and place your right hand over your heart during the National Anthem.
If a parade carrying the flag passes you, you should salute if in military-style uniform or stand at attention if in civilian clothes.
State: You do not recite the Pledge of Allegiance while in military formation.
If outdoors in military uniform during the pledge, you should stand at attention facing the flag and salute while remaining silent.
If indoors in military-style uniform, stand at attention, face the flag but do not salute.
You may recite the pledge indoors if not in formation.
If in civilian clothes, indoors or outdoors, stand at attention, face the flag, place your right hand over your heart, and recite the pledge.
To learn more about honors and display of the flag see CAPP 151.
Question: What do the 13 red and white stripes on the American Flag represent? CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 43 Answer: They represent the original 13 colonies and the blood and sacrifice shed for America to gain its freedom.
Transition to Practical Evaluation: Now we will look at some scenarios to test your knowledge of what we have learned about customs and courtesies.
Practical Evaluation Instructor Note: Present the following scenarios to the students and have them respond appropriately.
Give as many students as possible the opportunity to participate by calling on individuals to respond to questions like: Do you agree with what he/she just said? Question 1: You are outdoors on a military installation wearing the military-style blue service dress uniform.
You hear the music sound retreat followed by the National Anthem.
What actions should you take? Answer: As soon as you hear the sound of retreat, you should stop and come to the position of attention, then assume the position of Parade Rest facing the flag or in the direction of the music if the flag is not visible.
Maintain the position of Parade Rest until retreat is finished.
When the first note of the National Anthem begins, you should come back to the position of attention and salute.
Hold the salute until the last note of the National Anthem, finish the salute smartly and proceed.
Question 2: You are indoors wearing the blazer combination at an awards ceremony honoring a member of your unit.
The National Anthem begins.
What action do you take? Answer: Rise when the anthem begins and stand at attention placing your right hand over your heart.
Question 3: You are a cadet captain walking with a major to a squadron meeting when you meet another major? What customs and courtesies are involved? Answer: As a captain, you should be walking to the major' left.
When you meet the second major, you should s salute first.
The majors should exchange greetings but no salute is required.
Question 4: You are in a room waiting for a meeting to begin.
The highest ranking member present is a major.
What action should you take if you see a lieutenant colonel walk into the room? Answer: You should call the room to attention and all in the room should stand unless directed otherwise by the lieutenant colonel.
Question 5: You are about to enter a vehicle to accompany the squadron commander to an awards ceremony.
What is the proper protocol for entering and exiting the vehicle? 44 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 Answer: As a cadet, you should enter the car first.
When you arrive at your destination, the senior member exits first.
MP 6.
Customs and Courtesies of the Local Unit and Wing Instructor Note: This section is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss any particular customs and courtesies unique to your unit.
If your unit has an annual dining-out or similar ceremonies, you might share something about this function.
Encourage new members to participate in functions and ceremonies that celebrate the uniqueness of Civil Air Patrol as the Auxiliary of the US Air Force.
Remember customs and courtesies are akin to accepted practices of etiquette in the civilian world which show respect and politeness for coworkers.

Relationship Between Training and Advancement Show Slide: Four Phases of the Cadet Program State: We' go through each of the four phases of the cadet program in detail and discuss the four ll components in these phases.
Then we' discuss how advancement through the four phases of the cadet ll program are key to your advancement through the cadet ranks, and your eligibility to attend the many cadet activities which are available to you.
State: The cadet program is split into four phases; and further into a series of 15 achievements.
Each achievement gets increasingly more complex and is designed to challenge cadets to demonstrate what they' learned in a variety of real-world situations.
ve Show Slide: Components of the Cadet Program Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Components of the Cadet Program Aerospace Education Leadership Physical Fitness Moral Leadership State: Each phase of the Cadet Program has four components: aerospace education, leadership, physical fitness, and moral leadership.
Let' look at these in a little more detail.
s State: The aerospace education component is self-study and activity based.
You will receive the book Aerospace: Flight of Discovery when your initial cadet packet arrives in the mail.
The book is divided into six chapters and you will begin to read the book when you complete Achievement 1.
You may also take part in many challenging aerospace education activities such as model rocketry, orientation flights, aerospace current events discussions, and a variety of other programs.
These activities will help you to better understand what you learn from the workbook.
At the end of each chapter, you will be given a multiple choice test.
To pass and move on, you must receive a grade of 70% or above.
State: The leadership component is also based on self-study and practical exercises.
You' receive the ll series of books titled Leadership 2000 and Beyond in your packet.
This fifteen chapter series (one for each achievement) teaches you about leadership, management, and other topics.
You' also receive a ll drill and ceremonies manual.
Drill and ceremonies are very important to the cadet program.
Through drill you will learn to be part of a team, and eventually you' learn to lead through drill.
At the end of ll each chapter, you will be given a multiple choice test.
To pass, you must receive a grade of 70% or above.
There is also a practical drill and ceremonies test that you must pass at the end of Chapter 1.
State: The third component is physical fitness.
In order to participate in many of the activities available in CAP, you must have both physical and mental stamina.
You must be active and have enough strength to be part of the CAP team.
The CAP Physical Fitness Program is designed to help you gain the necessary stamina to participate in CAP activities and help you to create a healthy lifestyle.
You are evaluated for each achievement with the Cadet Physical Fitness Test.
This test is comprised of a 1-mile run (or 400-yard swim alternative), sit-ups, and a sit-and-reach flexibility test.
You must achieve a certain number of points for each achievement.
If you are a cadet who may not be able to fully participate in the PT program, you still have options.
Please speak to your squadron commander about how you may participate in a limited PT program.
48 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 State: Finally, there is the moral leadership component.
This time is spent talking about individual moral beliefs in a group environment.
Morals are basically a person' values or personal beliefs about s what is right and wrong.
Though you must participate in these discussions, you will not be evaluated on what you think, believe, or express.
The point is to have you examine your own values while looking at current issues and events in society.
Show Slide: Four Phases of the Cadet Program Four Phases of the Cadet Program Phase I Phase II The Beginning Phase The Learning Phase Mitchell Award Phase III The Leadership Phase Earhart Award Phase IV The Executive Phase Eaker Award Spaatz Award State: As we' said, the cadet program is split into four phases.
ve As you progress, you will be given more authority and responsibility.
When you complete Phases II, III, and IV, you will test for special awards which will give you benefits inside and outside of CAP.
State: The first phase of the cadet program is called The Beginning Phase.
It consists of the first achievement and begins when the cadet has joined CAP.
You are taking part in Phase I as you sit here.
In this phase, you must become familiar with and follow uniform standards and basic customs and courtesies.
You complete Phase I when you successfully pass the leadership and physical fitness tests, and participate in the required moral leadership discussion for Achievement 1.
Show Slide: Phase II Phase II (Mitchell Award) Achievements 2 - 7 Aerospace Education Leadership Physical Fitness Moral Leadership Encampment State: Phase II of the cadet program is called The Learning Phase and is comprised of Achievements 2 - 7.
In Phase II, you will begin to learn more about the aerospace world as you study Aerospace: Flight of Discovery.
As you progress, you will also take on leadership and staff roles within your unit.
You will also be required to attend a CAP encampment during this phase.
Show Slide: CAP Encampment CAP Encampment State: The CAP encampment is a requirement for Phase II completion and is designed to give cadets like yourself an opportunity to apply the training you have received in a militarystyle environment.
It also gives you an intense orientation to CAP and Air Force missions and their capabilities.
Many cadets consider the CAP encampments among their fondest experiences and return year after year as staff members.
When you complete the encampment, you will be eligible to attend a variety of special activities at the national level, many of which we' talk about later.
ll Aerospace Education Leadership Relationship Between CAP and USAF USAF Basic Aerospace Doctrine Physical Fitness CAP Missions Volume 1 CAPP 50-9 (E) 49 State: After you have completed a CAP encampment and finished Achievement 7, you will be eligible to take the General Billy Mitchell Award Examination.
It' named after Brigadier General Billy s Mitchell, a career Army officer and advocate of a separate Air Force.
It is largely through his work that the US Air Force became a separate service.
The Mitchell Exam is a multiple choice test covering aerospace and leadership topics from the material you' read.
When you pass this test, you will be ready to go on to Phase III of the cadet program, be ve able to apply for a variety of scholarships, and share what you' learned with other cadets. ve Show Slide: Phase III Phase III (Earhart Award) Achievements 8 - 11 Leadership Staff Duty Analysis Physical Fitness Moral Leadership State: Phase III is called The Leadership Phase.
This is where you will begin to put what you' learned to work.
It encompasses ve Achievements 8 - 11.
You will be a cadet officer and will assume leadership and managerial roles within the unit.
You' also begin to ll learn about the staff positions within your unit through a program called Staff Duty Analysis (SDA) that replaces the self-study portion of AE.
You' learn about a squadron staff position in each achievement ll and will be expected to perform some of the duties of those positions.
When you complete Achievement 11, you can then test for the Amelia Earhart Award, named after the famed aviation pioneer who was lost while attempting to be the first female pilot to fly around the world.
Like the Mitchell Exam, this test is multiple choice and will cover all the material you have learned.
When you pass, you will move on to Phase IV, assume even more challenging roles, and have a chance to take part in even more activities.
Show Slide: Phase IV Phase IV (Eaker Award) Achievements 12 - 15 Leadership Staff Duty Analysis Physical Fitness Moral Leadership Spaatz Award State: The final phase of the cadet program is called The Executive Phase.
Phase IV encompasses Achievements 12 - 15 and allows you to hone your skills.
You' continue with leadership, SDA, physical ll fitness, and moral leadership.
Many of you will become cadet commanders of your units or will be cadet commanders at other activities.
When you complete Achievement 15, you will be awarded the General Ira C. Eaker Award, named after a career Army Air Force officer and key architect of the US Air Force.
You can then test for the most prestigious award in the cadet program, the General Carl A. Spaatz Award.
The Spaatz Award is named after the first Chief of Staff of the US Air Force and the first Chairman of the CAP National Board.
50 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 The Spaatz Examination consists of four parts: aerospace, leadership, moral leadership essay, and physical fitness.
You must pass all four parts to receive the Spaatz Award.
The exam is so challenging that only a few people receive the award annually.
If you do receive it, however, you will have received the highest honor for cadet achievement in CAP.
Transition to MP 2: You may see some cadets wearing what looks like stripes on their shirt or circles or diamonds on their shoulders.
This is the grade I was talking about.
Grade is simply a symbol of the level of advancement a cadet has achieved within the cadet program.
MP 2.
Relationship Between Training and Advancement Show Slide: Cadet Grades Cadet Basic Phase II Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet First Class Sergeant Staff Sergeant Technical Sergeant Master Sergeant Phase III Flight Officer Second Lieutenant First Lieutenant Phase IV Captain Major Lieutenant Colonel Spaatz Award Colonel Cadet Grades Phase I Instructor Note: Have cadets turn to the grade structure handout in their workbook to show them what cadet grade looks like.
State: Cadets receive grade commensurate with their level of achievement within the cadet program.
A cadet progresses through the enlisted grades of the cadet program in Phases I and II.
When they receive the Mitchell, they become cadet officers and progress through the cadet officer grade structure.
Cadets may not be promoted to a grade higher than the grade listed for the achievement.
Promotion to a higher grade shows the members around you that you are ready to take on more responsibility.
Normally, achievements cannot be completed in less than 2-month intervals.
This means that cadets may not normally be promoted Cadet faster than once every 2 months.
This is to ensure that the cadets have enough time to absorb and use what they' learned.
There is an exception, however, for those cadets enrolled in JROTC programs.
ve Cadets must still test, but they can test to complete achievements at a slightly faster rate, depending on the length of their JROTC service.
If you are enrolled in JROTC, check with your squadron commander to see if you qualify.
Transition to MP 3: Thus far we' looked at the mechanics of the cadet program, now we' going to ve re take a look at some of the responsibilities you have as a cadet to your unit and to the program itself.
Volume 1 CAPP 50-9 (E) 51 MP 3.
Responsibilities to the Unit and Cadet Program Show Slide: CAP Cadet Responsibilities CAP Cadet Responsibilities Ã¯Â¿Â½ Membership is a privilege Ã¯Â¿Â½ Membership requirements Ã¯Â¿Â½ Membership termination State: Membership in CAP is a privilege reserved for those who want to promote the goals and purposes of CAP.
As a CAP cadet, you are required to pay annual membership dues, regularly attend meetings, receive good grades in school, meet training requirements, and participate in unit activities.
Specific requirements for cadet membership are shown in CAPM 39-2.
State: Because CAP cadet membership is a privilege, you may be removed from the cadet program under certain circumstances.
You may be removed for cause for incidents such as dropping out of school or failure to maintain a satisfactory school record, not advancing in the CAP program, failure to regularly attend meetings, failure to renew, loss of status as "admitted for permanent residence" if not a US citizen, and misconduct.
Incidences of this nature are rare.
But, you may also be removed from the cadet membership roles before the age of 21 if you marry, become pregnant, or join the military as an active duty member (barring the military academies).
In these instances, you may elect to join CAP as a senior member.
Transition to MP 4: Another responsibility you have is to be familiar with two very important policies concerning you in CAP: the Cadet Protection Policy and CAP' policy on hazing. s MP 4.
Civil Air Patrol Policy on Cadet Protection and Hazing Show Slide: Cadet Protection Policy and Hazing Cadet Protection Policy CAP Policy on Hazing State: Civil Air Patrol has instituted the Cadet Protection Policy and the policy on hazing for your protection.
These policies are designed to both screen members who have had histories of criminal behavior against children and define acceptable forms of corrective behavior within the cadet program.
State: The Cadet Protection Policy is a system designed to screen out adult members who have had histories of criminal behavior involving children and to describe CAP' policies to protect children from s sexual abuse while attending CAP activities.
Adults who wish to become senior members must be fingerprinted and checked by the FBI before they can work with you.
They must also take special training to learn about child abuse, how they can prevent it, and what to do if they learn of it happening.
If a member fails to complete either one of these requirements, they will not be allowed to work with you.
State: The policy also says that if someone suspects that a cadet is being hurt, it will be reported and investigated and that the cadet will be protected.
Let me assure you though, that instances of such behavior are very rare, and CAP takes these actions to prevent abuse from happening.
Finally, it also educates parents on CAP' policy through a booklet called The Cadet Protection Policy and Program s for Parent and Leaders.
You will receive this booklet in your cadet packet; when you do, please give it to your parents.
52 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 State: CAP also prohibits members from hazing other members.
The term hazing implies any behavior that singles out a member for punishment or harassment.
It also means that members may not be punished for being pushed beyond their limits or that corrective action given to a member be so harsh that it injures the member.
An example would be if someone made you exercise to exhaustion.
Transition to MP 5: As we' said before, we have these policies to prevent abuse and hazing from ve occurring, and the incidents which do occur are rare.
Part of the reason this is true is because the US Air Force and CAP follow some basic ethical principles called "Core Values."
Core values apply to all CAP members and provide guidelines for acceptable behavior.
MP 5.
The Core Values of the US Air Force and Civil Air Patrol Show Slide: Air Force Core Values Air Force Core Values Integrity First Service Before Self Excellence in All We Do State: First, we' look at Air Force Core Values.
Each core value ll represents a part of our character that helps us to do the right thing.
Its the voice in the back of our head that tells us what' right and wrong.
s State: "Integrity First" means the ability to be honest to others and oneself.
It means standing up in the face of peer pressure to do what' s right.
It also means to not cover up for someone else when what they are doing is wrong.
"Service Before Self" means to put your personal wants aside for something that is bigger.
For instance, let' say you' agreed to help clean the squadron building with your fellow cadets.
The morning s ve you' supposed to go, your brother offers to take you to the beach.
You' got people counting on you re ve to help out and you' already agreed to help them.
If you believe in service before self, then you know ve you' got to do what you' promised and clean the building.
ve ve "Excellence in All We Do" means that you do the best you can, no matter what it may be.
You may not be the best cadet when it comes to drilling in formation, but you practice and you give it 100% every time.
You do this not only for CAP, but you also do it for yourself.
It feels good to know you' given ve everything you can.
Transition: There are seven CAP "Core Values" that reflect the Air Force core values.
Show Slide: CAP Core Values State: In addition to the Air Force core values of Integrity, Excellence, and Service Before Self (Volunteerism), CAP adds the following core values of: "Trust" - it' the foundation for everything we s do in CAP; "Dependability" - knowing that all members will come through; "Respect" - for ourselves and our fellow members; and finally, "Fun" - the reason why you' joined CAP in the first place.
ve Volume 1 CAPP 50-9 (E) 53 Transition to MP 6: We have looked at the structure of the cadet program, the responsibilities of cadets to CAP, and have seen why core values are so important to the members.
Now, let' turn to some s of the benefits of cadet membership.
MP 6.
Benefits of Membership in Civil Air Patrol Show Slide: Member Benefits CAP Core Values Integrity Excellence Volunteerism Trust Dependability Respect Fun Member Benefits Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Training Uniforms Awards Orientation Flights Model Rocketry building Flight Training Activities at all levels Scholarships Advanced placement when enlisting in the USAF Ã¯Â¿Â½ Advanced placement in AFROTC Ã¯Â¿Â½ Special consideration for the USAF Academy Prep School State: Most people who join a volunteer organization do so for many reasons.
Mostly, it' a mix of wanting to do something for their s community while wanting to do something fun for themselves.
Many cadets like yourself, for instance, want to fly or join the military.
You also want to help the community; that is why most cadets like yourself participate in the emergency services mission.
Whatever the reason, CAP provides you with many benefits which you will enjoy both while you are a cadet and when you move on, possibly to senior membership, or other activities which you find rewarding.
State: One of the most important benefits is training.
You have the chance to get technical training, learn to operate a ham radio, navigation systems, computers, first aid skills, and many other skills.
But, more importantly, you learn self-discipline, you learn management and communications skills.
You learn to be part of a team.
This will be very important as you get a job, go on to college, and find your place in the world.
State: Part of being part of a team is being recognized.
The uniform you wear shows that you are part of the CAP team, and in the larger picture, the Air Force team.
The Air Force blue uniform is a symbol of the contributions that millions of people have made to the defense of America and to public service.
Not everyone can wear the CAP uniform, it is a privilege which goes hand in hand with CAP membership.
54 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 State: As we' learned, as you complete the achievements in the cadet program, you can receive the ve Mitchell, Earhart, Eaker, and Spaatz awards.
But there are also many other types of awards you can receive for service and for good performance.
For instance, you can receive awards and ribbons for participating in emergency services missions; the Find ribbon is for actually finding an actual mission target and the SAR and Disaster Relief ribbons recognize the amount of time and training you put into actual missions.
You can earn ribbons for participating in encampments and national special activities.
You can earn a ribbon for recruiting new members and for your time in CAP.
You can also earn awards for excellent performance and even for saving a life.
These are just a few of the ways you can be recognized for all the good things you can do in CAP.
State: CAP is not just sitting in a classroom or drilling in the gymnasium.
You can take part in all types of exciting activities.
A good example is orientation flights.
Did you know that you are eligible to take up to nine flights in CAP aircraft? Each flight will expose you to the different forces of flight, navigation, communication, and cross-country flight techniques.
You will either fly with CAP or Air Force pilots, and you may even fly in a military aircraft! You can also learn about rocket flight through building model rockets and launching them yourself.
Model rockets range from simple to build, small rockets which can be launched easily, to more complicated rockets that reach thousands of feet into the air! Many CAP units and wings have model rocket competitions to see which ones are the best looking and highest flying! State: Would you like to learn to fly? Civil Air Patrol gives you many ways to learn.
CAP offers flight scholarships ranging from $150 - $2,100 if you qualify.
You can also attend the National Flight Academy - CAP' flagship flight activity.
This network of flight encampments across the country will s teach you the basics of powered or sail plane flight - you may even solo! In addition, there are many flight encampments run by CAP wings and regions so chances are you can learn to fly close to home! Show Slide: CAP Activities CAP Activities Ã¯Â¿Â½ International Air Cadet Exchange (IACE) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cadet Officer School (COS) Ã¯Â¿Â½ National Flight Academies (NFA) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Orientation Course Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jacksonville University/COMAIR Academy Airline Training Track Ã¯Â¿Â½ Blue Beret Ã¯Â¿Â½ Pararescue Orientation Course (PJOC) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Advanced Pararescue Orientation Course (APJOC) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Air Education and Training Command Familiarization Course (AETCFC) Ã¯Â¿Â½ AF Space Command Familiarization Course (AFSCFC) Ã¯Â¿Â½ National Ground Search and Rescue School (NGSAR) Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hawk Mountain Ranger School Ã¯Â¿Â½ National Cadet Summer Encampment State: In addition to the National Flight Academies, there are many more national activities you can attend.
There are activities to fit every interest.
You can begin by attending th e National Cadet Summe r Encampment to satisfy Mitchell Award requirements.
If you like to fly, you can attend the Flight Academies (powered or glider), Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Orientation Course, AETC Familiarization Course, or the Space Comman d Familiarization Course.
If you want to be on a CAP ground team and learn survival skills, you can attend Hawk Mountain, NGSAR, or PJOC.
After PJOC, you can go to APJOC.
If you like air shows and want to be part of the largest air show in America, then Blue Beret may be for you.
If you want to excel as a cadet officer and become a better leader, COS might be the activity for you.
And, once you have become a senior cadet leader you can share your experiences with the world as an ambassador with IACE! Volume 1 CAPP 50-9 (E) 55 While some activities have age requirements or minimum grade (rank) requirements, all activities (except for the National Cadet Encampment) require that you must have completed a CAP encampment.
Makes it easy to plan, doesn' it.
This summer you can go to the CAP encampment and next summer t you can go apply for these special activities.
It' a lot to shoot for, isn' it? s t State: CAP can also help you if you want to go to college.
CAP has many academic scholarships that you can apply for.
These scholarships cover a wide range of categories including the flight scholarships mentioned earlier, undergraduate and graduate academic and vocational scholarships, and ministerial scholarships.
Awards range from $750 to full tuition coverage.
And you can apply year after year, so CAP can really help you make a dent in college tuition.
State: Finally, CAP cadet membership can be a great help if you choose to join the Air Force.
Cadets with the Mitchell Award can enlist in the Air Force with the advanced pay grade of E-3 (Airman First Class).
Its worth about $150 more a month in pay and it puts you up to 18 months ahead of your peers when it comes to promotions! CAP membership can also help you if you want to become an officer.
Mitchell recipients can qualify to have the first two semesters of AFROTC General Officer Course waived.
You can qualify for three and four semester waivers if you have more CAP cadet grade.
Finally, as a CAP cadet, you can be nominated for special appointment to the Air Force Academy Preparatory School.
If you qualify, appointment to this school can help you to be accepted to the Air Force Academy.
This is a great opportunity to get a commission in the US Air Force.
Transition to MP 7: There just isn' enough time to tell you about all the CAP benefits you can receive t in the cadet program.
All we want to do here is whet your appetite.
We know you have more questions, and you can find out more by asking your cadet commander or squadron commander.
You can also find out yourself by looking at the CAP regulations and manuals in your unit.
This brings us to the next area we want to look at: CAP publications and indexes.
MP 7.
Civil Air Patrol Publications and Indexes Show Slides: CAP Publications and Indexes CAP Publications and Indexes 0 5 10 20 35 39 50 55 60 Indexes Publications Management Administrative Communications Organization and Mission Personnel Procedures Personnel - General Training Operations Flying State: During this course, we have made many references to CAP manuals and publications.
As you progress in the cadet program, you' find that you will frequently reference these publications to ll answer questions you have or to study your Staff Duty Analysis.
You can find copies of CAP publications at the squadron; just ask the administrative officer if you can look at them.
56 CAPP 50-9 (E) Volume 1 State: As you can see, CAP regulations cover many different subjects.
For now though, you just need to remember that the Cadet Training Program is covered in CAPM 50-16, and uniform wear is covered in CAPM 39-1.
If you have a question that is not covered, then the 0 series of CAP directives is where you need to start.
This series is the index of all CAP publications, and it shows you where you need to look.
Transition to MP 8: Now, before we go, I want to talk to you for a minute about the specific responsibilities and benefits which are connected to belonging to this unit.
MP 8.
Local Unit/Wing Responsibilities and Benefits Instructor Note: You may want to create a chart or slide to cover the areas that apply to your particular unit and wing.
If you have already covered the material elsewhere, go ahead and summarize the lesson.
Summary: Show Slide: Main Points CAP Publications 
Acknowledge significant contributions and points made by students during the discussion, and ask if there are any questions.
CLOSURE: That' it.
You now have a pretty good idea of s what CAP is and what you need to do to excel.
We' pass ll out the graduation certificates in a minute, but before we do that, I want you to go to the back of your book and fill out the end-of-course evaluation.
It will just take a few minutes.
Instructor Note: Be sure to pass out the graduation certificates at the conclusion of this segment.
We suggest that the unit commander assist you in this process; it will build confidence in the new cadets.
