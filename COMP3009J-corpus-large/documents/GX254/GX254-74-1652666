T HE MINERAL I NDUSTRY OF VIRGINIA This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Virginia Division of Mineral Resources for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.
Virginia climbed in rank from 25th to 22d among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value1 in 1996, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The estimated value for 1996 was almost $529 million, a nearly 3% increase from that of 1995.
This followed a 2.6% increase in 1995 from 1994 (based on final 1995 data).
In 1996, the State accounted for about 1.5% of the U.S. total nonfuel mineral production value.
Virginia mines almost exclusively produce industrial minerals and coal.
The last significant metal production occurred in 1981 when the State's only consistently active metal mine, an underground zinc operation, closed down because of the recession and a depressed metal market.
While a diverse variety of minerals were produced in 1996 in Virginia, crushed stone accounted for 64% of the State's nonfuel mineral value.
In 1996, the value of crushed stone increased by about $13 million, the most of any nonfuel mineral in Virginia for the year.
From 1990 through 1996, Virginia produced more than 360 million metric tons of crushed stone, or an average of 51.6 million metric tons per year.
Compared with 1995, most nonfuel mineral commodities increased in value.
Portland cement, kyanite, common clays, vermiculite, and gemstone values all decreased by small amounts.
Based on USGS estimates of quantities produced in the 50 States during 1996, Virginia remained the only State to mine kyanite, second in the production of feldspar, second of two States that produce vermiculite, fourth in iron oxide pigments, and ninth in crushed stone.
The State dropped in rank from eighth to ninth in the production of lime.
While the only producing kyanite mine in the United States was in Virginia, mullite, a calcined kyanite, was synthetically produced in three other States.
About 90% of U.S. kyanite and mullite output is used in refractories for the smelting and processing of a variety of metals and in glass and high-temperature ceramics manufacturing.
Additionally, significant quantities of construction and industrial sand and gravel, masonry cement, and common clays were produced in the State.
The following narrative information was provided by the Virginia Division of Mineral Resources (VDMR).2 Several companies conducted reconnaissance geologic, geochemical, and geophysical investigations for base and precious metals in the central Piedmont province of Virginia.
Gold Crown Mining Co. continued to permit and intermittently work the old Kentuck Mine, east of Danville, Pittsylvania County, for small amounts of gold; and Southern Piedmont Mining continued to permit the old Moss gold mine in Goochland County.
JLJ Enterprises was not active in processing any ore during the year from its permitted site near the Goochland County-Fluvanna County line.
During the early spring of 1996, the Harris Group purchased U.S. Silica Co., including the Montpelier operation in Hanover County, north of Richmond, which quarried and processed glass-grade feldspar.
During the spring, Golden Cat, a Division of Ralston Purina Co., began construction of a cat box filler manufacturing plant, about 40 kilometers northeast of Richmond, in King William County.
The plant and other related costs for the Virginia facility were estimated to total up to $25 million.
Increased tax revenues for the county were anticipated to be about $50,000 per year and up, and the new plant will hire about 70 people.
The company plans to begin producing cat litter box filler products in July 1997.
In August, Cyprus Foote Mineral Co. shut down its lithium hydroxide plant at Sunbright, Scott County, in the southwestern part of the Commonwealth in deference to producing all of its lithium-carbonate at its new facility in Silver Peak, NV.
In November, U.S. Gypsum Co. announced that it will be closing its wallboard plant in Plasterco, VA (near Saltville) as well as its slope-entry underground gypsum mine in adjacent Smyth County in May 1999.
The company will build a modern $110-million plant in Bridgeport, AL, which will open soon after the Virginia operation (which has been in operation for 75 years) closes.
At the end of the year, RGC (USA Minerals) was constructing a plant southwest of Stony Creek, in Sussex County, to mine heavy-mineral sand in adjacent Dinwiddie County.
The company will invest about $20 million in preparation of its plant and open pit mine; water will be pumped from the Nottoway River, about 3 kilometers away, to the plant.
1 VIRGINIA--1996 Cedar Mountain Stone continued to operate two crushed stone operations--its granite quarry in Louisa County, as well as a diabase quarry, near Mitchells in Culpeper County.
The company has stripped a site just west of State Road 615 and opened up a dimension stone quarry; in the early fall, Cedar Mountain began sending blocks of granite, by truck, to a finishing plant in Georgia.
The VDMR continued geologic mapping in several counties at a detailed 1:24,000 scale and continued to compile and digitize l:l00,000-scale maps.
The agency also continued field studies and compilation of identified mineral resources on 1:24,000-scale maps, the statewide carbonate project, the epithermal hot springs study, the coalbed methane resources study, and oil and gas studies of Dickenson County and Russell County.
Completed during 1996 were a study on diamonds in Virginia; the Wise County oil and gas study; and a statistics report on the 1995 production of coal, oil and gas, and industrial and metallic mineral resources in Virginia.
Published during the year were a study on the geology and mineral resources of Henry County and the City of Martinsville; a composite Devonian and Lower Mississippian geologic cross section near Norton, VA; a structural geologic cross section across the Atlantic Coastal plain; a 1:100,000- scale geologic map of Clarke, Frederick, Page , Shena ndoah, and Warren Counties; and a statistics report on coal, oil and gas, and industrial and metallic mineral resources produced in the Commonwealth during 1994.
---------- The terms "nonfuel mineral production" and related "values" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products.
Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity.
All 1996 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are estimates as of February 1997.
For some commodities (for example, construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement), estimates are updated periodically.
