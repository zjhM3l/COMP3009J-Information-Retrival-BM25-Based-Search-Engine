On 8 s December 1941, (6)_______________________ became the first National Commander and Gill Robb Wilson became the first Executive Officer.
Wartime Activities One of the first missions CAP was called upon to perform was (7)____________________.
This was due to the attack of American shipping by the (8)_________ up and down the eastern and southeastern coasts of the United States.
The Army and Navy did not have the resources at the time to stop the attacks, and CAP was called on to track these submarines.
When a sub was spotted, CAP pilots would radio the Army or Navy for help.
This worked well until the sub crews figured out that the CAP aircraft were unarmed.
In response, the Army authorized CAP planes to be armed with (9)____________________________________.
In May 1942, a CAP aircraft manned by (10)_______________ and (11)___________________ received the first CAP "kill" by sinking a submarine off the coast of New Jersey.
By August 1943, the Army and Navy had enough resources to resume coastal patrol on their own.
CAP' tally was s impressive.
CAP pilots sank (12)____ subs, attacked 57, and spotted many more.
Other WW II Missions Civil Air Patrol' efforts were not limited to coastal patrol.
From the s period January 1942 - January 1946, CAP pilots flew over 24,000 hours of assigned (13)_________________________ missions plus Ã¯Â¿Â½ Search and Rescue (SAR) many thousands of additional hours at their own expense.
In Nevada, Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cargo and Courier CAP SAR teams formed their own cavalry to rescue crews through Ã¯Â¿Â½ Border Patrol Ã¯Â¿Â½ Aerial Target Towing tough terrain, and in Florida SAR teams used glade buggies to rescue Ã¯Â¿Â½ Searchlight and Radar Training crews from swamp areas.

The Cadet Program During World War II Many adults were leaving CAP because they were being (22)_______________________. volunteering to assist the military, they had to leave CAP.
Since CAP was As a result, CAP had to find more members to perform their missions.
They found that young people could do many jobs just as well as adults, and CAP and the Army Air Forces (AAF) made plans to open CAP membership to young people.
In this way, the (23)_____________ as they would be called, would train in CAP jobs, maybe learn to fly, and gain experience which would help them when they became old enough to join the military.
The CAP cadet program was started on (24)_______________________, in Minnesota.
The program was so successful that when CAP received its Congressional Charter and its status as the US Air Force Auxiliary, it became a primary mission: co-equal with emergency services and aerospace education.
It has evolved and grown into the program you are now in today.
CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 3 Civil Air Patrol During the Post-war Period During the last 2 years of the war, CAP continued to accomplish vital missions until the (25)_________________ surrender in September 1945 and a period of massive demobilization began.
DEMOBILIZATION: to reduce the size of the military structure after a war in order to save money or resources.
Despite proving itself with many wartime missions, CAP' future was (26)__________ after the war.
The drastic s cut in post-war budgets threatened to cut-off much AAF funding which led General Arnold to call a meeting of CAP wing Public Law 476 commanders to develop a plan for the future of Civil Air Patrol.
The conference led to the incorporation of Civil Air Patrol as a Corporation "solely of a benevolent character " on (27)______________________.
This was done through the passing of (28)_________________________.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage the development of aviation Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage contributions to public welfare Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide aviation education and training Ã¯Â¿Â½ Foster civil aviation Ã¯Â¿Â½ Private citizens assist in emergencies Very briefly, this law established the foundations for CAP' three primary missions of aerospace education, s emergency services, and the cadet program.
Based on these missions, CAP set forth a number of post-war objectives: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Inform the (29)__________about aviation and its impacts Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide seniors and cadets with ground and pre-flight Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Post-war Objectives Ã¯Â¿Â½ Inform the public (30)_________education and training Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide ground and pre-flight training Provide air service under emergency conditions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide emergency air service Establish a radio network covering all parts of the United Ã¯Â¿Â½ Establish a radio network States for both training and emergency use Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage flying clubs Encourage the establishment of flying clubs for its Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide cadet encampments membership Ã¯Â¿Â½ Provide cadet flight scholarships Provide selected (31)____________ a 2-week encamp-ment at Ã¯Â¿Â½ Encourage model building and flying Ã¯Â¿Â½ Assist veteran employment air bases Provide selected cadets with (32)_____________ scholarships Ã¯Â¿Â½ Contribute to special projects Encourage model building and flying Assist veterans to find employment Contribute services to special projects such as airport development and aerial surveying Post-war objectives that are no longer needed: ______________________________________________________________________ ____________________ ______________________________________________________________________ ____________________ ______________________________________________________________________ ____________________ ______________________________________________________________________ ____________________ ______________________________________________________________________ ____________________ ______________________________________________________________________ ____________________ 4 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 CAP: The USAF Auxiliary Public Law 476 gave CAP new life but real permanence would come with the birth of the new US Air Force.

Cadet roles in aerospace education and emergency services CAP Vision and Mission If you' remember from the CAP history lesson, CAP was chartered by Congress after World War II under Public ll Law 476 to perform missions "solely of a benevolent character."
BENEVOLENCE: an inclination or tendency to perform kind or charitable acts This implies that CAP is not allowed to perform combat operations.
Had this charter been adopted before WW II, then CAP would not have been allowed to participate in armed reconnaissance missions against German submarines.
However, the Congressional Charter allows CAP to participate in the other types of missions which it started in WW II, like search and rescue, disaster relief, flight training, and the cadet program.
6 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 Today, CAP is still carrying out the basic missions assigned to it by Congress in 1946, and also responds to new missions for which CAP is ideally suited.
To get an idea of exactly what CAP does and how it seeks to perform those missions, let' take a look at CAP' Vision and Mission Statements.
s s A vision statement declares what an organization wishes to accomplish.
CAP wishes to build the best force of (1)___________to accomplish essential (2)___________ for America.
As a member of CAP, you need to know what CAP seeks to do.
A mission statement spells out those goals.
It defines the objectives that need to be accomplished to carry out those goals.
You can see CAP' mission statement in the frame to the right.
As you can see s (though in different words), it spells out CAP' three primary s missions which are (3)_______________, (4)___________________, and the (5)___________________.
Missions of Civil Air Patrol Aerospace Education Aerospace education represents CAP' effort to educate America s about the uses and benefits of the transportation, communications and military capabilities of the air and space.
The two components in aerospace education are the (6)__________ program, which deals with members of CAP, and the (7)_____________ program, which This program focuses on teachers and students in elementary and junior Cadet Program The cadet program offers young people enrolled in the sixth grade and beyond a chance to develop their leadership skills through interest in (8)__________.
Cadets progress at their own pace through a 15-step program including (9)__________, (10)_________________, (11)__________________, and (12)________________________.

Cadet Programs Aerospace Education Leadership Training Physical Fitness Moral Leadership Cadets can also participate in a wide variety of activities such as encampments, orientation flights, and national and international activities.
You will learn more about cadet programs later in this course; this has just been a quick overview of what the cadet program is.
Emergency Services Emergency services encompasses the search and rescue function which CAP began during WW II.
But, today it encompasses many more activities designed around public service.
CAP' record in emergency services is impressive.
Their air and s ground teams perform over 85 percent of inland missions Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Emergency Services Search and Rescue (SAR) Disaster Relief Humanitarian Services Emergency Communications Network CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 7 (13)___________________________ for the US Air Force, saving over 100 lives each year.
During (14)___________ and other times of need, CAP volunteers provide a variety of services to agencies such as the Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Coast Guard.
These services range from air and ground transportation of supplies and personnel, assistance in evacuation and damage surveying, and establishing communications links through the use of its extensive (15)____________ network.
Other Missions CAP also provides a variety of other missions to support the US Air Force and to support the curtailing of illegal drug transport into the United States.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Air Force Support While CAP has no (16)__________________ capability, it does aerial Ã¯Â¿Â½ Counterdrug surveying, passenger transport, and communications support missions for Ã¯Â¿Â½ Drug Demand Reduction agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the US Customs Service.
CAP also participates in the USAF Drug Demand Reduction Program.
CAP units located near Air Force bases participate in programs designed to educate Air Force and local families about the danger of drugs and presents itself as an attractive alternative to drug and gang activity.
Of all these missions, CAP cadets can take part in all except counterdrug operations.
Now that we' looked at the missions of CAP, let' look at the ve s organizational structure setup to accomplish those missions.
Organization of Civil Air Patrol First we will look at the national organization of CAP so you can see the relationship between the National Headquarters and the USAF as well as the chain of command for CAP units in the field.
The main governing body of Civil Air Patrol is called the (17)______________________________.
It meets usually twice a year to conduct Corporation business and elect officers.
The senior official of the National Board is the (18)_____________________ who holds the grade of CAP brigadier general.

It meets at least twice annually to perform such functions as review and oversight of CAP operations.
The only difference between the National Executive Committee and the National Board is that the NEC does not include CAP' s (20)_______________________.
CAP National Headquarters is actually composed of two separate organizations: the paid corporate staff, representing the interests of the CAP Corporation, and CAP-USAF, which is the military body representing the Air Force - CAP' sponsor.
s The corporate headquarters runs the day-to-day business of CAP at the direction of the National Commander and the National Board.
In addition to the staff of paid corporate employees at CAP National Headquarters, CAP regions have a staff of volunteers headed by a commander who is appointed by the National Commander and other members who perform education, logistics, administrative, and operations functions.
Each wing also has a liaison officer and/or NCO who are retired USAF members.
LIAISON: Communication between different groups or organizations a ; close relationship, connection, or link.
Next, let ' look at the offices of CAP-USAF headed by the s Commander, CAP-USAF.
He also serves as the Senior Air Force Advisor.
CAP-USAF is co-located with the corporate offices at (21)______________________________.
The Commander, CAP-USAF, is the commander for all active duty and DoD civilian employees assigned to (22)_____________________.
His position has ties with the CAP Corporation because he provides advice, liaison, and oversight to HQ CAP, ensuring that the relationship between CAP and the USAF is stable.
Included under CAP-USAF are the region liaison offices that include a commander and small staff.
CAP-USAF assists CAP in acquiring surplus uniforms, equipment, computers, furniture, and vehicles.
They also help CAP by providing transportation to and from certain activities, providing building space, arranging tours, and acting as teachers and board members.

Which type of squadron do you belong to? (30)___________________ Finally, flights are formed under a sponsoring squadron.
This is done when there aren' enough members to form a t squadron and is usually done in lightly populated areas.
Now that you see how CAP is organized, let' see where your unit fits into the structure.
s Where Your Unit Fits Here is how your unit fits into the CAP chain of command.
As your experience with CAP grows, you' learn how the different levels function ll together to accomplish CAP' missions.
s Now, fill in the names of the commanders you have in your chain of command: National Commander :____________________________________ Region Commander:_____________________________________ Wing Commander:______________________________________ Group Commander:_____________________________________ Squadron Commander:__________________________________ CAP Chain of Command CAP Headquarters Your Region Region Commander Your Wing Wing Commander Your Group Group Commander Your Squadron Squadron Commander Your Flight 10 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 Let' also list your cadet chain of command: s Cadet Commander:________________________________________ Cadet First Sergeant:_______________________________________ Cadet Flight Commander:___________________________________ Cadet Flight Sergeant:______________________________________ Element Leader:___________________________________________ Cadet Roles in Aerospace Education and Emergency Services As you know, you are part of the cadet program, and thus have a very important place within CAP.
As you are about to learn, you also play important roles in helping CAP to accomplish its two other primary missions: (31)_______________________ and (32)_________________________.
Cadet Program and Aerospace Education The CAP has much to offer its cadets in aerospace education, such as orientation flights, (33)_________________, model rocketry, flight training, and (34)_________________________________, just to name a few things.
These activities show cadets just like you the importance of aerospace in today' world.
s Cadet Program and Emergency Services Cadets play a very active role in emergency services.
In fact, CAP would not have all the people it needs to accomplish the emergency services missions without cadets! You can train to be part of a (35)___________________ - actively searching for missing airplanes and people - maybe eventually leading the searches.
You can perform administrative support and (37)______________________ at the mission base.
Or you can marshal aircraft on the flight line.
You may even qualify to be part of a mission flight crew! Each of these important functions helps CAP to save lives every year.
Summary In this lesson we' looked at CAP' missions, how it' organized, and the roles you can play in accomplishing ve s s them.
In the next lesson, we' be looking at some of the things you need to know in order to participate in CAP ll activities, specifically the right way to wear CAP uniforms.

Local Uniform Requirements CAP members wear uniforms for many reasons: to show that they belong to the Auxiliary of the US Air Force, to show that they are part of a team, to signify that they are authorized to be at an activity or event, and to be allowed to travel aboard CAP and military aircraft, etc.
This lesson will show you the different types of uniforms you may wear, as well as the guidelines for wearing them.
16 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 Importance of Grooming and Uniform Standards CAP Grooming Standards When wearing the CAP Air Force-style uniform, you must follow some very strict grooming guidelines.
For instance, your hair may not exceed a certain length, and you are prohibited from wearing beards or excessive jewelry.
Cadets under the age of 18 may exceed weight standards and wear the Air Force-style uniform.
They may not be outside of grooming standards however.
Cadets ages 18 and above who do not meet weight or grooming standards must wear an alternative CAP uniform (blazer combination, blue jump suit, or BDUs without grade).
Grooming and Uniform Standards CAP Grooming Standards Air Force Military Style Uniform Must meet CAP weight standards Must meet AF grooming standards CAP Uniform Standards To find out more about CAP grooming standards, you need to reference (1)_______________, the (2)_________________________.
CAP Uniform Standards Just as there are grooming and weight standards, CAP also has standards for uniform wear.
Here are just a few general guidelines: Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Uniforms need to be neat, clean, current, and in good condition.
Uniforms must be snapped, buttoned, or zippered.
Uniforms must be worn in the right combinations.
Shoes must be kept shined and in good repair.
Metallic badges, insignia, buttons, and other devices must also be maintained in the proper luster and condition.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Uniforms must have the proper fit, according to CAPM 39-1.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jewelry, religious devices, and other accessories must be worn in accordance with CAPM 39-1.
CAP Uniform Combinations CAP Uniform Combinations Let' look at some of the different types of CAP uniforms that you can wear.
s Of course, your unit will dictate which uniforms will be worn.
Your commander will bear in mind the cost for these uniforms when selecting the proper uniforms for you to wear.
Take out your handout on uniforms and follow along.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ CAP Blazer Combination Blue Shirt Combination Service Dress AF Flight Suit CAP Jump Suit BDUs The CAP Blazer Combination (not shown) may be worn any season of the year, and many members choose to wear this uniform instead of the Air Force-style uniforms because they do not meet weight or grooming standards.
Cadets may also wear this uniform on occasion.
It consists of a navy blazer, white shirt - collared or turtleneck, choice of tie, gray slacks or skirt, black hose and shoes.
There are special insignia for wear with this uniform.
Cadets will not wear grade with this uniform.
CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 17 The Blue Shirt Combination is the same uniform worn by military personnel and is the basic CAP cadet uniform.
CAP cadets may wear this uniform when engaged in normal duties as a member and/or while attending local, area, or national CAP functions.
Members may also wear this uniform when traveling to/from CAP activities.
The Service Dress may be worn for ceremonies, parades, reviews, official visits, change of command, or when authorized by appropriate authority.
It' an (3)__________________ uniform, so weight and grooming s standards apply.
The Air Force Flight Suit may be worn while performing flight or authorized recreational activities.
Your commander will tell you if and when you may wear the flight suit.
The CAP Jump Suit (not shown) is an optional uniform which may be worn during flight activities or as a utility uniform.
It may be authorized for wear by the commander for a variety of activities and may be worn by members who do not meet weight and grooming standards.
Finally, there is The Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) .
BDUs are considered work utility uniforms and may be worn at the local unit, special activity, or mission site.
BDUs may not be worn to off-base establishments to do extended shopping, dining, socializing, or take part in any entertainment.
BDUs are considered an Air Forcestyle uniform.
However, cadets over the age of 18 who do not meet weight and grooming standards may wear this uniform without grade insignia.
When and Where to Wear CAP Uniforms Cadets may wear the CAP uniform when engaged in (4)__________ duties as CAP members.
In certain conditions, the uniform may be worn on (5)_____________ or (6)______________ or when visiting military installations.
They are also appropriate when attending (7)__________ or certain (8)___________ functions when representing CAP.
The CAP uniform should not be worn more than 1 hour (9)______________________________, or when participating in a demonstration not approved by the Air Force.
It must not be worn when engaged in (10)________________________ or developing a private or commercial interest.
It may not be worn to any demonstration or activity by a group that advocates violence against the government or other groups, or that engage in illegal activities.
Finally, CAP uniforms may not be worn to foreign countries except in authorized exchange programs, and the uniform must be chosen by the appropriate authority.
Civil Air Patrol Decorations, Ribbons, and Badges Specifics for wear of decorations, ribbons, or badges and insignia on CAP uniforms are outlined in CAPM 39-1 and CAPM 39-3.
Generally, you may only wear the badges, ribbons, and insignia for which you are authorized and only on the uniform combinations authorized.
The frame to the right outlines the order of precedence for CAP ribbon wear.

While we can' cover all you need to know in just this lesson, we can t give you a good start and tell you where to look as you need to learn more about these subjects.
Grade Structures of Civil Air Patrol Because of its auxiliary status with the US Air Force, CAP has adopted a grade structure similar to the Air Force' A person' grade is a symbol of their dedication, skill, knowledge, and performance in CAP.
As s. s your time and experience in CAP increase, so does the opportunity to advance in grade and assume higher levels of responsibility and authority.
Below are tables which name the different grades CAP members can typically hold and which members generally can hold.
You will see what senior member grade looks like in 48 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 Section 5 of the video.
But especially important, you will find out what cadet grade looks like in the back of this section.

Different countries have many ways to salute, but the intent is the same - to recognize fellow members.
As a CAP cadet, in uniform, you must learn to salute properly.
First you' learn how to salute ; after, we' tell you when to render the salute. ll ll Don' worry, there will be people to help show you how. t SALUTE EVALUATION Ã¯Â¿Â½ Raise right hand smartly along the buttons of the jacket or shirt Ã¯Â¿Â½ Extend and join the forefingers Ã¯Â¿Â½ Place the thumb along the forefingers Ã¯Â¿Â½ Keep the palm flat Ã¯Â¿Â½ Face the palm toward the body Ã¯Â¿Â½ Tilt the palm slightly towards the face Ã¯Â¿Â½ Hold the upper arm horizontal, slightly forward of the body and parallel to the ground Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ensure the tip of the middle finger touches the outside corner of the right eyebrow or the front corner of the glasses Ã¯Â¿Â½ Keep the rest of the body at attention Ã¯Â¿Â½ To lower the salute, bring the arm smoothly and smartly downward retracing the same path Ã¯Â¿Â½ Return to the position of attention 50 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 When in the military-style uniform, you should salute the (9)_______________________, Medal of Honor recipients, officers and warrant officers of the US and foreign nations who are (10)____________in rank.

Normally, the only times you salute indoors are when you are reporting to a superior officer or are participating as a member of a color guard.

The cadet program leadership portion helps you to develop these skills by also using self-study and activities.
You' receive a series of books titled Leadership 2000 and Beyond in your packet.
This 15-chapter ll series (one for each achievement) teaches you about leadership, management, and other topics.
You' also receive ll a drill and ceremonies manual.
Drill and ceremonies are very important to the cadet program.
Through drill you will learn to be part of a team, and eventually you' learn to lead through drill.
Many cadets feel that drill is one of CAP' most enjoyable ll s activities, and form drill teams which compete all over the country.
The best teams compete at the national level at the end of every year.
Physical Fitness In order to participate in many CAP activities, you must have both physical and mental stamina.
In other words, you must be active and have enough strength to participate in the activities.
The CAP Physical Fitness Program is designed to help you gain the necessary stamina to participate in CAP activities, and help you create a healthy lifestyle.
As you progress through each achievement, you will be expected to show how much you have improved.
The exercises CAP uses to test you are: the mile run, sit-ups, and sit-and-reach (a flexibility test).
Four Phases of the Cadet Program Phase Phase Phase Phase I II III IV The The The The Beginning Phase Learning Phase Leadership Phase Executive Phase Components of the Cadet Program Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Aerospace Education Leadership Physical Fitness Moral Leadership CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 55 Moral Leadership Finally, there is the moral leadership component.
This time is spent talking about individual beliefs in a group environment.
Morals are basically a person' beliefs about right and wrong.
The purpose of these discussions is s not to tell you how to think, no one will judge on what you believe.
Moral leadership strives to have you examine your own values while looking at current issues and events in society.
How the Four Phases Work As we' said, the cadet program is split into four phases.
As ve you progress, you will be given more responsibility and authority.
When you complete Phases II, III, and IV, you will test for special awards that will give you benefits inside and outside of CAP.
Phase I Four Phases of the Cadet Program Phase I Phase II Phase III Phase IV The Beginning Phase The Learning Phase Mitchell Award The Leadership Phase Earhart Award The Executive Phase Eaker Award Spaatz Award The first phase of the cadet program is called the (5)________________________.
It consists of the first achievement and begins when you actually join CAP.
You are in Phase I right now.
In this phase, you must become familiar with and follow basic uniform standards and basic customs and (6)____________.
You will complete Phase I when you successfully pass the leadership and physical fitness tests and participate in the required moral leadership discussion for Achievement 1.
Phase II Phase II of the cadet program is called the (7)_____________ _____________, and is comprised of Achievements 2 - 7.
In Phase II you begin to learn more about the aerospace world as you study the book (8)______________________.
As you progress, you will begin to take on leadership and staff roles within your unit.
You will also be required to attend a CAP encampment during this phase.
The CAP encampment is a requirement for Phase II completion and is designed to give cadets like yourself a chance to apply the training you have received in a military-style environment.
It also gives you an intense orientation to CAP and Air Force missions and capabilities.
Many cadets consider the CAP encampments among their fondest experiences and return year after year.
When you complete the CAP encampment, you will be eligible to attend a variety of national activities that we' describe a little later.
ll Phase II (Mitchell Award) Achievements 2 - 7 Aerospace Education Leadership Physical Fitness Moral Leadership Encampment CAP Encampment Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ Aerospace Education Leadership Relationship Between CAP and USAF Physical Fitness CAP Missions After you complete Achievement 7 and a CAP encampment, you may take the General Billy Mitchell Award Examination.
It' named after Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, a career Army officer and advocate of a separate s Air Force.
When you pass this test, you' move on to Phase III, be able to apply for a variety of scholarships, and ll share what you' learned with other cadets. ve 56 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 Phase III Phase III is called the (9)_________________________.
This is where you really begin to use your new skills.
You will now be a cadet officer and will assume responsible roles in your unit.
Phase III (Earhart Award) Achievements 8 - 11 Leadership Staff Duty Analysis Physical Fitness Moral Leadership New to your training is Staff Duty Analysis (SDA).
In this program, you will begin to learn about the different staff positions within your unit.
You' learn about a new squadron staff ll position in each achievement and will be expected to perform some of the duties in each position.
It will really open your eyes to see how the squadron works.
When you complete Achievement 11, you can then test for the Amelia (10)___________ Award, named after the famed aviation pioneer who was lost while attempting to be the first female pilot to fly around the world.
When you pass, you' move on to Phase IV, assume even more challenging roles, and have a chance to take part in even ll more activities.
Phase IV The final phase of the cadet program is called the (11)__________ _____________.
Phase IV encompasses achievements 12 -15 and is where you hone the skills you' learned.
You' continue with ve ll (12)__________, SDA, physical fitness, and (13)______________.
Many of you will become cadet commanders of your units or be in charge during activities.
Phase IV (Eaker Award) Achievements 12 - 15 Leadership Staff Duty Analysis Physical Fitness Moral Leadership Spaatz Award When you complete Achievement 15, you will receive the General Ira C. Eaker Award, named after a career Army Air Force officer and key architect of the US Air Force.
You can then test for the most prestigious award in the cadet program, the General Carl A. Spaatz Award.
The Spaatz Award is named after the first Chief of Staff of the US Air Force and the first Chairman of the CAP National Board.
If you receive it, you will have achieved the highest honor for cadet achievement in CAP.
Relationship Between Training and Advancement You may see some cadets wearing what looks like stripes on their shirt or what looks like circles or diamonds on their shoulders.
This is the grade insignia we were referring to earlier.
Grade is simply a symbol of the level of advancement a cadet has achieved within the cadet program.
CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 57 Cadets receive grade commensurate with their level of achievement in the cadet program.
A cadet progresses through the enlisted grades of the cadet program in Phases I and II.
When they receive their Mitchell, they become cadet officers and progress through the cadet officer grade structure.
Cadets may not be promoted to a (14)_______ higher than the one authorized for the achievement.
Promotion to a higher grade shows the members around you that you are ready to take on more responsibility.
Normally, achievements cannot be completed in less than 2month intervals.
This means that cadets may not be normally promoted faster than once every 2 months.
It ensures that the cadets have enough time to absorb and use what they' ve learned.
Certain cadets enrolled in JROTC programs, however, may complete certain achievements at a slightly faster rate, depending on their length of JROTC service.
If you are enrolled in JROTC, see your squadron commander to see if you qualify.
Responsibilities to the Unit and Cadet Program What are your responsibilities to your unit and to the cadet program? Membership in CAP is a (15)_________ reserved for those who want to promote the goals and purposes of CAP.
As a CAP cadet you are required to pay annual membership dues, regularly attend meetings, receive good grades in school, meet training requirements, and participate in CAPM 39-2.
Cadet Grade Phase I Cadet Basic Phase II Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet Cadet First Class Sergeant Staff Sergeant Technical Sergeant Master Sergeant Phase III Cadet Flight Officer Cadet Second Lieutenant Cadet First Lieutenant Phase IV Cadet Captain Cadet Major Cadet Lieutenant Colonel Spaatz Award Cadet Colonel CAP Cadet Responsibilities Ã¯Â¿Â½ Membership is a privilege Ã¯Â¿Â½ Membership requirements Ã¯Â¿Â½ Membership termination unit activities.
Specific requirements are shown in Because CAP membership is a privilege, you may be removed from the cadet program under certain conditions.
You may be removed for cause for incidences involving non-performance, misconduct, or inappropriate behavior.
Instances such as these are rare.
You may also be asked to leave the cadet program if you join the active duty military, marry, or become pregnant.
Fortunately though, you won' be asked to leave CAP.
You will be asked to transfer to senior member status and t enter their training program.
Civil Air Patrol Policy on Cadet Protection and Hazing CAP has instituted the Cadet Protection Policy and the policy on hazing for your protection.
These policies are designed to screen members who have had histories of criminal behavior against children and define acceptable forms of corrective behavior within the cadet program.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Cadet Protection Policy Ã¯Â¿Â½ CAP Policy on Hazing 58 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 Cadet Protection Policy The Cadet Protection Policy is a system designed to screen out adult members who have had histories of (16)______________ behavior involving children and to describe CAP' policies to protect children from sexual s abuse while attending CAP activities.
Adults who wish to become senior members must be fingerprinted and checked by the FBI before they can work with you.
They must also take special training to learn about child abuse, how they can prevent it, and what to do if they learn of it happening.
If a senior member fails to complete either one of these requirements, they will not be allowed to work with you.
The policy also says that if someone suspects that a cadet is being hurt, it will be reported and the cadet will be protected.
Let us assure you though, that instances of such behavior are very rare, and CAP takes these actions to prevent abuse from happening.
Finally, it also educates parents on CAP' policy through a booklet called The s Cadet Protection Policy and Program for Parents and Leaders.
You will receive this booklet in your membership packet; when you do, please give it to your parents.
CAP Policy on Hazing CAP also prohibits members from (17)_______________ other members.
The term implies any behavior which singles out a member for harassment or inappropriate punishment.
It also means that members may not be punished for being pushed beyond their limits or that no corrective action is given to a member which is so harsh that it injures the member.
The Core Values of the US Air Force and Civil Air Patrol As we' said before, instances of inappropriate behavior within CAP are rare.
Part of the reason is that US Air ve Force and CAP follow some basic ethical principles called "Core Values."
Core values apply to all CAP members and provide guidelines for acceptable behavior.
Air Force Core Values First we' look at Air Force Core Values.
Each (18)___________ ll _________ represents a part of our character which helps us do the right thing.
It' the voice in the back of our head that tells us what' s s right and wrong.
(19)____________ means the ability to be honest to others and oneself.
It means standing up in the face of peer pressure and doing what' right.
s It also means not covering up for someone else when what they are doing is wrong.
Air Force Core Values Integrity First Service Before Self Excellence in All We Do (20)____________________________ means to put your personal wants aside for something that is bigger.
It means that you do what you' promised, you think about what' better for your fellow cadets and for CAP.
Taken ve s outside of CAP, it means doing what is right for your family, school, or job.
It means to remember your responsibilities.
(21)_____________________________ means that you do the best you can, no matter what it may be.
You may not be the best at something, but you always try.
It means that you try to get it right the first time, if for no one else but yourself.
It feels good when you know you' given everything you can.
ve CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 59 CAP Core Values CAP has seven core values which reflect the (22)_______________ core values.
In addition to the core values of Integrity, Excellence, and Service Before Self (Volunteerism), CAP adds the core values of (23)________ - it' s the foundation of everything we do in CAP, (24)_____________ - knowing that all members will come through, (25)_____________ - for ourselves and our fellow members, and finally (26)________, the reason why you joined CAP in the first place.
These core values are at the very heart of what we do and reflect the many years of our public service to America.
Member Benefits Most people who join a volunteer organization do so for many reasons.
Mostly, its a mix of wanting to do something for their community while wanting to do something fun for themselves.
Many cadets like you, for instance, want to fly or join the military.
You also want to help the community, which is why most cadets like yourself participate in the emergency services missions.
Whatever the reason, CAP provides you with many (27)___________ which you can enjoy both while you still are a cadet and when you move on, possibly to senior membership, or other activities which you find rewarding.

Not everyone can wear the CAP uniform; it is a (30)___________ _ which goes hand in hand with CAP membership.
Awards recognize achievement of performance.
As you complete achievements in the cadet program, you receive the (31)___________, (32)_____________, (33)____________, and (34)__________ awards.
But there are also many other types of awards you can receive for service and good performance.
These awards are tied to service in the CAP missions, time in CAP, and outstanding contributions to CAP.
Orientation flights expose you to the different forces of flight, navigation, and communications techniques.
It makes the lessons you read in your aerospace book come alive! You can take up to nine orientation flights in CAP or military aircraft.
Model rocketry is also a fun way to better understand what you read in your (35)______________ book.
In CAP, you can build and launch model rockets of all types.
They range from simple to build, small rockets which can be launched easily to more complicated rockets that reach thousands of feet into the air! Many CAP wings have competitions to see which rockets are the best looking and highest flying! 60 CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 Would you like to fly? Flight training has been one of CAP' primary objectives since it was listed in the s (36)______________________.
CAP gives you many ways to learn to fly.
CAP offers flight scholarships ranging from $150 - $2,100 if you qualify.
You can also attend the National Flight Academy - CAP' flagship flight s activity.
This network of flight encampments across the country will teach you the basics of powered or sail plane flight - you may even solo! In addition, there are many encampments run by CAP wings and regions; chances are you can learn to fly close to home.

Frankly, there just isn' enough time in this course to tell about all the benefits you can get as a CAP cadet.
As you t have more questions, you can talk to your instructor or commander.
You can also find out by looking in the CAP manuals and regulations.
CAPP 50-9 Volume 2 61 CAP Publications and Indexes During this course, we have made many references to CAP manuals and publications.
As you progress in the cadet program, you will find you' frequently reference these publications to answer questions or to study your ll (47)______________________________.
You can find copies of CAP publications at the squadron; just ask your administrative officer if you can look at them.
As you can see, CAP regulations cover many different subjects.
For now though, you just need to remember that the Cadet Training Program is covered in CAP Manual 50- 16, and uniform wear is covered in CAP Manual 39-1.
