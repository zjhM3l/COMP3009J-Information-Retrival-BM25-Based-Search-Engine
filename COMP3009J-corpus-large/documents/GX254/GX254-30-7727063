Appendix G Â­ Arizona Chronology* Paleoindian Period 11,500 BC Â­ 5,000 BC Earliest known human occupation of North America, Paleoindians were small (20-30 individuals), nomadic groups which, utilizing distinctive Clovis technology, hunted mammoth and other megafauna.
Many of the large game animals became extinct before the later phases of the Paleoindian Period (Folsom, Plano), although exploitation of resources such as Bison antiquis continued.
In the Early Archaic, small family groups of hunter-gatherers ranging over large territories, often using caves and rockshelters for base camps.
Greater reliance on plants for food.
Increasingly marginal environmental conditions necessitated improvements in technology.
Use of baskets, milling stones, and a variety of different types of points and ground stone tools.
The introduction of ceramics and horticulture (beans, corn, and squash) from Mesoamerica towards the end of the Archaic contributed to the development of more permanent settlements along the river valleys.
Use of storage pits and other techniques for food preservation.
Considered ancestral to modern Pueblo Indians, the Anasazi culture occupied the Four Corners region, including northeastern Arizona.
Agriculture became an important component of Anasazi culture around 500 AD, and by 700 AD, pit houses were replaced by pueblo architecture.
It is believed that climatic changes and/or social conflict beginning around 900 AD caused the Anasazi to abandon their settlements by 1300 AD. Predominant in south-central Arizona.
Increased importance of agriculture and a settled lifestyle; advanced irrigation techniques.
Settlement patterns became more sophisticated over time: early pithouse clusters gave way to rock and adobe construction in the Classic Period.
Settlements also exhibited similarities to Mesoamerican sites, with courtyard spaces and ceremonial ball courts.
The ruins of Casa Grande, a four-story structure build in the mid1300s with apparent ceremonial/astronomical significance reflect the sophistication of the Hohokam Classic Period.
Centered in southern New Mexico and West Texas (Rio Grande Valley), the Mogollon culture also extended into southeastern Arizona, and was generally contemporary with the Hohokam.
Transition from pithouse to pueblo-style villages of up to 100 dwellings surrounding central plazas.
Characteristic black-on-white pottery during the Mimbres Classic period.
The abandonment of the Mimbres region occurred after AD 1300, although cultural elements are found as far west as the Salado Region (Tonto Basin).
The Salado Indians occupied the Tonto Basin area, generally in the region between the middle Salt River and Tonto Creek, and in the rugged upper Sonoran Desert near the edge of the Mollogon Rim.
The Salado practiced simple irrigation of crops (corn and beans) and utilized native plants such as yucca and agave.
Food was stored in large beehive shaped granaries made of baskets lined with adobe and placed on low rock pedestals.
Polychrome pottery made from red clay is characteristic of the Salado.
Structures were typically cobble and adobe (similar to Hohokam masonry) and were organized into protected compounds around a central plaza.
Platform mounds (ex. Cline Terrace Mound) began to be constructed around 1280 AD.
The Salado abandoned these villages for cliff dwellings during the late 1300s, ultimately abandoning the Tonto Basin by 1450 AD. Considered descendants of the Hohokam, the Piman occupy the Sonoran desert.
They are agriculturalists, utilizing irrigation canals along the Gila and Salt Rivers and cultivating corn, beans and squash.
Characteristic coiled basketry.
Nomadic hunters and warriors, the Apache, a southern branch of the Athabascan linguistic stock, began moving into the southeastern portion of present-day Arizona in the mid-1500s as a result of pressures from Comanches in Texas and New Mexico.
In 1539 the Spanish explorer Fray Marcos de Niza traveled through Arizona, followed by a larger expedition under Coronado a year later.
Settlement by the Spanish brought disease (smallpox in 1520 and measles in 1729) and general disruption and decline to the native populations.
Establishment of numerous forts (presidios) and missions.
Spanish rule was followed by incorporation of the area into the Mexican Republic after 1824.
The loss of most of Northern Mexico (including present-day Arizona) to the United States during the Mexican-American War (18461848) and the subsequent Gadsden Purchase in 1854, encompassing southern Arizona and the southernmost portion of New Mexico, marked the end of Hispanic control.
After the Mexican-American War, present-day Arizona was included in the New Mexico territory.
In August 1861 the Territory of Arizona was created and seceded from the Union; in 1863, the United States Government recognized the Territory of Arizona and established the present boundaries.
Influx of Anglo-American settlers from 1865 to 1900.
Arizona attained statehood in 1912.

Appendix G Â­ Selected Cultural Resources Localities on BLM-Managed Lands Field Office AZ Strip Locality Paria Canyon and Paria Plateau Type Prehistoric Description Large variety of sites including pithouses, masonry features, habitation structures, granaries, storage cists, hearths, lithic scatters, campsites, rock art, rock shelters, and trails.
The Paria Plateau Archeological District (constituting 70,000 acres and 416 sites) was determined eligible for the NRHP in 1976.
Pinyon-juniper woodland with water sources at mesa footlands.
High potential for prehistoric sites.
Rock shelters, masonry features, and rock art in the vicinity of Lost Spring Mountain.
The Mount Trumbull Archeological District (18,250 acres and 72 sites) was determined eligible for the NRHP in 1976.
The area was occupied by 2600 BC, based on split twig figurines found in canyon rockshelters, and by 1 AD, the fertile soils of the area were being exploited by the Anasazi, who established habitation sites in the area.
Evidence of Paiute occupation has been noted from ceramics associated with Anasazi pueblo sites.
Two significant rock art sites are Witch Pool and Nampaweap, a half-mile long site with thousands of rock art elements.
Antelope Cave, an Anasazi Village site on the Uinkaret Plateau was listed on the NRHP in 1975.
High density of prehistoric sites including the petroglyph site at Little Black Mountain (over 500 designs), and seasonal campsite locations in the vicinity of the Virgin and Beaver Dam Mountains.
Habitation sites and campsites are likely in the Wolf Hole, Black Rock, and Poverty Mountains, and medium density hunting/gathering sites are predicted on the benches of the Shivwits and Sanup Plateaus.
Seasonal hunting and gathering sites are predicted in the Grand Wash areas.
High densities of sites in the canyon floors leading to the Grand Canyon, where flood zones would suggest agricultural development are also predicted.
Historic overland trade route from New Mexico to California, established ca. 1829 by Antonio Armijo, a New Mexico trader.
Extends from St. George, Utah to sawmill sites on Mt. Trumbull.
The sawmills and trail were established in 1872 by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
