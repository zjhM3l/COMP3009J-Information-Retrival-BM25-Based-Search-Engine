Abstract The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is proposing to implement an integrated pest management (IPM) program at Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards.
In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, BLM has prepared this environmental impact statement (EIS), which assesses three action alternatives and the no action alternative: Â· Alternative A -- Maximum Production IPM.
Pests would be managed using all identified biological, chemical, prescribed fire, cultural, and other pest control methods.
Alternative B--IPM with Environmental Protection Emphasis (Proposed Action).
Pests would be managed using all of the methods in Alternative A, with limitations designed to protect worker health and safety and the environment.
The limitations are based on the conclusions of a recent risk assessment, scoping comments, and recommendations from BLM interdisciplinary team members.
Alternative C--Non-Chemical Pest Management.
Pests would be managed using only the biological, prescribed fire, cultural, and other methods listed under Alternative A.
No chemical pesticide methods would be permitted.
Alternative D--No Action: Continuation of Current Management Approach.
The current management system uses all non-chemical-pesticide pest control practices at the seed orchards, as well as chemical pesticides on a case-by-case basis.
All biological, prescribed fire, cultural, and other methods would be used in accordance with current procedures.
When a specific need is identified for a chemical pesticide, the action would be reviewed to determine whether it is encompassed by an existing NEPA document, or whether an environmental assessment or EIS is required.
Â·
Â·
Â·
Alternative B, the proposed action, is the preferred alternative of BLM.
Resources analyzed in the EIS include air quality, geology, water, land use, human health and safety, biological resources, noise, cultural resources, and socioeconomics and environmental justice.
The EIS also assesses the potential cumulative effects of implementing the IPM program along with other actions occurring concurrently at Provolt and Sprague and in the respective surrounding areas.
The recently conducted risk assessment is included in the supporting record and summarized in an appendix.
Executive Summary
Executive Summary The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to implement an integrated pest management (IPM) program at the Provolt Seed Orchard in Josephine and Jackson Counties, Oregon, and the Sprague Seed Orchard in Josephine County, Oregon.
Both orchards are within BLM's Medford District.
In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, which requires Federal agencies to consider environmental consequences in their decision-making process, this draft environmental impact statement (EIS) identifies potential environmental impacts from each alternative considered.
This EIS must be prepared before BLM makes final decisions regarding the selection of an alternative, and be available to inform decision makers and the public of potential environmental consequences of the proposed action or an alternative.
Distribution and review of this Draft EIS allows for public consideration and input concerning the proposed IPM program.
After carefully considering comments on this Draft EIS, BLM will issue a Final EIS.
After completing the Final EIS, BLM will publicly state which action will be implemented in a formal document called a Record of Decision (ROD).
Subsequent IPM activities will be implemented over the life of the IPM plan (usually 15 to 20 years) in accordance with that decision.
BLM will use the analyses presented in this EIS to decide how to continue operations at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards in a manner consistent with human health and safety considerations and existing environmental protection laws, while maintaining adequate seed and seedling production.
Maintaining adequate production includes the implementation of an IPM approach to manage vegetation, insects, disease, and animal pests at the seed orchard.
The ROD to be issued on the basis of this EIS, by the BLM Medford District Manager, will identify the specific control methods available for use at Provolt and Sprague for controlling insects, disease, vegetation, and animal pests.
No further NEPA documentation relating to IPM should be required before pest management projects are undertaken, unless the seed orchard manager proposes a new IPM product or technology that was not analyzed in this EIS.
Purpose And Need For Action The purpose of the action is to manage competing and unwanted vegetation, diseases, insects, and other animals at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards.
Management of adverse impacts from pests is necessary to allow the seed orchard to produce improved seed for conifer seedling production, preserve valuable individual conifer trees, and produce native species plants (including grass, forb and brush, and other) and seed.
This high-quality seed is supplied to BLM and other cooperators for reforestation and restoration projects.
For many years, Provolt and Sprague have managed pests with very limited use of chemicals: glyphosate was used at Provolt in 2001 and 2002 to spot-treat noxious weeds; and at Sprague, glyphosate was used from 1999 through 2002 to spot-treat noxious weeds, and esfenvalerate was used for control of cone and seed insects in two orchard units annually from 1992 to 1996.
Their use in the orchards has required preparation of two separate NEPA documents (an environmental assessment, or EA) to analyze the potential impacts from use of these chemicals.
Changes and experience with control methods at both orchards have created the need to reevaluate the pest management program to ensure that the pest management objectives at Provolt and Sprague continue to be met.
In addition, the public demand for efficient use of resources in government, as well as for providing appropriate environmental protection, requires the selection and use of the best pest management techniques for efficient and cost-effective orchard operation over the long term.
The pest management objectives at Provolt and Sprague include the following: Â· Minimize insect damage to orchard trees, cone crops, and native plants.
Â· Remove noxious weeds and control vegetation that favors animal pests and disease conditions, and reduce fire hazard conditions.
i
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM Â· Reduce growth of vegetation to allow tree establishment and growth and to minimize damage to orchard equipment and infrastructure.
Â· Treat fungal diseases to maintain the health and vigor of the orchard trees used for seed production, and the health and vigor of the native plant species for seed production.
Â· Minimize animal damage to orchard trees, native plant (grass and forb) beds (at Sprague), and orchard equipment and infrastructure.
The need for action is also demonstrated by the orchard's experience with periodic problems from insects, disease, weeds, and animals.
Pest Management Methods There are many methods available to manage vegetation, insects, disease, and animal pests at Provolt and Sprague.
These methods generally fall into the following categories: biological, chemical, prescribed fire, cultural, and other methods.
The pest management methods that are analyzed under one or more of the alternatives in this EIS are as follows:
Biological Control Methods Â· Insects: bird and bat boxes to attract insect-eating birds and bats, naturally occurring bacteria such as Bacillus thuringiensis (a biological insecticide).
Â· Disease: natural and planted herbaceous vegetation left intact to provide some natural shade to seedlings, thereby reducing stress and potential diseases.
Â· Animal pests: perch poles for birds of prey; barn owl nest box (Provolt); predators including bobcat, coyote, long-tailed weasel, and fox encouraged to populate the seed orchard lands and aid in control of animal pests.
Chemical Pesticide Methods Â· Vegetation: herbicides, including dicamba, glyphosate, hexazinone, picloram, and triclopyr.
Â· Insects: insecticides, including acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, esfenvalerate, horticultural oil, permethrin, propargite, and SaferÂ® soap.
Â· Disease: a fungicide, chlorothalonil.
The methods that may be used to apply these pesticides at Provolt and Sprague are high-pressure hydraulic sprayer, hydraulic sprayer with hand-held wand, tractor-pulled spray rig with boom, backpack sprayer, hand-held wick, capsule implantation, and broadcast spreader.
Note that not all chemicals would be used in a given year, and some might never be used.
However, their analysis in an alternative in this EIS, and subsequent selection of that alternative in the ROD, would give the seed orchard manager the option of using them in the future should a specific need arise.
It is also important to note that each chemical application must first be approved by the Provolt or Sprague seed orchard manager.
All pesticides would be applied in compliance with all Federal and Oregon state laws, BLM regulations and policies, and manufacturer recommendations.
Prescribed Fire Â· Vegetation: control of unwanted vegetation along fence lines, road sides, and irrigation ditches; pile burning of cut/cleared vegetation.
ii
Executive Summary Â· Insects: pile burning of insect damaged branches and trees, burning cones from sanitation collections and insect-damaged cones.
Â· Disease: pile burning of infected branches and trees, burning grass straw in bed rows in the native plant gardens (Sprague).
Cultural Control Methods Â· Vegetation: hand-pulling; pruning; thinning; hand tools to cut and grub; tractors with various blade attachments for mowing; gasoline-powered string trimmers; brush cutter machine mounted on tractor; chainsaw for cutting up thinned, rogued, dead/dying orchard trees; power pruner; wood chipper; chipping with large tub grinders and marketing the chips for energy development; mulch mats.
Â· Insects: pruning, thinning, shaping, use of grafting wax or spray seal on tree wounds, sanitation of damaged branches and trees, sanitation of insect-damaged cones and cones not harvested for seed production, hand-picking large and noticeable insect pupae.
Â· Disease: pruning, power saws to cut infected or dead trees; removal of diseased plants from the native plant gardens using a tractor and roto tiller (Sprague), mesh shade screens to protect seedlings from heat damage, hand-painting older trees with exposed and thin bark to reflect the sun's rays and insulate from extreme heat.
Â· Animal pests: walking (herding) stray deer toward and out the gates; pruning tree limbs up at the base of the trees; removing unwanted vegetation, and mowing cover crop vegetation that would provide cover for small mammals; live trapping; lowering the lake's water level for several days to cause beavers to move out (Sprague); pellet gun to reduce western gray squirrel population (Sprague); screening buildings, under buildings, and inside culverts to act as a barrier against western gray squirrel, skunk, and other animals; wire protection of lower tree stems to prevent beaver damage (Provolt).
Other Methods Â· Pheromone bait traps to attract and capture damaging insects.
Â· Fertilization to promote overall tree health, cone production, and disease resistance.
It is the policy of the Department of Interior, and all of its agencies including BLM, to use chemical pesticides only after considering the alternatives; and to develop, support, and adopt IPM strategies wherever practicable.
The focus of IPM is on long-term prevention or suppression of pests. to pest management incorporates the best-suited biological, chemical, have minimum impact on the environment and on people.
IPM is not however, a successful IPM program should result in the most efficient when they are needed.
The integrated approach and cultural controls that pesticide-free management; use of pesticides if and
Research into better and more effective control methods is also an essential part of an IPM program.
The seed orchard manager would regularly review the pest management methods available for use, including new and developing technologies, to ensure that the seed orchard utilizes the most effective methods of control while minimizing the potential for any adverse environmental or health impacts.
The focus of this EIS is on activities directly relating to implementing an IPM program at the seed orchards.
Other routine management actions Â­ such as establishment and maintenance of orchard units, buffer zone management, and facilities/equipment maintenance Â­ are not directly related to IPM and therefore not evaluated in this EIS.

Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM
Alternatives BLM identified and evaluated four alternatives to address the need for a pest management program at Provolt and Sprague, as follows: Â· Â· Â· Â· Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative A: B: C: D: Maximum Production IPM IPM with Environmental Protection Emphasis (Proposed Action) Non-Chemical Pest Management No Action--Continue Current Management Approach
Alternative B is BLM's preferred alternative.
Each alternative is described in more detail below.
Pest management methods that are common to all alternatives are biological methods, cultural methods, prescribed burning, and other non-chemical-pesticide control methods.
Other activities common to all alternatives include orchard management activities unrelated to pest management and protection measures that would be observed under any alternative.
Protection measures are a list of "best management practices" intended to ensure the proper and safe application of pesticides at Provolt and Sprague and include worker protection measures as well as public, environmental, and ecological protection measures.
Alternative A--Maximum Production IPM Under this alternative, the primary goal is the maximum production of seeds and plants with a very low level of acceptable losses.
Provolt's and Sprague's seed orchard manager would have all identified biological, chemical, prescribed fire, cultural, and other pest control methods available for use.
An effective IPM strategy for all orchard pests would be implemented under this alternative; however, the primary management objective would be to maximize seed production for annual BLM and cooperator seed needs by aggressively controlling cone and seed insects and other limiting factors.
The most effective insect control measures would be implemented, to maximize seed yield and reduce damage to the seed crops with low acceptable seed losses, emphasizing production above other less-effective control methods and considerations, with a low threshold for initiating treatment.
Alternative B--IPM with Environmental Protection Emphasis (Proposed Action) Under this alternative, the seed orchard manager would have access to the full list of pest management methods identified above; however, chemical use would be restricted by a set of limitations.
These limitations address risks predicted by the quantitative risk assessment, respond to scoping concerns, consider the results of previous monitoring, and include recommendations made by the interdisciplinary EIS preparation team.
The limitations provide additional protection to human health and the environment, and distinguish the details of potential treatments under Alternative B from those under Alternative A.
A complete list of limitations is provided in Section 2.3.3.
Alternative C--Non-Chemical Pest Management Alternative C would allow the seed orchard manager to use only the biological, prescribed fire, cultural, and other non-chemical-pesticide methods listed above.
No chemical pesticides would be permitted.
Alternative D--No Action: Continue Current Management Approach Alternative D would allow continuation of the current management system, which is the use of all non-chemical-pesticide control practices at the seed orchard, as well as the use of chemical pesticides on a specific case-by-case basis.
All biological, prescribed fire, cultural, and other iv
Executive Summary non-chemical-pesticide methods would be used as needed.
When a specific need is identified for a chemical pesticide, the action would be reviewed to determine whether it is encompassed by an existing EA or EIS.
This could include applications for controlling cone insects or other orchard insect outbreaks, disease infestations, and any vegetation control necessary that is not covered by other BLM vegetation control NEPA documents.
Alternative Considered But Not Further Analyzed During the scoping process, one member of the public suggested planting more crop trees than necessary to allow for some loss to pests, which was interpreted as a request to consider no pest management at all.
This is not a viable alternative for several reasons.
First, this approach could lead to a significant loss of the crop trees in the production units if disease were to occur.
Secondly, orchard research has shown that approximately 70% of the seed crop could be lost if no pest management were practiced.
To partially offset the effects of cone and seed insects and decreased tree vigor due to disease, it would be necessary to plant production trees in fields that are currently fallow, as the commentor suggested.
This solution would require the seed orchard and their cooperators to accept an estimated 10-year reduction in seed production, which is the time that would be required for the newly planted trees to produce collectable seed.
This decrease in production could also result in delays in reforestation projects caused by potential seed shortages, or reduced forest growth resulting from the use of genetically inferior seed from other sources.
In addition, a more intensive planting regime on seed orchard grounds, with no pest management of any kind, would allow the orchard lands to become a "reservoir" for insects, disease, noxious weeds, and animal pests that would spread to neighboring public and private lands--effectively, becoming a threat and nuisance to the neighbors, particularly those who cultivate crops of their own.
Affected Environment The Provolt Seed Orchard is located approximately 15 miles southeast of the city of Grants Pass and 25 miles west of Medford, Oregon, near the small community of Provolt and within Josephine and Jackson Counties.
It lies within the Applegate River valley of the Klamath Mountains province.
The Provolt Seed Orchard is located in the Rogue Basin at the confluence of the Applegate River and Williams Creek on floodplains and an alluvial terrace.
Sprague is located approximately ten miles northwest of Grants Pass and about 40 miles northwest of Medford.
The Sprague Seed Orchard is located within the Klamath Mountains, on foot slopes and hills in the Rogue River basin in the Jump-off Joe Creek watershed.
Several tributaries to Jump-off Joe Creek flow through the seed orchard.
The orchards' geographical locations between the Pacific Ocean and Cascade Mountains result in a maritime west coast climate, featuring mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.
The EIS includes a detailed discussion of the relevant environment at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards, providing baseline information to allow the evaluation of potential environmental impacts that could result from the proposed action or an alternative action.
The human environment includes natural and physical resources and the relationship of people to those resources.
The resources described in the EIS include, in order of presentation, the physical environment (air, geology, and water), followed by land use, human health, biological resources, and the human environment (noise, cultural resources, socioeconomics, and environmental justice).
These resources are described in a sufficient level of detail to adequately support the impact analysis.
v
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM
Environmental Impacts Chapter 4 of the EIS details the methods of analysis and assumptions made in evaluating potential impacts to each resource.
Approaches included conducting a quantitative human health and ecological (non-target species) risk assessment (summarized in Appendix C), environmental fate and transport modeling, literature review, statistical evaluations, and review of similar actions at other locations.
The resource-specific subsections in Chapter 4 describe the methods and present the criteria used for determining whether there are any potential impacts.
The analysis predicted no significant impacts to air quality, geology and soils, land use, noise, cultural resources, and socioeconomics and environmental justice.
Human health, biological resources, and surface water (as it relates to aquatic species) are the resources with the greatest potential for impact and should receive the greatest attention in decision-making.
Human Health and Safety Â· There are no significant risks to members of the public from the proposed use of any of the control methods under any of the alternatives.
However, under Alternatives A, B, and D, an accidental spill of pesticide to a stream could make surface water unsafe for drinking or fishing.
Â· Under Alternatives A and D, there is a possibility of health effects for workers from some chemical pesticides.
No risks of worker health effects were predicted for pesticide applications under Alternative B. Under Alternatives A, B, and D, an accidental spill onto the skin could cause health risks.
Under all of the alternatives, there is a possibility of injury from cultural or prescribed fire methods.
Water Quality Â· No significant impacts to groundwater quality were predicted under any alternative.
Â· Runoff or drift from pesticide or fertilizer applications could enter streams and rivers under Alternatives A, B, and D; and fertilizers could enter surface water in runoff under Alternative C.
The effects of the estimated stream concentrations on human health and aquatic species are described under those headings.
Under Alternative B, limitations would be in place to control the potential for runoff and drift of pesticides.
Â· An accidental spill of pesticide concentrate or mix could contaminate groundwater or surface water under Alternatives A, B, and D.
A spill of fertilizer could contaminate groundwater or surface water under all alternatives.
Biological Resources Â· No adverse impacts to non-target vegetation are expected under any of the alternatives.
Â· There are possible risks to terrestrial wildlife species from three of the proposed insecticides under Alternatives A and D. Lethality would be expected for non-target insects in an area treated with insecticide under Alternatives A, B, and D.
No significant impacts to terrestrial wildlife were predicted under Alternatives B and C.
Â· There are no significant risks to aquatic species from use of the chemical, biological, prescribed fire, or cultural control methods under any of the alternatives.
Under maximum runoff conditions, fertilizer could cause impacts to special status species in the main tributary to Jumpoff Joe Creek at Sprague; no aquatic species risks from fertilizers were predicted at Provolt.
Under Alternatives A, B, and D, there could be adverse impacts to aquatic species from an accidental spill of pesticide to a stream.
vi
Executive Summary Alternative B is the proposed action, and is BLM's preferred alternative for minimizing long-term impacts to all resources, including human health.
Cumulative Impacts According to CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1508.7, "cumulative impact" is the impact on the environment that results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of what agency or person undertakes such actions.
There are no other major projects proposed in the orchard vicinity that are longterm in nature or would result in significant changes in the physical characteristics of the project area.
Another cumulative concern relates to the potential toxic effects of exposure to multiple chemicals.
The human health risk assessment addressed cumulative risk to workers and the public from the subset of proposed chemicals that are more likely than others to be used in a given year.
No risk was identified for members of the public, but risk was identified for some workers under Alternative A when very conservative assumptions were applied to avoid underestimating the potential impact.
Mitigation Measures Based on the results of the quantitative risk assessment, the selection of Alternative A, Maximum Production IPM, could result in adverse impacts to human health and ecological resources.
Therefore, CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA require that potential mitigation measures be identified in this EIS.
The identified mitigation measures, described in detail in Section 4.12, restrict rates, frequencies, and other use details for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, dicamba, hexazinone, permethrin, propargite, and fertilizers.
The design of Alternative B, IPM with Environmental Protection Emphasis, includes the limitations specified in Section 2.3.3, and is expected to address all identified potential risks, with the exception of possible maximum scenario risks from fertilizers at Sprague.
These risks are only predicted for conditions in which soils are saturated and then a large storm event follows application, which is a situation with a very low probability of occurrence, representing the upper bound of the risk range estimated in the risk assessment.
The only significant impacts associated with Alternative C, Non-Chemical Pest Management, are those from maximum scenario fertilization, as described in the preceding paragraph.
No additional mitigation is identified for this risk.
Mitigation measures for use of chemical pesticides under Alternative D, No Action, would be identified on a project-by-project basis during the specific NEPA assessments.
The ROD that will be published at the conclusion of the EIS process will specify the mitigation measures that will be implemented with the selected alternative.

Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM
xiv
Chapter 1 -- Introduction
1.0 Introduction The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to implement an integrated pest management (IPM) program at the Provolt Seed Orchard in Josephine and Jackson Counties, Oregon, and the Sprague Seed Orchard in Josephine County, Oregon.
Both orchards are within BLM's Medford District.
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, requires Federal agencies to consider environmental consequences in their decision-making process.
The President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has issued regulations to implement NEPA that include provisions for both the content and procedural aspects of the required environmental analysis (40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1500 et seq.).
The environmental impact analysis process, as governed by the Department of the Interior 's Departmental Manual 516, NEPA Compliance, and BLM's Manual H-1790-1, National Environmental Policy Act Handbook, is the mechanism by which BLM ensures its decisions are based on an understanding of potential environmental consequences.
The CEQ regulations were used in conjunction with the Departmental and Bureau guidance to determine the appropriate level of environmental analysis for this action, which BLM has determined to be an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
Preparation of this EIS must precede final decisions regarding the selection of an alternative, and be available to inform decision makers and the public of potential environmental consequences.
Distribution and review of this Draft EIS allows for public consideration and input concerning the proposed IPM program, and will provide to decision makers and the public the information required to understand the future environmental consequences of the proposed action or an alternative.
After carefully considering comments on this Draft EIS, BLM will issue a Final EIS.
After completing the Final EIS, BLM will publicly state which action will be implemented in a formal document called a Record of Decision (ROD).
Subsequent IPM activities would be implemented over the life of the IPM plan (usually 15 to 20 years) in accordance with that decision.
No further NEPA documentation relating to IPM would be required, unless the seed orchard manager proposes to use a new IPM product or technology that was not included in the alternative selected in the ROD.
The NEPA review requirements in this situation are discussed in Section 2.4.4.
This introductory chapter identifies the purpose and need for action, provides a general description of the location of the seed orchards, summarizes scoping comments and issues, and discusses the relationship of this document to other plans, policies, and programs.
It concludes by describing the organization of the remainder of this EIS.
1.1 Purpose And Need For Action 1.1.1 Purpose The purpose of the action is to manage competing and unwanted vegetation, diseases, insects, and animal pests at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards.
Management of adverse impacts from pests is necessary to allow the seed orchards to produce improved seed for conifer seedling production, preserve valuable individual conifer trees, and produce native species plants and seed (including grass, forb, brush, and other).
This high-quality seed is supplied to BLM and other cooperators for reforestation and restoration projects.
For many years, Provolt has managed pests using an IPM program that included a very limited use of chemicals: glyphosate (RodeoÂ®) was used in 2001 and 2002 to spot-treat noxious weeds.
At Sprague, very limited use has also been made of chemicals: glyphosate (RodeoÂ®) was used from 1999 through 2002 to spot-treat noxious weeds, and esfenvalerate was used for control of cone and seed insects annually from 1992 to 1996 in two orchard units.
Both the glyphosate and esfenvalerate uses were addressed in two separate environmental assessments (EAs) (BLM 1992a; BLM 1998).
Changes and experience with control methods at the seed orchards have created the Chapter 1 -- 1
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM need to re-evaluate the pest management program to ensure that the pest management objectives at Provolt and Sprague continue to be met.
In addition, the public demand for efficient use of resources in government, as well as for providing appropriate environmental protection, requires the selection and use of the best pest management techniques for efficient and cost-effective orchard operation over the long term.
The pest management objectives at Provolt and Sprague include the following: Â· Minimize insect damage to orchard trees, cone crops, and native plants.
Â· Remove noxious weeds and control vegetation that favors animal pests and disease conditions, and reduce fire hazard conditions.
Â· Reduce growth of vegetation to allow tree establishment and growth, and to minimize damage to orchard equipment and infrastructure.
Â· Treat fungal diseases to maintain the health and vigor of the orchard trees used for seed production, and the native plant species (at Sprague) for seed production.
Also, to control plant pathogens in the native seedling grow-out beds.
Â· Minimize animal damage to orchard trees, native plant beds (at Sprague), and orchard equipment and infrastructure.
1.1.2 Need for Action The need for action is demonstrated by both orchards' experience with periodic problems from insects, disease, weeds, and animals.
These pests are described in the following paragraphs.
Appendix A contains detailed information on the more common and damaging insects and diseases at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards.
1.1.2.1 Insects The seed orchards' locations are somewhat isolated from natural stands of orchard tree species, which probably helps reduce the natural load of insects specific to the species.
However, many insects known and capable of causing serious injury to Douglas-fir at Provolt and pine species at Sprague are present in the lands near the orchards.
These are adult flying insects, capable of reaching orchard lands from outlying mountain areas.
At Provolt, insects which cause damage to Douglas-fir cones on the trees in the orchard, are the Douglas-fir cone worm (Dioryctria abietivorella), Douglas-fir cone moth (Barbara colfaxiana), Douglas-fir cone gall midge (Contarinia oregonensis), western conifer seed bug (Leptoglosses occidentalis), and the Douglas-fir seed chalcid (Megastigmus spermotrophus).
All of these insects cause varying amounts of damage but the cone worm is the most significant.
The Provolt Seed Orchard was used in a gall midge study in 2000 and 2001 by Simon Fraser University (British Columbia, Canada) researchers to test pheromones.
Part of the study revealed the presence of Douglas-fir cone gall midge in the orchard and some limited damage to cones and seeds.
Douglasfir twig weevil (Cylindrocopturus furnissi) also can be problem.
Bark beetles and boring insects such as the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae), Douglas-fir engraver beetle (Scolytus unispinosus), fir engraver beetle (Scolytus ventralis), and the flat headed borer (Melanophila drummondi) will tunnel through the outer stem bark into living tissue of stressed trees and sometimes healthy trees, and introduce fungi which cause damage and mortality.
Infected trees are removed quickly from the orchard.
At Sprague, potentially damaging insects include the fir cone worm (Dioryctria abietivorella), western conifer seed bug (Leptoglossus occidentalis), a species of cone borer (Eucosma spp.), and the sugar pine cone beetle (Conophthorus lambertiana).
The cone beetle is a serious conedamaging insect to sugar pines in the forests of southern Oregon, but as yet has been seldom found in the orchard.
Bark beetles and boring insects such as the red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus Chapter 1 -- 2
Chapter 1 -- Introduction valens) and mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) will tunnel through the outer stem bark into living tissue of stressed trees and sometimes healthy trees, and introduce fungi which cause damage and mortality.
Infected trees are removed quickly from the orchard.
Most types of detrimental insects have caused limited amounts of tree damage, including stress; deformation of tree stem, roots, branches, needles, or buds; damage to pollen, cones, and seeds; and mortality.
Generally, the adult insects lay eggs on trees.
The larval stages of these insects then tunnel into tree parts and eat tissue, destroying or deforming the tree parts, or the adult insect will bore into seeds to remove the contents.
Larvae will often form pupae in or on the tree parts, such as in the bark or cones, and overwinter until the following spring when they emerge as adults, thus completing the life cycle.
Healthy, vigorous trees are able to withstand occasional or limited attacks of foliar, bark, or root insects and recover with little damage.
However, large numbers of cone and seed insects are present in the orchards every year, and are capable of causing heavy damage to seed crops.
A variety of control measures can generally limit the effects of most insects to minor or acceptable amounts of damage.
The exceptions are cone and seed insects, and insect population bursts and very localized small outbreaks of other insects.
Many serious bark-boring insects attack trees that are larger and older than those currently found in the orchards.
Thus, the risk to tree survival will increase in future years when the orchard trees mature further.
Also, insect populations will slowly increase in the orchards and surrounding areas as the trees become older and produce more cones (due to a slow building and survival of these insect populations), increasing the risk of population bursts and resulting damage.
1.1.2.2 Disease The location of each seed orchard probably helps isolate it from some of the serious root diseases that may otherwise affect cultivated species in a forest environment.
Specifically: Â· Provolt is on agricultural lands outside of the southern Oregon forest stands of Douglasfir.
Pathogens such as Armillaria root disease (Armillaria ostoyae and Armillaria mellea), laminated root disease (Phellinus weirii), and black stain root disease (Leptographium wageneri) are some of the more aggressive diseases affecting Douglas-fir in the forest.
Some of these pathogens may also be present in the orchard soils, but are passive and have caused very little damage to orchard trees.
Â· Sprague is on mixed conifer and hardwood forest lands, somewhat isolated from the primary southern Oregon forest stands of mixed conifers.
Pathogens such as Armillaria root disease, annosus root disease (Heterobasidion annosum), Phytophthora root disease, and white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) are some of the more aggressive diseases affecting sugar pine in the forest.
Sugar pine grows naturally in the southern Oregon forests as a minor (in numbers) conifer component, not in pure forest stands (such as Douglas-fir often grows) and as is designed in a seed orchard.
Some of these pathogens are present also in the orchard and, although they are normally passive, they have caused varying (but generally limited) amounts of damage to orchard trees.
Root diseases cause mortality annually, but seem to be aggressive in pockets or small areas in the orchard where stress factors are present, such as high water table, poor root conditions from seedling handling methods, lack of water, or extreme temperatures.
Foliar diseases have also affected orchard trees in small outbreaks and limited areas.
Douglasfir rust (Melampsora occidentali), Phomopsis canker (Phomopsis lokoyae), and Rhabdocline needle cast have been found occasionally at Provolt.
The sugar pines at Sprague and Provolt are susceptible to white pine blister rust, an exotic fungus which affects the stem, branches, and needles.
The sugar pines at Sprague and Provolt are selected based on types and levels of blister rust resistance identified from blister rust screenings and analysis of results.
However, despite the blister rust resistance levels and mechanisms, the pathogen is capable of infecting and damaging branches and sometimes whole trees.
Atropellis canker in sugar pine, and Lophodermella needle casts in sugar pine (and in ponderosa pine at Sprague), have been found occasionally, causing Chapter 1 -- 3
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM minor damage and no mortality.
The trees suffer foliage or branch damage and needle drop plus some stress, but the affect is temporary and the recovery has been good.
In the forests of southern Oregon, these diseases can cause greater amounts of damage, such as growth loss, top kill and deformation, but generally only killing small trees.
When the trees are healthy, all of these diseases, except blister rust, cause minor damage such as branch or stem deformation, and loss of vigor and growth.
Except for white pine blister rust, these diseases seldom result in mortality.
Most of these diseases become aggressive in stress situations, when trees are lacking sufficient moisture or nutrients, when environmental conditions are severe, or when humans or animals cause damage to trees.
Sunscald, high temperatures, frost, prolonged high water table, drought, unusual rainy periods, or other extreme conditions such as wind and heavy snow can cause physical injury, weaken a tree, and expose it to diseases.
Management and cultural practices in the orchards can reduce the risk of injury and stress, thus reducing the risk of disease.
Disease outbreaks in severe conditions can be a future problem as trees mature.
1.1.2.3 Vegetation Wanted and unwanted vegetation occurs in many forms and locations throughout both orchards.
A variety of unwanted native and exotic herbaceous vegetation, mostly grasses and broad leaf plants, are found along fence lines and roadways, around buildings, along irrigation ditches and the edges of ponds, around the perimeters of orchard units, on the edges of undeveloped riparian or wooded areas, in and around the administration sites (including around parking lots, walkways, storage areas, fuel tanks), in fallow areas that are developed but not planted with conifers, and in special use areas (such as flood damaged restoration areas and hardwood production areas at Provolt, and the native species gardens at Sprague).
Unwanted woody hardwood and conifer tree and shrub species grow from sprouts or seeds in border or edge areas along fence lines and roads, along riparian areas, or in fallow areas.
Blackberry species, black cottonwood, red alder, pines and cedars, sedges, willows, and, at Sprague, poison oak often create hazards or impediments to normal orchard operations.
Other vegetation introduces contaminating "weed" seed into pure native plant seed beds, affecting the quality of the source seed being produced.
Noxious weeds are a type of unwanted (and in many cases exotic) vegetation at both seed orchards, occurring in a variety of locations and conditions throughout the orchard lands.
These plant species are officially designated as noxious weeds on county, state, and Federal lists for identification and control.
Unwanted and uncontrolled vegetation provides fuel loading for potential wildfires.
Provolt is in a rural community surrounded by farms and homes with acreage, where a county highway provides one border and a state highway divides the orchard nearly in half.
Sprague is within a rural residential community surrounded by homes with acreage; county roads form two borders, with private roads found along or near two borders, and a Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad line passing through a section of the orchard.
The risk of wildfire in the interfaces of orchard lands with public roads, homes, and, at Sprague, a railroad, is very high.
The control of vegetation height in the orchard units, fallow open land areas, and borders is essential to reduce the rapid spread of grass fires.
At Provolt, in the summer of 2000, a small wildfire in an orchard unit with short ground cover vegetation (controlled by tractor mowing) resulted in the loss of crop trees and irrigation system components.
It demonstrated the rapid spread of fire in orchard cover crop and the importance of controlling the vegetation.
Competition for water, nutrients, and light among the orchard trees, and planted and maintained cover crop vegetation in the orchard units, occurs during the active growing season.
Reduction of vegetation increases available soil moisture and nutrients to the trees.
Unwanted and uncontrolled vegetation near orchard trees also is a physical barrier from efficient irrigation spray patterns of sprinklers and micro jet emitters.
The uncontrolled vegetation is also a physical barrier to safe and efficient foot and vehicular travel.
Uncontrolled vegetation also provides protective hiding and nesting cover for rodents and other animals, which cause damage to orchard trees, irrigation systems, building foundations, road Chapter 1 -- 4
Chapter 1 -- Introduction surfaces, and the lands in the orchard units.
Rodents chew and eat tree roots and bark, and sometimes eat foliage.
Rodents also chew and damage plastic irrigation lines and emitters and electrical wiring; burrow under concrete foundations, undermining building integrity; and burrow into roadways and throughout orchard units, causing erosion, degradation, and an uneven surface.
Any uneven surface, in turn, creates a safety hazard when using high lifts, utility vehicles, or allterrain vehicles (ATVs).
Keeping vegetation low reduces animal cover and increases opportunity for predation on these animals by raptors and carnivores, thereby reducing the damage.
Because the perimeter fences surrounding the developed areas at each orchard (eight-foot high woven wire with partially buried smaller mesh wire at the bottom at Provolt; seven-foot high chain link with barbed wire at the top at Sprague) represent a very high capital investment, vegetation has been controlled along these fence lines.
If left uncontrolled, this vegetation, especially blackberry, poison oak, Scotch broom and other aggressive plant species, would ultimately overgrow and affect the structural integrity of these fences and their ability to act as barriers.
1.1.2.4 Animal Pests A wide variety of animal habitat exists in and around the seed orchards, including grass- and tree-covered orchard units, open grass-covered fallow areas, open woodlots, brushy hedgerows and edge areas, fence lines, and roadsides.
Provolt also has irrigation ditches and ponds, a large river, and a major stream with riparian areas.
Sprague has a small lake and intermittent drainages, culverts, and riparian areas.
These habitats attract a wide mixed variety of animals, which live and feed in the orchard.
The seven miles of eight-foot high woven wire fence material at Provolt excludes big game from the orchard.
A partially buried smaller mesh wire is attached to the base of the fence for a deterrent to rabbits.
The developed orchard lands at Sprague are protected with three and one half miles of seven-foot high chain link fence with barbed wire at the top, which acts as a big game exclosure.
In the early development years, the fences were essential for keeping the black-tailed deer, black-tailed jack rabbit, and brush rabbit away from small tender seedlings and grafted trees, as well as expensive graft-compatible rootstock at Provolt and disease-resistant rootstock at Sprague.
As the trees grew out of browsing reach from the deer and the bark thickness of older trees was no longer attractive to rabbits, the fence continued to be an important deterrent from deer from doing antler damage to tree stems, to cows from wandering into the orchard (at Provolt), and to any large animals from doing damage to the irrigation system.
Deer occasionally get into both orchards through open gates during the day when the orchards are open for business, or through gaps under the fence.
Rodents such as the western pocket gopher, and a variety of mice and voles, such as the longtailed vole and deer mouse, all cause damage to young tree roots and lower stems by eating plant tissue.
Older trees can be damaged by porcupines, which eat inner bark tissue and girdle the tree stem.
At Sprague, porcupines caused serious damage to several orchard units of sugar pine in the early 1990s, until the animals were removed by trapping and shooting.
Ground squirrels tunnel around the foundations of buildings, in and near roads, and in the orchard lands, creating hazards to facilities and people.
Beaver at both orchards cause damage to hardwood trees and conifers along the perimeter of ponds and the Sprague lake.
Other animals cause damage to portions of the irrigation systems at each orchard (1-inch poly supply line, Â¼-inch poly supply line, plastic risers, and emitters).
The coyote, gray fox, opossum, striped and spotted skunk, raccoon, domestic dogs, and some of the rodents listed above chew off and remove, or chew holes in, the irrigation system parts, which causes leaks and water loss, requires time and money to repair, and prevents the trees from getting water.
At Sprague, the western gray squirrel can cause great amounts of damage and loss to cones on the trees, and could easily destroy an entire crop of cones.
The squirrels come into the orchard from adjacent woodlands to hunt in the orchard for food, including the cones hanging on orchard trees in the insect protection bags.
Chapter 1 -- 5
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM Some animals causing damage are also predators for other animals that damage orchard crops.
Animals are generally welcome and accepted at Provolt and Sprague until populations rise, food preferences shift to orchard crops, or damage becomes unacceptable.
1.2 Location Of Provolt And Sprague Seed Orchards Figure 1.2-1 shows the locations of the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards.
1.2.1 Provolt Seed Orchard The Provolt Seed Orchard is located approximately 15 miles southeast of the city of Grants Pass and 25 miles west of Medford, Oregon, near the small community of Provolt and within Josephine and Jackson Counties.
It lies within the Applegate River valley of the Klamath Mountains province.
1.2.2 Sprague Seed Orchard The Sprague Seed Orchard is located approximately ten miles northwest of the city of Grants Pass and 40 miles northwest of Medford, Oregon, near the small community of Merlin and within Josephine County.
It lies within the Jump-off Joe Creek valley of the Klamath Mountains province.
1.3 Scoping Comments And Issues Numerous scoping-related activities were conducted for this EIS between 1999 and 2002.
These are described in BLM's Scoping Report for the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards (BLM 2002a) and summarized in Section 5.1 of this document.
Scoping comments received during this time are described in detail in BLM's Public Comment Summary Report for Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards (BLM 2002b), and summarized herein.
Fifty-two public comments were received from 20 responders.
While several commentors supported a full IPM program, including chemical pesticides, more expressed concern about the potential associated impacts and favored a program without chemical pesticides.
Table 1.3-1 summarizes the number of comments by major category for both orchards.
Note that some commentors had more than one comment.
These comments reflect the major issues that require consideration by the decisionmaker in developing the ROD for this EIS. Three commentors at the Provolt open house were adjacent or nearby landowners and either had no comments on the proposed IPM program or supported the use of pesticides.
Two members of the public and one adjacent landowner who attended the Sprague open house also had no comments or concerns about the proposed IPM program.
Commentors at both orchards also had several comments considered out of scope (wanted to tour orchard, get permission to ride mountain bikes on site, or get information about tree pests found at their homes).
Out of scope comments are not considered in this EIS.
In July 2002, four commentors at the Provolt Seed Orchard were in favor of an IPM program that allows a full range of pest management alternatives, including chemical pesticide use.
These included two orchard cooperators, an adjacent landowner, and the Josephine County Board of County Commissioners.
The remaining commentors at the open houses in 1999 and in response to the 2002 scoping efforts expressed concern about the proposed IPM program, particularly the use of chemical pesticides and their potential impacts on human health and safety, drinking water supplies, soils, and wildlife, including threatened and endangered species.
Numerous commentors opposed the use of chemical pesticides, including the Provolt Grange 912, represented by a quorum of 70 members, and another member of the public who represented herself as well as the Coast Range Guardians and Canaries Who Sing.
She expressed concern about the effects of insecticides in particular (specifically Chapter 1 -- 6

esfenvalerate) on soil, tree health, and ecological resources, including plants, wildlife, and coho salmon.
She provided copies of two recent court decisions relating to salmon and pesticide use, and to pesticides entering waters of the U.S. Specific environmental impact concerns associated with potential use of chemical pesticides and expressed during scoping are identified below: Â· Human health (general, from picking and eating blackberries, drift, drinking water); Â· Safety (from fire/burning); Â· Air quality (drift); Â· Water resources (groundwater and shallow wells, watershed, drinking water); Â· Soils (contaminated food); and Â· Ecological impacts (risks to large raptors and other sensitive species, including coho salmon; potential accumulation of toxins).
In addition to the concerns associated with pesticides and their potential impacts, many comments related to alternatives.
Many alternatives-related comments indicated support for the proposed IPM program, including chemical pesticide use, while other comments supported consideration of non-chemical alternatives.
Specific non-chemical alternatives that were suggested included the following: Â· Use a steam treatment method for weed control that uses infrared radiation; Â· Use volunteers to perform hand labor on pests; Â· Harvest and sell weeds as herbs; Â· Use a more passive approach like raptor perches; Â· Use only organic sources of fertilizer and pest control; Â· Use soap sprays, biological controls such as Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.), and/or enhancing conditions for insect-eating birds; Chapter 1 -- 8
Chapter 1 -- Introduction Â· Plant more crop trees than necessary to allow for some loss of pests; and Â· Employ environmentally benign methods such as placement of birdhouses and batboxes.
In general, all commentors favored pest control methods that included mechanical and biological methods.
Finally, the Williams Fire and Rescue Chief recommended that any pest control involving burning at the orchard follow the same fire restrictions as are in place for the general public, to be consistent and to address potential safety concerns.
All of the scoping comments received and considered to be within scope are addressed in this EIS.
Specific environmental resources of concern identified during scoping and analyzed in Chapter 4 are human health and safety, soils, ecological resources (including vegetation, terrestrial wildlife, and aquatic species), and water quality.
This EIS also addresses potential impacts to other resources that were not identified during scoping, but required evaluation to determine if any impacts were possible: air quality, land use, noise, cultural resources, and socioeconomics.
1.4 Relationship To Plans, Policies, And Programs 1.4.1 Related BLM Plans, Policies, and Programs The Medford District Resource Management Plan (RMP) (BLM 1995) included the seed orchards within the District Defined Reserve system.
These reserves were established for protection of specific resources, flora and fauna, and other values.
These seed orchard values included preservation of genetic materials, production of improved seed, and various orchard developments and facilities.
The provisions of the Medford District RMP found in the resource program sections for Energy and Minerals; Land Tenure Adjustments; Rights-of-Way, Access, and Withdrawals; and the information in Appendices D--Best Management Practices-Roads and Landings, and F--Forest Genetics Program, apply to the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards.
Except for these specific sections, the objectives and management actions/direction described in the Medford District RMP are not applicable to Provolt and Sprague.
A categorical exclusion (CX) was prepared in 1996 for the use of pesticides for insect and disease control in the greenhouse nursery at Sprague (BLM 1996) The Sprague Seed Orchard is administratively withdrawn.
Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1700 et seq.) describes "withdrawal" as "withholding an area of Federal land from settlement, sale, location, or entry, under some or all of the general land laws, for the purpose of limiting activities under those laws in order to maintain other public values in the area or reserving the area for a particular public purpose or program."
It was noted as a public land withdrawal under the Medford District RMP (BLM 1995).
Specifically, Public Land Order (PLO) 4132 withdrew the 200 acres at the seed orchard from entry under general land laws and mining laws.
The Provolt Seed Orchard is entirely on acquired lands which were formerly in agricultural use, are not subject to withdrawals under PLOs, and are exempt from general land and mining laws.
BLM's Oregon State Office concluded that these intensively developed sites were not intended to meet the standards and guidelines for forest health as generally provided in the Medford District RMP, which incorporated and superceded the Northwest Forest Plan (BLM 2000).
In addition, standards and guidelines for various resources, such as Survey and Manage and Protection Buffer Species, while applicable to many administrative withdrawals, are not intended to be applied to intensively developed and used areas, such as the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards (BLM 2000).
The orchards are not considered appropriate or available for conversion to a late-successional reserve or any other land use allocation which might directly serve as scarce Chapter 1 -- 9
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM or important habitat (BLM 2000).
BLM's findings distinguish the unique nature of these sites from other administrative withdrawals, such as Research Natural Areas, which are designed and designated to be important components of the broad ecosystem management direction under the RMP. BLM prepared and supplemented a programmatic-level EIS for Northwest Area Noxious Weed Control (BLM 1987).
The ROD authorized use of specific herbicide formulations to control noxious weeds.
The herbicide products contain dicamba, glyphosate, picloram, or 2,4-D as the active ingredient.
Noxious weed control projects at Provolt and Sprague using these herbicides would be authorized under this 1987 ROD, and by the 1998 BLM project-specific EA for glyphosate use within the Medford District between 1999 and 2002 (BLM 1998).
Subsequent to the 1987 noxious weed control EIS, BLM prepared an EIS and ROD for the Western Oregon Program for Management of Competing Vegetation (BLM 1992b).
This ROD selected an IPM approach with a preference for non-herbicide methods, and applies to all BLM-administered land in the Coos Bay, Eugene, Medford, Roseburg, and Salem Districts, and part of the Lakeview District.
Actions covered under the 1987 Noxious Weed Control EIS are excepted from this decision.
There is currently an injunction prohibiting BLM from applying herbicides.
It has been partially lifted to allow applications for noxious weeds, as covered under the NEPA documents described in the preceding paragraph.
Except for these uses, the injunction would have to be lifted (in its entirety or specifically for the seed orchards) before herbicides could be used as described in this EIS. BLM is undertaking a programmatic EIS for vegetation treatment on public lands administered by the BLM in the western U.S., including Alaska.
This programmatic EIS will consolidate, update, and replace analyses contained in existing BLM vegetation treatment EISs, as well as include lands not analyzed in the existing documents.
The programmatic EIS is not intended to affect specific Agency management decisions developed under local land-use plans, but will provide a baseline cumulative impact assessment that local BLM offices, including the Medford District Office, can use as they develop or update each district land use plan/EIS.
The public scoping comment period on the programmatic EIS ended March 29, 2002.
The draft EIS is scheduled for completion in mid-2003.
In the absence of this IPM EIS, Medford has prepared project-specific EAs for past glyphosate use, as noted above, and for esfenvalerate use for cone insect control in sugar pine at Sprague between 1992 and 1996 (BLM 1992a).
Once a decision is issued on the basis of this EIS, however, such project-specific NEPA documentation should no longer be required at Provolt or Sprague, since the ROD will make available to the seed orchard manager a variety of pest control methods that can be implemented to control specific pests in a manner that best fulfills orchard goals.
BLM's Salem and Eugene Districts in western Oregon are developing pest management EISs for their two seed orchards concurrently with this one for Medford.
Specifically, the Salem District is developing an EIS for the Horning Seed Orchard, and the Eugene District is developing a second EIS for the Tyrrell Seed Orchard.
Both EISs are being prepared under the same project schedule as this EIS for Provolt and Sprague.
1.4.2 Relevant Federal, State, and Local Statutes and Guidelines Pest management at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards would follow all relevant Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.
Major legislation relating to this EIS includes the following.
Â· National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), as amended: requires Federal agencies to prepare an EIS if a proposed action has a potential for significant environmental impacts.
Chapter 1 -- 10
Chapter 1 -- Introduction Â· The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947, as amended (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.): establishes procedures for the registration, classification, and regulation of all pesticides.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for implementing FIFRA; primary enforcement responsibilities for use-related violations are assigned to states with approved programs.
Before any pesticide may be sold legally, it must be registered by EPA.
EPA may classify a pesticide for unrestricted use if it determines that the pesticide is not likely to cause unreasonable adverse effects on applicators or the environment.
States may classify pesticides for restricted use (which means they may be applied only by or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator or in accordance with other restrictions), even though EPA may not have done so.
Â· The Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1857 et seq.): sets national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, requires that specific emission increases be evaluated to prevent a significant deterioration in air quality, and provides EPA with authority to set national standards for performance of new stationary sources of air pollutants and standards for emissions of hazardous air pollutants.
Â· The Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387) of 1984, as amended: charges EPA the nation's water resources and wetlands, and controlling the discharge of toxic The Act defines water quality standards for priority toxic pollutants, oversees the treatment program, and provides local governments with the authority to control discharges of toxics.
with protecting chemicals.
industrial prenon-industrial
Â· The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 300(f) et seq.): established a national structure for drinking water protection activities.
The Act authorized EPA to establish national, enforceable health standards for contaminants in drinking water; provided for public water system compliance through a Federal-state partnership; established public notification to alert customers to water system violations; and set up procedures to protect underground sources of drinking water.
The 1996 amendments to the SDWA required states to develop source water assessment programs (SWAPs) that outline an approach for conducting source water assessments, delineate the boundaries of areas from which public drinking water systems receive drinking water, and identify the origins of regulated and unregulated contaminants.
In Oregon, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) has state primacy for implementing the SDWA and administers both the SWAP and the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program through this authorization.
Through both the SWAP and UIC programs, ODEQ seeks to ensure the protection of groundwater that is used for drinking water.
BLM supports ODEQ's efforts by contributing data and information to ODEQ's UIC registry of sites.
Among the sites registered under ODEQ's UIC program are Class V injection wells.
EPA Region 10 defines Class V injection wells to be systems, structures, or activities that allow for subsurface placement of fluid directly.
In most instances a hole or a trench using piping would qualify if the purpose or intent is for subsurface discharge either through infiltration or injection.
Operation and maintenance activities at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards do not involve subsurface placement (that is, injection) of potential contaminants and therefore have not been registered with ODEQ.
However, because the potential for an unintended spill or discharge always exists, best management practices for spill recovery that reference ODEQ's UIC best management practices (ODEQ 1999) would be developed and included in an emergency response plan.
Â· The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 (as amended): establishes Federal policies and procedures for protecting endangered and threatened species of fish, wildlife, and plants.
Section 7 requires Federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Fisheries (NOAA Fisheries) (formerly known as the National Marine Fisheries Service, or NMFS) to ensure that any action that they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued survival of a
Chapter 1 -- 11
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM listed species or result in the adverse modification or destruction of its critical habitat (16 U.S.C. 1536 (a) (2)).
In addition, the Act requires that if species proposed for listing are likely to be jeopardized, consultation must be held with the FWS or NOAA Fisheries.
This consultation may result in modification or abandonment of an action.
Â· Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-711): except as allowed by implementing regulations, this act makes it unlawful to pursue, hunt, kill, capture, possess, buy, sell, purchase, or barter any migratory bird, including the feathers or other parts, nests, eggs, or migratory bird products.
Â· Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.): encourages Federal agencies to conserve and promote conservation of nongame fish and wildlife and their habitats to the maximum extent possible within each agency's statutory responsibilities.
Â· Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996: requires the identification and protection of essential fish habitat (EFH) for important Federally managed fisheries resources (that is, marine and anadromous fisheries).
In freshwater, EFH includes habitats for spawning and incubation, juvenile rearing, juvenile migration corridors, and adult migration corridors.
Federal agencies are required to consult with NOAA Fisheries if their actions may adversely affect EFH.
With respect to the ESA, the U.S. District Court in Seattle ruled on a case between the Washington Toxics Coalition and EPA on July 3, 2002 (Washington Toxics Coalition et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency and Christine Todd Whitman, Administrator).
The purpose of this lawsuit was to compel EPA to consult with NOAA Fisheries (formerly NMFS) over its registrations of pesticides known to affect fish.
The court found that EPA was in violation of ESA because EPA had not consulted with NOAA Fisheries, and determined that EPA needed to consult with them on 55 of the pesticides identified in the case, eight of which are proposed for use at Provolt and Sprague (acephate, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dicamba, dimethoate, propargite, and triclopyr).
The EPA-NOAA Fisheries consultation has not been completed as of the date of this Draft EIS.
In another lawsuit, the League of Wilderness and seven other environmental groups appealed a district court finding to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging the U.S. Forest Service's annual aerial insecticide spraying program covering over 628,000 acres of national forest lands in Washington and Oregon [League of Wilderness Defenders et al. v. Harv Forsgren and U.S. Forest Service, 309 F.3d 1181 9th Cir. (2002)].
The spraying was aimed at controlling a predicted outbreak of the Douglas-fir tussock moth, and included planned direct overspray of natural bodies of water during the course of treating forested areas.
The plaintiffs asserted that the EIS was inadequate, and that the Forest Service failed to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, which is required by the Clean Water Act for point source pollutant discharges to water.
Although the district court had granted summary judgment in favor of the Forest Service, the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision on appeal in an opinion issued on November 4, 2002.
The Forest Service has been prohibited from further spraying until it acquires an NPDES permit and completes a revised EIS.
At this time, this judicial decision does not appear relevant to pest management activities at Provolt or Sprague, since no discharge to, or direct spray of, surface water is planned under any of the alternatives.
BLM's pest management would be conducted in accordance with all applicable state and local government regulations, including two laws specific to the Department of the Interior and BLM: the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670 et seq.), as amended, and FLPMA.
The Sikes Act authorizes the Department of the Interior, in cooperation with state agencies responsible for the administration of fish and game laws, to plan, develop, maintain, and coordinate programs for the conservation and rehabilitation of wildlife, fish and game on public lands within its jurisdiction.
FLPMA requires BLM to manage public lands and their resources for multiple use, and to develop resource management plans for lands under BLM's jurisdiction.
Chapter 1 -- 12
Chapter 1 -- Introduction State and county weed control laws place responsibility for noxious weed control on individual land owners, including the Federal government.
Permittees and grantees operating rights-of-way on BLM-administered land are required to comply with Department of the Interior herbicide use regulations.
BLM must also coordinate with appropriate state agencies in managing state-listed plant and animal species when a state has formally made such designations.
1.5 Organization Of This Eis This document is organized into four main chapters.
Background and support information, including a summary of the human health and ecological risk assessments, is provided in the appendices.
The Draft EIS presents four alternatives for managing pests at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards, including the no action alternative, and examines the potential environmental impacts of each alternative.
Chapter 1, Purpose and Need, identifies the purpose and need for action, provides an introduction to typical pests found at the orchards, and discusses the public issues surrounding pest management and other considerations.
Chapter 2, Alternatives, presents and compares the alternatives, with information on how they would be implemented with measures to protect the environment.
Chapter 3, Affected Environment, includes a description of the physical, biological, and social setting of the orchards.
Chapter 4, Environmental Consequences, addresses changes likely to occur with implementation of any of the alternatives.
In addition to the four main chapters, the document contains these sections: Executive Summary; Table of Contents; Chapter 5--Consultation and Coordination (including scoping process, consultation list, and a list of agencies, organizations, and individuals to whom copies of the statement were sent); Chapter 6--List of Preparers; Chapter 7--References; a list of acronyms; a glossary; and an index.

Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action
2.0 Description Of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action 2.1 Background 2.1.1 Seed Orchards, Tree Improvement Program, and Genetics BLM manages four centralized tree seed orchards in western Oregon: Provolt and Sprague in the Medford District, Horning in the Salem District, and Tyrrell in the Eugene District.
Historically, the seed orchards' role was to provide genetically improved Douglas-fir and sugar pine seed and seedlings to the five western Oregon districts and the western Klamath Falls resource area for reforestation and progeny test programs.
A major shift in management emphasis in the districts' RMPs sharply decreased the need for seeds for reforestation.
Therefore, the seed needed for BLM purposes from the BLM seed orchards was greatly reduced.
To allow BLM to cost-effectively manage the seed orchards, an effort has been made to share the seed orchards with other cooperators.
Consequently, the seed needs from many of the orchard units have increased because of strong cooperator interest.
Orchard Operations There are two types of BLM seed orchards, each serving a different purpose.
In breeding and preservation orchard units, trees from the same clone/family are planted in tight spacing and located together.
The main purpose of these orchard units is to breed for advanced generation programs and/or preserve genetic material (clone banks).
They do not represent the total genetic variation selected within the breeding zone.
This variation is more appropriately preserved in the progeny test sites.
In seed production orchard units, trees from different clones/families within the same seed zone are planted at wider spacing and are designed to facilitate good mixing of pollen and reduce self-pollination.
The main purpose of the seed production orchard units is to produce genetically improved seed for reforestation.
There are Phase I and Phase II seed production units.
In most cases, the Phase I units have been established with the first generation clonal material, and will be the main source of seed for the current and next decade.
Most of the Phase II units are undeveloped and are reserved for advanced generation orchards.
Provolt Seed Orchard Provolt consists of 300 acres of Applegate River alluvial bench lands purchased in 1980 to 1982 from contiguous private landowners.
The land use at the time of purchase was agricultural grazing and hay crop production, primarily for a large dairy farm.
BLM converted and developed the land by plowing, disking, land planing, and rock removal.
The orchard's infrastructure was formed in the 1980s and 1990s, including perimeter animal exclosure fencing, interior road construction, reconstruction and removal of site buildings, and the development of an irrigation system consisting of underground pipe distribution.
In 1986, the first Douglas-fir rootstock seedlings were planted.
The first grafting work was done in 1988.
Douglas-fir orchard unit development was completed in 1995, with a total of 17 orchard units representing southwest Oregon geographical and elevational cooperative breeding (seed) zones.
In 1996, white pine blister rust disease-resistant sugar pine development began for future seed production and gene preservation.
Provolt has shifted from the developmental stage of its first 20 years since land purchase, into a maintenance and seed production phase.
The orchard is not a naturally highly productive Douglas-fir or sugar pine site, because the welldrained alluvial soils and southern Oregon climate provide limiting soil moisture and temperature environmental factors.
Irrigation, fertilization, and a variety of cultural, biological, mechanical, manual, and chemical applications are used to mitigate the limiting factors and to maintain healthy Chapter 2 -- 1
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM and vigorous orchard seed trees.
Trees that are not under stress, and are free to grow without undue competition, or soil moisture and nutrient deficiency, are better able to sustain the presence and effects of insects, disease, and other pests.
Without the necessary water, nutrients, and pest management, the trees could not survive on the site, and cone and seed production in sufficient quality and quantity would not be possible.
By conifer orchard standards, Provolt is a young seed orchard, with the oldest orchard units being 15 years old from graft, and most other orchard units being 8 to 12 years old.
The first seed crops in the orchard occurred in 1995 to 2000, with very limited amounts of cones (50 to 100 bushels per year) and relatively low seed yields (0.1 to 0.2 pounds (lb) of seed per bushel of cones; good yields average 0.3 to 0.6 lb per bushel).
The BLM Provolt Seed Orchard and the Applegate River Watershed Council jointly manage a small two-acre native plant production area at Provolt.
A variety of mostly hardwood plants (black cottonwood, willow, dogwood, bigleaf maple, red alder, ninebark, and Oregon ash) are propagated in containers or production bedrows for planting on Applegate River watershed lands for riparian restoration.
American Forests Â­ Global ReLeaf grants have funded the project for the past seven years.
Figure 2.1-1 depicts the layout of the Provolt Seed Orchard and its seed production units.
Sprague Seed Orchard Sprague occupies 200 acres of former mixed conifer and hardwood forestland in the BLMMedford District land base, which was harvested of trees and developed into a seed orchard in the mid to late 1960s.
The flat to rolling lands were converted from forestland and developed into useable orchard land by harvest, stump removal, plowing, disking, land planing, and removal of rocks and wood.
Perimeter animal exclosure fencing, interior road construction, building and infrastructure construction, and the development of an underground pipe irrigation system were mostly all constructed prior to the orchard dedication in 1969.
BLM and the U.S. Forest Service jointly planned the orchard facility.
In 1974, the first sugar pine rootstock seedlings were planted, and the first grafting work for orchard unit development was begun in 1977.
One ponderosa pine orchard unit's grafting work was also begun in 1977.
Sugar pine orchard unit development was completed in 1993 with seven orchard units representing southwest Oregon geographical and elevational cooperative breeding (seed) zones.
Five preservation arboretums have also been established to preserve the sugar pine genes of value in the program for the future.
The orchard was developed for the production of white pine blister rust resistant sugar pine seed for reforestation and restoration of an important conifer species suffering from the effects of this introduced exotic fungus disease.
Nearly all of the seven production orchard units are now producing adequate to large amounts of cones and seed, and the orchard has shifted from the developmental stage of its first 30 years, to a maintenance and seed production phase.
Seed is produced annually for the disease resistance sugar pine seed needs of BLM (Medford, Roseburg, and Klamath Falls offices), three National Forests, and seven private timber companies through cooperative agreements.
The orchard site sustained a native sugar pine and ponderosa pine component in the stands of trees on the site and in the surrounding area.
The orchard site is not a naturally highly productive sugar pine site because sugar pine requires well drained soils, and some of the soils in the orchard have a high clay content, perched or shallow water tables during the winter months, and a southern Oregon climate, which provides limiting soil moisture and temperature environmental factors.
Irrigation, fertilization, and a variety of cultural, biological, mechanical, manual, and chemical applications are used to mitigate the limiting factors, and maintain healthy and vigorous orchard seed trees.
Trees that are not under stress, and are free to grow without undue competition, or soil moisture and nutrient deficiency, are better able to sustain the presence and effects of insects, Chapte 2 -- 2

Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action disease, and other pests.
Without the necessary water, nutrients, and pest management, many of the trees could not survive on the site, and cone and seed production in sufficient quality and quantity would not be possible.
By conifer standards, Sprague Seed Orchard (sugar pine and ponderosa pine) is mid-age, with the two oldest orchard units being nearly 25 years old and producing large quantities of seed.
Four other orchard units are 15 to 20 years from graft and producing good amounts of seed annually.
The single young orchard unit is 12 years old and just beginning to produce seed.
Sprague has a cone storage and drying facility and a 19,000 square foot (ft2) containerized greenhouse facility.
This nursery provides a diverse array of quality plants including conifers, native hardwoods, shrubs, forbs, and grasses for many resource objectives on BLM lands in Oregon and Washington, as well as specialty crops for the Forest Service and other agencies.
The greenhouse complex consists of a greenhouse, shadehouse, small cuttings chamber, cooler, and a staging/holding house, plus a work building and storage area.
Nine small grass gardens totaling three acres are maintained, producing seed from 20 species of native grasses from four Medford District resource areas and two Roseburg District resource areas.
The site's long-range plan identifies 14 acres for grow-out of native species.
Figure 2.1-2 depicts the layout of the Sprague Seed Orchard and its seed production and preservation units.
2.1.2 Ongoing Orchard Activities Under all alternatives, routine management actions for orchard establishment and maintenance activities and nursery seedling production would continue to occur.
However, these actions-- which include orchard establishment, orchard maintenance, containerized greenhouse nursery management, buffer zone management, and facilities/equipment maintenance--are not directly related to IPM and therefore are not evaluated in this EIS.
See also discussion of District RMP in Section 1.4.1.
Orchard Establishment All land clearing at the Sprague and Provolt Seed Orchards was completed during the original establishment period.
Any future site preparation would consist of preparing an existing orchard unit area for a new orchard by removing existing stumps, subsoiling, rototilling or disking, leveling, and cover crop seeding.
These site preparation activities would occur as older orchards are recycled; that is, as trees become too large to harvest cones and are replaced with advanced generation orchard material.
New orchards would periodically be established in the Phase II fallow areas and in orchards that are being recycled.
Approximately 10 acres of orchard are likely to be recycled over the next decade, and approximately 30 acres in the following decade.
Individual tree positions in new orchards would be rototilled to prepare the area for planting.
Trees would be planted by shovel, tree spade, or power augur; mulched with porous fiber or poly mats to help control competing vegetation and retain soil moisture; shaded with cards or screens to reduce seedling basal heat damage and overall tree stress; and tubed with mesh cylinders or fencing material to prevent animal damage and vegetation loss.
Most of the first generation seed orchard units are clonal and contain the best parent trees selected from natural forest stands and tested in progeny testing programs.
Cuttings would be taken from the best parent trees, based on progeny test results, and grafted onto rootstock in the orchard units.
Orchard trees would occasionally be transplanted with various sizes of tree spades.
All genetic improvements at Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards are based on selective breeding; the seed orchards are not equipped and have no programs for direct genetic manipulation.
Chapter 2 -- 5
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM
Chapte 2 -- 6
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action In addition to conifer tree seed production orchards, some small areas would be established for native grasses, forbs, hardwood trees, and shrub gardens; and bed rows for seed and vegetation production.
There are currently about nine acres of these other orchard areas at Provolt and Sprague, and establishment of a total of 10 acres of new production areas is planned.
Actions for establishment and maintenance of these other orchard areas would not be substantially different from the conifer tree seed production orchards.
Orchard Maintenance Orchard trees would be pruned to remove unwanted rootstock vegetation (as graft unions become established), to remove lower limbs to improve access for equipment operation, and to thin and shape tree crowns.
In addition, some orchard trees would be topped to reduce tree height and thereby facilitate cone collection.
Cones would be collected using contract tree climbers, orchard ladders, ATV-mounted ladders, or high lifts.
Cones would be removed from trees, bagged, transported to cone storage facilities, stored to dry, and transported to seed extraction facilities.
Orchards would be thinned to increase the light for increased tree crown development and improved pollen flow.
Thinning would also be used to remove the lower ranked clones (roguing), which would usually occur when the trees are from 10 to 15 years old.
Trees would be felled, limbed, and removed, or whole-tree removed from the orchard units.
Approximately 25 to 75% of the trees in an orchard unit would typically be removed during the roguing process.
Thinned trees and woody debris from pruning would be disposed of by piling and burning, chipping, or would be sold for firewood.
Some orchard units (production and preservation) would be cut and removed when trees become too large for cost-effective management.
New orchard units would generally then be established on the same land.
Other orchard maintenance activities would include tree staking, tree identification tag maintenance, irrigation system maintenance, and bark scoring to improve graft compatibility.
Buffer Zone Management The buffer zones are non-usable areas between seed orchard units that are too steep or wet for orchard units, have riparian characteristics, are vacant land areas, or are otherwise unsuitable or not planned for seed orchard unit development.
These areas are not intensively managed and are maintained as pollen buffers, wildlife corridors, stream protection, riparian habitat, or similar uses.
Sometimes sapling conifers of the same species as adjacent orchard unit species are removed from the buffer zones to limit pollen contamination of production orchards.
Brush may sometimes also be removed from the buffer zones to reduce fire hazard and prevent encroachment into orchard units.
Facilities/Equipment Maintenance Gravel access roads within the orchard would be maintained every three to five years by grading, rocking, rolling, and occasionally surfacing with chip seal to provide year-round access to the primary project areas of the orchard.
The road maintenance work would sometimes include bar ditch cleaning and culvert maintenance.
Road maintenance activities would occur on approximately one mile of road per year.
New road segments might occasionally be built to provide access into newly established or new emphasis areas, but no new construction is anticipated at this time.
Any future new road construction would include grading, rocking, rolling, and ditch and culvert installation.
The animal exclosure and security fence and gates around the perimeter of the orchards would receive regular maintenance, repair, and improvements.
Buildings, utilities, irrigation systems, security systems, and a variety of vehicles and equipment would receive regular maintenance, repair, and improvements.
Chapter 2 -- 7
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM
Containerized Greenhouse Nursery Management A small nursery complex on the Sprague orchard lands consists of a greenhouse, shadehouse, center-span production/holding house, greenhouse work building, cuttings chamber, 250-ft2 modular cooler, two materials storage buildings, loading dock, hazardous materials storage building, and a wastewater filter/pump house and settling and storage tanks, with one acre of distribution sprinkler field.
The growing houses total 19,000-ft2, which can accommodate an average of 300,000 large container seedlings annually and a maximum of 800,000 small container seedlings.
Well water for irrigation, soluble fertilizers, and pesticides are delivered to plants through overhead, fixed, drop-riser, and moving boom irrigation systems, which are regulated to specific sections of the growing houses.
The heating, cooling, and watering systems are electronically controlled and monitored for a controlled environment.
Ceiling fans and heating tubes at floor level distribute propane-generated heat in both greenhouse and shadehouse buildings.
The greenhouse cooling system uses large wall fans and outside air pulled through a bank of cooling cells, while roof vents and a temperature-controlled screen wall provide air movement in the shadehouse.
Greenhouse lighting is available to meet special species' physiological requirements.
Metal tables on wheels allow for movement of plants to different environmental areas depending on container type, plant needs, and growing season.
An IPM approach incorporates a wide variety of strategies using mechanical, biological, and occasionally chemical control options (no chemical control in past three years), which are deployed at predetermined thresholds of risk to the plants and allows greater flexibility with diverse crops.
A nursery wastewater system consists of the collection of all unused water in all growing houses in an enclosed pipeline to a filter house.
The filtered water is moved to a 1,000-gallon (gal) settling tank and 5,000-gal storage tank for automated cover crop irrigation dispersal by an underground movable impulse sprinkler system.
Four 60- to 80-ft deep wells above and below the wastewater distribution area are used for regular ground water quality monitoring.
The three domestic and irrigation wells in the orchard are also used for monitoring ground water quality.
Most annual plant production begins with stratification and sowing of seeds in February through April, thinning and transplanting during May through July, and seedling sorting, packing into boxes, and transporting to coolers for storage before planting in December and January.
Most of the work is accomplished by a BLM nursery horticulturist and local contractors.
The use of pesticides for insect and disease control in the greenhouse nursery at Sprague was addressed in a NEPA categorical exclusion (BLM 1996).
2.2 Integrated Pest Management In The Provolt And Sprague Seed Orchards This section describes the principles of an IPM program and options for controlling insects, disease, vegetation, and animal pests at the seed orchards.
2.2.1 Integrated Pest Management It is the policy of the Department of Interior, and all of its agencies including BLM, to use chemical pesticides only after considering the alternatives; and to develop, support, and adopt IPM strategies wherever practicable (DOI 1981).
The following description of IPM was condensed from information published by the IPM Institute of North America, Inc.
(IPM Inc. 2002).
Chapte 2 -- 8
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action IPM is an approach to solving pest problems by applying our knowledge about pests to prevent them from damaging crops, harming animals, infesting buildings or otherwise interfering with our livelihood or enjoyment of life.
IPM means responding to pest problems with the most effective, least-risk option.
Under IPM, actions are taken to control pests only when their numbers are likely to exceed acceptable levels.
Any action taken is designed to target the troublesome pest, and limit the impact on other organisms and the environment.
Applying pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a routine basis, regardless of need, is not IPM.
Applications of pesticides are always the last resort in an IPM program.
[Components of an IPM program include the following:] Â· Forecasting: Weather data is consulted to predict if and when pest outbreaks will occur.
Treatments can then be properly timed, preventing crop damage and saving sprays.
Â· Pest trapping: Traps that are attractive to insects are used so that growers can pinpoint when the pest has arrived and decide whether control is justified.
Â· Monitoring: Growers inspect representative areas of the fields regularly to determine whether pests are approaching a damaging level.
Â· Thresholds: Before treating, growers wait until pest populations reach a scientifically determined level that could cause economic damage.
Until that threshold is reached, the cost of yield and quality loss will be less than the cost for control.
Â· Cultural controls: The pest's environment is then disrupted by turning under crop residues, sterilizing greenhouse tools, and harvesting early.
Â· Biological controls: It is necessary for growers to conserve the many beneficial natural enemies already at work.
They import and use additional biologicals where effective.
Â· Chemical controls: Growers select the most effective and appropriate pesticide and properly calibrate sprayers.
They then verify that weather conditions will permit good coverage without undue drift.
Â· Recordkeeping: Records of pest traps, weather and treatment are kept for use in pest management decisions.
IPM for seed orchards is the maintenance of seed orchard pests at tolerable levels by the planned use of a variety of preventive, suppressive, or regulatory methods (including no action) that are consistent with orchard management goals.
Each pest management activity is the end result of a decision-making process where pest problems and their impact on hosts are considered, and control methods are analyzed for their effectiveness, as well as their impacts on economics, human health, and the environment.
Deciding which particular method would be used depends on several factors.
Initial questions at the seed orchard might include, "Is it really necessary to control this pest? Can we live with the damage and still have the trees survive and produce suitable amounts of seed?" If the answers are yes and no, respectively, then decisions must be made as to what method(s) of control to use.
Figure 2.2-1 graphically displays the steps involved in carrying out an IPM program in BLM seed orchards.
The focus of IPM is on long-term prevention or suppression of pests. to pest management incorporates the best-suited biological, chemical, have minimum impact on the environment and on people.

Research into better and more effective control methods is also an essential part of this program.
The seed orchard manager would regularly review the pest management methods available for use, including new and developing technologies, to ensure that the seed orchards utilize the most Chapter 2 -- 9
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM effective methods of control while minimizing the potential for any adverse environmental or health impacts.
2.2.2 Pest Management Methods There are many possible methods available to manage vegetation, insects, disease, and animal pests at Provolt and Sprague.
These methods generally fall into the following categories: Â· Biological controls, such as bird or bat boxes to attract insect-eaters, or encouraging predators that can control animal pests.
Â· Chemical herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides.
Â· Prescribed fire to remove vegetation.
Â· Cultural methods, including mechanical (tractor mowing) and manual (pruning) methods, mulch mats, and fences.
Â· Other methods, such as pheromone bait traps for insects.
The sections that follow outline each of these pest management methods in more detail.
2.2.2.1 Biological Control Methods Biological pest control is the deliberate use of natural enemies such as parasites, predators, or disease organisms to reduce pest populations.
Three types of biological control are in use or proposed to manage insect pests: Â· Bird boxes have been installed throughout the two orchards to attract cavity-nesting birds into the orchard to nest and feed.
Â· Bat houses have also been placed throughout the orchards to provide roosting and breeding habitat to encourage bats, such as the big brown bat and little brown myotis, to live in the vicinity and feed on insects in the orchards.
Â· B.t., a biological insecticide, is being considered to help reduce insect damage at the orchards.
In some special use areas of Provolt (such as the riparian restoration areas), newly planted trees, not protected with mulch mats or shade screens for sun and heat protection, rely on the natural and planted herbaceous vegetation (grass and broadleaf plants) to provide some natural shade to the trees and reduce stress and potential diseases.
Control of animal pests has been and would continue to be partially accomplished by encouraging the presence of predators which frequent the orchards.
Birds of prey--such as the red-tailed hawk, American kestrel, barn owl, great horned owl, and black-shouldered kite--are seen hunting and preying on small mammals (mice, voles, gophers, ground squirrels, and rabbits) that are known to cause damage to orchard trees and facilities.
To encourage the birds of prey to use the orchards, perch poles have been installed.
A barn owl nest box is provided in the equipment storage barn at Provolt to encourage nesting by this species.
Bobcats, coyotes, long-tailed weasels, and gray foxes are present at the orchards, sometimes with litters of young.
Disturbance and activity are reduced in the areas of family sightings to encourage the species to populate, feed on rodents, and live in the orchard.
Chapte 2 -- 10
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action
Summary: Biological Control Methods Â· Insects: bird boxes to attract insect-eating birds, bat boxes to attract bats for insect control, B.t. Â· Disease: natural and planted herbaceous vegetation left intact to provide some natural shade to seedlings, thereby reducing stress and potential diseases.
Â· Animal pests: perch poles for birds of prey; barn owl nest box (Provolt); predators including bobcat, coyote, long-tailed weasel, and fox are present and encouraged to populate the seed orchard grounds to aid in the control of animal pests.
2.2.2.2 Chemical Pesticide Methods Three categories of chemical pesticides may be used at Provolt and Sprague: Â· herbicides to control weeds, Â· insecticides to control insects, and Â· fungicides to control diseases caused by fungi.
Many private landowners and commercial operations (including those in the vicinity of the orchards), rely extensively on chemical pesticides to control unwanted pests.
For many years, the Medford seed orchards have managed pests with very limited use of chemicals: Provolt used glyphosate (RodeoÂ®) in 2001 and 2002 to spot-treat noxious weeds.
At Sprague, very limited use has also been made of chemicals: glyphosate (RodeoÂ®) was used from 1999 through 2002 to spot-treat noxious weeds, and esfenvalerate was used for control of cone and seed insects annually from 1992 to 1996 in two orchard units.
Pesticides may be applied using various types of equipment.
These include: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· high-pressure hydraulic sprayer, hydraulic sprayer with hand-held wand, tractor-pulled spray rig with boom, backpack sprayer, hand-held wick, capsule implantation, and broadcast spreader.
Each of these methods is described in an attachment to Appendix C. Table 2.2-1, provided as an attachment at the end of this chapter, lists the chemical pesticides that are included in the alternatives for pest management at Provolt and Sprague, including formulations, target pests, application methods, areas that could be treated, application rates, application frequency, and months when use could occur.
Note that not all chemicals would be used in a given year, and some might never be used.
However, their analysis in this EIS gives the seed orchard manager the option of using them in the future should a specific need arise.
It is also important to note that each chemical application must first be approved by the seed orchard manager.
All pesticides would be applied in compliance with all Federal and Oregon state laws, BLM regulations and policies, the pesticide label, and manufacturer recommendations.
Table 2.2-1 lists pesticides by both active ingredient (a.i.) and trade name.
The active ingredient is the pesticidally active chemical contained in the product proposed for use, such as esfenvalerate or glyphosate.
The trade name is the name of the formulated product that is currently expected to be used, such as AsanaÂ® XL or RoundupÂ®.
A trade name's formulation is described by a specific composition of active ingredient(s) and other ingredients.
The formulation associated with a trade name may change over time.
The chemical pesticide methods proposed in this EIS are described fully as the active ingredients listed in Table 2.2-1.
The trade names provided in the table and Chapter 2 -- 11
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM the associated % a.i. are examples, and are current at the time of EIS publication.
The trade names illustrate the formulations that may be used, but are not intended to limit the proposed IPM program to exclusive use of those formulations that are named in the table.
Other formulations of the listed active ingredients may be substituted, at the same rate of application described in the table.
The table presents application rates in terms of a.i. per acre or per tree, and will therefore remain applicable to any trade name or formulation of the listed active ingredients.
Summary: Chemical Pesticide Methods Â· Vegetation: herbicides, including dicamba, glyphosate, hexazinone, picloram, and triclopyr.
Â· Insects: insecticides, including acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, esfenvalerate, horticultural oil, permethrin, propargite, and SaferÂ® soap.
Â· Disease: a fungicide, chlorothalonil.
2.2.2.3 Prescribed Fire Controlled broadcast burning may be used to control one to two acres annually of vegetation along fence lines, roadsides, and irrigation ditches during the winter and early spring months.
This limited control method is very dependent on fuel condition, approved fire plans, smoke management windows, and available burn crews, and is therefore not a reliable method.
Pile burning is more reliable and effective as a tool to eliminate vegetation accumulated and consolidated from project work throughout the orchard over a several month period.
Once or twice each year (spring or early winter), one or two piles are usually burned at each orchard by BLM fire specialists.
Pile burning of insect-infested vegetation or cones once or populations by eliminating the habitat, which would allow insects.
Pile burning of vegetation with disease infections eliminates the infected material and reduces risk of spread located outside of the orchard units.
twice per year helps reduce insect the pupae to emerge in spring as adult is a sanitation method of control, which within the orchard; burn piles are
Prescribed fire may be used for removing vegetation in native species beds prior to planting.
High temperatures, created through the use of a propane-fueled flame wand, kill any existing herbaceous material, providing a weed-free bed for growing native plants, and quickly remove dead plant litter.
Prescribed fire may also be used to remove native grass straw after seed harvest or diseased native grasses in native species beds.
Summary: Prescribed Fire Â· Vegetation: control of unwanted vegetation along fence lines, road sides, and irrigation ditches; pile burning of cut/cleared vegetation.
Â· Insects: pile burning of insect-damaged branches and trees, burning cones from sanitation collections and insect-damaged cones.
Â· Disease: pile burning of infected branches and trees, burning grass straw in bed rows in the native plant gardens.
2.2.2.4 Cultural Methods, Including Manual and Mechanical Methods Cultural control refers to the use of methods that make the habitat less suitable for pests or prevents, suppresses, or removes them.
Cultural methods include both manual and mechanical control methods.
Cultural methods for vegetation include hand-pulling or using non-powered and powered hand tools and machinery to cut and clear vegetation.
Chapte 2 -- 12
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action Â· Orchards are also thinned by removing whole trees to allow remaining trees to be more thrifty and healthy.
Roguing is a form of thinning process that allows trees of greater importance to remain in the orchard by removing the less desirable trees in quality or quantity.
These forms of vegetation (whole tree) control reduce competition for light to tree crown surfaces, increase crown surface area for cone production, and make water and nutrients more available to the remaining trees.
Â· Tree crown vegetation control is done by specialized manual pruning of branches with hand pruners, handsaws, and power saws for specific objectives.
In the early years of growth when the bark is thin and subject to sun and heat damage, a tree's lower stem branches are progressively removed, leaving more branches on the west and south sides of the lower stem for sun protection.
As a tree grows larger and the bark becomes thicker and more resistant to sun damage, all of the lower limbs (rootstock) are removed up to the graft union so that the desirable grafted portion of the tree above the union is left.
Later, as tree crowns become wider, more limbs above the union are removed to provide stem access for installation of permanent identification tags, and access for tractors and trucks traveling along the tree rows.
Cultural pruning methods are also used sometimes to remove the upper portions of tree crowns (cutting the top out of the tree) for crown height management to limit the height of cone production.
Â· Mulch mats made of nylon or fabric mesh weave are used around newly planted seedlings in the orchard to control competing vegetation and reduce moisture loss around the tree roots.
The mats are three to four feet square and are held to the ground with steel pins in each corner.
The tree protrudes through a slit in the center of the mat.
The mats, which are effective for many years, later break down naturally or are removed to prevent girdling of the tree.
Mulch mats are also used to control vegetation around irrigation risers and other items, which can be affected by vegetation growth.
Â· Hand pulling, hand cutting, or hand grubbing with hand tools are methods sometimes used to remove noxious weeds after chemical control, or for some weeds before sprouting and chemical control, or in lieu of chemical control in some sensitive locations and small densities.
Â· Hand pulling or hand troweling, instead of power tools, is used to remove vegetation within two feet of orchard tree stems, to prevent damage to trees and to irrigation systems.
In the spring, when the irrigation season is just beginning, vegetation is removed or displaced (flattened) manually at the base of trees near and around irrigation emitters to allow irrigation spray patterns to be more effective.
This process is repeated in July in a more thorough and complete manner to provide effective irrigation to the trees during the critical drought months of the season.
Â· Mechanical control methods typically involve the use of machinery to physically cut or remove vegetation.
Several mechanical methods are used at Provolt and Sprague, including the use of tractors for mowing.
A variety of lawn and garden tractors and larger agricultural tractors are used with 6-ft, 12-ft, and 15-ft wide rotary mowers.
Vegetation is mowed two to three times per season, generally in May/June and July/August, depending on fire risk.
A late summer mowing is always necessary to provide good access for cone harvest contractors and orchard staff.
Â· Vegetation in areas not accessible by tractors is controlled using power string trimmers.
These areas include gate openings, along some fence lines in high-risk fire areas, around buildings and other structures, along irrigation ditches, and special use areas.
Â· Brush cutter machines (large cutting head and articulating arm mounted on tractor) are used at times by orchard staff to cut vegetation along roadsides and other areas where it is difficult to control vegetation with other equipment.
Other heavy equipment (such as a dozer or backhoe, or agricultural tractor with attached roto tiller or disk) may also be used to completely remove (rather than cut) vegetation in some development or renovation project work.
Chapter 2 -- 13
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM Â· Another method of removing accumulated vegetation from the orchard is chipping with large tub grinders and marketing the chips for electrical energy development.
This method is done with cost share agreements or by contract, generally when 100 tons or more of biomass is accumulated from roguing and thinning operations in the spring.
There are many cultural methods that can help prevent insect damage: Â· Tree crowns are hand-pruned and thinned of excess branches during the to open the tree crown to air and light, and reduce the insect habitat.
All during the dormant season to allow the tree to heal the pruning wounds, damaging insects to stressed or wounded trees, which may occur during season.
dormant winter season pruning work is done and avoid attracting the active growing
Â· Graft unions of new grafts and scoring wounds (a bark cutting technique to improve graft compatibility) are protected with grafting wax or spray seal to help protect against cone worm damage.
This work is also done in the dormant season of late winter to allow healing of the wounds by the tree, and avoid the active flights of insects.
Â· Selective pruning of dead or dying branches, shaping the tree after removal of the infested terminal branches, and destroying infested branches can minimize the effects of twig weevil infestations.
Â· Sanitation is a cultural method used to remove insects and insect habitat from the orchard.
Insect damaged branches are pruned and damaged trees are cut down and removed as soon as possible after symptoms appear.
Â· Cone sanitation is a cultural method of cone and seed insect control.
Insect damaged cones or cones not harvested from trees for seed production are all removed from trees, collected into bags, and burned.
This method of control does not protect the seed crop currently on the trees; rather it reduces insect larvae, pupae, and habitat and may reduce the following year 's insect populations and damage to those cones and seeds.
Â· Occasionally, insect pupae that are large and noticeable, and are known to be of exotic or damaging insects, are hand picked from trees in the orchard and destroyed by orchard employees.
Examples of these insects are the Cecropia moth (Hyalophora cecropia).
Â· At Sprague, occasional sawfly outbreaks occur in isolated small locations, seriously affecting small numbers of young trees (5- to 10-ft tall) in one or more sites at any one time.
These trees are heavily infested with foliage-eating larvae and can be seriously injured or killed.
The current method of control is to shake the trees to dislodge the larvae to the ground, followed by foot stomping to kill the larvae; many other larvae are eaten then on the ground by birds.
Â· Another very successful method of insect control at Sprague is to manually place cotton bags (the size of 25-lb flour sacks--1 ft wide by 2 ft long) over developing conelets in the early spring of the second year of cone development.
The bags, which are attached to the tree limbs with twist ties above the conelets, are fine mesh cotton, which allows airflow but prevents insects from attacking the cones.
This preventative barrier method of insect control must be placed manually and is quite costly.
However, there are many benefits to this method, including effective insect control; an efficient method of seed collection, as seeds are collected in bags as cones open naturally in the fall; and a wide window of cone harvest since the bags act as collectors.
All tree crown-pruning work and thinning/roguing work is done in the October through March dormant season to reduce the risk of stress to the trees and the possible introduction of diseases.
Chapte 2 -- 14
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action Foliar or branch disease outbreaks on individual trees or small groups of trees can be treated by hand or mechanical pruning and tree removal, when necessary.
Cankers formed on branches can be removed with specialized pruning techniques to sanitize and isolate the infections.
The pruning work is a fairly successful direct control measure if the infections are noticed and treated promptly.
The pruned material is removed from the orchard and destroyed, normally by burning.
Sun scald and tree basal heat damage, especially of small or newly planted trees, is a serious risk during much of the year in southern Oregon.
Heat lesions or stem splitting of bark results in open wounds, dead tissue, and stress, which increase the opportunity for disease infections.
To control or reduce these disease conditions, mesh shade screens on wire frames are placed by hand on the south and west sides of small and newly planted trees.
Older trees with exposed and thin bark are hand painted with an elastic white paint on the south and west sides of the tree stem to reflect the sun rays and insulate from extreme heat.
For animal pests, particularly for such animals as gophers, skunks, porcupines, wild or runaway dogs and feral cats, live trapping and relocation or kill trapping are possible alternatives.
Control of western gray squirrels is the most serious issue in orchard animal control at Sprague.
The squirrel populations are currently reduced by the use of a pellet gun by orchard employees and a permit issued annually by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW).
In addition, the harvested cones in the fall of each year are protected from gray and ground squirrels while being stored in the cone storage building at Sprague.
The entire perimeter of the pole barn building is screened with chicken wire.
The wire also extends underground two feet for protection against tunneling.
Finally, beavers, another animal pest at Sprague, are live-trapped, or may be encouraged to move out of the orchard by lowering the lake's water level for several days.
For animal pests, deer and elk exclusion fencing can be used to reduce browsing damage.
The developed orchard lands at Sprague are protected with a seven-foot high chain link fence with barbed wire at the top, for a big game exclosure.
The orchard lands at Provolt are protected with an eight-foot high woven wire fence as a big game exclosure.
Rodents such as cover habitat in the orchard and pruned up at the of the orchard.
mice and voles, California ground squirrel, rabbits, and other animals require tall grass, under low tree limbs, or in thick edge areas.
To help reduce habitat in possible damage to facilities from the animals, the tree limbs in the orchard are base, and unwanted vegetation, especially blackberries, are removed at the edges
The orchard gates are often open during the day to provide access for employees, contractors, and other visitors for project work.
Occasionally deer will travel through the gates into the orchard and back out again but sometimes will stay inside and require manual removal, by walking (herding) the animals through the gates.
Tractor mowing of cover crop vegetation has many benefits.
Tall grass provides cover habitat for animals so grass is kept short throughout the orchard to reduce this habitat.
Summary: Cultural Control Methods Â· Vegetation: hand-pulling; pruning; thinning; hand tools to cut and grub; tractors with various blade attachments for mowing; gasoline-powered string trimmers; brush cutter machine mounted on tractor; chainsaw for cutting up thinned, rogued, dead/dying orchard trees; power pruner; wood chipper; chipping with large tub grinders and marketing the chips for energy development; mulch mats.
Â· Insects: pruning, thinning, shaping, use of grafting wax or spray seal on tree wounds, sanitation of damaged branches and trees, sanitation of insect-damaged cones and cones not harvested for seed production, hand-picking large and noticeable insect pupae.
Chapter 2 -- 15
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM Â· Disease: pruning, power saws to cut infected or dead trees, removal of diseased plants from the native plant gardens using a tractor and roto tiller, mesh shade screens to protect seedlings from heat damage, hand-painting older trees with exposed and thin bark to reflect the sun's rays and insulate from extreme heat.
Â· Animal pests: walking (herding) stray deer toward and out the gates; pruning tree limbs up at the base of the trees; removing unwanted vegetation, and mowing cover crop vegetation that would provide cover for small mammals; live trapping; lowering the lake's water level for several days to cause beavers to move out (Sprague); pellet gun to reduce western gray squirrel population (Sprague); screening buildings and under buildings to act as a barrier against western gray squirrel, skunks, and other animals (Sprague).
2.2.2.5 Other Control Methods Pheromone bait traps can attract and capture damaging insects.
Annual soil and foliar analyses results are used to develop fertilization plans to adjust soil pH levels and provide the necessary nutrients for adjustment toward zero deficiency.
Soil moisture is monitored to develop and adjust irrigation schedules during the season to provide sufficient water for plant functions.
These actions help orchard trees maintain the health and vigor necessary to resist adverse effects from insects and disease.
Application details for fertilizers are included in Table 2.2-1.
Summary: Other Methods Â· Insects: pheromone bait traps.
Â· Fertilization to promote overall tree health, cone production, and disease resistance.
2.3 Alternatives 2.3.1 General Description and Features Common to All Alternatives Four alternatives based on the pest management approaches described in Section 2.2.2 were identified and evaluated by BLM to address the need for a pest management program at the Medford District seed orchards, as follows: Â· Â· Â· Â· Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative A--Maximum Production IPM B--IPM with Environmental Protection Emphasis (Proposed Action) C--Non-Chemical Pest Management D--No Action: Continue Current Management Approach
There are several features common to all alternatives.
Pest management methods that are common to all alternatives are biological methods, cultural methods, prescribed burning, and other nonchemical-pesticide control methods.
Additional activities common to all alternatives include orchard management activities unrelated to pest management (see Section 2.1.2) and protection measures that would be associated with a given pest control method under any alternative in which it is included.
These protection measures are described in the following paragraphs.
Protection measures are intended to ensure the proper and safe application of pesticides at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards.
FIFRA requires pesticide manufacturers to register their chemicals with EPA, and list the allowable uses, application rates, and special restrictions on each pesticide's label.
The pesticides considered for use at Provolt and Sprague are all registered under FIFRA.
Application operations would comply with the label rates, uses, and handling instructions, in accordance with Federal law.
In addition, the following procedures would be designed and Chapte 2 -- 16
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action implemented by the seed orchards, and routinely observed in pesticide applications.
If output from the monitoring plan (see Appendix B) indicates that more protection is needed, these protection measures may be altered over the life of this IPM program to provide more (but not less) protection to workers, the public, the environment, and ecological resources:
Worker Protection Measures Â· Pesticide treatments would frequently be completed under contract by licensed pesticide applicators.
BLM would administer the contracts for compliance.
A Job Hazard Analysis for pesticide applications would be developed, providing a detailed description of the jobs and associated risks involved with pesticide use and application, and identifying requirements for personal safety equipment, training, and certification to perform specific tasks.
The seed orchards would develop a Pesticide Safety Plan.
Pesticide applications would be conducted in compliance with all aspects of EPA's Worker Protection Standard under FIFRA, including protection during applications, restricted entry intervals, personal protective equipment, notification of workers, decontamination supplies, emergency assistance, pesticide safety training and safety posters, and access to labeling and site-specific information.
All workers involved in pesticide applications would be required to participate in a pesticide exposure monitoring program.
Testing for cholinesterase inhibition would be conducted on BLM employees applying organophosphates.
Also, workers with declared hypersensitivity or who display symptoms of hypersensitivity to pesticides would not be assigned to application projects.
Material safety data sheets would be posted at storage facilities and made available to workers.
Appropriate protective clothing would be worn by all workers, as required by each pesticide's label.
All applicators would be trained and licensed; this training would be confirmed by the seed orchard manager.
For all application methods except spot treatments using hand-held application equipment, treated areas would not be re-entered until sprays have dried or until the stated label re-entry period has been met, unless protective clothing is worn and early re-entry is permitted by the label.
Â·
Â· Â·
Â·
Â· Â·
Â·
Â·
Public, Environmental, and Ecological Protection Measures Â· Â· Warning signs would be posted to discourage entry into treated areas.
Pesticides would be applied within the parameters of prescribed environmental conditions stated on the label.
Factors such as relative humidity, wind speed, and air temperature would be considered to determine the timing of applications that would minimize the potential for off-target drift.
Equipment used for pesticide transport, mixing, and application would be properly maintained to avoid leaking pesticides into water or soil.
Pesticides would be mixed and equipment cleaned in areas protected (e.g., paved and bermed, or on a portable bermed mixing pad) from the potential for runoff to surface waters or leaching to groundwater in the case of a spill.
Chapter 2 -- 17
Â·
Â·
Â·
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM Â· Chemical weed control within 20 feet of perennial streams would be limited to spot hand applications.
Applications would be timed, to the extent predictable by weather forecasts, to not coincide or closely precede a storm event that could result in substantial runoff.
Drift cards would be used to indicate when spray is heading toward a riparian zone, and spraying would cease if this danger seems likely.
Temperatures would be monitored carefully.
If possible, spraying would be conducted during the early morning or late evening, allowing foliage to dry before pollinators become active.
Orchard fields would be mowed prior to insecticide applications, to remove floral components on ground cover that would attract pollinators, such as bees (if pollinators are active).
Two special status1 plant species are known to occur at Sprague in riparian stream buffers, dry drainage ditches, and other low, seasonably wet spots:
Â·
Â·
Â· Â·
Â·
Â·
* Bureau sensitive species: slender meadow-foam (Limnanthes gracilis ssp. gracilis); and * Bureau sensitive species: coral-seeded allocarya (Plagiobothrys figuratus var. corallicarpa).
Herbicide-free buffer zones would be implemented for the protection of each of these special status plant species.
Alternatively, mechanical control of nearby weeds could be accomplished through mowing.
Â· The monitoring program, detailed in Appendix B to this EIS, would be implemented as described for chemical pesticide applications.
2.3.2 Alternative A--Maximum Production IPM Under this alternative, the primary goal is the maximum production of seeds and plants with a very low level of acceptable losses.
The seed orchard manager for Provolt and Sprague would have all the methods of pest management listed in Section 2.2.2 available for use, including all identified biological, chemical, prescribed fire, cultural, and other pest control methods.
An effective IPM strategy for all orchard pests would be used under this alternative, including monitoring pest levels and treating if action thresholds are exceeded.
However, the primary management objective, which would be reflected in the annual IPM plan (see Figure 2.2-1), would be to maximize seed production for annual BLM and cooperator seed needs by aggressively controlling cone and seed insects and other limiting factors.
The most effective insect control measures would be implemented, to maximize seed yield and reduce damage to the seed crops with low acceptable seed losses, emphasizing production above other less-effective control methods and considerations, with a low threshold for initiating treatment.
2.3.3 Alternative B--IPM with Environmental Protection Emphasis (Proposed Action) Alternative B is BLM's preferred alternative.
An effective IPM strategy for all orchard pests would be used under this alternative, including monitoring pest levels and treating if action thresholds are exceeded.
1
Special status species are species which are proposed for listing, officially listed as threatened or endangered, or are candidates for listing as threatened or endangered under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act; those listed by a state in a category such as threatened or endangered implying potential endangerment or extinction; and those designated by each BLM State Director as sensitive.
Chapte 2 -- 18
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action Under this alternative, the seed orchard manager would have access to the full list of pest management methods identified in Alternative A, with the exceptions listed below.
These limitations were identified by reviewing the results of the quantitative risk assessment (summarized in Appendix C), considering the scoping comments, and responding to recommendations made by district interdisciplinary team members.
In addition, some chemicals would likely not be used or seldom used at both seed orchards because of ecological protection limitations and considerations.
These chemicals include acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, propargite, hexazinone, and picloram.
These limitations, listed below, address each risk identified during the risk assessment for Alternative A (summarized in Table 4.6-2 for human health and Table 4.7-2 for wildlife and aquatic species).
Each quantitative limitation was calculated by varying the application scenario parameters in the model spreadsheet until the risk was lowered to the acceptable level.
Parameters that were varied were those that the seed orchard manager can limit when approving the application, such as application rate, frequency, length of time to re-entry, total area or number of trees treated, and distance from area assumed to receive drift in the risk assessment scenario.
The resulting risks correspond in each case to the negligible risk levels for human health, terrestrial wildlife, and aquatic species (see Section 4.6.1 for human health risk methodology and Section 4.7.1 for non-target species risk methodology).
Limitations to protect worker health: Â· An individual worker would not mix, load, and apply more than 3.75 lb a.i. of diazinon using a high-pressure hydraulic sprayer in any one day.
Â· An individual worker would not mix, load, and apply more than 9 lb a.i. of diazinon using a hydraulic sprayer with a hand-held wand in any one day.
Â· A closed mixing system would be used to prepare dimethoate for application by hydraulic sprayer with hand-held wand.
Â· Dimethoate would not be applied using a backpack sprayer.
Â· No more than 0.3 lb a.i. of permethrin would be applied by any individual worker using a backpack sprayer in one day.
Â· No more than 0.7 lb a.i. of propargite would be applied by any individual worker using a backpack sprayer in one day.
Â· No more than 0.61 lb a.i. of dicamba would be applied by any individual worker using a backpack sprayer in one day.
Â· No more than 6.7 lb a.i. hexazinone would be applied by any individual worker using a backpack sprayer in one day.
Â· Irrigation system maintenance personnel would not work in an orchard unit treated with chlorpyrifos at the maximum label application of 2 lb a.i. per acre (estimated 0.04 lb a.i. per tree) until at least 12 days post-application.
Â· Irrigation system maintenance personnel would not work in an orchard unit treated with diazinon at the maximum label application of 0.075 lb a.i. per tree until at least 26 days postapplication.
Chapter 2 -- 19
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM
Limitations in response to scoping concerns: Â· Chemical herbicides would not be used to control blackberries along the common boundary between the Provolt Seed Orchard and the Provolt Grange.
Â· At Provolt, insecticides for cone and seed insect control would not be applied using a highpressure hydraulic sprayer to the two rows of trees nearest and directly adjacent to any public or private road or private property, to provide a buffer from drift.
This would apply to the north and east sides of unit 6; the east sides of units 8, 10, and 12; the south sides of units 1, 2, 3, 14 and 17; the west sides of units 7, 9, 11, 16, and 17; the north sides of units 1 and 4; and the south and west sides of unit 15.
Â· At Sprague, insecticides for cone and seed insect control would not be applied using a highpressure hydraulic sprayer to the two rows of trees nearest and directly adjacent to any public or private road, private property, or railroad right-of-way, to provide a buffer from drift.
This would apply to the west side of unit 42, the north sides of units 44 and 45, the west and south sides of unit 52, the west and north sides of unit 53, the north and east sides of unit 54, and the southeast side of ponderosa pine unit 44.
Limitations to protect ecological resources: Â· Chlorpyrifos would not be applied within 40 feet of a bird box (unless the bird box is empty and covered with a plastic bag during spraying) or the edge of a managed orchard unit when a high-pressure hydraulic sprayer is used, or within 25 feet of a bird box (unless the bird box is empty and covered with a plastic bag during spraying) or unit edge when applied with a hydraulic sprayer with hand-held wand (these are the distances associated with no drift from the respective application methods).2 It would not be applied to more than 166 trees at a rate of 0.02 lb a.i. per tree (nor any combination of number of trees and application rate that is more than 3.32 lb a.i. total applied) in any 12-acre area within a 14-day period.3 Diazinon would not be applied within 40 feet of a bird box (unless the bird box is empty and covered with a plastic bag during spraying) or the edge of a managed orchard unit when a high-pressure hydraulic sprayer is used, or within 25 feet of a bird box (unless the bird box is empty and covered with a plastic bag during spraying) or unit edge when applied with a hydraulic sprayer with hand-held wand (these are the distances associated with no drift from the respective application methods).4 It would not be applied to more than one tree per acre within an 11-day period.5 Dimethoate would not be applied within 25 feet of a bird box (unless the bird box is empty and covered with a plastic bag during spraying) or the edge of a managed orchard unit (the distance associated with no drift from the proposed application methods).6 It would not be applied to more than three trees at a rate of 0.13 lb a.i. per tree (nor any combination of trees and application rate that is more than 0.39 lb a.i. total applied) in any one-acre area within a sevenday period.7

Â· At Provolt, to decrease the potential for drift or runoff to surface water, esfenvalerate would not be applied to trees in the two rows of orchard trees nearest and directly adjacent to Williams Creek in units adjacent to the creek: units 1, 5, 7, 9, and 17; and the two rows of trees nearest the two irrigation ditches in units 5, 7, 12, 14, 15, and 16.
These trees would then act as an additional shield against drift toward the surface water, as well as increase the buffer against overland runoff containing pesticide residues by as much as 200% in some areas.

Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action Â· At Provolt, insecticides would not be applied using a high-pressure hydraulic sprayer to the two rows of trees nearest and directly adjacent to any open water, to provide a buffer from drift or runoff.
(At Sprague, the waterways are intermittent and the existing natural vegetation buffer areas are high, thick, and wide, so no additional restriction is specified for that seed orchard.)
How is Alternative B Different from Alternative A? Under Alternative B, all of the same pest control methods are available to the seed orchard manager as under Alternative A. However, Alternative B contains specific limitations (see list above) on certain aspects of chemical pesticide use to provide added protection to human health and the environment.
Commonly, during the preparation of an EIS, the analysis of impacts occurs wholly during the EIS development process.
In the case of the proposed IPM program at Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards, a quantitative risk assessment of the proposed chemical pesticides and fertilizers was completed before development of the EIS alternatives.
The assumptions made during this risk assessment correspond to the pesticide application details of Alternative A.
The conclusions of this assessment, and the interaction among the interdisciplinary team members during the assessment, directly resulted in developing a new alternative--Alternative B--that addresses all the predicted risks in the risk assessment scenarios, as well as protects resources based on these experts' site-specific knowledge of overall potential chemical transport pathways at the seed orchards.
What are Limitations, Protection Measures, and Mitigation Measures? These three concepts may seem similar, but they have distinct definitions within this EIS: Limitations are the list of exceptions in Section 2.3.3 that distinguish the details of potential pesticide applications under Alternative B from those under Alternative A. These limitations were designed by the interdisciplinary team preparing this EIS to address predicted risks, respond to scoping concerns, and provide additional environmental protection.
Protection measures are best management practices (BMPs), including BMPs for water quality protection under the Clean Water Act,1 that would be implemented during any use of chemical pesticides by Provolt or Sprague, regardless of the alternative selected.
Protection measures are listed in Section 2.3.1.
Mitigation measures are defined by CEQ (40 CFR 1508.20) as (a) avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; (b) minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation; (c) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment; (d) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action; or (e) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments.
Mitigation measures are not specifically included in an alternative, but are additional measures in response to the potential environmental impact(s) that an alternative may have.
Potential mitigation measures for the alternatives in this EIS are listed in Section 4.12, and, if needed, would be specifically identified in the ROD to correspond to the selected alternative.
_______________ 1
BMPs in relation to water pollution are defined by EPA as "methods that have been determined to be the most effective, practical means of preventing or reducing pollution from non-point sources."
2.3.4 Alternative C--Non-Chemical Pest Management Alternative C would allow the seed orchard manager to use only the biological, prescribed fire, cultural, and other non-chemical-pesticide methods listed under Alternative A.
No chemical pesticides would be permitted.
Chapter 2 -- 21
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM
2.3.5 Alternative D--No Action: Continue Current Management Approach Alternative D would allow continuation of the current management system, which is the use of all non-chemical-pesticide pest control practices at the seed orchard, as well as the use of chemicals on a specific case-by-case basis.
All biological, prescribed fire, cultural, and other non-chemical-pesticide methods would be used and expanded beyond present use in accordance with current procedures.
When a specific need is identified for a chemical pesticide, the action would be reviewed to determine whether it is encompassed by an existing NEPA document.
For example, weed control projects could be within the scope of the Northwest Area Noxious Weed Control Program EIS and Supplemental EIS, and the EIS for Vegetation Treatment on BLM Lands - Thirteen Western States.
In addition, a project-specific EA was prepared for the 1999 through 2002 use of glyphosate at Sprague and the 2001 and 2002 use of glyphosate at Provolt to spot-treat noxious weeds.
Section 1.4.1 provides more information on existing NEPA documents related to pest management.
When specific proposed pesticide applications are not within the scope of an existing EA or EIS, another NEPA document would be prepared.
The future anticipated use of chemical pesticides under this alternative would be as follows: Â· The continued use of glyphosate or triclopyr, one to two applications per year at both orchards, as spot sprays for noxious weed control.
Â· Cone and seed insect control at Provolt would be proposed as esfenvalerate applications, one to two times per year in 15 to 18 orchard units, approximately every other year or when harvestable cone crops occur in the orchard.
The use of chemical insecticides for controlling cone and seed insects at Sprague is not likely to be proposed under this alternative.
2.3.6 Alternative Considered But Not Further Analyzed During the scoping process, one member of the public suggested planting more crop trees than necessary to allow for some loss to pests, which was interpreted as a request to consider no pest management at all.
This is not a viable alternative for several reasons.
First, this approach could lead to a significant loss of the crop trees in the production units if disease were to occur.
Secondly, orchard research has shown that approximately 70% of the seed crop could be lost if no pest management were practiced (Schowalter et al. 1985).
To partially offset the effects of cone and seed insects and decreased tree vigor due to disease, it would be necessary to plant production trees in fields that are currently fallow, as the commentor suggested.
This solution would require the seed orchards and their cooperators to accept an estimated 10-year reduction in seed production, which is the time that would be required for the newly planted trees to produce collectable seed.
This decrease in production could also result in delays in reforestation projects caused by potential seed shortages, or reduced forest growth resulting from the use of genetically inferior seed from other sources.
In addition, a more intensive planting regime on seed orchard lands, with no pest management of any kind, would allow the orchard grounds to become a "reservoir" for insects, disease, noxious weeds, and animal pests that would spread to neighboring public and private lands--effectively, becoming a threat and nuisance to the neighbors, particularly those who cultivate crops of their own.
2.4 Approval Of New Products And Technologies It is likely that, over the life of the proposed IPM program, BLM seed orchard personnel will become aware of chemicals or non-chemical control methods that are currently available but were not described in this EIS, or that represent new technologies not currently available or practiced.
This section describes how BLM would ensure compliance with U.S. laws (including NEPA) and regulations, and evaluate these new approaches for inclusion in the seed orchard's pest management plans, in terms of both their efficacy and their potential environmental impacts.
This
Chapte 2 -- 22
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action information applies both to full-scale use as a control method, as well as to field research projects investigating the potential for larger applications.
This approach includes descriptions of how new chemical products or technologies would be examined for consideration by BLM, what data would be relied upon to assess a product or technology's effectiveness for use on public lands, what data would be relied upon to conduct human health hazard and risk assessment, and the level of NEPA documentation required to support a decision to use or not use a product or technology.
2.4.1 Identification of New Chemical Products and Technologies The seed orchard manager and employees may become aware of new pest control products and technologies through three general mechanisms: professional networking, technical research and publications, and vendor marketing.
Networking Participation in professional networks is the principal method for staying current on new pest control approaches, and yields information on the technical, regulatory, efficacy, and environmental aspects of methods, both those in the development phase and those currently on the market.
The primary professional association for BLM seed orchard managers in Oregon is the Northwest Seed Orchard Managers Association (NWSOMA), and particularly its Northwest Pest Management Committee.
For nursery and greenhouse managers, the primary professional associations are the Western Forest and Conservation Nursery Association and the Intermountain Container Seedling Growers Association.
The Southwest Oregon Forest Insect and Disease Service Center is a group of U.S. Forest Service pathologists and entomologists that provide forest insect and disease technical assistance, field consultation, modeling, risk assessments, and historical information to Federal resource managers in southwest Oregon.
A field service center is located near BLM's Medford District seed orchards at the Forest Service's J. Herbert Stone Nursery in Central Point.
Similar services are also available in the Forest Service's regional office in Portland.
Useful information can also be obtained by staying in contact with other non-regional professional networks with similar goals, such as the Southern Seed Orchard Pest Management Subcommittee of the Southern Forest Tree Improvement Committee (part of the North Carolina State University Industry Cooperative Tree Improvement Association).
Similarly, the British Columbia Seed Orchard Association, which often has formal interactions and collaborations with NWSOMA, is another professional network focusing on seed orchard management.
Technical Research and Publications The U.S. Forest Service conducts extensive research activities that support tree improvement and re-forestation activities.
The web page USDA/FS Research Publications (http://216.48.37.142/) provides a search function that indexes Forest Service research publications, by keyword or by research station.8 The Forest Service's Reforestation Nurseries and Genetics Resource web page (http://www.rngr.fs.fed.us/) includes current information on seed orchard and tree nursery practices and pest management.
The IR-4 Ornamentals Research Program, organized by the state land grant universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), assists in collecting data that can be used to add minor crop (including seed orchard tree species) uses to existing chemical and biological pesticide registrations.
The program's activities are described in detail at its web site (http:// pestdata.ncsu.edu/ir-4/).
8 This and other Internet citations (uniform resource locators, or URLs) in this EIS were accurate at the time of publication.
However, websites change frequently due to changes in data availability or reorganization of information, and the cited URLs may not work in the future.
If this occurs, "backing up" to a less specific web address or using an Internet search function may allow retrieval of the information.
Chapter 2 -- 23
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM The Washington State Commission on Pesticide Registration is a state-funded regional program with a similar mandate (http://wscpr.org/).
Vendor Marketing Vendors of pest control technologies, including chemical company representatives, occasionally contact BLM's seed orchards to introduce new products.
These contacts may come in the form of mailed brochures or advertisements, or telephone contacts to request a visit to the seed orchard.
From time to time, members of the public who are interested in various approaches to pest management send information to the seed orchard manager describing these methods.
As with pest control methods identified through other avenues, if the seed orchard manager determines that the approach may have some utility for the seed orchard's needs, a product demonstration or additional information may be requested.
2.4.2 Assessment of Effectiveness The seed orchard manager would be the one to judge whether a previously unconsidered pest control product or technology is likely to be effective in meeting the specific seed orchard's pest control needs.
The decision would be based on details such as previous use reports at other sites and their outcomes, availability, cost, expected effectiveness compared to any currently used methods, training and personnel requirements, factors that could limit efficacy, and any other relevant factors (including hazards and risks--see Section 2.4.3 below).
Any new chemical or biological pesticide considered for use by the seed orchards must be registered under FIFRA, which requires product performance data relating to its effectiveness.
This requirement was designed "to ensure that pesticide products will control the pests listed on the label and that unnecessary pesticide exposure to the environment will not occur as a result of the use of ineffective products" [40 CFR 158.202(i)].
Therefore, any new pesticide registered under FIFRA is expected to be generally effective for the labeled uses.
To further assess the potential for site-specific effectiveness prior to an actual application in the seed orchard, the seed orchard manager would investigate its use through professional networks, technical publications, and/or research reports, such as those described in the previous section.
For a pest control technology that is not required to be registered under FIFRA, the avenues of research described in the previous section would be the likely initial means for discovering its advantages and limitations over currently used methods.
This could pertain to cultural control practices, tools or equipment, or other means that are not considered pesticides under the purview of FIFRA.
2.4.3 Assessment of Hazards and Risks As stated in the previous section, BLM only uses pesticide products that are registered under FIFRA.
Therefore, for any chemical or biological pesticide that may be considered for use in the seed orchard, there would exist a body of EPA-reviewed toxicological, environmental fate, and ecotoxicity data that were submitted by the pesticide manufacturer to support its registration application.
These data can be used to conduct a site-specific assessment of the potential human health and ecological risks from the pesticide's use at the seed orchard, including the following components: Â· Identification of potential use patterns, including target pest(s), formulation, application method(s), locations to be treated, application rate, and anticipated frequency.
Â· Review of chemical hazards relevant to human health risk assessment, including systemic and reproductive effects, skin and eye irritation, dermal absorption, allergic hypersensitivity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and endocrine disruption.
Chapte 2 -- 24
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action Â· Estimation of exposure to workers applying the chemical or re-entering a treated area.
Â· Environmental fate and transport, including drift, leaching to groundwater, and runoff to surface streams and ponds.
Â· Estimation of exposure to members of the public.
Â· Review of available ecotoxicity data, including hazards to mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.
Â· Estimation of exposure to terrestrial and aquatic wildlife species.
Â· Characterization of risk to human health and wildlife.
If the available toxicity or ecotoxicity data are inconclusive, or substantial disagreement occurs among the results of technical studies that could affect the potential risk conclusions for the chemical, BLM could conduct a formal peer review of the available scientific information to develop a consensus as to the endpoint(s) in question.
The peer review process would include the following steps, based largely on EPA's peer review process (EPA 2000): Â· BLM would conduct a literature search of studies submitted to EPA, studies published in professional journals, and research projects conducted by other government agencies or universities.
The identified literature would be indexed and abstracted.
Â· A peer review committee would be formed, consisting of reviewers with recognized technical expertise that bears on the subject matter under discussion, who represent a balanced range of technically legitimate points of view, and who do not have any real or perceived bias or conflict of interest.
The peer reviewers would be supplied with their charge, the results of the literature review, and a description of the issue at hand.
Â· The input of each reviewer would be sent to BLM.
If the results of the peer review are not consistent at this point, a working session would be convened, in which the peer reviewers would come together to discuss the technical aspects of the questions and attempt to reach a consensus.
The details of the peer review process would be determined by the question to be answered and the nature of the controversy.
To the extent they are relevant, the guidelines and processes in EPA's Peer Review Handbook (EPA 2000) would be followed.
For assessment of the hazards and risks from non-pesticide methods (biological controls, cultural controls, and other methods), BLM would review the potential for impacts to worker health and safety, public health and safety, and special status species and their habitat.
Limited-scale field trials could assist in identifying potential hazards from a non-pesticide method under consideration, as well as in determining the effectiveness of any new approach.
2.4.4 NEPA Documentation The potential use of new technologies or products for pest control in the seed orchard would require a review to ensure compliance with NEPA.
The review would follow the process outlined in the BLM NEPA Handbook (H-1790-1), Chapter 1 (BLM 1988), and would consist of the basic steps described below and outlined in Figure 2.4-1.
Step 1.
Conduct a CX Review The first step in this review is to determine whether the new action is within the scope of a Department of Interior or BLM CX (516 DM 2, Appendix 1; and 516 DM 11.5, respectively) (DOI
Chapter 2 -- 25
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM 1980).
These two lists constitute List C, as identified in Figure 2.4-1.
Based on an initial review of this list, there appear to be only two CXs, both within the Forestry areas on the BLM list, that have the potential to cover a new technology or product relating to seed orchard operations (516 DM 11.5 c (1) and (3)): Â· Land cultivation and silvicultural activities (excluding herbicides) in forest tree nurseries, seed orchards, and progeny test sites.
Â· Seeding or reforestation of timber sales or burn areas where no chaining is done, no pesticides are used, and there is no conversion of timber type or conversion of non-forest to forest land.
Specific reforestation activities covered include: seeding and seedling plantings, shading, tubing (browse protection), paper mulching, bud caps, ravel protection, application of nontoxic big game repellant, spot scalping, rodent trapping, fertilization of seed trees, fenced construction around out-planting sites, and collection of pollen, scions and cones.
Therefore, some non-pesticide methods could be within the scope of an existing CX.
The CX review actually involves three steps: (1) ensure conformance with existing land use plan; (2) identify potential CX--see above; and (3) review the current list of exceptions to CX at 516 DM 2, Appendix 2.
If the new action is within the scope of a CX, and none of the exceptions applies, the CX review would be documented and then no further action would be required.
If a CX was not identified or one or more of the exceptions were met, then BLM would proceed to Step 2.
Step 2.
Review Existing EAs and EISs The following types of existing NEPA documents would be reviewed to determine whether any have fully covered the use of the proposed new product or technology: BLM NEPA Documents (List A) Â· This seed orchard-specific IPM EIS. Â· EISs associated with the District RMP or Plan amendments.
Â· Programmatic documents such as the EIS for Vegetation Treatments, Watersheds and Wildlife Habitats on Public Lands Administered by the BLM in the Western United States, Including Alaska (currently in preparation).
Â· Any seed orchard-specific EAs that have been prepared for pest management or operations.
Â· NEPA documents prepared by other Federal agencies, with BLM as a cooperating agency.
Other Agency NEPA Documents (List B) Â· NEPA documents for which BLM was not listed as a cooperating agency, but for which the scope is relevant to evaluation of the proposed pest management method.
Possible source agencies could include the Forest Service, National Park Service, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the military services.
Generally, previously conditions significant public of a existing NEPA documents may be used when: (1) a current proposed action was proposed and analyzed (or is part of an earlier proposal that was analyzed); (2) resource and other relevant circumstances have not changed significantly, and there is no new information germane to the proposed action; and (3) there is no suggestion by the significant new and appropriate alternative (BLM 2001).

Chapter 2 -- 27
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM The review would focus on the following questions to determine whether the existing document(s) satisfy NEPA analysis requirements for the proposed new pest management method (BLM 2001): Â· Is the current proposed action substantially the same action (or is a part of an action) as previously analyzed? Â· Is the range of alternatives analyzed in the existing NEPA document(s) appropriate with respect to the current proposed action, given current environmental concerns, interests, resource values, and circumstances? Â· Is the existing analysis adequate and are the conclusions adequate in light of any new information or circumstances (including, for example, riparian proper functioning condition [PFC] reports; rangeland health standards assessments; Unified Watershed Assessment categorizations; inventory and monitoring data; most recent Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries lists of threatened, endangered, proposed, and candidate species; most recent BLM lists of special status species)? Can you reasonably conclude that all new information and all new circumstances are insignificant with regard to analysis of the proposed action? Â· Do the methodology and analytical approach used in the existing NEPA document(s) continue to be appropriate for the current proposed action? Â· Are the direct and indirect effects of the current proposed action substantially unchanged from those identified in t
Reliance on existing NEPA documents requires the establishment of an administrative record that clearly shows a "hard look" has been taken at whether new circumstances, new information, or environmental impacts not previously anticipated or analyzed warrant new analysis or supplementation of existing analyses, and whether the impact analysis supports the proposed action.
The review must be conducted through an interdisciplinary process, and the resulting documentation must adequately address the criteria included in the worksheet contained in BLM (2001).
If existing NEPA documentation is found to be adequate, this must be documented on the worksheet, which must also include a signed conclusion statement.
Approval of the proposed action requires a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) decision document.
If existing NEPA documentation is found to be adequate, but BLM is not formally a cooperating agency on the document, then BLM would adopt the document to comply with NEPA; adoption would be in accordance with the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 1506.3.
If existing NEPA documentation was determined to be inadequate, completion of the worksheet is not required and either the proposal would be rejected or BLM would proceed to Step 3.
Step 3.
Prepare a New NEPA Document This step can be further broken down into two sub-steps: (a) what level of NEPA review is required (EA or EIS); and (b) can portions of an existing document(s) be used in preparation of the new NEPA document?
Chapte 2 -- 28
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action To determine the level of NEPA review needed, the action should be compared to the actions typically requiring preparation of an EIS (516 DM 11.4).
Depending on the outcome, it may be appropriate to tier to, supplement, or incorporate by reference parts or all of existing document(s) as part of the document preparation process: Â· Tiering (40 CFR 1508.28) could be used to prepare new more specific or more narrow environmental documents (such as an EA for the proposed activity) without duplicating relevant parts of previously prepared, more general or broader documents (such as the IPM EIS).
Tiering is mostly used to avoid unnecessary paperwork.
Documents can be tiered only if decisions made in the new document would not change or modify the decision(s) of the more general document.
Â· Supplementing (40 CFR 1502.9c) is most often used to address alternatives not previously analyzed and may lead to a new decision.
In this instance, a supplemental EIS (SEIS) could be prepared to the IPM EIS.
Supplemental documents are generally prepared when there is a substantial change in the proposed action that is relevant to environmental concerns; that is, if there are significant new circumstances or facts relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on proposed action or impacts that were not addressed in existing analysis.
If the existing IPM EIS is supplemented, the same standard procedural and documentation requirements for EISs are followed (see Chapter 5 of BLM Handbook), except that additional scoping is optional.
In addition, the SEIS must identify the EIS being supplemented and explain the relationship to the prior analysis early in the text.
Further, the SEIS should identify changes in the proposed project and/or significant new information or changed circumstances that necessitate preparation of the supplement.
Â· Incorporating by reference (40 CFR 1502.21) is a technique used to avoid redundancies in analysis and to reduce the bulk of a NEPA document.
An EA or EIS must identify the documents that are incorporated by reference and indicate where they are available for public review.
Relevant portions of the incorporated analysis must be referenced by page number, and summarized in the EA or EIS to the extent necessary to provide the decisionmaker and public with an understanding of significance of the referenced material to the current analysis.
The new NEPA document must be able to stand alone.
Preparation of a new EA would follow the procedures outlined in the BLM NEPA Handbook, Chapter 4.
Preparation of a new EIS or SEIS would follow the procedures outlined in the BLM NEPA Handbook, Chapter 5 (including, where appropriate, tiering, supplementing, and incorporating by reference, as noted above).
The EA process would end in issuance of a FONSI or a determination of the need to prepare an EIS.
The EIS process would end with issuance of a ROD.
2.5 Ongoing And Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions In Study Area Implementing the proposed action or an alternative at Provolt or Sprague would be concurrent with other actions at the orchard and adjacent lands; these actions could contribute to cumulative impacts to some resources.
Both orchards plan only routine operations, and expect no construction or other unusual activities that would contribute to cumulative impacts.
Routine operations at Provolt include irrigation ditch maintenance activities, such as the use of herbicides to prevent vegetation from impeding water flow (BLM 2002).
Lands adjacent to Provolt are used primarily for rural residences and agriculture, including corn, grains, hay, pasture, and dairy operations.
Some or all of the farm operations could include applications of agricultural chemicals, and some rural residents may use yard chemicals.
No major construction or development projects are planned at this time.
There are no other activities known to occur on adjacent properties that would contribute to cumulative impacts (BLM 2002).
Chapter 2 -- 29
Draft EIS--Horning Seed Orchard IPM The areas surrounding Sprague include rural residences, and woodlands that are gradually being rezoned to residential use.
Isolated residential construction, with associated water well installation, is occurring, but no large-scale developments are planned.
There are no other activities known to occur on adjacent properties that would contribute to cumulative impacts (BLM 2002).
2.6 Summary Of Environmental Impacts By Alternative Areas of potential concern for the proposed action and alternatives were identified based on input from BLM interdisciplinary team members, consultation with Federal and state agencies, scoping comments, and comparisons with similar activities.
The potential impacts were evaluated and are described in Chapter 4.
As defined in CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA, determining whether an environmental impact is "significant" requires consideration of both context and intensity.
In the resourcespecific subsections of Chapter 4 of this EIS, the criteria used to define each impact's significance are described under the sub-heading "Analysis Approach and Assumptions."
Table 2.6-1 summarizes the environmental impacts for each resource by alternative.
Table 2.6-1 is provided as an attachment at the end of this chapter, following Table 2.2-1.
The resource-specific assessments in Chapter 4 are organized according to a logical flow of analysis.
Effects on the physical environment (for example, surface water) must be determined before effects on the associated resources (such as aquatic species) can be assessed.
This same sequence of resources is maintained in Table 2.6-1.
However, scoping concerns would dictate a different priority for considering the results, in which the following four resources are of greater importance than the others for purposes of decisionmaking: human health and safety, water quality, soils, and wildlife and aquatic species.
The analysis predicted no significant impacts to soils.
Comparison of potential impacts among the remaining three resources provides the critical information to be considered by the decisionmaker in preparing the ROD for this EIS: Human Health and Safety Â· There are no significant risks to members of the public from the proposed use of any of the control methods under any of the alternatives.
However, under Alternatives A, B, and D, an accidental spill of pesticide to a stream could make surface water unsafe for drinking or fishing.
Â· Under Alternatives A and D, there is a possibility of health effects for workers from some chemical pesticides.
No risks of worker health effects were predicted for pesticide applications under Alternative B. Under Alternatives A, B, and D, an accidental spill onto the skin could cause health risks.
Under all of the alternatives, there is a possibility of injury from cultural or prescribed fire methods.
Water Quality Â· No significant impacts to groundwater quality were predicted under any alternative.
Â· Runoff or drift from pesticide or fertilizer applications could enter streams and rivers under Alternatives A, B, and D; and fertilizers could enter surface water in runoff under Alternative C.
The effects of the estimated stream concentrations on human health and aquatic species are described under those headings.
Under Alternative B, limitations would be in place to control the potential for runoff and drift of pesticides.
Â· An accidental spill of pesticide concentrate or mix could contaminate groundwater or surface water under Alternatives A, B, and D.
A spill of fertilizer could contaminate groundwater or surface water under all alternatives.
Chapte 2 -- 30
Chapter 2 -- Description of Alternatives, Including Proposed Action Biological Resources Â· No adverse impacts to non-target vegetation are expected under any of the alternatives.
Â· There are possible risks to terrestrial wildlife species from three of the proposed insecticides under Alternatives A and D. Lethality would be expected for non-target insects in an area treated with insecticide under Alternatives A, B, and D.
No significant impacts to terrestrial wildlife were predicted under Alternatives B and C.
Â· There are no significant risks to aquatic species from use of the chemical, biological, prescribed fire, or cultural control methods under any of the alternatives.
Under maximum runoff conditions, fertilizer could cause impacts to special status species in the main tributary to Jumpoff Joe Creek at Sprague; no aquatic species risks from fertilizers were predicted at Provolt.
Under Alternatives A, B, and D, there could be adverse impacts to aquatic species from an accidental spill of pesticide to a stream.
Alternative B, the proposed action, is BLM's preferred alternative for minimizing long-term impacts to all resources, including human health.

Chapter 3 -- Affected Environment
3.0 Affected Environment 3.1 Introduction This chapter describes the relevant environment at the Provolt and Sprague Seed Orchards within the Medford District, providing baseline information to allow the evaluation of potential environmental impacts that could result from the proposed action or an alternative action.
As stated in 40 CFR 1508.14, the human environment includes natural and physical resources and the relationship of people to those resources.
The environmental baseline resources described in this chapter were selected after identifying the potential issues and concerns related to the proposed action and alternatives.
The relevant resources are described in a sufficient level of detail to adequately support the impact analysis.
Those resources which are potentially affected most significantly, such as human health and biological resources, are described in greatest detail.
Those resources which are likely to be impacted least, such as cultural resources and noise, are described in lesser detail.
The following resources would not be affected and are therefore not described in this chapter, nor evaluated in Chapter 4, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.15: Â· Visual resources: No structures would be built or demolished, nor would there be any activities that would affect visual or aesthetic resources as a result of the proposed action or an alternative.
The closest wilderness areas are the Kalmiopsis Wilderness Area, which is about 30 miles west of Provolt and 33 miles southwest of Sprague; the Red Buttes Wilderness Area, which is about 20 miles south of Provolt; the Sky Lakes Wilderness Area, which is about 50 miles northeast of Provolt and 60 miles east of Sprague; the Mountain Lakes Wilderness Area, which is about 55 miles northeast of Provolt and 70 miles east of Sprague; and the Wild Rogue Wilderness Area, which is about 25 miles west of Sprague.
The Crater Lake National Park is 65 miles northeast of Provolt and 70 miles east of Sprague.
Transportation: No construction vehicles would be involved with any action, nor would there be any changes to vehicular traffic near either Provolt or Sprague.
Â·
The chapter begins with a discussion of the resources that may be affected by the proposed action or an alternative.
The order of resource description is based on introducing the physical environment (air, geology, and water), followed by land use, human health, biological resources, and the human environment (noise, cultural resources, socioeconomics, and environmental justice).
3.2 Air Resources This section discusses the climate, meteorology, and regional air quality of the area around the Provolt and Sprague seed orchards.
3.2.1 Climate and Meteorology Provolt is approximately 15 miles southeast of the city of Grants Pass and 25 miles west of the city of Medford.
Elevations at the seed orchard range from about 1,140 feet at the northern edge to 1,200 feet at the southern edge.
Sprague is located approximately ten miles northwest of Grants Pass and about 40 miles northwest of Medford.
Elevations range from about 1,010 feet at the southeast corner to 1,100 feet at the northwest corner.
The orchards' geographical locations between the Pacific Ocean and Cascade Mountains result in a maritime west coast climate, featuring mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.
The Chapter 3 -- 1
Draft EIS -- Horning Seed Orchard IPM average July temperature at Grants Pass is 69Â° F, the average January temperature is 39Â° F, and average annual precipitation is 31 inches.
Most of the precipitation occurs between the months of November and March, consistent with the frequent Pacific storm patterns (see Table 3.2-1).
Precipitation during the spring and summer months is typically very light.
Annual average relative humidity ranges from a high of about 92%, typically in early morning, to a low of 26%, typically in the early afternoon.
Winds are predominantly from the north to northwest throughout the months of December through August and from the south from September through November.
Table 3.2-2 presents wind speed data from the Medford Airport, 25 miles to the east; average wind speeds usually range from 3 to 5 miles per hour year round.
3.2.2 Regional Air Quality The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), established by EPA and adopted by the ODEQ, define the maximum allowable concentrations of pollutants that may be reached but not exceeded within a given time period.
Primary standards protect public health, and secondary standards protect public welfare, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings.
Section 110 of the Clean Air Act requires states to develop air pollution regulations and control strategies to ensure that state air quality meets the NAAQS established by EPA.
These ambient standards, established under Section 109 of the Clean Air Act, currently address six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), lead (Pb), particulate matter (PM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).
Particulate matter is further regulated by size for particles smaller than 10 microns in diameter (PM10).
Exceeding the NAAQS concentration is referred to as "nonattainment" of the pollutant standard.
Table 3.2-3 presents the current NAAQS and the Oregon Ambient Air Quality Standards for the six criteria pollutants, along with regional air quality data for 2001, during which time all standards were met at the closest monitoring site to both Provolt and Sprague, in Grants Pass.
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 established three Federal air quality control regions (AQCRs) in western Oregon.
Provolt and Sprague seed orchards are located in the Southwest Oregon AQCR.
Air quality throughout this region currently meets Federal standards.
Areas within the Grants Pass Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and the Medford-Ashland Air Quality Maintenance Area (AQMA) have previously been in nonattainment for PM10, and areas with the Medford-Ashland UGB have been in nonattainment for CO; however, these areas have not exceeded the NAAQS for the last three years and are preparing maintenance plans.
When EPA approves these plans, these areas will be designated as maintenance areas.
The Grants Pass Central Business District has been under a maintenance plan for CO since October 2000.
Provolt is about eight miles southeast of the Grants Pass UGB, about 12 miles west of the MedfordAshland AQMA, about 15 miles west of the Medford-Ashland UGB, and about nine miles southeast of the Grants Pass Central Business District.
Sprague is about six miles northwest of

Draft EIS -- Horning Seed Orchard IPM the Grants Pass UGB, about 23 miles northwest of the Medford-Ashland AQMA, about 27 miles northwest of the Medford-Ashland UGB, and about seven miles northwest of the Grants Pass Central Business District.
The seed orchards and their immediate areas are in attainment for all criteria pollutants; that is, the national primary and secondary standards are met.
3.3 Geological Resources 3.3.1 Provolt Seed Orchard 3.3.1.1 Physiography and Topography Provolt Seed Orchard is located within the Klamath Mountains in the Western Oregon Interior Valleys Province, at the confluence of Williams Creek and the Applegate River on floodplains and an alluvial terrace.
Slopes within the seed orchard range from nearly level to 4%, generally to the north.
Elevations range from about 1,140 feet at the northern edge to 1,200 feet at the southern edge.
Williams Creek and the Applegate River have cut a relatively flat valley about one mile wide in the vicinity of Provolt.
3.3.1.2 Geology The Klamath Mountains were formed in a series of uplift and depositional events.
Thick layers of sediment have been deposited in river valleys.
This alluvium is about 250 feet thick near the Rogue and Applegate Rivers.
Three geomorphic surfaces are present at Provolt.
The Horseshoe Surface is composed of river channels, point bar deposits, and abandoned meanders on the lower floodplains.
It is underlain by deposits of sand and gravel.
The Eagle Point Surface is composed of channel deposits (sandy alluvium) on higher floodplains.
Deposits of sand and gravel also underlie this surface.
The Tou Velle Surface is situated on alluvial terraces, consisting of mediumtextured deposits.
The source material for all of these surfaces is volcanic rock from the Cascade Mountains and metamorphic (rock changed by heat and pressure) and granitic rock from the Klamath Mountains.
3.3.1.3 Soils Soil is formed by physical and chemical processes that are determined by parent material (from which the soils are derived), climate, living organisms (plants, animals, and microorganisms), topography, and time.
Hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters at Provolt result in a mixture of deciduous and conifer trees, shrubs, and grasses.
A relatively high amount of organic material returns to the soil each year from leaves and the annual dieback of vegetation.
The topographic position of these soils has resulted in well drained to excessively drained soils.
These soils have been weathered from coarse alluvial deposits, and have a low clay content.
Six types of soil are present at Provolt: Banning loam, Camas gravelly sandy loam, Central Point sandy loam, Newburg fine sandy loam, Kerby loam, and Takilma cobbly loam (SCS 1983, 1993).
The cation exchange capacity of each of these soils is in the range of 5 to 25 milliequivalents per 100 grams (meq/100 g), indicating that they contain smectite clay and low to moderate amounts of organic matter, which adsorbs pesticides and fertilizers and retards their movement through the soil.
The following paragraphs describe the soils identified on the seed orchard.
Table 3.3-1 presents soil characteristics relevant to the environmental mobility of fertilizers and pesticides.
Banning loam is a somewhat poorly drained soil on alluvial fans and drainageways in the southern part of the seed orchard.
A small portion of the planted area is composed of this soil.
It formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic, granitic, and ultramafic (a type of volcanic rock) rock.
Typically, the surface layer is a black loam about six inches thick.
From 8 to 14 inches, the soil is black clay loam.
The subsoil, from 14 to 50 inches is a very dark grayish brown clay loam.
The substratum, to a depth of 60 inches or more, is dark grayish brown clay loam.
Slopes range from Chapter 3 -- 4
Chapter 3 -- Affected Environment 0 to 3%.
The available water holding capacity is 0.13 to 0.20 inches of water per inch of soil.
The effective rooting depth is limited to 12 to 36 inches by a seasonally high water table.
Runoff is slow, and the hazard of erosion by water is slight.
The hazard of erosion by wind is very slight.
Soil pH ranges from 6.1 to 7.3.
Camas gravelly sandy loam is a deep, excessively drained soil on floodplains in the northern parts of Provolt near the Applegate River.
This area lies between the orchard units and the river.
It formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock, and altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rock (derived from lava).
Typically, the surface layer is a very dark grayish brown gravelly sandy loam about 10 inches thick.
Underlying this layer, to a depth of 60 inches, is brown to dark grayish brown very gravelly sand.
Slopes range from 0 to 3%.
Brief, occasional flooding occurs on this soil throughout the year.
The available water holding capacity is 0.07 to 0.09 inches of water per inch of soil.
The effective rooting depth of 12 to 24 inches is restricted by very gravelly sand.
Runoff is slow, and the hazard of erosion by water is moderate.
This soil is highly erodible by wind.
Soil pH ranges from 5.6 to 7.3.
Central Point sandy loam is a deep, well-drained soil on low stream terraces and alluvial fans in the northern parts of Provolt near the Applegate River.
This area is used for seed production trees and an arboretum.
It formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic and metamorphic rock.

Soil pH ranges from 6.1 to 7.3.
3.3.2 Sprague Seed Orchard 3.3.2.1 Physiography and Topography The Sprague Seed Orchard is located within the Klamath Mountains, on foot slopes and hills near Jump-off Joe Creek and its tributaries.
Slopes within the seed orchard range from nearly level to 20%, generally to the south and east.
Elevations range from about 1,010 feet at the southeast corner to 1,100 feet at the northwest corner.
Several tributaries to Jump-off Joe Creek flow through the seed orchard.
These streams have cut a gently sloping valley about Â½ mile wide in the vicinity of Sprague.
3.3.2.2 Geology As discussed in Section 3.3.1.2, the Klamath Mountains were formed in a series of uplift and depositional events.
Thick layers of sediment from erosion of the mountains have been deposited in river valleys.
Sprague is situated on slopes that are actively eroding, depositing sediment into Jump-off Joe Creek and its tributaries.
Soils at the seed orchard are overly weathered granite, generally at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.
Chapter 3 -- 6
Chapter 3 -- Affected Environment
3.3.2.3 Soils Warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters at Sprague result in a mixture of conifer and deciduous trees, shrubs, and grasses.
A relatively high amount of organic material is returned to the soil each year from leaves and the annual dieback of vegetation.
The topographic position of these soils has resulted in well-drained soils.
Two types of soils have been identified at Sprague: Holland sandy loam and Manita loam (SCS 1983).
The cation exchange capacity of each of these soils is in the range of 5 to 25 meq/100 g, indicating that they contain smectite clay and low to moderate amounts of organic matter, which adsorbs pesticides and fertilizers and retards their movement through the soil.
Additional characteristics of these soils are summarized in Table 3.3-2 and described in the following paragraphs.
Holland sandy loam is a deep, well-drained soil on hillsides in the majority of the seed orchard, and includes nearly all the managed lands.
It formed in colluvium derived mainly from granite.
Typically, the surface layer is a dark grayish brown sandy loam about eight inches thick.
The upper 20 inches of the subsoil is brown sandy loam and yellowish red sandy clay loam.
The next 21 inches is yellowish red and strong brown sandy loam.
Weathered granite is found at about 49 inches and the depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.
Slopes range from 2 to 35%.
The available water holding capacity is 0.1 to 0.16 inches of water per inch of soil.
This soil is droughty in the summer.
The potential rooting depth is 40 to 60 inches, with an effective rooting depth of about 28 inches.
Runoff is slow to rapid and the hazard of water erosion is high.
The hazard of erosion by wind is very slight.
The main limitations for tree growth are lack of adequate moisture during the growing season, the hazard of erosion, and compaction by equipment when the soil is wet.
Soil pH ranges from 5.1 to 6.5.
Seed production areas occur in this soil, particularly in the northern region of the orchard.
Nearly half of the land with Holland soil is not currently managed for conifer seed production.

Chapter 3 -- 7
Draft EIS -- Horning Seed Orchard IPM Manita loam is a deep, well-drained soil on fans and hills, which formed in colluvium derived mainly from altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rock.
At Sprague, this soil occurs mostly in the southeastern portion of the property.
Typically, the surface layer is dark reddish brown loam about 11 inches thick.
The upper nine inches of the subsurface is reddish brown clay loam and the lower 30 inches is reddish brown clay.
Depth to weathered bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches and, in some cases, exceeds 60 inches.
Slopes range from 2 to 7%.
The available water holding capacity is 0.13 to 0.21 inches of water per inch of soil.
The potential rooting depth is 40 to 60 inches, with an effective rooting depth of about 24 inches.
Runoff is slow, and the hazard of erosion by water is slight.
The hazard of erosion by wind is very slight.
The main limitations for tree growth are lack of adequate moisture during the growing season and compaction of the soil by equipment when the soil is wet.
However, the orchard does have irrigation.
Soil pH ranges from 5.4 to 6.5.
Seed production units occur on Manita soil, which is found mostly in the southeastern region of Sprague near the greenhouse and main office area.
3.4 Water Resources Water is a key resource because it is influenced by, and in turn influences, activities outside the seed orchards.
Water also provides habitat for fish and aquatic animals, plants and animals that use streamside and pondside areas.
Water entering the seed be a source of pollutants, bringing in organisms that cause tree diseases or bringing in residues from other agricultural operations.
There is also the potential for water to out of the seed orchards.
and resources as well as orchards can pesticide take pollutants
3.4.1 Provolt Seed Orchard The Provolt Seed Orchard is located in the Rogue River Basin at the confluence of the Applegate River and Williams Creek.
Williams Creek flows near the western side of the seed orchard property and crosses through the property near the northern boundary.
The orchard is located within Township 38 South, Range 4 West (Section 6) and Range 5 West (Sections 1 and 12).
3.4.1.1 Groundwater There is no site-specific information on groundwater flow for the Provolt Seed Orchard, but it is assumed to flow northwest in the same direction as the river and land surface.
The orchard does not cross any EPA- or state-designated sole source aquifers, wellhead protection areas, or groundwater management areas.
There are more than 50 domestic wells in residential areas surrounding the orchard.
The static water level in these wells ranges from 1.5 to 80 feet, and the distance to "first water" ranged between 30 and 198 feet (OWRD 2002a).
There are two production BLM wells on the Provolt Seed Orchard.
One well is approximately 200 yards northwest of the office.
It is a gallery well in a natural spring that serves as the main irrigation source for 15 orchard units.
The water collection structures are 18 feet deep, static water level is four feet, and the flow rate is 300 gallons per minute (gal/min).
Water from this well was analyzed in September 2000 for trace metals and anions (chloride, fluoride, nitrate nitrogen, and sulfate); no water quality problems were detected.
Many of the analytes were not detected (at each analytical method's limit of detection) and none exceeded their respective maximum contaminant levels.
The second well is located near the office and used for domestic purposes.
This well was renovated in 1989.
It is 85 feet deep with a static water level of 15 feet and a flow rate of 12 gal/min.
The locations of these two wells are shown in Figure 3.4-1.
There are also six shallow groundwater monitoring wells that were installed in 1992 in the southern portion of the orchard (Orchard Unit 14).
These wells were installed to monitor groundwater levels in a wet area of the orchard.

Draft EIS -- Horning Seed Orchard IPM Southwest Region staff of the Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD) recently applied for Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board grant funds to assess the groundwater resources of the Williams Creek Basin.
The assessment would assist efforts to reduce surface water diversions and eliminate fish passage barriers in the area.
Williams Creek is a tributary to the Applegate River and is a priority for streamflow restoration (OWRD 2002b).
3.4.1.2 Surface Water Provolt is in the Applegate River sub-basin of the Rogue River Basin, at the mouth of the Williams Creek watershed.
The Lower Applegate River watershed is downstream of this confluence.
There are several irrigation ditches and reservoirs on the property.
Figure 3.4-1 provides a water resources map for the seed orchard.
The following paragraphs provide hydrologic information pertaining to these water bodies.
The Applegate River flows along the northern boundary of the property.
It is a Class I stream1 with a drainage area of 483 square miles (350,330 acres).
Average discharge is about 612 cubic feet per second (cfs) at Provolt, based on extrapolated flow data from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging station 14366000, five miles upstream near the town of Applegate.
Flow has been regulated since 1980 by the Applegate Dam (gaging station 14361900 at Applegate Lake).
A maximum discharge of 37,200 cfs occurred on January 15, 1974, and the minimum discharge (since filling of Applegate Lake) of 22 cfs occurred on July 21, 2001 (USGS 2002).
Williams Creek, another Class I stream, flows near the western side of the property and crosses through the property near the northern boundary, where it flows into the Applegate River.
The Williams watershed has steep mountainous slopes and a flat valley floor.
The creek at the mouth of the river is classified as a C4 in the Rosgen classification2.
It has broad valleys, and low gradient, meandering channels, with a dominant bed material of gravel.
The drainage area is 52,944 acres, and the average discharge is estimated to be 92.5 cfs, extrapolated from flow data from the USGS's Applegate gaging station.
The property contains three irrigation ditches and two small reservoirs.
The Laurel Hill and Bridgepoint Ditch waters are both diverted from the Applegate River.
The Laurel Hill Ditch starts near the northwestern portion of the property and flows across Williams Creek via a push-up dam.
This ditch is used to irrigate three orchard units in the northwest portion of the property.
The Bridgepoint Ditch originates from the Applegate River approximately five miles upstream from the orchard, near the town of Applegate.
It flows into the orchard property at the southeast corner and flows northwest through the southern portion of the orchard until it crosses Williams Creek via a push-up dam and is diverted back into the ditch on the opposite bank.
Bridgepoint Ditch provides water for Stone Reservoir via a control gate to an underground pipe.
Stone Reservoir is located next to the orchard office and is an old farm pond that is only used for wildlife habitat.
This pond has a volume of 4.5 acre-feet and has a control gate to manage outflows as needed.
The outflow starts as a culvert and changes to a small ditch flowing east into the Applegate River.
Spencer Ditch, the third ditch, flows north through the southern part of the property where it joins the Bridgepoint Ditch.
The southern area near Spencer Ditch is flooded in most wet winters from neighboring field and woodlot runoff; a bar ditch on the southwestern side of the property collects this water.
Due to this flooding and a seasonally shallow water table, the southwestern orchard block, unit 13, is not planted now as an orchard unit but only as a cover crop.
There is another small reservoir located on the orchard property in the south-central part of the orchard that is the source of water for Spencer Ditch.
This reservoir originates from runoff and from a small tributary from the southeast.
The runoff is captured in a bar ditch along the side

A Class I stream is a body of water that provides habitat for fish.
It is designated by ODFW, as indicated on maps produced by ODFW.
The Rosgen classification system is a stream classification system based on a number of criteria associated with stream morphology.
It is used for stream habitat preservation and erosion control.
A classification of C4 indicates the following: single thread channel, slightly entrenched, moderate to high width/ depth ratio (

Chapter 3 -- Affected Environment of the county highway, joins the tributary, and flows into a culvert under the road and into the reservoir.
The reservoir holds two acre-feet and the outflow is managed by a control gate with boards leading to Spencer Ditch (see Figure 3.4-1).
Beneficial uses for the Rogue River Basin, as listed in the Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR 340-041-0362), include industrial and domestic water supplies, irrigation, and livestock watering; anadromous fish passage, salmonid fish rearing, salmonid fish spawning, resident fish, and aquatic life; wildlife and recreation (hunting, fishing, boating water contact recreation); aesthetic quality; and hydropower.
The water rights on the Applegate River, as listed by OWRD, are irrigation, fish and wildlife, agriculture and industrial use (OWRD 2002c), with irrigation representing the majority of recorded beneficial uses in the vicinity of the orchard.
The State of Oregon and Corps of Engineers water rights provide for irrigation water from the Applegate Reservoir and Applegate River through two Irrigation Ditch Company ditches.
Over-allocation of water throughout the Williams Creek watershed during summer months has contributed to low stream flows, which cause sections of lower Williams Creek to dry up entirely during July and August (Williams Creek Watershed Council 2000).
The Applegate sub-basin and Applegate River are monitored at U.S. Highway 199.
The Applegate River receives return flows from irrigated agriculture and other uses.
During high flow periods, the river exhibits high levels of fecal coliforms and biochemical oxygen demand.
During the low flow summer months, high temperature, concentrated total solids, and biochemical oxygen demand work to deplete dissolved oxygen concentrations.
It appears that non-point source pollution is contributing to a significant decrease in water quality in the Applegate River (ODEQ undated).
Williams Creek is periodically impaired by phosphate and moderately impaired by dissolved oxygen and nitrate (Williams Creek Watershed Council 2000).
Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to list impaired water bodies and determine allowable total maximum daily loads that would provide for restoration of those impaired bodies.
The list identifies those water bodies that do not meet all applicable water quality standards necessary to protect beneficial uses.
The 1998 ODEQ 303(d) list includes both the Applegate River and Williams Creek.
The section of the Applegate River that flows past Provolt was listed for its high temperatures in the low flow summer months in 1998.
Williams Creek was listed in 1998 for its high temperatures in the summer and in 2002 for dissolved oxygen (ODEQ 2002b).
Beneficial uses that are potentially affected include salmonid fish rearing and anadromous fish passage in both Williams Creek and the Applegate River, and resident fish and aquatic life and salmonid fish spawning in the Applegate River.
There are no outstanding resource waters, national- or state-designated wild and scenic rivers, or public watershed areas found on the seed orchard.
3.4.1.3 Floodplains Levels of the Applegate River are managed by the Applegate Dam, 26 miles upstream of the seed orchard, for flood control and irrigation.
The Applegate River and Williams Creek have an extensive floodplain, which includes portions of Provolt (FEMA 2002).
Orchard property is directly adjacent to Williams Creek and is also within its 100-year floodplain.
Stream bank damage occurred during the New Year 's Day 1997 flood downstream from the new State Highway 238 bridge.
BLM designed and implemented stream bank stabilization using boulders and tree rootwads in the summer of 1999.
The riverbed is now und
