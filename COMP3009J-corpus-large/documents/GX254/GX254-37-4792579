Bibliography*: Surgical treatments for morbid obesity *Selected, quality filtered, not subject to external review Issue: Clinical managers at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center in VISN 23 are reviewing the evidence on bariatric surgery for obesity to develop uniform Network-wide processes.
The VA Office of Patient Care Services requested VATAP to provide a non- annotated bibliography for their use, including any systematic reviews done in/by other countries, as per the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) HTA databas e.
As a note, this is not an issue yet for a national VHA determination.
Since Medicare covers this surgery, it would be difficult for VHA not to provide a service already available in Medicare.
Reference to the Medicare Coverage manual (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/coverage/ ) indicates a national coverage determination was made as long ago as 1979.
With the recent Medicare determination that obesity is a disease, per se, it is likely that Medicare coverage will become more expansive than restrictive.
Methods: VATAP queried INAHTA via electronic mail for relevant completed or ongoing technology assessments.
In addition, VATAP searched the HTA database (www.inahta.org) using search terms for obesity, surgery, and bariatric and HTA reports (completed) and HTA projects (ongoing).
These queries resulted in several completed and ongoing health technology assessments on treatments for obesity from INAHTA members (see Tables 1 and 2).
Of those with full text or summaries in English, reviews by NCCHTA (UK) and SBU (Sweden) represent the most recent systematic reviews that addressed a comprehensive array of surgical interventions for obesity.
The ASERNIP -S (Australia) review was narrower in scope and considered more liberal inclusion criteria.
SMM (Norway) produced a report (in Norwegian) based on previous HTA reports with an updated search of primary studies, and they provided their reference list.
VATAP supplemented these reviews with an updated search of primary studies published since 2001 comparing surgical interventions for morbid obesity.
In January 2003, VATAP searched the Cochrane Library (2002, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents, using search terms for controlled studies of bariatric surgery or surgical treatment of morbid obesity.
In all, the search identified 108 citations.
From the search and the list from SMM (Norway), VATAP selected primary randomized and/or controlled clinical trials published in English and high quality reviews with explicit methods that were relevant to the topic.
It should be noted that VATAP retrieved a Cochrane review protocol (Colquitt J, Clegg A, Sidhu M, Royle P. Surgery for morbid obesity.
In: The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002.
Oxford: Update Software), which corresponds to the NCCHTA (UK) review (2002).
Results: ?? A bibliography of: 1) the three most recent systematic reviews from INAHTA members published in 2002 with full text or summaries in English, and 2) primary studies of randomized and/or controlled clinical trials, and other high quality reviews retrieved in the search, published since 2001.
?? All responses from INAHTA agencies on completed or ongoing assessments of treatments for morbid obesity (Tables 1 and 2).

Results In patients with BMI
NICE has recommended that surgery to aid weight loss should be available as a treatment option for people with morbid obesity provided that they meet all of the following criteria: ?? They are aged 18 years or over ?? They have been receiving treatment in a specialist obesity clinic at a hospital ?? They have tried all other appropriate non-surgical treatments to lose weight but have not been able to maintain weight loss ?? There are no specific medical or psychological reasons contraindicating s urgery ?? They are generally fit enough to have an anesthetic and surgery ?? They should understand that they will need to be followed- up by a doctor and other healthcare professionals such as dieticians or psychologists over the long- term.
People with morbid obesity should have surgery to aid weight loss only after they have had a full assessment by the specialist and other healthcare professionals involved in their care.
In addition, counselling and support should be arranged for people before and after the s urgery.

Qualitative synthesis of 6 studies published in various databases through Summer 2001 comparing LAGB to vertical banded gastroplasty and/or gastric bypass
?? There is "strong evidence" (=more than one RCT) that Gastric Bypass is more effective on weight reduction than other surgical procedures ?? Surgery is superior to any other treatment for morbid obesity (BMI
?? There is evidence that weight reduction 10 years after operation is more than 20 kg (about 16%) ?? There is evidence that quality of life improves significantly among these patients (we have a separate chapter on all studies of quality of life in this field).
?? There is also a chapter on prevention and one on alternative/complementary medicine including a number of Ch inese studies.
All together they identified 500 studies of alternative medicine and obesity treatment.
There is no scientific evidence that any of the alternative treatments have any effect.
The level of evidence for follow up data up to 4 years is from quasi-randomized controlled trials or from non-randomized comparative studies without significant flaws.
For people with BMI
Up to 2 years gastric bypass results in more weight loss than LAGB; from 2- 4 years there is insufficient evidence to conclude that gastric bypass is more effective than LAGB ?? Investigators recommend further evaluation by RCT to define the long term efficacy of LABG relative to comparator procedures.
In Norwegian http://www.oslo.sintef.no/smm/ Supplied VATAP with reference list ?? Based on fair to poor levels of evidence with unclear inclusion criteria, the comparative safety and efficacy of LAGB for treatment of morbid obesity cannot be firmly established.
?? The role of LAGB should be determined by well designed studies with

Ongoing INAHTA Assessments of Treatments for Morbid Obesity
Source: HTA database at www.inahta.org and INAHTA listserv Organization CCOHTA (Canada) MSAC (Australia) CMS (US) Topic CCOHTA is planning to do a "pre- assessment" (a summary of the available HTA evidence from other agencies) as they get regular requests for information on this procedure.
MSAC is currently reviewing gastric banding for morbid obesity.
The review is expected to be finalised at the Committee's March or May 2003 meeting, with the Federal Minister for Health and Ageing then to make a decision on the Committee's funding recommendation.
CMS Coverage and Analysis Group is starting to look at treatments for obesity.
The project is not driven by a request for a national coverage determination so the timeline is more elastic than usual.
The review will include surgical procedures.
They are commissioning a TA through AHRQ for parts of the review while we plan to do other portions in-house.
They are beginning a TA on non-drug treatments for obesity, which will probably take about 6 months.
Last year they did a quick review on Bariatric Surgery and the results are available (in Spanish).
PDF on file with VATAP.
During 2002 they developed a new project on this topic, with systematic review and a survey of practice in Spain.
The report will be available by March.
