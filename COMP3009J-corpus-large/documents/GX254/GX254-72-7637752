PROGRAM MISSION - TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (Cont'd) Program Emphasis The program emphasis is on the development and commercialization of technologies which have the potential to radically alter current trends of United States and world demand for energy, particularly oil.
Seventy-six percent of total transportation sector energy consumption is used by on-highway vehicles--cars and trucks.
Working in partnership with industry and others, the mission of the Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT) program is to provide consumers with vehicle choices which result in significant oil demand and greenhouse gas emission reductions.
Specific strategic objectives are to: (1) improve the fuel economy of transportation vehicles; and (2) increase the production and use of cost-effective alternative transportation fuels.
Industry often organizes for design, production, and marketing of cars and trucks around the idea of vehicle "platforms."
"Class" is another term used to describe vehicles having distinctively different characteristics and capabilities.
In DOE's transportation sector program, every activity contributes to fuel economy improvement and/or alternative fuel capability for one or more of the following vehicle "platforms."
1.
Automobiles.
2.
Light Trucks, including mini-vans and sport utility vehicles.
(Classes 1 and 2) 3.
Medium Trucks, such as delivery vans.
(Classes 3 through 6) 4.
Heavy Trucks, such as inter-city "18-wheelers."
(Classes 7 and 8) The diagram below illustrates how activities funded in the automotive and heavy vehicle portions of the budget are related to these basic vehicle platforms.
In every portion of the budget which supports technology research and development, each activity is directed primarily at a particular vehicle platform.
However, as the diagram indicates, each R
For example, fuel cell development activities are focused specifically on achieving characteristics required for successful use in automobiles; but advances made could well result in truck and bus applications.
The solid lines identify primary targets; dotted lines identify vehicle types which could also be changed based on results from each respective program.

TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (dollar in thousands) ADVANCED AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGIES I. I. A. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: Statement of Mission
The Advanced Automotive Technologies program is the technological cornerstone for the nation's initiative to significantly improve the energy efficiency of, and reduce emissions from, our light duty vehicles, with a direct emphasis on automobile applications.
An updated R
This R
Plan development has included participation of stakeholders such as the auto industry and its supplier companies, energy companies, State and other Federal agencies, and other DOE organizations.
This Advanced Automotive Technologies program provides the primary support for research and development required to achieve the 80 miles per gallon (mpg) fuel economy goal of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV).
This work is important because automobiles are 97 percent dependent upon petroleum-based fuels and consume about 33 percent of the total petroleum used in the United States, of which 50 percent is imported.
Furthermore, the automobile is a major contributor to emissions of global climate change gases and criteria air pollutants, including volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter.
The current status of technology allows many opportunities, but also tremendous challenges, for improvement.
For example: current baseline engine efficiencies are about 23 percent--program targets would more than double this efficiency; current energy storage technologies limit advanced vehicle driving ranges--the program seeks to develop electric vehicle batteries and other technologies that would enable ranges equal to those of conventional vehicles.
Through this program, the Department engages the technical and financial resources of the government and its laboratories, the automobile and fuels industries, their suppliers, and universities in a customer-focused national program to research and develop advanced automobile technologies, and to support their integration into affordable vehicles.
Through partnering with industry, critical components and vehicle system technologies are identified and developed that will enable successful commercialization of electric and hybrid vehicles in the mid term, and fuel cell-powered vehicles in the longer term.
With program success, pre-production prototype vehicles that provide up to 100 percent greater fuel economy will be available by the year 2001; in the longer term (2005-2010), automobiles that have three times the fuel economy of today's conventional automobiles will be developed.
Successful development

of these technologies will also result in vehicles with near-zero emissions and enhanced fuel flexibility, and which are otherwise competitive in all respects with conventional products in the global marketplace.
The key elements of the program include: Automotive Alternative Fuels R
In many cases, programs are closely coordinated with related efforts of other organizations.
For example, compression ignition direct injection technology development for the PNGV is tightly coordinated with activities funded by the Advanced Heavy Vehicle Technologies program; several projects that address technologies applicable to both automobiles and trucks are jointly funded by the two Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT) organizations.

Research and development activities funded by the alternative fuels program will help the private sector complete the development of commercially attractive ethanol fueled passenger cars.
In addition, work on lower cost, higher capacity natural gas on-board storage systems will help promote the use of that alternative fuel.

2000.
Introduction of long-term advanced batteries, which could power electric vehicles with a range comparable to conventional vehicles by the year 2001, will result in oil savings of 5,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2002, growing to 150,000 bpd in 2010 as market penetration increases to 2.7 percent.
As a result of Vehicle Systems R
Continued market penetration will result in oil savings of 369,000 bpd in 2020.
As a result of R
This will result in small savings in 2010.
However, by 2020 it is estimated that the benefits of the program will be 103,000 barrels per day of oil reduction, $2.0 billion in energy cost savings, and 4.1 million metric tons of carbon-equivalent emissions reduction.
The primary benefits of Advanced Combustion Engine R
Additional benefits will result from the application of CIDI engine technology in conventional vehicles, which are estimated to reach 62,000 barrels per day of oil reduction annually, and over $1.3 billion of energy cost savings, by 2010.
I. C. Performance Goals
Strategy/Goal: By 2010, in collaboration with U.S. auto industry partners, produce technologies that lead to vehicles in production which are up to three times more fuel efficient than today's vehicles, and which will reduce nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions by two-thirds compared to today's new car average without compromising safety, comfort, and cost.
Also, these technologies will make the battery-powered electric vehicle an attractive and preferred option for many vehicle users.
Interim Goal: By the year 2000, complete development of production feasible hybrid propulsion systems that can double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles, compared to 1995 models, by all three of the United States' major auto manufacturers.
Continuing work on propulsion systems and energy storage will be combined with advanced lighter weight vehicle structures to meet the PNGV goal of 80 miles per gallon, for a production prototype, in 2004.
The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) will have demonstrated long-term battery technology in electric vehicles that are competitive with conventional vehicles in all respects.

TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (dollars in thousands) ADVANCED HEAVY VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES I. I. A. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: Statement of Mission
Since the 1973 Arab oil embargo, data from the Energy Information Agency indicates that essentially all of the increase in highway fuel consumption has been due to trucks.
In 1996, trucks consumed as much fuel as automobiles due to the continued growth of freight transport provided by heavy trucks and the explosive growth in the popularity of relatively low miles per gallon (mpg) light trucks such as pickups, vans, and sport utility vehicles used for personal transport.
The gross domestic product, and hence economic activity, depends on the movement of goods.
Truck energy use is less discretionary; trucks are the mainstay for trade/commerce and economic growth and, thus, critical to the economy.
The goal of Advanced Heavy Vehicle Technologies R
These technologies will enable pickup trucks to achieve at least a 35 percent efficiency improvement relative to current gasoline-fueled trucks.
The strategy is to focus R
This strategy supports the DOE strategic goals of enhanced energy productivity (Goal 1), reduced vulnerability (Goal 2), reduced environmental impacts (Goal 3), and economic/regional equity (Goal 4), through the development of energy efficient/alternative fuel capable clean diesel engine technologies.
The diesel has the highest efficiency of the commercial engines used in highway vehicles today (44 percent efficient vs. 24 percent for production gasoline engines), and can be made even more efficient (at least 55 percent) with advanced technologies.
The diesel engine is the engine of choice for heavy duty trucks used for commercial transport because it offers power, efficiency, reliability, and durability.
It runs on alternative fuels, e.g., natural gas, dimethyl ether, ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, and can be made fuel flexible, i.e., use more than one kind of liquid fuel in the same engine.
With successful research and development, diesel engine exhaust can be cleaned up to ultra low emissions through a combination of in-cylinder combustion control, exhaust aftertreatment, and fuel formulation.
Because diesel engine manufacturers have the production and nationwide field service infrastructure in place, this technology constitutes an attractive potential technology for efficiency improvements by replacing gasoline engines with "clean diesels" in the fastest growing market segment of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
I.
Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: ADVANCED HEAVY VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES (Cont'd)
Continual improvement of diesel engine efficiency and fuel flexibility is a real, achievable strategy for maintaining the energy and economic security of the trucking industry.
Further reducing truck energy use is perhaps most readily achievable through devolution of energy efficient, fuel-flexible, ultra low emissions heavy duty diesel engine technologies through all truck classes.
For instance, annual sales of Class 1-2 trucks, essentially all of which use less efficient gasoline-fueled engines, have increased dramatically in the past 12 years, from approximately 3 million vehicles in 1983 to over 6 million vehicles in 1995 (from 25 to 42 percent of the foreign and domestic highway vehicle sales in the U.S.).
The vehicle production industry is shifting substantial manufacturing emphasis to light trucks in response to the growth in demand for pickups, sport utility vehicles, and vans.
The diesel engine can provide power (especially needed for four-wheel drive, hauling, and towing--popular features of pickups and sport utility vehicles) and ruggedness, in addition to higher energy efficiency.
Emissions control technologies to meet increasingly more stringent environmental standards are the key enablers for greater utilization of the inherently higher efficiency diesel engine.
This is the critical requirement for market entry if potential energy savings are to be realized.
Advanced Heavy Vehicle Technologies program activities will continue to focus on the diesel engine in both heavy vehicle systems R
A second part of the systems program will continue the evaluation of the reduction of parasitic energy losses from aerodynamics, rolling resistance, and accessories in conventional on-highway large trucks.
The high efficiency light truck engine R
Critical enabling technology will be developed cooperatively between the U.S. diesel engine manufacturers and the U.S. automakers.
These engine concepts integrate major design advances such as higher peak cylinder and fuel injection pressures, increased sophistication in microprocessor control, improved turbocharger efficiency, and the introduction of turbo compounding, in addition to a substantial effort in cost and size reduction.
Diesel engine performance will be optimized, while reducing emissions to or below EPA standards, by simultaneously addressing incylinder combustion control, exhaust aftertreatment technologies, and fuel formulation strategies.
Modeling and validation of engine combustion will continue to enable more definitive understanding of the chemical species formed in the combustion process.
Electric and hybrid electric technologies developed with DARPA funding through the Advanced Transportation Technology Consortia (ATTC) have matured to a level that requires a focus on specific applications to complete the development cycle.
Many urban service vehicles, such as delivery trucks and buses, can utilize electric propulsion to achieve much higher fuel efficiency and substantially reduced emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.
These vehicles are typically operated and managed as part of fleets, both government and private.
Fleet applications with the highest potential for energy and carbon savings, as well as economic success, will be used to guide the next phase of development under DOE and DOT.
Test vehicles are expected to be completed and placed in the fleets for evaluation as early as 2000.
The diversity and typical low manufacturing volume of service type vehicles will require
I.
Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: ADVANCED HEAVY VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES (Cont'd)
that several different applications be identified to achieve a large impact.
This is compatible with the structure of the ATTC, allowing each region to independently bring value to the program.
Heavy Vehicle Alternative Fuels R
A complementary combustion research activity focuses on alternative fuels appropriate for heavy vehicle use.
Research tools developed for diesel fuel combustion R
Fuel formulation strategies focus on obtaining minimum emissions.
Responding to customer input, the Heavy Vehicle Technologies program embarked in FY 1997 on a major effort to increase the efficiency of natural gas engines from their current 37 percent level to be more nearly coincident with the current 44 percent efficiency of heavy duty diesel engines.
These efforts will be maintained in FY 1999 and will contribute significantly to the economical transition to and operation of heavy duty Class 7-8 trucks on liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Also in FY 1999 another research emphasis will be maintained to enhance the on-board storage of natural gas to enable the transition to and operation of Class 3-6 (local delivery) trucks on compressed natural gas (CNG).
Trucks operating on such a clean fuel as natural gas in downtown non-attainment areas will make a substantial contribution to reducing the vehicular pollution burden in these areas.
For FY 1999, program integration and collaborative research leveraging efforts begun in FY 1997 with the DOE Office of Energy Research (ER) and the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) will be expanded and solidified.
The Heavy Vehicle Technologies program was awarded support by ER for two collaborative pilot projects focused on diesel engine emissions control research.
Dubbed "DOE 2000," the ER initiative is funding the development and emplacement of the high speed information network to enable geographically distributed researchers to collaborate in the areas of diesel combustion and catalytic aftertreatment of diesel exhaust.
The Heavy Vehicle Technologies program is supporting both scientific combustion studies and extensive diesel engine testing of compression ignitable clean diesel fuels coming from the research efforts of FE's Advanced Fuels Conversion and Liquefaction Programs.
The Heavy Vehicle Technologies Program is supporting research at the High Temperature Materials Laboratory (HTML) to characterize catalysts needed by these programs to advance these fuels processing technologies to commercial reality.
Characterization of carbon produced materials from coal will also be maintained in support of FE.
The Heavy Vehicle Systems R
The track record of the high efficiency engine program for improving the state of the art is reflected in the improved efficiency of current production engines--a success story brought about through industry/government cooperation.
The advancements in alternative fuel enabling technologies developed under the Heavy Vehicle Alternative Fuels R
The combination of the two programs will encourage the U.S. diesel industry to offer efficient natural gas and flexible fuel technologies in mainstream production engines.

By 2004, as part of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) initiative, advanced automotive materials technology should be available which will ensure that the weight of light duty vehicles can be reduced by 40 percent compared to the 1994 PNGV baseline and that the powertrain can achieve energy conversion efficiencies sufficient to meet the 80 miles per gallon target.
The Heavy Vehicle Materials Technology program focuses on two areas: (a) heavy vehicle propulsion, and (b) high strength weight reduction materials.
In collaboration with U.S. industry and universities, heavy vehicle propulsion system materials efforts focus on the materials technologies critical to the development of diesel engines for light trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles, as well as the low emissions, 55 percent efficient (LE-55) heavy duty diesel engine for heavy trucks.
These include thick thermal barrier coatings and insulating structural ceramics, advanced fuel system materials, materials for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate reduction, advanced air handling materials, and smart materials (i.e., materials that can change their properties as a function of how they are used) for fuel injection systems.
The design of advanced components for high efficiency diesel engines has, in some cases, pushed the performance envelope for materials of construction past the point of reliable operation.
Higher mechanical and surface stresses and higher temperatures of advanced designs limit the engine designer; advanced materials allow the design of components that may operate reliably at higher stresses and temperatures, thus enabling more efficient engine designs.
Advanced materials also offer the

opportunity to improve the emissions; noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH); and performance of diesel engines for pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles.
In the area of high strength weight reduction materials, energy savings from commercial trucking is possible with high strength materials which can reduce the vehicle weight within the existing envelope, so as to increase payload capacity, and thereby reduce the number of trucks needed on the highways.
Increased safety can be obtained from new brake materials and by incorporating high shock absorbent materials in truck structures for improved control and crashworthiness.
The High Temperature Materials Laboratory (HTML), at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is a modern research facility that houses in its six user centers a unique collection of instruments for characterizing materials.
It supports a wide variety of high temperature ceramics and metals R
The HTML enables scientists and engineers to solve materials problems that limit the efficiency and reliability of advanced energy conversion systems by providing access to sophisticated state-of-the-art equipment which few individual companies and institutions can afford to purchase and maintain.

TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (dollars in thousands) TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT I. I. A. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: Statement of Mission
This program's mission is to reduce oil consumption, as well as environmental emissions, through promoting the introduction and commercialization of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and advanced technology vehicles with significantly improved fuel economy.
During and following successful technology development by industry and government, and in coordination with partners, stakeholders, and customers, this program provides the catalyst needed to establish an improved public understanding about, and resulting market demand for, alternative fuel vehicles, advanced technology vehicles, and advanced fuels; and establish a strong and far-reaching fuel and service infrastructure.
The program is designed to provide support at critical periods in the transition of advanced transportation technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace, and then reduce government support as market penetration improves for vehicles which reduce petroleum consumption.
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) establishes multiple goals for alternative fuel technology development and utilization.
Fuels of interest include biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, hydrogen, methanol, natural gas, and propane.
Relative to petroleum fuel substitution, the basic EPACT goal is to promote the development and use of domestic replacement fuels to substitute for imported petroleum motor fuels to the maximum extent practicable.
Within the context of the basic program goal, DOE focuses its program on those replacement fuels which will have the greatest impact on: reducing oil imports, improving the nation's economy, and reducing criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.
Achieving these goals will require the establishment of sustainable alternative fuel and vehicle production industries, and extensive private sector investment in supporting infrastructure.
Markets for the products of these industries will be based on the confidence of consumers in the performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and other characteristics of those products.
This program is about building that confidence by weaving together a variety of activities in response to customer needs.
The program will: T Forge partnerships with fleet owners, fuel providers, vehicle manufacturers, and State and local governments to expand the use of alternative fuel vehicles and the development of refueling infrastructure.
T Provide current, accurate, reliable information on all types of alternative fuels and vehicles.
T Perform rigorous, structured programs to test and evaluate cars and trucks that use alternative fuels.
I.
Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT (Cont'd) T Implement the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.
T Promote consumer acceptance of advanced technology cars and trucks with significantly improved fuel economy.
With fleets paving the way for higher volume, lower cost vehicle production, and the installation of refueling capability, the objective is to make alternative fuel vehicles the choice of many individual private vehicle purchasers by the year 2000.
Local, voluntary initiatives and agreements can be the mechanism by which all parties with a stake in alternative fuels can develop their plans together.
With this premise, DOE has created and nurtured the Clean Cities program.
Clean Cities is a voluntary Federal program designed to accelerate and expand the use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in communities throughout the country, and to provide refueling and maintenance facilities for their operation.
As of January 1998, sixty communities have joined the Clean Cities program.
Clean Cities encourages local governments and organizations to form public/private partnerships in developing markets for AFVs.
Many of these local programs have links across regional and State boundaries to establish Clean Corridors with refueling infrastructure to allow inter-city travel with alternative fuel vehicles.
Under provisions of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 and EPACT, a large number of vehicles are included in the Department of Energy's data acquisition activities.
These vehicles represent a comprehensive cross section of our national commercial fleet.
Projects are cost shared with many industry, State, and Federal groups.
These activities place state-of-the-art AFV technology "on the road" for realworld fleet test evaluation.
Over 1,000 Federal and commercial sedans, pickup trucks, vans, minivans, snowplows, garbage trucks, long-haul trucks, school buses, and urban mass transit buses have been tracked continuously, with performance, fuel economy, emissions, and maintenance data provided to the DOE-sponsored Alternative Fuels Data Center for compilation, analysis and dissemination.

TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES TRANSPORTATION SECTOR (dollars in thousands) IMPLEMENTATION AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT I. I. A. Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives: Statement of Mission
Implementation and Program Management supports the human resource requirements as well as the Office-level analysis, assessment, evaluation, and planning functions for the Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT).
The mission of the program is to provide the integrated program direction needed to plan, manage, and oversee the research, development, and technology deployment activities funded by the transportation sector program.
The analytical and evaluation part of the mission is accomplished by collecting and analyzing technology and market data, using computer models to project technology potential and market share, and calculating program benefits.
The technology assessment activity estimates the impacts, benefits, and costs of advanced transportation vehicle and fuel technologies.
A system of models has been created that: (1) estimates the market shares of new light duty vehicle sales for alternative advanced vehicle technologies; and (2) calculates the alternative fuel use, petroleum use reductions, and changes in ambient and global emissions.
These models are continually being improved and updated to consider new technology developments, and to be consistent with projections prepared by the Energy Information Administration.
The models are also being used to estimate the impacts of individual technology programs during budget formulation and program planning.
The analysis function produces the annual Transportation Energy Data Book; assembles the best past and current data to use in updating transportation sector plans; and supports preparation and updating of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Department of Energy plans.
