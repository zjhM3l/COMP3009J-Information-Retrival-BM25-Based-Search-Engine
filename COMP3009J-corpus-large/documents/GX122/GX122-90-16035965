Wildlife Cameras Javelina Pecari tajacu [javelina1w.jpg] Javelinas, or collared peccaries, have a limited distribution in the U.S., but are common at Saguaro National Park.
They usually travel in herds and are active both day and night.
Though similar in appearance, they are not pigs and differ from pigs in behavior and physiology.
