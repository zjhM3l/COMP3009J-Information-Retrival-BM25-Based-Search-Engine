Take notice that the State Board of Pharmacy (the Board) is considering proposing amendments to the existing Board rules concerning the duties and responsibilities of pharmacy technicians.
Currently, the Board rules refer to those persons who perform pharmaceutical functions under the direct supervision of a pharmacist as "supportive personnel."
Over time, however, the term "supportive personnel" has taken on a more expansive meaning among members of the regulated community, and currently is often used to describe not only those persons who perform pharmaceutical functions, but also cashiers and/or clerks employed by the pharmacy to perform non-pharmaceutical related tasks.
The Board is considering replacing all references to the term "supportive personnel" with the term "pharmacy technician," as "pharmacy technician" is the phrase currently used to describe individuals who perform pharmaceutical related tasks throughout the regulated community in New Jersey and in a majority of other states.
In addition to the proposed change in terminology, the Board is also considering proposing amendments to clarify and expand the list of duties that may appropriately be performed by pharmacy technicians.
Currently, supportive personnel are permitted by rule to assist the pharmacist in clerical matters.
Supportive personnel may also count, weigh, measure or pour prescription medications under the pharmacist's direct supervision.
The Board believes that a more detailed list of activities that pharmacy technicians may perform, in addition to a clear delineation of impermissible activities, should be provided in order to give licensees more guidance as to how such individuals may be utilized in the practice of pharmacy.
The Board is also considering proposing amendments to the pharmacist to technician ratio rule, which currently provides that a pharmacist may not supervise more than two pharmacy technicians at any one time.
Currently, this ratio of one pharmacist to two technicians may not be exceeded under any circumstances.
The Board believes, however, that if a pharmacy employs pharmacy technicians who have passed the National Pharmacy Technician Certification Examination, or if a pharmacy conducts its own pharmacy technician training program which satisfies the requirements of the rule, and if the pharmacy meets certain other requirements, such as the maintenance of a policies and procedures manual which delineates the specific duties of the technician, the pharmacy should be permitted to employ a greater number of technicians to work under the supervision of a single pharmacist.
The Board believes that the requirements outlined in the contemplated amendment will help ensure that if a pharmacy chooses to employ more technicians than currently allowed by the one to two ratio, that those technicians will be appropriately trained and have sufficient instruction in the tasks and functions they are permitted to perform.
The Board is also contemplating proposing a new rule that would allow pharmacists to take meal breaks while working in a pharmacy or pharmacy department, provided certain conditions are satisfied, in order to address concerns raised by many members of the regulated community concerning this issue.
The Board will also propose various technical amendments to the rules in subchapter 39, in order to clarify the requirements of the existing rules.
The Board invites all interested parties to submit comments and suggestions concerning this pre-proposal.
Such public comments and suggestions will be considered by the Board in formulating a formal proposal which will again be subject to public comment prior to final adoption.
