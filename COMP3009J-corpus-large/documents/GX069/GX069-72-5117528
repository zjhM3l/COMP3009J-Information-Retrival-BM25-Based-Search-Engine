Middle Santa Cruz Subarea
I. SUBAREA: The subarea defines the watersheds formed by the Santa Catalina Mountains on the north, the Rincon mountains on the east, and the Tucson Mountains to the west.
The southern boundary follows a line running south of Interstate 10 and north of the San Xavier District.
This area drains the Santa Cruz River and its tributary, the Rillito River, which in turn is fed by the Tanque Verde Creek, Agua Caliente Wash and Pantano Wash as indicated on the map entitled, "Modern Communities, Transportation, and Ownership."
The subarea encompasses approximately 565 square miles and contains southern Arizona's primary urban settlement, the City of Tucson and its outlying metropolitan areas.
The Middle Santa Cruz subarea contains approximately 361, 852 acres, within which land status is broken down as presented in the table below.
Unlike most of eastern Pima County where state trust land makes up the majority of the land base, in this subarea, private lands rank first.
Federal lands in Catalina, Rincon and the Tucson Mountains come second, state trust lands are third, followed by the military reservation at the Davis-Monthan Air Base, Pima County Park lands in Tucson Mountain Park, and lastly Tribal lands belonging to the Tohono O'odham San Xavier District as indicated in the table below.

The year 2000 population estimate for the Middle Santa Cruz subarea is 697,947 making it the most densely populated subarea in Pima County and second only to Phoenix in the state of Arizona.
The subarea includes the City of Tucson and the community of Summerhaven at the top of the Catalina Mountains.
Tucson is a heavily urbanized area that is rapidly growing and future growth projections put the combined population of Tucson and adjoining Pima County at over one million by the year 2010.
Historically, the subarea included farming and ranching, but those activities have been completely replaced by commercial, residential, and transportation related development.
II.
CULTURAL RESOURCES: This section presents information and analysis of current data on archaeological sites, historic resources and traditional cultural places within the subarea.
A. Archaeological sites "Archaeological sites are any material remains of past human life or activities which are preserved in their original setting that are important to understanding prehistory or history.
These sites or districts may include occupation sites, work areas, farming sites, burials and other funerary remains, artifacts, campsites, hearths, rock art, intaglios, trails, battle sites, religious or ceremonial sites, caves and rock shelters, the architectural or other remains of structures of all kinds, such as pit houses, pueblo rooms, adobe or rock foundations, and other domestic features, usually dating from prehistoric or aboriginal periods, or from historic periods at least 50 years old, for which only archaeological vestiges remain" (Preserving Cultural and Historic Resources, Pima County, May 1999).
Archaeologists learn about the past by collecting and analyzing information in two ways: through survey and by excavation.
Survey involves inspecting the ground surface in a particular area and recording concentrations of artifacts and features (hearths, roasting pits, pit houses, etc.) as archaeological sites.
A site represents the physical remains of past human behavior in a single location dating to one or more periods of use through time.
Surveys are often done systematically by groups of archaeologist who walk the land in regularly spaced lines looking for artifacts.
Some surveys, however, are judgmental in that archaeologists only look where sites are expected to be found and not elsewhere.
In all cases, survey offers an extensive perspective on past land use.
The second kind of information on archaeological sites is gained through excavation.
This is the systematic recording, recovery, and analysis of artifacts and features from within a site's limits.
Critical information is gained by understanding the spatial relationship of all artifacts and features within a three dimensional context.
This enables interpretation about how the site was used, by whom, when, whether the site was used more than once and what happened after it was abandoned.
Often, archaeological sites are not fully excavated but are only partially sampled.
This saves what is left of the site for future investigations.
Archaeological excavation provides highly detained information about the use of one limited spatial area during one or more use episodes.
Archaeologist use survey information in conjunction with site excavation information to build regional time lines over broad areas such as a river valley.
Previous Research A complete summary of the archaeological history of the subarea is not possible in this space; however, some highlights of that history are presented below.
As is the case elsewhere within Pima County, archaeological research began in the early part of the 20th century when archaeology as an intellectual discipline was in its infancy.
In 1910, Ellsworth Huntington recorded two Hohokam village sites in the foothills of the Catalina Mountains.
The Gibbons Spring Site and nearby Sabino Canyon ruin demonstrated the presence of prehistoric settlements in the upper bajadas in close proximity to natural springs and both sites were subject to excavation in later years.
Byron Cummings, head of the anthropology department at the University of Arizona sent his students into the Rincon Valley, one of whom, Emil Haury excavated at Tanque Verde Ruin in 1927.
In 1936, Isabel Kelly excavated the Hodges ruin, one of the largest Hohokam sites in the Tucson Basin.
Located at the confluence of the Satna Cruz and Rillito Rivers, this site was occupied repeatedly over time and Kelly's well controlled excavation stood as one of the only sources of information on the Pre-Classic period in the Hohokam archaeological sequence for many years.
In 1940, Julian Hayden excavated at the University Indian Ruin, a large Hohokam village located near the confluence of the Tanque Verde Creek and the Pantano Wash.
The work at this site was directed at the Classic Period (A.D. 1150 - A.D. 1450) that followed the main occupation of the Hodges Ruin.
Hayden's research contributed to the development of a regional chronology and an aerial synthesis, which were the primary objectives of archaeological research up until the middle 1960s.
During these years, the discipline of archaeology underwent a theoretical transformation and new environmental laws were passed that mandated archaeological investigations in advance of federally funded construction.
These changes shifted the focus of research from chronology to questions relating to cultural evolution and greatly expanded the pace and extent of archaeological study throughout the region.
One of the first studies to reflect this new orientation was the excavation project conducted at Punta del Agua near San Xavier in 1965-1966.
This research effort attempted to recover information on changes in social organization of the Hohokam Indians over time.
Shortly thereafter major changes in downtown Tucson were initiated through the Tucson Urban Renewal Project.
This large scale federally funded improvement project started in 1967 and ultimately resulted in the construction of the new civic plaza and related facilities in the heart of the historic core of Tucson.
Over the years, whole city blocks associated with the early history of Tucson were razed; however, this also provided an opportunity to look at historic archaeological deposits in Tucson.
While limited testing of historic deposits was conducted in the vicinity of the remains of the Convento and the Presidio in the 1940s and 1950s, archaeological research aimed specifically at historic sites was rare.
The TUR project expanded the scope of study documenting the continuum of occupation in Tucson from prehistoric time to the modern era.
Recently, additional historic archaeological research in the historic core area has been sponsored by the City of Tucson as part of its Tucson Origins project.
Most of the survey and excavation projects that have been conducted in the Tucson area have occurred since the 1970s and 1980s.
One of the larger surveys in the subarea was conducted by the Arizona State Museum as part of the Santa Cruz River Park study in 1975-1976.
This survey covered both sides of the Santa Cruz river from its confluence with the Rillito to north of the San Xavier District boundary and recorded valuable archaeological information on sites in heavily developed areas.
A National Register nomination form was filled out for the 13 mile long project area that includes 33 major archaeological sites, most of which are large Hohokam villages, such as the Valencia Site and the West Branch Site.
Excavation at the West Branch site in 1984 refined regional dates for the Pre-Classic time period and documented the organization of household subsistence practices in prehistory.
The other large archaeological survey in the subarea focused on the National Park lands within the Saguaro National Monument West Unit in the Rincon Mountains.
Survey work started in the mid 1960s and continued up until the 1990s resulting in the recording of hundreds of archaeological sites in the mountain foothills.
Tumamoc Hill and the adjacent bajadas were also surveyed in the 1970s by the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society.
This large volcanic prominence on the west side of the Santa Cruz River is the location of a prehistoric trincerhas site that is characterized by numerous rock walls or terraces along with hundreds of other kinds of rock features used for dry farming in prehistory.
Evidence suggests that the hill and the surrounding area was utilized for thousands of years.
Survey on the Flying V Ranch at Ventana Canyon in the mid 1980s, discovered further evidence of Archaic and Hohokam populations settling in the foothills of the Catalina Mountains.
While the Hohokam use of the subarea was well established years ago, the antiquity of human settlement in the Tucson area became clearer after the excavation of the Milagro site located on one of the older terraces along the Tanque Verde Wash.
This site, excavated in 1984, represents one of the oldest known agricultural settlements in the southwest.
The significance of the sites relates to its containing evidence for sedentary agricultural existence dating to 800 B.C. placing the origins of agriculture in the region centuries earlier than previously thought.
This corroborated other hints from the Cienega Creek area suggesting that the Hohokam Indians did not bring agriculture to the Tucson Basin, but rather, earlier Archaic populations were practicing this form of subsistence long before the Hohokam culture emerged.
Excavations conducted in the mid to late 1990s along the I-10 corridor have further supported this view by revealing a series of ancient villages located adjacent to the Santa Cruz flood plain from approximately Speedway Boulevard to Ruthrauf Road in Tucson.
Archaeological testing during the planning stages of frontage road construction along I-10 has detected most of these sites.
Last year, another site was found further to the north during testing in advance of construction at Pima County's wastewater treatment facility at Ina Road.
The results of testing and follow up excavation at the Santa Cruz Bend site, Square Hearth, Stone Pipe, Canal, Los Pozos and Las Capas sites have documented use of the Santa Cruz flood plain from the end of the Middle Archaic Period to the early centuries after Christ, a time span of approximately 4000 years.
These sites contain evidence of corn agriculture, canal irrigation, and sedentary village life, traits previously thought to have entered the Tucson area much later in prehistory.
With this new knowledge older theories on the transition from hunting and gathering to settled agricultural life in the Southwest will have to be revised and these new findings will also contribute to the long debate on the origin of the Hohokam people.
Survey data There are two kinds of surveys that archaeologists perform: Linear and block.
Linear survey involves inspecting a right-of-way for construction of a road, sewer line, telephone cable or other linear feature.
These surveys tend to be done in compliance with legal mandates requiring environmental studies during project planning.
Block survey involves examining non-linear properties ranging in size from a few acres to 1000s of acres.
These are typically done either in compliance with legal mandates, or through academic or preservation related research projects.
The Map entitled Archaeology Survey Locations shows the areas within the subarea that have been archaeologically surveyed and the sites that have been recorded.
It is evident that survey has been conducted primarily on private lands in the north and west half of the subarea.
Moreover, survey coverage has been achieved primarily through a great many small parcel and road right-of-way surveys that, with some notable exceptions, have focused along the Santa Cruz River, the Rillito River, and in the Catalina foothills.
This reflects the effect of laws requiring survey and excavation in advance of state highway projects and Pima County's cultural resources requirements for rezoning and grading for development.
The City of Tucson's historic preservation ordinance also requires archaeological investigations in some circumstances and these projects are also reflected.
Presented below is a breakdown of survey data by acreage and survey type including the percentage of the subarea that has been investigated.
Table IV.8.2.
Middle Santa Cruz Subarea - Survey Acreage by Survey Type Survey Type Number Acres Surveyed Percent of Subarea Linear 757 7521 2.0 Block 749 16,623 4.6 Total 1506 24,144 6.6
The survey total indicates that despite numerous surveys conducted within the subarea, only a small portion of the landscape has been intensively investigated, and that conversely the vast majority of the land within the subarea, over 93 percent, has not.
Despite this shortcoming, a large number of cultural resources, representing thousands of years of human occupation, are reported within the Middle Santa Cruz Valley subarea.
The most abundant cultural resource within the Middle Santa Cruz Valley subarea is not archaeological but architectural in nature.
The dense clusters of red triangles seen in the downtown Tucson area on the archaeology survey map are actually historic buildings that were assigned identifiers in the Arizona State Museum archaeological data base.
This represent a total of 3988 historic buildings and includes hundreds of residences and related structures located within Tucson's 16 Historic Districts (see National Register Properties below).
This is the only subarea in Pima County where historic resources have received anything equal to the research attention that archaeological sites have.
Site Data - Chronology Table IV.8.3 presents information on the number of prehistoric sites in the subarea by time period as reported by the Arizona State Museum.
These data represent the latest information on site counts per time period.

*Includes 31 sites that have both Archaic and Ceramic Period occupations
While no sites dating to the PaleoIndian Period have yet been reported in the subarea, a few sites have been found to the east along the San Pedro River Valley.
Several diagnostic spear points have also been found in the Tucson Mountains, within Saguaro National Monument East, and near Oracle Junction to the north, which at least demonstrate the presence of PaleoIndian People in the vicinity.
The term "PaleoIndian" describes the earliest period of human occupation in the Americas.
This was a time following the end of the last ice age when the environment was cooler and wetter than it is today.
Many species of now extinct animals including mammoth, horse, camel, bear, bison, and lions lived during this period.
Numerous archaeological sites found in the west indicate that hunting these large animals was an important part of the subsistence of PaleoIndian people, and as such, archaeologists refer to them as "big game hunters."
While very little is known about these people, it is believed that they lived in small groups or bands by hunting and gathering wild foods as they became seasonably available throughout the year.
Archaeological evidence suggest that they were highly mobile covering thousands of square miles in a year as they moved across the landscape.
Early in the succeeding Archaic Period, the environment became warmer, the large game animals disappeared, and modern plant and animal species were established.
The Archaic Period is minimally represented in the subarea with 34, none of which can be more accurately dated.
The Archaic Period represent a time span of almost 8000 years during which human beings adjusted their way of living in response to new environmental conditions.
In order to survive, people became generalists in their subsistence practices, hunting and gathering a wide variety of plants and animals and becoming more efficient in how they processed their food as indicated by the presence of grinding stones found on sites of this period.
Again, people appeared to have lived in small groups by hunting a gathering wild plants and animals over large areas through a seasonal round.
Sites from the early and middle parts of the Archaic are rare in southern Arizona suggesting low population levels in response to the unfavorable environmental conditions believed to exist at that time; however, toward the end of the period several significant changes occurred laying the foundation for subsequent cultural development.
First, the environment stabilized by 4500 years ago approaching modern conditions by that time.
Second, population levels appear to have increased and some evidence suggests that people roamed within more restricted territories as a result.
Third, by approximately 3500 years ago, people began to experiment with growing their own food as a supplement to their diet.
This change also co-occurred with more permanent settlement along well watered reaches of the major drainages in the region.
Research conducted within the last five years along the Santa Cruz River flood plain has confirmed the presence of settled village sites occupied by late Archaic people who practiced agriculture, utilized canal irrigation, and were experimenting with ceramic technology as early as 3000 years ago.
These developments push back the origins of settled agricultural existence in prehistory at least 1000 years from the previously established dates for the region.
A total of 305 sites dating to the Ceramic Period are known within the subarea indicating intensive use of the Middle Santa Cruz Valley during this time in prehistory.
The Ceramic Period covers the time between the adoption of ceramic technology in the third and fourth centuries after Christ to the end of the prehistoric sequence around A.D. 1540.
It was during the early part of the period, between approximately A.D. 200 to A.D. 700, that Archaic Period populations completed the transition from mobile hunting and gathering to settled, village based, agricultural existence in southern Arizona and elsewhere.
The principal pottery bearing people in the region during prehistory were the Hohokam, who emerged as a distinct culture in the eighth century and dominated central and southern Arizona until around A.D. 1450.
The Hohokam flourished along the river valleys of southern Arizona, including the Santa Cruz Valley, but were also well adapted to the desert lands to the west.
They lived in settled, permanent villages, grew their own food using irrigation and dry farming techniques, developed a rich ceremonial life, and traded extensively with their neighbors throughout the region.
A period of environmental instability during the A.D. 1300s is believed by some to have weakened the agricultural economy to the point where the Hohokam were no longer able to produce food in sufficient quantifies and with enough consistency to support large populations.
Other theories suggest that warfare or disease may have destabilized the social system leading to decline.
Whatever the cause, the Hohokam culture collapsed around A.D. 1450.
Following the collapse of the Hohokam, the region is believed to have been occupied in very low numbers by an O'odham (upper Piman speaking) people whose settlement and subsistence practices reflect a return to an earlier, simpler way of living.
Life continued to involve the cultivation of crops supplemented by hunting a gathering, but the level of technical sophistication and social and religious cohesion characteristic of the Hohokam is missing in these later populations.
These people are believed to be the descendants of the Hohokam, but are recognized as separate culture groups.
Archaeologists know very little about the period that represents the end of the Hohokam and the beginning of the Spanish Colonial presence in southern Arizona.
It appears to have been a time of flux when the vacuum left by the disappearance of the Hohokam was filled by groups that the Spanish recognized as the Sobaipuri and the Tohono O'odham in the 17th and 18th centuries.
When the first Europeans arrived in the Tucson area, they found seasonally occupied settlements, called rancherias, at the base of Sentinel Peak and at San Xavier a few miles to the south.
Other settlements were present along the San Pedro and Gila Rivers and west of Tucson on what is now the Tohono O'odham reservation.

Table IV.8.4 presents archaeological data on the Historic Period, spanning the years between A.D. 1540 and 1950.
The history of the Middle Santa Cruz Subarea can be viewed in terms of the settlement of the Santa Cruz River Valley.
In 1691, Father Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit priest, began a series of trips into the Pimeria Alta to meet with the native population.
This resulted in the construction of the mission church at the village of San Xavier del Bac starting in 1700 south of Tucson and the founding of a large church at Guevavi in the Upper Santa Cruz Valley, north of modern day Nogales.
The introduction of Christianity changed the native ways of life profoundly.
Livestock, wheat, and other domesticated plants and animals were added to the economy.
Diseases introduced by the Europeans wiped out entire Indian villages and the native settlements of Sonora and Arizona were reorganized with a new focus on mission communities.
Presidios, or forts, established by the Spanish at strategic places, originally for protection from the Apaches, were also occasionally used to keep the usually friendly Pimans in check.
This was of particular concern to the Spanish in the years between 1734 and 1760 when Piman populations were agitating against Colonial rule culminating in the Pima Revolt of 1751.
Following these events, Spanish security concerns focused on the Apaches, who threatened Spanish outposts all along the northern frontier.
The need for defense prompted the Spanish to establish a presidio at Tubac in 1752, which was later removed to the location of Tucson in 1775.
On August 20th of that year, Don Hugo O'Connor founded the Presidio of San AgustÃ¯Â¿Â½n del TuquisÃ¯Â¿Â½n on the east side of the Santa Cruz River in the approximate location of what is today El Presidio Park Plaza.
Only a few months later in October, 1775, Captain Juan Bautista de Anza set off from Tubac in October, passed down the Santa Cruz River Valley through the settlement at Tucson turning west along the Gila River and journeyed on to the Pacific Coast culminating in the founding of San Francisco.
During these early years, the existence of Tucson as a viable settlement hung in the balance.
Despite the presence of Spanish military personnel, the Apaches pretty much helped themselves to the livestock and colonists lost their lives in the hinter lands.
The most serious event in Tucson's young history came in 1782 in the form of a full scale Apache assault in which 600 warriors attacked the Presidio very nearly ending Spain's colonial experiment in the Pimeria Alta.
The pace of construction on the wall surrounding the settlement picked up shortly thereafter.
Despite the hostility of the locals, Tucson survived and in 1800 the church constructed the mission of San Augistin, referred thereafter as the Convento, on the west side of the Santa Cruz River in the shadow of Sentinel Peak.
By 1804, a total of 1015 souls called Tucson home.
In the later years of the Spanish Colonial period, ranching, mining, and agriculture were the principal economic activities in the Santa Cruz Valley and elsewhere.
This was a time of relative peace until the Mexican War of Independence ended the colonial period in 1821.
The missionization and military protection programs of the Spanish colonial government encouraged an influx of Spanish colonists early in the 18th century that eventually brought and end to the dispersed pattern of Indian Villages along the length of the Santa Cruz River.
The Santa Cruz Valley became dominated by the inhabitants of Spanish and Mexican decent who survived mainly by farming, ranching, and trade.
Apaches began raiding extensively in southern Arizona after 1830 and were a major threat to the Mexican Settlements.
The Mexican war of 1846 and subsequent transfer of the Gadsden purchase to U.S. ownership in 1854 were the primary historical events leading to the end of Spanish and Mexican domination of the Santa Cruz Valley.
By the time of the Gadsden purchase, Spanish and later Mexican settlements were well established, and ranching and mining had replaced much of the traditional agricultural subsistence base.
In Tucson, not much had changed since the turn of the 19th century, however.
Population within the settlement declined to a low of about 460 people in the 1830s that picked up somewhat with the influx of miners who passed though the settlement in the late 1840s on their way to the gold fields of California.
What the Americans saw in 1856 when U.S. troops took control of the presidio from the Mexican Army was a small village of about one thousand people living inside and close to the fort.
The residents grew crops in the bottom lands nearby, raised cattle and sheep, and watched for attack from the Apache Indians.
Shortly thereafter things began to change.
The Butterfield Overland Mail Company route passed through the subarea during its short operations between 1858 and 1861.
This was one of the first long distance mail carriers to be established linking the southwestern territories with the rest of the United States.
Contracted by the federal government, the company offered mail service between Saint Louis, Missouri and San Francisco, California along a route that included stations spaced every 20 miles on average.
The stations were to provide food, grain, water, ammunition, and equipment for mending coaches and shoeing mules and horses.
One of these stations was located in Tucson itself near what is now Pearl and Pennington Streets.
The outbreak of the civil war lead to the abandonment of the Butterfield line.
During the war, Tucson was briefly occupied by the Confederacy in 1862, only to be reclaimed by Union Troops a short time later.
Skirmishes between Union and confederate forces near Pichacho Pass were some of the western most engagements of the civil war.
Arizona officially became a territory in 1863.
National politics, and the presence of proven mineral wealth, convinced President Abraham Lincoln to recognize Arizona as a territory separate from that of New Mexico and Prescott was selected as the first territorial capital.
Tucson should have been chosen being the most important settlement in the territory, but at the time it was believed that Tucson had too many southern sympathizers.
After the war, ranching and mining dominated the territorial economy and brought in Anglo-Americans in search of gold, silver, copper and other minerals.
However, lumbering and farming also contributed as economic opportunities expanded.
Continued confrontation with the Apaches prompted the establishment of a permanent US military presence throughout southern Arizona, and a number of posts, camps, and forts sprung from Tubac to Holbrook including Fort Lowell, established 10 miles north and west of Tucson in 1873.
The war with the Apaches ended in 1886 with the surrender of Geronimo ushering a period of peace and prosperity.
With the coming of the railroad in 1880, Tucson became connected to the rest of the nation, bringing greater population growth and a more commercially oriented economy.
Meanwhile, Tucson began to see the results of progress.
Amenities came in rapid succession with Telegraph lines being installed in 1873, followed by a telephone system in 1881, and then gas, electricity, and city water in 1882.
One of the least appreciated events at the time, but perhaps one of the most important for the future of Tucson, occurred in 1885 when the Territorial legislature in Prescot awarded Tucson the authority to build the University of Arizona.
This came about through some late night horse trading whereby it was decided that Prescott would remain the territorial capital, Yuma would get the prison, Phoenix would get the mental hospital, and Tucson would get the U, which unfortunately did not have an appropriation that went with it.
The citizens of Tucson were outraged and the man responsible for this disaster was forced to hire a body guard.
In any event, ground breaking the university was held on October 27, 1887 and the University officially opened on October 1, 1891.
Statehood came to Arizona in 1912 after many fruitless years of trying to convince the Congress of the Territory's worthiness.
Statehood also resulted in the establishment of the state trust lands that still to this day cover vast territory throughout southern Arizona, including Pima County.
The establishment of the US Forrest Service (1905) prior to statehood and the Bureau of Land Management afterwards (1946) had a tremendous impact on rural life in the region including the Santa Cruz Valley adding forest and range management requirements to lands that traditionally had none.
Tucson by the time of statehood had grown beyond the confines of the historic downtown core, which for many years was characterized by a north south axis along the Santa Cruz River and growth shifted east.
Twenty-three thousand people lived in Tucson at the time, which would remain the largest city in the state until the 1920s when Phoenix surpassed it thereafter.
The effects of the first and second World Wars cannot be overstated in that each of these national convulsions brought an influx of people and technology to southern Arizona making Tucson the main population center in the region.
Copper mining became a major economic force in the area including the east flanks of the Sierrita Mountains, but farming and ranching continued to be important in the Santa Cruz Valley and elsewhere.
The Davis-Monthan airfield opened in 1927 adding air travel to train transport, and automobile travel, still in its infancy.
As a center of health care, Tucson attracted thousands of people from all over the country to its sunny and arid climate beginning in the 1890s and continuing well into the 1920s.
Tourism too began to draw people into the area and the hospitality industry responded.
It was during this time, for instance, that the El Conquistador Hotel (1925) and the Arizona Inn (1931) were built and dude ranches became popular as source of rural relaxation.
The Depression brought hard times to Tucson, still a small town by national standards.
The boom that came with World War II, however, changed the city's fortunes and thousands of serviceman were stationed at the air base.
Following the war, many of these same servicemen settled in Tucson to raise families and rapid population growth ensued.
In 1940, there were approximately 35,000 people within the city limits.
By 1960, this number jumped to a little more than 212,000 people a six fold increase in twenty years.
By 1980 330,000 people lived in Tucson and today the population rate is almost 483,000 with almost another 400,000 living in Pima County.
As a result of this demographic trend, urbanization has filled the Middle Santa Cruz subarea in all areas with the exception of federal lands (Saguaro National Monument, Coronado National Forest), County lands (Tucson Mountain Park), and some state lands in the southeastern corner of the subarea near Pantano Wash.
Regionally, growth has begun to expand out from Tucson up the Upper Santa Cruz Valley and into the adjoining basins as new communities have become established in what was once open range along the valley floors.
Today, Tucson's tremendous success threatens the record of its past as never before.
A total of 93 Historic Period sites have been identified in the subarea by the Arizona State Museum, 53 of which are Euro-American, 18 are Mexican in ethnic origin.
There are twelve sites attributed to the Tohono O'odham, two have been identified as Spanish and the cultural identity of eight sites is unknown.
Low sample size, the greater visibility of some sites and not others, and a lack of research interest in the archaeology of the historic time period distorts the true picture of historic period land use in the subarea.
Given the long history of the Tucson area, it is certain that archaeological remains associated with the trends discussed above exist within the subarea with varying degrees of integrity.
Site Data - Function The site data from both the historic and prehistoric eras can also be examined from a functional perspective to highlight land use trends within the subarea.
The following is a summary of archaeological site data for the subarea that is presented by gross time period and site function.
These data are made available by the Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona.
Table IV.8.5.

The site counts presented in Table IV.8.5 show that prehistoric sites out number the historic by less than five to one and that in 60 instances, occupations from both major time periods are present on the same site.
The prehistoric site counts are dominated by Resource Processing (food and non food resources) and Habitation (residential) uses, which is typical of the functional data from other subareas.
Food, shelter and non-food resources are critical for life everywhere.
Agriculture (i.e. fields, water control features) is next with 10 sites followed by Art, meaning rock art, and Religion, both of which are represented by eight sites each.
Resource Procurement (food and non food resources), Disposal (trash) and Storage appear in small numbers and may reflect more of a bias in recording than in actual presence in the archaeological record.
As is the case in the other subareas in Pima County, the largest number of prehistoric sites cannot be functionally identified based on survey data.
The historic sites emphasize residential needs over all others, with Habitation being the primary functional category represented with 29 sites.
What follows next are sites classified with a governmental or civic function with 22 sites.
This is the highest number of sites with this particular use identified anywhere in Pima County and is consistent with the role of Tucson as a center of power during the historic period.
Sites classifiable as Disposal, or trash dumps, are next with 15, followed by five sites identified as being agricultural in nature.
Resource Processing and Religion are represented with two sites each, and sites with Storage and Transportation functions are barely represented with one site each.
The low number of sites associated with resource processing stands in contrast to the high number of such sites that are prehistoric in age.
This may be a function of the differences in economic organization between the historic and prehistoric occupations.
Resource processing during prehistoric times almost always involves features used for cooking food, whereas during the historic era, sites used for resource processing are often associated with mining or other industrial activities.
Again, sample bias in the collection of data from the historic period distorts the evidence, but nonetheless, part of the explanation may lie in the very different ways in which prehistoric and historic people made their living.
This is the same pattern observed in the data from the Tortolita Fan Subarea.
Fifteen of the sixty sites with both prehistoric and historic occupations on them can be functionally identified as having uses associated with Habitation, followed in order by Disposal and Resource Processing with four sites each.
Agriculture and Transportation are present with two sites each, and Art, Resource Procurement, and Religion are last with one site each.
There are also 130 sites where function can be determined but age cannot, with Resource Processing (15), Habitation (5), Agriculture (5) and Government (3) being the first, second, and third site types listed by order of rank.
Minor site counts exist for Disposal, Religion, Storage and Transportation.
It is likely that many of the Resource Processing and Habitation sites are Native American, possibly O'odham, but lack diagnostic artifacts to confirm their identity.
Euro-American sites are usually pretty straightforward because of the distinctive characteristics of the material culture including glass, metal, pottery, etc.
Of all sites from both the prehistoric and historic time period, the data presented in Table 5 indicates that site use within the subarea is equally split between Habitation and Resource Processing of food and non-food items with 104 sites each, the latter being dominated by prehistoric sites with these functional uses.
Government functions are second in overall count at 28, being dominated by historic period sites and this is followed in third by sites identified as having disposal as the primary function represented by 24 sites; these too are largely historic in origin.
Agricultural is fourth in rank with 22 sites, Religion is fifth with 13, most of which are prehistoric in origin, and Art is sixth.
This use category is also dominated by sites in the prehistoric column.
Resource procurement is minimally represented with five sites and Storage and Transportation are tied for last in order with four site each.
Not surprisingly, the vast majority of those sites that could be functionally identified relate to housing and processing food and non food resources.
Again, it is interesting to see the contrast between the historic and prehistoric representation of Government as a site function, being present only in the historic era, whereas the situation is reversed for sites classified as Resource Processing.
As noted, these patterns are surely affected by the bias inherent in the data, but can nonetheless be argued to reflect differences in how prehistoric and historic populations have used the subarea over time.
To sum the information on archaeological sites, the Middle Santa Cruz subarea has witnessed a combination of archaeological survey and site excavation that has informed upon the past and is breaking new ground, so to speak.
Still only a very small fraction of the subarea has been ever investigated.
Because of this, site distribution is largely a reflection of where investigation has occurred than past land use patterning.
Even so, it is possible to make a few summary statements based on the archaeological record:
1) It is evident that human beings have occupied the Middle Santa Cruz Valley subarea for many thousands of years and recent study of the Santa Cruz River flood plain suggests that the origins of sedentary village life, agriculture, and irrigation technology occurred far earlier than previously reported.
The subarea has experienced two peaks in occupation, the first occurring in prehistory during the period between A.D. 200 and A.D. 1300, and the second occurring after 1775.
3) Certain parts of the landscape have been more heavily utilized than others especially along the margins of the Santa Cruz River, the Rillito River and its tributaries where surface water has been available.
4) The predominant use of the landscape relates to housing and processing both food and non food resources for the two major time periods; however, significant differences in social and economic organization between the prehistoric and historic populations that can be inferred from the data.
B. Historical Resources "Historical resources are sites, districts, structures, objects, or other evidences of human activities that represent facets of the history of the nation, state, or locality.
Also places where significant historical or unusual events occurred even though no evidence of the event remains, or places associated with persons significant in our history that have gained importance in the last 50 years" (Preserving Cultural and Historic Resources, Pima County, May 1999).
Historical resources are largely constructed or engineered elements of the built environment including buildings used for residential purposes, such as houses, but also commercial stores, industrial facilities, civic centers, and places of worship.
Roads, bridges, irrigation canals, mining works, and railroad tracks are also historical resources.
Information on these places is recovered through drawings and design plans, photographs, maps, surveys, and personal recollections.
The Middle Santa Cruz subarea has a large number of places of historic importance including the City of Tucson, itself a historic community; places that have been recognized for their historic value and registered on the National Register of Historic Places; and, two historic trails.
Historic Communities: Historic Communities are those settlements that were established 50 or more years ago as indicated by either a founding date or the date the post office first opened.
The following description is derived from "Tucson" by C. L. Sonnichsen, University of Oklahoma Press, 1982
Tucson: The name of the modern city of Tucson is derived from the Piman word "Stjukson" meaning "at the foot of the black hill or mountain," which was given to the Indian settlement at the base of Sentinel Peak (A Mountain).
Father Eusebio Kino first visited the subarea in 1691 and in 1700 built the first of several mission churches at the village of Bac located several miles south and west of the present downtown.
In 1775 Don Hugo O'Connor, acting under the authority of the King of Spain founded the Presidio of San AgustÃ¯Â¿Â½n del TuquisÃ¯Â¿Â½n, a fortified village, in roughly the same location as the present day El Presidio Park Plaza.
This settlement became the nucleus of European colonial occupation on the northern frontier that has survived to the present day from Spanish Colonial times, through the Mexican and U.S. Territorial eras, through statehood and finally the post World War II population boom, which laid the foundation for the modern metropolis that characterizes the city today.
National Register Properties: The National Register of Historic Places was created as a part of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.
It is the nation's premier honor roll for places deemed of national, regional, or local historic importance.
The criteria for listing include: a) association with a person who has contributed to history; b) association with an event important to history; c) associated with the work of a master artist or craftsman or typical of a style or type of workmanship; d) yielding or having the potential to yield information important to history or prehistory.
Listing in no way effects the rights of private property owners to do what they wish with their property.
Federal agencies; however, are required to consider the effects of their actions on listed properties.
There are one hundred National Register Properties in the Middle Santa Cruz subarea, including 16 Historic Districts as shown on the map entitled, "National Register Historic Districts."
In all, 3988 historic buildings and structures have been recorded in the Tucson area, almost all of which are included within these districts.
The districts are listed below along with the period of significance for which each was nominated to the National Register.
Table IV.8.6.
Middle Santa Cruz Subarea - National Register Districts
District Address Period Armory Park E. 12th St. to 19th St., Stone Ave. to 2nd Ave. 1880-early 1900s Barrio Libre Roughly bounded by 14th, 19th, Stone and Osborne Sts. 1863-1900 Colonia Solana Roughly bounded by Broadway Blvd., S. Randolph Way, Camino Campestre, and S. Country Club 1920s-1930s El Encanto Estates Roughly bounded by Country Club Rd., Broadway Blvd., Fifth St., 
Note: The City of Tucson has designated several local districts pursuant to its own preservation laws many of which are also on the National Register of Historic Places.
For example, Barrio Historico, is a city designated district subject to city preservation requirements that is physically within the limits of the Barrio Libre National Register District.
Other districts listed by the City through its own preservation ordinance that are also listed on the National Register include Armory Park, Fort Lowell, El Presidio and West University.
The San Xavier Environs is a City listed district that is not on the National Register.
For a complete listing of all National Register districts and individually listed properties see Appendix A.
Historic Trails: In many places, historic and prehistoric trails often become the basis for roads and modern highways and the Middle Santa Cruz subarea is no exception.
The references used are cited elsewhere in this document.
Anza Trail.
This is the route taken by Juan Bautista de Anza in the expedition of 1775-1776 when he lead a group of some 250 colonists and 1200 head of livestock from Sonora to found a presidio and mission for Spain at San Francisco Bay.
The trail extends from Nogales, Arizona to San Francisco, California, a distance of 1200 miles.
There are approximately 60 miles of trail in Pima County along the west bank of the Sant Cruz River, with six campsites at Canoa, Llano Grande (south of Sahuarita), San Xavier del Bac, Tucquison (north of downtown Tucson).
Llano del Azotado (at the north end of the Tucson Mountains), and Oitipars (near the Pinal County Line).
The Anza Trail has been nominated as a National Historic Trail by the National Park Service.
Today, Interstate 19 and portions of Interstate 10 follow the original route down the Santa Cruz Valley.
In the Subarea, the Anza Trail followed the west side of the Santa Cruz River.
Butterfield Stage Line.
The Butterfield Overland Company was one of the first continental mail carriers.
It opened in 1858 connecting St. Louis, Missouri and San Francisco, California; however, by 1861 it had ceased operations.
In Arizona, the company used parts of existing trails to forge a route some 437 miles in length.
In 1869, Wells Fargo operated over the old Butterfield stage lines and in the 1870s, the Southern Pacific railroad surveyed along the approximate route.
In the Middle Santa Cruz Subarea, the trail is believed to have entered into Tucson from the east following a trail that later was closely paralleled by the Southern Pacific Railroad crossing what is today the Davis-Monthan Air Base and then up Main Street to a stage station near what is now Pearl and Pennington Streets.
Leaving Tucson, the route headed north on the east side of the river, crossing west at Jaynes Station and following what is today Silverbell road passed two stops, Nine Mile Water Hole and Pointer Mountain, before crossing to the east again at the northern end of the Tucson Mountains.
To sum the discussion of historic resources, the subarea contains a variety of places that are symbolic of different historic forces that have affected southern Arizona and the nation as a whole from the founding of Tucson as a fortified village in the 18th century, to the Butterfield Overland Mail Route and the coming of the railroad, to the founding of the University of Arizona in 1885, to the establishment of Tucson as an important military base for both World Wars, and finally, the growth of Tucson as a regional urban center in recent years.
C.
Traditional Cultural Places "A traditional cultural place is a historic site or district that is important because of its association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community that (a) are rooted in that community's history, and (b) are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community.
The traditional cultural significance of an historic property is derived from the role the property plays in a community's historically rooted beliefs, customs, and practices" (Preserving Cultural and Historic Resources, Pima County, May 1991).
Pima County has been occupied by indigenous peoples for thousands of years and the modern descendants of these prehistoric cultures still live in the region today.
All of Pima County is claimed as ancestral lands by the Ak-Chin Indian Community, the Gila River Indian Community, and the Tohono O'odham Nation.
The Piman speaking groups (including the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community) claim direct ancestral affiliation with the prehistoric Hohokam Indians who inhabited much of southern and central Arizona.
Other Indian groups also claim ancestral ties to the Pima County area including the Zuni of central western New Mexico and the Hopi of northeastern Arizona based on oral histories and myth that identify southern Arizona as a place of origin for these tribes.
The Apaches also lived in the region for hundreds of years and therefore they too can claim an ancestral connection to the land and the places of traditional value to them that it may contain.
Other groups with potential claims to places of traditional cultural value include the Hispanic and Anglo communities.
Places of traditional cultural value, as defined, are special to the community and must often remain secret to non-members; this is particularly true among Native Americans.
These might be places where in the past natural resources were collected for ceremony or where natural features on the landscape are still recognized as having significance.
Other places with traditional cultural value of particular importance to Native Americans are rock art sites and all archaeological sites containing human graves.
Eight sites within the subarea are identified as prehistoric rock art localities, and in addition, fifty-three prehistoric sites were used for habitation; these sites often contain human graves.
It is reasonable to assume, that Native Americans would identify these places as having traditional cultural value.
More than likely, there are many places with these kinds of values that exist in the Middle Santa Cruz subarea.
The only well known traditional cultural place in the subarea is not Native American but Mexican-American in origin.
The following description is derived from the National Register form available at the State Historic Preservation Office in Phoenix, Arizona.
El Tiradito.
Otherwise known as the wishing shrine, this place is identified as the only shrine in the United State dedicated to the soul of a sinner in unconsecrated ground.
Its name means "the castaway" and the many legends about its origin all involve a tragic love affair in the early 1870s.
It is used as a place of petition where miracles can be granted.
The site was placed on the National Register in 1971.
III.
THREAT ASSESSMENT: The next map, entitled "Archaeological Sites and Land Ownership" shows the distribution of sites in relation to land status.
The data presented in this figure represent current information provide by the Arizona State Museum.
Again, the moss of sits shown in the downtown area are actually historic buildings.
Aside from these, however, it is apparent that most of the 737 archaeological sites plotted are located on private lands along the Santa Cruz and Rillito Rivers and in the Catalina Mountain Foothills.
A large number of sites are shown within the Saguaro National Monument Western District with a scattering of sites in the Coronado National Forest.
Sites have also been recorded on state lands in the southeast corner of the subarea.
The overall distribution shown on this map is a product of both where sites are located and where efforts have been made to find them.
Legal protections against unauthorized disturbances are afforded archaeological sites and other cultural and historical resources on state and federal lands, but only one law, the Arizona State Burial Protection Act, applies to private land.
Cultural resources on county lands are also covered by legal protections defined under county law and policy.
Data are presented in Table 7 below showing the number of archaeological sites by land status and degree of legal protection for cultural resources.
Table IV.8.7.
Middle Santa Cruz Subarea Archaeological Sites by Landownership and Legal Protection Jurisdiction No. of Archaeological Sites Protection Status/Level Military Reservations 8 Protected/high National Forest Lands 69 Protected/high National Parks/Monuments 205 Protected/high State Lands (Trust) 69 Protected/moderate Private Lands 386 Unprotected/low Total 737
A total of 282 of the 737 sites or 38% have high protection status, reflecting the relatively high percentage of federal lands in the subarea (37.8%).
Sixty-nine sites are on state lands and thus are moderately protected from public and private actions.
The remaining 386 sites, or 52.3%, have low protection status since they are located on private property.
Since state trust lands can be sold for development, and private lands are subject only to local zoning, 455 or 61.7% of the 737 known archaeological sites may be (or have already been) affected by future development in the subarea.
The majority of the land base in the subarea has never been archaeologically surveyed and most of the subarea has been heavily developed through urban expansion meaning that hundreds, even thousands of sites may potentially exist.
Site density estimates for the subarea calculated by dividing the total survey area (37.7 square miles) by the number of known sites (737) produces a figure of 19.5 sites per mile.
This is by far the highest site density estimate of all the subareas in Pima County and is influenced by three factors: 1) Prehistorically, the Middle Santa Cruz was one of the most densely occupied areas in all of Pima County for centuries; 2) Tucson has been the primary population center for Euro-Americans and other ethnic groups for more than 200 years and archaeological sites from the historic period contribute a high proportion to the overall site count, and; 3) most of the areas surveyed have been in close proximity to a water source and this inflates the site counts distorting any density estimates for the area as a whole.
The site density figures when applied to the whole of the subarea produces a figure of over 10,000 archaeological sites, which because of the bias in how the subarea has been surveyed is not useful.
Nonetheless, given the intensify of occupation that is known to have occurred within the subarea during both the prehistoric and historic periods, it is reasonable to assume that many thousands of archaeological sites exist in the subarea.
Moreover, 3988 historic buildings have been recorded making historic resources a significant part of the cultural resource base in the subarea.
Resource Loss: There is only one sources of cultural resource loss in the subarea: urbanization.
The map entitled, GAP Vegetation shows the extent of the urban area that has replaced the native vegetation.
Also shown are the locations of the known archaeological sites, and the 3988 historic buildings located near the historic core of Tucson.
Comparing this map against the map entitled, Modern Communities Transportation and Ownership demonstrates that virtually every piece of private property within the subarea has been developed to one degree or another, with some exceptions on the east and southeast edges.
The only other places that remain relatively intact within the urban area are City and County parks.
Given the destructive effect of development on cultural resources, particularly archaeological sites, and given the extent of urbanization within the subarea, it is reasonable to assume that the integrity of much of the archaeological record has been compromised to varying degrees.
This does not mean that there is no point in looking for archaeological sites within the urban area.
Archaeological research in cities around the world have demonstrated that important cultural deposits survive to the modern era, particularly younger deposits; however, preservation is often a matter of luck more than anything else where important cultural deposits happen to be buried under streets or saved in vacant lots.
Historic archaeology can be a powerful tool for learning about the history of urban areas, but because of the degree of disturbance must often be conducted in conjunction with historic maps; census, probate and tax records; historic photographs and the like, to make sense of what is found.
Historic Buildings too are affected by urbanization through the regular process of alteration, addition, and in some cases demolition.
The El Conquistador Hotel, one of Tucson's finest in the 1920s and 1930s is a good example of how a community can lose a treasured historic resource to the wrecking ball.
In other cases, the process is slow and occurs by many individual acts.
The loss of the Presidio wall surrounding the 18th and early 19th century settlement of Tucson happened this way as people tore down a section of the wall here or borrowed some of the adobe bricks there.
The largest single event resulting in the lose of the historic fabric of the city occurred as a result of improvements to the downtown area sponsored by the federal government through the urban renewal program.
Development of El Presidio Park Plaza destroyed whole neighborhoods.
Thus, over the years, many historic resources within the subarea have been lost as a result of the cumulative effect of many individual actions as well as government construction and redevelopment programs.
Resource Threat: The greatest threat to cultural resources of all kinds is continued urbanization at the outer edges of the urban form, as well as within the city on vacant land.
Approximately 40% of the city area is vacant and as population continues to grow, these lands will become more attractive for development especially so if through the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan, growth is slowed and redirected in the county.
Archaeological sites will continue to be threatened by development within the urban core from both public works projects and private development.
Since it can be assumed that much of the archaeological record has already been affected, saving what has survived becomes even more imperative.
While the City of Tucson has a preservation ordinance in place, its application to situations where archaeological sites may be damaged by development is limited.
Historic resources will also continue to be threatened.
While there are 16 National Register Districts and many more individually listed properties, these places are only the ones that have received attention and many more are deserving of that attention.
The truth is that placing a property on the National Register does not prevent its destruction, it only excludes the owner from tax benefits that come from maintaining the historic character of the property.
More stringent protections are afforded through local preservation law, but in reality more places are lost than are ever saved.
Thus, continued urbanization within the subarea, both at the edges of the current urban form and within the urbanized area will continue to pose a threat to cultural resources in the future.
Sensitivity Zone: Archaeological survey coverage within the subarea is very low at 6.1% and as a result the distribution of archaeological sites in particular, is not clearly understood.
In an effort to predict areas with high sensitivity for cultural and historical resources, proximity to water is used as an objective predictor; this assumes that in the desert places closer to water will tend to have been used more heavily by past human populations than places more removed from water sources.
The map entitled Cultural Resources High Sensitivity Areas identifies zones within the subarea that are predicted to be highly sensitive for cultural resources.
The model encompasses the Santa Cruz River corridor, the Rillito River, the Tanque Verde Creek and Pantano Wash, as well a series of springs in the Catalina Mountains and Rincon Mountains.
Different buffers widths are used for the sensitivity model.
The Rivers are buffered by two miles on either side for a total of four miles in width.
The springs receive a one mile buffer around them as does the area of shallow ground water shown in green.
The distribution of known archaeological sites is also provided in this figure and demonstrates that many, but not all known sites are captured within the sensitivity zones.
The buffers used are arbitrary and the statistical efficacy of the model is untested, even so this projection provides and idea of where common sense would predict sites to be located.
The buffered areas capture the distribution of known sites along the major drainages as predicted.
It also picks up a lot of the sites along the foothills of the Rincon Mountains and the Catalina Mountains near springs and in proximity to shallow ground water.
The historic core of Tucson is included because of its proximity to the Santa Cruz.
Obviously, proximity to surface water is not the only factor that conditioned human behavior in the past.
Nonetheless, the model does appear to work with sufficient capacity as a good guess where cultural resources, particularly those associated with habitation, can be expected to be found.
It is also remarkably consistent with where the expert opinion of local archaeologists predict that the remains of past land use should be found.
The model has the advantage of also allowing for an estimate of how much of the archaeological record may have been impacted by the scale of development that has occurred within the city limits over the years.
As mentioned, a site density estimate of approximately 19 sites per square mile is derived from survey data; however the data largely reflect investigations in proximity to areas with water.
The sensitivity model just presented captures 190,379 acres from drainages, springs and shallow ground water totaling 297.4 square miles.
At 19 sites per mile, this area could potentially contain as many 5651 archaeological sites.
Site estimate along the Santa Cruz River south of Green Valley and along the Cienega Creek average around 9 or 10 sites.
With the added effect of the historic archaeological record the number of sites in the Tucson area can be expected to be greater, but may not be as high as 19 sites per square mile in all areas close to water.
Thus, if a range of site density between 10 and 19 sites per square mile is used, a range of potential sites within the subarea can be estimated.
Taking this approach something on the order of between 3000 and 5600 archaeological sites from all time periods is derived.
This assumes that virtually no sites will be found in those areas outside of the buffered zones.
While no area will be completely devoid of archaeological sites, low numbers are generally found within the subarea when located at distance from water.
Therefore, while a number ranging from 3000 to 5600 sites is higher than the site estimates for other subareas examined in Pima County, given the importance of the middle Santa Cruz area as a focus of human habitation, this figure seems reasonable.
Given the extent of development, however, it can also be assumed that many of these sites have been damaged or destroyed.
IV.
SUMMARY: The cultural resources of the Middle Santa Cruz Subarea are the product of thousands of years of human settlement from the earliest prehistoric times to the modern day.
In that sense, they represent a collective history of this portion of eastern Pima County and can inform and educate future generations about the past.
But cultural resources are non renewable: there are only so many archaeological sites, historic buildings or places with traditional cultural value, and once they are gone there are no replacements.
It is for this reason that Pima County has included cultural resources in its planning for the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan.
This report provides information on known cultural resources within the subarea describing their nature and distribution and attempts to predict where other cultural resources may be found.
In this case, more may be actually known about historic resources that about the archaeological record reflecting a very high degree of effort on the part of the citizens of Tucson to recognize and protect their historic neighborhoods and landmarks.
Like many of the subareas that have been studied as part of the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan, the Middle Santa Cruz subarea has received a relatively low level of archaeological research attention over the years.
Despite a few notable exceptions, most research attention in the past was directed away from the city into the unspoiled hinterland where sites were still visible and accessible.
That has changed as the dictates of modern cultural resources management require examination of areas that would not have been investigated in the past, including much of the city area and those portions of the county that are currently undergoing rapid development.
From the body of research as a whole, however, it is evident that people have lived in the subarea for thousands of years.
However, unlike other subareas there were two periods of peak population: one during late prehistory between A.D. 700 and A.D. 1450 when the subarea was occupied by the Hohokam Indians, and the second beginning in the 18th century with the founding of Tucson by the Spanish.
Both the indigenous peoples and the European newcomers clearly thrived in the desert along the Santa Cruz River and learned to overcome the harshness of the environment to make a living and the vestiges of their settlements still exit within the subarea.
The construction of the mission of Saint Augustine, the building of the Presidio on the east side of the Santa Cruz River, and the passage of the Spanish along the Anza Trail in the 18th century all represents an era of exploration and conquest that forever changed the history of the land.
Later, the Butterfield stage line would retrace portions of the former trail through the subarea as mail was carried from Saint Louis to San Francisco.
The coming of the railroad in 1880 linked Tucson to the world and allowed it to prosper in a harsh land.
New neighborhoods were added to the old as Tucson pushed east from the banks of the river beginning in the late 19th century.
Many of these residences are now included within the 16 Historic Districts and 84 individual properties that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places for Tucson.
The site of El Tiradito represents a traditional cultural place that is special to the city's large Mexican-American community.
Lastly, Native American claims identify the subarea as part of their traditional use areas and the possibility that places with traditional cultural value exist in the subarea is high, especially those associated with the surrounding mountains.
In short, the subarea has a rich record of cultural and historical resources with high scientific, educational, and recreational values.
Yet the Middle Santa Cruz subarea, containing the City of Tucson and portions of its metropolitan suburbs, is undergoing accelerated change driven by population growth and the resulting development pressures.
These changes threaten what is left of the cultural resources in the urban area.
Ironically, these are the very resources that can tell us about the historical forces that created the city that is now consuming them.
Clearly, there is a need to identify cultural and historical resources, evaluate their significance, and where warranted protect the record of the past for the future.

Middle Santa Cruz Subarea
I. SUBAREA: The subarea defines the watersheds formed by the Santa Catalina Mountains on the north, the Rincon mountains on the east, and the Tucson Mountains to the west.
The southern boundary follows a line running south of Interstate 10 and north of the San Xavier District.
This area drains the Santa Cruz River and its tributary, the Rillito River, which in turn is fed by the Tanque Verde Creek, Agua Caliente Wash and Pantano Wash as indicated on the map entitled, "Modern Communities, Transportation, and Ownership."
The subarea encompasses approximately 565 square miles and contains southern Arizona's primary urban settlement, the City of Tucson and its outlying metropolitan areas.
The Middle Santa Cruz subarea contains approximately 361, 852 acres, within which land status is broken down as presented in the table below.
Unlike most of eastern Pima County where state trust land makes up the majority of the land base, in this subarea, private lands rank first.
Federal lands in Catalina, Rincon and the Tucson Mountains come second, state trust lands are third, followed by the military reservation at the Davis-Monthan Air Base, Pima County Park lands in Tucson Mountain Park, and lastly Tribal lands belonging to the Tohono O'odham San Xavier District as indicated in the table below.
Table IV.8.1.
Middle Santa Cruz Subarea - Land Ownership by Acres and Percent Ownership Acres Percentage Bureau of Land Management 125 
The year 2000 population estimate for the Middle Santa Cruz subarea is 697,947 making it the most densely populated subarea in Pima County and second only to Phoenix in the state of Arizona.
The subarea includes the City of Tucson and the community of Summerhaven at the top of the Catalina Mountains.
Tucson is a heavily urbanized area that is rapidly growing and future growth projections put the combined population of Tucson and adjoining Pima County at over one million by the year 2010.
Historically, the subarea included farming and ranching, but those activities have been completely replaced by commercial, residential, and transportation related development.
II.
CULTURAL RESOURCES: This section presents information and analysis of current data on archaeological sites, historic resources and traditional cultural places within the subarea.
A. Archaeological sites "Archaeological sites are any material remains of past human life or activities which are preserved in their original setting that are important to understanding prehistory or history.
These sites or districts may include occupation sites, work areas, farming sites, burials and other funerary remains, artifacts, campsites, hearths, rock art, intaglios, trails, battle sites, religious or ceremonial sites, caves and rock shelters, the architectural or other remains of structures of all kinds, such as pit houses, pueblo rooms, adobe or rock foundations, and other domestic features, usually dating from prehistoric or aboriginal periods, or from historic periods at least 50 years old, for which only archaeological vestiges remain" (Preserving Cultural and Historic Resources, Pima County, May 1999).
Archaeologists learn about the past by collecting and analyzing information in two ways: through survey and by excavation.
Survey involves inspecting the ground surface in a particular area and recording concentrations of artifacts and features (hearths, roasting pits, pit houses, etc.) as archaeological sites.
A site represents the physical remains of past human behavior in a single location dating to one or more periods of use through time.
Surveys are often done systematically by groups of archaeologist who walk the land in regularly spaced lines looking for artifacts.
Some surveys, however, are judgmental in that archaeologists only look where sites are expected to be found and not elsewhere.
In all cases, survey offers an extensive perspective on past land use.
The second kind of information on archaeological sites is gained through excavation.
This is the systematic recording, recovery, and analysis of artifacts and features from within a site's limits.
Critical information is gained by understanding the spatial relationship of all artifacts and features within a three dimensional context.
This enables interpretation about how the site was used, by whom, when, whether the site was used more than once and what happened after it was abandoned.
Often, archaeological sites are not fully excavated but are only partially sampled.
This saves what is left of the site for future investigations.
Archaeological excavation provides highly detained information about the use of one limited spatial area during one or more use episodes.
Archaeologist use survey information in conjunction with site excavation information to build regional time lines over broad areas such as a river valley.
Previous Research A complete summary of the archaeological history of the subarea is not possible in this space; however, some highlights of that history are presented below.
As is the case elsewhere within Pima County, archaeological research began in the early part of the 20th century when archaeology as an intellectual discipline was in its infancy.
In 1910, Ellsworth Huntington recorded two Hohokam village sites in the foothills of the Catalina Mountains.
The Gibbons Spring Site and nearby Sabino Canyon ruin demonstrated the presence of prehistoric settlements in the upper bajadas in close proximity to natural springs and both sites were subject to excavation in later years.
Byron Cummings, head of the anthropology department at the University of Arizona sent his students into the Rincon Valley, one of whom, Emil Haury excavated at Tanque Verde Ruin in 1927.
In 1936, Isabel Kelly excavated the Hodges ruin, one of the largest Hohokam sites in the Tucson Basin.
Located at the confluence of the Satna Cruz and Rillito Rivers, this site was occupied repeatedly over time and Kelly's well controlled excavation stood as one of the only sources of information on the Pre-Classic period in the Hohokam archaeological sequence for many years.
In 1940, Julian Hayden excavated at the University Indian Ruin, a large Hohokam village located near the confluence of the Tanque Verde Creek and the Pantano Wash.
The work at this site was directed at the Classic Period (A.D. 1150 - A.D. 1450) that followed the main occupation of the Hodges Ruin.
Hayden's research contributed to the development of a regional chronology and an aerial synthesis, which were the primary objectives of archaeological research up until the middle 1960s.
During these years, the discipline of archaeology underwent a theoretical transformation and new environmental laws were passed that mandated archaeological investigations in advance of federally funded construction.
These changes shifted the focus of research from chronology to questions relating to cultural evolution and greatly expanded the pace and extent of archaeological study throughout the region.
One of the first studies to reflect this new orientation was the excavation project conducted at Punta del Agua near San Xavier in 1965-1966.
This research effort attempted to recover information on changes in social organization of the Hohokam Indians over time.
Shortly thereafter major changes in downtown Tucson were initiated through the Tucson Urban Renewal Project.
This large scale federally funded improvement project started in 1967 and ultimately resulted in the construction of the new civic plaza and related facilities in the heart of the historic core of Tucson.
Over the years, whole city blocks associated with the early history of Tucson were razed; however, this also provided an opportunity to look at historic archaeological deposits in Tucson.
While limited testing of historic deposits was conducted in the vicinity of the remains of the Convento and the Presidio in the 1940s and 1950s, archaeological research aimed specifically at historic sites was rare.
The TUR project expanded the scope of study documenting the continuum of occupation in Tucson from prehistoric time to the modern era.
Recently, additional historic archaeological research in the historic core area has been sponsored by the City of Tucson as part of its Tucson Origins project.
Most of the survey and excavation projects that have been conducted in the Tucson area have occurred since the 1970s and 1980s.
One of the larger surveys in the subarea was conducted by the Arizona State Museum as part of the Santa Cruz River Park study in 1975-1976.
This survey covered both sides of the Santa Cruz river from its confluence with the Rillito to north of the San Xavier District boundary and recorded valuable archaeological information on sites in heavily developed areas.
A National Register nomination form was filled out for the 13 mile long project area that includes 33 major archaeological sites, most of which are large Hohokam villages, such as the Valencia Site and the West Branch Site.
Excavation at the West Branch site in 1984 refined regional dates for the Pre-Classic time period and documented the organization of household subsistence practices in prehistory.
The other large archaeological survey in the subarea focused on the National Park lands within the Saguaro National Monument West Unit in the Rincon Mountains.
Survey work started in the mid 1960s and continued up until the 1990s resulting in the recording of hundreds of archaeological sites in the mountain foothills.
Tumamoc Hill and the adjacent bajadas were also surveyed in the 1970s by the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society.
This large volcanic prominence on the west side of the Santa Cruz River is the location of a prehistoric trincerhas site that is characterized by numerous rock walls or terraces along with hundreds of other kinds of rock features used for dry farming in prehistory.
Evidence suggests that the hill and the surrounding area was utilized for thousands of years.
Survey on the Flying V Ranch at Ventana Canyon in the mid 1980s, discovered further evidence of Archaic and Hohokam populations settling in the foothills of the Catalina Mountains.
While the Hohokam use of the subarea was well established years ago, the antiquity of human settlement in the Tucson area became clearer after the excavation of the Milagro site located on one of the older terraces along the Tanque Verde Wash.
This site, excavated in 1984, represents one of the oldest known agricultural settlements in the southwest.
The significance of the sites relates to its containing evidence for sedentary agricultural existence dating to 800 B.C. placing the origins of agriculture in the region centuries earlier than previously thought.
This corroborated other hints from the Cienega Creek area suggesting that the Hohokam Indians did not bring agriculture to the Tucson Basin, but rather, earlier Archaic populations were practicing this form of subsistence long before the Hohokam culture emerged.
Excavations conducted in the mid to late 1990s along the I-10 corridor have further supported this view by revealing a series of ancient villages located adjacent to the Santa Cruz flood plain from approximately Speedway Boulevard to Ruthrauf Road in Tucson.
Archaeological testing during the planning stages of frontage road construction along I-10 has detected most of these sites.
Last year, another site was found further to the north during testing in advance of construction at Pima County's wastewater treatment facility at Ina Road.
The results of testing and follow up excavation at the Santa Cruz Bend site, Square Hearth, Stone Pipe, Canal, Los Pozos and Las Capas sites have documented use of the Santa Cruz flood plain from the end of the Middle Archaic Period to the early centuries after Christ, a time span of approximately 4000 years.
These sites contain evidence of corn agriculture, canal irrigation, and sedentary village life, traits previously thought to have entered the Tucson area much later in prehistory.
With this new knowledge older theories on the transition from hunting and gathering to settled agricultural life in the Southwest will have to be revised and these new findings will also contribute to the long debate on the origin of the Hohokam people.
Survey data There are two kinds of surveys that archaeologists perform: Linear and block.
Linear survey involves inspecting a right-of-way for construction of a road, sewer line, telephone cable or other linear feature.
These surveys tend to be done in compliance with legal mandates requiring environmental studies during project planning.
Block survey involves examining non-linear properties ranging in size from a few acres to 1000s of acres.
These are typically done either in compliance with legal mandates, or through academic or preservation related research projects.
The Map entitled Archaeology Survey Locations shows the areas within the subarea that have been archaeologically surveyed and the sites that have been recorded.
It is evident that survey has been conducted primarily on private lands in the north and west half of the subarea.
Moreover, survey coverage has been achieved primarily through a great many small parcel and road right-of-way surveys that, with some notable exceptions, have focused along the Santa Cruz River, the Rillito River, and in the Catalina foothills.
This reflects the effect of laws requiring survey and excavation in advance of state highway projects and Pima County's cultural resources requirements for rezoning and grading for development.
The City of Tucson's historic preservation ordinance also requires archaeological investigations in some circumstances and these projects are also reflected.
Presented below is a breakdown of survey data by acreage and survey type including the percentage of the subarea that has been investigated.
Table IV.8.2.
Middle Santa Cruz Subarea - Survey Acreage by Survey Type Survey Type Number Acres Surveyed Percent of Subarea Linear 757 7521 2.0 Block 749 16,623 4.6 Total 1506 24,144 6.6
The survey total indicates that despite numerous surveys conducted within the subarea, only a small portion of the landscape has been intensively investigated, and that conversely the vast majority of the land within the subarea, over 93 percent, has not.
Despite this shortcoming, a large number of cultural resources, representing thousands of years of human occupation, are reported within the Middle Santa Cruz Valley subarea.
The most abundant cultural resource within the Middle Santa Cruz Valley subarea is not archaeological but architectural in nature.
The dense clusters of red triangles seen in the downtown Tucson area on the archaeology survey map are actually historic buildings that were assigned identifiers in the Arizona State Museum archaeological data base.
This represent a total of 3988 historic buildings and includes hundreds of residences and related structures located within Tucson's 16 Historic Districts (see National Register Properties below).
This is the only subarea in Pima County where historic resources have received anything equal to the research attention that archaeological sites have.
Site Data - Chronology Table IV.8.3 presents information on the number of prehistoric sites in the subarea by time period as reported by the Arizona State Museum.
These data represent the latest information on site counts per time period.

*Includes 31 sites that have both Archaic and Ceramic Period occupations
While no sites dating to the PaleoIndian Period have yet been reported in the subarea, a few sites have been found to the east along the San Pedro River Valley.
Several diagnostic spear points have also been found in the Tucson Mountains, within Saguaro National Monument East, and near Oracle Junction to the north, which at least demonstrate the presence of PaleoIndian People in the vicinity.
The term "PaleoIndian" describes the earliest period of human occupation in the Americas.
This was a time following the end of the last ice age when the environment was cooler and wetter than it is today.
Many species of now extinct animals including mammoth, horse, camel, bear, bison, and lions lived during this period.
Numerous archaeological sites found in the west indicate that hunting these large animals was an important part of the subsistence of PaleoIndian people, and as such, archaeologists refer to them as "big game hunters."
While very little is known about these people, it is believed that they lived in small groups or bands by hunting and gathering wild foods as they became seasonably available throughout the year.
Archaeological evidence suggest that they were highly mobile covering thousands of square miles in a year as they moved across the landscape.
Early in the succeeding Archaic Period, the environment became warmer, the large game animals disappeared, and modern plant and animal species were established.
The Archaic Period is minimally represented in the subarea with 34, none of which can be more accurately dated.
The Archaic Period represent a time span of almost 8000 years during which human beings adjusted their way of living in response to new environmental conditions.
In order to survive, people became generalists in their subsistence practices, hunting and gathering a wide variety of plants and animals and becoming more efficient in how they processed their food as indicated by the presence of grinding stones found on sites of this period.
Again, people appeared to have lived in small groups by hunting a gathering wild plants and animals over large areas through a seasonal round.
Sites from the early and middle parts of the Archaic are rare in southern Arizona suggesting low population levels in response to the unfavorable environmental conditions believed to exist at that time; however, toward the end of the period several significant changes occurred laying the foundation for subsequent cultural development.
First, the environment stabilized by 4500 years ago approaching modern conditions by that time.
Second, population levels appear to have increased and some evidence suggests that people roamed within more restricted territories as a result.
Third, by approximately 3500 years ago, people began to experiment with growing their own food as a supplement to their diet.
This change also co-occurred with more permanent settlement along well watered reaches of the major drainages in the region.
Research conducted within the last five years along the Santa Cruz River flood plain has confirmed the presence of settled village sites occupied by late Archaic people who practiced agriculture, utilized canal irrigation, and were experimenting with ceramic technology as early as 3000 years ago.
These developments push back the origins of settled agricultural existence in prehistory at least 1000 years from the previously established dates for the region.
A total of 305 sites dating to the Ceramic Period are known within the subarea indicating intensive use of the Middle Santa Cruz Valley during this time in prehistory.
The Ceramic Period covers the time between the adoption of ceramic technology in the third and fourth centuries after Christ to the end of the prehistoric sequence around A.D. 1540.
It was during the early part of the period, between approximately A.D. 200 to A.D. 700, that Archaic Period populations completed the transition from mobile hunting and gathering to settled, village based, agricultural existence in southern Arizona and elsewhere.
The principal pottery bearing people in the region during prehistory were the Hohokam, who emerged as a distinct culture in the eighth century and dominated central and southern Arizona until around A.D. 1450.
The Hohokam flourished along the river valleys of southern Arizona, including the Santa Cruz Valley, but were also well adapted to the desert lands to the west.
They lived in settled, permanent villages, grew their own food using irrigation and dry farming techniques, developed a rich ceremonial life, and traded extensively with their neighbors throughout the region.
A period of environmental instability during the A.D. 1300s is believed by some to have weakened the agricultural economy to the point where the Hohokam were no longer able to produce food in sufficient quantifies and with enough consistency to support large populations.
Other theories suggest that warfare or disease may have destabilized the social system leading to decline.
Whatever the cause, the Hohokam culture collapsed around A.D. 1450.
Following the collapse of the Hohokam, the region is believed to have been occupied in very low numbers by an O'odham (upper Piman speaking) people whose settlement and subsistence practices reflect a return to an earlier, simpler way of living.
Life continued to involve the cultivation of crops supplemented by hunting a gathering, but the level of technical sophistication and social and religious cohesion characteristic of the Hohokam is missing in these later populations.
These people are believed to be the descendants of the Hohokam, but are recognized as separate culture groups.
Archaeologists know very little about the period that represents the end of the Hohokam and the beginning of the Spanish Colonial presence in southern Arizona.
It appears to have been a time of flux when the vacuum left by the disappearance of the Hohokam was filled by groups that the Spanish recognized as the Sobaipuri and the Tohono O'odham in the 17th and 18th centuries.
When the first Europeans arrived in the Tucson area, they found seasonally occupied settlements, called rancherias, at the base of Sentinel Peak and at San Xavier a few miles to the south.
Other settlements were present along the San Pedro and Gila Rivers and west of Tucson on what is now the Tohono O'odham reservation.

Table IV.8.4 presents archaeological data on the Historic Period, spanning the years between A.D. 1540 and 1950.
The history of the Middle Santa Cruz Subarea can be viewed in terms of the settlement of the Santa Cruz River Valley.
In 1691, Father Eusebio Kino, a Jesuit priest, began a series of trips into the Pimeria Alta to meet with the native population.
This resulted in the construction of the mission church at the village of San Xavier del Bac starting in 1700 south of Tucson and the founding of a large church at Guevavi in the Upper Santa Cruz Valley, north of modern day Nogales.
The introduction of Christianity changed the native ways of life profoundly.
Livestock, wheat, and other domesticated plants and animals were added to the economy.
Diseases introduced by the Europeans wiped out entire Indian villages and the native settlements of Sonora and Arizona were reorganized with a new focus on mission communities.
Presidios, or forts, established by the Spanish at strategic places, originally for protection from the Apaches, were also occasionally used to keep the usually friendly Pimans in check.
This was of particular concern to the Spanish in the years between 1734 and 1760 when Piman populations were agitating against Colonial rule culminating in the Pima Revolt of 1751.
Following these events, Spanish security concerns focused on the Apaches, who threatened Spanish outposts all along the northern frontier.
The need for defense prompted the Spanish to establish a presidio at Tubac in 1752, which was later removed to the location of Tucson in 1775.
On August 20th of that year, Don Hugo O'Connor founded the Presidio of San AgustÃ¯Â¿Â½n del TuquisÃ¯Â¿Â½n on the east side of the Santa Cruz River in the approximate location of what is today El Presidio Park Plaza.
Only a few months later in October, 1775, Captain Juan Bautista de Anza set off from Tubac in October, passed down the Santa Cruz River Valley through the settlement at Tucson turning west along the Gila River and journeyed on to the Pacific Coast culminating in the founding of San Francisco.
During these early years, the existence of Tucson as a viable settlement hung in the balance.
Despite the presence of Spanish military personnel, the Apaches pretty much helped themselves to the livestock and colonists lost their lives in the hinter lands.
The most serious event in Tucson's young history came in 1782 in the form of a full scale Apache assault in which 600 warriors attacked the Presidio very nearly ending Spain's colonial experiment in the Pimeria Alta.
The pace of construction on the wall surrounding the settlement picked up shortly thereafter.
Despite the hostility of the locals, Tucson survived and in 1800 the church constructed the mission of San Augistin, referred thereafter as the Convento, on the west side of the Santa Cruz River in the shadow of Sentinel Peak.
By 1804, a total of 1015 souls called Tucson home.
In the later years of the Spanish Colonial period, ranching, mining, and agriculture were the principal economic activities in the Santa Cruz Valley and elsewhere.
This was a time of relative peace until the Mexican War of Independence ended the colonial period in 1821.
The missionization and military protection programs of the Spanish colonial government encouraged an influx of Spanish colonists early in the 18th century that eventually brought and end to the dispersed pattern of Indian Villages along the length of the Santa Cruz River.
The Santa Cruz Valley became dominated by the inhabitants of Spanish and Mexican decent who survived mainly by farming, ranching, and trade.
Apaches began raiding extensively in southern Arizona after 1830 and were a major threat to the Mexican Settlements.
The Mexican war of 1846 and subsequent transfer of the Gadsden purchase to U.S. ownership in 1854 were the primary historical events leading to the end of Spanish and Mexican domination of the Santa Cruz Valley.
By the time of the Gadsden purchase, Spanish and later Mexican settlements were well established, and ranching and mining had replaced much of the traditional agricultural subsistence base.
In Tucson, not much had changed since the turn of the 19th century, however.
Population within the settlement declined to a low of about 460 people in the 1830s that picked up somewhat with the influx of miners who passed though the settlement in the late 1840s on their way to the gold fields of California.
What the Americans saw in 1856 when U.S. troops took control of the presidio from the Mexican Army was a small village of about one thousand people living inside and close to the fort.
The residents grew crops in the bottom lands nearby, raised cattle and sheep, and watched for attack from the Apache Indians.
Shortly thereafter things began to change.
The Butterfield Overland Mail Company route passed through the subarea during its short operations between 1858 and 1861.
This was one of the first long distance mail carriers to be established linking the southwestern territories with the rest of the United States.
Contracted by the federal government, the company offered mail service between Saint Louis, Missouri and San Francisco, California along a route that included stations spaced every 20 miles on average.
The stations were to provide food, grain, water, ammunition, and equipment for mending coaches and shoeing mules and horses.
One of these stations was located in Tucson itself near what is now Pearl and Pennington Streets.
The outbreak of the civil war lead to the abandonment of the Butterfield line.
During the war, Tucson was briefly occupied by the Confederacy in 1862, only to be reclaimed by Union Troops a short time later.
Skirmishes between Union and confederate forces near Pichacho Pass were some of the western most engagements of the civil war.
Arizona officially became a territory in 1863.
National politics, and the presence of proven mineral wealth, convinced President Abraham Lincoln to recognize Arizona as a territory separate from that of New Mexico and Prescott was selected as the first territorial capital.
Tucson should have been chosen being the most important settlement in the territory, but at the time it was believed that Tucson had too many southern sympathizers.
After the war, ranching and mining dominated the territorial economy and brought in Anglo-Americans in search of gold, silver, copper and other minerals.
However, lumbering and farming also contributed as economic opportunities expanded.
Continued confrontation with the Apaches prompted the establishment of a permanent US military presence throughout southern Arizona, and a number of posts, camps, and forts sprung from Tubac to Holbrook including Fort Lowell, established 10 miles north and west of Tucson in 1873.
The war with the Apaches ended in 1886 with the surrender of Geronimo ushering a period of peace and prosperity.
With the coming of the railroad in 1880, Tucson became connected to the rest of the nation, bringing greater population growth and a more commercially oriented economy.
Meanwhile, Tucson began to see the results of progress.
Amenities came in rapid succession with Telegraph lines being installed in 1873, followed by a telephone system in 1881, and then gas, electricity, and city water in 1882.
One of the least appreciated events at the time, but perhaps one of the most important for the future of Tucson, occurred in 1885 when the Territorial legislature in Prescot awarded Tucson the authority to build the University of Arizona.
This came about through some late night horse trading whereby it was decided that Prescott would remain the territorial capital, Yuma would get the prison, Phoenix would get the mental hospital, and Tucson would get the U, which unfortunately did not have an appropriation that went with it.
The citizens of Tucson were outraged and the man responsible for this disaster was forced to hire a body guard.
In any event, ground breaking the university was held on October 27, 1887 and the University officially opened on October 1, 1891.
Statehood came to Arizona in 1912 after many fruitless years of trying to convince the Congress of the Territory's worthiness.
Statehood also resulted in the establishment of the state trust lands that still to this day cover vast territory throughout southern Arizona, including Pima County.
The establishment of the US Forrest Service (1905) prior to statehood and the Bureau of Land Management afterwards (1946) had a tremendous impact on rural life in the region including the Santa Cruz Valley adding forest and range management requirements to lands that traditionally had none.
Tucson by the time of statehood had grown beyond the confines of the historic downtown core, which for many years was characterized by a north south axis along the Santa Cruz River and growth shifted east.
Twenty-three thousand people lived in Tucson at the time, which would remain the largest city in the state until the 1920s when Phoenix surpassed it thereafter.
The effects of the first and second World Wars cannot be overstated in that each of these national convulsions brought an influx of people and technology to southern Arizona making Tucson the main population center in the region.
Copper mining became a major economic force in the area including the east flanks of the Sierrita Mountains, but farming and ranching continued to be important in the Santa Cruz Valley and elsewhere.
The Davis-Monthan airfield opened in 1927 adding air travel to train transport, and automobile travel, still in its infancy.
As a center of health care, Tucson attracted thousands of people from all over the country to its sunny and arid climate beginning in the 1890s and continuing well into the 1920s.
Tourism too began to draw people into the area and the hospitality industry responded.
It was during this time, for instance, that the El Conquistador Hotel (1925) and the Arizona Inn (1931) were built and dude ranches became popular as source of rural relaxation.
The Depression brought hard times to Tucson, still a small town by national standards.
The boom that came with World War II, however, changed the city's fortunes and thousands of serviceman were stationed at the air base.
Following the war, many of these same servicemen settled in Tucson to raise families and rapid population growth ensued.
In 1940, there were approximately 35,000 people within the city limits.
By 1960, this number jumped to a little more than 212,000 people a six fold increase in twenty years.
By 1980 330,000 people lived in Tucson and today the population rate is almost 483,000 with almost another 400,000 living in Pima County.
As a result of this demographic trend, urbanization has filled the Middle Santa Cruz subarea in all areas with the exception of federal lands (Saguaro National Monument, Coronado National Forest), County lands (Tucson Mountain Park), and some state lands in the southeastern corner of the subarea near Pantano Wash.
Regionally, growth has begun to expand out from Tucson up the Upper Santa Cruz Valley and into the adjoining basins as new communities have become established in what was once open range along the valley floors.
Today, Tucson's tremendous success threatens the record of its past as never before.
A total of 93 Historic Period sites have been identified in the subarea by the Arizona State Museum, 53 of which are Euro-American, 18 are Mexican in ethnic origin.
There are twelve sites attributed to the Tohono O'odham, two have been identified as Spanish and the cultural identity of eight sites is unknown.
Low sample size, the greater visibility of some sites and not others, and a lack of research interest in the archaeology of the historic time period distorts the true picture of historic period land use in the subarea.
Given the long history of the Tucson area, it is certain that archaeological remains associated with the trends discussed above exist within the subarea with varying degrees of integrity.
Site Data - Function The site data from both the historic and prehistoric eras can also be examined from a functional perspective to highlight land use trends within the subarea.
The following is a summary of archaeological site data for the subarea that is presented by gross time period and site function.
These data are made available by the Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona.

The site counts presented in Table IV.8.5 show that prehistoric sites out number the historic by less than five to one and that in 60 instances, occupations from both major time periods are present on the same site.
The prehistoric site counts are dominated by Resource Processing (food and non food resources) and Habitation (residential) uses, which is typical of the functional data from other subareas.
Food, shelter and non-food resources are critical for life everywhere.
Agriculture (i.e. fields, water control features) is next with 10 sites followed by Art, meaning rock art, and Religion, both of which are represented by eight sites each.
Resource Procurement (food and non food resources), Disposal (trash) and Storage appear in small numbers and may reflect more of a bias in recording than in actual presence in the archaeological record.
As is the case in the other subareas in Pima County, the largest number of prehistoric sites cannot be functionally identified based on survey data.
The historic sites emphasize residential needs over all others, with Habitation being the primary functional category represented with 29 sites.
What follows next are sites classified with a governmental or civic function with 22 sites.
This is the highest number of sites with this particular use identified anywhere in Pima County and is consistent with the role of Tucson as a center of power during the historic period.
Sites classifiable as Disposal, or trash dumps, are next with 15, followed by five sites identified as being agricultural in nature.
Resource Processing and Religion are represented with two sites each, and sites with Storage and Transportation functions are barely represented with one site each.
The low number of sites associated with resource processing stands in contrast to the high number of such sites that are prehistoric in age.
This may be a function of the differences in economic organization between the historic and prehistoric occupations.
Resource processing during prehistoric times almost always involves features used for cooking food, whereas during the historic era, sites used for resource processing are often associated with mining or other industrial activities.
Again, sample bias in the collection of data from the historic period distorts the evidence, but nonetheless, part of the explanation may lie in the very different ways in which prehistoric and historic people made their living.
This is the same pattern observed in the data from the Tortolita Fan Subarea.
Fifteen of the sixty sites with both prehistoric and historic occupations on them can be functionally identified as having uses associated with Habitation, followed in order by Disposal and Resource Processing with four sites each.
Agriculture and Transportation are present with two sites each, and Art, Resource Procurement, and Religion are last with one site each.
There are also 130 sites where function can be determined but age cannot, with Resource Processing (15), Habitation (5), Agriculture (5) and Government (3) being the first, second, and third site types listed by order of rank.
Minor site counts exist for Disposal, Religion, Storage and Transportation.
It is likely that many of the Resource Processing and Habitation sites are Native American, possibly O'odham, but lack diagnostic artifacts to confirm their identity.
Euro-American sites are usually pretty straightforward because of the distinctive characteristics of the material culture including glass, metal, pottery, etc.
Of all sites from both the prehistoric and historic time period, the data presented in Table 5 indicates that site use within the subarea is equally split between Habitation and Resource Processing of food and non-food items with 104 sites each, the latter being dominated by prehistoric sites with these functional uses.
Government functions are second in overall count at 28, being dominated by historic period sites and this is followed in third by sites identified as having disposal as the primary function represented by 24 sites; these too are largely historic in origin.
Agricultural is fourth in rank with 22 sites, Religion is fifth with 13, most of which are prehistoric in origin, and Art is sixth.
This use category is also dominated by sites in the prehistoric column.
Resource procurement is minimally represented with five sites and Storage and Transportation are tied for last in order with four site each.
Not surprisingly, the vast majority of those sites that could be functionally identified relate to housing and processing food and non food resources.
Again, it is interesting to see the contrast between the historic and prehistoric representation of Government as a site function, being present only in the historic era, whereas the situation is reversed for sites classified as Resource Processing.
As noted, these patterns are surely affected by the bias inherent in the data, but can nonetheless be argued to reflect differences in how prehistoric and historic populations have used the subarea over time.
To sum the information on archaeological sites, the Middle Santa Cruz subarea has witnessed a combination of archaeological survey and site excavation that has informed upon the past and is breaking new ground, so to speak.
Still only a very small fraction of the subarea has been ever investigated.
Because of this, site distribution is largely a reflection of where investigation has occurred than past land use patterning.
Even so, it is possible to make a few summary statements based on the archaeological record:
1) It is evident that human beings have occupied the Middle Santa Cruz Valley subarea for many thousands of years and recent study of the Santa Cruz River flood plain suggests that the origins of sedentary village life, agriculture, and irrigation technology occurred far earlier than previously reported.
The subarea has experienced two peaks in occupation, the first occurring in prehistory during the period between A.D. 200 and A.D. 1300, and the second occurring after 1775.
3) Certain parts of the landscape have been more heavily utilized than others especially along the margins of the Santa Cruz River, the Rillito River and its tributaries where surface water has been available.
4) The predominant use of the landscape relates to housing and processing both food and non food resources for the two major time periods; however, significant differences in social and economic organization between the prehistoric and historic populations that can be inferred from the data.
B. Historical Resources "Historical resources are sites, districts, structures, objects, or other evidences of human activities that represent facets of the history of the nation, state, or locality.
Also places where significant historical or unusual events occurred even though no evidence of the event remains, or places associated with persons significant in our history that have gained importance in the last 50 years" (Preserving Cultural and Historic Resources, Pima County, May 1999).
Historical resources are largely constructed or engineered elements of the built environment including buildings used for residential purposes, such as houses, but also commercial stores, industrial facilities, civic centers, and places of worship.
Roads, bridges, irrigation canals, mining works, and railroad tracks are also historical resources.
Information on these places is recovered through drawings and design plans, photographs, maps, surveys, and personal recollections.
The Middle Santa Cruz subarea has a large number of places of historic importance including the City of Tucson, itself a historic community; places that have been recognized for their historic value and registered on the National Register of Historic Places; and, two historic trails.
Historic Communities: Historic Communities are those settlements that were established 50 or more years ago as indicated by either a founding date or the date the post office first opened.
The following description is derived from "Tucson" by C. L. Sonnichsen, University of Oklahoma Press, 1982
Tucson: The name of the modern city of Tucson is derived from the Piman word "Stjukson" meaning "at the foot of the black hill or mountain," which was given to the Indian settlement at the base of Sentinel Peak (A Mountain).
Father Eusebio Kino first visited the subarea in 1691 and in 1700 built the first of several mission churches at the village of Bac located several miles south and west of the present downtown.
In 1775 Don Hugo O'Connor, acting under the authority of the King of Spain founded the Presidio of San AgustÃ¯Â¿Â½n del TuquisÃ¯Â¿Â½n, a fortified village, in roughly the same location as the present day El Presidio Park Plaza.
This settlement became the nucleus of European colonial occupation on the northern frontier that has survived to the present day from Spanish Colonial times, through the Mexican and U.S. Territorial eras, through statehood and finally the post World War II population boom, which laid the foundation for the modern metropolis that characterizes the city today.
National Register Properties: The National Register of Historic Places was created as a part of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.
It is the nation's premier honor roll for places deemed of national, regional, or local historic importance.
The criteria for listing include: a) association with a person who has contributed to history; b) association with an event important to history; c) associated with the work of a master artist or craftsman or typical of a style or type of workmanship; d) yielding or having the potential to yield information important to history or prehistory.
Listing in no way effects the rights of private property owners to do what they wish with their property.
Federal agencies; however, are required to consider the effects of their actions on listed properties.
There are one hundred National Register Properties in the Middle Santa Cruz subarea, including 16 Historic Districts as shown on the map entitled, "National Register Historic Districts."
In all, 3988 historic buildings and structures have been recorded in the Tucson area, almost all of which are included within these districts.
The districts are listed below along with the period of significance for which each was nominated to the National Register.
Table IV.8.6.
Middle Santa Cruz Subarea - National Register Districts
District Address Period Armory Park E. 12th St. to 19th St., Stone Ave. to 2nd Ave. 1880-early 1900s Barrio Libre Roughly bounded by 14th, 19th, Stone and Osborne Sts. 1863-1900 Colonia Solana Roughly bounded by Broadway Blvd., S. Randolph Way, Camino Campestre, and S. Country Club 1920s-1930s El Encanto Estates Roughly bounded by Country Club Rd., Broadway Blvd., Fifth St., 
Note: The City of Tucson has designated several local districts pursuant to its own preservation laws many of which are also on the National Register of Historic Places.
For example, Barrio Historico, is a city designated district subject to city preservation requirements that is physically within the limits of the Barrio Libre National Register District.
Other districts listed by the City through its own preservation ordinance that are also listed on the National Register include Armory Park, Fort Lowell, El Presidio and West University.
The San Xavier Environs is a City listed district that is not on the National Register.
For a complete listing of all National Register districts and individually listed properties see Appendix A.
Historic Trails: In many places, historic and prehistoric trails often become the basis for roads and modern highways and the Middle Santa Cruz subarea is no exception.
The references used are cited elsewhere in this document.
Anza Trail.
This is the route taken by Juan Bautista de Anza in the expedition of 1775-1776 when he lead a group of some 250 colonists and 1200 head of livestock from Sonora to found a presidio and mission for Spain at San Francisco Bay.
The trail extends from Nogales, Arizona to San Francisco, California, a distance of 1200 miles.
There are approximately 60 miles of trail in Pima County along the west bank of the Sant Cruz River, with six campsites at Canoa, Llano Grande (south of Sahuarita), San Xavier del Bac, Tucquison (north of downtown Tucson).
Llano del Azotado (at the north end of the Tucson Mountains), and Oitipars (near the Pinal County Line).
The Anza Trail has been nominated as a National Historic Trail by the National Park Service.
Today, Interstate 19 and portions of Interstate 10 follow the original route down the Santa Cruz Valley.
In the Subarea, the Anza Trail followed the west side of the Santa Cruz River.
Butterfield Stage Line.
The Butterfield Overland Company was one of the first continental mail carriers.
It opened in 1858 connecting St. Louis, Missouri and San Francisco, California; however, by 1861 it had ceased operations.
In Arizona, the company used parts of existing trails to forge a route some 437 miles in length.
In 1869, Wells Fargo operated over the old Butterfield stage lines and in the 1870s, the Southern Pacific railroad surveyed along the approximate route.
In the Middle Santa Cruz Subarea, the trail is believed to have entered into Tucson from the east following a trail that later was closely paralleled by the Southern Pacific Railroad crossing what is today the Davis-Monthan Air Base and then up Main Street to a stage station near what is now Pearl and Pennington Streets.
Leaving Tucson, the route headed north on the east side of the river, crossing west at Jaynes Station and following what is today Silverbell road passed two stops, Nine Mile Water Hole and Pointer Mountain, before crossing to the east again at the northern end of the Tucson Mountains.
To sum the discussion of historic resources, the subarea contains a variety of places that are symbolic of different historic forces that have affected southern Arizona and the nation as a whole from the founding of Tucson as a fortified village in the 18th century, to the Butterfield Overland Mail Route and the coming of the railroad, to the founding of the University of Arizona in 1885, to the establishment of Tucson as an important military base for both World Wars, and finally, the growth of Tucson as a regional urban center in recent years.
C.
Traditional Cultural Places "A traditional cultural place is a historic site or district that is important because of its association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community that (a) are rooted in that community's history, and (b) are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community.
The traditional cultural significance of an historic property is derived from the role the property plays in a community's historically rooted beliefs, customs, and practices" (Preserving Cultural and Historic Resources, Pima County, May 1991).
Pima County has been occupied by indigenous peoples for thousands of years and the modern descendants of these prehistoric cultures still live in the region today.
All of Pima County is claimed as ancestral lands by the Ak-Chin Indian Community, the Gila River Indian Community, and the Tohono O'odham Nation.
The Piman speaking groups (including the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community) claim direct ancestral affiliation with the prehistoric Hohokam Indians who inhabited much of southern and central Arizona.
Other Indian groups also claim ancestral ties to the Pima County area including the Zuni of central western New Mexico and the Hopi of northeastern Arizona based on oral histories and myth that identify southern Arizona as a place of origin for these tribes.
The Apaches also lived in the region for hundreds of years and therefore they too can claim an ancestral connection to the land and the places of traditional value to them that it may contain.
Other groups with potential claims to places of traditional cultural value include the Hispanic and Anglo communities.
Places of traditional cultural value, as defined, are special to the community and must often remain secret to non-members; this is particularly true among Native Americans.
These might be places where in the past natural resources were collected for ceremony or where natural features on the landscape are still recognized as having significance.
Other places with traditional cultural value of particular importance to Native Americans are rock art sites and all archaeological sites containing human graves.
Eight sites within the subarea are identified as prehistoric rock art localities, and in addition, fifty-three prehistoric sites were used for habitation; these sites often contain human graves.
It is reasonable to assume, that Native Americans would identify these places as having traditional cultural value.
More than likely, there are many places with these kinds of values that exist in the Middle Santa Cruz subarea.
The only well known traditional cultural place in the subarea is not Native American but Mexican-American in origin.
The following description is derived from the National Register form available at the State Historic Preservation Office in Phoenix, Arizona.
El Tiradito.
Otherwise known as the wishing shrine, this place is identified as the only shrine in the United State dedicated to the soul of a sinner in unconsecrated ground.
Its name means "the castaway" and the many legends about its origin all involve a tragic love affair in the early 1870s.
It is used as a place of petition where miracles can be granted.
The site was placed on the National Register in 1971.

THREAT ASSESSMENT: The next map, entitled "Archaeological Sites and Land Ownership" shows the distribution of sites in relation to land status.
The data presented in this figure represent current information provide by the Arizona State Museum.
Again, the moss of sits shown in the downtown area are actually historic buildings.
Aside from these, however, it is apparent that most of the 737 archaeological sites plotted are located on private lands along the Santa Cruz and Rillito Rivers and in the Catalina Mountain Foothills.
A large number of sites are shown within the Saguaro National Monument Western District with a scattering of sites in the Coronado National Forest.
Sites have also been recorded on state lands in the southeast corner of the subarea.
The overall distribution shown on this map is a product of both where sites are located and where efforts have been made to find them.
Legal protections against unauthorized disturbances are afforded archaeological sites and other cultural and historical resources on state and federal lands, but only one law, the Arizona State Burial Protection Act, applies to private land.
Cultural resources on county lands are also covered by legal protections defined under county law and policy.
Data are presented in Table 7 below showing the number of archaeological sites by land status and degree of legal protection for cultural resources.
Table IV.8.7.
Middle Santa Cruz Subarea Archaeological Sites by Landownership and Legal Protection Jurisdiction No. of Archaeological Sites Protection Status/Level Military Reservations 8 Protected/high National Forest Lands 69 Protected/high National Parks/Monuments 205 Protected/high State Lands (Trust) 69 Protected/moderate Private Lands 386 Unprotected/low Total 737
A total of 282 of the 737 sites or 38% have high protection status, reflecting the relatively high percentage of federal lands in the subarea (37.8%).
Sixty-nine sites are on state lands and thus are moderately protected from public and private actions.
The remaining 386 sites, or 52.3%, have low protection status since they are located on private property.
Since state trust lands can be sold for development, and private lands are subject only to local zoning, 455 or 61.7% of the 737 known archaeological sites may be (or have already been) affected by future development in the subarea.
The majority of the land base in the subarea has never been archaeologically surveyed and most of the subarea has been heavily developed through urban expansion meaning that hundreds, even thousands of sites may potentially exist.
Site density estimates for the subarea calculated by dividing the total survey area (37.7 square miles) by the number of known sites (737) produces a figure of 19.5 sites per mile.
This is by far the highest site density estimate of all the subareas in Pima County and is influenced by three factors: 1) Prehistorically, the Middle Santa Cruz was one of the most densely occupied areas in all of Pima County for centuries; 2) Tucson has been the primary population center for Euro-Americans and other ethnic groups for more than 200 years and archaeological sites from the historic period contribute a high proportion to the overall site count, and; 3) most of the areas surveyed have been in close proximity to a water source and this inflates the site counts distorting any density estimates for the area as a whole.
The site density figures when applied to the whole of the subarea produces a figure of over 10,000 archaeological sites, which because of the bias in how the subarea has been surveyed is not useful.
Nonetheless, given the intensify of occupation that is known to have occurred within the subarea during both the prehistoric and historic periods, it is reasonable to assume that many thousands of archaeological sites exist in the subarea.
Moreover, 3988 historic buildings have been recorded making historic resources a significant part of the cultural resource base in the subarea.
Resource Loss: There is only one sources of cultural resource loss in the subarea: urbanization.
The map entitled, GAP Vegetation shows the extent of the urban area that has replaced the native vegetation.
Also shown are the locations of the known archaeological sites, and the 3988 historic buildings located near the historic core of Tucson.
Comparing this map against the map entitled, Modern Communities Transportation and Ownership demonstrates that virtually every piece of private property within the subarea has been developed to one degree or another, with some exceptions on the east and southeast edges.
The only other places that remain relatively intact within the urban area are City and County parks.
Given the destructive effect of development on cultural resources, particularly archaeological sites, and given the extent of urbanization within the subarea, it is reasonable to assume that the integrity of much of the archaeological record has been compromised to varying degrees.
This does not mean that there is no point in looking for archaeological sites within the urban area.
Archaeological research in cities around the world have demonstrated that important cultural deposits survive to the modern era, particularly younger deposits; however, preservation is often a matter of luck more than anything else where important cultural deposits happen to be buried under streets or saved in vacant lots.
Historic archaeology can be a powerful tool for learning about the history of urban areas, but because of the degree of disturbance must often be conducted in conjunction with historic maps; census, probate and tax records; historic photographs and the like, to make sense of what is found.
Historic Buildings too are affected by urbanization through the regular process of alteration, addition, and in some cases demolition.
The El Conquistador Hotel, one of Tucson's finest in the 1920s and 1930s is a good example of how a community can lose a treasured historic resource to the wrecking ball.
In other cases, the process is slow and occurs by many individual acts.
The loss of the Presidio wall surrounding the 18th and early 19th century settlement of Tucson happened this way as people tore down a section of the wall here or borrowed some of the adobe bricks there.
The largest single event resulting in the lose of the historic fabric of the city occurred as a result of improvements to the downtown area sponsored by the federal government through the urban renewal program.
Development of El Presidio Park Plaza destroyed whole neighborhoods.
Thus, over the years, many historic resources within the subarea have been lost as a result of the cumulative effect of many individual actions as well as government construction and redevelopment programs.
Resource Threat: The greatest threat to cultural resources of all kinds is continued urbanization at the outer edges of the urban form, as well as within the city on vacant land.
Approximately 40% of the city area is vacant and as population continues to grow, these lands will become more attractive for development especially so if through the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan, growth is slowed and redirected in the county.
Archaeological sites will continue to be threatened by development within the urban core from both public works projects and private development.
Since it can be assumed that much of the archaeological record has already been affected, saving what has survived becomes even more imperative.
While the City of Tucson has a preservation ordinance in place, its application to situations where archaeological sites may be damaged by development is limited.
Historic resources will also continue to be threatened.
While there are 16 National Register Districts and many more individually listed properties, these places are only the ones that have received attention and many more are deserving of that attention.
The truth is that placing a property on the National Register does not prevent its destruction, it only excludes the owner from tax benefits that come from maintaining the historic character of the property.
More stringent protections are afforded through local preservation law, but in reality more places are lost than are ever saved.
Thus, continued urbanization within the subarea, both at the edges of the current urban form and within the urbanized area will continue to pose a threat to cultural resources in the future.
Sensitivity Zone: Archaeological survey coverage within the subarea is very low at 6.1% and as a result the distribution of archaeological sites in particular, is not clearly understood.
In an effort to predict areas with high sensitivity for cultural and historical resources, proximity to water is used as an objective predictor; this assumes that in the desert places closer to water will tend to have been used more heavily by past human populations than places more removed from water sources.
The map entitled Cultural Resources High Sensitivity Areas identifies zones within the subarea that are predicted to be highly sensitive for cultural resources.
The model encompasses the Santa Cruz River corridor, the Rillito River, the Tanque Verde Creek and Pantano Wash, as well a series of springs in the Catalina Mountains and Rincon Mountains.
Different buffers widths are used for the sensitivity model.
The Rivers are buffered by two miles on either side for a total of four miles in width.
The springs receive a one mile buffer around them as does the area of shallow ground water shown in green.
The distribution of known archaeological sites is also provided in this figure and demonstrates that many, but not all known sites are captured within the sensitivity zones.
The buffers used are arbitrary and the statistical efficacy of the model is untested, even so this projection provides and idea of where common sense would predict sites to be located.
The buffered areas capture the distribution of known sites along the major drainages as predicted.
It also picks up a lot of the sites along the foothills of the Rincon Mountains and the Catalina Mountains near springs and in proximity to shallow ground water.
The historic core of Tucson is included because of its proximity to the Santa Cruz.
Obviously, proximity to surface water is not the only factor that conditioned human behavior in the past.
Nonetheless, the model does appear to work with sufficient capacity as a good guess where cultural resources, particularly those associated with habitation, can be expected to be found.
It is also remarkably consistent with where the expert opinion of local archaeologists predict that the remains of past land use should be found.
The model has the advantage of also allowing for an estimate of how much of the archaeological record may have been impacted by the scale of development that has occurred within the city limits over the years.
As mentioned, a site density estimate of approximately 19 sites per square mile is derived from survey data; however the data largely reflect investigations in proximity to areas with water.
The sensitivity model just presented captures 190,379 acres from drainages, springs and shallow ground water totaling 297.4 square miles.
At 19 sites per mile, this area could potentially contain as many 5651 archaeological sites.
Site estimate along the Santa Cruz River south of Green Valley and along the Cienega Creek average around 9 or 10 sites.
With the added effect of the historic archaeological record the number of sites in the Tucson area can be expected to be greater, but may not be as high as 19 sites per square mile in all areas close to water.
Thus, if a range of site density between 10 and 19 sites per square mile is used, a range of potential sites within the subarea can be estimated.
Taking this approach something on the order of between 3000 and 5600 archaeological sites from all time periods is derived.
This assumes that virtually no sites will be found in those areas outside of the buffered zones.
While no area will be completely devoid of archaeological sites, low numbers are generally found within the subarea when located at distance from water.
Therefore, while a number ranging from 3000 to 5600 sites is higher than the site estimates for other subareas examined in Pima County, given the importance of the middle Santa Cruz area as a focus of human habitation, this figure seems reasonable.
Given the extent of development, however, it can also be assumed that many of these sites have been damaged or destroyed.
IV.
SUMMARY: The cultural resources of the Middle Santa Cruz Subarea are the product of thousands of years of human settlement from the earliest prehistoric times to the modern day.
In that sense, they represent a collective history of this portion of eastern Pima County and can inform and educate future generations about the past.
But cultural resources are non renewable: there are only so many archaeological sites, historic buildings or places with traditional cultural value, and once they are gone there are no replacements.
It is for this reason that Pima County has included cultural resources in its planning for the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan.
This report provides information on known cultural resources within the subarea describing their nature and distribution and attempts to predict where other cultural resources may be found.
In this case, more may be actually known about historic resources that about the archaeological record reflecting a very high degree of effort on the part of the citizens of Tucson to recognize and protect their historic neighborhoods and landmarks.
Like many of the subareas that have been studied as part of the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan, the Middle Santa Cruz subarea has received a relatively low level of archaeological research attention over the years.
Despite a few notable exceptions, most research attention in the past was directed away from the city into the unspoiled hinterland where sites were still visible and accessible.
That has changed as the dictates of modern cultural resources management require examination of areas that would not have been investigated in the past, including much of the city area and those portions of the county that are currently undergoing rapid development.
From the body of research as a whole, however, it is evident that people have lived in the subarea for thousands of years.
However, unlike other subareas there were two periods of peak population: one during late prehistory between A.D. 700 and A.D. 1450 when the subarea was occupied by the Hohokam Indians, and the second beginning in the 18th century with the founding of Tucson by the Spanish.
Both the indigenous peoples and the European newcomers clearly thrived in the desert along the Santa Cruz River and learned to overcome the harshness of the environment to make a living and the vestiges of their settlements still exit within the subarea.
The construction of the mission of Saint Augustine, the building of the Presidio on the east side of the Santa Cruz River, and the passage of the Spanish along the Anza Trail in the 18th century all represents an era of exploration and conquest that forever changed the history of the land.
Later, the Butterfield stage line would retrace portions of the former trail through the subarea as mail was carried from Saint Louis to San Francisco.
The coming of the railroad in 1880 linked Tucson to the world and allowed it to prosper in a harsh land.
New neighborhoods were added to the old as Tucson pushed east from the banks of the river beginning in the late 19th century.
Many of these residences are now included within the 16 Historic Districts and 84 individual properties that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places for Tucson.
The site of El Tiradito represents a traditional cultural place that is special to the city's large Mexican-American community.
Lastly, Native American claims identify the subarea as part of their traditional use areas and the possibility that places with traditional cultural value exist in the subarea is high, especially those associated with the surrounding mountains.
In short, the subarea has a rich record of cultural and historical resources with high scientific, educational, and recreational values.
Yet the Middle Santa Cruz subarea, containing the City of Tucson and portions of its metropolitan suburbs, is undergoing accelerated change driven by population growth and the resulting development pressures.
These changes threaten what is left of the cultural resources in the urban area.
Ironically, these are the very resources that can tell us about the historical forces that created the city that is now consuming them.
Clearly, there is a need to identify cultural and historical resources, evaluate their significance, and where warranted protect the record of the past for the future.
