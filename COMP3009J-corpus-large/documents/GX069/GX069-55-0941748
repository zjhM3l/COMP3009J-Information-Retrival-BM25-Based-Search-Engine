Mammal Checklist
The mammals of the Big Bend region are extremely diverse.
Seventy-five species of mammals, representing 23 families, have been recorded in Big Bend National Park and the Rio Grande Wild and Scenic River.
Another six species are listed as hypothetical in the park.
Most Big Bend mammals are nocturnal.
Those that are active during daylight hours can usually be seen in the early morning and just before sunset.
Three excellent areas to look for large species like deer, javelina, mountain lion, fox, and coyote are the Chisos Basin, the area around Panther Junction, and Rio Grande Village.
Information on the abundance of each species comes from wildlife sighting reports by park staff and visitors, and park research reports.
Species listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) are identified.
A listing of endangered indicates the species is in imminent danger of extinction and efforts are being made to ensure its survival as a species.
If you observe a rare, hypothetical, or unlisted mammal, please report it to: Chief Park Naturalist Panther Junction Big Bend National Park, Texas 79834
or fill out a wildlife observation card at any visitor center.
KEY TO ABUNDANCE
COMMON - Average of more than 100 sightings per year; a mammal that you might see during a visit to Big Bend National Park.
UNCOMMON - Average of fewer than 100 sightings per year.
RARE - Average of fewer than 10 sightings per year.
EXTREMELY RARE - Fewer than 10 sightings during past ten years.
SPECIAL NOTE: Species abundance definitions described above do not apply to bats and most rodents.
Abundance ratings for species in these categories are based on records compiled by park researchers.

HYPOTHETICAL SPECIES
ORDER MARSUPIALIA: OPOSSUMS
FAMILY DIDELPHIDAE: OPPOSSUMS

__________________________________________________________________
ORDER XENARTHRA: ARMADILLOS AND SLOTHS
FAMILY DASYPODIDAE: ARMADILLOS
___ Nine-banded Armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) Reports of this species from the Terlingua area and other parts of the Trans-Pecos have been previously written off as being of captives released from other parts of Texas.
This was thought to be the case when a dead individual was discovered in the Rio Grande Village campground in December of 1983.
Because armadillos have been reported crossing bodies of water by walking under water, it is possible that the individual found at Rio Grande Village may have crossed the Rio Grande from Northern Coahuila, Mexico, where armadillo were reported by Starker Leopold in 1959.
__________________________________________________________________
