The Department of Agriculture is willing to help.
Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Richard Rominger will announce the availability of funds at a ceremony at the Johnstown Flood National Memorial Wednesday October 25 at 11:00 a.m.
The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is providing $100,000 to help with equipment and staffing needed to eradicate these weeds.
"This is an opportunity for the USDA to work cooperatively with the National Park Service to control weeds in a critical area" said Rominger.
The mission of the National Park Service is to preserve and maintain the natural and cultural resources of the park and to interpret those resources to the public and the scientific community.
APHIS provides leadership in ensuring the health and care of animals and plants, improving agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and contributing to the national economy and the public health.
They protect American agriculture against the introduction of foreign pests and diseases.
"Completion of this project will advance the mission of both agencies, and it makes sense to work together to eliminate this problem" said Park Manager Joanne Hanley.
One Photo of Giant knotweed leaves of the most significant management problems the National Park Service faces at the Flood Memorial is an invasive weed.
Giant knotweed is a nonnative plant that is rapidly invading riverbank in the historic lakebed.
It currently occupies almost half of the riverbank within the park.
Left untreated, officials expect that it would spread until the entire riverbank within the park is lined with the large, dense stands.
They are extremely persistent and prevent native plants from growing.
These dense stands of knotweed degrade the quality of wildlife habitat, and may promote flooding.
Johnstown Flood National Memorial contains the former Lake Conemaugh lakebed and remains of the Southfork Dam that failed on May 31, 1889.
The resulting flood killed 2,209 people and was one of the worst disasters in American history.
The Memorial averages about 180,000 visitors per year.
It is located at 733 Lake Road, in St. Michael, Pennsylvania.
