What is SPAM?
SPAM is unsolicited commercial e-mail, usually sent out in bulk mailings to large lists of unsuspecting e-mail users.
The word, SPAM, is Internet lingo for any unwanted marketing pitch or announcement that is sent to a consumer or business without prior authorization.
SPAM is essentially the online version of junk mail.
While some SPAM messages are from legitimate businesses, a majority of these e-mails are promoting various scams and schemes or sexually oriented Web sites.

What is the harm with SPAM?
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other businesses lose millions of dollars and hundreds of hours of lost productivity as a result of unsolicited commercial e-mail.
SPAM clogs the Internet, computer systems, and e-mail accounts slowing down operations and at times causing system shutdowns and failures.
Expenses include the cost of new computer hardware to handle the increased flow of mail created by SPAM, filtering software to cut down the flow of unsolicited commercial e-mail, and staff time spent identifying and deleting junk e-mail.
SPAM also hurts consumers.
Many people still pay hourly rates for Internet access, including those who use wireless Internet services and business travelers who download e-mail while on the road.
These consumers have to pay for the time they spend downloading these unsolicited messages to their computer from the Internet.
Most ISPs also limit the space available in account mailboxes for consumers to store e-mail messages.
SPAM fills mailbox space that consumers could utilize for other purposes.
It also becomes inconvenient to sort through when an individual is checking for personal messages in an e-mail account.
The content of SPAM is also a troublesome issue.
While some SPAM messages are from legitimate businesses, a majority of these e-mails are promoting various scams and schemes or sexually oriented Web sites.
Many people become victims of the "get rich quick" schemes in these e-mails.
In other situations, pornographic images and messages end up in the mailboxes of unsuspecting families with children.

How do SPAMmers get my e-mail address?
List compilers use highly automated software programs to scour Web pages, search engines, and chat rooms for e-mail addresses.
They then use these lists to send out SPAM or sell them to others who send out junk e-mail.
Some Web sites use the information they receive from visitors submitting personal information while making a purchase to send SPAM or compile mailing lists for SPAMmers.
The more active you are on the Internet, the more likely you are to receive SPAM.

How can I prevent SPAM?
There are several steps that you can take to reduce your exposure to SPAM.
Check with your ISP to see if they can assist with filtering unsolicited commercial e-mail.
If you receive SPAM, complain to your ISP or to the Network Abuse Clearinghouse.
American Online (AOL) users can go to a special section (keyword: Mail Controls) to learn more about SPAM, request filtering services, and complain about unsolicited commercial e-mail.
Other ISPs also offer similar services, check with your individual service.
If your ISP does not filter unsolicited commercial e-mail, request that it start providing this service.
Obtain your own filtering software for your individual e-mail account.
There are numerous free and for-purchase filtering options available.
Ways to Filter SPAM From Your E-mail
Tips to Avoid Receiving SPAM
Always check a Web site for a privacy policy stating the site will not provide your e-mail address to third parties without your expressed permission.
If you're not familiar with the operations of a Web-based company, look for a reliability seal from TRUSTe or BBBOnline on the company's Web site.
Never respond to SPAM.
While some junk e-mails will request that you opt out of future mailings by sending them an e-mail, responding to SPAM will in most circumstances only confirm that your e-mail account is active and will encourage future mailings.
