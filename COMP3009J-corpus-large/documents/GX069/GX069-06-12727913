Your Credit Report and Credit Score: Get copies of your Credit Reports ($9.00 each) from the 3 major credit reporting agencies to verify that the information in them is correct BEFORE you apply for mortgage financing.
You may also want to get a copy of your current Credit Score (it varies over time) from Fair, Isaac and Co.
Correct any mistakes in your Credit Report by written correspondence with the credit reporting agency; update any paid-off disputed medical or department store charge card information.
The offer of a mortgage to a potential borrower (you) is an extension of credit -- the lender runs the risk that you will not repay in a timely fashion, if at all.
Accordingly, the lender uses your credit report and credit score as a measure of the risk of lending mortgage money to you.
The higher the interest rate on the mortgage you are offered, the higher the lending risk that you are considered to be.
Your Credit Report is a list of your credit cards with payment history and dollar amount of credit line; utility bill payment history; medical bill payment history; tax lien history; bankruptcies; and any unsatisfied legal judgements entered against you (such as child support payments, alimony payments, automobile accident lawsuit judgements, etc.).
If you are unemployed or have recently been denied credit (such as denied a mortgage), you are entitled to a free copy of your Credit Report from the credit reporting agencies if you request it in writing.
Your Credit Score (also known as "FICO Score") is a 3-digit number ranging from 300 to 900 (from very bad to excellent--the higher your score, the better your credit rating) based on your bill-paying history and debt profile.
The major vendor of credit scores is Fair, Isaac and Co.
("FICO").
It uses proprietary mathematical formulas to calculate credit scores, and sells the information to the 3 major credit reporting bureaus.
It is true that if you make multiple applications for mortgage over a period of several months, it may lower your FICO score.
Once you have done your consumer homework and are ready to actually apply for mortgages, try to limit multiple inquiries to a 14-day time period.
FICO reports that they consider that to be "one" set of inquires for consumers who are shopping around for a suitable mortgage.
