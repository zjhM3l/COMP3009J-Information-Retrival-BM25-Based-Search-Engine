CONSPECTUS OF WILD-LIFE PROBLEMS OF EACH PARK
CRATER LAKE
Crater Lake is a mountain-top park, approximately 16 miles square.
Its geographical situation concerning faunal requirements is almost identical with that of Mount Rainier.
There is no winter range for park animals, and the boundaries include no natural faunal unit.
To correct this situation, the boundary should be adjusted as follows: Beginning at the present north boundary, extend the boundary from Desert Ridge northwestward to Bear Butte; follow the mountain crest between the Rogue and Umpqua River drainages southwestward to Whaleback Peak; turn south-southeast following the ridge to Luck Mountain and to the northwest corner of the Rogue River Lumber Company's holding; follow the company's boundary east and south to a point due west of Bessie Peak; continue eastward past Bessie Peak to Goose Egg; then turn northeast, following the Goose Egg ridge about 2 miles to the present south boundary by Pumice Flat.
Such an extension would include enough of the Rogue River drainage to provide winter habitat for the park fauna, with the added protection of a mountain crest to further set apart such a faunal unit from outside influences.
The present park boundary is laid out very much as a national monument; that is, simply a line drawn around one thing of interest - the crater itself.
This is true of Mount Rainier and Lassen Volcanic also.
According to citizens who have been in the Crater Lake region since 1870, the country was rich in animal life before civilization destroyed it.
There is still time to bring back this valuable heritage and make of Crater Lake National Park a magnificent wild-life retreat.
With its wonderful hemlock forest and the incomparable crater, it should become once more the teeming wilderness of pioneer days.
BLACK BEAR (Euarctos americanus).
- The encouraging feature about the bear situation at Crater Lake is that natural food is abundant.
Consequently, no artificial feeding of bears is necessary in order to keep them in the park or to have them seen by visitors.
They may be seen often along the trails and roads, which is, perhaps, the ideal presentation of animal life - a natural one without harmful consequences to either man or animal.
The present limited park area, however, will not be sufficient safeguard for bears as the surrounding territory becomes more intensively utilized.
GRIZZLY BEAR (Ursus klamathensis).
- Judge Colvig, of Medford, Oreg., who has been in the Crater Lake region since 1863, says that grizzly bears were abundant in the Rogue River valley, ranging even up into what is now the park.
The last grizzly, "Club-foot," was killed in the "early seventies," according to Judge Colvig.
This member of the park fauna is gone permanently.
PACIFIC MARTEN (Martes caurina caurina).
- Pacific marten have been seen in the park each winter.
However, they may roam many miles, and are not sufficiently protected in the narrow confines of the park.
The late Chief Ranger William C. Godfrey reported evidence of poachers' trap lines inside the south and west boundaries of the park.
Aside from the need of more protected territory, the greatest present need of marten, and all fur-bearers in the park, is immunity from winter trapping.
The park needs winter patrolling.
PACIFIC FISHER (Martes pennanti pacifica).
- Fisher are said to be present in the park, but are rare.
They also need added range and strict winter protection.
WOLVERINE (Gulo sp.).
- We could get no evidence of wolverine in the park.
OTTER (Lutra canadensis).
- Otter used to be in the Rogue River drainage just west of the park, and may have been up in the park.
Judge Colvig reports that the Klamath Indians used to sell otter skins which they had procured in the Crater Lake region.
With sufficient refuge, otter could return to this region.
CASCADE RED FOX (Vulpes cascadensis).
- The foxes of Crater Lake are said to be mostly of the "cross" phase.
Their fur is valuable, and they will need protection if they are to remain in the park.
COYOTE (Canis lestes).
- Coyotes are numerous, but have caused no difficulties yet.
TIMBER WOLF (Canis gigas).
- Several of the early inhabitants informed us that timber wolves used to be abundant in the Crater Lake region.
Probably they are gone, but it is not impossible that a few remain in the Cascades which, if given sanctuary, might be a part of the fauna in an enlarged Crater Lake National Park.
MOUNTAIN LION (Felis oregonensis oregonensis).
- Mountain lions have been so persistently hunted that they are rare in the region.
There has been no sign of lions in the park for several years, to our knowledge.
It would be impossible to keep mountain lions in the present park confines.
Yet to lose it entirely from the park fauna would be very undesirable.
BEAVER (Castor canadensis pacificus).
- Beaver were at one time abundant in the Crater Lake region.
Judge Colvig recalls seeing beavers at Annie Spring on his first trip into the park in 1863.
They are reported to be west of the park along Copeland Creek.
A few migrated into the park, moving up Copeland Creek, in the summer of 1931, but their ponds were deserted when seen in the latter part of September.
If sufficiently protected, they should flourish in the Rogue River area, where there is an abundance of food.
COLUMBIAN BLACK-TAILED DEER (Odocoileus columbianus columbianus).
- Deer are not abundant in the park.
Early inhabitants say that they have increased somewhat in the last 10 years, but that they are far below their former numbers.
There is no winter range for deer in the park.
With the first snow they migrate down into the Rogue River valley, wintering mainly above Prospect.
In seasons of early snow this migration exposes them to hunting outside the park.
The deer situation can not be improved until the upper Rogue River valley is protected.
If it were made into a game refuge, the deer would profit, but that is not sufficient assurance for all the other forms of animal life.
It should be made a part of Crater Lake National Park, to insure the safety and perpetuation of the wild life of the region.
ROOSEVELT ELK (Cervus canadensis occidentalis).
- Elk (very probably the large Roosevelt elk) used to roam the entire Crater Lake region, according to early reports.
They were practically gone by 1875.
Occasionally elk are seen in the park, but these are American wapiti transplanted from Yellowstone Park.
In July, 1929, Chief Ranger Godfrey saw five elk on Sun Creek, and in October he saw one near the Pumice Desert.
On September 15, 1930, he saw three elk along the south boundary.
With sufficient territory, it might be possible to reintroduce the Roosevelt elk, but with the present boundaries nothing can be done.
The foregoing brief account gives some idea of the faunal complications at Crater Lake, and the necessity of extending the boundary as outlined.
It is hoped that the value of such a wild-life sanctuary will be fully appreciated.
Further extension to include the Diamond Lake area does not appear to be necessary from the wild-life stand point.
