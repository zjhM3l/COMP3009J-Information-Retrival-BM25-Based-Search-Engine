Avoiding SPAM __________________________________________________________________
JUST SAY NO
Review the privacy policy of any web site requesting your e-mail address, or any other personal information, to ensure that your information won't be provided to third parties.
A web site's privacy policy should specifically state that it will not provide your e-mail address to another party without your express permission.
If the web site doesn't have a privacy policy, don't provide it with your personal information.
OPEN A PUBLIC E-MAIL ACCOUNT
Register for free e-mail accounts (major providers include email.com, HotMail, and Yahoo) or a different AOL screen name for public postings and web-site registrations.
Create another private e-mail account through your Internet Service Provider (ISP), business, or other source that is used only with friends and associates.
When SPAM fills up your public account, you can dump it out without having to sort through your personal messages in your private account.
ALTER YOUR NEWSGROUP ADDRESS
If you must use your regular e-mail address when posting to newsgroups or chatrooms, insert NO-SPAM in the "From:" or "Reply to:" fields (for example: NO-SPAM/John_Doe@isp.net).
Any unsolicited e-mail sent to this address will be returned to sender, and those who wish to reply to your message can simply delete "NO-SPAM" and send their message to your real address.
DON'T RESPOND
Never respond to junk e-mail.
Although SPAMmers say they will remove you from their mailing list if you send them an "opt out" request, many use your response as an indicator that your account is active and will send you additional unsolicited commercial e-mail or sell your address to other marketers.
NEVER BUY ANYTHING ADVERTISED IN SPAM
The reason people send unsolicited commercial e-mail is because they make money when people buy the products or services the junk mail is promoting.
If no one buys the products advertised in SPAM, the incentive to send junk e-mail is reduced.
FILTER YOUR E-MAIL
Check with your ISP to see if they can assist with filtering unsolicited commercial e-mail.
America Online (AOL) users can go to a special section (keyword: Mail Controls) to learn more about SPAM, request filtering services, and complain about unsolicited commercial e-mail.
Other ISPs also offer similar services, check with your individual service.
If your ISP doesn't offer a filtering service, ask them to provide the service.
If SPAM is still slipping through, install your own filter.
There are numerous filters available to the public both for sale and for free.
