The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission") alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY
1.
Defendant David Mobley Sr. (Mobley Sr.) conceived and carried out a $59 million fraud on the investors in four hedge funds he created and managed: Maricopa Investment Fund, Ltd., Maricopa Index Hedge Fund, Ensign Trading Corporation, and Maricopa Financial Corporation.
2.
Mobley Sr. claimed to have $450 million under management and told his investors that he invested their funds primarily in major stock index products using computer trading models he developed.
He claimed to have achieved rates of return averaging approximately 51 per cent per year, net of his management fee of 30 percent.
He declined to have his funds audited, explaining to investors that audits would risk divulging his secret and highly profitable trading strategies.
3.
In fact, Mobley Sr. had no more than about $35 million under management and his trading program was generally unprofitable.
He lost the bulk of the investors' funds through a series of failed business ventures in, for example, a mortgage company, a golf and country club development, a research and polling company, a cigar lounge, and a plan to build a stadium on a golf course.
Mobley Sr. also used investor funds to make charitable contributions of approximately $3.5 million and to support a lavish lifestyle for himself and his family and associates, including an expensive vacation home near Vail, Colorado, sports cars, expensive jewelry, and numerous trips on private jets.
4.
Mobley Sr. estimates that since September 1992, more than 170 investors contributed a total of $140 million into his funds.
Most of the investors were wealthy, though some were of modest means and entrusted Mobley Sr. with their IRAs.
Only about $33 million of investor assets, including about $5 million in illiquid assets, remain.
Taking into account prior redemptions which Mobley Sr. estimates at less than $48 million (which included substantial profits paid to the redeeming investors at the expense of the remaining investors), total investor losses appear to exceed $59 million.
5.
By 1996, at the latest, the investment scheme involved, among other things, the management of a de facto commodity pool and the trading of commodity futures and options, in which substantial commodities-related trading losses ultimately were both incurred and concealed from investors.
Specifically, defendants omitted to disclose to investors that their funds would be traded in commodity futures and options.
Further, Mobley Sr. caused certain defendants to issue reports to investors that fraudulently overstated the profitability of their investments while concealing the fact that substantial losses had resulted from trading investor funds in commodity futures and options.
Finally, Mobley Sr. misappropriated investor funds and converted them to his own use and benefit.
6.
Thus, Defendants have engaged, are engaging in, and are about to engage in acts and practices which violate the anti-fraud provisions set forth in Sections 4b and 4o(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended ("Act"), 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6o(1) (1994).
7.
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 13a-1 (1994), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices, and to compel compliance with the provisions of the Act.
In addition, the Commission seeks restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties, and such other equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.
8.
Given Defendants' pattern of fraudulent activity, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, they are likely to continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint, as more fully described below.
The Commission brings this action on an emergency basis to stop the fraud and to preserve the remaining assets for the investors' benefit.
II.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
9.
The Act prohibits fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of commodity futures contracts and options, and establishes a comprehensive system for regulating the purchase and sale of commodity futures and options contracts.
This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and all parties hereto pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (1994), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall appear that such person has engaged, is engaging or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.
10.
Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (1994), in that Defendants transact business in this district, and the acts and practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring or are about to occur within this district, among other places.

FACTS
A. STATUTORY BACKGROUND
20.
A commodity pool is defined in Commission Regulation 4.10(d)(1) , 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.10(d)(1999), as any investment trust, syndicate or similar form of enterprise engaged in the business of investing its pooled funds in trading commodity futures and options.
21.
A commodity pool operator ("CPO") is defined in Section 1a(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1(a)(4)(1994), as any person engaged in a business that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who, in connection therewith solicits, accepts or receives from others, funds, securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other forms of securities or otherwise, for the purpose of trading in any commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market.
B. DEFENDANTS' BUSINESS PRACTICES
22.
Starting in or around 1992 and continuing through the present, Defendant Mobley Sr. induced numerous investors to make sizeable investments through various Defendant entities, which pooled customer funds ostensibly for the purpose of trading securities and other equity investments.
An Offering Circular for MIF and MIHF used during the relevant period states that the partnerships would be "investing in publicly traded securities," and a solicitation brochure created by Defendants in early 1999 indicated that investor funds would be traded in equity options and other equity investments.
23.
During the relevant period, Mobley Sr. accepted or caused to be accepted a total of approximately $140 million in funds in MIF and MIHF accounts (from U.S. investors), and in accounts in the name of Ensign (from offshore investors).
24.
Mobley Sr. opened or caused to be opened several Ensign trading accounts with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
("Morgan Stanley"), a securities and futures brokerage house located in New York City, and directed that all funds invested in MIF and MIHF be transmitted to Ensign's accounts at Morgan Stanley.
Thus, Ensign's Morgan Stanley accounts received funds both directly from investors and indirectly through MIF and MIHF.
25.
Investor funds were also transferred between and among other Defendants, including MIIC, MFC and IAM, passing through Ensign from time to time.
26.
By 1996, at the latest, some of the funds transferred to Ensign were used to trade commodity futures and options trading accounts at various futures commission merchants, and eventually transferred to accounts opened at Morgan Stanley.
Thus, Mobley Sr. omitted to disclose to investors the material fact that he intended to and did use their funds for trading in futures and options, and traded their funds without appropriate authorization.
27.
In 1999 alone, unauthorized commodity futures and options transactions in the Ensign accounts resulted in losses of over three million dollars of investor funds.
Rather than reporting to investors the fact that losses were being incurred from futures and options trading with their funds, Mobley Sr. made or caused to be made false, deceptive and/or misleading statements in the form of account statements sent to investors that falsely reflected huge profits in the investors' personal accounts, while failing to set forth the facts that their funds were being used to trade commodity futures and options and that net losses were flowing from such trading.
28.
Mobley Sr. also overstated the size and returns of his funds to the Commission in both oral and written misrepresentations, as well as the source of funds in the commodity futures and options trading accounts, and the purpose for which funds were traded in those accounts.
29.
Further, during the relevant period, Mobley Sr. misappropriated investor funds and converted them to his personal use, which included investments in other businesses, the purchase of luxury cars and homes for himself and his family, and cash payments and gifts to family members and others.
On information and belief, some of the funds he misappropriated and converted to his own use and benefit derived from investor funds traded in the commodity futures and options accounts in Ensign's name at Morgan Stanley.
