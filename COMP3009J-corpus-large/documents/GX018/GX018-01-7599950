CANNING SPAM 5/18/01 __________________________________________________________________ If you have an e-mail account, you know about junk e-mail.
Junk e-mail, also known as spam, are those bizarre messages that appear in your e-mail inbox when you log onto your account, messages from unfamiliar addresses often with strange subject headings.
More often than not, these unfamiliar e-mail messages sent to large numbers of e-mail users -- are advertisements for dubious chain letters, get-rich quick schemes or links to pornography.
Before 1994, most Internet users rarely received junk or commercial e-mail.
This unwritten protocol of refraining from sending unsolicited e-mail was shattered when two lawyers, seeking to drum up immigration and green card business, spammed 20 million e-mail users with a message soliciting new clients.
Since that particularly egregious incident, spamming has not only become more commonplace, it has grown progressively worse.
For marketers, sending unsolicited commercial e-mail is an attractive alternative to traditional and more expensive marketing efforts, like direct mail.
E-mail solicitations not only cost less but are also far less expensive to distribute.
The cost for spammers can be as little as $10 for a list of a million e-mail addresses.
These costs are generally fixed for marketers and do not increase with the volume of messages sent.
This only exacerbates the junk e-mail problem by encouraging spammers to send as many messages as possible.
To most of us, receiving junk e-mail is just a nuisance -- a cost of maintaining an e-mail account.
Spammers would likely argue that recipients who do not like to receive junk e-mail can simply delete unwanted messages.
But because of the proliferation of e-mail accounts for personal and business use, the ramifications of junk e-mail imposes far greater costs to individual Internet users and to Internet service providers than first meets the eye.
According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the vast majority of junk e-mail contains indecent or misleading information.
By one estimate, 90 percent of junk e-mail is fraudulent.
For consumers assessed fees based on the amount of time they spend online, reading and deleting junk e-mail eats up valuable online time.
The economic cost of these wasted hours online is estimated at almost $90 million per year.
And for parents whose children send and receive e-mail, monitoring for pornographic or obscene e-mail messages imposes an additional burden.
For Internet service providers the economic and technical burden imposed by junk e-mail can be even greater.
The enormous volume of junk messages bouncing around cyberspace can slow delivery of time-sensitive e-mail and can cause network failures.
When an Internet provider is not operational, users cannot surf the web or access their accounts, and businesses that rely on the Internet cannot conduct business transactions or receive orders.
Meanwhile, service providers must spend time and resources repairing servers that crash under the weight of unsolicited junk messages.
Junk e-mail has crossed a threshold.
No longer simply annoying, unsolicited messages have entered the realm where they are disruptive for businesses and detrimental to consumers.
That is why I am an original cosponsor of legislation that would, among other things, increase the liability of marketers who peddle junk e-mail.
The "Can Spam Act of 2001" would make it illegal to include false information about a sender's e-mail address in the header of a commercial e-mail.
In addition, the legislation would prohibit misleading subject headers or messages that omit return e-mail addresses and would prohibit sending unsolicited e-mail to a consumer who has opted-out of receiving such e-mails.
Finally, the bill grants the FTC the right to sue spammers and would allow state attorneys general to pursue monetary damages from marketers who send spam.
As Internet use and reliance on e-mail continues to permeate all aspects of our economy and our national culture, it is worth remembering that the Internet as we know it is only a decade or so old.
But in the years ahead, as the Internet continues its metamorphosis into a more commercial enterprise, certain restrictions are appropriate to stop misleading marketing practices.
This legislation is an important step in that direction -- providing recourse for Internet providers who suffer damages from excessive e-mail while protecting businesses that rely on the Internet, and consumers who suffer from a barrage of fraudulent and obscene messages.
