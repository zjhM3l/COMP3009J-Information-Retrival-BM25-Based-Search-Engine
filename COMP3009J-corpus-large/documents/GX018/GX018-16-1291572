1790: Heads of Families: Pennsylvania.
Gov Pub C 3.11:P 38.
For persons residing within the CITY limits of Philadelphia in 1790, it is very important to see the census on microfilm because places of residence and occupations are shown for many of these residents.
Other indexes in the Heads of Families series are available for Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, North Carolina, Maryland, New York, Massachusetts, South Carolina, and Virginia.
Use the Heads of Families series in conjunction with A Century of Population Growth From the First Census of the U. S. to the Twelfth 1790-1900, Gov Pub C 3.2:P 81, which lists the surnames of heads of households for the entire U. S. in 1790 in one continuous alphabetical list and shows the distribution of surnames by state.
All of the Heads of Families volumes are collectively indexed in the American Genealogical and Biographical Index.

In 1840, persons drawing pensions based on a veteran's military service were listed.
A list of these pensioners was published as A Census of Pensioners for Revolutionary or Military Services....
973.34 Un34c.
This list should be used with A General Index to a Census of Pensioners for Revolutionary or Military Services....

1850: The index is Pennsylvania 1850 Census Index.
929.3748 J137p 1850.
See the front matter in this index.
There is also a separate index for Philadelphia: "Heads of Families" Index, 1850 Federal Census, City of Philadelphia.
929.3 P386h.
1860: There are four separate indexes for Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania 1860 Philadelphia.
Gov Pub A 22-1:P53.
Pennsylvania 1860 East.
Gov Pub A 22-1:E77.
Pennsylvania 1860 West.
Gov Pub A 22-1:W52.
Pennsylvania 1860 Pittsburgh.
Gov Pub A 22-1:P687.
See the front matter in these indexes.
1870: In 1870 there were two census enumerations taken in Philadelphia.
The index to the first enumeration is Philadelphia, PA 1870 Census Index.
929.3748 P53p.
Look at the addenda in the front of this index for Wards 27 and 28.
There is no index to the second enumeration.
There are, however, descriptions on microfilm of many of the second enumeration boundaries.
These boundaries are also shown graphically in a series of drawings at the Map Department.
1880: The SOUNDEX index to this census in not available at FLP.
However, An Urban Finding Aid for the 1880 Federal Population Census of Philadelphia, 304.6021 St62u, is available.
This document gives enumeration district boundaries for 1880 and, in many cases, is a better way to find persons and families on this census.
Also see Report on the Social Statistics of Cities, 1880 census, vol. 18, part 1, pp. 773-849 at the Government Publications Department for an excellent description of Philadelphia at the time of the 1880 census.
An every-name index and a detailed extract of the census itself is on a set of CDs that is available for purchase from any Family History Center of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
1890: The 1890 census population schedules for most of the United States and almost all of Pennsylvania were destroyed in a fire.
However, a special schedule for 1890 is available at FLP that lists military pensioners (or any other person drawing a pension based on a military person's service) who lived in Philadelphia at the time of the census.
To use these microfilm reels effectively, you must know the ward and enumeration district in which the pension recipient lived.
This can usually be determined by using city directories and the 1890 enumeration district descriptions on microfilm.
The special schedules are arranged on three microfilm rolls as follows:
Roll 78: ED 1 (1st Wd.) to ED 152 (8th Wd. - part); ED 300 (16th Wd.) to ED 499 (23d Wd. - part); ED 640 (In SE corner of the 28th Wd.); Institutions: Hospitals, the Navy Yard, etc.
Roll 79: ED 152 (8th Wd. - part) to ED 299 (15th Wd.); Miscellaneous.
Roll 80: ED 500 (23rd Wd. - part), to ED 821 (34th Wd.); ED 640 is near the end of Roll 78.
1900, 1910, 1920: The SOUNDEX indexes for these censuses are not available at FLP. Enumeration district boundary descriptions are available on microfilm for 1900, 1910, and 1920. Use city directories to determine the street address and ward where the family lived, consult the enumeration district boundary descriptions on microfilm to determine the most likely enumeration districts, place the appropriate reel for the ward on the microfilm reader, scroll to the most likely enumeration districts, then look down the left side of the census schedules until you find the street address.
1930: Soundex indexes are available for the following states only: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky (part), Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia (part).
None of these indexes are available at the Free Library.
There is no index for PA.
To find someone in Philadelphia in the 1930 census: find out where they lived by using a City Directory, look in Philadelphia Enumeration Districts of 1930 (available at the reference desk at the Mid-Atlantic branch of the National Archives), place the address in an enumeration district by using the conversion charts provided, place the enumeration district on a microfilm reel by using the conversion charts provided, then find the person by searching the relevant enumeration district on the microfilm.
Other resources that may help when using the 1930 census are Pennsylvania Enumeration Districts of 1930 and Guide to 1930 Pennsylvania City and County Directories (both available at the reference desk at the Mid-Atlantic branch of the National Archives).
