G. RESEARCH ON RELATED TOPICS
The legislative mandate for this report requires inclusion of information about "relevant research on the SSI program by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and others."
Section 1 of this appendix describes major ongoing projects.
Section 2 presents a bibliography of studies that have been conducted by public and private entities regarding SSI payment levels, recipients, and reform proposals.

Ongoing Research
a.
Analyses Using SSA's Model of Financial Eligibility for SSI
Using Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data matched to administrative records, SSA researchers have developed a model of financial eligibility for SSI that has been used to estimate the rate of participation among eligible elderly and the effects of various options to modify the SSI program (see Davies et al. 2001/2002).
The model suggests that the rate of participation among eligible elderly was about 63 percent in 1991.
The model was also utilized to simulate the potential effects of several approaches to expand the SSI program to fight poverty among the elderly.
Approaches focusing on incremental changes in the Federal benefit rate, the general income exclusion, and the asset test appear roughly equally effective in reducing the poverty gap among the elderly on a cost-equivalent basis, while two approaches focusing on relaxing the earned income exclusion are less effective (Davies, Rupp, and Strand, forthcoming).
The financial eligibility model has also been utilized to study eligibility for Medicare buy-in programs (see Rupp and Sears 2000; Sears 2001/2002).
b. National Survey of Children with Families
Due to the widely acknowledged shortcomings of existing data sources for evaluating the effects of welfare reform on SSI children and for tracking SSI children unaffected by welfare reform, SSA has conducted a national survey of children with disabilities.
Among the questions the survey answers are the following:
* What is the cost of caring for a disabled child? * What are the uses of SSI benefits? * What alternative sources of care are available to disabled children who lose SSI benefits? * How is quality of life and utilization of medical services impacted by gaining or losing SSI benefits? * What is the impact of receiving childhood SSI benefits on parental labor force participation?
The data from the survey will allow SSA to evaluate future changes to the SSI program that may affect children and to further evaluate the effects of welfare reform on SSI children and their families.
Data collection for the survey was completed in summer, 2002.
SSA received an edited and weighted data file in fall 2002, and SSA expects imputed and recoded data files in spring, 2003.
c. Evaluation of the State Partnership Initiative Return-to-Work Demonstrations
In the fall of 1998, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education announced the award of 12 SSA cooperative agreements and 6 Rehabilitation Service Administration systems-change grants under State Partnership Initiatives (SPI).
SPI projects are designed to assist States in developing alternative program structures and service delivery systems to increase employment of persons with disabilities who are receiving SSI or SSDI.
Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.
(MPR), under contract to SSA, designed and tested an evaluation methodology for the SSA SPI projects.
The core evaluation will rely on SSA administrative data and will use appropriate methods to define comparison groups and determine the net impact of SPI interventions on participants.
A supplemental net-outcome evaluation will take advantage of any additional data provided by individual SPI projects.
MPR provided its final report in September 2002.
The majority of the SPI projects will end in 2004.
However, four SPI projects will be continued until the end of 2005 because these projects focused on SSI waivers to increase the incentives to return to work.
The final net-outcome evaluations will occur in 2006.
d. Evaluation of the Ticket to Work
The evaluation of the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency program will examine the following:
* Total and net costs of the program, * The impact of the program on beneficiary work outcomes and reliance on SSA benefits, * The individual and service provision characteristics of service providers and provider networks, * The adequacy of incentives for providers to supply services, * The appeal of the program among the eligible population, and * The satisfaction of participants with the program in general.
To the degree possible, the evaluation will utilize information from SSA administrative data and from the Ticket to Work program implementation process.
Such data will be insufficient, however, to cover many of the evaluation topics required under the legislation, particularly the analysis of nonparticipation among eligible beneficiaries.
A significant survey effort will therefore be required to supply the necessary supplemental information to meet these evaluation requirements.
The design of the evaluation is complete (The Lewin Group), and SSA expects to issue a contract to implement the evaluation in spring 2003.
SSA held a technical workshop in May 2002 to obtain advice from outside experts on the adequacy of incentives for providers to supply services to people with significant disabilities (Rupp and Bell, 2003).
The initial process evaluation detailing the start-up issues being faced by the Ticket program has also been completed (The Lewin Group, 2003).
