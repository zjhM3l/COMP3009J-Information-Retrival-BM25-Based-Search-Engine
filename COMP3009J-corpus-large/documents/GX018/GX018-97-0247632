Research Objectives:
My research in wool is directed toward developing new technologies for investigating chemical, physical, and biological properties and innovative processing methods to improve and add value to this commodity, an agricultural coproduct of the American lamb industry.
The following investigative approaches are designed to assist our stakeholders and customer base, the American sheep and textile industries and the consumer: * Apply enzymatic processes to selectively modify the surface of wool to whiten, biopolish, and confer shrinkage resistance and comfort to wool without causing loss in tactile, aesthetic, and end-use performance properties.
* Chemically alter wool through functional group modification for improved performance and novel enduses.

* Develop analytical FTIR spectroscopic techniques to record chemical changes in wool fibers and fabrics and to determine the effects of natural and synthetic agents on keratin structure.
* Apply the method of Digital Image Analysis with algorithms to examine fiber, yarn and fabric structures in historic and modern textiles to measure color uniformity, dye penetration, quality of union shade, and structural integrity.
