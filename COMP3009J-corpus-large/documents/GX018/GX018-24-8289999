Land Use Plan; Cultural Landscape Report; Boxley Valley; Buffalo NR. 1985.
72 pgs.
Boxley is a well preserved example of a rural Ozark mountains valley.
It comprises 8,000 acres in the upper portion of the Buffalo National River and is the most significant cultural landscape in the designated area.
The valley is a collection of tangible cultural features that exemplify the traditional Ozark mountains valley settlement pattern.
The vernacular landscape includes a collection of agricultural fields and architectural features.
Buffalo National River was established in 1972 to conserve and interpret the area and preserve the river for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.
In 1975 a Master Plan for the Park was developed.
It classified Boxley Valley as a private use zone, to perpetuate the pastoral scene.
However, the park service has subsequently acquired fee-simple ownership for most of the valley.
Many sellers have retained use and occupancy agreements for up to 25 years.
The purpose of this Land use Plan/Cultural Landscape Report is to provide a management strategy for Boxley Valley, to supplement the proposals of the park master plan.
The new plan provides more detailed guidance on resource management, land use, visitor use, development, and land management agreements for the valley.
It responds to current management problems such as vacant farmhouses, and new legal authorities such as the historic properties leasing program.
The report is divided into two principal sections: the resource analysis and based on this, the management plan.
The resource analysis discusses the valley in its regional context and evaluates its natural and cultural resources.
The management plan is subsequently developed to guide management and use within the valley.
It is proposed to implement the original concept of a private use zone as outlined in the Master
Plan.
Private ownership of land will be encouraged, vacant farmlands will be resold subject to deed restrictions and the owners of use and occupancy or life estate agreements will be offered the opportunity to reacquire their lands and other NPS lands in certain areas.
This approach will aim to balance resource preservation and private use, and protect the natural and historical character of Boxley valley, whilst allowing and encouraging natural evolution of the rural landscape.
The park service will control the degree and direction change through a comprehensive program of positive incentives and restrictive regulations.
The management plan divides the valley into six management districts based on the natural and cultural resources considered in the resource analysis.
They comprise the river corridor, forest, agricultural, community development, park development and transportation corridor.
The character and purpose of each is briefly described.
The districts provide a zoning tool to aid management planning in the valley.
Management guidance on the following is provided: resource management, land use, visitor use and development, management agreements.

Development Plan/Cultural Landscape Report, Erbie Area, Buffalo National River.
1986.
23 pgs.
The Erbie study area in the Ozarks forms part of the National River which was designated in 1972.
The area is made up of lands roughly within a two mile radius of the Erbie ford on the river.
The area was settled by pioneers from the East at the beginning of the 1830s and the vernacular landscape includes the former Erbie townsite, open fields, the Hickman farmstead, a boat launch, private camping and access to the Fitton (Beauty cave).
The purpose of this development plan/cultural landscape report is to provide a management strategy for Erbie, and expand on the outline guidance contained in the Master Plan for Buffalo River.
The primary issue is to ensure that the location, size and character of facilities needed to provide essential visitor services do not conflict with the natural and cultural resource management objectives for the area.
The study was carried out by a multi disciplinary team, including a planner, landscape architect, historical architect, historian, and park superintendent.
The report, first, describes the natural and cultural resources of the area.
Natural resources include the river, landscape, forest communities, wildlife and geology.
The area is considered to provide opportunities for hiking, picnicking, nature study, fishing, camping and interpretation of cultural resources.
The cultural landscape is considered to have evolved by mans utilization of the land and adaption to the natural setting.
Cultural landscape components include the field pattern, fence rows, road network converging at the Erbie townsite, river and creek fords, swinging bridges and cemeteries.
The Erbie landscape includes about 50 historic structures and ruins, which form a collection of vernacular Ozark architecture and a sample of building practices employed in the area between the 1880s and 1950s.
The report states that much of the integrity of the Erbie study area has disappeared with the dismantling of many structures and the deterioration of others.
No analysis has been undertaken to assess the relative significance of the landscape, however one farmstead, the Parker-Hickman Farm, is considered to meet National Register Criteria and is recommended for nomination.
Options for management of this historic district are given.
For the wider landscape it is recommended that the Park Service manage the Erbie area as a historic zone, but with the minimum intervention required to preserve the cultural landscape.
There will be no attempt at restoration, reconstruction or rehabilitation.
In order to perpetuate the cultural landscape scene, agricultural activities such as haying and livestock will be encouraged.
If this is impractical the fields will be maintained through periodic bush hogging or burning.
Extensive recommendations are made for development of the area for visitor use, compatible with its cultural and natural resources.
Guidance is contained regarding river access, campgrounds, trails, picnic areas, Fitton cave, roads, and the ranger residence.
An estimate of the costs of construction for the new facilities is given.
An appendix lists and describes the historic structures and features in the area.

McCoy, Chandler and Burghardt, John E. Special Study: Rush Historic District, Buffalo NR. 1989.
The former town of Rush is located on the banks of the Buffalo National River.
It is important because of its prehistoric archaeological interest and more recent history as a mining town and is on the National Register of Historic Places.
At the peak of the mining boom between 1915 and 1919 Rush was thriving, with ten mining companies and thirteen mines within its confines.
Today Rush is an uninhabited 'ghost town', with only five standing dwellings, a general store, livery, blacksmith and stone smelter and the remnants and ruins of former buildings and mines.
A Development Concept Plan (DCP) was approved for Rush in 1986.
It proposed stabilization of the wooden structures, addition of
a trail system, interpretation of historic mining features and upgrading of facilities for recreation.
The aim of this special study is to provide preservation alternatives for Rush, some of which expand on those set out within the DCP.
The report was prepared by an architectural technician and a mining engineer technician and involved consultation with an archaeologist, historical architect and park historian.
The report is divided into three sections.
The first covers the historical development of Rush including prehistoric habitation.
Archaeological investigation has shown that the area was inhabited by nomadic hunters and gatherers as early as 8000 BC.
Seven significant periods of activity and development at Rush are defined on the National Registrar nomination form: pre-mining, first significant mining (1885-1893), second significant mining (1898- 1904), Boom (1915-1919), post-boom mining (1925-1931), Recreation (1932-1971), National Park Service (1972-present).
Each of these periods is described and illustrated.
The built form of the town is analyzed, and includes a discussion of topography and land use, circulation networks and building types.
The various types of mines and development of mining within the district are also described.
The second section of the report looks at existing conditions and use patterns in the town.
The existing features which could be incorporated in the interpretation of Rush's evolution are identified and described.
These features include standing structures, foundation ruins, road traces, landscape components and mines.
The condition of the structures, roads and mines are assessed and the current use of the area for recreation described.
It is estimated that Rush receives approximately 30, 000 visitors annually.
The biggest threat to the extant cultural resources is considered to be deterioration through natural forces, although recreation pressure is also having an impact.
The third and final section of the report presents options for future management of the park.
Four alternatives are given:
i) To move from the present management policy of emergency stabilization to one of benign neglect.
ii) To continue the present administrative, maintenance and interpretive activities based on the 1986 DCP.
iii) To expand the current DCP policies to include comprehensive stabilization and enhanced interpretation of Rush's historic structures and sites.
iv) To restore the standing structures and stabilize the ruins.
(No one approach is favored above the others.)
Finally, areas for further research are suggested.
The appendices include a schedule of NPS undertakings and the mines safety report.

Chaco Culture National Historical Park (CHCU)
Judge, James W.
The Development of a Complex Cultural Ecosystem in the Chaco Basin, Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
1976.
16 pgs.
This paper views the Bonito Phase in Chaco Canyon as the end product of a gradually maturing cultural ecosystem which developed in the San Juan basin from about 500 AD to 1200 AD.
A basic assumption is that cultural ecosystems increase in diversity and stability during the maturation process in a fashion similar to other ecosystems.
Diversity is measured by the number of internal links between system components in the form of trade routes, as well as the number and nature of items traded.
It is suggested that the cultural system developed as a resource redistribution network linking Chaco Canyon with surrounding areas in order to compensate for fluctuating local environments.
Initially based on reciprocity through kinship ties, the system matured into an increasingly complex and formalized trade network.
Chaco Canyon emerged in the mid 900s as an essential component of the entire ecosystem, integral to and supported by the network of trade links due to its central location, the development of the society was, thus, no longer limited by the carrying capacity of the canyon environment and the population was able to expand as illustrated, today, by the large number of archaeological sites from this period.
At the peak of the Bonito Phase (1100 -1200 AD), the trade links may have expanded to include formal economic ties with areas as distant as Mexico in an effort to increase system stability.
Its demise around 1200 AD is seen as a function of environmental perturbations at the peripheral sites, initiating resource depletion to a degree which exceeded the limits of the system as a whole.
In this paper environmental and cultural data are used to support this theoretical model of development.

Fort Smith National Historic Site (FOSM)
Coleman, Roger E. and Dollar, Clyde D. Historic Landscape at the Fort Smith National Historic Site (1817-1896).
1984.
82 pgs.
Fort Smith National Historic Site, Arkansas incorporates two historic military installations, the latter of which also served as a jail and courtroom for the U.S District Court.
The site encompasses 16 acres, and is bounded on the west by the Poteau and Arkansas Rivers and is enclosed by the City of Fort Smith on the remaining three sides.
Military and judicial use of the site spanned a total of 79 years between 1817 and 1896.
The site has subsequently been extensively altered from its historic scene particularly by urban development.
The purpose of this report is to document the historic landscape at the fort to assist future landscape development projects.
The report begins by summarizing the historical background of the site.
It is divided into three major periods: (i) First Fort 1817 - 1824, (ii) Second Fort 1838 - 1871, (iii) Judicial 1872 - 1896.
Following this historical overview, the environment of the site is described: the physiography, soils and geology, climate, and vegetation are all summarized.
A list is given of extant vegetation at the site.
The second main section of the reports describes resources and methods used in the study.
The research was based primarily on historic documents, these included Government Land Office records, written descriptions, photographs and maps.
Each of these sources is evaluated.
In addition to the historical sources, an analysis of pollen collected at the site was conducted to provide information concerning past species presence.
As a result of the research three maps or landscape reconstructions, one for each of the historic periods of Fort Smith were developed.
The report describes the natural landscape and vegetation of the site and the cultural landscape of the first fort, second fort, and judicial periods.
The natural vegetation is divided into the bottomland forest, cane-brake, upland forest, and upland prairie.
The cultural landscape descriptions document structures, vegetation, and paths and roads for each of the three historic periods.
Historic landscape elements beyond the park boundaries are also described.
It is concluded that by relying on historical documentation it has been possible to arrive at a reasonable reconstruction of the 1817 landscape, and to trace its evolution over the following 80 years from a natural to a cultural landscape.
The reconstructions of the three significant periods are intended to assist future landscape management projects at Fort Smith.
However several limitations in the reconstructions are recognized and these are outlined.
Recommendations are made to ensure that any future landscaping work is historically accurate, for example it is suggested that any structure, such as paths, to be reinstated such be archaeologically verified.

Landscape Management Plan.
1986.
56 pgs.
Fort Smith National Historic Site in Arkansas was designated in 1961 to preserve the original site of the Fort which was one of the first U.S. military posts in the territory.
The site also includes land associated with a second fort and the federal court where Judge Parker served for 21 years.
It covers a total of 75 acres.
This Landscape Management Plan for Fort Smith, was undertaken by a multi disciplinary team which included a landscape architect, the park superintendent, an archaeologist, park ranger, maintenance chief, historian, and a natural resources specialist as well as other associated consultants.
It provides an action plan for the implementation of the landscape related elements of the General Management Plan/Development Concept Plan/Interpretive Plan (1978, revised 1981).
The Landscape Management Plan uses the historic data presented in the 1984 historic landscape study for the site.
The two goals of landscape management at Fort Smith are firstly, to enhance visitor understanding of the three historic periods and secondly, to complement historic resource integrity.
The objectives and rationale for each of these goals are outlined and the constraints to, and opportunities for landscape management are discussed.
Four graphic plans are included in the report and cover utilities, landform, vegetation, and site development and provide a visual presentation of the landscape management plan.
The major part of the text describes the implementation of the treatments proposed in the plan.
The treatments are described for four different areas: (i) the ground plane, (ii) the vertical plane, (iii) the cultural resources, (iv) the external features.
In addition visitor circulation and support needs, and operational needs are also discussed.
The final chapter of the report deals with the phasing of the projects.
The main elements of the plan are prioritized for action.

Wright, Robert D. and O'Gwynn, Claude H. Existing and Historic Bathhouse Row Landscape Study, Hot Springs NP, Arkansas.
1987.
15 pgs.
This Landscape Study of the Bathhouse Row describes the existing and historic landscape and makes recommendations for future landscaping requirements.
The research concentrates on the plant materials and is based on field survey and historical documentation.
A field survey was undertaken to identify the existing plant material on the site.
The location of individual specimens was mapped and a notation made of their size and condition.
An evaluation was also made of their potential suitability for transplantation.
The second section summarizes the historic landscape.
The research was based on primary sources which included 1890 and 1920 planting lists, a set of 1932 maps, historic photographs and descriptions, as well as secondary material.
Soil and planting recommendations are made and a list of species suitable for future landscaping proposed.
The species are based on those used in the landscapes of the 1890s and 1930s, and excludes species deemed inappropriate by virtue of size, lack of hardiness, short life span, and susceptibility to pests.
Separate recommendations for the planting and layout for nine subunits of the landscape are given: the Magnolia Promenade, the Bathhouse Lawns, the Main Entrance, Arlington Lawn, Display Springs, Transition Area, Grand Promenade, Open Lawn Bays, and Open Woods.

Landscape Management Plan, Bathhouse Row, Hot Springs NP. 1989.
140 pgs.
Hot Springs National Park is located in the Ouachita mountains of central Arkansas.
The 47 hot springs within the park occur as a result of complex natural geological processes.
The waters have been used for bathing and medicinal purposes throughout history.
It was developed as a spa resort in the late nineteenth century.
The area considered in this report includes the entire Bathhouse Row Historic District, which contains the original Bathhouses and is a national historic landmark.
The study area also includes the surrounding open lawns and woods.
Planning documents for Hot Springs National Park identified the need for a landscape management plan to guide future design and management of the landscape, especially in connection with the adaptive use leasing program.
This plan was undertaken by a team which included a landscape architect, historical architect and archaeologist.
It identifies specific goals and objectives for the historic designed landscape and develops design guidelines for planting, renovation and maintenance.
The first section of the landscape management plan gives a historical overview of the Bathhouse Row landscape and describes the history and current use of significant landscape elements, which together define the "spirit of the place".
An inventory of the existing landscape is made with the study area being divided into two main units, the Lawn Park unit and the Foreground Park Unit.
For the purposes of the discussion, the main units are further subdivided into discreet areas.
Within each sub unit a description is given of the existing landscape structure, main site features and current use.
The first section concludes by defining goals and objectives for landscape management:
Goal 1: Ensure that the spirit and integrity of the historic landscape continue into the future.
Goal 2: Enhance visitor experiences; enhance their enjoyment and understanding of the resources.
Goal 3: Through appropriate design, satisfy other important needs related to use of the study area.
Each of these goals is supported by objectives, which explain in more detail how the goals will be achieved.
The second section of the report sets out plans and action for the site.
Design guidelines are presented by subunit and for each deal with groundplane, vegetation, and site feature issues.
Existing problems and possible solutions are illustrated in sketches, these are, however, considered to be only guidelines not definitive treatments.
The types of design issues addressed include drainage, gradients, access for less abled, planting, renovation, removal of overgrown vegetation, lighting and site furniture.
A further chapter gives detailed recommendations and guidance on signage and current needs for interpretation.
The Appendices contain:
The Landscape management plan historic landscape inventory and compatibility assessment.
Vegetation maintenance guidelines.

Cultural Landscape Recommendations: Mission Concepcion, San Antonio Missions NHP. 1989.
49 pgs.
Mission ConcepciÃ¯Â¿Â½n forms a unit of the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, it is located approximately half a mile east of the confluence of the San Antonio River and San Pedro Creek, in Texas.
The site was selected in 1731 as the headquarters mission of the Querterans, part of the Spanish Franciscan Missionary movement.
The historic vernacular landscape of the Franciscan Mission comprised five elements: the church, convento, the Indian community (pueblo), farmlands surrounding the mission, and the ranchlands at some distance from the mission complex.
This report deals only with the first four elements.
Most of the land of the Mission ConcepciÃ¯Â¿Â½n is owned by the Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio and is managed by the Park through cooperative agreements.
This document provides a preliminary analysis and evaluation of the historic landscape.
It contains a database of information and sets the historic context for the site and makes recommendations and guidelines for the preservation and enhancement its landscape integrity.
The research was carried out by a multi-disciplinary team which included a landscape architect, historical architects, an historian and historical archaeologist.
It is intended that this preliminary report is followed by a more in-depth cultural landscape report.
The report begins with an identification of the site and defines contextual boundaries (physiographic, cultural and political) and site boundaries (vegetation, topographic, circulation and structures).
The history of the site is summarized and classified into eight distinct periods.
(i) First Contact 1720- 1731.
(ii) Initial Period 1731-1755.
(iii) Zenith 1755- 1786.
(iv) Secularization 1780-1824.
(v) Rural Period 1824 - 1890.
(vi) Urban Beginning Period 1890-1936.
(vii) Preservation and Restoration Period 1936-1978.
(viii) National Park Service Period 1975- present.
The landscape is analyzed and evaluated under the following headings: cultural traditions, land use, circulation, structural types, cluster arrangements, vegetation, archaeological sites, and small scale elements.
A visual analysis of the site is also included.
Mission ConcepciÃ¯Â¿Â½n was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1970 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, as part of a district nomination for the Park.
The site is considered to possess historic landscape significance on a national level according to National Register Criteria A, C, and D.
Criterion A - Mission ConcepciÃ¯Â¿Â½n is integrally linked with Spain's sixteenth century expansion into Texas and the southwest.
Criterion C - it embodies a distinct type of landscape organization and method of construction.
Criterion D - it yields important information about the Spanish colonial influence on broad settlement patterns and landscape organization in the San Antonio region of Texas.
Mission ConcepciÃ¯Â¿Â½n is considered to retain historic landscape integrity in the following areas: location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.
The report concludes with recommendations which provide an appropriate framework and programmatic basis for the preservation, maintenance and interpretation of the historic site.
These guidelines address issues surrounding stabilization and preservation of resources, removal of non historic components that compromise the historic scene, and enhancement or re establishment of historic features as part of a design program for the site as a whole.
The six program areas are: maintenance and management, buildings/structures and archaeological resources, circulation and access, plant materials, site details and materials and special site issues.

Cultural Landscape Recommendations, Mission San Jose, San Antonio Missions NHP (Draft).
1989.
59 pgs.
Mission San Jose is third in a chain of five missions along the San Antonio River running north from downtown San Antonio in Texas.
It was established in 1721 by Spanish Franciscan missionaries at a site on the west bank of the river, located above the floodplain.
The historic vernacular landscape comprises a church, convento, Indian community (pueblo), farmland surrounding the mission and an outlying ranch.
The Mission was laid out as a new village around an open plaza, and includes a designed garden containing plants for medicinal and culinary use.
The site was later fortified in response to the threat of Apache raiders.
Currently, Mission San Jose and all surrounding lands which make up this unit of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park are owned by the State of Texas and the Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio.
Park management is through cooperative agreements with these bodies.
This report provides a preliminary analysis of the historic landscape of the Mission.
A database of information is collected and the historic context of the site evaluated.
Recommendations and guidelines for preserving and enhancing the sites landscape integrity are formulated.
The study was based on fieldwork and research and was undertaken by a team which included a landscape architect, historical architects, an historian and historical architect.
The report begins with an identification of the site, which sets out contextual boundaries (physiographic, cultural and political). and site boundaries (vegetation, topographic, circulation and structures).
The history of the site is summarized and divided into six distinctive periods.
(i) Initial period 1721- 1765, establishment of the Mission.
(ii) Zenith period 1765-1824, fortification and rebuilding.
(iii) Rural Period 1824-1924, secularization of the mission with lands and buildings appraised and regranted to Indians and new owners.
(iv) Restoration Period 1924-1941, a county, state and federal works project was instigated by the San Antonio Conservation Society in 1924.
The restoration was overseen in the 1930s by the Civil Works Administration (CWA) and then the Works Project Administration (WPA). (v) State Management Period 1941-1978, transfer of the Mission to State supervision.
(vi) Federal Management Period 1978-present, Establishment of the San Antonio Mission National Historical Park, and management by the NPS.
An analysis and evaluation of the resource follows, and considers cultural traditions, archaeological sites, land uses, circulation, structural types, cluster arrangements, vegetation, small scale elements, a visual analysis is also included.
The significance of the site is evaluated.
The Mission has been designated a National Historic site (1941), National Historic +Landmark (1970) and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (1988).
The site is considered to be significant as representative of the Spanish colonial era and also for the 1930 WPA restoration.
It possesses historical landscape significance on a national level according to three National Register Criteria:
Criterion A - Mission San Jose is integrally linked with spain sixteenth century expansion into Texas and the southwest.
Criterion C - it embodies a distinct type of landscape organization as well as methods of construction characteristic of the Spanish colonial mission in Texas.
Criterion D - It has yielded and has a high potential to yield, valuable information about spanish colonial settlement patterns and landscape organization in the San antonio region of Texas.
Mission San Jose is considered to retain historic landscape integrity in the following areas: location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association.
Based on the analysis and evaluation of significant historic landscape features and components identified by this research, the report concludes with a series of recommendations.
They are intended to provide an appropriate framework and programmatic basis for the preservation, maintenance, and interpretation of the site.
They address issues regarding stabilization and preservation and encourage preservation of a number of the significant layers on the site, rather than the restoration of any one historical period.
The removal of non historic components is considered and recommendations are made for areas outside the sites boundary, where conditions are threatening the sites historic integrity.
Areas where new construction may be appropriate are designated.
Recommendations are divided into six program areas.
(i) maintenance and management concepts.
(ii) buildings, structure and archaeological resources.
(iii) circulation and access.
(iii) plant materials.
(iv) site details and materials.
(iv) special site issues.
The report is illustrated throughout with photographs, maps, sketches and drawings.

Cultural Landscape Recommendations, Mission Espada, San Antonio Missions NHP (Draft).
1990.
51 pgs.
Mission Espada was established in 1731 by Spanish Franciscan Missionaries.
It is one of four mission units comprising the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, Texas.
The land is managed through a combination of fees simple ownerships, cooperative agreements and scenic easements with a variety of local public and private interests.
Some land is also in private ownership.
The aim of this report is to undertake preliminary documentation and evaluation of the significant vernacular landscape resources of the Mission Espada and develop general recommendations for their preservation.
The study which was based on fieldwork and historical research was undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team which included a landscape architect, historical architect, historian, architectural historian and historical archaeologist.
The report begins with an identification of the site.
The physiographic, cultural and political boundaries are defined as are the vegetation, topographic, circulation and structural boundaries.
Three physically separate, but interrelated components are recognized as comprising the historic landscape of the mission complex: (i) the Acequia system, which includes the Espada Dam, the Espada Aqueduct, and the network of irrigation ditches. (ii) the Missions walled compound.
(ii) the associated labores - cultivated fields irrigated by the Acequia.
A fourth component - Rancho de las Cabras the missions' fortified ranching operations headquarters, located 25 miles south of the historic zone is also recognized.
These four primary historic landscape features are described in detail.
The second chapter of the report documents the history of the site.
The Initial Period 1731-1780, describes the establishment of the mission.
The Transitional Period 1780 - 1794, saw new settlers who were not Mission Indians coming to live in the Mission and use available farmland.
1794-1910 is described as the Rural Period and covers the time when the Mission was secularized.
The Church Management Period covered the time between 1910 - 1978, and finally from 1978 to the present the site has been managed by the NPS.
A description and analysis of the historical landscape focusses on the sites response to natural features, cultural traditions, land use, circulation, cluster arrangement, structural types, vegetation and archaeology and small scale elements in the landscape.
The chapter on significance states that the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park is on the National Register of Historical Places and the Espada Dam and Aqueduct are both designated as historic landmarks.
Of the four missions in the Park, Espada is the most intact, best preserved and most representative of the mission establishment of four individual but interrelated landscape components.
The acequia system, labores, ranch, and mission compound are still largely intact and working.
The statement of significance follows National Register Documentation and the site is considered to be significant under Criterion A, for its association with events that have made significant contributions to the broad patterns of history, Criterion C, for the distinctive characteristics of a type, method or period of construction and Criterion D, for the important historic information the site has yielded.
The integrity of the site is also discussed under the seven headings of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.
Based on the preliminary landscape analysis and evaluation of significant historic landscape features and components identified in this report, recommendations for Mission Espada are made.
They are intended to provide an appropriate framework and programmatic basis for the preservation, maintenance and interpretation of the historic site.
The recommendations are grouped into four main areas: (i) management and maintenance, (ii) buildings, structures and archaeological sites, (iii) circulation and access, (iv) site details and materials.
One of the recommendations is that a complete Cultural Landscape Report should be prepared for the site.
The study is amply illustrated throughout with drawings, sketches, maps and photographs.
