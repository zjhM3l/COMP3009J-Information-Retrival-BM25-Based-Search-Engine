The perceived diminishing of a "Native American threat" to white prosperity sometimes relegated Native Americans to little more than a novelty act.
For example, Thomas Edison's turn-of-the-century films such as Buffalo Dance, Sioux Ghost Dance, and the Sham Battle at the Pan-American Exposition documented traditional performances created for the interest and amusement of people attending an ethnic village in a World's Fair.
Meanwhile, materials such as the 1898 film, Indian Day School, and the 1923 map of Indian Reservations West of the Mississippi River documented the harsh new realities of Native American culture.
