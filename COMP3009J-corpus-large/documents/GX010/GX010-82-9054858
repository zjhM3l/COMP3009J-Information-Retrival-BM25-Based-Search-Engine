For Immediate Release STEPHEN C. ROBINSON--U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT
April 27, 1998
Mr. President, there are few issues as important as protecting our citizens and keeping our communities free of crime.
Americans should feel secure in their homes, at their schools, and in their neighborhoods, and in recent years we have made tremendous progress in this area, reducing the crime rate for a record five years in a row.
But more work needs to be done.
One of the most effective ways to make our streets safer is attracting talented and committed individuals to work in law enforcement.
That is why I am so pleased that my Senate colleagues have displayed great wisdom and unanimously confirmed Stephen C. Robinson to serve as U.S. Attorney for the State of Connecticut.
Mr. Robinson has extensive and varied law enforcement experience in the public sector and his legal and investigative work for the private sector well qualify him to serve in this position.
I was proud to recommend his nomination to the President, and I believe that he will bring a sense of intelligence, integrity, and energy to this office.
After graduating from Cornell University and Cornell Law School, Mr. Robinson was in private practice for several years.
He then became an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York where he directed the prosecution of narcotics cases and tax fraud and securities fraud cases.
He also argued appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit.
In 1990, Mr. Robinson received the Department of Justice's Director Award for Superior Performance as an Assistant U.S. Attorney.
Mr. Robinson also has served as Associate General Counsel and Managing Director at Kroll Associates, the world's largest private investigation firm.
In 1993, FBI Director Louis Freeh asked Mr. Robinson to join the Bureau as his Special Assistant and General Counsel.
At the FBI, he oversaw counter-terrorism and counter-espionage policy and investigation; revision of the selection and promotion process for Special Agents; and FBI undercover investigation proposals.
Mr. Robinson has most recently worked as Chief Compliance Officer for Aetna U.S. Healthcare in Middletown, Connecticut, and he is also an instructor of Trial Practice Law at Yale Law School.
Mr. Robinson's confirmation is particularly significant in Connecticut, because he is the first African-American to ever serve as our State's top federal prosecutor.
He has spoken publicly about the sense of hopelessness amongst young blacks throughout the country.
And having grown up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Mr. Robinson hopes that young people from inner cities will look at him and see someone who can not only relate to their circumstances, but who also illustrates that if you get your education and work hard you can attain your goals, regardless of where you come from.
Mr. Robinson stands as a positive role model for African-American youths, and in fact all young people.
By taking the post of Connecticut's U.S. Attorney, Mr. Robinson is renewing his connection to public service.
But this may have never been possible were it not for a conversation between Steve and his mother in 1996.
During the Thanksgiving holidays, his mother encouraged him to return to public service and give more back to his community.
Mr. Robinson has frequently stated that this conversation prompted him to reevaluate what he wanted to do with his life.
Upon reflection, he decided to take his mother's advice, and he decided that he should return to public service.
On behalf of the people of Connecticut, I would like to thank Steve's mother.
Steve Robinson is a man of outstanding character and intelligence, and we are fortunate to have him serve as our next U.S. Attorney.
I offer my sincere congratulations to Steve, his wife Kathleen Sullivan, his daughter Victoria, and all of his family and friends on his well-deserved confirmation.
I have every confidence that he will flourish in this position.
