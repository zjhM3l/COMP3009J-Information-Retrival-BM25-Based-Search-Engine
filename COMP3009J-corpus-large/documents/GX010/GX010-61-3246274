DECISION
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
THIS CASE AROSE PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL SERVICE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS STATUTE, 5 U.S.C. 7101 ET SEQ., (THE STATUTE), AS A RESULT OF CONSOLIDATED UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE COMPLAINT FILED BY THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR, SIXTH REGION, FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY, DALLAS, TEXAS, AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, AUSTIN DISTRICT, DALLAS DISTRICT, AND SOUTHWEST REGION (HEREINAFTER JOINTLY REFERRED TO AS RESPONDENT OR SEPARATELY AS IRS, AUSTIN DISTRICT, IRS, DALLAS DISTRICT, AND IRS, SOUTHWEST REGION).
THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED, IN SUBSTANCE, THAT RESPONDENT VIOLATED SECTIONS 7116(A)(1) AND (8) OF THE STATUTE BY REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 7131(A) IN REFUSING TO PROVIDE, VARIOUSLY, OFFICIAL TIME FOR TRAVEL AND TRAVEL AND PER DIEM EXPENSES FOR AGENCY EMPLOYEES REPRESENTING THE UNION AT NEGOTIATIONS.
RESPONDENT ADMITS JURISDICTION, BUT DENIES ANY VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE.
A HEARING WAS HELD IN THIS MATTER IN DALLAS, TEXAS.
BASED ON THE ENTIRE RECORD HEREIN, INCLUDING MY OBSERVATION OF THE WITNESSES AND THEIR DEMEANOR, THE EXHIBITS, STIPULATIONS, AND OTHER RELEVANT EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE HEARING, AND THE BRIEFS, I MAKE THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

RESPONDENT HAS REFUSED TO REIMBURSE ANTONIO OVALLE AND ARLIE SMITH OFFICIAL TIME FOR TRAVEL AND PER DIEM AND TRAVEL EXPENSES INCURRED IN REGARD TO THESE NEGOTIATIONS.
GENERAL
7.
RESPONDENT, THROUGH ITS AGENT ROBERT M. MCKEEVER, BY LETTER DATED JULY 11, 1980 NOTIFIED THE UNION THAT "(T)HE NTEU WAS FORMALLY NOTIFIED ON FEBRUARY 11, 1980 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE'S INTENT TO DENY PAYMENT OF TRAVEL AND PER DIEM FOR UNION OFFICIALS PARTICIPATING IN NEGOTIATIONS."
8.
THE UNION REIMBURSED THE ABOVE-NAMED EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR TRAVEL EXPENSES, AFTER RESPONDENT REFUSED TO DO SO, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE EMPLOYEES WOULD RETURN THIS MONEY TO THE UNION IF AND WHEN THE RESPONDENT IS REQUIRED TO PAY THE EMPLOYEES AFTER THESE PROCEEDINGS.
DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
THE ISSUE PRESENTED FOR DETERMINATION IS WHETHER RESPONDENT VIOLATED 5 U.S.C. 7131(A), THUS COMMITTING UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES IN VIOLATION OF 5 U.S.C. 7116(A)(1) AND (8), BY REFUSING TO PAY TRAVEL AND PER DIEM EXPENSES, AND BY REFUSING OFFICIAL TIME FOR TRAVEL, FOR AGENCY EMPLOYEES REPRESENTING THE UNION AT MID-TERM NEGOTIATIONS.
THE AUTHORITY IN ITS INTERPRETATION AND GUIDANCE, 2 FLRA NO. 31(1979) CONCLUDED THAT THE OFFICIAL TIME PROVISIONS OF SECTION 7131(A) ENCOMPASS ALL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE AND AN AGENCY OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, INCLUDING MID-TERM NEGOTIATIONS AS WELL AS THE NEGOTIATION OR RENEGOTIATION OF A BASIC COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.
THE AUTHORITY ALSO HELD THAT "WHILE AN EMPLOYEE IS ON OFFICIAL TIME REPRESENTING AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE NEGOTIATION OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, THAT EMPLOYEE IS ON PAID TIME ENTITLED TO HIS OR HER USUAL COMPENSATION AND IS NOT IN LEAVE STATUS."
THE AUTHORITY EXPRESSLY FOUND THAT AN EMPLOYEE SO ENGAGED "IS CLEARLY ENGAGED ON 'OFFICIAL BUSINESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT.'"
THE AUTHORITY CONCLUDED THAT "ANY EMPLOYEE WHO IS ON OFFICIAL TIME UNDER SECTION 7131 OF THE STATUTE WHILE REPRESENTING AN EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE NEGOTIATION OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS ENTITLED TO PAYMENTS FROM AGENCIES FOR THEIR DUTY TIME AND TRAVEL AND PER DIEM EXPENSE."
RESPONDENT CONTENDS THAT THE INTERPRETATION AND GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN 2 FLRA NO. 31 HAS NO SUPPORT IN THE CIVIL SERVICE REFORM ACT OF 1978, ITS LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, AND IS CONTRARY TO LONG ESTABLISHED PAST PRACTICES AND PRECEDENTS; THAT RESPONDENT IS WITHOUT LEGAL AUTHORITY TO EXPEND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF EMPLOYEE-UNION NEGOTIATORS TRAVEL AND PER DIEM EXPENSES; THAT OFFICIAL TIME DOES NOT COVER TRAVEL TO AND FROM BARGAINING SESSIONS; THAT, ALTHOUGH REQUESTS HAVE BEEN MADE AND DENIED, ACTUAL TRAVEL VOUCHERS HAVE NOT BEEN SUBMITTED BY ALL THE EMPLOYEES IN QUESTION; AND THAT WHERE AN EMPLOYEE HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID BY THE UNION FOR TRAVEL AND PER DIEM EXPENSES, SUCH EMPLOYEE HAS NOT INCURRED SUCH EXPENSES FOR PURPOSES OF REIMBURSEMENT.
MOST OF THE RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS ARE WITHOUT MERIT IN THIS FORUM FOR THE REASONS GIVEN BY THE AUTHORITY IN ITS INTERPRETATION AND GUIDANCE, SUPRA, AND MORE RECENTLY EXPRESSED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE, AND ADOPTED BY THE AUTHORITY, IN BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS, WESTERN REGION, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA AND NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION, CHAPTER 81, 4 FLRA NO. 40(1980).
RESPONDENTS' REMAINING CONTENTION, THAT THE AGENCY EMPLOYEES REPRESENTING THE UNION DID NOT INCUR EXPENSES SO AS TO JUSTIFY REIMBURSEMENT, IS EQUALLY WITHOUT MERIT.
THIS ARGUMENT IS GROUNDED ON THE STIPULATION BY THE UNION THAT IT REIMBURSED THE EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR TRAVEL EXPENSES, AFTER RESPONDENT REFUSED TO DO SO, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE EMPLOYEES WOULD RETURN THE MONEY TO THE UNION IF AND WHEN RESPONDENT PAID THEM FOR THEIR EXPENSES.
THIS PROCEDURE WILL NOT RESULT IN THE "DOUBLE REIMBURSEMENT" FEARED BY RESPONDENT.
THE UNION IS, IN EFFECT, MERELY LOANING OR ADVANCING THE EMPLOYEES FUNDS TO COVER THEIR EXPENSES UNTIL THE EMPLOYEES ARE PROPERLY REIMBURSED FOR SUCH EXPENSES BY RESPONDENT.
THE FACT THAT THE UNION UNDERTOOK TO ACCOMMODATE THE EMPLOYEES IN THIS MANNER IS IRRELEVANT TO RESPONDENT'S OBLIGATION.
INDEED, THE AUTHORITY NOTED IN ITS INTERPRETATION AND GUIDANCE, SUPRA, THAT THE REQUIREMENT THAT AGENCIES PAY TRAVEL AND PER DIEM EXPENSES WOULD MORE NEARLY EQUATE THE STATUS OF UNION AND MANAGEMENT NEGOTIATORS AS CONTEMPLATED BY CONGRESS, FACILITATE MORE EFFECTIVE UNION REPRESENTATION AT THE BARGAINING TABLE, AND THEREBY IMPLEMENT THE PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE, TO ENCOURAGE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE FEDERAL SECTOR.
ACCORDINGLY, I CONCLUDE THAT BY ITS FAILURE AND REFUSAL TO PROVIDE THE ABOVE NAMED UNION REPRESENTATIVES WITH OFFICIAL TIME FOR TRAVEL AS OCCURRED DURING THE EMPLOYEES' REGULAR WORK HOURS AND WHEN THE EMPLOYEES WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN IN A WORK OR PAID LEAVE STATUS AND WHATEVER TRAVEL AND PER DIEM EXPENSES THEY MAY HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO WERE THEY CONSIDERED TO BE ON OFFICIAL AGENCY BUSINESS WHILE PERFORMING THE UNION REPRESENTATIONAL DUTIES, RESPONDENT FAILED AND REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 7131(A) OF THE STATUTE AND THEREBY VIOLATED SECTIONS 7116(A)(1) AND (8) OF THE STATUTE.
BASED ON THE FOREGOING FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS, I RECOMMEND THAT THE AUTHORITY ISSUE THE FOLLOWING:

--------------- FOOTNOTES: ---------------
/1/ THE RESPONDENT CONTENDS THAT THE JUDGE ERRED IN EXCLUDING EVIDENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT TWO OF THE EMPLOYEES CLAIMING TRAVEL EXPENSES AND PER DIEM DID NOT SUBMIT VALID EXPENSE VOUCHERS IN SUPPORT THEREOF.
HOWEVER, NO FACTUAL ISSUE EXISTS AS TO THIS MATTER INASMUCH AS THE RECORD ESTABLISHES THAT ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED SOUGHT TRAVEL EXPENSES AND PER DIEM AND WERE INFORMED BY THE RESPONDENT THAT THEIR REQUESTS WERE DENIED.
FURTHER, THE GENERAL COUNSEL CONCEDED ON THE RECORD THAT TWO OF THE EMPLOYEES DID NOT SUBMIT VOUCHERS AFTER BEING ADVISED THAT SUCH VOUCHERS WOULD NOT BE HONORED.
IN ANY EVENT, IT IS NOTED IN THIS REGARD THAT THE JUDGE'S RECOMMENDED ORDER, ADOPTED HEREIN, REQUIRES THE RESPONDENT TO PAY WHATEVER TRAVEL AND PER DIEM EXPENSES MAY BE INVOLVED, BUT ONLY UPON SUBMISSION OF APPROPRIATE VOUCHERS.
THUS THE MATTER IS PROPERLY ONE FOR COMPLIANCE.
/2/ IN AGREEMENT WITH THE JUDGE, AND BASED ON HIS REASONING, THE AUTHORITY FINDS THAT THE CHARGING PARTY'S TEMPORARY REIMBURSEMENT OF THE EMPLOYEES FOR THE AMOUNT OF THEIR PER DIEM AND TRAVEL EXPENSES HAS NO BEARING ON THE RESPONDENT'S DUTY TO MAKE THEM WHOLE FOR THOSE AMOUNTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 7131(A) OF THE STATUTE AND THE AUTHORITY'S INTERPRETATION AND GUIDANCE, 2 FLRA 265(1979).
