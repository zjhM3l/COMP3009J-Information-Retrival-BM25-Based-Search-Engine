The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Hearing on Port Security __________________________________________________________________ TABLE OF CONTENTS(Click on Section) PURPOSE BACKGROUND WITNESSES __________________________________________________________________ PURPOSE The purpose of this hearing is to receive the recommendations of the Secretary of Transportation on the need to increase security in our nations ports and waterways against terrorist attacks.
The Subcommittee will discuss the Federal governments current maritime security efforts and the Administrations suggestions on ways to further reduce the vulnerability of our ports and waterways to terrorist attacks.
BACKGROUND
On September 24th, the bipartisan leadership of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee requested that the Secretary of Transportation establish a rapid response team to develop ways to reduce the vulnerability of our seaports to terrorist attacks.
Specifically, the Committee leadership asked the Secretary to provide suggestions for immediate action that may be necessary to improve seaport security.
Increased Coast Guard Security Measures Taken After September 11th
Since September 11th, the Coast Guard has increased its counterterrorism operations using existing personnel, vessels, and aircraft.
This increase in maritime security operations has reduced the Coast Guards capacity to perform other vital missions including counter-narcotics, migrant interdiction, and fisheries law enforcement activities.
Without additional resources, the Coast Guard will not be able to maintain this increased port security posture and perform other vital Coast Guard missions.
Immediately following the events of September 11th, the Coast Guard launched the largest homeland port security operation since World War II.
As part of Operation Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom, the Coast Guard heightened security by establishing port and coastline patrols with 55 cutters, 42 aircraft and hundreds of small boats.
Over 2,800 U.S. Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty to support maritime homeland security operations in 350 ports.
Four of the six Port Security Units, which are self-contained rapid response units trained primarily in port and waterway security, were used to help patrol the Ports of New York and New Jersey, Boston, Seattle, and Long Beach in the weeks immediately following the September attacks.
The Coast Guard enforced over 118 maritime security zones around navy vessels, cruise ships, nuclear power plants, and other potentially hazard facilities.
Currently, the U.S. Coast Guard is enforcing a wide range of security measures on all ships entering U.S. ports.
The Coast Guard has issued a temporary final rule changing the 24-hour Notice of Arrival requirement for ships entering U.S. ports to 96 hours before arrival at the first U.S. port.
New special rules apply for all vessels carrying dangerous cargoes and additional information is also required in the Advance Notice of Arrival.
The notice must now include a listing of all persons on board, crew and passengers, with date of birth, nationality, along with the appropriate passport or mariners document number.
The Notice must also include the vessel name, country of registry, call sign, official number, the registered owner of the vessel, the operator, the name of the classification society, a general description of the cargo, and date of departure from the last port along with that ports name.
The Coast Guard has created a pilot armed escort program, called the Sea Marshals program, in the Ports of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.
This program is designed to reduce the threat of using a commercial vessel as a terrorist instrument.
The Sea Marshal concept employs preventive measures to neutralize tactics that could be employed by terrorists attempting to gain control of a large commercial carrier.
The Sea Marshals armed escort provides security for the pilot, master, and the bridge navigation team on board a vessel during its transit in U.S. navigable waters.
According to the Coast Guard, further expansion of this program will depend on the availability of resources, as well as future port-specific security needs.
The Coast Guard has also established Naval Vessel Protection Zones for a distance of 500 yards around all U.S. naval vessels in the navigable waters of the United States.
These protection zones will remain in effect through June 15, 2002.
In addition, each Coast Guard Captain of the Port may employ any security measures that he deems necessary to ensure the safety and security of the port.
For example, the Coast Guard has required several facilities handling dangerous cargo to provide additional security personnel and other security improvements.
Facilities not addressing Coast Guard security concerns may have their operations suspended or be subjected to civil penalties.
Immediately following the September 11th attack, the Commandant directed Coast Guard Captains of the Ports to implement passenger vessel and passenger terminal security plans to the maximum extent possible at security level III.
Level III is implemented when the Commandant determines that the threat of an unlawful act against a vessel or terminal is probable or imminent and intelligence indicates that terrorists have chosen specific targets.
The Coast Guard is working closely with the operations and security personnel at the International Council of Cruise Lines which represents the bulk of large passenger vessels operating out of the United States.
Level III passenger vessel and terminal security measures require restricted areas around the vessel which are enclosed with fences or walls and protected by intrusion detection systems and patrols.
Other security measures include the screening of all baggage, cargo, and stores that are placed on the ship as well as the screening of passengers before they are allowed to board the ship.
Current Coast Guard Authorities
The U.S. Coast Guard currently has primary responsibility for the promotion of safety of life and property at sea, the enforcement of all applicable Federal laws on, under, and over the highs seas and United States waters.
The agency also is charged with protecting the marine environment, conducting icebreaking activities, maintaining aids to navigation, and securing the safety of vessels, ports, waterways, and their related facilities.
Section 89 of title 14, United States Code, authorizes the Coast Guard to board any vessel subject to the jurisdiction, or operation of any law, of the United States in order to make inquiries, examinations, inspections, searches, seizures, and arrests for the violations of U.S. laws.
The Coast Guard may order and force any vessel to stop and may engage in land, water, and air patrols.
Federal law also authorizes the Coast Guard to control the anchorage and movement of vessels in the navigable waters of the U.S. in order to ensure the safety and security of U.S. naval vessels.
The Ports and Waterway Safety Act (PWSA) provides the Secretary of Transportation with broad authority to regulate the movement and operation of a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
Coast Guard Captains of the Port may order vessels to operate as directed, to anchor, as well as require pre-arrival notices.
The PWSA also authorizes the Secretary to respond to acts of terrorism against vessels and waterfront facilities and to investigate any incident that causes damage to a waterfront facility or affects the safety of a U.S. port.
The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to refuse or revoke a vessels clearance when it may be liable to the U.S. for violation of the PWSA.
During times when the President determines that national security is endangered, the Coast Guard may seize any vessel that fails to follow its directions within U.S. territorial waters.
Under the above conditions, the Coast Guard may also fine or imprison the master and crew for noncompliance with its orders as well as establish a Port Security Card Program.
This program provides for the controlled access to waterfront facilities and vessels by individuals with an appropriate security background screening by the Commandant.
When certain conditions exist, the Captain of the Port may be directed by the Commandant to establish a restricted waterfront area and prevent access of persons who do not hold a Port Security Card.
The Coast Guard required Port Security Cards at various facilities from 1942 until the end of the Vietnam War.
Federal law authorizes the Coast Guard to regulate the handling of dangerous cargo at waterfront facilities, the use of dangerous cargos on inspected vessels, and the carriage of certain specified liquid bulk cargoes by vessels.
The Secretary of Treasury, at the request of the Secretary of Transportation, may refuse or revoke the clearance to enter a port of the United States when he believes a vessel carrying liquid bulk dangerous cargo or other hazardous materials has violated U.S. law.
Vessels carrying dangerous cargoes are built and inspected to Coast Guard standards.
Coast Guard marine inspectors conduct annual inspections to ensure these vessels meet and maintain these standards and make unannounced boardings to monitor transfers of dangerous cargos.
In 1985, a U.S. citizen was killed during the terrorist seizure of the passenger vessel ACHILLE LAURO.
In response to the vulnerability of passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals to acts of terrorism, Congress enacted the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.
Title XI of this law constitutes the International Maritime and Port Security Act and authorizes the Coast Guard to require measures, including inspections, port and harbor patrols, the establishment of security and safety zones, and the development of contingency plans and procedures, to prevent or respond to acts of terrorism.
The law also requires that passenger vessels and passenger terminal operators develop a plan of action for implementation of security measures at the ports and passenger vessels operating from those ports.
The Coast Guard must examine and approve the security plans for passenger vessels and terminals and provide oversight to ensure that the plans are being properly implemented.
Passenger vessels are only allowed to embark from or disembark to terminals that hold an examined Terminal Security Plan.
Federal law further requires the Secretary to conduct foreign port vulnerability assessments for passenger vessels should he find U.S. citizen passengers to be at a high risk of acts of terrorism directed against passenger vessels.
The law also requires the issuance of travel advisories and authorizes the President to suspend certain passenger voyages for security reasons.
This law does not apply to cargo vessels and terminals.
Foreign port assessments are coordinated with the Department of State and the cruise ship industry.
This program has been perennially underfunded and only two assessments were completed last year.
Coast Guard Resource Requirements
Prior to September 11th, the Coast Guard suffered from significant funding shortfalls.
During fiscal years 2000 and 2001, the Coast Guard was forced to reduce law enforcement operations by up to 30 percent due to insufficient funds.
Both the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution and the House passed Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2001 (H.R. 1699) increased Coast Guard funding levels by $250-$300 million respectively to correct ongoing critical funding shortfalls.
These funding shortfalls are similar to those experienced by the Department of Defense, including spare parts shortages and personnel training deficits.
.
In addition, since resources from other missions, such as counter-narcotics, migrant interdiction, and fisheries law enforcement operations have been shifted to homeland security activities, the Coast Guard has been forced to make a significant reduction in these traditional missions.
Coast Guard assets are now concentrated in and around U.S. ports instead of patrolling the Caribbean Sea or Gulf of Mexico to intercept illegal drugs or migrants.
The Coast Guard has estimated there has been about a 25 percent reduction in drug interdiction and an even greater reduction of fisheries law enforcement since September 11th.
In response to the terrorist attacks, Congress passed a $40 billion emergency supplemental appropriation to combat terrorism.
The Coast Guard received $18 million to cover operating expenses in New York Harbor and for Coast Guard Reserve activations.
The President requested an additional $203 million for the next 6 months for the Coast Guard to activate reservists, increase its homeland security operations, and provide for three nuclear and biological detection strike teams.
Division B of H.R. 3338, the Fiscal Year 2002 Supplemental Appropriation, contains approximately $145 million in supplemental funding to cover additional Coast Guard homeland security costs.
