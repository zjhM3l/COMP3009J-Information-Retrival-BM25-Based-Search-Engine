TEKTRAN _________________________________________________________________ RESISTANCE TO THE BANDED SUNFLOWER MOTH (LEPIDOPTERA: COCHYLIDAE) FROM COMPONENTS IN SUNFLOWER SEED, FLORETS, RAY FLOWERS AND LEAVES Author(s): BARKER JOHN F Interpretive Summary:
Two moth species, the banded sunflower moth and the sunflower moth are pests of cultivated sunflower.
The life styles of both moth species are similar.
The immature stages of both moths feed on the flower parts and the seeds of the sunflower head.
Experiments have been conducted with the sunflower moth that indicated some floral parts of the sunflower head contained materials that caused the immature stages of the moth to die before reaching maturity.
Evidence that such materials are present in a crop plant may be useful in developing control procedures for pest insects.
Therefore, it seemed instructive to see if the same floral parts or another part of the sunflower caused death of the immature stages of the banded sunflower moth.
It was found that sunflower seed contained a chemical component that increased mortality of banded sunflower moths.
Floral parts did not have the deleterious effect on the banded sunflower moth that was seen with the sunflower moth.
The differences in response of two competing insect species probably reflected distinct adaptations to their cultivated sunflower host.
Since sunflower seed contained materials with harmful effects on the banded sunflower moth, selection of sunflower plants that produced seed with increased activity against the banded sunflower moth could be useful for developing greater control of this pest insect.
