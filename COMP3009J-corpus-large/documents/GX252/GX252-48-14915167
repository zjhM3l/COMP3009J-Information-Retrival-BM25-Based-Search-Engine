How to Use This Guide The lessons in this guide introduce students to Census 2000 with high-interest, grade-level appropriate activities designed to meet your curricular needs.
Students will learn what a census is and why it's important to them, their families, and the community.
Lesson planning at a glance Your Scope and Sequence (on the inside front cover) provides an at-a-glance summary of the lessons in this book.
These lessons are designed to support your classroom goals, and are divided into three learning strands: Map Literacy, Community Involvement, and Managing Data.
The Scope and Sequence identifies skills, objectives, national standards, and curriculum areas for each lesson.
Map, computer, and library icons allow you to quickly see which lessons interface with the We Count! wall map, and those that offer special enhancements using Internet and library resources.
Each lesson in this guide consists of a teacher lesson plan and two reproducible activity pages.
Because students in grades 5-8 have attained different degrees of mastery, the lessons in each strand have been stepped (one lesson aimed at grades 5-6; one lesson aimed at grades 7-8), allowing you to tailor your teaching to the individual needs of your students.

Before you begin
Extension Activities Many lesson plan pages contain one or more Extension Activities designed to enhance students' experience and understanding of the census beyond the classroom.
These activities often make use of the vast stores of information available at the official U.S. Census Bureau Web site (see below) and will make it possible to incorporate updated Census 2000 information into lessons.
Using the Web site The U.S. Census Bureau Web site (www.census.gov) is easy to use and can provide students and teachers with a wide variety of information on characteristics of the U.S. population.
For example: Starting on the home page, click on "Estimates" under the box labeled "People."
In this category, choose "States."
Students can work with the data found on screen or the data can be printed out for easier use.
In addition, teachers can access the lessons from all three Census 2000 Teaching Guides (K-4, 5-8, and 9-12) on the Census Bureau Web site.
The Census 2000 questionnaire may also be viewed on this site.

Getting Started:
1.
Begin this lesson by telling students they will practice reading two kinds of special purpose maps: a Mean Center of Population map (on page 8 of this guide) and a Population Density map (inset in the We Count! wall map). q A Mean Center of Population map is a useful tool in assessing population shifts.
Reasons for these shifts include historical movements, such as westward expansion, as well as economic trends.
q The Population Density map shows where people in the U.S. live, county by county.
Students can use the map key to determine how densely populated particular counties are.

q Northeastern states have the highest
2.
To help students understand what the mean center of population is, try this demonstration: q Tape 3 paper clips on each end of a letter-size
population density.
Help students see the correlation between this fact and how the region appears on the Population Density map. q Have students refer to their school library's
envelope.
Balance the envelope on your fingertip.
Demonstrate the balance point to the class.
q Then move 2 paper clips from one side of the envelope to the other, so that one side has 5 clips and the other has one.
Demonstrate how the balance point shifts.
q Explain that the mean center of population is the point at which the United States would balance perfectly if it were a flat surface (like the envelope) and every person weighed the same amount (as the paper clips do). q Be sure students know which area of the U.S. the map on page 8 shows.

Lesson 2
Activity Worksheet Name: __________________________________________
Where We Live A lot of the information the census collects is shown on special purpose maps.
Special purpose maps are maps that show information about a specific subject, such as a country's annual rainfall or milk consumption.
Two special purpose maps the U.S. Census Bureau uses are a Population Density map and a Mean Center of Population map.
Population Density Map The We Count! wall map shows the population totals for each state.
But, the Population Density map shows how that population is distributed in each state.
Look at the Population Density map (in a separate box on the We Count! wall map.)
This map shows the population density, or how many people there are per square mile for each county in the United States.
Different densities are shown as different colors.
The map key tells you what each color represents.
Use this map to answer the following questions.
1.
How many people per square mile do the red counties have?
2.
Which two states appear to be the most densely populated? 3.
Look at your state.
What is the population density of the most densely populated part?
What is the population density of the least densely populated part?
4.
Which region of the country seems most densely populated: the Northeast, the Midwest, the South, or the West?

Mean Center of Population As the U.S. has grown from 13 to 50 states, the number of people living in different parts of the country has also changed.
The Mean Center of Population map shows the point at which the country would balance perfectly if it were a flat surface and every person on it were of equal weight.
Mean Center of Population
Look at the Mean Center of Population map above.
Use it to answer the questions below.
1.
In what state was the center of population located in 1790? in 1890? in 1990?

If one state's population increases while another state's decreases, the first state could gain a representative in Congress while the second state could lose one.
This reassignment of congressional seats based on changes in state population is called reapportionment.
Voting districts can also be changed based on census data.
The principle of "one person, one vote" requires that congressional and state districts have approximately equal population totals.

Filling in the census form is important because it's like filling in the future.
Consider these census facts: q The census count determines how many Congressional representatives your state gets. q Information from the census helps state and local governments decide where new roads, parks, schools, and other services are needed.
q Businesses use census data to help locate their factories and stores.
By law, all the information collected in the census is kept confidential.
To help people understand the importance of completing and returning their census forms, the U.S. Census Bureau has created a slogan for Census 2000: "This is Your Future.

MAKING PLANS Grades 7-8
Skills and Objectives: q Students will use real-life problem-solving skills to choose a site for a new school.
Suggested Groupings: Small groups, individuals ments serve their constituents.
If necessary, give an example, such as using census information on languages spoken in the home as a guideline for hiring bilingual workers at social service agencies.
Getting Started:
Chalkboard Definitions census tracts: small, relatively permanent subdivisions of counties that generally have 2,500 to 8,000 residents.
Tract boundaries usually remain the same from census to census, allowing people to compare data from several censuses.
1.
Ask students how they think census information is used.
Explain that federal, tribal, state, and local governments, and businesses use census information on age, gender, language, housing, employment, income, and transportation to tailor services to a community's needs.
This information is an integral part of urban planning decisions.
Census data are often organized by census tracts (see "Chalkboard Definitions" box).
Using Activity Worksheets: q Distribute copies of the Lesson
4 Activity Worksheets (pages 13 and 14) to the class and introduce students to the lesson.

At this meeting, add a cost consideration to the selection process.
Propose to students that it will cost twice as much to build a school on Site B, as it will to build on Site A or C. Building a school on Site B would mean raising taxes.
Ask students to rethink their site selection with this in mind.
Would their decision remain the same? Why or why not?
Extension Activity: Have groups brainstorm for other planning decisions that could be made from the data in this lesson, for example: a new playground or children's hospital.

Lesson 4
Activity Worksheet Name: __________________________________________
Making Plans One way that census data are gathered and organized is by census tracts.
Census tracts are small areas within counties that generally have between 2,500 and 8,000 residents, averaging 4,000 per tract.
Local governments can use tract statistics to make decisions, such as which areas could use a new bus route, or which neighborhoods need more playgrounds.
What if you were a local government official? How would you use census-style data to make plans? Give it a try.
A local school district has to decide where to build a new middle school/junior high school.
The planning chart below helps you analyze each site.
Use the School Planning Map and the Census Table on page 14 to fill in the chart below and choose the best site for the new school.
For each factor on the chart, rank the sites from 1 (best) to 3 (worst).
Explain your reasoning for the ranks you choose.
Then add up the rankings for each site to see which one comes out with the lowest total.
That's your site!
Planning Chart FACTORS TO CONSIDER SITE A SITE B SITE C REASONING
School-Age Populations Schools should be located near areas where lots of kids live.
Which sites are near tracts with large school-age populations?
Existing Schools Should schools be close together, or spread out among areas with lots of children? Industrial Areas Factories can cause noise and air pollution.
How might this affect a school?
Transportation How will kids get to school? Are there roads leading to the site, or will the community have to build new ones? Is it dangerous to put a school near a large highway?

Lesson 5
Activity Worksheet Name: __________________________________________
Create Your Own Form The U.S. Census Bureau will use the data gathered in Census 2000 to develop statistics that tell us more about our country.
Some of the statistics the U.S. Census Bureau might use are: mean (or average), mode, range, and median.
The Census Facts box (right) gives you two of these statistics.
Read the Census Facts box.
Then work with your group to develop your own census-style statistics.
Follow the directions below.
CENSUS FACTS q The mean (or average) number of people in a U.S. household was 2.63 in 1990.
q The median age of people in the United States in 1990 was 33.
MEAN The mean is the average of all the numbers in a set of numbers.
Follow these steps to find the mean number of people in your group's households:
1.
Write down the number of people in your household on a card.
Have a group member collect the cards and list all the numbers.
2.
Add all the numbers, then divide the sum by the number of addends.
(In this case, the total number of households in your group.)
If necessary, round your answer to the hundredths place.
This number is the mean number of people per household for your group.
3.
Write the mean here: 4.
Compare this mean to the national mean listed above.
Is the mean for your group higher or lower than the national mean from the 1990 Census?
MODE The mode is the number that occurs most often in a group of numbers.
There can be more than one mode.
Find the mode of the ages of household members in your group.
Here's how:
1.
Write down the age of each person in your household on a separate index card.
2.
Have a group member collect the cards and sort them by age.

Create Your Own Form RANGE
(continued)
Range is the difference between the greatest number and the least number in a set of numbers.
Find the range of age for household members in your group.
Here's how:
1.
Take the age index cards you used for finding the mode, and order them from least to greatest.
2.
What is the youngest age? 3.
What is the oldest age? 4.
Subtract answer 2 from answer 3.
This is your range.
5.
Write your range here.
MEDIAN The median is the middle number in a set of numbers.
If there is an even number of numbers, the median is the mean of the two middle numbers.
To figure out the median age of people in your group's household, follow these steps:
Median = 8

Managing Data
GRAPH IT! Grades 7-8
Skills and Objectives: q Students will practice calculating percentages.
q Students will determine measures of central angles.
q Students will display information in a circle graph.
Suggested Groupings: Small- to medium-sized groups
Chalkboard Definitions circle graph (pie chart): a graph that is used to show the relationship of parts to a whole.
percent: the ratio of a number to 100.
Like a fraction, a percent signifies a part of a whole.
Materials: Protractors, calculators (optional) Getting Started:
1.
Begin this lesson by providing students with some information about the U.S. Census.
Did they know that the United States collects more varied and complete census information than any other country? The Census Bureau gathers information from households about population and housing, including questions about age, race, and education.
Once census data are collected, statistics are used to compile this information in a more meaningful way so it can be shared with agencies, businesses, universities, and the public.
Information such as age distribution of a population is crucial because it impacts government programs and spending.
For example, if the percentage of U.S. citizens ages 65 and over increases between 1990 and 2000, this might affect the allocation of funds to social security and programs for the elderly.
2.
Distribute one copy of the worksheet on page 20 to each group and introduce them to this activity.
q Guide students through the steps for creating sections of the circle graph.
Make sure students understand how to calculate central angles.
If necessary, have a volunteer demonstrate how to use a protractor.
Wrapping Up: q Have students compare their completed tables and circle graphs. q What if the number in each age group was doubled? Would its percentage of the total change? (no) Would its angle in the circle graph change? (no) q If the class requires additional practice, have them determine how many students have last names that start with A-H, I-Q, or R-Z. Calculate each number as a percentage of the class.
Have students create circle graphs to display these percentages.
2.
Explain to students that they will be calculating percentages to complete a table and then use the table to create a graph.
To prepare for the activity, ask students to write the ages of their household members on a piece of paper.
If students completed Lesson 5, they will already have this information.
Extension Activities:
Using the Activity Worksheets:
1.
Divide class into groups (no less than 6 students each) and distribute one copy of the Activity Worksheet on page 19 to each group.
Introduce them to the activity and remind them that they will need the information about the ages of their household members to complete it. q After students have completed the table, review the answers so they can correct their data before performing the graphing activity.
1.
Have students visit the library or the U.S. Census Bureau Web site (www.census.gov) to research a table of census information for their city or county.
Have them create a circle graph to display percentage data for one statistic.
2.
Students can use household population data collected from Lesson 5 or from the Census Bureau Web site to create computer spreadsheets, using graphing features in spreadsheet or database software.
Answers: Worksheet answers will vary.

Lesson 6
Activity Worksheets Name: __________________________________________
Graph It! Collecting data is a big part of the U.S. Census Bureau's work, but displaying that information in a useful way is also important.
The Census Bureau and other data users convert numbers into percents and display those percents in tables and graphs.
One graph that shows percents is a circle graph, or pie chart.
For example, the circle graph at right shows household age-group percents for Mr. Stilwell's 7th Grade Class.
Example: Household Population by Age Group of Mr. Stilwell's 7th Grade Class Ages 65 and over Ages 0-5
17% Ages 51-64
12% Ages 6-20
15%
21%
Ages 21-50
35%
CALCULATING PERCENT Using the information each member in your group wrote down about the ages of members of their household, determine what part of your group's total household population each age group represents.
First, add up your group's totals in each age group, then follow these 3 steps:
Step 1: Divide the population for the age group by the total population.
(Use a calculator.)
Example: 136 (population for age group) Ã· 1200 (total population) = .11333333333
Step 2: Round the decimal to the hundredth place.
Example: .11333333333 becomes .11
Step 3: Multiply by 100.
Add the % sign.
Example: .11 becomes 11%
Now find the percent of the total population for each of your group's age groups.

Lesson 6
Activity Worksheet (continued) Name: __________________________________________
Graph It! Now you can display the percents you calculated about your group's household ages in a circle graph.
Here's how to do it:
(continued)
1.
Begin with the percent for each group.
Use your percent figures from page 19 to fill in the percent column in the table below.
2.
Calculate the measure of the central angle for each age group.
Remember, a circle has 360Â°.
For example: If the percent for age group 0-5 is 11%, then 11% of 360Â° = 0.11 x 360Â° = 39.6Â° If you are using a calculator, percent can be calculated by 360Â° x 11, followed by the % sign.
Population by Age Group Circle Graph
3.
Now complete the circle graph for your group.
Place your protractor on the graph so that the black dot in the middle of the circle lines up with protractor.
For the 0-5 Age Group, use your protractor to the circle graph.
For each succeeding group, reorient your of the last line drawn is now the 0Â° line.
Label each section the 0Â° indicator on the indicate the angle measure on protractor so that the endpoint and your circle graph is complete.
