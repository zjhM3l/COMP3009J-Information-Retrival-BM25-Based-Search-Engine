**Data not reported due to small numbers of students.
The Austin Magnet Committee Report (December 1998), said that there are concerns that the current magnet model (school-within-a-school) has a "negative impact on the delivery of effective curricula to the non-magnet students in the host schools."
The committee report states, "The current magnet model serves to mask the academic difficulties of non-magnet students."
Using accountability standards for the 1998-99 school year, TAAS scores for these schools reinforce these concerns.
The committee believes that disclosing the performance of non-magnet students would bring attention and possible state and federal financial resources to help improve the performance of non-magnet students at these campuses.
Recommendation 36:
Evaluate the educational and economic impact of magnet programs on host campuses.
Use comparative magnet/non-magnet test scores, course selection and other indicators to identify and focus services on students in host schools who are not succeeding academically.
To address all students' needs, school and district staff must have information that provides information on the performance of all students in a school.
Teachers, campus administrators, parents and community members should have access to this information to make appropriate instructional decisions.

FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
There is no clear evidence that the district's approach for teaching gifted and talented children is effective.
Texas state law requires all school districts to identify and provide services for gifted and talented students.
In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.
This plan is a guide on how to meet the law's requirements.
In 1996, the State Board of Education (SBOE) updated the plan to incorporate Texas Education Code Section 29.123 requirements.
The updated plan forms the basis of program accountability for state-mandated services for gifted and talented students.
AISD's Office of Advanced Academic Services defines gifted and talented students as students who are advanced intellectually and academically.
Their gifts may be apparent in one or more subjects, like English, math, science and social studies, or in their ability to learn rapidly.
In many cases, a regular or honors curriculum cannot meet the needs of gifted and talented students.
According to the coordinator of Advanced Academic Services, the district does not meet the program standards recommended in the State Plan.
Compliance varies from school to school.
Some principals could describe the process of gifted and talented student identification and list the services provided for these students.
Others, however, said there was no effort made to provide services for these students.
Several principals, teachers and central administration staff said AISD's gifted and talented educational program was weak and in many instances non-existent.
Bilingual teachers and district administrators said there are no specific efforts to identify gifted bilingual education students.
Campus and district staff said that even though it is recommended in the State Plan, there is no identification process for science and social studies; gifted students in those core subjects are not identified.
Interviews with campus teachers involved in gifted education and with members of the Austin Association of Gifted and Talented Education indicated that, while the Office of Advanced Academic Services' responsibilities include coordinating several programs for high achieving students, the office does not have adequate resources to fulfill its responsibilities.
Overall, AISD is not complying with the state plan for gifted and talented students.
State law requires teachers of gifted and talented students to receive 30 hours of instruction in teaching gifted and talented students.
The format in which gifted and talented services are delivered to students is a campus decision.
All teachers in the district are encouraged to receive training.
Training all teachers, with the current district turnover rate, however, is a difficult task.
Even if a teacher is trained, that teacher may or may not be teaching gifted children.
Teachers told TSPR that most do not have enough time to provide appropriate services to gifted students.
Although training may improve a teacher's instructional methods, it does not ensure that properly trained teachers will be teaching gifted students.
Program staff, parents and community association members noted that AISD does not have a district-level accountability system in place for assessing the quality of the gifted and talented program.
Staff and parents said that the district is now implementing its own gifted and talented plan, and that this plan is still in draft form.
The agenda published for the Office of Program Evaluation for the 1999-2000 school year, however, does not include any plans for evaluating gifted and talented education in this district.
The assistant director of the Department of Accountability said that the gifted and talented educational program has not been evaluated in at least five years.
Recommendation 37:
Implement the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The Office of Program Evaluation and the Office of Academic Studies evaluate the effectiveness of the district's gifted and talented education program.
August 2000 -February 2001 2.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services determines if every campus in the district is implementing the recommendations in the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.
January 2001 3.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services develops measures to ensure that every campus follows the State Plan.
March 2001- August 2001 4.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services uses the State Plan to develop an accountability system for gifted and talented programs in AISD.
March 2001 -December 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
Several district and campus-level staff, in addition to members of the Austin Area Association of Gifted and Talented Education said how the district manages its information on its gifted and talented education program does not help teachers and principals to identify gifted and talented students on their own campuses.
Most high school teachers do not know who their gifted students are.
One principal, for instance, said, "We don't know if anything is accurate...Sally may be identified as gifted and talented on three different campuses."
Another high school principal said, "I cannot obtain a list of students on my campus that are gifted and talented; if it is available, it is extremely difficult to obtain."
The assistant director of the Office of Research and Evaluation said that AISD does not have a code in the student master file that allows administrative staff to track gifted students.
Although the data may be available, it is in different files and not easily accessible.
The current information system does not provide administrators with information to improve services for gifted students, nor does it help in the decision-making process.

Source: 1997-99 TEA AEIS Reports.
As shown in Exhibit 2-34, compared to the peer districts, AISD had the second highest number of students identified as gifted, yet the number and percentage of teachers assigned to gifted programs was the lowest.
This number, however, does not accurately represent the number of teachers teaching gifted students in AISD.
The interim coordinator for Advanced Academic Services said that the number of teachers reported in the AEIS report is incorrect.
She said that for the 1999-2000 school year, the correct number of certified gifted and talented teachers is 1,642.
This number is significantly higher than the number of teachers reported in the AEIS reports for the peer districts.
Both the interim coordinator for Advanced Academic Services, and an administrative assistant in TEA's Office of Advanced Academic Services said that the number of teachers reported in the AEIS report could vary considerably depending on the type of instructional delivery.
In AISD, gifted instruction is provided through the regular classroom, and because all teachers are encouraged to become certified, it is expected that the number of certified gifted teachers would be high.
This number, however, does not provide any information on how much time regular classroom gifted and talented certified teachers allocate to gifted and talented instruction.
Recommendation 38:
Establish a system to accurately identify, track and report the number of gifted students and certified gifted and talented teachers involved in teaching gifted students.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The Office of Academic Studies coordinates with the district data management system staff to add a field to the student database so gifted students are identified and the information is accessible to approved campus staff.
August 2000 -February 2001 2.
Review number and percentage of teachers allocated to gifted and talented education reported to TEA and report a number that accurately reflects the number of teachers in gifted and talented education.
August 2000 -February 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
In AISD, there is no evidence how gifted and talented funds are used to meet the needs of gifted students.
The coordinator of Advanced Academic Services and members of the Austin Area Gifted and Talented Education Association said that is impossible to track expenses for gifted education, in part, because the budget process does not include line-item descriptions of allocations for the gifted.
Because of this problem, it is not known if the expenditures for gifted and talented education indicated in the AEIS reports are correct.
Exhibit 2-35 AISD Expenditures for Gifted and Talented Programs AISD vs. Peer Districts 1998-99
District Students Budgeted G/T Expenditures Percent of Budgeted Expenditure Per Student Expenditure Forth Worth 4,617 $8,274,301 3.8% $1,792 Northside 5,234 $2,657,130 1.4% $508 Alief 3,160 $1,646,103 1.3% $521 Corpus Christi 1,752 $557,976 0.5% $318 Austin 6,010 $473,346 0.2% $79 Pasadena 1,964 $262,785 0.2% $134
Source 1998-99 TEA AEIS Reports.
Exhibit 2-35 shows AISD's expenditures for gifted and talented education.
For the 1998-99 school year, AISD ranked second to last among its peer districts on spending for gifted and talented education.
Peer districts with similar numbers of identified gifted and talented students (more than 5,000) spent significantly more on gifted education.
Budget allocations for gifted and talented education comprised 0.2 percent of the budgeted expenditures, also amongst the lowest compared to the peer districts.
Compared to the peer districts, AISD ranked lowest in the per student expenditures for gifted education.
According to TEA's Division of Advanced Academic Services, AISD received approximately $1 million in state Gifted and Talented funds for the 1998-99; and for 1999-2000, according to TEA's Division of State Funding, the district received $1,161,118.
According to the AEIS report, AISD budgeted less than half of the funds that it received for gifted and talented education.
The district has known about this reporting problem since at least 1996.
To remedy this problem, the district's Comprehensive Plan (preliminary recommendations, April 19, 1996) states that "Beginning in 1996-97 and annually thereafter, the AISD administration will produce an annual report of the distribution of all funds targeted for gifted and talented education which clearly identifies how these funds were allocated for expenditure."
The annual report has not been produced.
Members of the Austin Area Gifted and Talented Association have requested copies of this report, but the district has not provided the association with the report.
Recommendation 39:
Annually report the distribution of funds allocated to gifted and talented education.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The Budget Director and staff in the Office of Advanced Academic Services produce an annual report showing how all funds targeted for gifted and talented education were actually spent.
May 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
AISD requires teachers to modify the regular curriculum to meet the individual needs of each gifted student.
The coordinator for Advanced Academic Services said that AISD does not have a grade-level, appropriate curriculum for gifted and talented education.
Several parents expressed concern over the quality of the instruction that was considered gifted and talented.
Likewise, several teachers expressed concern about their ability to meet their students' needs.
Members of the PTA Council said there should be a defined gifted and talented program curriculum for different subjects and for each grade.
They stressed this curriculum or lack thereof should not depend on the school or the teacher.
Recommendation 40:
Develop gifted and talented curriculum guides by grade level and content.
This will require the district to extend the contracts of four gifted and talented certified teachers during the summer months for four years to complete this task.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The Department of Human Resources extends the contracts of four gifted and talented certified teachers, two for the elementary grades and two for secondary level.
May 2000 - May 2002 2.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services works with these teachers to develop gifted and talented curriculum guides for every grade level and every content area.
June 2000-August 2002 3.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services distributes curriculum guides.
August 2000- August 2002 4.
The assistant director of the Office of Program Evaluation surveys teachers to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the curriculum guides.
June 2000 Ongoing 5.
The superintendent funds the summer gifted and talented curriculum development program until all guides have been completed.
June 2000 - Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
Four teachers will have their contracts extended for approximately two months or 42 working days.
The average daily rate for teachers in AISD is $196.94, for a total of $33,086 in teacher salaries ($196.94 x 42 days x 4 teachers).
Benefits for the extended contracts will be $4,612 (($5,133/187 days) x 42 days x 4 teachers), for a total cost of $37,698.
Recommendation 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 Develop gifted and talented curriculum guides by grade level and content.

These three schools combined accept approximately 1000 students every school year.
Currently, the district is planning to open a second junior high magnet program at Fulmore Middle School in the 2000-01 school year.
Magnet schools provide a challenging and innovative educational environment for qualified middle and high school students.
The main goal is academic acceleration and excellence, with an emphasis on independent study and learning.
These programs prepare students for higher-level educational opportunities.
AISD students may apply to these programs by completing an application form that considers grades, ITBS scores, teacher evaluation and a personal essay.
Usually, students must score at or above the 70th percentile on an achievement test and have grades of 80 or above.
Teachers and parents interviewed said that magnet programs are places where teachers can observe exemplary practices, and new, successful approaches to instructional delivery.
Among the various programs and activities, one finds a rich variety of course offerings and an active involvement with area colleges, universities and local businesses.
This involvement offers internship programs for both AISD and university students and brings expert speakers and tutors from various educational fields.
Students from every campus are encouraged to apply.
Program directors make efforts to increase participation from schools with high minority student enrollment.
Kealing Junior High School recruits from every sixth grade in the district.
The school has a partnership with the University of Texas at Austin and with Ortega, Zavala, TA Brown, Walnut Creek, Barrington and Pecan Springs Elementary Schools to participate in a Young Scientists program that identifies and prepares students in the district's predominately minority schools for Kealing Magnet Program.
In one elementary, a science teacher from Kealing works one period every other day with the grade 6 teachers.
At LBJ High School, the class of 1999 (120 students) included: 14 National Merit Scholars, 17 National Merit Semifinalists, 17 National Merit Commended Scholars, 2 National Achievement Scholarships for Outstanding Negro Students and 5 National Hispanic Scholarships.
The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was administered to 120 students.
The average verbal score was 613, and the average mathematics score was 636.
At Kealing Junior High, approximately 60 students received state recognition in the Duke Talent Search.
COMMENDATION
Through the three magnet schools, AISD has done an outstanding job providing opportunities for students to explore in depth, advanced, challenging curricula in science, mathematics, technology and liberal arts.
FINDING
AISD's magnet program is challenging and exemplary, and many parents have urged the district to expand magnet programs to include other curricula.
Seventy-two percent of community members responding to a survey said AISD should expand its magnet school offerings to include additional programs like engineering and fine arts.
Community members also said that they would like the district's high school magnet programs to have their own campus.
AISD magnet programs function as a "school within a school," with one segment of the student body enrolled in the magnet program.
Interviews with program directors, teachers, principals and community members demonstrate an uncertainty over whether the original intended effect of housing magnet programs in campuses that educate high percentages of economically disadvantaged students helps the host school, or if they create an antagonistic, resentful relationship between magnet and non-magnet student and teacher groups.
AISD's first magnet program, the Science Academy at LBJ High School, was established in 1985 with magnet directors reporting directly to the assistant superintendent for Secondary Education.
The original intent was to create a program that would have sufficient autonomy to allow program directors to develop innovative instructional programs.
When the Liberal Arts program was established in Johnston High School in 1987, magnet directors began reporting to the school principal.
Magnet program directors still report directly to the school principal, although area superintendents also routinely call upon them.
Directors said that many times they are reporting to two people, and that they are not evaluated regularly, or by the same person from year to year.
In Kealing Junior High School, magnet students make up two-thirds of the school.
In this case, the magnet director is responsible for two-thirds of the school, yet must report to the school principal.
Several issues that should be left up to the magnet director's discretion, like budget decisions, teacher evaluations and when to hire teachers, must be approved by the school principal.
Magnet directors and principals said their relationship is strained, and at times has led to resentment and distrust.
Magnet directors are often called on to help the school principal perform duties that are completely unrelated to their jobs as magnet program directors.
Reagan High School's facilities have been significantly underused for years and operate at only 59 percent capacity.
Underused facilities are costly, wasteful, and a drain on a district's resources.
Reagan High School, located near the intersection of Interstate 35 and US Highway 290 in Austin's preferred growth corridor, is centrally located and accessible from surrounding Central Texas communities.
The facility has both large permanent classroom capacity and ample parking.
Kealing Middle School, with a capacity of 1,176 students, has a 1999-2000 enrollment of 958, with approximately 600 magnet students.
The district's magnet school at Kealing serves only 7th and 8th grade students; prospective magnet students completing elementary school must attend 6th grade at another campus before enrolling at Kealing.
The Kealing magnet director and parents of magnet students agree that the Kealing magnet program needs to be open to 6th graders.Magnet directors and community members also said that middle school magnet offerings should be expanded and that magnet schools need their own campuses
.
Recommendation 35:
Locate a new Regional Magnet Campus at the Reagan High School and make Kealing Middle School a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight.
The Science Academy at LBJ High School and the Liberal Arts Academy at Johnston High School should be relocated to the Reagan campus.
Reagan High School would become a Regional Magnet Campus, open to students from AISD and other Central Texas school districts.
The Regional Magnet Campus should offer advanced programs in science and liberal arts, develop new magnet programs such as a fine arts academy, and establish a technology academy for students who wish to develop the skills that will make them employable in the Austin economy.
The district should bring together representatives from Austin's high tech, business, and higher education communities to provide resources toward making the Reagan Regional Magnet Campus the educational crown jewel of Central Texas.
The magnet schools at LBJ and Johnston high schools currently serve 1,100 students (774 in the Science Academy and 326 in the Liberal Arts Academy).
The capacity of Reagan High School means that it initially could accommodate at least 1,500 magnet students while also housing AISD central administrative staff.
(TSPR recommends that AISD relocate its central office to the Reagan High School Facility.
See Chapter 1, District Organization and Management.)
Creating an AISD Middle School Magnet Campus will enable the district to better meet the needs of its qualified middle school magnet students.
Kealing Middle School should be a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight with expanded magnet program offerings.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
Superintendent designates an area superintendent to whom magnet directors will report.
June 2000 2.
The superintendent directs the deputy superintendents to develop a plan for converting Reagan High School into a Regional Magnet Campus, housing a Science Academy, a Liberal Arts Academy and a Technology Academy and for converting Kealing Middle School into the district's Middle School Magnet Campus.
July 2000 3.
The superintendent and the executive cabinet redraw attendance zones so that students who would currently track to Reagan High School and Kealing Middle School will track to other high schools and middle schools.
March 2001 4.
The superintendent presents the magnet campus plan and redrawn attendance zones to the board for approval.
August 2001 5.
The board approves the plan.
September 2001 and Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing staff and facilities.
Magnet staff will follow students to the new Reagan Magnet at an estimated cost of $300,000 relocation and renovation expenses for the Science Academy and $200,000 for the Liberal Arts Academy.
Transportation costs should not change significantly as students will need to be transported to two instead of three district magnet campuses.
Recommendation 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 Locate a new Regional Magnet Campus at the Reagan High School facility and make Kealing Middle School a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight.

FINDING
AISD does not regularly report student information separately, such as TAAS and ITBS scores or the percentage of students taking the SAT, for students enrolled in magnet programs and for students enrolled in the regular program on the same campus.
If this information is available at the district office, it is not fully disseminated to parents or the community at large.
In interviews and focus groups, teachers, principals, parents and community members said that without this information, the real performance of non-magnet students is masked.
TEA does not require districts to provide magnet vs. non-magnet program information, and accountability ratings do not reflect magnet program participation.
Teachers, principals and parents said that schools that host magnet programs would be seriously at-risk of receiving a low-performance accountability rating if the magnet programs were not housed at these schools.
Exhibit 2-30 shows the percentage of students attending magnet schools and the percentage of students not attending magnet schools who passed the TAAS in 1996-97 and 1998-99.
The data show that there is a large performance gap between students at magnet schools and students at non-magnet schools.
For non-magnet students, less than 50 percent passed the mathematics test, except for Kealing Junior High School in 1998-99.
Exhibits 2-31, 2-32 and 2-33 present TAAS, math, reading and writing scores for 1998-99.

The Austin Magnet Committee Report (December 1998), said that there are concerns that the current magnet model (school-within-a-school) has a "negative impact on the delivery of effective curricula to the non-magnet students in the host schools."
The committee report states, "The current magnet model serves to mask the academic difficulties of non-magnet students."
Using accountability standards for the 1998-99 school year, TAAS scores for these schools reinforce these concerns.
The committee believes that disclosing the performance of non-magnet students would bring attention and possible state and federal financial resources to help improve the performance of non-magnet students at these campuses.
Recommendation 36:
Evaluate the educational and economic impact of magnet programs on host campuses.
Use comparative magnet/non-magnet test scores, course selection and other indicators to identify and focus services on students in host schools who are not succeeding academically.
To address all students' needs, school and district staff must have information that provides information on the performance of all students in a school.
Teachers, campus administrators, parents and community members should have access to this information to make appropriate instructional decisions.

FINDING
There is no clear evidence that the district's approach for teaching gifted and talented children is effective.
Texas state law requires all school districts to identify and provide services for gifted and talented students.
In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.
This plan is a guide on how to meet the law's requirements.
In 1996, the State Board of Education (SBOE) updated the plan to incorporate Texas Education Code Section 29.123 requirements.
The updated plan forms the basis of program accountability for state-mandated services for gifted and talented students.
AISD's Office of Advanced Academic Services defines gifted and talented students as students who are advanced intellectually and academically.
Their gifts may be apparent in one or more subjects, like English, math, science and social studies, or in their ability to learn rapidly.
In many cases, a regular or honors curriculum cannot meet the needs of gifted and talented students.
According to the coordinator of Advanced Academic Services, the district does not meet the program standards recommended in the State Plan.
Compliance varies from school to school.
Some principals could describe the process of gifted and talented student identification and list the services provided for these students.
Others, however, said there was no effort made to provide services for these students.
Several principals, teachers and central administration staff said AISD's gifted and talented educational program was weak and in many instances non-existent.
Bilingual teachers and district administrators said there are no specific efforts to identify gifted bilingual education students.
Campus and district staff said that even though it is recommended in the State Plan, there is no identification process for science and social studies; gifted students in those core subjects are not identified.
Interviews with campus teachers involved in gifted education and with members of the Austin Association of Gifted and Talented Education indicated that, while the Office of Advanced Academic Services' responsibilities include coordinating several programs for high achieving students, the office does not have adequate resources to fulfill its responsibilities.
Overall, AISD is not complying with the state plan for gifted and talented students.
State law requires teachers of gifted and talented students to receive 30 hours of instruction in teaching gifted and talented students.
The format in which gifted and talented services are delivered to students is a campus decision.
All teachers in the district are encouraged to receive training.
Training all teachers, with the current district turnover rate, however, is a difficult task.
Even if a teacher is trained, that teacher may or may not be teaching gifted children.
Teachers told TSPR that most do not have enough time to provide appropriate services to gifted students.
Although training may improve a teacher's instructional methods, it does not ensure that properly trained teachers will be teaching gifted students.
Program staff, parents and community association members noted that AISD does not have a district-level accountability system in place for assessing the quality of the gifted and talented program.
Staff and parents said that the district is now implementing its own gifted and talented plan, and that this plan is still in draft form.
The agenda published for the Office of Program Evaluation for the 1999-2000 school year, however, does not include any plans for evaluating gifted and talented education in this district.
The assistant director of the Department of Accountability said that the gifted and talented educational program has not been evaluated in at least five years.
Recommendation 37:
Implement the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The Office of Program Evaluation and the Office of Academic Studies evaluate the effectiveness of the district's gifted and talented education program.
August 2000 -February 2001 2.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services determines if every campus in the district is implementing the recommendations in the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.
January 2001 3.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services develops measures to ensure that every campus follows the State Plan.
March 2001- August 2001 4.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services uses the State Plan to develop an accountability system for gifted and talented programs in AISD.
March 2001 -December 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
Several district and campus-level staff, in addition to members of the Austin Area Association of Gifted and Talented Education said how the district manages its information on its gifted and talented education program does not help teachers and principals to identify gifted and talented students on their own campuses.
Most high school teachers do not know who their gifted students are.
One principal, for instance, said, "We don't know if anything is accurate...Sally may be identified as gifted and talented on three different campuses."
Another high school principal said, "I cannot obtain a list of students on my campus that are gifted and talented; if it is available, it is extremely difficult to obtain."
The assistant director of the Office of Research and Evaluation said that AISD does not have a code in the student master file that allows administrative staff to track gifted students.
Although the data may be available, it is in different files and not easily accessible.
The current information system does not provide administrators with information to improve services for gifted students, nor does it help in the decision-making process.

Source: 1997-99 TEA AEIS Reports.
As shown in Exhibit 2-34, compared to the peer districts, AISD had the second highest number of students identified as gifted, yet the number and percentage of teachers assigned to gifted programs was the lowest.
This number, however, does not accurately represent the number of teachers teaching gifted students in AISD.
The interim coordinator for Advanced Academic Services said that the number of teachers reported in the AEIS report is incorrect.
She said that for the 1999-2000 school year, the correct number of certified gifted and talented teachers is 1,642.
This number is significantly higher than the number of teachers reported in the AEIS reports for the peer districts.
Both the interim coordinator for Advanced Academic Services, and an administrative assistant in TEA's Office of Advanced Academic Services said that the number of teachers reported in the AEIS report could vary considerably depending on the type of instructional delivery.
In AISD, gifted instruction is provided through the regular classroom, and because all teachers are encouraged to become certified, it is expected that the number of certified gifted teachers would be high.
This number, however, does not provide any information on how much time regular classroom gifted and talented certified teachers allocate to gifted and talented instruction.
Recommendation 38:
Establish a system to accurately identify, track and report the number of gifted students and certified gifted and talented teachers involved in teaching gifted students.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The Office of Academic Studies coordinates with the district data management system staff to add a field to the student database so gifted students are identified and the information is accessible to approved campus staff.
August 2000 -February 2001 2.
Review number and percentage of teachers allocated to gifted and talented education reported to TEA and report a number that accurately reflects the number of teachers in gifted and talented education.
August 2000 -February 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
In AISD, there is no evidence how gifted and talented funds are used to meet the needs of gifted students.
The coordinator of Advanced Academic Services and members of the Austin Area Gifted and Talented Education Association said that is impossible to track expenses for gifted education, in part, because the budget process does not include line-item descriptions of allocations for the gifted.
Because of this problem, it is not known if the expenditures for gifted and talented education indicated in the AEIS reports are correct.

District Students Budgeted G/T Expenditures Percent of Budgeted Expenditure Per Student Expenditure Forth Worth 4,617 $8,274,301 3.8% $1,792 Northside 5,234 $2,657,130 1.4% $508 Alief 3,160 $1,646,103 1.3% $521 Corpus Christi 1,752 $557,976 0.5% $318 Austin 6,010 $473,346 0.2% $79 Pasadena 1,964 $262,785 0.2% $134
Source 1998-99 TEA AEIS Reports.
Exhibit 2-35 shows AISD's expenditures for gifted and talented education.
For the 1998-99 school year, AISD ranked second to last among its peer districts on spending for gifted and talented education.
Peer districts with similar numbers of identified gifted and talented students (more than 5,000) spent significantly more on gifted education.
Budget allocations for gifted and talented education comprised 0.2 percent of the budgeted expenditures, also amongst the lowest compared to the peer districts.
Compared to the peer districts, AISD ranked lowest in the per student expenditures for gifted education.
According to TEA's Division of Advanced Academic Services, AISD received approximately $1 million in state Gifted and Talented funds for the 1998-99; and for 1999-2000, according to TEA's Division of State Funding, the district received $1,161,118.
According to the AEIS report, AISD budgeted less than half of the funds that it received for gifted and talented education.
The district has known about this reporting problem since at least 1996.
To remedy this problem, the district's Comprehensive Plan (preliminary recommendations, April 19, 1996) states that "Beginning in 1996-97 and annually thereafter, the AISD administration will produce an annual report of the distribution of all funds targeted for gifted and talented education which clearly identifies how these funds were allocated for expenditure."
The annual report has not been produced.
Members of the Austin Area Gifted and Talented Association have requested copies of this report, but the district has not provided the association with the report.
Recommendation 39:
Annually report the distribution of funds allocated to gifted and talented education.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The Budget Director and staff in the Office of Advanced Academic Services produce an annual report showing how all funds targeted for gifted and talented education were actually spent.
May 2001
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
AISD requires teachers to modify the regular curriculum to meet the individual needs of each gifted student.
The coordinator for Advanced Academic Services said that AISD does not have a grade-level, appropriate curriculum for gifted and talented education.
Several parents expressed concern over the quality of the instruction that was considered gifted and talented.
Likewise, several teachers expressed concern about their ability to meet their students' needs.
Members of the PTA Council said there should be a defined gifted and talented program curriculum for different subjects and for each grade.
They stressed this curriculum or lack thereof should not depend on the school or the teacher.
Recommendation 40:
Develop gifted and talented curriculum guides by grade level and content.
This will require the district to extend the contracts of four gifted and talented certified teachers during the summer months for four years to complete this task.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The Department of Human Resources extends the contracts of four gifted and talented certified teachers, two for the elementary grades and two for secondary level.
May 2000 - May 2002 2.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services works with these teachers to develop gifted and talented curriculum guides for every grade level and every content area.
June 2000-August 2002 3.
The Office of Advanced Academic Services distributes curriculum guides.
August 2000- August 2002 4.
The assistant director of the Office of Program Evaluation surveys teachers to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the curriculum guides.
June 2000 Ongoing 5.
The superintendent funds the summer gifted and talented curriculum development program until all guides have been completed.
June 2000 - Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
Four teachers will have their contracts extended for approximately two months or 42 working days.
The average daily rate for teachers in AISD is $196.94, for a total of $33,086 in teacher salaries ($196.94 x 42 days x 4 teachers).
Benefits for the extended contracts will be $4,612 (($5,133/187 days) x 42 days x 4 teachers), for a total cost of $37,698.
Recommendation 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 Develop gifted and talented curriculum guides by grade level and content.
