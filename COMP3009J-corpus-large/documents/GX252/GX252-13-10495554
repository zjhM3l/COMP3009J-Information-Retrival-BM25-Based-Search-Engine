CAP PAMPHLET 201 (E) 15 January 2000 CIVIL AIR PATROL SENIOR MEMBER TRAINING PROGRAM SPECIALTY TRACK STUDY GUIDE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER Foreword In order for Civil Air Patrol, or any nonprofit organization, to survive and grow, it must rely on the good will and understanding of the public.
The public affairs program includes those activities designed to tell the CAP story to both the public and CAP members, as well as how CAP fits into the local community.
Public affairs could very well be explained as covering tomorrow's history today.
While every CAP member is charged with responsibility as a public affairs representative, appointed public affairs officers carry the additional responsibility of official spokesperson for the unit and commander.
The Public Affairs Officer Specialty Track Study Guide is for individuals to use in progressing from the entry level of technician to the intermediate level of senior and the highest rating of master.
The technician level provides the individual with basic information to use in performing duty as a public affairs officer at unit level.
The senior level prepares the public affairs officer to serve as a functional public affairs officer and also in an expanded role as an advisor to the commander.
The master level provides for a person to advance to the highest level by gaining extensive knowledge of all phases of the public affairs program.
The public affairs officer will then be qualified to serve in any capacity within the public affairs program throughout Civil Air Patrol.
