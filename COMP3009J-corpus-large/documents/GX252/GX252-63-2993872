FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation could be implemented using existing resources.
Career and Technology Education (CATE)
Career and technology education (CATE) programsare designed toprepare students for the workplace.
Section 29.181 of the Texas Education Code requires school districts to provide a curriculum that affords each student the opportunity to "master the basic skills and knowledge necessary for managing the dual roles of family member and wage earner; gaining entry-level employment in a high-skill, high-wage job or continuing the student's education at the post-secondary level."
The Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 74, Subchapter A requires school districts to offer career technology education courses in at least three of eight areas: agricultural science and technology, business, health science technology, home economics, technology/industrial technology, marketing, trade and industrial and career orientation.
FINDING
The CATE program is not preparing students for careers in computer and technology.
The course offerings in this area are limited to keyboarding and word processing applications.
The program emphasizes agricultural science and includes a few business courses serving approximately 85 students.
SPISD's high school students each have a computer with Internet access in their homes.
The district is able to offer this resource through a USDA grant.
While students have ample access to computers, the district lacks the classes to build expertise in computer technology.
Students would benefit from classes such as Web site design, desktop publishing, computer programming and repair and database design and management.
Exhibit 2-18 lists SPISD's course offerings.

Santa Gertrudis ISD, a small school district with less than 300 students, has developed a strong instructional technology program.
High school students can enroll in a four-year career/technology program that begins with basic computer application and graphic skills and culminates with experience in business management and entrepreneurship.
As seniors, students work in the production, marketing, sales and service of computers.
Effective CATE programs maximize school resources and coordinate their course offerings with area colleges and businesses to optimize their training and employment opportunities.
Recommendation 14:
Expand the CATE program to include computer and technology courses that will prepare students for careers or continued education.
The director of Curriculum/Technology explores opportunities to expand the CATE program to include new computer classes.
The district should seek aid from Region 1 for staff development in teaching computer technology courses.

Library Program
The 1995 Legislature rewrote all of the state's public education laws, returning a great deal of authority to local school districts.
Legislation affecting school libraries was changed to read as follows:
The Texas State Library and Archives Commission, in consultation with the State Board of Education, shall adopt standards for school library services.
A school district shall consider the standards in developing, implementing of expanding library services.
(Texas Education Code 33.021).
Texas School Libraries, a study prepared for the Texas State Library and Archives Commission in 2001 found that 10 percent more students at schools with librarians met the minimum TAAS requirements in reading than in schools without librarians.
While socio-economic variables account for the greatest difference in TAAS reading scores across the state, the variance associated with the presence of a librarian on campus is significant.
At the high school level, the library variable accounted for 8.2 percent of the variance in TAAS reading scores.
In general, library variables were more predictive of TAAS reading scores than the number of school computers per student, teacher experience and teacher turnover.
FINDING
While the library has excellent computer equipment and offers access to the Internet, it has an inadequate book collection and does not meet state-recommended standards.
In addition, the district does not have a certified librarian.
Local district policy EFB states that the district shall provide and maintain a library media program as an integral part of the district's instructional resources.
The district's library located in the high school facility, serves 264 students in grades pre-K through 12, in 2001-02.
It is staffed by a library aide who is working to complete a bachelor's degree and has 8.5 years of experience in public libraries.
In interviews with the library aide, he stated that his primary goal for this school year was to have the library system fully automated by December 2001.
Once the system was automated, he would be able to better assess the library's needs and begin updating its collection.
At the time of TSPR's review, the district had no inventory of its book collection, which the librarian estimated at about 7,000 outdated books.
Of these, the library aide estimated 5,000 to be elementary level.
In addition, the library's research resources formiddle and high school students are grossly inadequate.Each classroom visits the library once a week but, due to its limited collection, students spend more time in the library being tested or working on computers than on reading.
The library aide said one of his goals is to get the students to enjoy reading but that this is difficult to accomplish given the poor selection of reading material.
The district's student achievement improvement plan found in the DIP lists the library as a resource for improving high school student performance.
The strategy is to encourage high school students to participate in the Accelerated Reader Program; however, there is little to entice high school readers in the Accelerated Reader book collection.
The library aide stated he has had difficulty in getting students to select books from the secondary accelerated reader collection.
SPISD students also do not have a community library to supplement the district collection.
The closest public library is in Raymondville, about nine miles from San Perlita.
In May 1997, the Texas State Library and Archives Commission adopted a series of recommended standards published as School Library Program Standards: Guidelines and Standards.
The goal of the school library program outlined in the Guidelines and Standards is to ensure that students and staff alike become effective users of ideas and information and literate, life-long learners.
To accomplish this task, the library program should provide instruction in research and the evaluation of resources, individual guidance and access to materials in multiple formats.
To assist districts, the guidelines offer criteria that identify library programs as exemplary, recognized, acceptable or below standard in the areas of the library learning environment, curriculum integration, resources, library program management and facilities.
Many small districts explore various ways such as grant funding to access needed funds for improving their library programs.
The American Association of School Libraries (ALA) offers internet resource guides on collection development and grant sources.
The ALA Web site is www.ala.org.
Another Web site that compiles a list of federal, state and foundation grants targeted for schools is www.schoolgrants.org.
This site allows the user to search by area of interest, type of grant or area.
The Texas Library Connection, a free service from TEA provides online resources equivalent to $32,000 of printed materials.
Other districts increase the services they provide students through partnerships with governments, community agencies or other school districts.
SPISD already shares a Spanish teacher with Lyford ISD and has partnered with the City of San Perlita for playground facilities.
Recommendation 15:
Update and expand the library's book collection to meet state recommended "acceptable" standards.
The district should bring the district library up to "acceptable" standards as defined in the School Library Program Standards: Guidelines and Standards, by first focusing on upgrading its library book collection.
The district should explore funding opportunities by applying for grants to assist them in the needed library upgrades and should match 50 percent of those funds.
The district contracts for its grant writing function.
In addition the district should consider forming a partnership with the city that might result in transforming the San Perlita ISD library into a community library.
The city could be responsible for hiring a certified librarian and additional staff, while the district would provide the facilities and material resources.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The superintendent instructs the district's library aide to identify grant opportunities to begin upgrading the library's book collection.
April 2002 2.
The superintendent seeks approval from the board to contract with the grant writer.
May 2002 3.
The board approves the grant writer.
May 2002 4.
The grant writer is contracted with and begins to write grants.
August 2002 5.
The superintendent seeks approval from the board to match 50 percent of grant monies obtained for library upgrades.
January 2003 6.
The superintendent explores forming partnerships with the City of San Perlita to consider making the school library a community library, sharing expenses.
June 2003 7.
The board approves the 50 percent funding match.
June 2003 8.
The library aide purchases 500 new books.
July 2003
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation assumes that the district would match 50 percent of the costs of upgrading the library's book collection.
The district would use the first year, 2002-03, to identify and apply for grants.
To purchase 500 new books at $18 per copy will cost a total of $9,000 (500 books x $18 = $9,000).
Half of these funds ($4,500) are assumed will come from grants and half from district funds.
The district would pay the contract grant writer $275 a day x 2.5 days or approximately $700 per grant.
Costs are estimated with the assumption that the grant writer would be contracted to write five grants the initial year.
In the first year, the grant writer would be paid from general funds.
In subsequent years the grant funds should be able to pay for the cost of the grant writer.
Recommendation 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 The district contracts for a grant writer.

Health and Wellness Services
FINDING
Despite its limited resources, SPISD offers comprehensive health services to its students.
SPISD employs one licensed vocational nurse to serve 264 students in the district for 2001-02.
The nurse maintains health and student immunization records, stores medical release forms in case of a medical emergency and dispenses medication in accordance with proper policies and procedures.
All health records are locked in a drawer to protect students' identities.
The nurse also provides vision, hearing and spinal screening once a year.
The nurse also conducts home visits when students have been absent for more than two consecutive days.
On November 28, 2001, San Perlita ISD offered free dental screening to all students with cooperation from Su Clinica, a local community clinic.
Permission forms were sent to parents in English and Spanish and returned by November 16, 2001.
The screening made parents aware of any potential dental problems.
COMMENDATION
The nurse provides outstanding health services to students.
Special Education
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires districts to provide free and appropriate public education for all children with disabilities regardless of the severity of their disability.
The law requires, moreover, that this education be provided in the "least restrictive environment."
Students with disabilities must be included in state and district assessment programs.
IDEA also requires school districts to develop an individualized education program (IEP) for each child receiving special education services.
The IEP is expected to include input from regular education teachers and to be coordinated with the education plans for students in regular education.
IDEA recommends that the following practices be implemented to effectively serve students with disabilities: 1.
Pre-referral intervention in regular education.
When a student experiences an academic problem in the regular education program, intervention should occur.
If steps taken by the regular education teacher do not support satisfactory results, the problem(s) should be referred to special education staff.
2.
Referral to special education for evaluation.
Referring a student to special education means writing an official request with supported documentation.
The referral information must include an explanation of steps that have been taken in regular education to solve the problem prior to referral.
3.
Comprehensive nondiscriminatory evaluation.
Once a student has been referred to special education, the district must provide a comprehensive nondiscriminatory evaluation or assessment within a prescribed amount of time.
4.
Initial placement through an Admission, Review, and Dismissal (ARD) committee.
After the assessment is complete, a meeting is held to discuss the results and determine if the student qualifies for special educational services in one of 13 categories.
If the student qualifies, an IEP plan is written for the student's education.
5.
Provision of educational services and supports according to a written Individualized Education Program (IEP).
The ARD committee develops an IEP, which includes information regarding the classes, subject areas, development areas, and life skills courses in which the student will be instructed.
The IEP also includes information regarding the amount time the student will spend in regular education as well as related needs like counseling, guidance, or speech therapy.
6.
Annual program review.
Each year after a student's initial qualification and placement, an ARD committee conducts a review to ensure the student's IEP is appropriate.
7.
Three-year re-evaluation.
Every three years, the student undergoes a comprehensive individual assessment and another ARD committee meeting is held to discuss the results of the re-evaluation.
This evaluation will identify if the student still qualifies for special education services in the same category.
8.
Dismissal from the special education program.
If and when a student no longer meets the criteria for eligibility, the student is dismissed from special education.
The ARD committee is responsible for making this decision.
SPISD's Special Education program has a pre-referral intervention process in place.
Students who have difficulty learning in the classroom are referred to an Instructional Intervention Team composed of the district's principals, the counselor, nurse, classroom teacher and a parent.
The team reviews the referral packets and develops plans to attempt to resolve concerns in the regular classroom setting.
The plans include specific strategies for teachers to use in an effort to meet the student's needs in the least restrictive environment.
Students who continue to perform below grade-level academic standards are referred for Special Education services.

FINDING
SPISD is a member of the WIL-CAM Pupil Services Cooperative for special education programs.
The WIL-CAM cooperative includes Lasara, Lyford, San Perlita, Santa Rosa, Raymondville and Rio Hondo.
The cooperative operates under local district policies and WIL-CAM cooperative managing board policies.
The six superintendents of the school districts served by WIL-CAM are members of the managing board and manage the cooperative in compliance with federal and state laws.
Each school district contributes funding each year for the operation of the cooperative.
In return, the school districts avoid the need to contract for additional personnel to meet serve special education students.
WIL-CAM is staffed by 12 employees and is housed at Raymondville ISD.
The staff includes the director of special services, an instructional supervisor, head educational diagnostician, various diagnosticians, counselors, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist and a speech therapist.
The services offered to participating school districts are: * directorship of the special education program * supervision of special education teachers * diagnostician testing * counseling * physical therapy * occupational therapy * speech therapy; and * medical exams for students
Participation in WILCAM is a cost-effective way for the district to offer these services.
COMMENDATION
SPISD participates in a special education cooperative that provides services and personnel for special education students.

Bilingual Education/English As A Second Language (ESL)
Texas Education Code Chapter 29 requires that school districts with an enrollment of at least 20 limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in the same grade offer a bilingual or English as a Second Language (ESL) program.
LEP students are those whose primary language is other than English and who lack the English-language skills to succeed in the regular academic environment.
The law specifies that bilingual education must be provided in the pre-kindergarten through the elementary grades and that bilingual education, instruction in ESL, or other transitional language instruction approved by TEA must be provided in post-elementary grades through grade 8.
For students in grades 9 through 12, only ESL instruction is required.
Bilingual education uses both the student's native language and English for instructional purposes.
The amount of instruction in each language is commensurate with students' proficiency in both languages and their level of academic achievement.
Content-area instruction, such as math, science, and social studies, is provided in both languages.
Students in K-2 receive most instruction in their native language, with a designated time for ESL instruction.
As a general rule, transition into English instruction takes place in the third grade.
ESL instruction is designed to develop proficiency in the comprehension, speaking, reading, and composition of both oral and written English.
Depending on the student's language ability levels, the amount of time allotted to English-language instruction may vary from total immersion to instruction in the regular program in elementary, and from one to two periods in grades 6-12.
Parents may waive Bilingual/ESL instruction.
Students on waived status receive no modifications and must take the TAAS test in the year in which they enroll.
SPISD administers an oral language proficiency test to students who have a language other than English stated on the home language survey.
Students in Pre-K through 12 are tested in their home language.
If their home language is Spanish, the test is administered in Spanish.
If their home language is other than Spanish, SPISD tests students using an informal oral language assessment.
After students are tested, the district's Language Proficiency Assessment Committee (LPAC) reviews their scores and determines if students need LEPservices.The board appoints the LPAC committee every year.After students are classified as LEP, the LPAC requests approval from their parents to place them in the ESL program.
(Parents must grant permission before a student can be provided with LEP services.)
SPISD does not provide bilingual classes because it does not have the number of students at any grade level needed to support a bilingual teacher.
FINDING
SPISD's teachers do not believe the district's English as a Second Language program is effective.
ESL students are placed in a pullout ESL program or taught in regular education classes with modifications.
The elementary school offers a 50-minute daily pullout program for students who need this service.
The middle school and high schools offer an ESL class to help students with Language Arts.
While only 22 percent of the district's parents responded to the TSPR survey with dissatisfaction in the ESL program, 64.3 of the teachers rated the district's ESL program as ineffective.
Exhibit 2-16 shows the survey results regarding the ESL program.

Region 1 provides several programs to help school districts strengthen bilingual/ESL programs.
One such project is the Comprehensive Title VII project being implemented in Roma ISD, Hidalgo ISD and Weslaco ISD.
The program trains teachers to use ESL methodologies and Spanish instruction in all subject areas to teach LEP and non-LEP students alike.
This is intended to enhance the English and Spanish language proficiency of students, by providing training, technical assistance and follow-up services to teachers, teacher-aides and parents.
Region 1 also offers the Bilingual/ESL consortium, which provides ongoing staff development.
Recommendation 11:
Strengthen English as a Second Language services by using technical assistance offered through Region 1.
The district should contact the director of bilingual/ESL services at Region 1 for help with developing and implementing a solid ESL program.
Region 1 staff will visit the district and provide ongoing technical assistance and training as SPISD develops a program for providing more effective ESL services.
Region 1 can also help the district identify and apply for grants to strengthen bilingual/ESL services.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The director of Curriculum contacts Region 1 for information regarding technical assistance in the area of ESL instruction.
April 2002 2.
SPISD's director of Curriculum meets with Region 1 staff and develops a plan for improving ESL services.
May 2002 3.
SPISD ESL staff works with Region 1 in implementing the planned changes for delivery of ESL services.

The director of Curriculum monitors program effectiveness and seeks help from Region 1 as needed.
Ongoing
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation could be implemented using existing resources.
Gifted and Talented
Texas law requires all school districts to identify and provide services to students identified as gifted and talented (G/T).
In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students, a guide intended to help school districts meet the state's requirements.
In 1996, SBOE updated the plan to incorporate the Texas Education Code Section 29.123 requirements.
The updated plan attempts to ensure program accountability for state-mandated G/T services.
The goal of effective Gifted/Talented programs is to keep these high-ability students engaged in the process of schooling.
FINDING
SPISD's percentage of students identified as gifted and talented is above the state and Region 1 averages.
In 2001-02, SPISD identified 11.4 percent of its students as G/T, compared to 8.4 percent for the state and 8.8 percent for Region 1.
The identification process occurs during the spring semester of every year.
Staff members, parents or other students nominate students.
At the high school level, students may self-nominate.
The district posts a public notice in the spring regarding nominations for the Gifted/Talented program.
After the nominations have been received, the counselor proceeds to request parent permission for testing.
The Identification Committee screens the students who have been nominated.
The committee reviews grades, assessments; parent questionnaires and achievement test scores and determines whether the student qualifies for G/T services.
COMMENDATION
SPISD has a strong gifted and talented student identification process.
FINDING
While the district does an excellent job of identifying gifted and talented students, it lacks a strong program for serving its G/T students.
Exhibit 2-17 provides survey results regarding the district's effectiveness in the gifted and talented program.
Teacher and administrator/support staff surveys showed that more than 33 percent disagreed that the district's G/T program is effective.
Exhibit 2-17 indicates survey results on the effectiveness of the G/T program.

Source: TSPR survey results, November 2001.
The 31 students identified as gifted and talented in 2000-01 were served primarily in the regular classroom.
The principals said that all SPISD teachers are trained in gifted and talented instruction and that they modify their curricula to meet these students' needs.
Students at the middle school have a daily class in which they work on special projects in addition to the work they get in the regular classroom.
Districts across the state have successfully implemented the recommendations in the state plan for gifted and talented education, and have used creative, innovative programs that have been allocated the necessary staff to implement the plan.
Recommendation 12:
Develop goals, objectives and strategies for improving the gifted and talented program.
The district should use the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students as a guide in improving its G/T program.
This could be done in various ways.
One alternative would be for the district to develop relationships with neighboring school districts to create an Advanced Academic Cooperative allowing member districts to share teachers, curricula and resources.
The district could seek help from Region 1 in this effort.
In addition, to begin strengthening its program, the district should appoint a committee to develop goals, objectives, strategies and evaluation techniques to be incorporated in the district and campus improvement plans.
These would serve as a guide for building and evaluating the program.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The superintendent creates an Advanced Academics advisory committee composed of a teacher from each school and a community representative.
April 2002 2.
The Advanced Academics advisory committee conducts a needs assessment of the gifted and talented program.
April - May 2002 3.
The committee determines the extent to which each school in the district is implementing the recommendations in the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.
April - May 2002 4.
The Advanced Academics committee develops a three- to five-year plan for achieving exemplary status as outlined in the state plan and secures staff and board approval.
June 2002 5.
The director of Curriculum incorporates the plan into the district and campus improvement plans.
June 2002 6.
The committee evaluates the plan.

FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation can could be implemented with existing resources.
FINDING
SPISD has a state-of-the-art distance learning lab that goes unused.
The distance learning lab instead houses students in the disciplinary Alternative Education Placement program and the On Campus Suspension program (OCS).
In Fall 2001, the district attempted to offer higher-level, college credit courses in partnership with Texas State Technical College (TSTC) through the district's distance learning lab but the plans fell through due to lack of student interest.
Three senior class students who had initially shown an interest in these classes chose to stay with their peers in the regular classroom just before the 2001-02 school year began.
The district has an articulation agreement with TSTC that allows students to take college-credit courses through the distance learning lab tuition-free.
The distance learning lab was developed in 1995-96 with funds provided through the Distance Learning and Telemedicine grant.
The distance learning lab was intended to enable neighboring school districts to expand the course offerings available at each school, however, district staff said that teachers in the other school districts (Raymondville, San Isidro and Mirando City) were unable to coordinate their teaching schedules in order to make the distance learning lab work as initially envisioned.
In addition, TSPR's parent, student and teacher surveys indicated that the respondents feel the district's offering of advanced courses is weak.
The percentage of SPISD high school students completing advanced courses such as chemistry, physics, advanced foreign languages and computer science is only 10.6 percent, well below the state average of 17.5 percent.
Districts fortunate enough to have a distance leaning lab, offer dual high/school college credit courses to students at their home campus.
This means that a high school student can access a college-credit course and not have to travel to that college or university to attend classes.
All instruction can be accessed in the convenience of their home campus' distance learning lab and still obtain college credit after meeting all course requirements.
Recommendation 13:
Use the distance learning lab to offer advanced courses.
To help ensure adequate student interest and participation in the distance learning lab, teachers and the high school counselor should begin promoting the benefits of taking dual high school/college credit courses.
One way the district can help motivate students to take college-credit classes is by inviting recent San Perlita ISD graduates now in college, to speak with the secondary students about the importance of a solid academic background and accessing as many advanced courses as possible.
The district should also reopen dialogue with neighboring districts to promote the use of the learning lab for students needing to access advantaged classes.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The secondary principal and school counselor seek input from teachers and students to identify the core academic areas in most need of advanced level curricula and begin promoting classes to be offered to seniors through the distance learning lab.
April 2002 2.
The secondary principal and school counselor develop strategies to motivate students and other school district staff to promote the use of the distance learning lab.
May 2002 3.
The secondary principal submits the strategies to the superintendent for approval.
June 2002 4.
The superintendent approves the strategies.
June 2002 5.

Career and Technology Education (CATE)
Career and technology education (CATE) programsare designed toprepare students for the workplace.
Section 29.181 of the Texas Education Code requires school districts to provide a curriculum that affords each student the opportunity to "master the basic skills and knowledge necessary for managing the dual roles of family member and wage earner; gaining entry-level employment in a high-skill, high-wage job or continuing the student's education at the post-secondary level."
The Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 74, Subchapter A requires school districts to offer career technology education courses in at least three of eight areas: agricultural science and technology, business, health science technology, home economics, technology/industrial technology, marketing, trade and industrial and career orientation.
FINDING
The CATE program is not preparing students for careers in computer and technology.
The course offerings in this area are limited to keyboarding and word processing applications.
The program emphasizes agricultural science and includes a few business courses serving approximately 85 students.
SPISD's high school students each have a computer with Internet access in their homes.
The district is able to offer this resource through a USDA grant.
While students have ample access to computers, the district lacks the classes to build expertise in computer technology.
Students would benefit from classes such as Web site design, desktop publishing, computer programming and repair and database design and management.
Exhibit 2-18 lists SPISD's course offerings.

Santa Gertrudis ISD, a small school district with less than 300 students, has developed a strong instructional technology program.
High school students can enroll in a four-year career/technology program that begins with basic computer application and graphic skills and culminates with experience in business management and entrepreneurship.
As seniors, students work in the production, marketing, sales and service of computers.
Effective CATE programs maximize school resources and coordinate their course offerings with area colleges and businesses to optimize their training and employment opportunities.
Recommendation 14:
Expand the CATE program to include computer and technology courses that will prepare students for careers or continued education.
The director of Curriculum/Technology explores opportunities to expand the CATE program to include new computer classes.
The district should seek aid from Region 1 for staff development in teaching computer technology courses.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE

Library Program
The 1995 Legislature rewrote all of the state's public education laws, returning a great deal of authority to local school districts.
Legislation affecting school libraries was changed to read as follows:
The Texas State Library and Archives Commission, in consultation with the State Board of Education, shall adopt standards for school library services.
A school district shall consider the standards in developing, implementing of expanding library services.
(Texas Education Code 33.021).
Texas School Libraries, a study prepared for the Texas State Library and Archives Commission in 2001 found that 10 percent more students at schools with librarians met the minimum TAAS requirements in reading than in schools without librarians.
While socio-economic variables account for the greatest difference in TAAS reading scores across the state, the variance associated with the presence of a librarian on campus is significant.
At the high school level, the library variable accounted for 8.2 percent of the variance in TAAS reading scores.
In general, library variables were more predictive of TAAS reading scores than the number of school computers per student, teacher experience and teacher turnover.
FINDING
While the library has excellent computer equipment and offers access to the Internet, it has an inadequate book collection and does not meet state-recommended standards.
In addition, the district does not have a certified librarian.
Local district policy EFB states that the district shall provide and maintain a library media program as an integral part of the district's instructional resources.
The district's library located in the high school facility, serves 264 students in grades pre-K through 12, in 2001-02.
It is staffed by a library aide who is working to complete a bachelor's degree and has 8.5 years of experience in public libraries.
In interviews with the library aide, he stated that his primary goal for this school year was to have the library system fully automated by December 2001.
Once the system was automated, he would be able to better assess the library's needs and begin updating its collection.
At the time of TSPR's review, the district had no inventory of its book collection, which the librarian estimated at about 7,000 outdated books.
Of these, the library aide estimated 5,000 to be elementary level.
In addition, the library's research resources formiddle and high school students are grossly inadequate.Each classroom visits the library once a week but, due to its limited collection, students spend more time in the library being tested or working on computers than on reading.
The library aide said one of his goals is to get the students to enjoy reading but that this is difficult to accomplish given the poor selection of reading material.
The district's student achievement improvement plan found in the DIP lists the library as a resource for improving high school student performance.
The strategy is to encourage high school students to participate in the Accelerated Reader Program; however, there is little to entice high school readers in the Accelerated Reader book collection.
The library aide stated he has had difficulty in getting students to select books from the secondary accelerated reader collection.
SPISD students also do not have a community library to supplement the district collection.
The closest public library is in Raymondville, about nine miles from San Perlita.
In May 1997, the Texas State Library and Archives Commission adopted a series of recommended standards published as School Library Program Standards: Guidelines and Standards.
The goal of the school library program outlined in the Guidelines and Standards is to ensure that students and staff alike become effective users of ideas and information and literate, life-long learners.
To accomplish this task, the library program should provide instruction in research and the evaluation of resources, individual guidance and access to materials in multiple formats.
To assist districts, the guidelines offer criteria that identify library programs as exemplary, recognized, acceptable or below standard in the areas of the library learning environment, curriculum integration, resources, library program management and facilities.
Many small districts explore various ways such as grant funding to access needed funds for improving their library programs.
The American Association of School Libraries (ALA) offers internet resource guides on collection development and grant sources.
The ALA Web site is www.ala.org.
Another Web site that compiles a list of federal, state and foundation grants targeted for schools is www.schoolgrants.org.
This site allows the user to search by area of interest, type of grant or area.
The Texas Library Connection, a free service from TEA provides online resources equivalent to $32,000 of printed materials.
Other districts increase the services they provide students through partnerships with governments, community agencies or other school districts.
SPISD already shares a Spanish teacher with Lyford ISD and has partnered with the City of San Perlita for playground facilities.
Recommendation 15:
Update and expand the library's book collection to meet state recommended "acceptable" standards.
The district should bring the district library up to "acceptable" standards as defined in the School Library Program Standards: Guidelines and Standards, by first focusing on upgrading its library book collection.
The district should explore funding opportunities by applying for grants to assist them in the needed library upgrades and should match 50 percent of those funds.
The district contracts for its grant writing function.
In addition the district should consider forming a partnership with the city that might result in transforming the San Perlita ISD library into a community library.
The city could be responsible for hiring a certified librarian and additional staff, while the district would provide the facilities and material resources.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE
1.
The superintendent instructs the district's library aide to identify grant opportunities to begin upgrading the library's book collection.
April 2002 2.
The superintendent seeks approval from the board to contract with the grant writer.
May 2002 3.
The board approves the grant writer.
May 2002 4.
The grant writer is contracted with and begins to write grants.
August 2002 5.
The superintendent seeks approval from the board to match 50 percent of grant monies obtained for library upgrades.
January 2003 6.
The superintendent explores forming partnerships with the City of San Perlita to consider making the school library a community library, sharing expenses.
June 2003 7.
The board approves the 50 percent funding match.
June 2003 8.
The library aide purchases 500 new books.
July 2003
FISCAL IMPACT
This recommendation assumes that the district would match 50 percent of the costs of upgrading the library's book collection.
The district would use the first year, 2002-03, to identify and apply for grants.
To purchase 500 new books at $18 per copy will cost a total of $9,000 (500 books x $18 = $9,000).
Half of these funds ($4,500) are assumed will come from grants and half from district funds.
The district would pay the contract grant writer $275 a day x 2.5 days or approximately $700 per grant.
Costs are estimated with the assumption that the grant writer would be contracted to write five grants the initial year.
In the first year, the grant writer would be paid from general funds.
In subsequent years the grant funds should be able to pay for the cost of the grant writer.

Health and Wellness Services
FINDING
Despite its limited resources, SPISD offers comprehensive health services to its students.
SPISD employs one licensed vocational nurse to serve 264 students in the district for 2001-02.
The nurse maintains health and student immunization records, stores medical release forms in case of a medical emergency and dispenses medication in accordance with proper policies and procedures.
All health records are locked in a drawer to protect students' identities.
The nurse also provides vision, hearing and spinal screening once a year.
The nurse also conducts home visits when students have been absent for more than two consecutive days.
On November 28, 2001, San Perlita ISD offered free dental screening to all students with cooperation from Su Clinica, a local community clinic.
Permission forms were sent to parents in English and Spanish and returned by November 16, 2001.
The screening made parents aware of any potential dental problems.
COMMENDATION
The nurse provides outstanding health services to students.
Special Education
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires districts to provide free and appropriate public education for all children with disabilities regardless of the severity of their disability.
The law requires, moreover, that this education be provided in the "least restrictive environment."
Students with disabilities must be included in state and district assessment programs.
IDEA also requires school districts to develop an individualized education program (IEP) for each child receiving special education services.
The IEP is expected to include input from regular education teachers and to be coordinated with the education plans for students in regular education.
IDEA recommends that the following practices be implemented to effectively serve students with disabilities: 1.
Pre-referral intervention in regular education.
When a student experiences an academic problem in the regular education program, intervention should occur.
If steps taken by the regular education teacher do not support satisfactory results, the problem(s) should be referred to special education staff.
2.
Referral to special education for evaluation.
Referring a student to special education means writing an official request with supported documentation.
The referral information must include an explanation of steps that have been taken in regular education to solve the problem prior to referral.
3.
Comprehensive nondiscriminatory evaluation.
Once a student has been referred to special education, the district must provide a comprehensive nondiscriminatory evaluation or assessment within a prescribed amount of time.
4.
Initial placement through an Admission, Review, and Dismissal (ARD) committee.
After the assessment is complete, a meeting is held to discuss the results and determine if the student qualifies for special educational services in one of 13 categories.
If the student qualifies, an IEP plan is written for the student's education.
5.
Provision of educational services and supports according to a written Individualized Education Program (IEP).
The ARD committee develops an IEP, which includes information regarding the classes, subject areas, development areas, and life skills courses in which the student will be instructed.
The IEP also includes information regarding the amount time the student will spend in regular education as well as related needs like counseling, guidance, or speech therapy.
6.
Annual program review.
Each year after a student's initial qualification and placement, an ARD committee conducts a review to ensure the student's IEP is appropriate.
7.
Three-year re-evaluation.
Every three years, the student undergoes a comprehensive individual assessment and another ARD committee meeting is held to discuss the results of the re-evaluation.
This evaluation will identify if the student still qualifies for special education services in the same category.
8.
Dismissal from the special education program.
If and when a student no longer meets the criteria for eligibility, the student is dismissed from special education.
The ARD committee is responsible for making this decision.
SPISD's Special Education program has a pre-referral intervention process in place.
Students who have difficulty learning in the classroom are referred to an Instructional Intervention Team composed of the district's principals, the counselor, nurse, classroom teacher and a parent.
The team reviews the referral packets and develops plans to attempt to resolve concerns in the regular classroom setting.
The plans include specific strategies for teachers to use in an effort to meet the student's needs in the least restrictive environment.
Students who continue to perform below grade-level academic standards are referred for Special Education services.

FINDING
SPISD is a member of the WIL-CAM Pupil Services Cooperative for special education programs.
The WIL-CAM cooperative includes Lasara, Lyford, San Perlita, Santa Rosa, Raymondville and Rio Hondo.
The cooperative operates under local district policies and WIL-CAM cooperative managing board policies.
The six superintendents of the school districts served by WIL-CAM are members of the managing board and manage the cooperative in compliance with federal and state laws.
Each school district contributes funding each year for the operation of the cooperative.
In return, the school districts avoid the need to contract for additional personnel to meet serve special education students.
WIL-CAM is staffed by 12 employees and is housed at Raymondville ISD.
The staff includes the director of special services, an instructional supervisor, head educational diagnostician, various diagnosticians, counselors, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist and a speech therapist.
The services offered to participating school districts are: * directorship of the special education program * supervision of special education teachers * diagnostician testing * counseling * physical therapy * occupational therapy * speech therapy; and * medical exams for students
Participation in WILCAM is a cost-effective way for the district to offer these services.
COMMENDATION
SPISD participates in a special education cooperative that provides services and personnel for special education students.
