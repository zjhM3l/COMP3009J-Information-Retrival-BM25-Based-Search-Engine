Birds of Everglades National Park Introduction Everglades National Park was established in 1947 to protect the rich resources of South Florida's subtropical wilderness wetlands, particularly the diverse and abundant bird life.
Birds have always been one of the park's principal activities for park visitors.
Compiled in 1984 this list provides of the 347 species of birds observed within Everglades National Park, along with a key indicating the abundance and seasonal occurrence of each species.
It follows earlier checklist compiled by William B. Robertson, Jr.
Willard E. Dilley, John C. Ogden and R.L. Cunningham and reflects the continuing growth of information about the birds of the Park.
As noted in the list, many birds are known in Everglades National Park from only a few records.
Users of this checklist can contribute to updating future lists by carefully recording details of their observations of less common species and reporting the information to park personnel.
