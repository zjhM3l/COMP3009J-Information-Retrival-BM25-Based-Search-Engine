The Department of Homeland Security and Coast Guard are asking you report any suspicious or peculiar activity that you may observe.
Please make all reports to the U.S. Coast Guard via VHF-FM CH 16 or by using your cell phone dial 911, to the National Response Center (NRC) at 1-800-424-8802 or to the DHS Watch and Warning unit at (202) 323-3205.

Mariners have been advised that there has been an amendment to the Chesapeake Bay Regulated Navigation Area which requires all vessels 300 gross tons and over, including tug and barge combined, to obtain permission prior to entering, departing, and/or moving within the Regulated Navigation Area.
To obtain permission, vessels shall contact the Joint Harbor Operations Center (JHOC) prior to entry or movement via channel 12, alternate 13/16 VHF-FM and relay vessel documentation number, IMO number or VIN for verification.
This includes entries from offshore, James River, Chesapeake Bay or Intracoastal Waterway.

If the JHOC cannot be reached, the Captain of the Port (COPT) Command Duty Officer may be reached at (757) 668-5555.
REQUIRED BALLASTWATER MANAGEMENT REPORTS FOR VESSELS OPERATING OUTSIDE THE EEZ Mariners are reminded that in accordance with 33 CFR 151.2040, all vessels which carry ballast water, including residual ballast water and sediments, are asked to submit a ballast water management report after operating outside the EEZ at their first port of call in U.S. waters.
These reports may be transmitted electronically to http://invasions.si.edu/ballast.htm, e-mailed to ballast@serc.si.edu, faxed to Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, c/o the NBIC at 301-261-4319, or mailed to U.S. Coast Guard, c/o Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), P.O.

VA-MD-CHESAPEAKE BAY-POTOMAC RIVER-PINEY POINT TO LOWER CEDAR POINT The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division will establish a temporary unlit, white mooring buoy on the Potomac River Test Range from February 3, 2004 through February 6, 2004, in approximate position 38-16.704N, 076-56.920W.
Mariners are urged to use caution when transiting the area and to contact Dahlgren Range Control on VHF-FM Marine Radio Channel 16, or telephone number (540) 653-8791, if necessary.
Chart 12286.
VA Â­ MD Â­ POTOMAC RIVER Â­ WOODROW WILSON BRIDGE Â­ BRIDGE INFO Mariners are advised that contractors are continuing construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Memorial Drawbridge across the Potomac River, mile 103.8, between the City of Alexandria, Virginia and Oxon Hill, Maryland.
Excessive speed and wake by boaters have caused the potential for serious or fatal incidents to the Bridge project.
It is crucial that mariners obey the speed restrictions and eliminate wakes through the work zone due to the sensitive and precise nature of the work and for worker safety.
A temporary floating causeway, extending from the Jones Point Park bulkhead to the Virginia-side drawbridge foundation has been installed and will be in place during drawbridge construction.
Work platform construction will be completed during the fall of 2003 on the new Maryland-side drawbridge foundation and falsework/formwork erection will continue for the new drawbridge.
These activities will require intermittent day-time channel restrictions as a result of crane barge positioning.
Mariners are urged to use extreme caution when transiting this area for work barges, exposed piles, and anchor buoys.
Dredging is being done by Langenfelder Marine, and is expected to continue until further notice (probably 2 months).
Three barges are being operated in rotation, with one in tow at any given time.
Dredge scows are being staged from a mooring buoy located east of the Potomac River navigation channel, south of the bridge, in approx position 38 47.342 N and 77 02.130 W.
The mooring buoy and barges are marked and lighted.
For further information and updates to construction operations, contact Mr. Mike Baker, Environmental Construction Manager for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Project at 301-567-0094 Ext 242 or visit the Project's website online at www.wilsonbridge.com.
