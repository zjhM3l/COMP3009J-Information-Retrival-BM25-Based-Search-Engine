TOXICOLOGY SUMMARY See also AGuidance for the Re- registration of Pesticide Products Containing Azinphos- methyl@, (Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs, September, 1986).
The Re registration standard indicates that studies were required in all areas except chronic dog, oncogenicity in the mouse and unscheduled DNA synthesis.

Azinphos- Methyl (purity 87.2%) was administered in the feed at concentrations of 0 (vehicle = 1% DAB8 peanut oil), 5, 15 or 45 ppm to 10 (12 months) and 50 (24 months) SPF Wistar (Bor: WISW [SPF Cpb]) rats/sex/group.

NOTE: An NCI bioassay was published in 1978.
High dose levels in that study were about 3- fold higher than the high dose groups in the above Bayer study.
The one- liner for the NCI study is found under "Oncogenicity, Rat" (below).
That study found possible increases in tumor incidences in high dose males (pancreatic islet cell adenoma or adenocarcinoma; thyroid follicular cell adenoma, cystadenoma or adenocarcinoma; and adrenal cortical adenoma and adenocarcinoma).
There are several reasons why results of the NCI study cannot be considered to have been superseded by record 074676, above.
The difference in dosage ranges was already mentioned.
Both of the studies indicated appreciable evidence of toxicity in one or both sexes (clear body weight decrements in the NCI study in both sexes: modest, but apparently treatment- associated decrement in body weights of high dose males in the above Bayer study).
The Bayer study was toward the low end of an acceptable range of dosages, whereas the NCI study probably exceeded an appropriate "MTD" during the first 20 weeks of treatment in males (before high dose ration of azinphos- methyl was reduced from 250 to 125 ppm).
Also, the two studies differed in strain of rats employed, type of diet, duration of dosing, and type of caging.
The design of the NCI study left more open to speculation about possible tumorigenicity than did the Bayer study, due to the small size of the concurrent control group and to the lack of a third treated group.
In summary, the data from the accepted Bayer study above shows no evidence of neoplasia at dosages up to 45 ppm, whereas the older NCI study presents equivocal evidence of treatment effects in males at the highest dosage (time- weighted average dose of 156 ppm), which apparently exceeded the MTD during part of the study.
The possibility that tumors observed in high dose males in the NCI study may have been treatment- related cannot be dismissed on the basis of the Bayer study, however the latter study appears to be much more relevant for human risk assessment of possible chronic low- dose exposure.

Azinphos- methyl, E 1582, Batch # 233 896 032, 91.1% pure at 0, 5, 25 and 125 ppm in feed to 4 beagle dogs/sex/group.
Liver effects consisting of decreased serum albumin, increased cytochrome P- 450 and decreased liver weight were observed, but there were no corresponding histopathological findings.
Brain AChE was inhibited 26% in males and 20% in females at 52 weeks in the 125 ppm dose group; cholinergic NOEL: 5 ppm.
No Adverse effect.
Originally unacceptable because no justification was given for the dose levels chosen; animals may not have been adequately challenged.

154- 257 098124 [Addendum to 254:89216].
This study supplies the range- finding data that were listed as deficient in the original review of 254:089216.
Azinphos- methyl was administered to beagle dogs (1 male and female per dose) at levels of 0, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 400 ppm for 19 weeks.
Whole- blood cho linesterase was inhibited 50% compared to control by week 19 in the 100 ppm dose group; clinical signs at 100 ppm consisted of occasional muscle spasms and tremors.
These additional data justify the doses used in the 52- week study and permit an upgrade of study 254:089216 to acceptable status.

(Mobay No. 100646, Bayer AG, Dept.
Of Toxicology, Germany, 10/8/90.)
Azinphos- methyl, 91.7% purity (3/24/88 analysis), was fed in the diet at 0, 5, 15 and 45 ppm to SPF- bred Wistar rats (strain Bor:WISW; SPF Cpb) to 18 male and 46 female animals per group, 1 generation, 1 litter (plus 3 additional groups of 10 males treated with 5, 15 and 45 ppm and 20 untreated females/group).
Statistically significant ChE inhibition was seen in all 15 and 45 ppm parental rats; for 5 ppm dosed F0 rats, only erythrocyte ChE for females on day 28 p.p. showed notable inhibition: Cholinergic NOEL = 5 ppm.
Viability index and body weight gain of pups were significantly reduced at 15 and 45 ppm doses: Reproductive NOEL = 5 ppm.
Inhibition of pup brain AChE detected in 45 ppm group on day 5 and 28 p.p.
This study supports the conclusions in record 061965, 061966 that reduction in certain reproductive parameters occurs at the same level as significant ChE inhibition in F0 parental rats, but it does not establish a definitive link between adverse reproductive effects and maternal toxicity/stress at 15 ppm azinphos- methyl.

Azinphos- methyl, 91.9%, was tested with human lymphocytes from one male and one female subject at 0, 1, 10 or 100 ug/ml for 24 hours without activation and at 0, 5, 50 or 500 ug/ml for 2.5 hours with rat liver S9 activation, followed by 21.5 hours further incubation.
Two cultures per concentration per subject; scored 100 cells from each subject per concentration for aberrations and 4000 total for mitotic index from the preliminary, range- finding test.
No increase in aberrations without S9 at any concentration but a several- fold increase in aberrations (excluding gaps), metaphases with exchanges and in metaphases with polyploidy at 500 ug/ml with activation in the presence of a mitotic index approximately 43% of control.
No confirming repeat with activation.
ACCEPTABLE.

Miles Report No. 106839.
Eighteen rats/sex/group were dosed with azinphos- methyl (92.4%) at 0, 15, 45, or 120 ppm (males) or 0, 15, 45, or 90 ppm (females) for 13 weeks.
Six/sex/group were monitored for RBC and plasma cholinesterase at weeks 0, 4, and 13.
Also, brain cholinesterase was measured in these rats at termination.
The remaining 12/sex/group were subject to evaluations of motor activity and FOB evaluations.
At termination, 6/sex/group were perfused and prepared for microscopic evaluation.
Only controls and high dose animals were so examined, since there was no high dose histopathological effect.
No cholinesterase inhibition NOEL was determined: dose- related inhibition was observed in brain, RBC, and plasma cholinesterase over the range tested.
A conservative NOEL for findings other than cholinesterase enzyme assays was 15 ppm, based on slightly increased reactivity and on a general increase in incidence or degree of urine- stained coat in females.
Common findings at 90 to 120 ppm included increased reactivity, coat stains (especially perianal stains in males, and urine stains in females), body weight decrements, and a decrease in motor and locomotor activity.
Also, findings primarily or exclusively in 90 ppm females included uncoordinated gait, tremor, uncoordinated righting reflex, reduced diet intake, and a decrement in forelimb grip strength.
Study is acceptable , with no adverse subchronic neurotoxicity indicated.
Acute/subacute cholinesterase- related effects are relevant to safety assessment.

Laboratory Project ID: ICR 013580.
Twelve healthy men (aged 18- 50 yr, non- smokers) were randomly assigned to either placebo (N = 4) or treatment group (N = 8).
Study was under auspices of an Independent Research Ethics Committee.
All subjects received one gelatin capsule daily [0.25 mg/kg/day Azinphos- methyl (91.6% purity) for treated men, or lactose for the placebo group] for 28 days.
Subjects resided in the clinic during the entire study, under Aconstant medical and nursing supervision@ and Areceived a standardized diet.@ They were evaluated for vital signs daily just before dosing and 24 hr after the last treatment.
EKG=s were obtained before dosing on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28.
Blood and urine samples were taken on the same schedule for hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis.
In addition, plasma and RBC cholinesterase assays were performed on blood samples taken on pre- study days - 14, - 12, - 10, 8, - 6, - 4, - 2, and - 1, as well as daily before each dose, and 4 hr post- dose on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, and 28.

Laboratory Project ID: ICR 013219.
A copy of a memorandum from Jay Schreider dated 3/31/99 is found in the front section of this volume.
This memo considered the study appropriate for use in risk assessment.
No plasma or RBC inhibition was found at oral (gelatin capsule) dose levels as high as 0.75 mg/kg in either sex of adult subjects.
An adjunct group of males was also tested at 1.0 mg/kg, similarly negative for cholinesterase inhibition.
None of the other measured parameters [comparable to those evaluated in the subsequent repeat- dose study (154- 318 182478)] indicated adverse effects.
The DPR review describes in detail the steps taken to ensure the safety of the subjects and to meet the standards of the Independent Research Ethics Committee.
A key to subject safety was review of results of each completed group prior to advancing to a higher dose level.

An epidemiology study in which a cohort of 90 male apple orchard applicators from New York State were evaluated to determine if short- term exposure to azinphos- methyl produced acute health effects.
The applicators were first questioned off season and then again during the spraying season for the presence of several acute signs and symptoms.
Short- term exposure was validated by measuring dimethylthiophosphate in the urine.
Chronic signs of peripheral nerve damage were determined by vibration sensitivity thresholds in both hands and feet during the off season.
Long- term exposure to pesticides was determined by questionnaire.
Seventy- eight applicators (86%) had used azinphosmethyl during the previous two growing seasons.
The mean number of years azinphos- methyl had been used by the applicators was 14 years.
The average number of applications per season was 5 times.
Of the acute signs and symptoms related to organophosphate pois oning, only headaches were more frequent during the spraying season than off.
The mean vibration threshold scores for the hands were significantly higher for applicators when compared with scores for the population based controls matched on age, sex, and county of residence.
