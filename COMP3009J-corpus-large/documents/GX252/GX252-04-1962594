Isabel's Impacts on Pumpouts Many marinas around the region either lost or experienced damage to their pumpout systems.
To date, over 80 marinas have notified the Department that their pumpouts were affected by the storm.
Some of these pumpouts are now operational, at least temporarily, and others are in the process of being replaced.
The pumpout program's goal is to see as many units as possible back on line by the 2004 boating season.
Repairing a pumpout, if possible, is preferable to complete replacement.
Because many units were submerged in salt water for an extended period of time, there is an understandable concern about how long "repaired" pumpout units will continue to operate.
At the same time, however, several marinas have taken advantage of pumpout operations and maintenance (O
For pumpout units beyond repair, program staff request that marinas explore all insurance options before seeking a grant to replace the unit.
For pumpouts that are both destroyed and uninsured, marinas may apply for a grant to replace it.

Marina program will again hold a series of introductory workshops for marina operators.
They will be held in key locations around the State, but the content of each workshop will be the same.
Each workshop will provide: 3.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ An introduction to the structure and goals of the program, Ã¯Â¿Â½ An explanation of the steps to become a certified clean marina, Ã¯Â¿Â½ A Clean Marina Guidebook, Pledge, and Award Checklist for interested participants (no cost), Ã¯Â¿Â½ Solutions to common stumbling blocks to certification (i.e., templates for commonly needed plans at marinas and boatyards, marina Participants at the 2003 workshop in Annapolis management and staff and steps to certification as a Clean Marina.
training tools); and Ã¯Â¿Â½ Free lunch! The clean marina program and workshops are designed for managers of all sizes and types of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs.
Participants will walk away with many useful tools 4.
for improving management of their facilities and a better understanding of the incentives to becoming certified.
An owner or operator of a certified Clean Marina will speak about his or her experience in the program and how it has affected his or her business.
This first-hand account should help explain the certification process for those who are unfamiliar.
Advanced registration will be necessary and announcements and registration forms will be mailed directly to all marinas on the division's current mailing list.
There will 5.
be no charge to attend the workshops.
While the workshops are an effective, concise way to learn about the goals and structure of the Clean Marina Initiative, marinas are welcome to join the program at any time.
To review, the steps to certification are: 1.
Sign the Clean Marina Pledge:
Hartge Yacht Yard is a well-respected facility that has served boaters around the West River area for generations.
This facility has about 200 slips, a fuel dock, and a multitude of boating services (i.e., rigging , fiberglass, woodshop) on site.
At this step a press release is issued to local papers and the marina's name appears on the Clean Marina web site.
Conduct a Self-Assessment: Using the Clean Marina Guidebook and Checklist, marina and boatyard operators run through the questions, and see how close they already are to certification and where they need improvement.
Call Upon a Mentor : Invariably, questions of interpretation and applicability of the questions on the Checklist arise.
A call to the office of either the Clean Marina program (410260-8770) or the Marine Trades Association (410-2690741) can easily answer many questions or, if needed, find a source to assist with technical questions.
Additionally, the Clean Marina program staff can set up an informal walk through of a marina to help determine what they may need to become certified.
Many templates are included learn about the benefits in the Guidebook (to assist with stormwater plans, emergency plans, and employee training) and confidential compliance assistance is also available to assist in permitting issues.
Schedule a Confirmation Visit: After the "mentoring" stage, marina managers and program staff can be confident the facility is meeting the minimum scores in all areas of the Checklist.
A confirmation visit, conducted by a Clean Marina program staff member and a manager of a certified clean marina, is completed to verify the items on the Checklist.
Any deficiencies found do not result in a penalty, but rather with assistance to rectify them.
Enjoy the Rewards: Certified Clean Marinas receive an award certificate (signed by the Governor, Lt. Governor and Secretary of DNR), a large flag and small burgee to fly at the facility, permission to use the Clean Marina logo in their advertising and on their letterhead, and Clean Marina caps.
Another press release is issued--statewide--announcing the certification, the marina receives its own online business card on the Clean Marina web site, and is prominently promoted in displays at boat shows and in the newsletter.
Maintain the Clean Marina Status: Annually, marinas confirm in writing that they continue to meet the award standards described on the Clean Marina Award Checklist.
At least every third year, a Clean Marina representative will revisit the facility to ensure it still meets award standards.
! Seven New Certified Clean Marinas! During the last few months seven marinas have completed their certification as Clean Marinas.
This is a remarkable pace and will help the Clean Marina Initiative meet its goal of certifying 25 percent of the marinas in Maryland as Clean Marinas by the end of 2004.
By doing so, the Department hopes to prevent further regulation of the industry.
In September, Saefern Saddle and Yacht Club (Annapolis), Skipjack Cove Yachting Resort (Georgetown), and Worton Creek Marina (Chestertown) all became Clean Marinas.
In November three more marinas and another yacht club joined the ranks: Chesapeake Yachting Center (Essex), Taylor 's Marina (Elkton), Hartge's Yacht Yard (Galesville), and Corinthian Yacht Club (Ridge).
Skipjack Cove Yachting Resort and Worton Creek Marina both became certified as part of a recent round of Clean Marina cost- share grants (see page 2).
While the grants helped fund wash water treatment systems at both marinas (one physical and one mechanical), both Rich Lauser (Skipjack Cove) and John 
They also thoroughly reviewed necessary permits and plans, with help from the Clean Marina staff, and ensured all were up to date.

Most of what their Dockmaster, Robert Muir, did to earn the award was sharing emergency information and clean boating practices with the slip holders.
He used not only printed material but the neighborhood's secure web site to make the information readily available and easy to update.
The community has fully embraced the notion and are proud to be among the Clean Marinas in Maryland.
Chesapeake Yachting Center is a full service facility with about 200 wet slips, 200 dry slips, a fuel dock and a whole host of services.
To become certified, owner Frank Lampron and manager Russ Kirkhoff reviewed their required plans and permits, ensured they were all current, and improved their spill response kit and fueling procedures.
They also improved written emergency response plans and stormwater management plans.
Their attention to detail with the many plans and permits required for marinas that store fuel and haul boats, was especially important to their success.
Taylor 's Marina, by contrast, is a small and simple Robert Muir, Saefern Saddle 
also operate nearby Locust Point Marina (also a Clean Marina).
Taylor 's Marina simply offers slips, with water and electricity, and access to all the repair services at Locust Point.
There is also a pool and a small-engine repair shop on site.
The Guttendorf 's smartly carried over all their emergency plans and "environmental rules" for customers and contractors to Taylor 's customers.
The marinas also share the use of a portable pump-out which has proven convenient for both sets of customers.
Corinthian Yacht Club is only the second independent yacht club to become a certified Clean Marina.
(The John and Libby Patnovic, owners of first was Baltimore Yacht Club.)
This Worton Creek Marina, with their award.
helps to dispel the notion that the Clean Marina program is only for marinas and boatyards; more yacht clubs are encouraged to participate.
The yacht club is also a relatively simple operation-- no fuel or boatyard.
However, they have a club house, several piers (both covered and uncovered), a pool, and several cottages that members can rent for short term use.
To earn the award members Ron Riland and Earl Waesche, with club support, created a set of environmental rules and practices for both members and contractors, and promoted the recycling of used oil, antifreeze, batteries and other waste by posting directions to the nearest collection facility in a prominent location.
Hartge Yacht Yard is a well-respected facility that has served boaters around the West River area for generations.
This facility has about 200 slips, a fuel dock, and a multitude of boating services (i.e., rigging , fiberglass, woodshop) on site.
Manager Alex Schlegel made some improvements to his stormwater management controls, and repaired damage previously done by stormwater, as part of his certification.
He and his staff also included Clean Boating Tip Sheets (from the Clean Marina Guidebook) in mailings to all customers, to enlist their help in keeping the yard clean.
They routinely use filter cloth and dustless sanders on all boats having major work done.
They also recycle used oil, batteries, and aluminum cans.
All these facilities serve as notable examples of the conservation ethic: individual responsibility for healthy land and water.
The Clean Marina program thanks all those involved in these certifications and encourages other facilities to call the office to learn more.
Informal visits are the best way to start on the As reported in the Autumn issue of Under way, The path to certification and streamline the process.
