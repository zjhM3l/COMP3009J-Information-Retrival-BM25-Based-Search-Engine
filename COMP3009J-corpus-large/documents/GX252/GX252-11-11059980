Project Activities A. Armenia Nuclear Safety Armenian officials indicate that the Armenia Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) needs to operate until 2008-2015 to provide secure electric power.
International experts believe that more work is needed to address safety system, operational safety, safety analysis, and emergency management.
The program provides support to enable the plant to operate safely until practical energy supply alternatives are available, and to encourage Armenia to revise its energy strategy and include specific plans for plant closure and replacement capacity.
The financial management of ANPP was transferred to the Russian firm RAO-UES in order to finance nuclear fuel.
The control room computer information and warning system is being replaced to ensure that plant parameters and warning signals are reliably transmitted to the operators.
Training courses are being developed and implemented to train plant operators.
Operating procedures are being improved.
An important safety need is a full-scope training simulator.
Discussions at State indicated that the budget would not be able to support this item.
The EU/TACIS program is considering funding for this project.
ANPP is developing safety analysis documentation to clarify safety status and to meet regulatory requirements.
U.S. and Slovakian experts are providing support to ANPP and Armatom on deterministic analysis.
Plant drawings were verified to match current plant status, and a set of system descriptions was developed.
A RELAP5 computer analysis model was also developed.
1
The EU is providing support for a probabilistic analysis.
At the next project meeting in September, the U.S. team will work with Armenian experts to develop plans for a rigorous safety analysis report, including U.S., IAEA and Russian support.
Work is continuing to protect safety systems and safety components located in vital areas from sabotage.

The program will also provide technical and training assistance, including an exercise program, tailored to specific needs and requests.
Assistance will focus on building and/or providing the core elements of an emergency program, including communications and networking equipment and training; development and implementation of procedures and policy for response; instruction of training personnel; readiness assurance (including exercise programs); and development and implementation of an exercise evaluation and appraisal program.
These core elements will be integrated into the national "command center" during an emergency.
This will enable Armenia to respond effectively to accidents in order to: notify, instruct, and protect affected populations; protect the environment; and protect workers.
The results of this program will be a more effective nuclear emergency response system, with data exchange between the nuclear power plant, the national command center, and the IAEA, for rapid, reliable communication in the event of an emergency.
Milestones Â· Provide surplus DOE equipment for personnel protection and radiation measurements (March 2004) Â· Conduct two training courses (June 2004) Â· Assist in development of full scale nuclear power plant emergency exercise (Dec 2004) Â· Complete training and monitor an emergency response exercise (Dec 2004) Radioactive Sources Armenia's radiation source control program has measures in place to ensure effective handling 2
and control of sources.
Tracking of sources by the Armenian Nuclear Regulatory Authority is effective, and once the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission supplies the computerized radiation source tracking system, the overall radiation source control program will be significantly strengthened.
Armenian officials requested training and personnel protection equipment as a priority.
DOE is searching inventories of surplus equipment with the intent of transferring such equipment to Armenian agencies and will be developing a training program that Armenian authorities can to implement and sustain in the future without assistance.
Milestones Â· Provide radiation monitoring equipment (October 2003) Â· Develop a radiation source handling and control training program.
This will be developed in conjunction with Armenia University to ensure the program will be sustained in country (June 2004) Â· Provide other equipment necessary to ensure safe handling and control of sources (June 2004)
B. Kazakhstan The United States and Kazakhstan signed an Implementing Arrangement in 1999 to assist with the irreversible shutdown of the BN-350 fast-breeder reactor in Aktau.
The reactor has been defueled and spent fuel packaged for long-term disposition, a decommissioning plan has been developed, and the decontamination of the sodium coolant is underway.
NNSA is providing technical and financial assistance to place the reactor in an irreversible and radiologically safe condition pending eventual dismantlement.
Objectives include: shutdown planning and regulatory guidance; upgrading safety, fire protection, and radiation monitoring systems; and sodium decontamination, draining, and processing.
These activities will render the breeder reactor inoperable, eliminate a source of weapons-grade material, and resolve nuclear safety and environmental concerns.
This project is being carried out in cooperation with Kazakhstan, the European Union's TACIS program, the IAEA, the United Kingdom, and Japan.
The entire U.S. program (1999-2006) will cost about $25 million, and continued funding is needed from DOE, State/AID, Nuclear Disarmament Fund, and the International Science and Technology Center.
A donors' conference is being planned for early 2004 to obtain funds for decommissioning activities.
Milestones: Â· Treatment of residual sodium in the reactor coolant loops after the sodium coolant is decontaminated and drained (December 2004).
Â· Design and construction of a sodium processing facility (final design by March 2004), with facility completion by March 2006.
Â· Placing the reactor in a safe storage condition, including pacification of the drained sodium (August 2007).
C. Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant Simulators and Training Well-trained operators are essential to the safe operation of nuclear facilities.
Eight simulator 3
projects have been completed.
The Zaporizhzhya unit 3 full-scope simulator is scheduled for completion in July 2005.
Training support was provided to each of the nuclear power plants to assist with the development of training programs based on the systematic approach to training methodology.
Current activities include: integrating the function of the safety parameter display systems into simulators at South Ukraine unit 3 and Zaporizhzhya unit 1; providing simulator training and engineering support; providing additional training technology transfer related to safety parameter display systems and emergency operating instructions; and providing simulation of the emergency control room function at Zaporizhzhya unit 5 (completion planned August 2003) and Rivne unit 2 (completion planned January 2004).
In-Depth Safety Assessments (ISA) Detailed safety assessments of nuclear facilities are needed to determine the most significant risks and to establish priorities for safety upgrades.
Initial Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) results are available for three plants (South Ukraine, Rivne, and Zaporizhzhya).
The international peer review for the South Ukraine PRA indicates that the risk of the operating Ukrainian plants is somewhat higher than the desirable norm, and that the largest single risk contributor is operator error.
Reducing this risk of operator errors by implementing emergency operating instructions (EOIs) would bring the risk estimates into a more acceptable range (core damage frequency less than one ten thousandth per reactor year).
The ISAs are planned for completion in 2004/2005; however, reduced program funding will result in ISAs with some parts not completed.
Nuclear Fuel Qualification Program The Ukraine Nuclear Fuel Qualification Project (UNFQP) was formalized with a joint implementing agreement in 2000, in response to Ukraine's request for help to diversify the nuclear fuel supply, and as part of the Kharkiv Initiative.
Currently, Russia is the only vendor of fuel for Ukraine's nuclear power plants.
Assistance is being provided in the following areas: Â· Â· Â· Â· Technology transfer: equipment, documentation, computer codes for reactor core design, nuclear fuel safety analysis and licensing, and nuclear fuel use.
Training of specialists: performance-based training of personnel in nuclear fuel design, reactor core design, nuclear fuel safety analysis methodologies and licensing, nuclear fuel use, and project management.
