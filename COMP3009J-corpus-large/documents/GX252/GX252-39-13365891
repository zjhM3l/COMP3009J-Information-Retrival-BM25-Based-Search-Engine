RESOURCES Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES R -1 R-2 Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES Archeologist Profiles A Archeologist.
For many, this word arouses colorful mages of an Indiana Jones character who unearths items of beauty and value in ancient, exotic ruins.
But these popular, glamorous portrayals are rarely lived by true archeologists.
As the following biographies and interviews with archeologists who have worked at Aztec Ruins suggest, making a career in archeology requires hard work, perseverance, and love love not for fame and fortune, but for answering questions about the past.
For nearly a century, archeologists have sought answers at Aztec Ruins.
Pioneer archeologist Earl Morris, sent by the American Museum of Natural History, led the first systematic exploration in the early 1900s.
He was as interested in retrieving beautiful artifacts for display in his sponsoring museum as he was piecing together a story about the people who made them.
For many years following Morris, archeologists worked at Aztec Ruins in association with stabilization projects excavating areas alongside the walls that they repaired.
In addition, they excavated individual mounds, rooms, and areas to "beautify" the area and make way for a museum, restrooms, trails, and picnic area for visitors.
Through recent archeological research, archeologists have broadened the Aztec R uins stor y. Peter McKenna and John Stein surveyed and recorded archeological remains in the extended community surrounding the West Ruin, and suggested the role and importance of Aztec Ruins in a wider region.
Tom Windes' primary interest is in the wood that the prehistoric builders used, and how it can provide answers to questions about the dates of construction; building sequence and repair; community organization; and wood procurement, harvesting, and stockpiling.
Dabney Ford and James Trott are among a growing number of conservation archeologists those who work to preserve sites through documenting, backfilling, and treating walls.
They remind us that archeologists not only excavate sites to help answer questions about the past, they also play an important role in their long term care.
Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES R -3 Pioneer Earl Morris Archeologist Born in Chama, New Mexico.
in 1889, Morris moved with his family to Farmington when he was two years old.
His interest in uncovering the past began at the young age of three.
No federal laws at that time protected archeological sites, and many people considered artifacts free for the taking.
Morris' father collected and sold pottery he found in the area.
During a collecting excursion, young Earl's father sent him to dig where his father had worked the previous day.
With the first stroke of his pick, Earl uncovered a complete black and white dipper.
He later wrote that the incident was "... the clinching event that was to make of me an ardent pot hunter, who later on was to acquire the more creditable, and I hope earned, classification as an archeologist."
After graduating from Farmington High School in 1907, he attended the University of Colorado, where he earned a degree in psychology.
His interest in the Southwest's prehistoric inhabitants remained keen, however, and scholars of the time influenced him to turn from a pot collector into a scientist.
He experienced his first excavation at Puye an ancestral site for the people of Santa Clara Pueblo.
There he attended the first Southwestern archeological field school established by Edgar Hewett.
University Museum University of Colorado, Boulder Earl Morris was a pioneer in Southwestern archeology.
Although his work today would fall far short of the discipline's rigors, during his time, when the science of archeology was walking infant steps, Morris was at the forefront.
He helped define archeological concepts and techniques, and contributed to the knowledge and interpretation of sites across the Southwest and Mexico.
He earned admiration and notoriety for his work at A ztec Ruins, Canyon de Chelly, Bandelier, Mesa Verde, the La Plata Valley, and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
The findings and interpretations he made at Aztec Ruins enrich the breadth and details of the stories told at the monument to thousands of visitors yearly.
R-4 Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES His excavation experience broadened when, in 1915, Morris apprenticed to Nels C. Nelson, an employee of the American Museum of Natural History who was excavating in the Rio Grande area.
Nelson took a special interest in Morris, training him in the relatively new techniques of stratigraphy and cross-dating that helped establish sequential dates in sites.
During this project Morris frequently wandered off to dig in other areas, justifying this activity on the basis of his experience and training in archeology.
Although he gave his pottery finds to the University of Colorado Museum, he rarely documented or organized these digs, contradicting professional standards.
He continued this questionable pattern of digging pots for recreation while excavating another site on a museum's payr oll throughout much of his life.
However, he developed traits of determination and patience that served him well in later excavations.
Working long hours with brush and sifter, he would search through tons of dirt to locate all the pieces of a pot or piece of jewelry.
The American Museum of Natural History presented Morris with the opportunity of a lifetime when it selected him in 1916 to lead the excavation of the West Ruin at Aztec Ruins.
Excited by the prospect, Morris and his crew began clearing the site which he had visited as a boy.
During the seven-year project sponsored by the museum, Morris uncovered many rooms and kivas in the West Ruin, trenched and tested the plaza and middens, and explored the group of structures on the west side of the building called the West Annex.
As he proceeded, he used cement to repair many of the unstable walls.
He unear thed burials and funerary items; pottery; stone tools; woven items; wood objects; bones and bone tools; items made from shell, cotton, and feather; leather fragments; plant and animal remains; building materials; and raw materials such as potter's clay.
Because of the protection afforded by deep room fill and original roofs, items that would have otherwise perished survived the centuries.
Early in the excavation, he used his knowledge of stratigraphy to infer two sequential occupations of the building.
Comparing the architecture to other sites and analyzing the styles of pottery and their location in the fill of the site, Morris conjectured an earlier occupation of people related to Chaco Canyon to the south, and a later occupation of people related to the Mesa Verde region to the north.
Morris uncovered and wrote about the great kiva at Aztec in 1921 the first Southwestern archeologist to do so.
Later, in 1934, he returned to Aztec to reconstruct this impressive building, drawing upon his earlier excavations and knowledge of other Southwestern kivas.
Although the reconstruction is controversial in some aspects, it is the only building of its kind.
The many timbers used by the aboriginal builders provided material to support the science of dendrochronolog y the study of dating through tree rings.
Morris collected specimens from Aztec and throughout the Southwest, helping scientists establish the area's cultural chronology.
Morris' hopes of completely excavating the West Ruin dissolved when the American Museum failed to fund the project after 1923.
Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES R -5 Although disappointed, he sporadically excavated in and around the site for several years, and also conducted work in Colorado, Arizona, and Mexico.
He maintained other ties to Aztec.
He and his mother occupied a house at Aztec Ruins, which grew into the present visitor center.
When President Harding declared the site a national monument in 1923, Morris became the first custodian, at a salary of $12 per year.
By 1933, he and his wife Ann, who was also an archeologist, moved to Colorado, where he continued excavations.
During the final years before his death in 1956, he spent time as a writer and speaker, and occasionally as a consultant to other archeologists.
Before his death, Morris' peers recognized his contributions to Southwestern and Mexican archeology by awarding him the Alfred Vincent Kidder Award in 1953.
Humbly accepting the award, Morris summed up his accomplishments: "When I measure the little that I have accomplished against the goals that danced before me when I was young, I find myself more worthy of censure than of commendation.
The years have sped and the long shelf that one day was to be filled with my writings re mains largely empty.
Meanwhile, others with the training in scientific methods of approach which was denied to me, have gone far toward raising Southwestern archeology into the imposing historical edifice it is destined to become."
Despite Morris' words, his contributions were substantial and longlived, paving the way for a field that would captur e the inter est and imagination of students and the public alike.

He is an archeologist who works for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (B.I.A.).
Peter was born in East Orange, Ne w Jersey and was raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Peter went to school at Jefferson Middle School and M enaul H igh School in Albuquerque.
He earned two bachelor's degrees and one master's degree.
How did you become interested in archeology? I took a wide variety of classes at the University of New Mexico.
I enjoyed anthropology classes the most, particularly archeology which covered ancient ruins and peoples.
I was interested in digging and learning about the past through archeology.
When did you decide to be an archeologist? I decided to be an archeologist when I was taking classes in my junior year of college.
It was a hard decision to figure out what kind of archeologist I wanted to be and I didn't want to make the wrong decision.
I wanted to be an archeological survey worker first to get the hang of everything and to watch other people work on all the different archeology jobs.
What kinds of archeology jobs have you had? I have had tons of jobs and have enjoyed ever y one of them.
First, I worked as a survey worker.
Then, I decided to do the digging part and I really loved working in the dir t.
Since working for the B.I.A.
I have excavated and surveyed at all the pueblos, for the Ramah Navajo, and the Utes in Southern Colorado.
What do you like about being an archeologist? I especially like the thrill of digging in the dirt and making discoveries about the past.
Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES R -7 What do you dislike about being an archeologist? I do not like people digging without a degree and without permission.
It shows that people do not respect their past and its legacy on the land.
I also do not enjoy the general lack of job security.
Have you made any important discoveries? In Chaco Canyon I worked with a team of archeologists who made important discoveries about life in Chaco and kept alive discussions about the past for Southwestern archeology.
I found lots of neat stuff pots, fetishes, ornaments, and other tools and was absolutely thrilled with all the exciting artifacts.
What advice would you give a person considering a career? Choose wisely and be careful about your choice to be an archeologist.
What else would you like to tell people about archeology? Archeology is adventurous and I really love it.
I hope more people get interested in archeology so they can experience the adventures of archeology.
I encourage children to get into archeology and just see what it's like.
EDITOR'S NOTE: Peter's experience with archeology is extensive.
He has surveyed and excavated sites in Chaco Canyon and throughout New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas.
Peter's R-8 passionate and continuing interest in Aztec Ruins has resulted from his survey work, limited excavations, documentation of walls and wood, and treering sampling at the site.
Peter helped locate and describe the community of smaller sites associated with the early portion of Aztec Ruins.
He notes that the organization and symmetrical arrangement of the Aztec Ruins and community indicates a high order of planning.
He advances the idea that much of the important functions of Chaco Canyon may have been moved to Aztec Ruins through colonization.
He was interested to find that tree-ring dating in the East Ruin revealed that many of the dates were more recent than expected (AD 1200s) while the structure itself shows a continuation of building style and dates with the West Ruin.
Although Peter says the digging and surveying is fun, that's really the easy part.
The real work and excitement come through analysis and writing and putting together the pieces of the past puzzle.
Even though he enjoys the work, he cautions young students wondering about pursuing archeology as a career.
It's a lot of work, and it's not a way to get rich easily, quickly, or at all.
Peter said archeology could be very satisfying as a career but it calls for ability, luck, dedication, and persistence, usually without great financial rewards.
Peter earned bachelor's degrees in history and anthropology from University of New Mexico, and a master's degree in anthropology from Eastern New Mexico University.

He got a bachelor's degree in anthropology from the Univ ersity of North Carolina.
At the University of Ne w Mexico he earned a master's degree.
How did you become interested in archeology? I became interested in archeology because I always enjoyed old things.
When did you decide to be an archeologist? I thought about becoming an archeologist in 1967, and became an archeologist in 1970.
What kinds of archeology jobs have you had? I have had archeology jobs in the U.S. Forest Service, contract agencies, and National Park Service.
What do you like about being an archeologist? I enjoy archeology because I like being outdoors, wor king with friends, and being a detective.
What do you dislike about being an archeologist? I dislike working for bureaucracy which is part of the U.S. government.
Have you made any important discoveries? While studying the use of turquoise among prehistoric people, I found that ants seem to like the color blue in the stones they place as solar shields over their nests.
I think they absorb heat just right for them.
Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES R -9 What advice would you give a person considering a career in archeology? I would say that you have to like being a detective; you have to know math and computers, and you have to be curious and want to read if you want to be an archeologist.
What else would you like to tell people about archeology? Archeology can be fun or boring.
You learn about history, people, and nature.
Along with other archeologists, I collect wood samples and date the tree rings in them.
EDITOR'S NOTE: Tom Windes works for the National Park Service as a research archeologist.
He spends much of his time writing archeological reports about the work done at Chaco Culture National Historical Park in past years.
His interest in Aztec Ruins has focused on the wood used by the original builders in the structures.
There are about 5,000 pieces of original wood at Aztec, and Tom hopes he can obtain samples from every piece that will allow him to get tree ring dates.
As of 1998 he and volunteer workers have collected about 2,000 samples.
Through his work, Tom has refined the chronology of the buildings at Aztec, determining when sections of the buildings were initially constructed and/ or remodeled.
He has also ascertained the proportions of species of wood that the builders used throughout the 200-year occupation, which tells us how far the builders traveled to obtain wood at different times.
Tom and crew have also taken wood samples from the visitor center, where he found that early archeologist Earl Morris used salvaged wood from the site on the front portico and in the lobby.
R -10 Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES Dabney Ford Archeologist Profile When did you decide to become an archeologist? When I was in college.
I was only going to work archeology for a few years and then pursue agriculture.
What kind of archeology jobs have you had? Excavations for the state, some private and federal jobs, inventory surveys and preservation.
What do you enjoy about being an archeologist? I am more interested in history and the past than in the present or the future.
Being an archeologist allows me to study the past.
You never really know the truth or reality.
What do you dislike about being an archeologist? Having to work in a bureaucracy with the paperwork.
Have you made any important discoveries? Yes that we cannot understand the complexity of the prehistoric cultures of the Southwest.
R Dabney Ford lives in La Plata, New Mexico.
She commutes to Chaco Culture National Historical Park every week where she is the Chief of Resources Management and Archeologist.
She was born in Pullman, Washington, but grew up on her grandpar ents' ranch in Catron County, New Mexico.
She earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology and general agriculture from New Mexico State University.
How did you become interested in archeology? I grew up on a ranch with my grandparents.
There were more prehistoric than modern sites there and I wondered what they were.
I wanted to know how the land supported more people in the past than it does today.
Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES -11 What experiences have you had working at Aztec Ruins National Monument? My experiences at Aztec include architectural documentation, mapping, and wood sampling for dating.
Additionally, I have worked with the preservation staff.
What advice would you give a young person considering a career in archeology? To consider preservation disciplines such as chemistry and architectural engineering as a focus.
The research is easy compared to the challenge of preservation.
What else would you like to tell people about archeology? Archeology is multidisciplinary.
The more disciplines involved, such as astronomy, engineering, agriculture, and ar chitectur e, the better the study.
You are studying people who were multidimensional.
The more knowledge you can bring the more accurate the study.
R -12 Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES Joseph James Trott Archeologist Profile about age 10 or 11.
Then I visited relatives in Arizona who introduced me to archeological sites.
That summer I visited Mesa Verde National Park and became interested in man's history and the history of other animals.
When did you decide to become an archeologist? I decided to become an archeologist around the age of 14 or 15.
Jim Trott lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico where he is a Supervisory Archeologist for the Intermountain Region of the National Park Service.
He was born and grew up in Colorado.
He earned an associate's degree in 1968 from Trinidad State Junior College, a bachelor's degree from University of Colorado in 1970, and a master's degree in anthropology, specializing in archeology, from Colorado State University.
How did you become interested in archeology? The area in Colorado where I grew up was rich in fossils, including the remains of dinosaurs and ancient sea life.
As a child I collected fossils until What kind of archeology jobs have you had? The types of jobs I have had include working as a student on numerous archeological excavations and surveys from Arizona to North Dakota.
I have worked as a seasonal park ranger at Mesa Verde National Park, Project Archeologist at the Museum of Northern Arizona, Park Archeologist for Chaco Canyon National Historical Park and Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, and as the Supervisory Archeologist for the Architectural Conservation Program in Santa Fe.
These positions have involved historic and prehistoric archeology.
Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES R -13 What do you enjoy about being an archeologist? I enjoy archeological excavation and survey, the sense of discovery, and trying to make sense of the remaining evidence of the past.
I enjoy the aspect of archeology where I realize that something has been around for several hundred years, such as the rooms at Aztec.
I have always enjoyed the people involved in this field; they are frequently interesting and unique individuals.
What do you dislike about being an archeologist? Paperwork!! There can be an immense amount of paperwork associated with the job.
Have you made any important discoveries? All discoveries are significant as they add evidence to man's past.
What experiences have you had working at A ztec R uins National Monument? I have worked several projects at Aztec beginning with the Ruins Stabilization Training Course in 1978.
Since that time I have worked closely with the staff at A ztec in numer ous stabilization projects.
I have also participated in other past projects that included reburial of various excavations, construction of the handicapped trail, and repatriation of remains.
Recently I worked on the Backfilling Scope of Work for the West -14 Ruin and documentation of the West Ruin.
What advice would you give a young person considering a career in archeology? Try it first and see if you like it.
Volunteer for a park or archeological business to get experience, or join the state amateur society and see if it is something you would enjoy doing.
There are many different aspects of archeology from field research to laboratory analysis and archeological theory.
No archeologist can be competent in all fields of archeology that allows him/her to participate in archeology beyond the field work level.
You may not like excavation but enjoy analysis of artifacts, evidence of past climates, or dating the past.
It is a diverse field.
If you enjoy working in archeology stick with it.
It can be rewarding.
You will probably never get rich in archeology, but people do make a reasonable living doing something they enjoy.
What else would you like to tell people about archeology? Archeology is fun if you enjoy it.
However, there is an increasing amount of destruction and loss of archeological sites due to vandalism (pot hunting) and construction.
It is increasingly important people appreciate these resources and save them for future archeology and the public.
Only the public can protect archeological resources and in the end it is the public that benefits from archeology.
Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES R John Stein Archeologist Profile describe this attraction in a way that made it understandable, then I would be a famous author and not an archeologist.
The moral of this paragraph is that if I had more artistic talent I would be painting water colors of windmills and barns and mine tipples and locomotives.
But I am not a talented artist, I am a materialist, the kind of guy that collects bottle caps and rusty nails, and that makes me an archeologist.
When did you decide to become an archeologist? I never did actually decide to become an archeologist.
In 1970 and 1971 I had worked with Dr. Florence Ellis, and had done some salvage excavation at Bandelier.
Dr. Ellis finally took me by the ear to Dr. Lister, Director of the Chaco Center and said, "Give this young man a job."
What kind of archeology jobs have you had? Much of my experience is what they call inventory or survey.
I specialize in finding and recording stuff on regional scales such as thematic reconnaissance for certain types of remains such as precolumbian roadways or intensive surveys of reservoirs, parks, John Stein lives near Gallup, New Mexico.
He is the program manager of the Chaco Protection Sites Program in the Historic Preservation Department of the Navajo Nation.
Born in Chandler, Oklahoma, John and his family settled in New Mexico when he was six.
He attended New Mexico State University.
How did you become interested in archeology? I really like trucks.
And bits and pieces of machinery and nuts and bolts and anything iron.
I especially like this stuff if it is rusty and abandoned.
I am also attracted like a magnet to weathered wood, and again especially if it still clings to the frame of an old building.
If I could Aztec Ruins National Monument: RESOURCES R -15 pipelines or land exchanges.
I have worked for everybody in the Southwest, including the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the University of New Mexico, the New Mexico State Historic Preservation Office, the Museum of New Mexico, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
I have done excavation work at the pueblo of Tsama, Bandelier, Monte Alban in Mexico, areas of the Rio Grande Valley, Hopi, Canyon de Chelly, and Keet Siel.
I was the Roads Archeologist at the Navajo Area Bureau of Indian Affairs.
What do you enjoy about being an archeologist? The best thing about being an archeologist is still the idea that archeological stuff is out of doors.
What do you dislike about being an archeologist? Archeology is a legislated profession.
Most archeologists working in the United States are doing so because of federal preservation legislation.
Unless you are working for a federal, state, or tribal government, employment is likely to be on a contract basis.
Jobs and job security are hard to find in archeology.
Have you made any important discoveries? A bunch actually, but it depends on what is meant by "important."
Since the middle 1970s I have been fortunate to have worked regionally on a series of projects aimed at finding gr eat kiv as, gr eat houses, and precolumbian roads.
This has enabled us to model the evolution of Anasazi communities and the relationship of these communities to Chaco Canyon and Aztec.
Some of my most important and exciting "discoveries" have been made by learning to see things I thought I already knew everything there was to know about, from a different perspective.
An example is my current work at the Ne w comb , S kunk Springs, and Crumbled H ouse Chaco Pr otection S ites.
I hav e worked for these locations for 20 years and yet by using information from Navajo Medicine Men and new computer imaging technology, what we are finding is so new to me that it is as if I had never worked there at all.
